Noel is super chill and helps you envision how the piercing will look on your face. I went in for a nostril piercing, and he coached me through the whole process, even bringing me water and a glucose tablet when I started to feel lightheaded. The piercing looks great, and is healing well with the aftercare instructions he gave me. He also removed, cleaned, and replaced a poorly pierced helix piercing on my right ear, which completely healed within on week. This is the place to go (and where all of the errors of other shops go to get fixed)!<//Text>

Gave this place chance and contacted an artist about a piece of artwork that I wanted on my body permanently. The environment was top notch and very friendly, but when it came down to fundamental tattooing, it was lacking to say the least. Very disappointed that I have to look at this everyday and not be happy with what it COULD have been and over paying for it. Do your research before coming here.</Review>

<Time>1603501242918<//Time><rating>1</rating><Text>Thought I’d give this place a chance to do a tattoo coverup. The tattoo artist (Nathan aka Dogg) agreed to do it. He agreed to communicate via text message, which was good with me. I sent him all the information he requested, several days past with no reply, so I called him direct we spoke and we agreed he’d have appointment time & sketch ready. He has yet to reply to any of my messages. He’s never at the shop when we stop by...  Beware he’ll take your $ deposit.  After reading the posted review before mine, I’d say the fact that he didn’t do my tattoo  is a blessing in disguise.<//Text>< pics>

Got my septum pierced today by Ashton & he was amazing! He explained everything he was doing & was pretty gentle. He was always checking if I was okay before, during and after the procedure. He’s a great piercer. I definitely recommend him for piercings 👍</Review>

<Text>I'm a truck driver from Indiana and while my truck was in the shop I wanted to get a tattoo so I looked up tattoo shops on Google and this one popped up. About 5 blocks away I called and asked if they take debit cards. Brian answered the phone and said they did take debit cards and I told him I was walking and he asked where I was and what I was wearing. He said "I'll come and get you and bring you to the shop". He picked me up, took me to the shop, did my tattoo and brought me back to my hotel when he was done. Very impressed and glad that he did all of that when he didn't have to. I highly recommend this shop. Next time I'm in Bakersfield, I'll be sure to stop in again. Props to Brian for going out of his way to make my experience a good one.</Text>< user>

We went last night and he ran off the car to go ask some of the tattoo artists that were standing around outside doing nothing. The first artist he told about the tattoo shook his head NO (didn't even speak) for whatever reason we don't know so he refused and turned money away. One of the other artists told him "No, I'm not going to ruin her life." First of all you never tell a customer that rude comment EVER!!!! He refused to do the tattoo because he said he was going to ruin my life. WHAT DOES THAT EVEN MEAN???? The guy was lucky I wasn't there or else I would have went off on him. What logic sense does that even make?? It doesn't. He doesn't have a say about what goes on in my life PERIOD. I have a great career, beautiful home, and family so where does this guy get off telling someone a rude comment like that? They kind of laughed about it and asked my boyfriend if I had any other tattoos. AGAIN why is that any of their business. I've never had a problem getting tattoos before. Never had to explain myself to an artist like that before. They were rude and super unprofessional and made that shop look horrible.  They were aggressive, rude, and cocky. The owner should be embarrassed by these artists for their immature behavior. And for their information I do have a ton of other tattoos that I had ZERO trouble getting at other shops. I was willing to give this shop a chance, but they totally just lost out on money from me, I will never go there! I ended up going to Kustom Creations tattoo shop and got exactly what I wanted from a very professional mannered tattoo artist named Casper. He was amazing and gave me what I wanted no questions asked and it came out beautifully no thanks for Modern Electric Tattoo. Thanks for nothing. And yes that was me passing by in a car shouting I D I O T S to the rude artists standing outside that refused to do my tattoo.<//review>< Pictures>

Amy does a great job with her piercings. The shop has a good vibe. I'll never go to anyone else for a piercing, she is very gentle. I could barely feel my septum piercing. She's very thorough and clean. Highly recommend getting your piercings from her!</Text>

<Text>I was referred here by a friend and I could not have been more satisfied with my experience. The gentleman who did my smiley piercing was WONDERFUL. He took his time to make sure I was comfortable and asked often to make sure I wasn't in any pain and he thoroughly explained the cleaning process afterwards. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking to get a piercing or tattoo.<//Text><gmapID>0x80ea698ba1b7992f:0x9a463f212bd2a083< /gmapID><Rating>5</Rating><pics>None< /pics></record></dataset><record>

I came here because a friend told me to. WOW! There are so many corporate hair places and this is like a time machine. Rolland says he does womens hair too but I'm going to comment from the male perspective. If you want an old school hair cut this is it. Frank Sinatra was playing, my hair is short but Rolland took his time (hour ) and I appreciated that. He was meticulous about getting it right. Not only did he cut my hair, he trimmed my ear hair, nose hair and eye brows. Instead of the buzzers he used hot lather and a straight razor on my neck, face and sideburns, complete with hot towel before, cold towel after, aftershave and a massage! This truly was an experience and he only charges $16 for the whole thing!!! I paid $30 because it's a new business and I really appreciated the commitment to quality. I will be back as long as I'm in Bakersfield.</review>

My sister and I just got our piercings here on Tuesday, my sister had her nose pierced as I had my tongue. The guy that brought us back and pierced us was super sweet and took his time to make sure we got what we wanted exactly how we wanted it, as he was preparing to pierce my sisters nose he would take the time to ask and make sure that I was feeling good after I had got my tongue pierced seeing as I was the first one up. My sister and I really love our piercings, so if you are someone looking to get a piercing or two I highly recommend coming to Modern Electric. The people are very kind, welcoming, and try to make your experience the best.<//text>

Met with zach aka Budah and asked for something very specific. What I received was completely different then what was stenciled on me! They let me leave with blood covering my tattoo. When I asked for my money back I was refused and bullied. I know have to get laser tattoo removal, that is very expensive. I am a young girl and my self esteem is very low now and I feel violated after what they did to me! Don't be the next victim!< /Text>

I've been mulling over getting my ears pierced for awhile, but have been waiting to find a local shop to rely on. On September 7th, I came home from Ventura and decided, let's go! After reviewing a few of the local shops in downtown Bakersfield, I went with these guys. They have the kind of reputation you can trust. Upon visiting the shop, you're greeted by their great and electric staff, everyone is welcoming, vs the feeling of dropping into some cult dungeon.  After talking to the gentleman about my querie, I was met with Amy Von, one of their piercing people. She was greatly informative, discussed the options vs 16 gage or the 14s which I went with, the cleaning everything. They strictly use new from box packaged sterile materials, which they open in front of you (this offers piece of mind from the apple and ice cube days), and voila, you're good to go. She made great conversation, the whole process when very well, and I'm thoroughly pleased with my experience. Their shop also habors two tattoo artists that's been working steady for the last 21 years, EACH, not combined, as well as 3 other guys, and they regularly have guest artists. Worth a stop in for your metal or ink needs.<//text>

My favorite Subway!! I travel for work a lot and will pass 10 other subways to come to this one. The staff goes way beyond what you would expect for a Subway. It's the little things they do for you, like wrapping your footlong in to 2 separate packages when they know you'll be on the road. Or just making every sandwich look really good, not just thrown together. And to top it all off the staff is superb! Wish all restaurants took this kind of care in taking care of the customer. Such a great experience every time. Thanks so much to the staff!!<//review>

（你要先把卡车停在4-19的任何一个dock上再去办公室做check in，再电脑上填写资料，具体参考我上传照片照片，都是货单上的信息，最后签名保存）阿狼（2020年09月21日留言）</Review>

(Translated by Google) It is a lousy place to load as a carrier in Otay Mesa, having the worst 3rd place to load with RL Jones in 2nd and House in 1st, it takes you at least 3 hours to load, the Shipper and Pedimento system are very efficient, but for loading and unloading you can lose even up to 7 or 8 hours, they are really bad in this area.

<review>There must have been some kind of change for the better. My appt time when i check in goes by quickly my doctor is great she ordered test about my concerns and found out the why. After going to different doctors for year Dr. K to me is good to me she listens and follows through with your concerns and addresses them. Lab work was quick not a long wait at all. Receptionists are pleasant. Even security. I hope they keep up the work and continue with fast sufficient service😊For me knowing how some clinics in this area operate with poor slow service and rude receptionists. So far this is a good clinic for me and my family😀💖<//review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

I was having a migraine and they wouldn’t see me because apparently a migraine is a COVID symptom. I didn’t even have a temperature or anything else just needed help since over the counter was not working. They’ll telll you anything to get you to leave, and send you to the ER for something they could have helped with. Ridiculous.< /Text>

<Review>I wish I can give this place NO STARS. Very rude receptionist. She wouldn’t even give me an appointment for my son and when I asked to speak to her office manager she told me no that she’s busy. What kind of professionalism is that ?! I could barely understand the woman with her weird accent. Do not come here. I like Palmdale pediatric they’re good.</Review>< Pics>

I can't even speak to anyone, I've called so many times and I press all these numbers to get through to make an appointment and its just a recording saying "we're sorry, we can not take your call right now". This is during business hours, morning and afternoon calls. I can't even make an appointment</Review>

Took my son to the urgent care. Getting in to do vitals and to a room was very fast. Literally called our number immediately after we got there. Paperwork was pretty quick. We did show up soon after they’d first opened. All the nurses were extremely nice and helpful plus the x-ray tech was awesome. The only thing that was a bit rough was waiting in our room for about an hour just to see the doctor and then maybe another 10 minutes to see the follow up nurse after we went to get a chest x-ray. It was definitely better than being in the main lobby and getting coughed on by other sick kids when that’s what I’d already brought my son in for... turns out he most likely has bronchitis so I also didn’t want him coughing on anyone else anyways but it’s also good that he didn’t get the chance. However he’s four and was bored because it’s doctors office and the TV is just in the main waiting room so there wasn’t much for him to do other than letting him play a bit of “doctor”. We saw Dr Vallejo-Sinavsky and she was patient and made sure to remind me to catch my son up on his most recent vaccinations that I had let slide.< /text>

<Review>AVOID!!!!! Horrible bedside manner from both the doctors and nurses. If you do decide to go be prepared to spend your whole day there and only spend 10 minutes with the doctor when he gets to you. This place needs to be checked out or shut down. They don’t help you.< /Review><username>Paula Gonzalez< /username><Resp>None<//Resp></record>

<review>Excessive wait times with an unprofessional and uncaring staff. One doctor was so rude that a nurse apologized for her behavior. One time, my paperwork got mixed up with another person and they did not give a damn and even laughed about it. I hate this place, but I have no option. I stopped taking my medication because I can't stand this place and it's nearly a traumatic experience every time, I'm not even exaggerating.< /review><Rating>1< /Rating>< Response>

Yes the wait sucks especially when you have to go do alot of things ...the reason why I give it 3 stars is cause at the urgent care there’s this older doctor... always give me the right prescription.. never had to come back shows he’s a good doctor! Absolutely outstanding.</text>

I Was sitting in the waiting room for 5 hours and still did not get seen. Nurses were outside on their phones and in their cars. Triage nurse falsified documents saying we came at a later time than when we arrived. This place is literally the worst. There is a roomful of sick people there any time of the day, and they still take their time to see a significant amount of patients.< /Review>

If I could give zero stars I would. Don’t come here at all if you are in need of good services. I had a family member come for a chest x-ray, they waited for two hours and weren’t even seen by the doctor. The nurse said she reschuled them and when they went back for their appointment they were made aware that the nurse never reschuled it. I guess they were to busy gossiping about their personal lives during their Christmas party.<//Review>

<review>First of all let me start by saying I have no problems with the nurses they were helping me out with all the questions I had but when it came down to being checked by doctor Vogler it went to hell. She started to criticize instead of tryin to help she was very very judgmental towards my life when that had nothing to do with my sickness. Also when I wanted to let her know about other symptoms she cut me off and instead told me that we can only focus on one thing like how does that make any sense when I’m coming here to be helped but instead we can only focus on one thing. Why be in the medical field if all your going to do is judge instead of help. HIGHLEY RECOMMEND YOU STAY AWAY FROM DOCTOR VOGLER!!!!!!<//review>< UserId.>

< review>
South valley clinic is the absolute worst !!! Since being their patient I have had to go to Palmdale regional every two months for the last year to get my anti-depressant as an emergency! (Because if my refill ends on Wednesday his nurses can’t put the request in until he is in office) Dr.khan only works half the week this is my primary care physician he can’t ever be reached and his nurses never relay the messages to him. So every other month I start going into really bad depression because my medication refills are not consistent it’s an unfair revolving door with this clinic. The staff is so rude , I’ve tried to get my refill through the urgent care when he is out of office and the urgent care has told me they stopped giving people they’re sike meds because they don’t actually have that authorization(after sitting there for 5 hours)!!!! I’m sick of this treatment it’s cruel and unjust I’ve made multiple complaints so have many many other patients at this clinic. I feel discriminated by my condition I never ever had this problem when I was a patient at cedars or UCLA , if you have serious issues this clinic treats you like your gum stuck on a shoe bottom line!!! Your better off going to th er than this pigs pin . oh an I’d like to talk about the cleanliness of this Facility it’s disgusting I have pictures of the room they put me in hair on the floor , dirty exam bed the paper was all crinkly and had GLITTER on it , floor looks like it’s never seen a mop . It’s very saddening the type of care you receive and how I’ve seen disabled patients sit there all day because they didn’t grab a number :( I gave my place (number) to an elderly black woman who was def I’m literally tearing up as I write this it’s so horrible please somebody do something about this !!!</review>

The nurses there are on point. You can tell these nurses care about the patients by the way they are none stop. I mean come on people they are human too they need a break here and there yet other patients only see the negative. I disagree. Great job all of you!!!! $< /review>

I hate this clinic. The wait time when you're waiting in the lobby isn't that bad, the real wait is when they finally put you in a room. It takes the doctor forever to come in which is odd because it's never a lot of people in there. Dr. Aravagiri is by far the worst doctor I ever had. She's nonchalant, lacks compassion, always in a rush and after all that time you waited to see her, does nothing for you!! You'd be wasting your time going to this clinic altogether.<//Text>

Terrible service. You are treated like a number, no compassion. I understand this place is busy but it is no excuse to treat patients like crap. Dr Gajo is one of the worst physicians I've ever encountered.<//Review>

I got there at 1:30 and didn't get called in until 3, no to mention I was in the room waiting to be seen my a Dr for 3 hours. Also check the time punch thing, because it's 2 hours ahead of time. So in reality they can say I went in at 3:30 not 1:30.</Review>< Pics>

WORST PLACE EVER! NO ONE WAS BEING PUT IN ROOM, NO ONE FOR OVER 2HRS. THEN FINALLY THEY PUT ME IN A ROOM AFTER THE 2hr WAIT, AND SOME OLD LADY COMES AFTER ANOTHER 30 MINUTES, TELLS ME I CANT BE ON MY PHONE!
WHAT ELSE DOES ONE DO WHEN YOUR SITTING IN A ROOM FOREVER WAITING?????
THAT IS UNREASONBLE TO ME.  TURNS OUT THE INVISABLE NURSES WERE ALREADY SUPPOSED TO HAVE COME FOR A URINE SAMPLE,
WHICH THEY NEVER DID.
NURSE COMES IN FINALLY, HANDS ME A CUP, NOW BY NOW I AM FURIOUS, I CANT BE ON MY PHONE AND NO ONE IS DOING THEIR JOB!
I ASK HER, "HOW LONG IS THIS GONNA TAKE?" SHE SAYS..." URINE WILL BE ANOTHER 30 Min and XRAY AWHILE"
SO I AM THINKING,
NO PHONE, AND A ANOTHER 2-3 HOURS?
NO THANKS....RATHER SUFFER!
THIS IS WHY KAISER ROCKS!<//review>

I came to urgent care , I've been here for 3 1/2 hours and still waiting. When you ask the staff all they say is I don't know. A family of one of the people that sign you in came in and got seen right away, very unprofessional and rude , don't answer questions and everyone is freezing in here. Horrible horrible!!<//review>

I wish i could give this place -5 stars . This is the worst Dr's office i have ever been too. You have to wait hours even with an appointment. My appointment was at 9:00 i wasn't seen til 1:00. And this is everytime i go no matter if it's an appointment for me or my children . Then when you finally see the Dr. after hours of waiting they don't want to listen to your concerns or issues its always a rush never a caring feeling you should feel when you go see your primary care physician. One Dr. In particular Dr. Vasuki Aravagiri is the worst Dr. i have ever ran across. She doesn't listen ,always has a attitude with patients and nurses,  and talks to you like you're a none factor as if she's not getting paid for her sevices. If you are a Dr. and don't care about people or life in general WHY are you in the medical field? I will be finding a new primary care physician for my family. Thanks alot for a whole bunch of wasted time and frustration .</Review>

(Translated by Google) The staff is nice but the wait is eternal, once there was only one person and I in the waiting room to attend, and it took two hours to attend to me, when you go to your appointment, go prepared to spend a minimum of 2 to 3 hours.

I've been coming here for years, prices are great, cabinets are of great quality and the staff is super helpful. Sam is the greatest. He knows his stuff and will listen to your input to help you design the best looking kitchen with minimal issues. Definitely a place to consider when looking for cabinets.</review>

Excellent customer service, friendly staff, great communication, well done job. It was a pleasure working with Thomas who designed our kitchen cabinets and walked us through the whole process. He is so nice, extremely helpful and patient, and very professional. So is John who installed the cabinets. We are glad we found this company and we highly recommend it. Ask for Thomas...</review>

<text>Extremely happy with the high quality and contemporary looks of FX kitchen cab (with warranty).  Sam and Tony are super patient, professional and knowledgable.  I am hard to please.  Sam designed a 3D layout for me.  I made them change the drawings and specs numerous times and they still greet me with a smile every time I walked in.
I will definitely go back if I need bath or kit cab in the future.
Oh, they also recommended an installer for me.  He was beyond great.  Excellent workmanship.<//text>< UserId.>

<Text>They are very helpful designing your kitchen.  They could get busy and it might take you a while to get your turn. The options are a little limited regarding dimensions, but it is expected since the cabinets are pre-made.  The quality of the cabinets seems good but not top of the line, which is expected.</Text><date>1502817045978< /date><Pics>None< /Pics><username>Gus Razo< /username><Gmap_id>0x80c2d6ee1cb7b32f:0x7a78d5cf88fa4cd0<//Gmap_id><Rate>4</Rate><user>112154319007272008176< /user>< Response>

<Review>I shopped around so many places for a bathroom vanity. I fell in love with the cabinets and decided to cut out the middle person and went directly to the company. I got a great deal on my cabinet. As I picked up my cabinet in the loading dock.. I had the guy count my pieces. He was off and we had two missing pieces. Thank goodness I had him double check. Well now we are finally assembling the vanity which comes with very little instructions. Trust me we have experience in building them. But this brand offer no detailed instructions. Then they sold me handles that are probably not necessary they are no pre-drilled holes. I called the company and they  we're going to get someone who has experience and probably charge me around 150 to 200 dollars to help. We've text, we've called and no call back or anything.  We already partiality assembled. But it's aggravating not getting help. My own handy man can't figure it out either. And he knows since he remodeled our kitchen in one of our rental properties. Annoyed!</Review>< GmapID>

We have videos on our website that show you how to assemble cabinets (www.cabinetswarehouse.com) You can take a look and see if that helps. At this time we do not offer installation so we cannot physically send a staff member to assist you. We do have contractors that we recommend but we cannot control what they charge as they are a third party. If you  still need some help you can email me at contact@cabinetswarehouse.com and let me know exactly what part of assembly you are having a hard time with and I will try my best to guide you.'}</response>< Rating>

Took forever to check out, there was a line of 4 but only one lady at front desk. I only go here if I absolutely have to. I don't like that the vanity cabinets back does not go all the way to top, I always have to add a piece of wood so that I can screw down the plywood for countertop, I'll post a pic so you know what I mean< /text>

<rating>5<//rating><review>UPDATE to my earlier review below:  The company reached out to me right away to resolve the issue as there were some communication problems between the cabinet company and the company that sold me the cabinets.  They were very helpful in resolving my issue to my satisfaction and also gave me some other advice on the cabinets.
HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!   I ordered $9,000 of cabinets through a local cabinet company and it turned out that that 2 of the drawer bank sizes were no longer available so it was relayed to me that we could get a deeper drawer bank that could be cut down easily to fit the size I needed.  I was fine with that but nothing was mentioned about the drawer slides being too long.  When my cabinet company contacted them about getting the shorter slides that will fit in exchange for the longer ones that came with the kit they refused and are charging me another $150+ shipping.  While the cabinets are really nice, a lot of the pieces came scratched up or not fully stained and they want to charge me for touch up!  Im in the process of trying to return one of the boxes and trying to purchase the slides so we will see if I upgrade this review.  Too bad as they had potential and were referred by a contractor that was considering using them.</review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

Horrible service.  No greeting. Just sass. And the security guard smells like onions. Never eat at the deli. They have no clue about sanitation. Look at their salsa bar and tell me other wise. Horrible experience. The floor was clean.</text>

Nice Variety of Hispanic products; as merchandise from exportation is more expensive but Good special prices for the holidays 2020 in the meat department, I liked the freshness of the Menudo meat that I bought.<//review>

First time at this store. It gave a good impression on me. The store was clean thoroughly in every department, nicely stocked and faced, when we walked into the produce dept. You can smell the freshly ripened, clean fruits and vegetables. The meat/seafood dept had a selection of good quality Meats/Poultry/Seafood. Great customer service.  The butcher gave his full attention in helping us and making sure he helped my daughter in all her needs. The bakery was fully stocked with fresh bread. The store is not only a latino store but also have a little bit of everything that you may need to even freshly cooked take out food. The prices are affordable. I will be coming again❤< /Text>

Last 2 visits to the Deli/Restaurant were not worth 1 star. Ordered our Super Burritos and what we got were smaller than what can be bought at Taco Bell with less meat than in a Jack in the Box mini Taco, for a price that is too hi.<//text>

<Review>(Translated by Google) I didn't like the attention.
I bought maseca and asked how much it cost to a very nice young man and he gave me a price and when I was going to pay they charged me another price and they did not even check if it was correct, also they do not help to keep the things that one buys. I had to do it.
😐

(Original)
No me gustó la atención.
Compre maseca y pregunte cuanto costaba a un joven muy amable y me dio un precio ycuando iba a pagar me cobraron otro precio y ni siquiera checaron si era correcto, además no ayudan a guardar las cosas que uno compra .yo tuve que hacerlo.

(Translated by Google) The store is very spacious and clean. I give it 2 stars for customer service. The Cashiers are not friendly at all, and they reluctantly serve you. Also they do not want to fight anything, if you bring something in the basket, they force you to take everything out and put it on yourself, and they also do not pocket your things, they always ask you to do it! Bad service, bad face, and also loose all the ATMs !! I better give them 1 star;)

(Original)
La tienda está muy amplia y limpia. Le doy 2 estrellas por el service al cliente. Los Cajeros no son nada amables, y te atienden de muy mala gana.  Ademas no quieren batallar nada, si traes algo en la canasta, te obligan a sacar todo y ponerlo tu, y ademas no te embolsan tus cosas, siempre piden que tu lo hagas! Mal servicio, mala cara, y ademas flojos todos Los cajeros!! Mejor les doy 1 estrella ;)< /text>

<review>(Translated by Google) I have not really visited this shop much, but at first glance it has many products, it has a bakery, pastry shop and it has a place to buy prepared food and it has its tables for you to eat in there, its products are not cheap just like any Mexican store , the price of the meat was cheap and I liked the quality, the service was good.

<review>I got the fried tofu banh mi and it was delicious! Really great value for the price, and service was very fast. I didn't wait more than 5 minutes for my sandwich, and the man working there was friendly< /review>< pictures>

Decent meal, good price.  Pro tip: order through Yelp or Grubhub for takeout and you can use a card.  Otherwise, it's cash only.<//text>

One of the best in the city. Every bite of sandwich is an explosion of fresh veggies and savory deli meat. And the bread is always crusty and fluffy, never stale.</text>

I wanted some traditional style dishes that I can't seem to find in many restaurants. I got there Bánh Úót Dác Biêt which was so good the noodles are firm, chewy and fresh.  I will definitely go back and get there either dishes. I also got a dessert drink but I'm not sure what it's called. I wish they added ice to it. My daughter got time Bánh Mì Gà Xé (steam shredded chicken) which she said was good. Her dessert was mango pudding which she said was really good.</review>

< Review>
I ordered the BBQ Pork sandwhich, I was surprised how small the sandwhich was. I was the only one in there and it still took awhile to get my sandwhich to be made and the meat was very fatty, it seemed like cheap meats. The price does not reflect to the size and portion of the sandwhich.
It was $6.00, there are other bahn mi places better than this place.</Review>

I always come here for the Vietnamese sandwiches. My son especially loves the Fancy Pork sandwich. Every other place that I've gotten it for him, he does not like it, but this place he likes. He will always ask me, whenever I get a sandwich, if it was from here. The bbq pork is a little odd than normal from what I'm used to, but it's still decently tasty. Get the combination pork sandwich if you're not sure what to get. Their non-sandwich plates are not as good, but still worth a buy if you're hungry, or don't want to go to another store.< /Text>

Hands down, this is our family's favorite spot for Xoi (sticky rice) dishes and for BBQ pork and combination Banh Mi. This place is really good. Too many good dishes to list. I'm always coming over here from The Richmond. It's one of our staples.< /Text>

Very disappointing Vietnamese sandwiches. Pork combo had some kind of spam meat. Only shredded carrots as pickles. No jalapenos. Mediocre taste. I would avoid this place.<//Review>

<Text>i ordered the bbq chicken sandwich it was ok it could've been better but what i really liked was the sweet rice w/ taro beverage/dessert i got, it had a white sweet layer on top taste like the layer they put on top of a cake loved it with some green jelly & bits & pieces of taro, it was amazing! gonna come back to this place & try their other sweet desserts! i also noticed on the menu that they sell rice plates, i'll also give that a try next time i'm in the neighborhood.< /Text>< rate>

<gmap_id>0x80e825c86ae11c8b:0x2ff1aa9a7acc4859< /gmap_id><Review>Good food at a reasonable price. This place is near my work, so I've eaten here many times. They have all the popular Thai dishes in lunch or dinner portions. They have an $8 lunch special with chicken, seafood, beef, pork or vegetarian options, so there's something for everyone. They serve soups, noodles, rice or curries. Their appetizers are also very good. They accommodate small or large parties easily, and orders come out very quickly. If you're in the area looking for a Thai fix, give Exotic Thai a try (no pun intended).</Review><rate>4<//rate></record></dataset><record>

Service was friendly and quick. Food was flavorful. The exotic eggrolls were meh. The pad Thai was decent, and the spicy noodle dish was good as well. Asked for Cabernet got a Chardonnay. Simple misunderstanding. Would definitely be back to try more dishes.< /review>

Eh this was not a great option for me today   Parking is super easy as  there was no one in the restaurant and the restaurant is in a strip mall.

I came for lunch with my daughter and she ordered the chicken satay with peanut sauce. The sauce was very bland and the chicken was dry. I ordered the lunch special which was chicken basil, chicken didn't  taste cooked  so I skipped on eating it and the rice was super dry.  I'm sorry for not posting photos but it all looks bland.

The only thing good was my daughters company.</Text>

<Review>I would say this place is solidly BELOW AVERAGE and we’re pretty disappointed. when i’m paying for food, it has to be of a certain quality and I just don’t think this makes the cut. firstly: we ordered curry and it didn’t come with rice. who orders curry and doesn’t put it over rice? rice costs less than 50 cents to add so i really think it should come with saucy curries but if it really needs to be specified- make it clear! so disappointing to come home at 9 at night and need to make rice for a dish that definitely should have it.

as for quality, the noodle dishes come with the bare minimum (just brocoli and some bean sprouts). we also ordered the dumplings and what we received is a sad soggy wrap of unpleasant ingredients with a sickly sweet sauce.

no word how the curry is because we’re waiting on rice to try it.</Review>< Rate>

Went today 4 the first time! There were only 2 other customers, didn't allow my party of 8 to sit where we wanted. Rude customer service! Didnt greet my party, forced us to sit close to kitchen!! 2 waitresses looked mad, no smile on their faces. All talking and lsughing in thai native language? Very rude! One cutomer came in and walked out as the waitresses n the cook was rude to her! Poor cutomet services!! Would not recommend this place! What exoti? they first need to learn how to treat cutomers!! Would have walked out but with 4 young kids who wanted Thai food. There was no other Thai restaurant close by! Will NOT go there ever again!!<//text>

<review>My local favorite! Great food, courteous and fast service and very reasonable price. Chef has French influence so the food has great flavor. We eat here maybe 3 times a month. My favorites, chicken spinach soup, garlic shrimp and, of course, their Thai ice tea! Also, when in season don't miss mango and sticky rice!!
Delicious:)< /review>< Rate>

This is the Exotic Thai you want. The place by the theaters is okay, but for some reason the food here is so much better. Worth the drive for sure if you are close to the one in Agoura. Also, be on the lookout for coupons and send them my way please ;)< /Text>

I had been searching for good pad thai and I found it! The noodles were perfect, it was a little bit sweet, and it came without any spice so I was able to add it to my liking. I will definitely be back!< /review>

Best thai food you'll find around this area. Ask the chef (Pat) what looks good. My fav is the pad thai which I think is better than most in Hollywood (Thai town). Pleasant atmosphere, loads of parking, overall very good time. Try something new everytime you come - I have yet to be disappointed.<//Text>

Great food with good price. The noodles here are so yummy and full of flavor! It was too good! The dry noodles were a perfect bouncy consistency and the clear broth on the side was also very very tasty. Highly recommend.</Review>

The soups, noodle bowls, lemon grass chicken are all very delicious. However the best thing I have ever eaten here is the yellow curry chicken. It comes in yellow, green or red. Yellow is least spicy, red is the most spicy. It is not on the menu though. Secret menu item. Delicious!< /review>

This is my all time favorite noodle house. Service was pretty friendly. Food came out very quickly, about 5-10 minutes after we ordered. The noodle was very taste. This My Van Restaurant noodle & drink place is great.<//Review>

I love My Van Restaurant Vietnamese Noodle & Drink.
But you have to know what to eat when coming here. I love to eat their dishes and that was fantastic. The appetizer fried rolls and steamed shrimp with rice noodle rolls are so good. There is a soup with tofu and I forget the name, but it is the best thing to eat when you are sick.</text>

I love to eat their noodles. I get a custom order with fried fish cake and the flat fat rice noodles. They also have the best 4 color bean drink/dessert. Instead of the green jelly, you can get the coffee jelly. it's so delicious!</Text>

<Review>Great place, tasty food !! I never posted review for any restaurant since we all eat tasty food every day. This time, however, I must give this place a five star for its great tastes. Just close your eyes and point random dishes on the menu. ALL are so tasty.< /Review>< username>

This is a awesome place to go for noodles. It is clean and service is quick! I always get the Number 1 with flat rice noodles and soup on the side. It is absolutely my favorite food and I have it at least twice a month. Just Wooooooow :)< /text>

<review>Great food.  The soup and beef in the braised beef noodle soup were really good! The soup had a really good rich beef bone richness to it, so full of bone goodness that it was slightly milky. I would drink this as a standalone soup. The beef was really surprising. Just Wow</review><name>Ralph Langley< /name></record></dataset><record>

I am always looking for a good noodle place. I am impressed with this place. This is just what we like, good noodle & drink with fast service. The place is clean and the prices are fair. I would like to go this place again.< /text>

The food has a lot of flavor!
I came here for lunch with my dad. My dad ordered the noodles with pork chop and I ordered the rice with pork chop and shrimp paste cooked on a sugarcane. The pork chop actually had a nice charred flavor! I actually really liked it.</review>

This place is always packed but they are somehow always able to seat you fast. Very satisfying Noodle on a cold or hot day. The noodle & drink is always tasty. If you haven't been there yet, you need to try it at least once.<//text>

After an meeting at Sheraton hotel, we decided to go for lunch at this place. Small but Spendid. Food taste great, music is relaxing. Young servers were a bit new but had good manners. We all had a good time.
PS. their flvored tea is very good.< /review>

My family and I were duped by the 5 star reviews here on Google into dining at this establishment today and we couldn't have been more wrong! The waitress, who was rather polite, is in dire need of proper training as it was difficult for her to manage our table and a single diner at another table. The food fell short of the standards that one can expect at other Vietnamese restaurants in SGV. I have had my fair share of bun bo hue throughout socal. After scanning reviews/pictures, I thought I'd give it a try. However, when it reached the table there were NO pork knuckle (as I've seen or had), tons of cha lua and the smallest blood cube you will ever see in a bowl of BBH. Also, the pho orders had unacceptable amounts of meat. The pho tai had only 3 measly slices of meat and we had to bring this to their attention to get the rest of the meat. It could be that were Chinese and they probably didn't think we'd know any better.

NOW THE KICKER!!! After having had a poor experience, I decided to give these google reviews another look. OH BOY, I couldn't believe what I found! All these reviewers seemed to have, among others, the same contractor (Bella Vista General Contractor in IL), same attorney (Law Offices of Schlissel Décorpo in NY), home remodeling company (Silver Stone Home Remodeling n Winnetka), and happen to LOVE the same My Van Vietnamese restaurant here in good ol' Rosemead, Ca.  This urged me to dig a little deeper and do random image search. Turns out that reviewer Marie Manchester below had a different last name and lives in Manchester!

I'm upset that Google Review platform does not have the same IP address filter as yelp has. This would have saved my family and me from this less than average, deceitful restaurant. If you choose to dine here, just don't get your hopes too high because you've been warned.</text>< resp>

I'm so glad I chose to eat here instead of the McDonalds across the parking lot. (Although I may still get an ice cream Sunday from there) My server Kendy, did a 6 STAR job of tending to my wants and needs today. Saving MY VAN in my Google Maps for sure. I definitely will have ALOT of energy to complete the days tasks. Much love and THANK YOU Kendy! -S.S 💙🦈</Text>

I am a strong supporter of brands that provide above and beyond customer service, and Bose does just that!

The sales reps at this location are helpful and attentive without trying to push anything on to customers.<//Text>

Best customer service ever. Took my headphones in after they were about a year and a half old because the left side of the headphones stopped working and they replaced the headphones for free. In and out of the store in about 3 mins. Bose is a great product and great service< /review>

Clean store, had to wait a little bit because everyone was looking at the same product. Ended up not having what I was looking for.</Review>

<rating>5< /rating><Review>(Translated by Google) In the store you can find new and refurbished things including a warranty that is really worth it. The employees are very professional and patient. I bought really worthwhile refurbished headphones for half the price. Highly recommend both the store and the bose headphones from a different world than I knew.

בחנות אפשר למצוא דברים חדשים וגם מחודשים כולל אחריות שזה ממש שווה.העובדים מקצועיים וסבלנים מאוד .אני קניתי אוזניות ממש שוות מחודשות בחצי מחיר.ממליץ מאוד גם על החנות וגם על האוזניות של bose עולם אחר ממה שהכרתי.< /Review>< Pics>

A few friends and I went here for brunch for the first time. One of the prettiest bars I've seen. Excellent food.  While everything we had was really good, the falafel lettuce wraps were the star for me.<//text>

<review>We got the Rum Ginger and Bloody Mary cocktail, all of which are perfect with an incredible presentation, a drinking experience that is unreal. The drinks are awesome, the food is great, and the view is unbelievable.  For us, John was the server and he was wonderful. He gave us lots of awesome cocktail tips. He made our experience terrific. We will be back home again!</review></record></dataset><record>

Had a great brunch at The Misfit today. Ordered about half of the menu and everything came out fast and delicious. The team that works there is great, special shout out to Alex our server - he was funny and attentive and a good sport when I accidentally kicked my dogs water bowl onto his shoes. 11/10 would recommend :)<//text>

<Text>A very nice place to grab something quick to eat and drink. I ordered the bacon covered dates and I thought they were weird at first but they actually weren't too bad. They tasted a bit like sweet potato fries to me but nonetheless good. I was served the best fresh squeezed lemonade I ever had and my friend seemed to have enjoyed his drink as well.  They have a 1.5hr limit to cycle people in and out, loved the dim atmosphere and it was the perfect place to talk and chill.</Text>< Pics>

Always 5 Paws for this place. The staff is very friendly, they bring me water & grilled chimken, and give me lots of attention and compliments. The hoomans seem to enjoy the food and drinks as well. The Misfit is one of our go-tos for brunch, lunch and dinner. Truly a Santa Monica staple. XO, @thehungrydoodle</review>

This place looks like a castle on the inside and the food is delicious! Small portions, but quality food. It is pricey and there was a really long wait when we went (about 45 mins) on a Sunday morning. But it's a nice dining/brunch experience. This is a nice place to come on a special occasion, or if you live nearby, for a casual coffee + pastry breakfast. I'd definitely come back hopefully at a less busy time.</text>

<gmapID>0x80c2a4cfdd9c475f:0xa23e8d365323987< /gmapID><text>The food was delicious. Mussels (in a can) from Spain with sour dough crustini were delicious. The dipping sauces offered awesome extra punch of taste, esp the home made mustard. The prime rib sandwiches on hawaiian rolls, though small because they are sliders, we're delectable. The meat was perfectly medium rare and plentiful. But the best part was the drinks. We had the yellow jacket  - mescal, honey, spice - and a Paloma. Delicious and apparently part of an all day happy hour. Grateful for the folks sitting next to us who told us about it. The wait staff was attentive, always available, but a not as forthcoming with the happy hour options. We figured it out, and it was worth it. $5 drinks. I'll definitely go back, esp when indoor dining is back. The inside space is gorgeous.<//text><user_id>103747766318464642484</user_id>< Response>

I love this restaurant! Each time I'm in Santa Monica. The food was absolutely amazing and generous. Definitely order a side of French fries. They are perfection. Probably top 5 French fries I've had.
Best part of misfit? The free delicious chocolate chip cookies they give at the end. This time they were a bit heavy on the sea sat, but SO good!
Service is great. The decor is great, very relaxing and just atmosphere I would love for a date out...yes even with myself, those are the best!
Thank You, The Misfit!< /review>

Delicious crispy chicken sandwich. This is a is a very large and tasty sandwich. Chicken was perfectly crispy and moist. The size of the breast was large and was overflowing from the bun. Crispy part was slightly coming off the breast. Slaw  had a slight hint of spice and complemented the sandwich nicely. Bun was soft and warm. Came sliced. Priced moderately at $17. Would recommend and order again.<//Review>

<Review>Sam was the hostess and she was AMAZING!! From start to finish she was smart, kind, and adorable. She made my experience so much fun at the beginning and then Juan was very sweet, and just took care of me and my date so well. Also the food was phenomenal and worth every penny I spent! 10/10 would return.< /Review></record>

I'd come back here anytime. Plenty of outdoor covid seating with heaters. Happy hour starts at 4. $5 signature cocktails, 2 off certain beers amd wine. We had the mac n cheese and the bacon wrapped dates...it didn't disappoint.<//Text>

I was here for a work trip and I initially picked this place based on a picture I noticed and reviews. I was so NOT disappointed with the French fries (now I get why someone posted a picture of them! They were absolutely delicious!)

The place itself was very beautiful and clean!
I had absolutely NO complaints and would recommend this place to anyone!!!<//review>

I thought this bar was pretty epic, and I’d like to think I’m hard to impress. Service was amazing, and even though our cocktails were $15 apiece, we ordered many. They were just that good. Everyone at the bar enjoyed a fresh breeze & lively atmosphere, with open conversations and fresh opportunity for anyone with an open mind. What more could you ask for? Simply timeless.</review>

<Review>Great romantic spot for date night with dim lighting and unique, tasty menu. Also great for groups since seating is spacious and comfortable.Loved the cauliflower and the Brussels sprouts, spinach cavatelli (buttery and filling)Ordered the rice pudding for dessert which is plenty to share amongst a group of 3.</Review></record>

Delicious food and nice decor. Lentil soup, Mediterranean salad with chicken and dates  and seared ahi tuna burger was delicious. Would come here again and try the mixed drinks too. They have a brunch happy hour on the weekends.<//Review>

My friend and I had reservations at another restaurant but we saw Misfit and changed our mind and dined here. We opt to sit on the patio. It was a beautiful warm day and it was perfect.
The interior is a darker ambiance with a wall filled with alcohol.

Can't remember our servers name but he was very nice and pleasant.  He recommended a drink for my friend and she enjoyed it.

We had the shrimp ceviche and that was so refreshing.

Overall, I loved this restaurant.  Next time I'm in Santa Monica Imma definitely dine here again. Wanted to give a shout out to Nicholas! Thanks for the fun and laughter.</review>

Got skipped by the host/hostess multiple times before being sat. Cocktail menu is absolute trash we had three different ones and hated them all. “Double patty burger” is thinner than one normal sized patty hamburger. They do not cook burgers to temp and was brought out WELL DONE 🤢 When sat we were also told there is a strict one and a half hour time limit on tables, not like I would ever stay at this restaurant that long... The sever was not rude but certainly not nice. Don’t understand how this place has so many good reviews.< /text>

Enjoyed this experience.  The drinks were very good. The waiter name was Nathan and he was excellent.  We ordered various share items and you can see them in the pictures attached.  The skewers were excellent as well as the shrimp. The service was excellent.  Plates cleared quickly.  The food was delivered really fast and was prepared excellent.    The cookies you get at the completion of your meal have a slight salt taste and are excellent.  I would return to this resturant service is great, servers are friendly and extremely attentive to your needs.<//text>

Overall a really cool place that offers good eats. The service was outstanding. It is a little over priced but that is LA. It seemed like this place gets a nice mix of locals and tourists. I got the misfit burger which was a really good and filling meal. Fries must be ordered in addition to a sandwich, they don't come as a side.<//Text>

<text>As it located in a busy area with lot’s of one time costumer, their service and food is in average rating.  So if you didn’t eat there, you did not missed anything.  Actually it is applicable for most of restaurants in this area.  Some are better better than the others but not really a great choice.
There are multiple parking structure nearby which you can park your car there.<//text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP9Z_Nmo4X5pdnsPGPZ3ZWqBHf-ArvX_a5JnGIu=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMDs11ateytGzAWgcIipqptOlcO_nZRaH3doZlc=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMs6yjLbB5OfdB3kKmTA5oeP1XbosLq4Xh2ZL1U=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMAaEPaHFIfM6mdroezEVoDnbHcBeaYINupxUCy=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN4HOlEWXDRUb7QzuiOag5p3gyAI_ZuavJT2qEZ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPhLa2lqGFV6TLCmxOSLPSpY9Ww8x5BItuU3x6f=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics><resp>None<//resp><gmap_id>0x80c2a4cfdd9c475f:0xa23e8d365323987</gmap_id></record>

Truth be told, I'm here every other weekend. I brought my friend here and she has a nut allergy--usually people write a note for her and sometimes it's ignored. (My car has an infinite stack of Benadryl in it and an epipen for her) Not only did he make a note, he told the chef and made his manager aware. The staff is incredibly cool, the vibe is great and every other weekend's going towards every weekend. Tyler and Chase were great, the food is always great AND fast and I can get back to Real Life Mario Kart heading back to Normandie faster. 11/10</text>

The menu was extremely limited (they also had a small collection of standard bottled beer), so unless you really loved their take on Nashville hot fried chicken, your visits may be limited. Although I enjoyed the food and felt it was reasonably priced, I would be an occasional diner at best (I needed to try the mac & cheese!) if I needed a chicken fix since they were relatively close to me. Plus, it was always a pleasure to support a mom & pop small business. I found very good value based on the prices, service, and experience noted above (TOTAL paid experience was around $22.00 BEFORE any discounts and/or tip).

The seating is tight and the noise level is very high, we can hardly talk.  The food is ok but portion is very small.  I consider this place as three $ for pricing.</review>

Five stars basically for everything!

My uncle came to visit from Australia so my sister and I decided to take him out here with my parents on a Saturday night and it was the perfect spot.

We got seated upstairs where it was nice and cozy, less noise than downstairs, perfect dim lighting and an excellent waitress, wish I can remember her name. She was fast, helpful, sweet, and on top of it. We got lots of wine, none were disappointing and a couple of starters and different dishes. We loved the Brussels sprouts and their fries were also delicious!

The menu is simple, short, but with great variety of options. My uncle got the mussels with chorizo and he said it was mouth watering. My dad got the prime rib French dip nik niks and loved it, he's a super picky eater too! I got the misfit burger and it was mouth watering, cooked to perfection! My mom and sister got the crispy chicken sandwich which is extremely delicious and popular here. Basically, all of our taste buds were extremely satisfied by the time we were done. Definitely recommend it on a nice Saturday night for families and couples, anything goes!<//text>

Rude staff, substandard service, average food, overpriced.
The only good thing I have to say about this place is it’s cool interior, which thanks to Covid you won’t get to enjoy since you’d be sitting outside.
I really wanted to like this place considering the good reviews, but I definitely won’t be going back after our dinner experience tonight.< /review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Text>Great place, awesome atmosphere and interesting menu! Although it is big on drinks I didn't choose anything alcoholic instead the hot mint tea straight from an Oregon forest was very inspiring.. as those beautiful vegetarian options from which I had the sweet roasted potatoes and the vegan burger. Absolutely satisfying, full of taste, the  vegan bread was a revelation, awesome avocado and cashews' cheese, black beans patties, sounds simple but it was truly tasty.
Staff was kind, friendly and welcoming, my waitress in particular, a really beautiful supermodel-looking-like girl, was absolutely the best, thank you! :)

Excellent service, great food. They pride themselves on their artisan drinks, but most of the 12 craft mixed drinks are made with gin. If you're a vodka person, you're stuck with the basil gimlet. But it actually is pretty good. I ordered the pan-seared filet mignon, which was excellent. And if you're a 'Mad men' type of guy that loves whiskey and Old fashions?

I got the cured salmon toast, home-made croissant and pistachio & vanilla gelato.

The croissant was warm, big and buttery which made it extra delicious!

The cured salmon toast was also equally as delicious with a nice complex taste due to the addition of the sliced onions.

The gelato portion size was really big and I wasn't able to finish it myself - would be a great dessert to share. It was delicious as well.

The staff was very friendly, swift and super attentive. Will definitely come back here again!!!<//review>

The Misfit was one of my favorite restaurants in Santa Monica; however, the last few times have been surprisingly disappointing! Cleanliness is horrible, servers are no longer caring and professional, and food oh my god, 🤢 I hope they figure it out again. Still, I won’t be returning or recommending anyone here!< /review>

Not cheap, but you're less than 2 blocks from the ocean,if you're looking for a street taco for $1, then you're in the wrong place. Even when things go wrong (my food order didn't get printed in the kitchen) they fix it fast and professionally. I've been back, and will be back again!< /Text>< pictures>

The atmosphere is sexy, food is pretty good, and the portions are HUGE. However, it all seems a bit overpriced for what you get. My cocktails were boozy but I was expecting them to be a bit more thoughtful at the price point. Not a bad option by any means. Just not outstanding.</review>

<rate>5<//rate><text>Delish! We were walking around the Santa Monica Pier area and decided to look on Google Maps for a place to eat. This place popped up and had great reviews, so we decided to give it a try. I had the chicken sandwich which was fantastic! I highly recommend. Between the two of us it was about $55 for two chicken sandwiches, an order of fries (which could easily feed three), and two Cokes, so bear that in mind. The staff was friendly. The atmosphere was great as well.< /text>< pics>

The food is tasty but overpriced. Lunch for 2 with 1 drink cost almost 100 dollars. They have come up with all kinds of unusual combinations that are unique and interesting.  Some things I liked, others not so much.  Very trendy and mostly young crowd on Saturday afternoon.  The place was fast busier than I expected for 3pm Saturday.  Servers were nice but overall slow, Unless you are buying their expensive drinks.  Then they must have different servers.  The attractive young ladies at the table near us got lots of attentive service.  Go figure!</Review>

Pretty good spot, service was good, lemonade was great. Had the salmon skewers, a little heavy on the soy. The risotto was creamy, mushrooms were spot on with the perfect amount of cheese.

Overall ambiance was nice. Would recommend for the casual crowd for a night out in Santa Monica.< /review>

Misfit is an incredible place. Small plates, yummy food and amazing cocktails. Very impressed with this restaurant and I'm increasingly disappointed with restaurants these days. Great to try many different items and sample their yummy goodness. Loved the broccoli gnocchi, Mac n cheese, and the doctor is in cocktail. Definitely worth a visit!</text>

Well i've had my eye on this place for awhile now and we finally made the stop for dinner around 7pm. Misfit Restaurant is located just a few short blocks from the 3rd street promenade so its a great location. There is plenty of seating inside and outside and while the outside does come with heaters during the winter season, the inside can feel a little cramped at least our table did.

The service was really good and our server was awesome I wish I remembered her name. The fries were really good and came with a huge amount and served with honey mustard which I really liked. I also had the fried chicken sandwich and it was very tasty. Overall great place and nice touch with the complimentary cookies at the end I will be back soon to try their Ahi Burger.< /review>

<Text>Do you like $5 lunches? I do - which is why I take friends who are visiting during a weekday to the Misfit for the $5 Bar Fly deals. Monday-Friday the Misfit will have one dish for $5 if you sit at the bar between 12-4 (no saving seats). Happy hour also happens during the same time. My favorite is the fried chicken sandwich on Thursday’s. The chicken is moist on the inside but perfectly crunch on the outside and complemented by the coleslaw accompaniment.  On this visit, we tried the ahi tuna burger which was cooked rare and was so very good. I liked the brioche bun and there was a slight level of spiciness that went well with the pickle provided. They give you complimentary salt chocolate chip cookies at the end when you pay your check.

Love the food, the service is hit or miss. I think the bartenders get stressed when there are a lot of people and so you need to be patient. However the server who recently helped us thanked us for our patience and was nice overall. It might be a struggle to find a spot at the bar so just go during an off time to avoid crowds. The decor is cool and hip although it’s a bit annoying that the bathrooms are on the second floor. There’s indoor and outdoor seating.

Overall, given its proximity to Third St Promenade, this restaurant has really good food. Try to come during lunch or happy hour to take advantage of the deals, otherwise just enjoy the free chocolate chip cookies and know that you’re eating at a high quality restaurant.<//Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMg9d2cIy30m4vKO_rBvEyihm-6qA_eU4aWAwQD=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics><resp>None< /resp>< GmapID>

<text>Wonderful reviews drew us to visit this restaurant, but we weren’t too impressed. Service was great, but the food was mediocre. I really don’t like it when restaurants don’t list all the ingredients included in their entrees. I ordered a kale salad and it had onions and red peppers, which was not listed in the description. I don’t enjoy either vegetable, so I was disappointed. Also ordered the lobster rolls to share and those weren’t great either. Not the ‘lobster roll’ you would expect.

Fries we shared with friends were good. And they were super nice and brought me a dessert of fresh (super fresh!) mint chocolate chip ice cream and salted caramel chocolate chip cookies. Best part of the meal. I am not sure if we would go back based off the food. Ambience was really nice though.</text><rating>3</rating><Response>None<//Response>< gmap_id>

Good food, drinks, service, and atmosphere. We came without a reservation on a weekend, but only waited for 10 minutes, just enough time to grab a drink at the bar while we waited. They had a good craft beer selection and our server even offered us free salted chocolate chip cookies after our meal. We were very impressed all around.<//review>

<Rate>4< /Rate><Review>Came here with a couple of girlfriends on a Saturday night and it was vibin'.  We were able to grab drinks at the bar while we waited for our seats.  The servers were pretty attentive and food and drinks came out pretty quick.  As you walk in, your eyes are naturally drawn to the high ceilings and cool looking bar.  With a library style floor to ceiling shelving of liquor bottles and books at the top, the concept is pretty impressive and quite memorable.  It's quite dark and it gets super noisy - perfect if you're with a big group or a girl's night.

We ordered a couple of dishes to share and the Mac n Cheese was pretty good.  However, the sangria was less to be desired - super watery and the fruits they used seemed cheap or rather they ran out and they tried to scavenge what they could.</Review>< pics>

Found on Yelp with great reviews!  Loved the ambiance and decor.  Food was good BUT know restaurant's claim to fame is their shareable plates which were kinda small portions.  I don't eat a lot, so wasn't looking for obnoxious servings, but we came with 3 colligiate baseball boys so we needed the family size portions they touted as they were actually pretty small.  Luckily the boys got Ahi burgers, which were normal sized, paired with the $9 shareable French fries so they didn't go hungry.  Food was great tasting.....but shareable.  "Tapas" would be a more accurate size!<//review>

<Pics>None< /Pics><review>Interesting place!  The beer choices were decent although this place is more about cocktails.

I had the scallops and a dish with kale.  Both were super tasty.

It did take about 15 min before my order was taken sitting at the bar.

The happy hour was decent, but it wasn't clear at the beginning what was included and what was not (it's the little dot to the left of the menu item).< /review>< gmapID>

Highly recommended to hit this spot if you are in town.

Friendly wait staffs
Good food: all the dishes, Mac & cheese, ceviche, kales salad, we ordered were so good.
Good cocktails.

It was a perfect last stop in our recent LA trip that makes me want to go back again soon.< /Review>

<Review>This may be the coolest place in Santa Monica for brunch ... or drinks ... or dinner.  Very unique ambiance and interesting menu.  Please dont be like the d-bag who sat next to us and complained about everything, EVERYTHING.  Like the fact that one of the dishes that came with a spicy (not really) red sauce contained onions.  Dude - seriously?  I thought the food was good; but I also don't go to a restaurant to tell the chef how to make my dish.</Review><Name>Rob Richardson</Name></record></dataset><record>

<Review>I visited in May and loved everything- my cocktail, the brussels sprouts, and surprisingly the gf mac & cheese. I didn't think it would be that good, being made with gf pasta. I was wrong. I would say it's the best mac & cheese I've ever had, bar none (even my Granny's- don't tell her I said that). The service was excellent as well. I can't wait to come back in July.<//Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM_4AW1q2ZpNbrpUlWpC9JVz63sZ0T3Xqe1dBAp=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOSHxMp96rtYHiwuU_ABk19PMV3UShXCTHEodpT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP_0t7PY0RIczDxuE3JIbI8CgKGoQIA2OTPBG-o=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP5op3HuIsS0KDte1g_qgjRDfq7Hwe2DRvXuW07=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures>< Response>

<Response>None<//Response><text>1940s feel to this beautiful bar and restaurant. The food can be pricey but if you take advantage of the daily burger special (Wednesday is ahi Tuna) and the happy hour (every day until 7pm) it's very reasonable. Be sure to put your name on the list for a seat at the bar. Kevin the bartender will take great care of you and takes pride in his Mixology. I had the Mac n Cheese with chorizo. Despite its small appearance it the spot. The drink I had was good but not great. Kevin, without me even mentioning it, made me a new drink with the help of another bar tender and it was superb. They have a small outdoor seating area and a large indoor restaurant. It was bustling for a Wednesday afternoon. Highly recommend in Santa Monica!<//text>< date>

<Text>The Misfit has a feel to it that fit my mood on the day. The interior is darker and I loved the books on the high shelves.

The staff we friendly and helpful with suggestions and I enjoyed my lunch with a glass of wine.</Text>< user_id>

<Review>Celebrated a special day in Santa Monica today.  The Misfit is a favorite of ours.The most recent visit  however, was a little off.  The server was not having a good day.  We got through it because we were having a great day and didn't want it ruined.
The Moroccan chicken salad was delicious.  We also ordered fries. The were served promptly. We asked for an additional mustard-honey sauce and it arrived 20 minutes later, only after asking server other than ours to please bring it to enjoy with the now cold fries.The server apologized. We did not complain.

Thought we'd have dessert and asked specifically if the chocolate chip cookies with sea salt were still an item they served. Server said sure, warm from the oven. We said they would great with the gelato.  Promptly ordered pistachio gelato, slowly enjoyed it as we waited for a cookie....and waited and waited and waited. Finally the cold and broken and overly salty cookies arrived.
The gelato was melted and so was the impression that this establishment was consistent in their delivery of quality food and service.
Missteps at Misfit were the only hiccup in a beautiful day. Will hesitate to return.< /Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMDYL5aimkKZL2PZcQHVrWlVOpTvIHqMiYn5T8X=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><Response>None<//Response><GmapID>0x80c2a4cfdd9c475f:0xa23e8d365323987</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Great bar with an unbelievable tap list.  Dustin is an awesome barkeep that enjoys his job & shares his enthusiasm for beer.  Seriously good options for beer lovers and relaxed environment.  If you’re in the mood for a fun local bar experience with good food, drink & staff- jump into Misfit< /Text>

Fantastic service, delicious cocktails (had a lemony, honey mezcal up that was really good.), and top notch food. Scallops were perfect to start. Then had a perfect ahi tuna burger. They bring sea salt chocolate chip cookies at the end too! Love this place!</review>

<text>Great choice for an healthy (but not too much!) dinner and cocktails in Santa Monica. Food and service were impeccable. 1 star missing due to noise and tables being a bit too close to each other. Try the wild broccoli gnocchi spicy cauli rice. Both amazing. Loved the home baked cookies coming with the bill.</text>< pictures>

Stopped in for a beer, had very good sour on tap. Very good service at the bar and noticed the owner making rounds to make sure customers were happy. Don't see that every day. Food didn't really appeal to me as being anything special but noticed many regulars come in to order food while I was there.</review>

< Review>
Let’s set the premise: A cold Saturday evening, over 12 tables located outside, only two of them filled. The host and bar manager wouldn’t let me sit and have a drink while I waited for a friend to get dinner because they might “magically fill up.” You are apparently not allowed to have only a drink outside (all of which are $13+) - even when the inside bar is jam packed (that’s the only place you’re allowed to have a drink with no food).

Mind you I’m an attractive young woman as well, not some vagrant off the streets.

For how much I have supported this place (and always come here for “only a drink” -that’s just not how you treat a regular.

I’m now relocating my local bar to the Craftsman down the street.<//Review>

Awesome delicious place! We got a table outside and enjoyed the people watching. A lady with doggies passed by a couple of times and allowed her dogs to drink water off a little bowl which the resto set outside. Our waitress was quite nice and helpful. She did forget one small request, but then brought us cookies as a gesture for the oversight. The food was fantastic. I liked the Brussels Sprouts, Fries with honey mustard, lobster mini sandwiches, and curried shrimps. I can’t forget the drinks, I think I had 6 of them. Overall we had a great time and I can’t wait to go back once I return to LA!<//review>

<review>Favorite place for dates! Great food, drinks, and service. I wish they allowed reservations on OpenTable or something, but if you're a small party, you should be seated almost immediately, even on Saturday night. It get crowded at the bar. Which is nice<//review></record>

Absolute perfection! The service was on point, Courtney was fantastic! Also, this has never happened to me before, anywhere; The person delivering our food noticed our table was a bit wobbly, we hadn’t. So she went and grabbed a little plastic wedge and got on the floor and fixed it. Wow. The atmosphere was perfect and the food was FIVE stars! I’m a foodie and I will be back here for sure!!!< /Text>

They had me at complimentary salted chocolate chip cookies.  The avocado toast with grapes and burrata was amazing too.  Heard the burgers rule.<//Text>

The drinks were great. The bartenders were attentive and the atmosphere was on point. The Spicy shrimp was good, it needed to be more spicy though, other than that, they were great.They were also very knowledgeable about Whiskey options.<//Text>

<Review>Just a fantastic experience. Waitress was helpful, quick, and friendly. Food was great (the ahi tuna sandwich was one of the best I've had). And the atmosphere was good for a date with my wife. Comfortable seating, and music that wasn't too loud so we could hear each other.< /Review></record>

<text>Rambling place that’s so reminiscent of a larger French bistro or an old bank-turned-cafe. The historic charm (whether real or manufactured) was quite nice late at night as an alternative to so many other area bars. BUT it is quite noisy so a bit difficult to talk with the friends that I was with and the food was solid but not GREAT.</text>< Response>

Wicked place for lunch with deals for $5 along with a complementary cookie after your meal. In order to get the lunch deal, you have to sit at the bar. I recommend going before 1PM to get a bar space. Love Tuesday's!<//text>

This was my anniversary dinner and I was so happy with everything. My favorite dish was the ceviche. It was mouthwatering when it was placed right in front of me and when I took the first bite I knew I was going to finish it all by myself hahaha.

Very classy.... everything is wonderful.  Specialty cocktails are on point. The food is five stars. But the service isn't as elite.  This world be the perfect example of a 4.5 star engagement. Jusr go you'll love it.</review>

The food was great, but mistimed. My food was delivered really early and was lukewarm by the time my boyfriend's arrived. Was a little disappointed for a weekday evening.  I hope the service issue is smoothed out; will be a wonderful place if they do.<//review>

Had a dinner here. The staff were friendly and attentive while the prices were reasonable. The decor of the place is great, it is like a mansion library. Looking behind the bar is something I'd wish I had somewhere in my house. The food was good but the best was the cookies they offered after. The BEST cookie i've ever had. Chocolate chip with some sea salt, my mouth is watering as I'm typing this.</text>

<Text>We stopped in here for lunch and had a pretty good time. Good cocktails and lunch.  Be forewarned, the side of fries is huge! Very tasty though. Cocktails are pricey but it's a nice place so we expected as much. Waitstaff were great folks.</Text>< rate>

<Text>I like this place and menu but I feel taken when they add 3% to the bill for what they say is for the hardworking kitchen staff. I would say to the owners to either raise prices a touch to properly compensate your workers or lower the prices to compensate for the 3%. It’s insulting to the guest. The music volume could be lowered as well otherwise this is a fun restaurant with good food.<//Text>< user_id>

<Text>Can be loud but it’s a fun lively place. Good for a first date. If like fancy artisan cocktails they have those funny guys with the mustaches making the concoctions. The burger is amazing and so are the fries.  We had a problem with the kitchen not getting all of our orders but the staff was willing to take off the late food because of the inconvenience. Totally understood out frustration and were kind to fix the error.<//Text>< pictures>

The staff tries to work together yet very unorganized. As for the quality of food - zero stars. I ordered wings, there wasn't any chicken to pull off the bone. It's hard to mess up wings but they did it. The yellowtail was gross.
Maybe a good spot for drinks. I'd stay away from the food.</Review>

One of my favourite bars in Santa Monica. The decor and style is very pretty and cosy. The main bar is made of an old wooden book shelf and looks like a library but contains liquors instead of books. The barkeepers are very friendly and dressed up in white button downs and ties. They have good cocktails and decent food.
They have a happy hour from 12-7 pm with assorted cocktails for $7. The interior is darkish/red with lots of wood so good for a date. However, it u usually very crowded and also loud due to the amount of people. Plus is the outdoor seating.</review>

<Review>Beyond excellent food! Stopped by for dinner and woke up thinking about how awesome dinner was. Scallops appetizer are a must try - they come on a bed of ice, perfectly seasoned and are essentially ceviche. Salmon was perfect and so was the chicken. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a place to eat in the area! Great bar also! Bar service needs some work though.<//Review><username>Anna< /username>< Resp>

A great dining experience (as usual) at this restaurant...I highly suggest the brussel sprouts and veggie "burger." I love the cozy, sexy atmosphere of this restaurant and they have a great selection of wine and beer. I find it a bit loud in there sometimes, but so worth it. I always try to make it a point to stop in to this place when I am in Santa Monica. The surprise at the end is always so good too. If you're in Santa Monica and you're hungry, go eat here.<//review>

Great classy escape from the storm of tourists on Third Street Promenade, and surprise, it has the best daily happy hour in Santa Monica (12-7pm $7.50 for cocktails, and many other drinks). There's a catch though, it's very difficult to get a seat at pique hours, and forget about it if you don't like waiting on a Friday or Saturday. Very good cocktails—the Clocktower Manhattan recently left the menu, but it was one of the best Manhattans in LA. The gastropub style food menu is quite good as well. It's a great spot to stop with a notebook and do some writing, or for a quiet conversation. The atmosphere is sophisticated, and despite the heavy amount of tourists and obnoxious characters trying to impress dates, there's usually a good mix of locals too. Misfit feels like a slice of New York or Chicago that somehow found it's way to the beachfront of the Pacific.<//text>

The place was very nice a little cozy but big enough that you do not feel to crowded. The drinks were very good and I enjoyed the rib sliders. I also had the crispy chicken sandwich but I didnt like it. The sauce was a little to off for me but my partner liked it and finished it. Overall a good experience our waitress wasnt the best but not to bad as to leave a bad review about her.</review>

I dine out quite often. I also enjoy fine dining. The meal I had at the misfit is either the best meal I've ever had or the greatest dream. Every single dish was stupendous and full of flavor. I cannot more highly recommend a place.</text>

<Text>Came out to The Misfit for a girls night/birthday outing. Loved the atmosphere - warm, low lighting with dark wood and large stuffed chairs. The food was tasty and the service was great. I thought the food was a little more adventurous than I normally like but I still found a few things that I liked.

The pricing was spot on with the other reviews - mid range/$$. Also, go early or try for a reservation.  We went out on a Wednesday evening at 6:00 PM and there were plenty of people there when we arrived and some standing outside for table when we left. The bar had people lined up all evening.</Text><Resp>None</Resp><user_name>Michelle</user_name>< gmapID>

One of my favorite restaurants in LA. The service is always incredible. Everyone is always friendly. The food is always incredible. If you like to drink, this is one of the best places in the area for cocktails. The decor and ambience is nice. Very casual. Also, free cookies (and they're really good). Can't go wrong going here.<//review>

So my bf and I came to Cali from Alaska and this is hands down the BEST restaurant weve been too. We stopped by here on the way out to Vegas and this place just spook to us. The cocktails are so delicious and the food is fantastic. Service was great too. We'll definitely be back soon.</Review>

<Review>Incredible brussels sprouts and fried chicken sandwich! They have fun daily happy hours. Great ambiance with sophisticated cocktails. This place is really good, the only drawback is that it's so good the wait is usually 30-45 minutes. However, they'll text you when the table is ready so you can always wander around 3rd street or get a drink at the bar.</Review><Name>Carolina Morales< /Name></record>

Came here on a Monday night around 7:30. It was very quiet. Cute interior with fun floral wallpaper. As a corner restaurant there must be tons of light during the day.

We started with the burrata and tomatoes as well as the Brussel chips. The Burrata was perfectly creamy and the baby tomatoes were ripe and fresh. I would have preferred if it had been served with crostini or a crispy bread as it was all soft textures.</text>

<review>I cannot praise the quality of their cocktails enough. Whenever my wife and I happen to be in Santa Monica, it's must we stop here. The Goodnight Emily is out of this world. The only downside, is finding an open seat at the bar. Otherwise, it's a phenomenal place, fantastic ambiance, superb drinks. I highly recommend it.</review>< pictures>

<Text>This place has got great ambience and good cocktails - but, the food is pretty mediocre and mostly bland. Service also not fantastic - runners throw dishes down without explanation or interaction. Recommended for drinks, but skip the food and go to any of the other much better options in the area.< /Text><Time>1551657464491< /Time><user_name>Virginia Patrone<//user_name>< response>

I've never had Brussels sprouts like this before, and my boyfriend usually refuses to eat them, but he literally loved these. Their Baked Macaroni and Cheese was so scrumptious, and their French fries were also absolutely delicious. We also had the Misfit Burger, Medium Rare, and it was so perfect, and even comes with an (optional) egg on top. The whole ambiance of this place is excellent, it has dim lighting, pretty mirrors, books lining the walls, and other really nice, comfortable decoration.

The place has a great interior decor and furniture. Staff is friendly and helpful, our server was absolutely amazing. Food was spectacular! Roast beef sandwich was good, chicken sandwitch was really good I recommend it if you eat fried food, the spicy chicken was also great it is like a schnitzel but thicker the sauce that came with it had a good sting to it I really enjoyed it. Prices are average for this part of LA.</review>

Great food, with equally good cocktails. Misfit often has a line waitin at peak times. If you're there for brunch, I highly suggest trying the avocado toast. Your inner millennial will appreciate it as it is one of the tastiest in LA.< /text>< pics>

The Misfit Restaurant has a trendy, delicious lunchtime Happy Hour right by the Third Street Promenade. Excellent, friendly customer service.

Favorite menu items include the charred Brussels sprouts and steak sliders. Come early so you can get a high-top seat on the patio.

Pro Tip:
- Save room for the free cookie dessert
- Arrive early for a seat at the bar for the lunchtime Happy Hour</review>

<Text>Overall enjoyed my experience and food. Food was the highlight of the night! The chicken sandwich and shrimp are unreal... the service however.... could use a little bit of work... my group and I are from out of town and have never been treated in such a way. The staff around us were great but our server was a big let down. Drinks were subpar nothing too too crazy.</Text>< Response>

I’m not sure why everyone is impressed with the service here. I sat at the bar and was pretty much ignored for at least 10 minutes. How do you ignore someone at the bar? Ask Misfit. When I finally caught the attention of a bartender, there were no pleasantries, he just took my drink order and removed the menu even though I had initially planned on having dinner. Since it didn’t seem like my business was wanted, I left after my drink and went over to the next street to Uovo where I also sat at the bar and was served water immediately and my order taken in the first 5 minutes without any effort on my part. Very disappointing experience here given the raving reviews and high rating. Also, my cocktail was just alright - definitely have had better.<//Text>

We were seated as soon we arrived with no reservation. Service was fast and food was delivered at a reasonable time. Crispy chicken was tender but it's a BIG proportion. The ambiance of the restaurant is nice. Music is quite loud so it's hard to have a conversation. Overall, the place is a great place hang out and dinner. Happy hour only applies to drinks. Food is NOT a happy hour price.< /Text>

Will not go back and don't recommend visiting.  Menu needs to change and the waitress we got needs to be trained for sure.  Also, I noticed some food, I believe they may have been cookies or some dessert, just laying unattended and open on top of a counter that looked like trash.  The host was very nice though.</text><userid>106124304660229592913< /userid>< user_name>

Architecturally, this place is amazing! High ceilings - like two or three stories tall. Huge antique mirrors. Floor to ceiling bookcases used by the bar for bottles. The food is eclectic and tasty. Everything from tuna appetizers, fried brussel sprouts, fried chicken sandwiches, and burgers.< /Text>

<Text>Couple years ago. Took handicapped relative in wheel chair in with me. It was very crowded. Once there I asked host how long of a wait. The host said it was a long wait. I said "Just a second, I'm just moving my relative out of the way for other people to get out". I moved them few feet out of way. The host must not have heard me. I came back they said you didn't listen to me. I'm kicking you both out. I couldn't  believe it. Very rude and bias. If I didn't know better I would thing they were profiling people getting in. I had been there 2 times before and had a good time. Food great horrible front host staff.</Text><gmapID>0x80c2a4cfdd9c475f:0xa23e8d365323987<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<time>1519574864624</time><Text>We were promptly seated. As we're walking to our table you can sense the energy and great vibe of the place. Hubby and I shared three dishes and we enjoyed ALL of them. The cauliflower fried rice and roasted sweet potatoes were VERY generous portions and the Misfit burger was perfectly cooked. If I were to choose I'd say that the sweet potatoes were our favorite and I highly recommend you try them.

The service was a perfect balance of being attentive and also giving us space.

We look forward to coming back next time we're in Santa Monica.<//Text>< Name>

Huge place, good vibes, food is good too.

I wish they didn’t make the seating process so difficult with a lack of reservations, but they’re not alone in doing this. It makes having a business meal here hard (which is ironic because it’s going to be a big bill). However, the staff is really kind and overall had a good experience.< /text>

<review>Staff is very cool but prices are way to high compared to the food quality. Ordered their burger and it was dry, small and had no taste. Furthermore it did not come with any fries or salad..

Disappointing compared to price. 16$ for a small burger that have no taste and old tomato and overload of onion is simply not worth it.< /review>< Pictures>

Looks like I might be getting stood up at this place, but I don't even care because this place is fantastic.

Great ambience (noticing Tame Impala heavy rotation among other tasty jams). Their Golden Boy cocktail is 👍👍👍. The staff are friendly and wonderful.

Clean, classy, and cool.

Now between you, me, and this second Golden Boy cocktail I just ordered, I like to think myself something of a spaghetti squash connoisseur. Take me at my word, then, that you will not find a better spaghetti squash. It would be a disservice to challenge you to find one, because it would be a disrespect of your time. Don't waste your time just order the spaghetti squash and everything will be great. You'll forget all about your nagging desires for romantic intimacy and your perceived inability to materialize—let alone maintain—a healthy relationship. Italian pepper, capers, pepitas, currants, and sweet sherry vinegar > a girlfriend. You'll see what I'm saying if you try it.

Honestly I wouldn't mind getting stood up here again. 10/10 would recommend getting stood up at this dope af place.

Oh. I just received a chocolate chip and sea salt cookie as a consolation prize. Definitely getting stood up here again.< /Text>

Great food with a variety of shareable delictable delights.  Food is fantastic, service is friendly yet superb, and your food arrives FAST. Not the place for a quiet conversation - but it's in the middle of all the downtown action.< /text>

<user_name>Yael Davidowitz-Neu<//user_name><Resp>None<//Resp><review>Best thing is undoubtedly the free sea salt chocolate chip cookies at the end and I love the atmosphere and decor. Everything else needs work. I went with a party of 8 at lunchtime and all of our main courses came out at different times - no one asked us if we'd prefer them staggered and it was awkward as some people had hot dishes and didn't feel comfortable eating them. For shared appetizers, we had to request a utensil each time - this place is busy at lunch, always, and I feel like not quite set up to accomodate it.

Food wise, I tried a few things. Veggie burger was great. Brussel sprouts were not bad. Beet hummus looked and tasted like mustard, not at all like hummus, and came with a weird medley of pickled vegetables. Lentil soup and kale salad were both bland and the soup came out lukewarm.<//review>< gmap_id>

This is a pretty typical yuppie bar. We went for happy hour and it was very crowded. I can't recommend the beet hummus - who else gives you whole green onions for crudities? - and the hummus was just a smear.< /Text>

Oh. so so so so so good!
It was walking distance from the hotel so when I saw the fabulous rating with over 3000 reviews I knew we needed to go. Went for dinner last night. Our waiter was adorable and VERY good about helping us make selections, and then making us feel good about everything we choose.
They have a great selection of local beers, I can't remember what the one I choose was called - I remember it had the name 'magical and delicious' in it and that's pretty much why I ordered it!
We got the baba ganoush, crab & corn fritters, the mac & cheese, shrimp diablo, chicken sausage skewer, and the short rib skewers.
Oh. Em. Gee. EVERYTHING was simply marvelous. Cooked to perfection, sauces all delicious and paired perfectly with each dish. I don't know that I had a favorite - the short rib was my favorite of the skewers and the shrimp diablo was my least favorite of the small plates (but not by much, so don't overlook it based on that).
At the end of the meal you get a chocolate sea salt cookie that is SO good you want to grab the bowl and make a run for it out the door (but don't, that's just rude - instead ask your waiter to purchase some to take home with you)
The decor is so fun - it's in the 1929 clock tower building and the decor totally gives you that vibe. The bar is the focal point and there is SO much to see in it. I almost wish they weren't as busy as they were so that I could have gone up and checked it out closer - but busy is good so I'd never wish a business NOT have clients. :)

If I am in the area again this is DEFINITELY going to be a repeat visit!!< /Text>

Want a great tasting burger? Then order their Misfit Burger.  Bring a friend, a date, and have them order their Crispy Chicken Sandwich, oh yeah! They have a nice selection of beer and they make some fine cocktails. If Rum moved you try their Wink and a Nod....very good. You will find it hard to have nothing but a great time.</review>

High quality good food! The cocktails were really refreshing! Everything is made there so it's super fresh. Happy hour drinks were only $6 👌🏻👌🏻

Food is interesting and unique. The brussel sprouts were good. The burger was good but not worth $16 in my opinion. I go there for the ambience and the drinks ...but for me it's a bit too pricey. I guess my palette isn't that sophisticated.</Text>

<Text>Great atmosphere, good food...actually the carrots were amazing and the chicken sandwich was really good. Only drawback was an off menu drink suggested by our waiter in response to requesting something they didn't have. My mescal cocktail was also dope, so maybe just stick to the drink menu...< /Text>< Date>

The Mac&Cheese w/ Fresh Ground Chirzo was Amazing!! I've had M&C all over the country but there's nothing like it! On the flip side the lighting is really low so its hard to read menu's and I'm not a fan of there's no free refills but on Lemonade. For me it was to much pulp. It would be nice to have fresh Low/No Pulp option.< /review>

<Text>This restaurant was great, we were going to Cut but decided last minute to come here and it was the best possible decision. The food was delicious, the service was fantastic, and the restaurant had a hip atmosphere without being pretentious. There was only one dish we didn't like and our waitress Hannah was kind enough to refund it. We also got a sweet snack at the end. Would definitely recommend.<//Text><Resp>None</Resp></record>

Awful.  A limited, overpriced menu that yields questionable (at best) food, trying to be hip and cool and artsy - but it is only FARTSY.  The service was decent, and my biggest complaint was price.  Next was what I got for that price - I would have expected something of higher quality or something that required at least a but of skill; something to make me raise an eyebrow, and got neither.  Not HORRIBLE, but not good.  Skip it and move to the next she-she joint.  This one should be a PASS.<//review>

Food is very good, little greasy but good. We enjoyed the ambiance until service, too slow.  Some of the waiters/waitresses were standing around and chatting instead of serving.  Took 20 min. to bring out 6 glasses of water and 40 min. for food.  Had to chase them down for check.</review>

I’ve been to this restaurant multiple times to know that the food is pretty good. If you are planning to visit this place and don’t want to deal with wait times, try visiting it during the week in the afternoon(lunch). This place gets REALLY busy on Saturday night. If you go with a large group be prepared to wait a while. They do not do reservations so you will have to wait. They do have a bar area where you can wait until your party is texted, but that area does get very full. I gave it four stars because when it is really busy on the weekends the service and food quality tend to go down a bit. I’d recommend going here for lunch and possibly dinner during the business week, not on weekends if you want to eat right away. Otherwise, it’s a nice establishment.<//review>

Dropped in to grab a drink and some apps with friends. The brussel sprouts were great (with apples and Greek yogurt), and I loved the french fries. Great drink selections - with good prices if you make it for happy hour before 7pm, and complimentary sea salt chocolate chip cookies at the end of the meal.<//review>

Upon his bite into the BBQ Salmon, my friend zealously exclaimed that this was the best plate of salmon he ever had. It was a little exaggerated, but very much a testament to their food.

The only big miss was the cauliflower fried rice - quite tasteless.

Coupled with a great ambiance and excellent bar staff, this restaurant is must-try if you're in the area.</Text>

< Review>
Had brunch here today and it was one of the best meals I've had in years.            Friendly & welcoming staff. Sangria was on POINT. Everything is shareable, so we started with the heirloom tomato & melon salad. Light & refreshing - perfect palette wetter. Then we tried the Lobster Nik Nik - mini lobster roll sliders on King's Hawaii'n Bread was magnificent. Then tried the Chilaquiles and was totally impressed - a modern take on a mexican classic.  My dad had the burger and it looked spectacular.   Restaurant was busy, but you could still here each other.< /Review>

It’s been a while since I’ve been thoroughly impressed by the quality of the service, the speed of the food & drinks, and the taste of the food. Misfits has hit them all. Highly recommended! :)< /text>

Very decent restaurant and bar but nothing particularly stand out or great. We had a variety of the shareables, which were all reasonably sized, including the diablo shrimp and salmon ceviche. They were all good but not great.<//review>

Thought about review for a day or so. I really only give food 3 stars. Nothing special, good, the fries looked like someone ran down and got a big order from Steak and Shake and replated them. The portions were large and tasted fine.
I give them 2 bonus stars for service and being very dog friendly. Waitress took good care of us on the crowded busy patio. Our dog was welcome and the staff brought him water and snacks.
Prices matched location, high but it's what one would expect in the area.
Overall a good experience.< /text>

Burger was fine, there fries where ok, there fresh ahi Burger was nothing to write home about, but not bad either. Did not like how the waitress acted how we should know the place, but then offered complementary cookies with our coffee. A lot of near misses with ok food.

Decent cocktails.  Food was good, not exceptional.  Staff was courteous, but not exactly warm or welcoming.  It's better than most of the options in the area, but otherwise it's on par with a generic upscale bar you can find anywhere else in LA.<//text>

This is one of my favorite spots for dinner and drinks when I'm around 3rd street Santa Monica area. It has a unique atmosphere that is great for casual hangout with friends or a dinner date.

Favorite Foods & Drinks:
-Shrimp Ceviche (Baja style)

-Hand Cut Kennebec Fries (Huge serving bowl full of shoestring fries, easily feeds 4 people)

-The Misfit Burger (Classic & simple with cheddar, mayo, and house pickles)

-Crispy Chicken Sandwich (Jidori chicken, fennel slaw, and spicy mayo) *Favorite Dish*

-Pitcher of White Sangria (Easily serves 4 people)

-At the end of the meal they give you a free salted chocolate chip cookie!

And if you go during weekday lunch they have a "Bar Fly Lunch" menu if you sit at the bar. $5 lunch special of the day that changes every day.

With $5 offerings like their Saigon Crispy Chicken, The Misfit Burger, The Ahi Burger, etc you really can't go wrong!<//Text>

The happy drinks were good and the ambiance was great. The food we did have was delicious but for me I love all the options on the menu, when I think American (new) for cuisine i want some classics redone and they have some of that but not what I would expect. The service was really good for us and we had a party of 6. Overall I would recommend<//review>

<text>My girlfriend and I visited LA for the weekend and this place was highly sought after on google reviews and with the locals. They were right. The bartenders are over the top mix masters. My girlfriend told the bartender what she liked and he created a drink for her palate. The food is just ridiculously amazing. Broccoli is delicious with just enough spice. Cauliflower curry is a must for curry lovers. The tuna is super fresh. They use a really high quality grass fed ground beef (best beef I've ever had) for all their burgers... Definitely recommend trying the Green chile burger.

We went here our first evening in LA and were so impressed we came back the next night. The second night we had a dish that we didn't like. Not only did the server remove it from our tab and replace the dish, the manager personally came over to apologize and handed us a $50 voucher for our next visit. Next time we're in LA we will definitely come back here. This is what all restaurants should strive to become.</text><username>Utopia Entertainment< /username><date>1455382790562<//date>< Pictures>

<Text>An upscale restaurant with amazing food and drinks. They have both indoor and outdoor seating.  Service was great, prices are a bit higher but you are paying for the ambiance, service and quality of food.  We ordered the Misfit burger, crispy brussel sprouts and shredded kale and quinoa salad.  I recommend to try all of them!!! And if you have been reading the prior reviews, don't forget to grab your salted chocolate chip cookie before you leave, it's super yum!< /Text>< Pictures>

<Rating>4<//Rating><Review>The food at Mistfit changes periodically and never disappoints. Love the salads and the lobster roll sliders. Brunch is excellent and there is an extended happy hour. Great craft cocktails-- they make several with grapefruit that are the best on the patio on a nice day. Also love the complimentary chocolate chip cookies with sea salt at the end of the meal. I have purchased additional packages of them for visiting guests. Only downside is that it can be very difficult to hear and have a conversation inside and at the bar on the evenings it's very crowded--no place to stand and people constantly elbowing and pushing you. Patio is great though.< /Review>< pics>

Nice vegan and vegetarian snacks. Pleasant, dog-friendly outdoor area in the front but can get cold and windy. The Misfit Cocktail is a fascinating barrel-aged gin drink. Also enjoyed the Goodnight Emilie, a more traditional gin-grapefruit-mint combo. Oh, and try the kimchi fried rice. Great happy drink deal.<//Text>

One of my favorite spots as a local! Everything is delicious but my favorites are - Food: Bacon wrapped dates, crispy chicken sandwich, and the baked mac+cheese Drink: Basil Gimlet. They accommodate for vegan, vegetarian, and gluten free.

Always a good looking crowd and has an awesome Happy Hour! The only point against it is that it can get really noisy if you sit indoors which makes you feel like you're yelling across the table the whole time.</review>

Food was amazing! We got complementary sea salt chocolate chip cookies that were incredible at the end. Our waitress was so nice and sweet. Such a good experience.< /Review>

Went here for birthday dinner. Very creative items on the menu that taste better than expected. Really nice ambiance. The music however got louder as the crowd grew. Not sure if that was intentional, but felt unnecessary.</Text>

<Review>The food was excellent. They have beautiful decor and take full advantage of the oldest building in Santa Monica. Come for the barfly lunch specials and stay for the atmosphere. The servers are all attentive and knowledgeable. And you must try the olive oil sea salt gelato.< /Review></record>

<text>Great customer service! Our waitress was very friendly and had a wonderful attitude. I think her name was Jessica. We were a party of six and were fortunate to have a table on the second floor near the kitchen. We were told we would have to be done by a certain time due to a reservation later that night. Food came out in a timely manner. Though the prices of the entrees might be slightly high, the quality of the food does match up with it. Highly recommend trying this restaurant.</text></record>

They also give you a chocolate chip cookie after your meal.. for free!</review>

<text>Service at the bar was excellent but the menu wasn’t fully explained to us and the food service was very poor. Our empty plates and drinks were left for ages and the wrong bill was brought to us at the end of our meal. It took the waitress 15 minutes to rectify the bill and we weren’t asked if we wanted to order anymore drinks.< /text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

Great food reasonably priced with an awesome look and feel. Super conveniently located if you work in dtsm.

If you're in a hurry for lunch on any week day or want to connect with a friend over a meal, I'd highly recommend sitting at the bar and ordering from their bar-fly menu. It changes every day of the week and is both healthy and filling for $6! Unbeatable in this area of LA.<//text>

<review>The best thing about this place (aside from their complimentary and addicting salted chocolate chip cookies) is their lunch special: a select signature menu item for $5 and $6 cocktails.

<pics>None</pics><text>Absolutely my favorite date night spot - amazing speakeasy ambiance and upscale but still affordable food.  The waitstaff is great and very friendly and the mood is always light.  Their menu is structured similarly to tapas, but the serving sizes are about double that for their entrees.  Everything is fresh and delicious, and they cycle dishes through the menu frequently.

Their mixed drinks are fantastic, and we love to get their sangria pitcher - it's only $20 and a great deal for a night out.  They finish each meal with free, warm, salted chocolate chip cookies which are the best part!  The only negative is that the tables are pretty close together so the whole restaurant gets pretty loud, but overall it's a great choice.<//text><userid>102075488447917046515< /userid>< Name>

Very interesting restaurant/bar.  It had very prohibition type theme to it.  The gentleman bartenders wear a classy tux and tie, and the ladies are in jeans and a black button up.  Very friendly staff.  The food was really good.  French fries come with both ketchup and a honey dijon mustard dipping sauce.  The chicken sandwich had just enough spice to it, making it very enjoyable.</review>

Gluten free Mac and cheese was fantastic. Hamburger is excellent as well.. Rapid seating and service. Dining outside during the pandemic both in front of the restaurant and to the south.</review>

<Review>I enjoyed the beer and happy hour. I ordered the avocado toast which had good flavors but the tomatoes kept falling off what quickly became soggy toast. Still enjoyable just a little difficult to eat.<//Review><Time>1520294747331< /Time><gmapID>0x80c2a4cfdd9c475f:0xa23e8d365323987< /gmapID>< Name>

Great spot to hang and people watch, make sure to get there early to get a spot otherwise the bar stacks pretty deep!  Great food and drinks, and the outside sidewalk is a sure crowd pleaser.<//Review>

<review>Creative takes on classic gastropub foods and a good selection of interesting cocktails. Usually not too busy. Atmosphere is bustling but the volume can get quite loud. On the house sea salt cookies are a nice treat. Try Ingos if you want a quieter evening.<//review>< gmap_id>

<Review>A little loud. But I dig the atmosphere. Drank a basil gimlet, yummy! Tried the ceviche, which was perfect, it just needs some tostada chips or something crunchy to eat with it. Also tried the fried chicken sandwich, which was good, except the bread sort of fell apart. Loved the house made cookie served before we left.  Overall a good experience.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

<date>1513364886968</date><rate>2< /rate><review>I love this restaurant have gone quite a few times in fact. But one of the most recent ventures went with the misses we had the oysters (the only meal we had shared that day couldn’t have been anything else) and both got sick that night. We called the next day spoke to Katie the manager. She said she’d take care of this and we’d both get calls from a few people. Week goes by nothing call her again she tells me we will receive calls. 3 more weeks go by nothing call again same story. This issue still has not been resolved. If the issue was resolved 5 stars easy! But due to the carelessness I am leaving this review.< /review>< Pictures>

WOW. Honestly at a loss for words, not only is the food absolutely delicious but the service is on point and the operations here are incredibly professional and efficient. I enjoyed the baked mac n cheese...I've eaten Mac n cheese all over this country and let me be the first to say (probably not the first to say) but this dish was absolutely delectable. I'd 10/10 recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for great ambiance, with a sophisticated taste just looking for a good overall experience. Will be back, that's for sure!< /text>

Beautiful building, with fantastic customer service. Was underwhelmed by the food. I had Mac & cheese with chorizo. Chorizo was a bit overcooked. Partners bakes zucchini was described as being one endless flavor and got boring fast. 4 stars for the overall experience.<//Review>

I ended up at the misfit since the wait at sugarfish was taking over an hour so I walked around the corner to try the misfit. The food was fine but nothing noteworthy. They have a full bar with a nice decor that is cozy and intimate. We shared the scallop appetizer which came out ceviche style. We split the spicy chicken entre since they warned us it was plenty of meat. It was plenty of food but again the flavor and execution of the food was very forgettable.<//review>

Great happy hour from 4-6 daily! Wonderful environment and really great drinks for just $6. I got the basil gimlet and had to stop myself from ordering a third. So good and they don't skimp on the alcohol! If only ordering drinks, you have to sit at the bar and seats run out quick during happy hour so get there as close to 4 as possible. Also ask for the cookies!! They are complimentary but not advertised and they are amazing!</review>

This is the best burger I have ever eaten. That may seem like hyperbole, but I assure you it is not. When the menu recommends ordering it rare to medium rare, trust it. The staff was attentive, the service was prompt, and the whisky caramel gelato was delightful.</text>

My favorite was the Misfit Cocktail.  It tastes like an old fashioned, with a slight variation.  For lunch, the Misfit Burger was also a winner.  It was juicy and messy, and tasty.  Walking by, you notice a good vibe on both the inside and the outside.  These features have made it a must try fixture of the 3rd street promenade.</Text>< Pics>

Went here for the first time last night with some friends, after a quick google search, interior looked cool. Couldnt stop thinking about how perfect the service was. Really felt taken care of and they even had Paper Plane cocktails and Angels envy Rye! We got there and the front host Taylor (I think?) put us on the waitlist so we decided to grab drinks at the bar. Bar was kinda crazy but we quickly got serviced. Apparently i was texted that the table was ready but Taylor went out of his way to find us and sat us down. We got a cool view of the bar, center of the room. Food selection was decent and it got to us pretty fast! Prices on food is great, drink prices are fair, honestly though customer service goes a long way and I’ll definitely come back!</text>

Amazing food with tons of vegetarian options. The service was great as well along with the atmosphere . Would recommend to anyone passing through Santa Monica that wants something a little healthier and tastier than the pier vendors a couple blocks away.</Text>

<review>One of the best kept secrets in Santa Monica By the locals. Many tourists pass it by without a second glance because the outside is nothing like the inside. Beautiful interior, with pisters, paintings and carved woods. Floor to ceiling bar area and the bartenders know mixology.  Great food and better atmosphere. Super place to meet people, professional staff assures great service and the bartender knows when not to interrupt a conversation!< /review><resp>None< /resp>< Time>

This gets my lowest rating available in Google review. Service is horrible, waiter looks like he got his hands full on other tables. Lobster and prime rib burger are great but price doesn't justify the overall dining experience.< /review>

Yes the pricing is in about that rang but two portions is that of a normal restaurant in my opinion. so in reality great food not quantity at that pricing though. Second off id recommend a time of day or week where the tourism isn't as high as it an become somewhat of a pretentious scene being placed next to equinox and lululemon what else is there to expect. Great staff, great food, self serving customers, people watching is on point. Oh and go with the sliders all day they are delicious</Review><Rating>4<//Rating>< Response>

Nice vibe. Very few seats outside unfortunately.  Prime rib sandwich was not as good as people claimed in other reviews. They should try Houston's prime rib... Chicken sandwich was barely average... Sorry disappointed..</Text>

<review>The food was fine, nothing special, but the service was awful. Our server was very rude and seemed unhappy to be there. I don’t recommend this place if you’re in Santa Monica.

I was here with a friend after work, it was our first and only visit. When our server came around she asked if we were familiar with the restaurant, we of course said no. The server  just stared at us blankly until my friend politely asked if she had any recommendations for us, she said she wasn’t sure what we’d like. We told her we didn’t have any dietary restrictions and that we were open to try anything, again she just stared at us.

It wasn’t particularly busy or loud in there so it’s not like she couldn’t hear us.

Anyway this happens again with the wine, I got frustrated and just went with the sparkling rosé. She brings me the regular still rosé. No explanation, no apology. I didn’t even say anything. My friend’s order was messed up, he asked for no tomato, he got tomato. The server claims we never told her and seemed deeply bothered about it, homegirl we said no tomato.

Halfway through our meal we were out of wine and we were out of water, she never again stopped by our table. She scanned her section but didn’t approach any tables the whole time we were there, unless she was bringing plates out. Even when she finally brought out the check it took her forever to charge us.

My friend and I left there annoyed and frustrated with the experience. We don’t mind spending money on food, especially when you’re one of the only restaurants in SaMo that’s open late, but considering the quality of service we should’ve just gone to a 24hr McDonalds drive thru and cracked open a bottle of wine at home, it would’ve been cheaper and at least they get our order right.< /review>< pics>

<rating>1< /rating><Text>My friends and I were looking for a nice place in Santa Monica for good cocktails and a nice ambiance. Online reviews told us the Misfit was the place;  and it looked it until we actually wanted to order.

As a person who has visited many establishments in many locations, I've seen a lot. I have never had a team of bartenders be so rude, pretentious, and make customers (other people at the bar included) wait so long for a drink, a check, or otherwise.

When it came time to close out the check, I had to wait 25 minutes for my card. The bartenders were unapologetic and weren't shy in showing a disdainful attitude.

Safe to say that none of my friends (or the other people at the bar, for that matter, I assume) will return to the Misfit. Well-deserved name.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< GmapID>

LOVE the soup and salad option because they have delicious soups. The Avocado toast is also a must have. Everything is pretty delicious and they have a good happy hour.
This is one of my go to places for lunch and HH.< /Review>

Expect a long wait if you're coming with a group. The atmosphere is dark and hip and you definitely feel like you're in a bar in LA. I come here when I'm meeting a friend from out of town or I want to meet co-workers for Happy Hour. It can get loud so if you come with and want to hear everything their saying I would recommend the outdoor seating.</Text>< Pics>

The best thing on the menu is Mac and cheese. Cool trendy venue, good value in happy hour. A little pricy out of happy hour 👍</review>

<Review>In the heart of downtown Santa Monica, the Misfit Restaurant is always bursting with energy. It has an outdoor seating area and the place is always packed with people. It is also located on a busy street and is near third street promenade. It is surrounded by other restaurants and businesses in the area and there is an alleyway near the restaurant.< /Review><Date>1470349618079< /Date></record></dataset><record>

<review>A friend and I went just for drinks during happy hour and stood at the bar waiting 10 min to be helped before we asked the hostess to find us an actual table instead. The farm to table aspect is what intrigued us to try the food. We shared an appetizer - Brussel sprouts. I must say they were well made, with some dill creme fresh dipping sauce. The Brussel sprouts save this review from being one star; that and the service once seated was very quick. The beverage my friend ordered had far too much alcohol in it which made for lack of a balanced drink. My drink was watered down and lacked any taste. This made for a less than pleasant experience.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< gmapID>

I wasn't a fan of the food or portion sizes. It seems reasonably priced initially but by the time you get a complete meal, it was really expensive. Also, ask for details on what's included in a dish - I don't like onions and although onions aren't listed, there were onions in my choices.< /text>

This is one of my top three favorite restaurants in LA. The servers, hosts, and bartenders here are almost always the friendliest, most welcoming people. I literally dream about their french fries. Super skinny, perfectly seasoned with honey mustard dipping sauce. I feel tears forming in my eyes just thinking about them. Their mac and cheese is super yummy. I've also enjoyed some of their soups, their spicy fried chicken, and tons of other dishes. Almost everything on their menu is gluten free. Their cocktails are also delicious. Don't be intimidated if you see a line forming outside. They have a very efficient waitlist and will get ahold of you when you're up. But they're usually pretty quick. The bar is PACKED during happy hour, so we almost always just get a table and eat, too. Beautiful environment, as well. Mmmmmmmmm!<//Text>

<text>Loved this place. Great options on healthy and locally sourced products. Place is packed on the weekend nights, so make a reservation or prepare to wait for over an hour, good thing is that it's located in downtown Santa Monica, so there are a lot things to do around and kill some time while waiting for a table.< /text>< Pics>

<text>Caught up with a couple friends for dinner here, and I was pretty impressed.  The whole restaurant was filled with conversation, laughter, and people. We were seated right on time for our reservation, and the service was great.

The bacon wrapped dates, mac & cheese, and prime rib sliders were my favorites. Everything was delicious, and the custom drinks were awesome. They even finished us off with complimentary salted chocolate chip cookies (a whole stack of them!).

Will definitely be going back here agin soon.<//text>< Pictures>

<text>If I ever have reason to brave 3rd Street Promenade tourists this is the only reason to go here.   Daily lunch specials are a super deal and the historic interior gives it an ambiance rarely found elsewhere in Los Angeles.< /text>< user>

Had a misfit Burger, it was amazing! You must try it out. We have waited almost an hour to be seated as it was Friday evening and we had no reservation, but it was really convenient that they texted us when there was a free table for us.< /text>

Easily the best reasonably priced food and drinks in downtown Santa Monica. The $5 daily lunch special ensures that the bar counter is full from opening to closing. My favorite drink here is the Pimm's Cup.<//Text>

The Misfit Burger is quite good but absurdly small for the price. Even the iced tea comes in a tall half-a-glass! The staff was excellent. Will I go back? That's a definite maybe.<//Review>

<Review>I love MisFits they have an amazing! HH that goes all day until 7pm and all drinks on that HH menu are $7 😁😁. My favorite is the Golden Boy, although you wont find it on their menu anymore its still available. You wont regret ordering one or five 💪🏽💪🏽. Misfits also has these ridiculously addicting cookies that are complimentary🤪. They are chocolate chip and rock salt cookies .....AMAZING!!!! if your coming down make sure you get there before 4pm as the bar area gets extremely full and you cant sit at a table unless your ordering food.< /Review>< gmap_id>

OK burgers but only 1 TV for sports that OK only really viewable from the bar.

Also not a fan of the salty cookies they give out at the end.

Atmosphere is the only great part Misfits.</review>

I would eat here for every meal if I could. Well maybe not EVERY meal, but you know what I mean. Happy hour is the best and the cocktails are impeccable! The brussel sprout salad is amazing. I don't think I've ever had a meal here I didn't like. The only downside is it's always packed and they don't take reservations. It's not the worse though, there's plenty to keep you busy in the area while you wait.< /Text>

Great spot in Santa Monica that's closish to the beach. Reminds me of a place you'd see in NYC. Great for people watching and make sure to sit outside if the weather is on the warmer side.<//Review>

Great place we found randomly for lunch and a beer to cool off in Santa Monica. I enjoyed the Ahi burger and we shared a big bowel of brussel sprouts which were delicious.<//text>

Best all day, every day Happy Hour anywhere in Santa Monica or LA for that matter. Fantastic cocktail list and daily food specials at the bar. One of the best kitchens anywhere.  Try the Fiesta de Las Flores, an imaginative twist on the traditional margarita, or the Mezcal Yellowjacket for a spicier kick. Chicken sandwich is highly recommended.<//review>

Great staff, delicious california-style cuisine (asian influenced, lots of fresh produce). Happy hour cocktails are just $6 till 7pm! The only regret I have is that our neighbours had the mac and cheese and I wish we had ordered it as it looked amazing!<//review>

<review>the food here is incredible. The kitchen knows what they are doing. I had the salmon and the tuna as an ap. Mind blown. My friends had both burgers & they raved about it. They mentioned it was the best burger they have ever had. My third friend had the chicken sandwich. She liked it but it was piles too high.MaryYourSoul(dot)com< /review>< user>

Just found this place to be good and not great. The fried chicken is good but the drinks here are much better. Koo place to jave a bite and a beer!
This place is beautiful inside. Fell in love with the theme and the style/decor.
Customer service was great, no complaints what so ever.

Dinner:
I had the the AHI BURGER sushi grade tuna, hand ground and seared rare, avocado, spicy mayo on a bun. Which wasn't all that great. It was bland I didn't taste the spicy mayo and the avocado tasted over ripe, It had that crappy taste had to remove it from the burger.
My friend had the CRISPY CHICKEN SANDWICH with jidori chicken breast, fennel-apple slaw, spicy mayo. Now that was tasteful from the bite she let me have.
For me the best part was the side of fries that we ordered.
I can see how this is one of their popular dishes.

I do think the burgers are over priced for JUST the burger and some root vegetables that come a long with the burger.</review>

I feared to find an over hyped place, but the food was actually good, and the atmosphere very nice (if a bit noisy). The menu leads you to choose several dishes to share (read = expect a somewhat more expensive bill) but we had a good night here and would come again. Nice cocktails to go with the dishes - but I missed more traditional options here.<//text>

This is a 5-star happy hour place, but a 3 star restaurant when happy hour is not in effect so I gave it a solid four. $5 dollars for all of their signature cocktails sounds like a great deal to get buzzed at the Santa Monica pier. I would recommend most of the drinks except the Pimm's punch unless you want to have what seemed like a thimble size amount of alcohol. The food was ok, I got the 3 sliders combo and the slider were relatively small and overpriced. The prime rib slider was delicious though and their chocolate chip cookies aren't too bad. A little too much sea salt for my taste, but after 3 drinks it starts tasting even better.<//review>

<Review>I took my mom, niece, and nephews here for The Misfit Restaurant and we had a great time! Place just needs to be cleaner.  For instance, our table had a plastic menu stuck to the lazy susan and it wasn't intentional.  I can go on but I wont.  I mean is it that hard to operate a clean place?  It really imparts a sense of indifference that's kind of nasty if you break it all the way down to the food preparation.</Review>< rate>

<Name>Carlin Yuen</Name><text>Came here for dinner on a business trip. Really cool decor -- like an old school library mashed up with a classy bar with really high ceilings, but it totally works -- well designed and interesting. The lighting is dim but not straining, and it gets kinda loud in there.

It was pretty busy when we came in, and service was a little sparse but they were still pretty fast and friendly about it. Drinks are about $9 a pop for a well drink, and the food is all kinda tapas-like with some larger dishes as well.

Tried the prime rib French dip nik nik sliders, the bacon-wrapped dates, and the fried chicken sandwich. The dates were decent, although I think the bacon doesn't balance with the date as well as I thought it would. The french dip sliders were great: a little pricey for the amount you get, but the meat was soft and still tasty, and the dip worked pretty well.

My favorite by far was the fried chicken sandwich though. Big portion, plus a delicious mix of texture and flavor. There's a nice spicy kick to it, and the crispy crunch to the chicken worked really well with the marinade / sauces on it. Would definitely go back for that sandwich again!<//text>< Time>

Great happy hour even on the weekends. Free sea salt chocolate chip cookies too. Have had dinner here as well - fantastic mac and cheese, bacon wrapped dates and the prime rib French dip niks niks. Love the ambience here especially with the library/old English pub theme.<//review>

Great flavors, fantastic cocktails, and friendly staff give a great base, but expensive prices knock a star off.

Seriously, drop prices 25-30% and this would be 5 star no problem.<//text>

The tuna tataki starter was average, the Crispy Lobster Nik Nik tasted amazing. The burgers were juicy and tender - one of the best in the city. The helping sizes aren't great, so you might have to get by by ordering another burger. The service is prompt and the waiters were always around there. The Apple cider beer was amazing - you can't get by without ordering another one.< /Text>

<Rating>1< /Rating><Text>Decieved twice. After waiting 70 minutes for a 30-45 minutes table, was overcharged for an appetizer of three lonely scallops mascarading as a main, the smallest 25 dollar entree I have ever been served, so small that I had the try and fill the hunger void with greasy french files that someone else ordered. I was then was offered to choose something else after complaining to the waiter. I assumed and got the impression that I wouldn't have to pay, only to find both meals on the bill at the end. To top it all off my girlfriend found food on my pants and it turns out I was sitting on the bits of someone else's dinner. Very disappointed.<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

I am already dreaming of coming back here!  Food was awesome, service was awesome, and we even had some great people watching on the patio.

To start, I really enjoyed the cocktails.  There are so many to try.  We got several dishes to share which worked well.  The burrata with peaches was my favorite by far.  And the best part - free sea salt chocolate chip cookies!  Sooo good.

We went for a birthday dinner and it was a great spot for a special occasion.</review>

we stopped in here for a quick drink before a show in santa monica. a cool location, feels historic but not precious. good cocktail selection as well as beer and wine. the food looked good but we were just there for drinks. reasonably good crowd on an early saturday evening as well!<//Text>

I had the Mushroom Carbonara and my date had the Chickpea Wrap. Both were good but not particularly memorable. Moderately good restaurant relative to options in the area.</Text>

< review>
This place was great for quite some time until I discovered that they were overcharging me.  This was a bit of a big deal being that I would go there 4-6 times a week.  When I brought up the overcharge to a manager, they basically told me that I was out of luck.  Therefore, even though this place is incredibly convenient for me I will be inconvenienced in order to keep them from getting my money.  Yes, I'm bitter.  I worked in hospitality before and it wouldn't have been a big deal to them to make things right.  They've lost my weekly money as well as all of those meetings I could have had in their location.  Of course I tell others to avoid it also.<//review>

Very underwhelmed. There are far cooler places in Santa Monica. Service was also a bit of a shambles. We sat with our fries for 10 mins before the rest of the food came. I wouldn’t bother going here.</review>

For once the Zagat review does a good job of describing the dining experience.  Emphasis on attentive wait staff. We ordered with one waitress and our drinks arrived in what seemed like seconds later. Tip: order the bacon wrapped dates.   And for anyone heading out to the east coast, looking for a similar place, try Stoddards or Eastern Standard in Boston.< /Text>

Delicious food and priced fairly for gastropub(ish) food in Santa Monica off 3rd street. Portions are a decent size and who doesn't love 'free' cookies at the end!< /Text>

Was referred to this place by another bar that had already closed their kitchen. The ambience is great but the food is lackluster and overpriced and the service was subpar. I got the veggie burger which was difficult to eat. It comes on toast instead of a bun which cuts up your mouth and makes all the fixings of the burger slide off. My friend got the misfit burger which he said was "just ok". We got a plate of fries to share. The whole plate was filled with those fries everyone hates; super short and fried too hard like the fries you find at the bottom of your fast food bag. The server never refreshed our drinks and we had to stop another server to ask for our receipt after ours walked past our table about 5 times without stopping.<//text>

I've been to The Misfit over twenty times. It's the place we bring all our friends and family that visit. Slightly expensive when not happy hour, but we'll worthy the delicious menu and amazing atmosphere.</text>

<review>They had the best presentation I've seen for an Irish Whiskey. It was served in a wine glass with a side of french press! This is probably my favorite bar near 3rd st promenade, especially because they spoil you with their famous complimentary sea salt cookies :)

A bit crowded at the narrow lightly-dimmed bar on a Sunday night. We got lucky and found a good spot to sit. I ordered white sangria which was refreshing, nothing crazy amazing.

I liked their 1920-ish ambience a lot and the service was great.

::FOOD::
we ordered random stuff, all of them were pretty sweet...I couldn't taste the sweetness from my sangria because of that.
- bacon wrapped dates with goat cheese, nuts and topped with parmesan: delicious and rich, share it with people
- $3 pistachio gelato: not sure what the hype is all about, still yummy and rich
- complimentary sea salt cookie: the reason why people love them = BUTTER</review><userid>102191991550028128685</userid></record></dataset><record>

The food was good. We had the Avacado toast and Tuna Tataki that was amazing. We followed that with the Pan seared Filet Mignon and Crispy lobster Nik Nik and that was outstanding. The drinks were good. If we come back, we will definitely come back.< /text>

<Text>Beautiful atmosphere with lots of warm looking dark wood, mirrors, old fashioned iron fixtures and tile floors.  A little loud, though it struck me as VERY loud when we walked in it really didn't impede our conversation.  Food was good, not exceptional.  Service was a little slow, but friendly.</Text><rating>3<//rating><Name>Stephen Newhouse<//Name>< Pictures>

Interesting drinks, but the service isn't great. This place was better 4 years ago.</Text>

< Review>
Manager handled my complained terribly. Basically flipped me after I complained about having stomach problem at the night after visiting, and even though I mentioned to her my food was mostly burned out and I have noticed many  health code violations when passing near the kitchen.
It seems like they don't care about the individual customer since they are doing well anyway. So while some consumers  wouldn't notice their management ethics,  or will complain about there expirenece, make no mistake they are there and they are terrible.

Some health code violation observed by me
1)I saw them few times handling after cooked food with bare hands.
2) moving meat from a bun (gluten) to gluten free wrap after they made a mistake.
3) one person didn't even have an head cover.
And trust me, there were more.< /Review>

Great service; a la carte menu; seemingly fresh ingredients; found the food to be slightly better than mediocre. Overall, it was okay, but I don't feel the need to return.</Text>

<Review>Solid spot. Burgers are $15...but proabably competing for best burger in LA with umami and fathers office.  They have a great lunch special monday through friday for $5. The burger used to be on that lunch special one day a week...but no more :/ Friendly bar tenders. They also have a superior happy hour from 12-7. Great ambiance, this is a great spot especially for lunch or happy hour. Recommended spot!</Review>< Pics>

<Text>"Yum yum yum! Had my first Manhattan ever and really loved, gonna be my next drink! I ordered crispy lobster nik niks just to try something new and I loved it. Wow! The original king’s hawaiian roll prepared with pancetta, tomato, and spicy russian. Soooo G-O-O-D!

I would order it with one of their delicious sides. My love had mushroom carbonara which was king oyster mushrooms, california truffle butter, and granapadano. I tried a little piece and it was pretty good, well cooked. They have a very nice beer and wine selection as well. What can I say? You gotta check it out!!"</Text>< Rate>

<review>I came here for dinner yesterday with a friend around 8:30PM. We forgot to make reservations so we had to wait about 30 mins for a table. We got seated at the smallest possible table upstairs, in a corner overlooking the restaurant. I already knew our table was going to be too small for us but it was getting late and we didn't want to wait any longer to eat.

What We Ordered:
- Bacon Wrapped Dates
- Housemade Shoestring French Fries
- Baked Mac and Cheese with Chorizo
- Prime Rib French Dip Nik Niks****
- Green Chili Burger
- Sea Salt Chocolate Chip Cookies**** - FREE but we bought some to take home too!

We ordered the recommended items her co workers suggested. The Bacon Wrapped Dates were a little too sweet for me but my friend enjoyed them. The Shoestring Fries were too soggy. I wished they were crispier. The Honey Mustard sauce was the savior for them though! It was soooo good! The Baked Mac and Cheese with Chorizo could have been cheesier but I love cheese. My friend thought they were cheesy enough. They didn't skimp on the chorizo either! It was 50% mac and 50% chorizo!! The Green Chili Burger was a little too charred for our likely. It tasted a little burnt. It definitely fell short in flavor. I do not know if it was because it came AFTER the Prime Rib French Dip Nik Niks or it really just isn't that good.

The highlight of the night.... the PRIME RIB FRENCH DIP NIK NIKS!!! OMG! It was sooo tender and melted in your mouth! The dipping sauce was what really made the dish though. It complimented the meat perfectly! I will go back JUST for this and the SEA SALT CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIES of course. :) We bought some to take home and they were fresh out of the oven warm...mmm...sooo good. I can't wait to eat them today!

Only complaint for the night was the fact it took us forever to flag down our waitress to pay for our meal. It was busy but she was no where in sight and I really wanted some napkins after eating those delicious, buttery cookies.

TIPS: MAKE RESERVATIONS! We left the restaurant at 10PM and there was STILL a line outside. It was a Thursday night...can't imagine how it is on the weekends lol.</review>< user>

Freaking amazeballs!!

How does one go wrong with a 7 day a week HH??? That's right ladies and gents you can quaff down some delicious libations for half its price! I was lucky enough to order the ever-so-yummy white sangria and was more surprisingly appeased ^_^. At $7 a pop I had two for the price of one ($3.50 each for those of you who hate math).

**I believe HH ends at 7 but don't quote me because we were in at 3ish and out before 6ish**

Now not only do they have tasty drinks but they have equally scrumptious cuisine options.

I got the crispy lobster nik niks , "savannah style", pancetta, heirloom tomato, Russian dipping sauce. The "nik niks" are essentially sliders (comes with 2) that are deceptively filling. The lobster was perfectly fried and the entire dish was absurdly perfect. I opted out of the pancetta but I am sure its salty flavor would have complimented the dish well.

I also had the ahi burger, sushi grade tuna, carefully ground and seared rare, avocado, spicy mayo on a butter bun. YUMMMM I can't for the life of me distinguish which I preferred more because they were both amazing. Great flavor combo and the bun was amazing.

BOTH great options.

The fries are also tasty and you get a huge sharable mountain for only $3.50

My friend ordered the baked mac + cheese, green chile, brown rice pasta with chorizo and it was the most mind blowing cheese fest ever. Once I am off my diet I will launch my face into a big steaming pile of this dish because the aroma and visuals were just tooo tempting!

Overall GREAT place to good for food or drinks. Great prices and great flavors.

**Also service was MARVELOUS. I told my waitress that I would need a drink in about 7 mins and magically one appeared once I finished my first in perfect timing. She was incredibly nice and prompt! **<//review>

I've been here a few times and it's one of the few places that I enjoying going back to in LA county. :)

Their cocktails are phenomenal and the wine selection is pretty decent. :) I love their happy hour, the food is good and not ridiculously expensive, and the service has always been very consistent.

The interior is well done. It's got a dim, party environment. It has a nice contrast with the overall kind of rough and dark atmosphere with hints of curves and old school design details to soften the interior up. A huge fan of the antique-like mirrors and the tin ceiling tiles.

The noise can be a little crazy with all the people and the music. It's definitely very happening during the evenings.

Love the Head In the Clouds, KD Bees Knees, and the Peach Orchard Boar. :)

Kale + quinoa salad w/ salmon. Gets a solid Five Stars. The grapes and the Manchego cheese gives the kale a much needed flavor boost. Salmon is a great addition to the dish! It doesn't come out dry and that is really key. :)

Recently tried their new menu addition: the Open Faced Grilled Cheese. Very excellent. It's got a sweet kick to it. Not really what I expected when I took the first bite. But I love surprises! And this was definitely a pleasant surprise! :D

One dish that was fairly Meh was the Ahi Burger. It didn't really stand out to me and the Ahi didn't really have a dominating presence. It didn't have as much potential as the other dishes I've tried here. I had a mound of avocado but the ahi was really lacking. Not bad, but not great either.

Their complimentary Sea Salt Cookies are where it's at! Highly addictive! Super delicious! Is a nice gesture at the end of a meal.

Service has always been friendly and fast. The waiters constantly checks in to make sure everything is to your satisfaction. The drink runners are quick. The staff made my experience comfortable and I felt well taken care of. :D

Definitely enjoy dropping in here once in awhile!<//review>

Summary: Great food, attentive service, slightly pricey but not unreasonably,  cool atmosphere, good drink selection, happy hour, and fun times.  Nothing that we didn't like.  Parking on the street or at a nearby parking structure.  Bathroom's are single occupancy, so be prepared to wait in line to...you know...

My in-laws were in town for Thanksgiving and decided to meet me after work in Santa Monica.  We toured around and enjoyed the sunset, then it was time to find a place to dine.  We made our way to The Misfit after Yelp guided us there (based on overall score and # of reviews).  It was a Wednesday evening at around 5pm, so happy hour was going strong but we were immediately seated in a booth upon walking in.

The decor inside is dark, and somewhat loud due to the bar-atmosphere, but well executed in an old-timey, book-room sort of way.  Dark woods, stacks of books behind the bar, and vintage looking pieces along the walls.  Despite the old style atmosphere, when we first met our server we observed that she was taking our order on a smartphone or PDA-sized tablet at the table.  Technology at its finest.

We ordered some drinks to start since it was happy hour and mixed drinks were half price.  My wife ordered a Bijou, which tasted like a sparkling greyhound, I ordered the white Sangria (delicious), my Father-in-law had a Manhattan, and my Mother-in-law had some other fruity mixed drink that she, too, enjoyed.

We soon ordered.  Here are the various things we got:

Gumbo - Thick, spicy, hot, tasty.  Not a traditional-style creation, but a delicious one, nonetheless.  Pretty filling too.

Mac 'n Cheese - Slightly on the oily side, but piping hot, cheesy, delicious, excellently textured pasta, etc. Awesome.

Kale and Quinoa salad - Fresh, substantial, decoratively presented, and tasty (from what I heard).  Mom-in-law seemed to enjoy this.

Chickpea Wraps - Spicy and tasty.  Filling, and healthy.

Lobster Nik Niks - Nicely fried, excellent texture, a decent amount of lobster, though certainly more slider-sized than full sandwich sized.  Quite good though.

Green Chile Burger - A nice kick, but missing produce on top.  Tasty, and pretty well prepared though.

Brussels Sprouts - Nice and firm, tasty, and in large portion.  Quite good.

BBQ Salmon with Arugula Salad - Also filling, healthy, fresh and delicious.

Ultimately, the common element in all of the food was freshness and quality.  Those two elements entailed deliciousness that we all enjoyed.  While not the cheapest meal around, it was still quite good and worth it.</Review>

I always come in here to get their delicious cookies, but when it comes to services its quite interesting they always seem to pass me off to  someone else, like today i came in and asked one of the waitress that if i can buy some of their cookies to go and sure enough she passed me off to another waitress,   i kiddingly said to the second waitress it seems to be a thing to pass me off to someone else every time I come here to buy these cookies, she just laughed it off, the part that bothers me the most was i had for got something and came back and the two waitress were talking about what i had just said it wasn't nice and i told them i heard that and she was a little embarrassed......no  professionalism and don't think i will be back here again i just don't like the way they make me feel...<//Text>

(Translated by Google) As tourists we were received and advised nicely. The burgers are freshly made and taste really good. A portion of french fries was huge and the sauces were also delicious. The food unfortunately costs a little more in the US but is okay. The toilets in the restaurant are getting used to.

Als Touris wurden wir nett empfangen und beraten. Die Burger sind frisch gemacht und schmecken total gut. Eine Portion Pommes war riesig und die Soßen dazu ebenfalls sehr lecker.

<rating>5< /rating><text>(Translated by Google) This restaurant was our first port of call when we flew to the US this year.
The staff was very nice and attentive. The restaurant itself was very clean. A little dark inside, but the ambience was good.
The food was amazing. It is of course not cheap, but it is worth it.
The fries and burger were freshly made and extremely delicious.
With the chips there were 3 sauces, which were also extremely good. I have nothing to complain about. The garnish with dragon fruit was also very unusual.
There are unfortunately no direct parking spaces and you have to drive into an expensive parking garage. But all the shops there have that in common.
The toilets were also very clean and big.
I would visit the restaurant again.

(Original)
Dieses Restaurant war unsere erste Anlaufstelle, als wir dieses Jahr in die USA geflogen sind.
Das Personal war sehr nett und aufmerksam. Das Restaurant an sich sehr sauber. Innen ein wenig dunkel, aber das Ambiente war gut.
Das Essen war der Wahnsinn. Es ist natürlich nicht ganz billig, allerdings lohnt es sich.
Die Pommes und der Burger waren frisch gemacht und extrem lecker.
Zu den Pommes gab es 3 Soßen, welche auch extrem gut waren. Ich habe nichts auszusetzen. Die Garnierung mit Drachenfrucht war auch sehr ausgefallen.
Parkplätze gibt es leider keine direkten und man muss in ein teures Parkhaus fahren. Das haben aber alle Läden dort gemeinsam.
Die Klos waren auch sehr sauber und groß.
Ich würde das Restaurant wieder besuchen.< /text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNWBPWBbGQYvojkW6eWlJai92--zqJB9F_3eRXj=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPfZAWD-8FoABNrCDbupW3YCPUIZhX8N1-RkVm9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMU44hECVBBzhbgWb4g92m-tYP74x_qIFt2sJxo=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNrNl-8V5O4QEbl_busm4vud3mf7vdJi6d9Qvhi=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< resp>
