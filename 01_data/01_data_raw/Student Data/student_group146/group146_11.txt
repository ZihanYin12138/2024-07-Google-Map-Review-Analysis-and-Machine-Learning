<Text>A lovely bit of serenity with many plants and flowers to enjoy and purchase. Located near many wineries on an easy, paved road to get there. Bring a picnic lunch to share with your family in the safe of beautiful Oak trees while watching the ducks on the pond. They also have treats like ice cream and soda to purchase. Fun for the whole family.  In a word: Lovely.< /Text>< pics>

<text>OMG! This place is a MUST see!  The website does NOT do it justice. This Flower Farm is beautiful. The gift shop is very cute and the customer service is superb. Not only are the demonstration garden's beautiful the daylilies garden is nothing I have ever seen before..The picnic area is very quaint and peaceful and you sit along the pond.  You can see the Koi swim by, there are turtles and bull frogs in the pond as well..We did see a snake in the road by the gate, it was a harmless kings snake. We didn't bother it, it didn't bother us.  If you're looking for a nice day trip, it's definitely worth the drive. Prices are great! Nice selection of fruits, veggies, succulents and if course Lily's. Over 1200 varieties. Upon purchase they give you paperwork on how to keep your Lily's alive. I'm not exactly a green thumb.< /text>< resp>

This review is for the pumpkin patch only.  This is a wonderful place to bring the family and pick out a pumpkin or two for the Halloween season.  They have a nice picnic area, a fun corn maze, plus a great selection of pumpkins.  The best thing about this place?  It does not have the insane crowds of Apple Hill during the fall season.  This was our 4th year coming here and we plan to continue to come here.<//review>

A beautiful place to spend an afternoon. The flower gardens are amazing and make for a lovely stroll. There are picnic areas, gift shop, restrooms, and nursery. In October they have a fun pumpkin patch with a free corn maze. Pumpkins come in quite the variety of shapes, sizes, and types (traditional, Cinderella style, gourds, you name it, they have it). Very reasonable pricing on large pumpkins. We got quite the selection. Just love this place and its offerings.< /review>

Very disappointed. Was not allowed on property due to having a small dog with me.  Drove to Plymouth just to visit thus facility. In 96 degree weather, I also couldn’t leave my pet in the car.<//review>

On it's own, the Flower Farm is a great place to take a walk through their gardens, shop at the garden shop, or purchase plants at the nursery.  Staff are always knowledgeable about the products and plants sold.  The Flower Farm specializes in daylilies of which they literally have thousands of varieties.  The Flower Farm also hosts a number of great events throughout the year including an Easter egg hunt and a corn maze with a pumpkin patch in October.<//text>

Absolutely beautiful grounds, and it's so wonderful being able to walk around them freely. They're thoughtfully laid out, with benches under the trees for shade, a very cute picnic area, and clean restrooms. Wonderful stop if you're in the area.< /text>

<Text>I being my family here in all seasons. Lillies are their specialty.  In the spring it is a riot of color from all the lillies they have planted in the fields surrounding the property. The planted grounds are ideal to see what they are selling and how well they would do in your yard. The planted grounds are extensive, so you can take a long walk. In summer they feature all California varietals as well as perennials and annuals. The store changes with plant products for spring and summer and they have holiday items as well. This is just a great place for everyone.</Text>< user_name>

First time visiting this office, and my wife and I had a great experience!
The front office staff were very nice and helpful, and Dr. Yee was absolutely amazing! She is more thorough and then most doctors I have been examined by, and explains everything she does and what she finds. Great personality too!</review>

My first visit here was so nice. I felt welcomed, safe, respected & appreciated. The staff was professional and thorough. Dr. Chang took time to answer all my questions. She also made sure she told me my back of eye picture looked good before I left. The staff was so nice helping me select frames allowing me to try on as many as I wanted even though they had to clean every pair. Thank you Century Eye Care.

<Text>I've never been to an optometrist office where the doctor's examination is more thorough, explained in detail and provided so many different options as was my visit with Dr Matty Chang at Century Eye Care. Not only professional in her examination but very friendly and personable that she made me feel very comfortable throughout the entire visit. While I was there in the actual visit I was thinking so already that I would refer my mother because I know that my mom would like the treatment that I got myself.< /Text>< Date>

<rating>5< /rating><Review>I’ve been wearing contact lens for the past 12 years and recently began experiencing some unique issues with my eyes that I haven't had before. I was really concerned but Dr. Chang listened to my problems closely and addressed them thoroughly. After the initial exam, she gave me a new type of contacts to try and when those didn’t work out, gave 3 more to try until I found a brand/fit that was perfect for me. She is very patient and knowledgeable and her office staff is helpful as well. If you’re looking for vision care, I highly recommend going to her office!</Review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

<text>Dr. Chang is always very professional and kind. The office has made changes to adapt during this COVID-19 time.

Meeting V for the first time was pleasant too. She was very professional and took the time to assist us with  our frame choices, and answered all questions.  We will continue to us them for all our vision issues.<//text><userid>101945147746531382196< /userid><Response>None< /Response><Pics>None<//Pics><Gmap_id>0x80dcd6a7d3526693:0x454d20af25e8aeb9< /Gmap_id>< Date>

<review>I have been coming to Dr. Chang for many years and she is the best optometrist I have found in this area. Very efficient and very accurate. She and her staff are very pleasant and easy to work with. I always got my glasses on time and accurately made.

One thing I noticed this time. I am fan of Oakley frames and they were low on Oakley frame. I mentioned that to Dr. Chang and she told me that she check on it.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

First of all, I love that they are open on Saturdays since it might be tough to go during the week. The staff is friendly and helpful when trying to decide within an array of frames.

Even though I see Dr. Chang once a year, I don't feel like another patient coming through the door and able to chat with her like an old friend.<//Review>

Dr. Chang does a great job getting your prescription just right!  I have worn contact lenses all my life.  Most optometrists will fit me with exactly what's on the charts.  Dr. Chang discussed with me about making some slight changes and my contact lenses were more comfortable and my vision as clear as ever.  I won't go anywhere else.</Review>

<Text>Never mind what I said earlier about it being amazing. The Pros- Eye checkups are fast and simple and appointments are great. The Cons- The people do not know what they are doing especially the person who adjusted my glasses. When I told them to adjust my glasses they bended my frame. Also when I come there the next day they never fixed for me saying "we didn't do it" even I do have proof of them bending the frame. In addition this was a $130 frame.
Summary- Goods- The Doctor had very good experience and the appointments didn't take that long.
Cons- Bending my frame and lying to your consumers.
I advise you to go somewhere else to get it adjusted.<//Text>< pictures>

From the beginning, the mechanic showed up on time and started to work on the car. He performed quickly and was cautious with the vehicle and it’s components. I asked for the favor of tightening the handbrake for me and did it without charge! This service is great to have and I would recommend it to my family and friends!< /Review>

Needed to get a new alternator installed. Car wouldn't even start in order to get it to a repair shop. Wrench gave me a competitive quote and had a technician scheduled to my home within 24 hours. Great service, friendly people from start to finish. Same price, perhaps a bit less, than if I went to a shop.< /text>

<review>The mechanic was fine. It's the service administration that works with the warranty providers to make sure your car gets paid for. If your warranty ends in 2 weeks, don't use this company. They do NOT call in claims same day. I made it very clear that my warranty was ending soon and to please call it in ASAP. I was informed that wasn't an issue because payment would need to be verified regardless to proceed. A week went by and no claim had been sent in. I now owe a deductible that could have been completely avoided. I will be going elsewhere for the repairs.< /review>< pictures>

I was weary at first but their prices are VERY similar to regular mechanics. And they come to you! Very good service. I've used them twice so far and I won't be letting anyone else touch my car from now on. If you are worried about price, don't. If you are worried about quality, don't. If you are worried about convenience...THEY.COME.TO.YOU.<//review>

I was extremely impressed with this company, the services provided, the quality of work performed, and the thorough inspection given. Steven took the time to discuss the issues.... and fix them. I can’t recommend this company enough, and I am extremely satisfied with the overall results. On an added note, I appreciated the professionalism... and the way I was constantly notified regarding time frames, job descriptions, and how I was even provided with my technician’s qualifications. This is definitely a company I would highly recommend, and I look forward to contacting them in the future with any car issues I may acquire.</review>

Will be using Wrench as my primary mechanics moving forward. Their customer service is ridiculously great. I communicate with them via phone calls and emails and they’re always time efficient, genuine, honest and friendly. I never feel like they’re trying to sell me something.
My Mercedes 2011 C300 unfortunately was having an unexpected steering wheel lock; and the mechanic, Javier was very honest and tried to the best of his ability to resolve my issue. Afterwards, he recommend me to go to the dealer since it’s a luxury car.
I did receive a quote hours later from Wrench saying that they can fix my problem, I emailed back with my confusion prior to my conversation with Javier. I then called customer service and the two women that assisted me were understanding that I didn’t want to have Wrench come out to “fix” my issue and then will be unable to then send me to Mercedes which would end up costing me over $2k. Of course, I was hoping that Wrench could fix my issue since their quote was significantly lower than Mercedes. However, Dale from services emailed me back apologizing and said that the mechanic was correct and that I do need to go the deal ship. Bummer but I appreciate their honesty and in a way, I feel like they care about my financial worries.
I will be using them again in the near future (knock on wood not too soon) but they’ll my go-to moving forward. Highly recommend.<//text>

Awesome service! I ended up paying more than what quoted because Roberto found another issue but it was still way cheaper than the dealer and to make matters worse ... for me not Wrench ... it was a safety issue he found. So great full ... great mechanic ... will definitely be using this service again. Thank you ... my car is running just like new again<//text>

<text>My experience with Wrench was truly a blessing!!!! I was amazed when I  found them on Google  - that they come out to you!!
I had other mechanics keep my car for days and weeks to complete a job. But Richard (the mechanic) completed the job in a few hours.
The price was very reasonable and I'm very pleased. It's hard to find a company you can trust!!!  Great job!!!<//text>< Rate>

< Review>
Scheduled a mechanic to come down to my home as a next day service for 65.00 and take a look at my boyfriends mustang. Richard came down and hooked it to a computer and was real friendly answering my million questions and running tests. We already had a good idea what was wrong but he confirmed what needed to be fixed to get the car running. Would recommend to others. Fair pricing, friendly service.< /Review>

<review>I needed a diagnostic service for my car, and was able to schedule for a mechanic to come and diagnose the problem within the next day or two.  It was easy to set up an appointment on the website.  It tells you which days and times are available and how much it would cost.  I also  the fact that there were appointments available in the early evening as I work during the day.  It also tells you the name of the mechanic that will be coming as well.  The mechanic was  on time and was diligent in diagnosing the issue.  Overall, it was a great experience.  I would recommend this to my friends and family.</review></record>

Lousy customer service. The mechanic never showed up (twice) . They kept rescheduling and finally I got tired of waiting. The customer service rep was completely unapologetic.

Would not recommend this svs. If there was an option to give the 0 stars I would.<//review>

Can’t believe they hired people like this on a great company like VERIZON</Text>< pictures>

Came in today to upgrade my parents phone. Christian was a tremendous help. He was very informative, helpful and patient. He took the time to explain and went over our phones plans. He gave us great deals. We ended up buying 3 tablets and upgrading my parents phones. THANK YOU for your help!!!< /review>

<text>Last night my husband and I went to purchase a charger at Verizon. Luis sold us one, helped me with my cracked screen protector and told me how I can get a better deal on my phone service. He really went above and beyond to make us happy. Thank you so much Luis! We will come back to your store next time we need anything for our phones!< /text>< Pictures>

Came in to get an upgrade on my phone and these guys are super friendly and eager to help. Marcus was amazing and explained everything to me so well. I have never been so happy with an experience with Verizon and I'm already a devoted customer. Wow, definitely would go out of my way to come back to this store!</Review>

He worked with us to trade up after a previous unfortunate purchase, he advised us to go with a cheaper plan based on our 4G consumption and threw in discounts and a free case.

Nothing but the run around from these guys. Took 3 months to get screen protectors for our new phones. Employee that sold us the phones totally botched our bill, and when we went in to ask about our bill the employee no longer worked there and the manager that was there was ZERO help. Customer service here is horrible. I'll never be going back.< /review>

<text>Let me put my 2 cents in here cause, i LOVE the seldom opportunities of being able to say positives of an establishment and/or its representatives. While I understand and can even agree that many places especially local/state/federal places can have a negative experience potentially attached to it, it doesn't mean they ALWAYS will. So concerning THIS particular post office, (especially being such a busy hub) I am honored and grateful to be able to shoutout two of its employees, Murphy and June. Both Murphy and June are People that engage the public (not always an easy job in any industry) and have my 5 star stamp of approval to the point that I will say the following.

1.)This facility could easily be a flagship training facility and represent how all places should be and...

2.) Sadly, I'm not wealthy but if I ever win a lotto or had a successful business,  I would offer them both the chance to fill out their check to bring them on board cause I demand the best and these two exemplify that entirely.

Lastly, I'd say thank you to both and to any others that put their best face on, even if they might not feel like wearing it at the moment. Thank you Murphy and June.
Will add names to this as I come across these experiences with others.

My package was due on the 23rd of February it’s now March 8th. This place had my package last. Zero updates , Zero feedback spent $85.00 on what’s in my package and I’m expected to be patient. Simple the Worst!< /text>

Very bad. We went there 5 times for a finger print between 10~3pm, the people in charge were not there for 4 times;

We waited until he came back from lunch, but he said his working time is over so he refused to do it

Totally irresponsible!

and that man is the only person who can do it in the whole post office

Not only us, a lot of customers went there and cannot get their figure print

Why customer need to wait for him and still cannot get the service? Didn’t customer pay for it? Is he the god so that everyone needs to follow? If this post office cannot do the job, then just fire the man and let other post office to do it!<//Text>

<Text>The people who work at this office are very rude and snappy. Honestly seems like they don't like their jobs and there's a high turnover rate in general for the post office. The woman I spoke to today was automatically snapping at me before I could ask her my question or get to her from the line I was waiting it. Seems as if the employees get away with choosing who they can act rude with. Every time I leave this office I feel yelled at my the employees over basic questions that didn't involve that much stress to begin with.<//Text>< Pictures>

Package I had ordered from new York.   Was delivered to the wrong address.   After being delayed for nearly a week.   (Even through tracking said it was in my mail box.  It wasn't.)   Absolutely horrible customer service!   Has a voice activated menus.  (And I have a speech impairment.   And is impossible for me to use effectively.)   And when I did finally get an option to speak to a live person.  Not even sure if it was the right dept.    The wait time was thirty to forty minutes.   These lazy SOB's owe me 24 dollars!   For the loss of the item I had purchased.   They are worse than the cable company and yes.  Even collection agency's.   As far as customer service goes.  Are fine as long as they work.  But if something screws up.  Watch out for these money grubbing creeps.  Always demanding more for stamps.<//review>

Came to apply for passport, employees do not acknowledge your presence. Passport people were not available, if i did not speak up god knows how long i would have stood in line and i was the only one in line.</Review>

<Review>I love that this hub is so accessible to us. Everything sent out from here seems to get to its destination faster.
The people are competent, friendly and efficient. They don't rush customers, but will ask that you stand to the side while you complete something in order to help the next customer.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

Open til 8:30 PM! Easy parking, never a line and sweet helpful staff. Plus it's the last stop out for outbound mail so your mail will get there faster. Is there anything else you could ask for?</text>

<text>I asked a woman post officer at the desk  if she could advise me on how to send an iPad to a friend in Thailand. Her response was, "put it in a box and mail it." Then she added, "we don't package things for people here."
I said I didn't expect her to. So the first part would be funny if she was a comedian, but she was a postal worker who has experience, I assume, on how to package things, such as, a.) what would be the right box and b.) how much does it cost to send different ways, and c.) is there a customs form I need to fill out....etc. etc. After waiting in line for a good 20 minutes, this woman was not much of a help.< /text><UserId.>111224169441008413154<//UserId.>< Response>

<username>Day P</username><Time>1388520834426<//Time><rate>5</rate><Text>The Postal Workers here are very nice and very well experienced.  I have an online business so, I often have last minute orders so, if I have an Express Mail or if I can wait until after 5:00pm to send it with First Class mail then, I much prefer to take my packages over to this office in West Oakland. It might be a little out of the way but, it's open until 8:30pm and always has 3 people working the counter (sometimes 4) so, rarely is there a line (overall, much faster than all other East Bay locations) which is especially great during the holidays! This office decorates during the seasons and they  also manage the "Secret Santa" gift program, collecting letters to the North Pole every year. They do such a great job!</Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

They open at 8am, it's now 8:15 and doors are still locked. I'm only here because  The carrier lied and said they couldn't access my mailbox. They have my package, I have to get to work, but I guess I'm just at their mercy until they feel like showing up to work today?< /Text>

Nice people working there but SSSSLLLLLOOOOOOOWWWWWW. I got there maybe ten minutes after they opened and it took me an hour to pick up a certified letter. The man behind the counter was friendly but took a long time and was not very efficient: rather than ask each individual person in line what they needed to pick up, he should have asked several people and grabbed all their parcels at once. Would have saved him the trips and all of us the time. He seemed a little crazy, too: talking to himself and the packages the entire time yet unable to make eye contact with the people.< /Text>

I went here to pick up a load of mail going to washington state. As soon as i went onto the dock i was treated as some second rate person and told if i didn't hurry up and back in i would be charged with delay of federal mail. Usps is 100% subsidised by the us taxpayer and is out of their mind if they think they can treat their carriers the way they do. I hope all of you are replaced by FedEx and Amazon and find yourselves without jobs on street corners.< /Review>

Amazing drink quality with amazing food. One of the best places to go and grab drinks and snacks. They offer a wide variety, but I personally like the taro milk tea. Paired with their spiral potato, you are guaranteed a great experience. The vibes are also immaculate. 5/5 stars for me.<//review>

Drinks were also good AND at good prices. The only downside is parking is a little tough.<//Text><gmap_id>0x808f7e85f4488889:0x23cf9142f1b44efc< /gmap_id><user_id>106060670572396760908< /user_id><Name>Arlene Romana< /Name></record>

<review>This place is very tiny for how busy it usually is, though it's usually not that big of a problem. The reason I can't give it 5 stars, is because of how frequent the workers forget orders or get orders wrong. Maybe it's not their fault, I don't know.<//review></record></dataset><record>

Nice bubble tea shop in excelsior. Came here after having tacos and wanted something sweet. Most of these shops are nearly identical. Full menu with various offering along with mostly fried food. A intermittent rotating signage looks awesome at night time. The place just smells like a dessert shop should. Staff are eagerly waiting to take orders then rush to the back and makes them. Hong Kong pop music is heard blasting away. Green tea milk tea was made to my liking as directed. Best part were the pearls being soft and chewy, but not congealed. May come back for egg puff and negotiations.<//text>

They have a variety of snacks as well (I tend to go for the egg puffs and rice rolls) but those take a bit longer so if you're in a rush I wouldn't order food.

<Text>They really should have had a restroom. I can understand why they would not want to have one but I spent almost $ 27 on boba drinks, a slushie for my son and two egg puffs, you'd think they would have at least that amenity. I won't be coming back here anytime soon unless absolutely necessary.<//Text>< resp>

This is my favorite bubble tea place in the area. I like that the teas are not overly sweet and that there is a sliding scale of sweetness. I've had a few different flavors of hot and cold teas and tried their almond slush - all good. Never had the food.</Text>

<Text>A great tea shop. It gets a little busy because it's by a bus stop.  Service is great. I usually go in the morning and the girl who works in the morning Is always so friendly!

The crema tea is slightly expensive and the tea options aren't very much. Don't ever get sea salt crema iced coffee, savory and bitterness do not go together. I ordered that and can't help but think I wasted $5<//review>

An egg puff, which was also ok. Given this area has no better boba store, I would give 3 stars. Not sure if I would go back.. given the price.< /review>< rating>

It's no boba guys but I would go here over quickly any day. Biggest thing for me in the tapioca is actually consistently cooked well so it's not too chewy and not too soft. Good job! Best boba in the neighborhood. Good place to hang out. They always have music videos playing.< /Review>

Tasty chocolate egg puffs! Good bobas too. However they don't open until 10:45am ish on Saturday, even though it's posted that they open at 9am.< /review>

< Review>
Love this place! Clean, friendly staff! Tried the Spam Rice bowl as well as a Matcha Green Tea with toppings(the toppings are free! well u only get 3 toppings, still though its free! what more can you ask for! its better than nothing, right!) What i like about this place is thats its a small little shop but clean. Highly recommend it! My friend also recommended the slush beverages, i'll try it next time i go! they even give a loyalty stamp card. i thinks its after 6 stamps u get a free beverage!</Review>

She took extra time out of her day just to fix my hair. We spent a while talking about how to achieve my dream hair and her kindness and patience can not be overstated. My hair came out beautifully and I will be booking her again to add color.

<text>The best salon experience I've had. Everyone was very welcoming. Clean and lovely on the eyes. I made an appointment to have platinum ash blonde done and it came out fantastic. Met my forever hair stylist today, Novia. I highly recommend her. She was easy to talk to, not just about my hair goals but life over all. She explained on depth all my questions, concerns as well as enlightened me with useful tips I'm hair care and upkeep. Made my whole experience great and walked out more educated than I walked in. I will be going back to her in the future. Plenty of parking in the back parking garage/complex. This place is not only a hair salon but also a nail and spa, etc. I'll be trying out those services in the future. Thank you for the wonderful experience and for recommending the restaurant Rembrandt's, DE-LICIOUSSS.</text>< Rating>

<Text>Receptionist very welcoming when you come in.  They take your temperature and have you sign a waiver regarding Coronavirus which I think is a great idea there is hand sanitizer everywhere.  They wipe everything down taking all precautions which I think is great. My stylist Alex is a great person very hospitable and friendly love coming to get my haircut and thank you Salon Lujon for making my experience safe and fantastic!</Text>< Pictures>

Love this salon. If you want a facial ask for Desi! If you want your hair done (cut, etc.) ask for Mihaela! I've been going here for years. Its hip without making me feel out of place, cuz I use to be cool in the 80s/90s soooo. ;) Anyway, go and really use anyone of the staff, because they are really great.<//Review>

I would just like to review Desiree one of the stylists.  I went to her before she was at this Salon but I’d be ungrateful if I did not give her credit.  I came to Desiree with chopped up hair.  A previous stylists, despite my instructions, went crazy on my hair trying to do her own thing. I also had an illness that made my hair not curl and it died.  I had little hope it could be fixed but I walked in for the walk in special and explained what I wanted if it was possible.  She went to work, and she did work hard; I could tell she really cared.  And you know, she made a miracle, it was marvelous.  She used better scissors and better technique than I had seen in a long time or since.  In this business you have technicians and professionals.  Desiree is definitely a professional.  Thank you!  Sad part is I moved or I’d be loyally there every few months.<//text>

That I would have to reschedule for what I wanted. That she would only be able to cut, this is my only day off in a week. Why do I have to go around a lazy salonist who doesn't want to talk to clients. I left a tip not to be rude but I'm not coming back.

Your stylist was already booked with another client after you, so she was correct that she didn’t have the time to color your hair. Our stylists are not lazy and are on their feet all day long working with their clients. I’m very confused that your review says it was a nice haircut yet you hated it. Our stylists stand behind their work and always try to correct their work when you have concerns.'}</response><pics>None</pics><user>103394893074188225197<//user>< user_name>

Talk about a great place to get a hair cut. My wife and I go to Steve Lehman. Now this guy is the new hair stylist to the stars. Thank goodness he still likes me. After 15 years I still suggest Steve. If you are in the hunt for a top notch, knows what he is doing, get's it right the first time Hair doer upper. Then stop by an see Steve.

Tell him Mike sent you. He might do a little dance but he will do your hair like you are the next up and coming star on the big screen.</Text>

<Review>Salon LuJon is where you get a stylist whose focus is on you.  This salon is charming, reasonably priced, clean and tastefully decorated. Free parking, free coffee and lots of love for its clients.  the stylists are professional, talented and caring.  I would recommend any of the many stylist in the salon.  They are all artists but my favorite is Peter Ray. He transforms a really bad hair day into a WOWWW I look good.  He is a magician.  This salon is where the magic happens.  Best salon in the OC.</Review>< name>

You can tell when people love what they do and it really shows here. Definitely recommend to anyone seeking a safe place to store their stuff.

<Rating>1</Rating><Text>I’d give 0 stars if I could. The employee gave me the key to check the unit before renting. Upon exiting to go to the office and purchase. The manager blocked me in and yelled at me to enter the code or we couldn’t leave. He walked up to my car in a threatening manner before finally accepting that the employee GAVE me the key and TOLD me to look before renting. Terrible management. Do not rent here there are a million better options that will treat you like a customer should be treated.<//Text>< pictures>

Awful customer service. Can't even take a payment over the phone correctly if you can even get them to answer phone the phone that is. Office woman was incredibly rude at me even though it was her fault I couldn't make my storage payment. I repeated the number over and over and over and she would say the number didn't work even before I finished saying it. So many times I had to go out of my way and make a special trip just to pay in person. Definitely regret doing business at this location.<//text>

<text>This particular site is crooked! The managers are not helpful in any way.  They refuse to call their main office in Fresno to confirm an occupant's name on a unit.

<Text>The banh mi was really skimpy on the inside. It’s all about balance and although the bread is fresh and perfect, it was most of the sandwich. I wish there was a more meat, but it was also low on the pickled vegetables!

Pate flavor was great though.<//Text>< Gmap_id>

Have been coming to this place regularly in the past 10 years. Small place, really good banh mi and spring roll and.... Basically everything. Good price. They made their bread in house and daily; Crispy and light, and perfect for banh mi. Spring rolls are light and refreshing. Vietnamese coffee is strong.< /text>

This is one of the best Vietnamese sandwich shops in Los Angeles county, offering up freshly made food items and drinks. Everything tasted authentic and flavorful. This is where I go for lunch and a quick snack. BTW, they only accept cash.</review>

The special number 2 sandwich is very good! Filled with ham and pâté and perfectly balanced with herbs. The bread here is different, longer and less crusty. The BBQ pork number 8 is too sweet. The Vietnamese coffee is weak and sweet.
Free public parking (the parking lot is shared with Starbucks so it's absolutely crazy), cash only.</review>

<UserId.>114981085000524167567< /UserId.><Review>I love this small family owned place. They bake their bread fresh daily and make their deli meats and pate in house. I like their number one and number two but I also really like their bbq pork sandwich. I also love the viet coffee, fresh sugar cane drink and avocado smoothie. This is my go to place for a simple casual fresh breakfast/lunch during these hard times! FYI, if you buy 5 sandwiches, you get a 6th free! Great for families! ❤️</Review></record>

Their sandwiches are also great! They make their bread in-house so it's fresh everyday. Friendly service on top of great food and great prices 👍🏼.< /Text>< response>

In this area, it is the original one while others come and go. I still prefer their sandwiches over other. They offer other foods and treats too. Not much of a place but I go there for the food. Very reliable for over 30 years.< /review>

The employees are friendly, and helpful. I ordered the special and the pork belly sandwich with an Avacado shake. The special, was tasty and the avocado shake was on point. I'm going back for the those two. The pork belly didnt taste to fresh. The service was fast. It's dark in there and I like that there is only 4 ppl at a time allowed in.<//text>

Best BBQ pork sandwich in town. They don't use the highest quality cuts but they marinate it in the sweet red sauce that gives it a more delicious flavor even when compared to higher end shops like Mr. Baguette.< /review>

Bread is soft yet crunchy and won't hurt your mouth like other baguette places. This place has been around for at least 20 years and food quality is still superb! Parking can be difficult to find since it is sharing with a Starbucks. I recommend the special #2 with additional fried eggs.<//review>

<text>My favorite here is the honeycomb pandan cake that they have wrapped up and packaged in the front. The texture is something else. I'm not sure exactly what it is, but it's amazing.

Also the sandwiches are good too. So simple. Love this place< /text><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None< /response><gmap_id>0x80c2c53e37185003:0xb88607e43ee2637b</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Their chicken pie is very delicious that I recommended for lunch or snack because it is $1.50 each.

<text>Ba Le makes one of the better Ban mi sandwiches in the San Gabriel Valley, and it is because of the higher quality baguettes they use.

I find some of their pickled vegetables a little lacking, but their rest of the ingredients used is well put together. In addition, they do put just enough of their manonnaise spread to make a very tasty sandwich.

At $3.50 for their basic and 4 bucks for a Dac Biet, they are exemplary for a fabulous cheap eats. There are other fillings such as chicken, pork, and beef too.

Their fried egg rolls are made well, but lack much flavor. There are many other places that do a better job.

Ba Le is a Vietnamese deli, thus you will find many other traditional eats here too. For sweet coffee lovers they also make a delicious Cafe su dá. Starbucks, just outside the parking lot, should be very jealous.

Everything is Cash Only, and there is no restroom nor tables. They are strictly a grab and go joint.

P.S. excellent play on a creative name.< /text>< Pics>

<review>Woowee! I found a Banh Mi restaurant that actually knows how to make legit Vietnamese sandwiches. They don't cheat you on the meats and veggies or give you mostly bread. Eating their sandwiches does not leave a guilty and greasy feeling. I recommend their BBQ pork sandwiches or cold cuts. While you're at it, they have great Vietnamese iced coffee (sweet and strong). They accept CASH only.</review>< Pictures>

I can't say they're the best since there are so many good choices around here. I am so blessed when it comes to VN food in this area. The taste will hold its own to any other sandwich places. That's a pretty tall order right there for this neighborhood.

Atmosphere: 3/5 stars
Nothing to dream about. Hole in wall with counter for ordering.  To go only. But hey, it's great for grab and run when you don't have time.

Service: 4/5 stars
Order at counter and pay for food. The women there were very helpful and make sure you know they'll take care of your order.

Expense: 5/5 stars
Cheap. Cheap. Cheap. Did I mention cheap? I did? Well it's cheap (price wise not quality wise), but cash only.

Return: 5/5 stars
Solid and cheap VN sandwiches, coffee, juices, side dishes; what else can you ask for? No, don't answer that... Just come and enjoy the food. Return? Do you have to ask? ;)< /Review><user>107870332235268466291<//user>< Response>

Less than $5 per sandwich you should just try them all! Don’t forget the $2 boba drinks.</review><Rate>5< /Rate><Pictures>None</Pictures><user>112785282195912620731< /user>< username>

No frills but really good stuff. There are two and only two truly respected Viet sandwich shops in Alhambra: ba le and mi tho. Ba le has the soft bread style sandwich with a dab of butter. Mi tho has the hard crust style with deeply roasted meat. Ba le is more commerical feeling and mi tho is like what you would get if your Vietnam vet uncle who has bounced from job to job the past twenty years, drinks a little too much, but is real fun to party with made the meat.

This is where I go if I want a morning sandwich. Mi tho is where I go if I want an afternoon treat.< /review>

Worst Place Ever.. They are not there to protecting and services ..I've been calling all day to check on my family member.. I got nothing but the run around.. I asked if they could assure me everything was okay.. She flat out said NO.. (officer Montgomery) so now me and my family have to drive to there police station for the second time today and hopefully speak to someone willing to do the job</review>

Worst police station off all LAPD stations.
No one answers the phone, operator not helpful at all.
Would give zero, but need to give at least one.
Call 3 time for same problem, finally got thru after 30 minutes. All they did was transfer to a number that is not in service.

I guess that's what I get for living in a " Dark " neighborhood.< /review>

<Text>I am not going to go completely public on my experiences with the LAPD8 all I can say is that I have done everything to report an individual who isn't in jail , bullies me tried to intimididate me in every way possible it's really concerning that the LAPD has done nothing, but take reports now idk if something more drastic should happen for that person that has been doing this to me an army veteran too by the way. Now I'm in no way am going to go out of my way to look for trouble, but it's really getting to the point where even calling LAPD to actually do their job is pointless because I have a witness and I am not satisfied how this had been handled by trained individuals who are suppose to uphold the laws were suppose to follow. Not only that I have been provoked or get a reaction out of me which I don't want to happen at all never in my wildest dreams. I do everything I can to stay at home,  enjoy life,  spend time with my family and friends without ever getting into or running into any trouble at all. But thanks for all your help and I can tell you that all they day is get a restraining order, now what good is that if it gets denied by the judge?? So what now huh???< /Text><resp>None<//resp></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Worst 'service' to the community evee. You'd think that asking to speak to the watch commander would make a difference yet it's still the same crappy service. You call for a unit and they take a day andforber to even feel like responding and the phones never seem to ring on their end. How are they suppose to get people to trust them when even a simple house call is going way out of their way.</Text>< rating>

Called to report a homeless woman with a knife trying to assault my mother in a public street, they never came. We held the woman down for more then 2hrs and nothing. I kept calling but they said they couldn’t do anything because it wasn’t a real emergency. A CRAZY WOMAN WITH A KNIFE TRYING TO KILL MY MOM ON THE STREET WITH PEOPLE AROUND. We ended up taking the knife from her, and leaving her there in the street. She picked up a piece of broken bottle and kept walking. Idk if she assaulted other people, but I guess it’s not an emergency.</text>

<Review>I've tried calling several times since my car was stolen in Dec 2016. They don't ever answer the phone. It just rings and rings and rings until it hangs up. When I went down to the station they were talking to me as if I stole my own car or something. I was 19 years old at the time, living in (still currently) Glendale, and had just flew back in from NY to discover my car was missing from my home. All they did was treat me as a suspect. I never got a police report number or copies of anything. I was distraught for a long time! I wasn't going to school and could not work. My car had been crashed, trashed on the inside b the police, had crime scence powder everywhere!! and had several bullet holes in it. All I could do is cry while they tell me it's a crime to lie on a police report. F this staff!< /Review>< pics>

<Review>Called the cops about stolen property and I basically had to beg to file a claim.

On a separate  occasion I called about a man publicly masturbating in front of me and they said, verbatim, "What do you want us to do about it?"  Umm I don't know, your goddamn job is to "serve and protect" maybe look for the guy???

I legitimately just had someone steal property, exactly fifteen minutes ago, and don't even want to call them for help.<//Review><Resp>None< /Resp><user_name>Geegee Tii< /user_name><Rate>1</Rate><gmap_id>0x80c2c9c9bbdafd15:0xdfb7958ed0237009< /gmap_id>< Pictures>

They act and help like a true officer should, they have impacted my life in a very positive way the few times ive had contact with them. May God bless 77th station, it's officers and the entire LAPD department, I proclaim safety and protection over your lives in Jesus name!

Thank you all for your service to the community.</Review>< Pics>

Are you serious, man so what would of been an emergency? waited till the lady stabbed your mother in the guts? And i totally agree on you about our pets, my friends dog was shot twice by a police officer, after they raided his house acordding to them he had tons of drugs and weapons, they left empty handed and humiliated but left one family member dead, "Gordo" this knuckle head was so vicious it took 2 shots to bring him down, where ever you are Gordo, theres a special place for Pigs like those and their Badges , Justice will one day be made.<//Review>

Dear LAPD,

How many more Pet Dogs are you going to shoot before you get non-lethal training for your Officers? I don’t care that you have a badge and a gun, it doesn’t change the FACT that the use of LETHAL FORCE on a Pet is a COWARDLY ACT, and it’s beyond primitive, it has been getting very old, for a very long time now, not everyone buys into the propaganda that your Officers feared for their lives, this is Police Brutality on our Voiceless Citizens, our Pets are our family members.

If someone shoots a Police Dog there’s a manhunt, and no stone is left unturned until they catch their suspect that harmed the Police Dog, and they’re sent to prison for a lengthy time, but what about our Pets? I’ll tell you about our Pets, they get their jaws blown off by your Police Officers.

On Saturday 3/24/18 LAPD Officers were conducting an investigation in the area of the 5800 block of Willoughby avenue when they entered the home of Brett Kerby and Norma Lopez, and LAPD opened fire on the family Pet Dog. As a taxpaying Citizen of L.A. County and as an Animal Advocate, I would like to know what forms of non-lethal methods were used prior to the use of lethal force on this family Pet? LAPD Officers make too much money to carry on like Keystone Cops.

Sincerely,
Patty Jackson
Animal Advocate<//text>

< Review>
The officers at this station are the true meaning of public servants at its best. They are very professional, courteous. They act and help like a true officer should, they have impacted my life in a very positive way the few times ive had contact with them. May God bless 77th station, it's officers and the entire LAPD department, I proclaim safety and protection over your lives in Jesus name!

Thank you all for your service to the community.</Review>

Came here in 95 scared to death I was going to lose my son to the gangs, I will never forget the Office that spoke with my son Officer Mathews, well that tour and talk helped my son, he has never been to jail/prison and never got involved with gangs big s/o to77th , well I'm back again with my grandson and I hope the same thing happens, I live in San Pedro, but they WILL NOT even speak with my grandson, called 77th after all these years and guess what I was told to bring my grandson in and an Officer will speak with him.  77th please show the Harbor Division how its done.< /Review>

<text>(Translated by Google) Mo experecis com this police station was very bad the neighbor broke my windshield and I broke the car and I have to pay my expense 950 dollars for rallones and the windshield because the detective in charge of the case not your time to come to check the cameras of the Church or the market that was the test to see but when I checked to speak with the dectetive case manager to follow up on the case the supervisor treated me very badly and told me that I did not send video in record point and never came to review the video because every day I went to the market to ask if the police even came to review the video and the owner of the mark told me that nobody said. The most ridiculous thing you say to me is that the case is already open so that if other than that I did not like the treatment that Tetive gave me, John speaks to one as one is the delicuenta, so he breaks the glass to steal pursue The dectetive do not care

<pics>None< /pics><review>(Translated by Google) I was transferred from another police station, I have more than three hours calling and not trying. I want to report that a certain Tommy William is scamming people, asking for confidential information from people looking for a house to rent.
If they don't answer, they are very busy, and if so, why don't they put a voicemail?
Anyway, let's see how many more scams this man who rents the property1232 W 73rd St, Los Angeles, CA 90044.
Greetings 😉

<Text>Good quality food, good portions and remarkable authenticity flavors. It is a original Mexican cuisine.

The food is definitely in large portions. More importantly because it's popular I recommend doing a reservation unless you are courageous like me and are willing to plan your evening near the area to be within 5 minutes from being called off the waiting list. The service was superb and the mole is a MUST. Best I've had.</Text><Time>1618963381757< /Time>< Gmap_id>

<Review>I really wanted to love this place.  After all, it's a James Beard award winner, and highly recommended.  I love all sorts of ethnic foods, but now I know Oaxaca food isn't for me.

The portions are plentiful, and priced accordingly.  The Red Snapper was good, but lacked flavor.  The rice is just a pilaf.

No same day reservation, which is not good for impromptu dinners. They accomodated our large group of 11 within an hour wait.  Every person working there are so friendly and nice.</Review><Gmap_id>0x80c2b87f94d62329:0xe605cc1bb679a2ac< /Gmap_id>< user>

<Date>1621278020983<//Date><Rating>4</Rating><text>Read the article in the L.A. Times that awarded Guelaguetza the 2021 Gold award and I just had to see what all the fuss is about. It's now one of my favorite mexican restaurants ever, and certainly the best Oaxacan restaurant in L.A.

First off, you WILL get addicted to the complimentary tortillas chips with red mole and sprinkled queso fresco. It was a supremely simple dish, but what a great way to be welcomed to their moles! It also allows you to try one of their other moles for your entree if you want a broader sampling of flavors. I'd swear the red mole, with it's pronounced but not overpowering sweetness, could almost pass for a japanese curry, minus the curry spice, of course.

As an appetizer, the quesillo fundido, a gooey blend of melted Oaxaca cheese, chorizo and mushrooms, was delicious wrapped inside a warm "Kernel of Truth" brand organic corn tortilla (hands down the best corn tortillas made in L.A.). Meanwhile the chalupas--crispy tortillas with a chewy center, topped with veggies doused in a guajillo and garlic sauce--were a great, flavorful option, especially those looking for something vegetarian. Both appetizers could actually qualify as entrees too, so don't order with your eyes.

The black mole chicken breast with rice was flavorful. The mole carries everything here, as the chicken breast is boiled but otherwise unadorned except for the mole sauce. But the mole is some of the best I've had: earthy chocolate, smoky chili pepper, sweet yet also savory. Quite complex! It was a treat, and so good that I saved some of the mole to top my eggs for breakfast the next morning.

The tamale with rajas (chili pepper and chicken) was excellent as well, and I regret that I didn't order another one to go. The masa was soft, not doughy, and full of flavor, thanks to the spicy but not overwhelming filling. it's also 50% larger than the typical tamale you can find from a street vendor in L.A., and worth every penny.

The jamaica (hibiscus tea) was exceptional, with the look of red wine and a that mix of slight hibiscus tanginess and cinnamon/sugar sweetness that you expect. On the boozy side, the blended mango margarita was potent, the smokiness of the tequila is definitely the top note, with a little bit of mango in the bottom to remind you that it's not all alcohol.

The only issues we had were with service. Everyone on staff seems to have a walkie-talkie, but they seem a bit overstretched, possibly due to their popularity. Make a reservation if you have the time. If not, use the Resy app and be within 3 miles of the restaurant to have a chance of snagging a table in a reasonable amount of time (within 15-20 minutes).  Otherwise, we couldn't complain about the food. It's definitely worth it to visit Guelaguetza at least once if you're a fan of Mexican food, and essential if you want to sample the best of what Oaxacan cuisine can offer without booking a plane ticket.< /text>< Pictures>

<review>Fantastic!!!! Delicious, authentic Oaxaca food, like nothing else out there. Yes, we tried the crickets, and they were surprisingly delicious!! We also tried the moletes (sooo good), the four mole sampler (my fave was the red and the black), and a meat sampler with beef, chicken, chorizo, pork, roasted cactus, onion and jalapeño. Delicious!!! And don't forget the margaritas, as good as you would expect from a great Mexican restaurant. Highly, highly recommend. This is a new favourite and we will be back!!</review>< Rate>

<Text>DELICIOUS!!! Have to admit, the wait on a Sunday afternoon is 1 HOUR, BUT WORTH IT!!! I had the flight of the four moles, which each is a very different taste. The signature plate is the moles, do try all. Also, I had the queso fundido, the Tlayuda, and a plate of GRASSHOPPERS! VERY UNIQUE OAXCAN Restraunt. This area of LA, nothing like it. To come with an empty belly and try the moles!</Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN0-87jJ1zLtCo-Ww3Kiw7Gj16rm0_H7aYSUCiW=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOvujQiLOBvJvgKow9Wum_ONT1gnovzuGigHL6o=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO64qwUqd-gEJ_K7QPr3lLMSAGoCAERcTtAWg8n=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMVxXqowz5ivSaN_CmXhvZEpm3XA-TkL6uc2m-P=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMKll_yI-W7mDXmC4kjt2pjEm06SHpYqHS3Ty-l=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< response>

Food was good but the outdoor seating is uncomfortable, especially if you’re tall. The seats are too low.
Food was good! Meat needs more flavor and was a little dry tho<//Review>

They have a spacious parking area capable of accommodating more customers. To me, this experience is very remarkable and awesome. This is the most affordable restaurant in my city. Here, the dishes and other things are cheap. The parking area here is not a concern either. Highly recommended to everyone.</text>

I wish there were stars to give! I LOVE the Guelaguetza Restaurante (coffee) over ice. This place is not that close to me but I will happily drive 15 minutes for Restaurante from here! Super small seating area so I usually call my order ahead and pick it up. They always have it ready before I get there. They are ALWAYS busy but the service is excellent! The Chorizo breakfast burrito with salsa is my absolute favorite! Their menu is eclectic but has a good variety for all food pallets.  I'm a breakfast lover and Guelaguetza Restaurante has it all for me.<//text>

<review>This has changed so much. It's kind of like Mole Disneyland. Fewer mole recipes than I remember (granted, at the prior location and 10+ years ago). Very one-dimensional.</review><UserId.>105432346200989490067</UserId.>< name>

DELICIOUS!!! Have to admit, the wait on a Sunday afternoon is 1 HOUR, BUT WORTH IT!!! I had the flight of the four moles, which each is a very different taste. The signature plate is the moles, do try all. Also, I had the queso fundido, the Tlayuda, and a plate of GRASSHOPPERS! VERY UNIQUE OAXCAN Restraunt. This area of LA, nothing like it. To come with an empty belly and try the moles!<//review>

<review>Terrible experience. The waiting time is insane. When I arrived I was told the waiting time was an hour. I decided to wait since this it was my birthday, and this is where I go every year. After waiting for an hour, I was told there was going to be an another hour waiting this was upsetting. We spend the morning at the beach and my kids were very hungry. I just wish they would've told me the waiting time was two hrs since the beginning.
I get my three hungry kids in the car and star driving looking for something to eat, fifteen minutes into the drive I get a call that my table is ready, we drive back frantically and rushed in just to wait again. After 3 hours we are finally eating. Everyone was upset and starving, the food was delicious, the sever was great, but I didn't enjoyed my experience there.
I understand it is a struggle with an pandemic going on, but I think they should turn people away if they can't accomodate everyone instead of making people wait forever. :(<//review><name>Nancy C. Jo.<//name>< Time>

Delicious authentic mole here.  It gets packed so plan accordingly.  I purchased my food to go, and while it's a bit pricey, the serving size justifies it.</text>

One of my new favorite lunch spots! I work around the corner so it's an easy 5-7 walk. A nice little perk is they give you 15% off if you live or work in the area.

I ordered the Cocorico sandwich with fries and I enjoyed every minute of it. The chicken is tender and flavorful and the baguette was perfect as well! The sauce has quite the kick to it, so I would not order it if you are sensitive to spicy food. Thoroughly enjoyed the fries as well. You can definitely taste the quality of the food and the price point is not bad either.<//text>

<text>We really like their menu.  We had loads of Italian food during our holidays and this place was certainly the best of all. Very tasty and not expensive. The location is not far anyway. The staff was a plus, friendly and welcoming. Thank you so much for the good food that you served. We all loved it. We will be back here with my family again.</text>< Name>

<Text>Entering into this place from the heart of K-town feels like time-space travel. You go from Korea to Oaxaca all of a sudden. I’ve never entered a restaurant with such ample indoor space like this place. That alone makes it a nice go-to spot for bigger parties, even a nice date. I went on a Thursday night and they were playing live music. All the food was great, even got a chance to try some of the grasshoppers, which were honestly not as bad as I thought they were gonna be. The moles were great, I don’t have much to compare it with though. It was a little sweeter than I had imagined and reminded me of certain sweeter Indian curries. Quite a fun, unique experience overall!</Text>< Pictures>

Food was great as always, as was the service. The waiter did inform us that indoor dining will be available soon, but at first it will be 40% capacity. You know I shouldnt give them a 4 because they were told only outside seating by the crackpots in govt.

I went for my birthday because I've been in love with the food here but this time it wasn't the best. I had the "tlayuda", my favorite, but it was cold and the outer crust was really hard like it had been left out. I don't know if it sat there waiting to be taken to the table or the fact that it was outdoor dining. It was a disappointing birthday expirience, but maybe I should have ordered different.<//review>

We love Lusy's! Love that it opened now next to our work! Best place to grab lunch or even after work dinner. Food is very tasty and like home made! Also the owners are very nice and best customer service. I love the convenience too of this location. Keep in mind that fresh food takes a little longer to make and prepare so maybe order ahead if you are in a rush.<//review>

A really cute neighborhood spot - the food is great and the service is quick. The potatoes were so delicious. Fiancé and i shared a blueberry pancake that was insanely good. THE Pat sat us and checked in to make sure everything was good. She was sweet and a great host. We will definitely be back!<//Review>

Not the best Oaxacan restaurant in Los Angeles but definitely the priciest. They do have good entertainment and the food is also good. I like the twsajo and cecina. I don't really like tlayudas in general. They are like confused tostadas and it's silly to call them Mexican pizzas. Let's call pizzas: Italian tlayudas lol. The aguas frescas are good. Service is disorganized and lacking. Parking on the streets is hell but they do have a lot. Regardless of what bigwig food critics that know more about pizzas than about tlayudas say, this is not the best choice for Oaxacan food in a city with a strong Oaxacan cultural presence.< /review>

You can make a reservation but the wait is not worth the food at the end. The wait is too long to justify 2 hours+ wait.
If you do make it inside try their Mole their secret weapon.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures></record>

Save your money. This isn’t even authentic Oaxacan food first of all! They rip you off too, who the hell sells enchiladas with no chicken! Just because I’m pregnant and have been dealing with so much morning sickness I didn’t make my own mole. How embarrassing that they are representing Oaxacan food the quality is trash🤦🏻‍♀️< /Text>

<text>My boyfriend wanted to try German Food so we drove from Los Angeles, CA to try this highly rated establishment. BEWARE parking is hard and there are no big parking garages or lots like in other part of the city. After we found parking we had to wait about another half hour for our table which wasn't bad for a saturday night. We had the pretzel, the brat plate, and the meat loaf. All the meals were very good. Make sure you get a beer while you are there! It was hard to read the beer menu because there wasn't a translation on what they were. Make sure you ask your waiter for a recommendation. You won't be disappointed.
The restaurant had communal tables, so you might end up sitting with some other couples. It could be a little awkward but just remember you will be enjoying some yummy food and beer so that won't matter!</text><Resp>None< /Resp>< GmapID>

<Rating>4< /Rating><text>I always love the atmosphere here and the staff is also always so warm and hospitable ✨ I nice little reminder of Oaxaca in the heart of Los Angeles

I ordered three things on this last occasion:
A choriqueso tlayuda, mole
Rojo and an order of birria de chivo.

The choriqueso tlayuda was delicious! No complaints whatsoever. The mole on the other hand was super sweet even though it was supposed to be the one to be on the spicier side. And the order of birria was a bit disappointing simply because I got about 2 oz of meat worth 🥴

The flavor was spot on but for $17 I expected a bit more meat.

Other than that, the staff is so friendly that they make make what to come back and give it another shot.<//text>< pictures>

This place is busy for a reason. Whether you're going to the bar to have some drinks with one of their many Mezcal mixes or you're waiting for a table, the atmosphere is one to experience. Live music is a huge thumbs up. They're all about mole and you're bound to enjoy any plate you try. Get a bit creative and try making your own drink, the bartenders are willing to help.<//review>

Our friends recommended this place and it did not disappoint!! Ordered delivery via the typical apps, it was very easy. We got the mole family meal with the spare ribs and as you can see it was a mini feast! Would highly recommend this place, especially if you like mole. I could just drink it straight from the container it is so good.< /text>

<Review>Tucked up in a little corner near the Americana, you might miss it, but trust me when i say you don't want to! Delicious (and beautiful) sangria! Easily one of the best I've ever had. Nicely balanced, not overly sweet and just strong enough. For appetizers, we had the smoked salmon crostini and it was amazing!! Definitely revisiting when I'm in the area!<//Review>< response>

Im stuck between a 4 or a 5. My mom is Oaxacan and would always make mole for dinner and these reminded me so much of her cooking (although not as good obvi haha). DELICIOUS, AUTHENTIC FOOD!! The food itself is definitely 5 stars. I feel like I got the short end of the stick with service though. The staff was very friendly but not very attentive, granted they were kind of busy but they also seated us farther from other tables. It was also cold and their heaters were not working for some reason. They could also use a little more lighting on the side tables... don’t know about anyone else but I like to see my food when eating and I had to use my flashlight to be able to do that. Other than that reasonable pricing, GREAT PORTIONS, DELICIOUS FOOD AND DRINKS! Highly recommended!<//Text>

You just can't say no to any food they have been serving. All was perfect and delicious. I strongly advise this place to everyone!< /text>

I've been to the Heung Rae Gak in Koreatown a lot so I figured I'd try the one in this neighborhood. The food is great and comes in HUGE portions! Girlfriend and I ordered jjajangmyun, jjambbong, and tang su yuk. We couldn't finish everything because we were so stuffed!
Service was all around very attentive (auntie was very nice). If you're craving Chinese food, definitely recommend this restaurant!< /Text>

This is one of the top rated mexican restaurants in Los Angeles. This is not your average Mexican fare, originates from Oaxaca. Any average assumption you may have of Mexican, this is totally outside the box. I would highly suggest to almost anyone. With friends, family, kid-friendly, drinks, foods on happy hour. The only reasoning for the 4 star is that our particular waiter was not the friendliest but the other staff members were courteous and welcoming.< /text>

This location is in Korea Town, outdoor dining because of covid-19. Delicious mole... I tried the Fiesta moles, it was great. The Queso fundido is so good. Ladies bathroom needs improvement. Great staff!!<//Text>

I don't  think this is the moment to eat at this place outside  the place and tables are terrible  and the service is bad. We was seating  for like 20 min and nobody  went  to us until we call somebody  and the food it wasn't  that same, so we gotta wait until  they open inside,<//Review>

On a hot day we stopped in here for lunch. Most of the food is ready to serve where you walk up to the counter and pick out what you want. A server helps you fill your cafeteria tray and then you pay for the food and drink that you have selected. Both levels of the restaurant are air-conditioned.< /Review>

We had the mole rojo with pork short ribs, and the portion is enormous, easily enough for three people. The takeaway order included a generous serve of tortillas and chips. Everything was delicious and the pork was so soft and succulent! Service was speedy and super friendly. I highly recommend this place for Oaxaqueno food!< /text>

Amazing mole, great unhurried service. highly recommended, authentic vibe and ambiance ( read not trendy or modern). 4.9⭐️. Live music. Truly a great place, and has

I tried the mole flight and then the mole with chicken, moist, fall of the bone. Probably the best mole I have tried outside Mexico.< /Text>

<text>I had a mole experience like the one I had when I went on my honeymoon in Oaxaca! Also the service was excellent and hospitable. I think the only thing that needs some retooling are the cocktails and maybe the prices. A little to pricey for mole.</text>< userid>

<Rate>5</Rate><text>I came to try this restaurant on a Sunday a little after noon and was surprised when I walked inside. Immediately the atmosphere changed and was greeted by some great live music and a full house of people all seeming to have a great time. I walked up to the counter and and informed them I was there for the first time, the young lady at the counter informed my party of 5 that it would be about a 45 minute wait.

Normally I wouldn't have waited at a restaurant that I hadn't previously researched to see if it was worth the wait, but this restaurant was different so I took my chances and decided to wait.

BEST DECISION EVER

The food was fantastic! Large portions and a great presentation of the food followed by  stellar service by our server.

The price matches what you are paying for in my opinion, so if you are ever looking to try Oaxacan cuisine or try some new Mexican food come check this place out! You will NOT be disappointed I can assure you that.<//text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPgulOsQAjqg-PBOWMeJDGzlv0SVVI0_FGzmfP4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMf69JjDCLOB1Y4JNnzERe27SZQd9aoIDi2n7gp=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOHKsJxAUsyq0SHrxtveOeFVjcw-1ByoR_Se6lz=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPlNQFSf27p_pwmdZqUVbo4D13vMinXhOw3VFoH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM2THtJ9sNx4FKRXSCRz5dWf4Ceg1K-whKqHgaN=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNE1RKyCeyODFqj7E0aRavq1bkmULm8UFdd_7Pf=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< response>

He ordered a fish taco and the flavor wasn't the same, although it looked good. A little too much and too much mixture on the plate that covers and emalgamates all other flavours!!</Text>

Lusy's Mediterranean cafe is a Little Mediterranean joint serving up some great flavors! I tried the lentil soup and chicken noodle both were fabulous . The baklava is stuff of legends. The service was great the restaurant had a comfortable vibe . Definitely check them out if you have the time !! :)< /text>

If you love mole this is the place for you.. for appetizer they give you chips with mole on top- that was Delicious! Make sure to get a reservation or go early in the morning. Minimum waiting time without a reservation is 40 min to an hour.< /review>

<Review>Ok. Simply amazing. We walked in just in time to have availability to sit. I highly recommend reservations because it's a smaller place. It felt very authentic and even our waiter had a really strong accent. You can feel the bones and history in this spot. Our waiter recommended the lasagna without hesitation so I know I had to try it. Hands down best lasagna ever!</Review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

<text>What a great foodie spot! This is a must try if you are in the LA area. Get there early because it gets packed. Brunch specials on Saturday. I would definitely recommend this if you want authentic Mexican food. The mole is on point.   Also, the handmade tortillas are fire! Will be going back soon!< /text>< response>

<Text>This place is worth all the hype. Brunch is an American art form that many places do well, but Cafe De Olla rises above most. The pancakes, waffles, and omelettes are on point, but their Mexican specialties (and especially anything done "poblano" style), are the real gems. Their coffee is hype as well. Don't miss this Burbank classic!</Text>< pictures>

< Review>
The festival of moles is absolutely a must! You get a delicious taste of each savory mole. Guacamole was fresh, spicy & oh so hood. Also if you're a willing to try it, the cricket plate is quite tasty. Service was very good, friendly, fairly quick considering how busy they were. I strongly recommend reservations to avoid the long wait of those who just walk in. My only critique is that the lighting is a bit dim to read the smaller description of the dishes on the menu and the bill. Many were using their cell phones to light these items up. Otherwise, definitely will eat there again!</Review>

All of the menu items are really fresh.
I've had authentic Mexican food in Guadalajara and this place comes pretty close.
Their tacos come with fresh salsa, avocado and other fresh condiments.

The food was not what we expected with authenticity; and trust, I’ve traveled worldwide tasting Mexican food. But the customer service was authentic and amazing from GM Alejandro. I will go back just because the customer service was unlike anything I’ve seen before in a restaurant.</Review>

<review>HOLY MOLE.

Too easy. This place has been on my radar for a while. It's been on many top 10 lists and it's been on Travel Channel and Food Network. My biggest fear for this was that it might have been over hyped.

The wait was long but waiting at the bar was a fun experience.  All the staff are accommodating and very nice. The restaurant itself is the perfect atmosphere for live music, good food, and family meals.

So how was the food??? I can honestly say it exceeded all of my expectations! We got the family meal because there were 16 of us, but there was more than enough food to go around. Get the MOLE Flight. Four different kinds of mole and every one of them flavorful and savory.

I'll be back for seconds!

Enjoy your Mole!</review>< Pictures>

<pictures>None</pictures><Text>I am usually here at least twice a year. I order the vegetarian red curry - always made fresh, hot, and perfect quantity for lunch. They get packed during lunch and dinner hours so I would highly recommend reserving tables. They have a few really delicious vegetarian options, and all my non-veg friends love the place. Definitely coming back with a friend who's visiting SF!

<Text>Food was good.  The grasshoppers were interesting.  The horchata was amazing.  The place was packed, but the wait wasn't as long as I feared since they had so many tables.  The live music was very nice and added to the atmosphere.  The wall art and the lights everywhere made the mood very festive and nice.  The restaurant exterior is very interesting as the place used to be a Korean buffet and retains the traditional roof.  It has a tree in the middle with lights adding to the cool interior feeling.  The hot chocolate in milk was delicious.< /Text><Time>1546745344740< /Time><userid>114717889345530623495</userid><Gmap_id>0x80c2b87f94d62329:0xe605cc1bb679a2ac</Gmap_id><resp>None< /resp><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN1tTCMYjq1miNU6vxkJ1gXTeOY_H-AcSNzQuh8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNXjvK8n8rf1S4S09BdzvQ6PqRe3hWI9clf3qW7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNUgEHzCsQid8wJa4o-5Q9AYUd73zdLNSsVEaJw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP3ZFdQ0tfe06eQA4nIlM_l_p_0R3mO-LLEUJD9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNXH3CnEJCRZCAhacfuMNnsYgDr2b2vYgMe-1wB=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNNmoRe0OfcPCaD3Ohs2lFWPMdMnwZP7p0aFj4D=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMhkyEX6PMXSMv15T9iUi4C4KJguZ4JKSsngB_9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics>< name>

These are the masters of mole and barbacoa, where you can taste smoke and sesame, chocolate and chiles in every bite. Best part: socially distanced outdoor patio featuring homemade misting fans. That’s right, the old hack with an ice bucket evaporating under a table fan.<//Review>

It's over priced. The customer service was horrible this last time ( dec 2020). The lady who took out order was rude and had no intentions on answering my questions when I was placing my order. She rushed me to place my order. I had gone to this place once before ( sep 2019) and the customer service was better but still over priced.</text>

<review>I can understand why some people wouldn’t give it 5 Stars but this is my rating because it is a very unique restaurant. The food is pretty good, the bar is awesome, the service is friendly and the environment is fun. It is not cheap but if you are looking for a  satisfying meal, a few drinks, and a good time this is a great place. Keep in mind that It can get loud. I probably wouldn’t go here just to eat, I go for the whole experience.< /review>< user_name>

Our waiter deserves this review. He gave us a recommendations and really took care of us. He was attentive and very kind. The passion fruit shots he made us were so amazing. I was very impressed. The service and drinks were great. Put this one on the list.<//text>

<review>Best mole I ever had! I been here couple times and it is worth the wait. If you can tho, make reservations which they need to be 2wks in advance. Las enchiladas are to die for, highly recommend them. Very friendly and helpful staff. I hope you enjoy it as much I did.</review>< rating>

<text>The ideal place for a taste of the city's range of food. They have mustard, relish, celery salt, onions, tomatoes, pickle and sport peppers piled onto a poppy seed bun, of course, the reviewer favorite. The taste is really addictive and it is worth paying for. I will highly recommend this place to everyone.<//text><Resp>None<//Resp>< rating>

When it's Friday and the wife and I feel like a cocktail or three (which is every Friday) and some Chinese Food - It's up to TheGuelaguetza Restaurante!
Our SOP is to plant ourselves at the bar (which has a Happy Hour from 5pm to Close), graze through the extensive and excellent appetizer menu, and throw back several drinks.  The service and food is spot on - with Josh being our bartender of choice!
It gets the weekend off to a wonderful start...< /review>

A patio dining experience worth trying with friends and or family.  The food prices are a little bit higher than other restaurants like this,  I can only assume that it's because the pandemic but then again we can always show a little support,.. enjoy<//Text>

We have gone several times and the food never disappoints!
All of the menu items are really fresh.
I've had authentic Mexican food in Guadalajara and this place comes pretty close.
Their tacos come with fresh salsa, avocado and other fresh condiments.
I'd definitely come back!</review>

Fresh, creamy & delicious guacamole at @guelaguetzarestaurant I have to say; one of THE best guacs I’ve ever had, and I’ve had a lot of guacs! The menu did not have any vegan entrees BUT the wait staff was so friendly & knowledgable that they went out of their way to assist me in veganizing a dish. They were so accommodating & understanding, they really made me feel welcome. As fellow vegans know; not all restaurants are good at making us feel like we are not a burden. Although the menu is not vegan friendly, I give them 5 ⭐️ for being so accommodating & respectful. 💚💚💚 #guelaguetza #guelaguetza2019 #guacamole #guac #avocado #vegantravels #veganlife #respectvegan<//Text>

This was our first time trying Guelaguetza Restaurante. This seemed to be a very happening place. It was very crowded. Sunday night and it took 50 minutes to get a table .....well worth it.</Review>

Went here with two girlfriends and got a few items to share. Right when we walked in the place blew me away! It had the cutest decor and ambience was amazing for evening dinner. A little on the pricier side but well worth it, the staff is super friendly ill be back soon!<//text>

The service took long, our drinks were cold (chocolate) there was a long hair wrapped in my utensils, our food took 30 min to come out, the chilaquiles were cold, overpriced for the type of food and service they provided, won't be back to this place definately.< /text>

< Review>
We went here because we heard people talking about it everywhere. We passed a couple of times when we were out in LA but did not stop by but it was like that every time. We decided to go inside to see what they sold and waited for the time it was. The only bad thing here is the wait time. They have valet service and that helps but only if there actually is parking. We got the traditional red mole with chicken and the nachos that they gave us while we waited where from the same mole. Honestly, the service size is always large and I always end up taking about half home. I have had the meat dish and that was also really good.< /Review>

<Review>Mole olé!

One of L.A.’s iconic Mexican restaurants with a wide variety of Oaxacan moles. Come for Happy Hour if you are budget conscious — with special deals for drinks and appetizers.

Portions are ample and the staff is very friendly. Parking is limited, especially during live music events.</Review><user_name>iNSIDE EUROPE< /user_name><user_id>110415856906012240271< /user_id><response>None< /response><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNNijTXJ9EzEjr3PHngawf3AczXJF1bRfeDtjnM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNCyTEIrtO8aLfxwQQHUww4k1FH8Y1EtHaXGMDL=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN9LK2xLaiAbU5BXy8lIazVOouIiCu9A7csaZ9p=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOTwAXmC5xsLWwGAfJ5bBM76rPP0mg5djRdrh70=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOgzOCKpDTtXu2YOcEkJ_xvYJQGH4c7gWCB3pDa=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipODvM-XOVsmS-4bIbUwj5E-mjO4W93ZUuJr8k3r=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOW7h0jHP32UNMLC-FJfsASkdV0nMJTN-OhVHHx=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOmM_b02gVQAxmUhwM4yVkeu7EDPVq8Pm0XlLC9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMDnvWt7CNB5pJp6L2bfo6OfPTcJ6KeJbtGT7BM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMlFYVjbdLCvGonRNyEbDJoY7NxX2iZ1oP_q-9e=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMPy2LKlrOEldND8p2iylccwwBddAuB3BIEyWwi=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics><Rate>4<//Rate></record></dataset><record>

Great food for a great price. The Panuchos are the best thing on the menu. Nice casual vibe, good place to stop with a friend for lunch, or a just grab quick bite for dinner on your own (takeout holds up too.< /Text>

<review>My family and I have been coming here for years. Eder the manager has always treated us like family. The food the drinks the music! It's always something I look forward to with excitement. Perfect for a family night. Or the bar section for a girls night. The live band on Friday nights has always been my favorite.< /review>< gmapID>

They have a valet parking lot next to the restaurant, no self parking. We found a parking spot on the road in front of the restaurant. We arrived around 6pm and there was no wait. The waiter was very helpful and knowledgeable. The service  was outstanding. The food was very good,.< /review>

<Text>If you live in Los Angeles or are visiting you need to eat here. Probably one of the best Mexican food in all of Los Angeles. The moles are finger licking delicious along with many other Oaxacan specialties. The staff is so incredibly kind and welcoming that they make your visit that much better. I always look forward to eating here and highly recommend it.< /Text><UserId.>114872306102711763402< /UserId.><Resp>None</Resp><time>1578094324998< /time>< Pics>

<Resp>None<//Resp><Text>Everything was great, food was delicious, parking (valet) was easy, luckily no wait time, unfortunately they were so busy that they brought the appetizers with dinner, and when they did they forgot the plates to share, we bought one of those huge parrilladas, and they did not offer to refill the drinks. They were so busy that we had like 3 or 4 different waiters and the restrooms were a disaster. The ladies at the register did not offer help at their little store by the entrance.< /Text><date>1574835417462< /date><Rate>3< /Rate><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO4nme_UpOExo4kmBBYEHkMPFoDc8d1HB23PUXY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO3y2MPa5o88kfdKovkiUxOdvCfCunLAtK0q0C-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPpCHoTnaOpThpV28NlU8QoyqnP8nA2Ub-M_zM9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures><GmapID>0x80c2b87f94d62329:0xe605cc1bb679a2ac</GmapID></record>

< review>
I am ashamed to discover I've never written a review for Guelaguetza before today. This place is one of the first big discoveries I made when I moved to LA. I came here for the first time with my parents when they visited me a few months after I've moved to LA.

Since then, I've been back multiple times, always bringing different friends to check this place out!

The restaurant doesn't have windows on the outside of the building, so from the outside driving past on an ugly stretch of Olympic, you wouldn't know how beautiful it is inside. There's a stage where they have live music every night and so many tables. Their kitchen/grill area is open so you can watch the food being prepped. They also have a bar with tvs if you want to watch a game.

I always get the chilaquiles and the tlayuda when I come here. The chilaquiles are the best I've ever had - the sauce they use has me licking the plate. Their mole is also outstanding! When you first sit down, they will bring a small basket of chips covered in a sauce with an incredible depth of flavor.  I could eat only that and be happy.

Their menu is pretty extensive - great for breakfast, lunch or dinner. And their cocktail list is also incredible! Very fun selection of creative drinks.

Street parking when I drove was easy, but I came mid morning on a weekday. I imagine it's a lot tougher on the weekend/in the evening because it's right in KTown. I often walk here since I live close enough.

Highly recommend this place! Truly makes a lasting impression.</review>

I came here with my Girlfriends to grab dinner. The menu has a little bit of everything. The food looked whatever and my friend found hair in her mushroom ravioli. Our server was super nice and attentive. I doubt I'll go back.< /Text>

Hands down they have the best Mole in L.A ❤️

Service is friendly not the best. The only reason why I gave it 4 stars was simply because the food is absolutely delicious.

Perks: They have a live band almost every night. 🎶

Restaurant is clean the restroom needs more maintenance.<//text>

<text>The chips come drizzled with the best mole we have ever tasted.  Perfect balance of sweetness.  We had four dishes to share.  First we shared a Memela.  It was the perfect appetizer.  Nicely layered with beans and a generous portion of queso Oaxaca.  Delicious.  We also ordered fried pork ribs in tomato sauce, barbacoa de chivo, and an enmolada.  All items were fantastic, great flavor and uniquely oaxacan.  Dropped a star, the waiter did not enjoy waiting.  He acted annoyed when questions where asked or items were requested.  The horchata was good but not particularly one of the best.<//text></record>

<text>We went here because we heard people talking about it everywhere. We passed a couple of times when we were out in LA but did not stop by but it was like that every time. We decided to go inside to see what they sold and waited for the time it was. The only bad thing here is the wait time. They have valet service and that helps but only if there actually is parking. We got the traditional red mole with chicken and the nachos that they gave us while we waited where from the same mole. Honestly, the service size is always large and I always end up taking about half home. I have had the meat dish and that was also really good.< /text>< Gmap_id>

I feel like my first memory of this place must have been fuzzy. I remember going here years ago and having a better experience with the atmosphere and food. I went back again recently and it was really just an OK experience. The wait staff was very accommodating when I wanted to move away from the live band so I could actually talk to my companion. Speed in which food came out was good as well. Unfortunately, the food was really just average (ordered the red mole chicken enchiladas. Chicken was incredibly dry). I also don't remember the restaurant being quite so dark. After requesting to change seats because the band was too loud, I again had to request a seat change because the lights were so dim that I couldn't read the menu. Would I come back again? Maybe. I'm hoping my most recent experience was just a fluke.<//Text>

<Text>I was expecting the food to be Great since alot of people gave it 5 stars. The mole was the only plate that taste good . I order a plate for my son from the kids menu and the chicken was super hard and no  flavor to it. The place is clean and customer service was good . They also had a band playing . Look for parking in the main street on Olympic . They have valet parking in the back of the restaurant however it gets full quickly. Do not try to enter through the front doors on Olympic you need enter the restaurant through the back .<//Text>< pics>

Tough to choose the best mole in town but Guelaguetza might have the title, especially since Moles la Tia seems to be closed. It's so rich and memorable. Even my mole burps taste good. The barbacoa de chivo rules too.< /text>

Right smack in the middle of 8th street! Convenience isn't the only pro for this great tasting spot. The combo items deliver the opportunity to try several items without busting your budget. Combo item #2 (that's the actual name) includes around 5 different Mexican delicacies all around $15!<//Text>

This place has some great food and live music later in the evening. They serve you chips with mole which is so delicious you can’t stop eating it. I had some fried crickets for the first time. I hated them but my family loved them. The bar makes top of the line drinks. Parking is 5 dollars but it’s valet.<//Review>

This is the spot!! It's extremely busy, sometimes a little rusty, but the food is good!!! They have amazing burritos, their Prawn salads are everything in life, their salsa is good and delicious. Please give this historic spot in Los Angeles a try.If you like Guelaguetza Restaurante , you will love this place.Their prawn plates are good. I just tell them no lettuce on my burrito.< /Text>

Get the mole style with all four mole sauces. Amazing flavors and tastes. One of the people in our party described it as "like grandma made"!< /text>

<text>Great food, terrible service. The server took 30 minutes to bring us our drinks and took forever to even come to our table to greet us. He was more worried about his group of friends on the other table. Also, the bill was very high and came to realize the server was charging me two margaritas, when I told him about it he got all nervous as if he did it on purpose.< /text><response>None<//response><username>Stephanie Rodriguez</username><Pics>None< /Pics>< Rate>

Really good quality food.  We tried chapulines (grasshoppers) they were delicious 😋.  Tlayulas are really good too. Oxacan food is a league of its own, very different than what many people considered Mexican food.</text>

Had been wanting to try the original restaurant and was disappointed that it was closed but when I found out the same owners opened this new restaurant I was excited to try it. Was not disappointed and highly recommend this authentic Mexican restaurant. I had the shrimp in garlic sauce and my husband had the whole grilled fish. We also tried the mole sampler appetizer and I know we'll be ordering mole next time. Drinks were extra good, horchata has a good unique taste.</text>

<rating>1< /rating><review>Food came out cold, the steak was tough, we waited for 1 hour for this food. Complained to the manager and she tried to start an argument.

The waiter started off by pushing us to order, it was a Saturday night so we understand why, still not a good way to start but he was kind so it wasn't a bother. Then the food came out, on average each a plate cost 20$, so when we felt and tasted this old and frozen food after waiting an hour we were beyond furious. The food was not edible. We asked to speak to the manager instead the supervisor came out to talk with us. He was polite and attentive, and overall understood that they failed us as a restaurant. The part that really makes me furious is that after we talked with the supervisor, the manager rushed over to us and want to start an argument. We told her what was wrong and directly started to go against what we all just felt and tasted. She had a horrible attitude and we told her we would not argue and then she backed down. This is the type of restaurant to give you horrendous service and expect you to pay for all the food.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None< /response><gmapID>0x80c2b87f94d62329:0xe605cc1bb679a2ac<//gmapID></record>

Food is delicious, very authentic from Oaxaca, try the fried grasshoppers a la Mexicana appetizer.  Highly recommend their different flavors of horchata waters. If you get a chance visit their bar, great Mezcal drinks, try the Garras de Tigre and their mezcal margaritas.  Bartenders are very friendly.</Text>

Mimosas are $19 w the purchase of any food item which is definitely worth it

Atmosphere: small, great for a fun time on Sunday, the DJ was amazing and gave free shots to my party
Staff: all staff was amazing and very attentive, gave us the corner what seems to be a VIP area since we had a party of 10+

Tips: go early, make reservations if its a large party, bring comfortable clothing it does get hot, go on Sunday the DJ rocks

Return: yes!<//Review>< Pictures>

Live music, fun atmosphere, and great food and service. The Botana is sizzling plate of meats, cactus, onions and more. 4 or 5 people can easily be satisfied by a half order and costs only around $60. The horchata is delicious and looks very fancy in the glass. I highly recommend reservations, this place is usually packed. All of the staff were extremely friendly during our visit and we will for sure be returning.< /Review>

<Review>Restaurant is super loud, it’s definitely hard to hear each other at the table (and we sat towards the back. you’ll be deaf if you’re next to the stage where music is being performed).

Arrived at 6:30pm for dinner on Saturday night and the wait was about 30-40 min. You  can sign up on the Yelp waitlist and save a place in line before you get there to reduce the time spent waiting outside there.

Service is suuuper slow but the wait staff is friendly. When we asked which mole was good, we were brought a sampler to try all of them! Mole is fantastic, although I don’t like the corn-based ones quite as much (too starchy). The enchiladas come COVERED in mole and are very salty. Horchata here is amazing, the cactus fruit really changes the game. For the tamale, you can pass on adding rice + beans (both are just eh)< /Review><time>1568038822598<//time>< gmapID>

Very nice place.  Mexican traditional food spot.  The prices of the dishes are equivalent to the good quality of the food.  Great drinks.  It has paid parking.  Payment can be made by credit card or cash.  The place is a little piece of Mexico in Los Angeles.<//review>

<text>Food is good but waiter got our order wrong.  We tried telling him several times but it was so loud in the restaurant and he was so insistent of his understanding it was lost on him.  The tortillas were stale.

Great crowd and ambience.  Just didn't have the best experience.</text>< Rate>

Horrible. No parking. Drove two hours to try this place and the "valet" staff doesn't know how to effectively park cars to accommodate more vehicles. I asked if they could make more room for my car (which there was plenty of space) and they carelessly refused. Not even any public parking anywhere near. Don't waste your time. There are two other authentic Oaxacan restaurants less than a mile away with adequate parking.</review>

<Text>What can you say about Guelaguetza that isn't common knowledge? It's a LA landmark! Mole, fundito, thalyudas and micheladas. If you haven't been, you gotta try it. I love the fact they had a stand for our infant car seat, too. Much appreciated.<//Text><userid>106721233996858643092</userid>< GmapID>

<Review>After watching a TV show where the characters ate Grasshopper tacos, I was determined to find and eat grasshoppers in LA. After searching the internet and reading a multitude of (excellent) reviews, I discovered that Guelaguetza was the place to go to eat grasshoppers. They offer them cooked two different ways on their appetizer menu and I chose to go with "Mexican" style with onions, tomatoes and jalapeño peppers. It was delicious and absolutely fun to eat. I chose the chicken tamale with black mole sauce as my entree and I have to say, it was the best chicken tamale I have ever had in my life. First of all, the portion was HUGE and I feel like there was the meat of an entire chicken stuffed in that thing. The mole sauce had such an amazing depth of flavors that I couldn't even begin to explain. My friend got the goat stew and it was a tiny bit too spicy for me. I washed it all down with a house horchata. The night that I went, they had live music which only enhanced the entire experience. This was my first experience eating Mexican food in LA and I am so happy that I literally went to the best Mexican place in LA for that experience. They have a great gift shop with an assortment of their sauces available for purchase in glass jars as well as Mexican themed gifts. The decor was absolutely beautiful and I enjoyed every moment. There is on site valet parking for a nominal fee (I'm sorry, I don't remember how much it was)

They have mezcal tasting and I totally want to go back for more grasshoppers and a sampling of mezcal served in tiny gourds. Everything was amazing and they have the pretty angel wings all over the exterior wall for your instagramming pleasure. Reservations recommended.< /Review><user>102061448495910822318< /user>< Rating>

Love the live music and vibe of this place. Started with the Horchata Con Tuna Y Nuez and I never want to order horchata anywhere else. It wasn't too sweet, so delicious, and loved the texture from the toppings. We also ordered the Festival de Moles, it looks kind of small when you get it, but turned out to be more than enough since I also got to take it home for another meal.<//Review>

Fog harbor fish house, what can I say about this 5 star seafood gem on Pier 39?  I think I can say plenty.

Fog Harbor is on the second level of Pier 39, I visited this weekend on a touristy trip to San Francisco.  I chose FH due to the Yelp reviews I read prior to traveling to San Francisco.< /Review>

With any new restaurant you expect kinks and that's what we got. It did not, however, affect our experience in the slightest. My husband and I have been waiting for this place to reopen we're quite familiar with the owners reputation in Bell Gardens and Maywood. The place is very beautiful on the inside. It's colorful and the staff is friendly.< /review>

Our experience was great! The food is authentic Oaxacan/Mexican and tons of varieties of Mezcal and tequila. I always get the guelaguetza tlayuda 😀. Plus the atmosphere is excellent! Live music too 🎶 and the service is great too 👍🏽< /text>

<resp>None<//resp><Review>The people were friendly and the food was fine. The mole was pretty good. The mole on the chips you get is very good, even.
When we first came here it was a Friday night and it was very cold outside. We didn't have a reservation and there was a two hour wait (!!!). We came back on a Wednesday, with a reservation. Would the food have been worth the two hour wait? Not for me.
When we were there, there was a band playing live music. The music was a bit loud; my boyfriend and I couldn't talk over the music. They took a break only after we finished our meals and were leaving the restaurant.
For us, it was an underwhelming experience. It wasn't bad, not by a long shot. It just wasn't as great an experience as we had expected.</Review>< time>

This place has some great food and live music later in the evening. They serve you chips with mole which is so delicious you can’t stop eating it. I had some fried crickets for the first time. I hated them but my family loved them. The bar makes top of the line drinks. Parking is 5 dollars but it’s valet.< /Text>

Can’t say enough good things about this place.
Everything we tried was on point.
Went here for a friends birthday dinner and she loved it as well.

Atmosphere: 10/10 live music playing ✅, courteous customer service ✅, wait not to long✅ that mean enough seating capacity,
Wait staff knowledgeable and helpful✅.

Food: It’s a oaxacan specialty restaurant, and they have the most amazing Mole I have tasted north of the border. Server bought me a sample of all there mole preparation with chips. They were all amazing, I chose the roja mole.
The chicken in the mole was fall of the bone melt in your mouth. All of us were surprised as to how good it was.
Other food ordered: pozolle, one Tlayuda, mecheladas and a tres leeches (which was on the house coZ of the birthday girl).
Everything was really good.

I would definitely return next time I am in LA.

<review>We ordered takeout as they were closing yesterday, and they were nice enough to allow me to order with only a few minutes left to spare.

My bf and his brother had been here to eat, but I never got the chance to actually go there and eat with them.
They usually order grasshoppers. I thought I would try one just to do it, but it's a little too gnarly for me. I heard they were spicy and they give you quite the plethora!

I ordered the family mole. We got red and coloradito. OH MY GOSH! It is delicious!!!
I didn't know what to expect, but when I tasted it...I would say it is Mexican curry!

Took 15 min to prepare my order, I picked it up.
I got it with chicken and they gave us four breasts. I thought dark meat would be included, but maybe not? Maybe they ran out.

Came with black beans, rice, corn tortillas, 2 moles, 4 breasts = $65 with tip.
The only thing that was missing was the Oaxaca cheese! I thought it came with it! Guess not?

No worries, I went to Ralphs and picked up a round of Oaxaca. Perfect!

Back on that mole though. YUMMMM!!!! WOW that's good!</review><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None<//Resp><Gmap_id>0x80c2b87f94d62329:0xe605cc1bb679a2ac<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Place has been my favorite restaurant to visit for over 13 years now. Living in NYC now I don’t get there more than once or twice a year. It never disappoints.
Unfortunately the crowd changes and the folks fighting over precious bar seats get pathetic and absurd. But that’s typical I suppose of a popular destination.</Review>

This place is a gem. I'd driven past before without really noticing but the interior is bright and fun and lovely. You pretty much have to try one of the moles if you come here, and they have several kinds. I love the chips with the red mole sauce they bring out! I've only ever been for lunch but I'm told they have live music at night.< /text>

Then, I talked it up so much that my bosses got me a gift card as a thank you gift. Both times were wonderful experiences. And let's just be real: it's all about the mole. They know how to make it, and we love it. Both times we have ordered the Festival of Moles and another big platter of meat and vegetables, and they've been great together. Maybe next time we'll order something else to go with our mole, but maybe not. The service is great: friendly, welcoming, and not at all pretentious. The decor is just right. And the Live music is great. Just be warned: this place is busy on Saturday nights. I recommend getting here early to beat the rush.</review>< pictures>

<Time>1597867854404<//Time><rate>1<//rate><Text>I searched for the best Oaxacan food in Los Angeles and found Guelaguetza Restaurante on several lists, but had an overall bad experience from the service to the dish. I came to the front and we were told to order inside for takeout. The cashier takes my girlfriend's order first and then while taking my order, she walks away while I was in the middle of talking. No one called her over or anything, she just walked away. After a minute, another lady comes over to finish our orders and I asked if she could repeat back what was entered for my order to make sure the previous lady entered it correctly. The second lady gave me some attitude after I just asked for  some clarification. After we received our food and we left the restaurant, we noticed she didn't give us any utensils. This is my fault for not checking, but I assumed because we ordered takeout that we would receive two sets of utensils. The food I ordered, Enfrijoladas with handmade tortillas and chorizo asado, didn't have handmade tortillas. Unfortunately, the chorizo was also not fully cooked as I had two symptoms of food poisoning soon after eating it. I am still feeling stomach cramps and general discomfort in the morning after.<//Text><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None< /resp><gmap_id>0x80c2b87f94d62329:0xe605cc1bb679a2ac</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Great authentic food! One of the best customer services i have experienced.  Only thing is if you love spicy food like me, you'll notice their spicy food isn't that spicy but its good. It is pricey but it's worth it.<//Review>

Food is tasty and portions are a good size. Only complaint is that it has become a tourist hot spot, get there early. And whats up with parking, I always forget and get annoyed when I get there and remember about parking.< /Review>

<Review>I wont lie the chicken is pretty decent, even though the wings get smaller and smaller each time it seems. However I seriously don't like or appreciate the young korean people working there. They are always very blank and expressionless and dont have a problem shooing you out of the restaurant when its still over an hour before their posted closing time. Their manners and demeanor to customers are always very short and rude, particularly the chubby younger guy with the fishbowl haircut. Cheer up dude, or go to the DMV to work. Ive noticed this not just with me but with others in line, same bad service. Good food, but work on your service. Not the greatest ive had. Spend your money on Sun nong Dan where the people smile sometimes.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

<text>Food is a solid 5 stars. Every dish is amazing.

Service is at 1 star. Our drinks ran out, we weren't asked if we wanted something else to drink. When the food (slightly cool) arrived I asked for another drink which didn't arrive until after we finished eating. Table to our right had a similar experience cuz their drinks were empty as well. Table to our left had their food arrive but then it was forgotten before being given to the hungry people. They were left starting at their food for a good 10-15 minutes before it was served. By the time their food was distributed it was cold.

I recommend takeout when you feel like eating at Guelaguetza< /text><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

You can't miss the mural with the little girl holding the corn while the boy tries grabbing a hen. Stepping inside the smell is great, the decor is traditional, and the live music with the xylophone pulls everything together. The food and drinks are amazing, the service is quick and friendly. There's valet at charge so there's no trouble looking for parking. Excellent Oaxacan restaurant!</review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

I agree with the other reviewer regarding the exterior.   We sat in the parking lot wondering if they were really open.   It is neat, clean and inviting inside.

<text>First time here and it lived up to the hype. Servings were larger than we expected. Mole variety was superb. I typically don't order mole when out to eat because it never tastes very good to me. But that was not the case here - try them all and bets are you will like at least one, if not all! Service was fast and the staff was friendly. Our server, Edar (spelling??), was unbelievably knowledgeable, from the food's origin to how the dishes are prepared. We were beyond satisfied and will definitely return!</text><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< gmapID>

<user_name>Jessamine Kelley<//user_name><text>Went for dinner on a Saturday around 7. Very loud, dark and crowded, they told us it was a 45-min to 1 hour wait, so we gave them our number and walked to a bar nearby. They texted about 10 minutes after we left, way sooner than expected. We scrambled to chug our drinks and pay, then ran back to the restaurant. When we got there they told us we were too late, so we waited another 20 minutes and finally got a table. There was a band playing so loud we couldn’t hear each other, so conversation was stunted. The mole was way too sweet and prices were incredibly high for unremarkable food. We ordered the margarita happy hour special, but were charged full price and had to argue about the bill, but they fixed it. Not a great experience.<//text>< Rating>

< Review>
This was freaking DELICIOUS! We started with the "pizza" dish, sorry forgot what it's called 😣. Had the three meat one.

The order: fish fillet in a mole sauce, spicy, very good. The empanada, and I'm used to the little tiny half shell ones, this was biiiiiiig, very tasty. Baked chicken, yummy. The pina coladas hit the spot.

The atmosphere was great, live music, cheerful personnel.  This place was full of life.

Will most definitely be back.< /Review>

<text>The wait here is a little long but it’s totally worth it. The service was great and quick. The food didn’t take too long to arrive to our table. Great selection of moles and the taste of them are amazing. The horchata was great tasting, full of flavors. They have a live band which is hard to find restaurants now that have love bands. Totally worth going to go see. They don’t have parking but they have valet.</text>< pics>

I have my favorite Italian restaurants in LA (The Sit Down & Osteria La Buca), but I was looking for a casual spot that I can go to when I'm craving pasta. My sister found La Pergoletta and we decided to give it a try on Saturday night.< /Review>

Was really excited to visit this birthplace of Oaxacan cuisine in the US. Mole was the best I've ever had, and the Mezcal selection was truly top notch. Try the fried crickets.</text>

Great tasty & delicious dishes!

I've been a fan of LA Guelaguetza food for a very long time, I was introduced by a friend of mine to this place ore than 15 years ago, and let me tell you the good flavors and quality of food remains at its highest. If you are familiar with Mexican food but specially from Oaxaca you'll know that they have many different dishes, from their famous Coloradito Enchiladad, their Tlayudas, Tamales, Birria, you'll have to dine   every night for a month in order to try all the delicious dishes that they have.

For the record I'm not being compensated for this review I just love their food.

They have (or used to have) another location in Lynwood by Plaza Mexico I'm not sure if it still exist.

- Be prepare to wait a little since this place gets packed on weekends.

Possibly,  the best Oaxacan restaurant West of the Mississippi.  Service is perfect, fun atmosphere, and delicious food. Great selection of drinks and spirits. FYI make sure to bring cash for parking. Its mandatory valet parking, unless you get lucky and find parking on the street.< /text>

<review>Love that they have a selection of 4 moles (Festival de moles). They are known for their black oaxacan mole but I thoroughly enjoyed the red mole due to the added level of mild spice. The coloradito had a mild sweetness and very mild spice level that I enjoyed as well. We ordered an app of quesillo and chorizo but honestly would have been more than full with just the moles due to the large portions. Also the hot chocolate was worth ordering again.< /review>< Pics>

Holy Meat Heaven!!! Went here with some work buddies (group of chefs) and we were blown away! Everything we ate delicious and we got a lot of food. My only criticism is there was at least another 4 person meal's worth of food that we couldn't order because we stood no chance of finishing it. I'm kidding of course, that's not a criticism, it just means we will have a tough time deciding: Do we A. Order the same thing because it was so good or B. Try something new

Amazing. Keep up the delicious work!< /text>

Fresh, creamy & delicious guacamole at @guelaguetzarestaurant I have to say; one of THE best guacs I’ve ever had, and I’ve had a lot of guacs! The menu did not have any vegan entrees BUT the wait staff was so friendly & knowledgable that they went out of their way to assist me in veganizing a dish. They were so accommodating & understanding, they really made me feel welcome. As fellow vegans know; not all restaurants are good at making us feel like we are not a burden. Although the menu is not vegan friendly, I give them 5 ⭐️ for being so accommodating & respectful. 💚💚💚 #guelaguetza #guelaguetza2019 #guacamole #guac #avocado #vegantravels #veganlife #respectvegan</text>

Food was excellent. First cup of hot chocolate was cold asked the waiter for a replacement and from that point on he had an attitude. My bill was 80.00 dollars and I ended tipping him well
May be he should change his attitude we all work for a living.<//Text>

The food was delicious. I had mole coloradito and I can say it did not disappoint me. The horchata was great. I recommend it. The prices are a little high compared to other Mexican restaurants but it is worth it.< /Text>

Not bad.  I would give it 3.5 stars.  I wasn't crazy about the ambiance and the food was good but not great.  Our waitress was nice and allowed me to taste each wine before pairing it with my dish.< /review>

Excellent food. The rumors are true and their moles are fantastic, we did the mole sampler of their best sellers, and we paired it with the carnes sampler. For three people, those two were more than enough we had so many leftovers.

My only thing was that the live music was way too loud. Even when screaming we couldn't hear each other which dampen our experience since it was a goodbye dinner for a good friend. I feel like considering the space they could have gone without the amps/speakers and the volume would have been perfect.<//review>

Great Mexican food in a vibrant setting. Our party of six ordered family style and no one was disappointed. As noted on previous posts the mole was amazing. We sampled the flight, yum. Make reservations and parking is not fun, but the food is well worth the trek.<//Review>

We sat where we can see them cook the meat and everything smelled and looked so good. We ordered 2 of the family style platters and everything was so delicious. Loved the salsa and guacamole. They also had live music going on, which we all enjoyed. Our waiter was very friendly and helpful with what we we're ordering for the size party we had.. Only thing is they need more lighting in some areas. It was hard reading the menu.<//review>< pics>

4 stars is generous. Food was great. Everything else was questionable. I'm very low maintenance, yet there was multiple complications in the placing of and managing of my order. Lady next to me had the same issues.

I don't believe this was isolated. They need to work on how the resturants functions on the floor.< /Text>

So many different types of molé. Big restaurant..Valet parking in the back otherwise parking is bad. Lively music. Shopping section to bring molé home or clothing items. Alcoholic drinks were just okay. Many people celebrating. Huge restaurant.  Very helpful staff. The molé tamales was my absolute favorite<//text>

<Text>Yes I will say be very careful folks .... if you decide to patronize this place, check carefully your check before pay. They tried to stole $209.00 I realized it ...and they apologized but the charge is still in my account. They haven’t release the charge in my account. I had spoken with Alejandro...he said is the general manager. He doesn’t even know how to “release a hold” or “cancel a transaction” really?!?!
Hopefully the owners realize how much damage the employees are doing to this iconic place in LA

I was a big fan of this place, unfortunately today is the last time that I come here. I had a nice dinner, when I asked for my check it was for $65.00.
Then they brought my receipt to sign and it was $209.00
I checked my bank account and it was a charged for $209.00 and for $65.00. They couldn't figure out what happened.
The "manager" Alexia couldn't do nothing she said that I need to wait until the system clear out my account. ...Really!!! $209.00 !!!
They are stolen $209.00 and I have to deal with my bank to clear this. What kind of shady business is this.< /Text>< pics>

A great place get some Mexican food. You can't go wrong with anything there. They have surf they have turf. They have all in Between. They even have a Mexican piza made from corn tortillas.  A live band and a lot of fun little details.  Parking is valet but you can find some free parking around the neighborhood if you don't mind walking.<//review>

The ambiance is beautiful from the moment you pull up on the corner. You can't miss the mural with the little girl holding the corn while the boy tries grabbing a hen. Stepping inside the smell is great, the decor is traditional, and the live music with the xylophone pulls everything together.</review>

Excellent food.  Service was slow but curtious.  Went there for lunch on a Wednesday and enjoyed the yellow mole with chicken.  Took home half for the next day, so quantity large.  Price a little pricey but this food tastes home made.  Very good overall experience.< /review>

<rate>5</rate><review>Food is definitely not your every day type so coming here was a treat and definitely a great experience. At first for some reason the food reminded me a bit of Guatemalan dishes, and it should since it's from Oaxaca (South of Mexico), but they do have their own distinctive awesome taste. Prices are good; very busy and seating is a bit crowded however, it didn't affect the timing or quality of the food or their service. Parking is like $10 or something so be ready- live music was excellent- overall service and cleanings of the place was on point. Food portions are a good size so have an appetite when you come here. You will not be disappointed.< /review>< pictures>

It was 'aight. Good food and good atmosphere. This place is great for a family outing or a friendly get-together. It just isn't as hyped up as it is made out to be.<//text>

<Text>Holy Flan this is like a restaurant that you'd see in a 90's family movie about the terrors of divorce. Live music. Full tables. Wide plates. A deep platter of refillable tortilla chips with an enticing swirl of sauces splattered on top.
The barbacoa is not my favorite but I really enjoyed the guacamole and also something else I can't remember but I wish I did it would be helpful at a time like this<//Text>< pics>

<text>As someone of the fair-skinned persuasion, I still have a lot to learn about mole, but this place blew anything I've had before out of the water. I can never make up my mind when ordering because they're all so damned good! One of my favorite and probably most unique spots in the city.< /text>< time>

The best in southern Mexican food.  Everything is DELICIOUS.  Moles are the best. I don't really care for nopales but the corn nopales tortillas are good.  So glad it is down the street from me.</text>

There's really nothing to be amazed about. The food was cold, the meants were tough, the tortillas where doughy and very large. By the time you're half way through your dinner the tortilla is tough and cold. They specialise in mole but to say the truth I have had BETTER moles then La Guelaguetza. The mole was way way too sweet it was more like a sugar dinner rather than savory.</Text>

Amazing place to have dinner with the whole family to having a dinner date .  They do have live marimba which was great if you are sitting in the front of the restaurant. However if you are sitting in the back like we did we had no music and we couldn’t hear the band playing. I hope they consider putting some type of speakers that way the whole place can experience the music . The food & drinks are great, reasonable prices . Our waiters were amazing always making sure if we were okay, they have valet parking for $5 .< /Text>

First time coming to this place and it was a horrible experience. We ordered our food and once we got our food we got the quesadillas cold and a soup cold. Hot coffee came out to be cold coffee. To top it off for the night they kept bring items to our table that weren’t ordered. Once receiving the bill noticed that it was $237 !!! They insisted for me to pay them on items I never ordered or ate. Never again ! F*** this place</Review>

Good portions. Service was ok. Had to argue with one of the waiters on the type of beer and size I had ordered, maybe he was just busy...or had a bad day...or could'nt hear me...as it's a  pretty loud space (live band was playing). Restrooms were clean. Parking Is valet or good luck on the street.</Review>

NOTHING COMPARES TO DIN TAI FUNG. I will drive and wait hours and be #116 in line to eat here. When people ask me what to order at Din Tai Fung, I tell them, order EVERY single dumpling (not literally, but it's a challenge). I haven't had a bad dumpling, but in total honesty, I have had mediocre dishes here. Excluding the dishes outside of the dumpling realm, the dumplings are literally TO. DIE. FOR.</Review>

I love that we get to have an authentic restaurant that serves fresh food in our neighborhood. The restaurant in itself is a beautiful artwork. The attention to detail is even shown by the presentation of our food and how carefully its laid out. I had carnitas and my boyfriend had tacos. Everything was delicious, even the chips with bean spread. The lady that served us talked about the restaurants new opening and how it came to be. She sounded passionate to for the type of restaurant they opened and she made sure to make us feel welcomed.< /text>< pictures>

Just like the first time, the food was amazing. It's well seasoned, flavorful, and quick. I order Barbacoa de Chivo and they called Meat special plate. It took about 17 minutes to make. I make sure my friend will go there too so that they can taste their Menu.<//Text>

<time>1581742283934< /time><rating>1< /rating><Review>The place is nice and clean. People who work there are nice and all, but the food I tried for some reason didn't taste good as expected and wasn't even able to eat it. I told the waiter that I had a problem with the taste of it and he said thatsthow it was supposed to taste like, which I honestly believe it didn't and I explained that i wasn't even able to eat it and they just said "thatst how it's supposed to be" and I barely tasted it and I still had to pay for the dish, I just paid for the thing and left the whole plate. I wasn't happy they didn't even tried to solve my issue. So, I'm not going back to that place and I'm not recommending it to anybody. I came out really disappointed since somebody told me it was a good place. By the way the price was also ridiculous. It was an enchiladas plate $16 + $4 for thechorizo and +$4 for the cheese...yes, enchiladas with no cheese, 4 folded tortillas with extra mega super annoyingly SWEET mole, and I mean super sickly sweet sugary mole... So as far as I know mole isn't supposed to taste like that. Yes it's supposed to have a HINT of sweet but not to the point where you almost get diabetes by trying a couple spoonfuls.
Long story short I left the whole plate since they didn't even bother to rearrange my order and it really ruined my day driving all the way there just to waste my time, and money. For a $24 enchilada plate (4 folded tortillas soaked in sugary mole) what waste of time.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None< /response>< GmapID>

4 stars for the mescal selection.  A roomy place but not exactly cozy.  The food is for a very specific palate.< /review>

<Text>Celebrating my husband's birthday and it was our first time here. Ambience is great! Salsa music playing in the background. Mole was out of this world. Only tried the "coloradito". Has more of a sweet taste rather than spicy but still delicious.  Must come back to try some more things. Prices are on the high side but food was excellent!!! Check it out for youself.<//Text>< Rating>

Love, Love, Love coming to Guelaguetza after work on Friday’s for happy hour. The food is super delicious, drinks are good and great service. We especially like the chips and mole, the Mole Coloradito and the meat specialty Plate. Definitely recommend this place for authentic Mexican food!!!!!</text>

<Text>Super spacious and colorful restaurant that’s empty during early lunchtime, so you can take your time and enjoy your meal. The chapulines (sautéed grasshoppers) were SO GOOD. Please do yourself a favor and don’t let any fear of creepy crawlies get to you — the taste is almost like BBQ shrimp, except you can eat the shell and the taste is somewhat meatier. Also the mole rojo was some of the best mole I’ve ever had in my life!</Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipONij-_XAZSIQEJhJ3EozsqhwmQopXExx1wNR0R=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures><Response>None</Response><GmapID>0x80c2b87f94d62329:0xe605cc1bb679a2ac< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Out.Of.This.World.
If you ever find your self on Olympic, and are craving some authentic Oaxacan food. Look no further, the Mole here is the absolute greatest thing that shall ever grace your lips. The balance of sweet, savory and mild spice is perfection personified. The drinks, strong but not overwhelming. The staff, the friendliest folk you will ever meet. From traditional dishes to some new inventions, you will absolutely fall in love with something on the menu if not everything.  Highly recommend this place and I will be coming back with friends and family!
Oh and word of advice, make a reservation ahead of time!</text>

Tried the mole sampler. I didn't find any of the moles to be as complex and spicy as I have had other places. Stay away from the expensive drinks.  Sweet and no mezcal is in them. A lot of ice and a really big glass...nothing is in the drink!! At 14.50 each not what i was expecting.</text>

<review>Busy restaurant with a great atmosphere and delicious food!  Server was really nice and friendly.  Hostess needs some training; seems like she was not wanting to work.  Should greet all the guest as they walk in and thank them on the way out.  I saw how she interacted with the guest as they arrived and departed while we were waiting to be seated; unfriendly and not welcoming.  If I had not been here before I probably wouldn't return because of the hostess.</review><Rate>4< /Rate><user_id>118205493951349127980</user_id>< response>

Just like the first time, the food was amazing. It's well seasoned, flavorful, and quick. I order Barbacoa de Chivo and they called Meat special plate. It took about 17 minutes to make. I make sure my friend will go there too so that they can taste their Menu.< /text>

<rate>1</rate><Text>The place is nice and clean. People who work there are nice and all, but the food I tried for some reason didn't taste good as expected and wasn't even able to eat it. I told the waiter that I had a problem with the taste of it and he said thatsthow it was supposed to taste like, which I honestly believe it didn't and I explained that i wasn't even able to eat it and they just said "thatst how it's supposed to be" and I barely tasted it and I still had to pay for the dish, I just paid for the thing and left the whole plate. I wasn't happy they didn't even tried to solve my issue. So, I'm not going back to that place and I'm not recommending it to anybody. I came out really disappointed since somebody told me it was a good place. By the way the price was also ridiculous. It was an enchiladas plate $16 + $4 for thechorizo and +$4 for the cheese...yes, enchiladas with no cheese, 4 folded tortillas with extra mega super annoyingly SWEET mole, and I mean super sickly sweet sugary mole... So as far as I know mole isn't supposed to taste like that. Yes it's supposed to have a HINT of sweet but not to the point where you almost get diabetes by trying a couple spoonfuls.
Long story short I left the whole plate since they didn't even bother to rearrange my order and it really ruined my day driving all the way there just to waste my time, and money. For a $24 enchilada plate (4 folded tortillas soaked in sugary mole) what waste of time.</Text>< Pictures>

Very great service, and helpful staff. The staff went out of their way to take care of our table-- 5 star hospitality! But a cautious word to customers: the menu is a bit exotic, and can be different than expected, so keep an open mind. 😅<//review>

So want to give my honest impression. I had heard about this place and was excited to try from what I heard 'really great mole'. So after event at staples center we went. My 2 biggest take aways are #1 the food is good. Not amazing but no real complaints, just basic good food. The problem is for the price of the food, I will not be back. This was an honest $10-14 a plate mexican food. But at $20 a plate, $14 for a drink. Not worth it at all. For  two of us it came to $75. I left saying I've had comparable food for $35. No where near the 'best mexican or Oaxacan food I've had. Seems like its overpriced which shadows the food. If the plates were reasonably priced even $15 a plate it would be somewhere I might come back to. But honestly if you know Mexican/Oaxacan food I've had better without the hype. For being a southern California native you gotta come better than this. We know our cultural food and when your charging $16 for a tortilla with no 'filling' calling it an enchilada but to actually add chicken or whatever to it to make it an actual enchilada and not a wet tortilla your asking an extra $4, sorry wont be back.< /text>

Drove 2 hours to come eat here and the valet was very rude when telling us there was no parking, when in fact they had space for more cars. Don’t waste your time here, there are other authentic Oaxaca’s restaurants close by.< /Review>

The cocktails are fantastic. The tacos of barbacoa goat meat were excellent..
The service was good but a little too laid-back... but eventually you get what you need. Very authentic oaxacan cuisine.</text>

Great place for unique Oaxacan food in Los Angeles. All the different types of mole you never knew you wanted to try. I like the service, food, and atmosphere. On weekends head early because this place gets packed. Use yelp to get a reservation before going if possible.< /Review>

Anyone giving guelgetza less than five stars is out of their friggin mind. This place is a 10/10 in every way. Great authentic relaxed vibes but very lively. Beautiful decor. The most unique Oaxacan menu I've ever seen. There are literally no places like this in any other city besides LA. The food is absolutely delicious, with all kinds of Moles that you can't get anywhere else. Amazing homemade tortillas. There are 3-4 places I always recommend to travelers visiting LA and this is usually #1. There's just nowhere like it or even close.<//text>

I came to this spot to have a tasty, boozy breakfast and to watch a soccer match.

Here's the result: Liverpool won (top of the league) and the Micheladas were not too bad either.< /review>

<Rate>3</Rate><text>Went on a Saturday morning. Wasn't open at 9 as stated- opened around d 9:15am. Service was slow- had to continually ask for coffee and other drink refills. Ordered menudo- was average but side condiments were lacking- only given chopped onion and lime- no oregano, cilantro etc. portion was generous and prices reasonable. Restaurant is quaint and clean. It's downstairs but there's a little elevator for handicap accessibility. Husband had huevos rancheros and said it was ok. Accepts cards. Paid parking nearby.<//text>< Time>

<Text>Wonder flavors. Authentic.  No Tex-Mex here! This is the real deal. Rich flavors  of Mexico from the Oaxacan region. Nostalgia reigns supreme here with live music that has a Latin beat and atmosphere that conjures a little Mexican joint from back home.</Text>< response>

<Text>The mole is as good as they say! Overall the place is big with live music nightly so the noise is incredible which makes any conversation challenging. If you can get there before the music, it is better. And there is a back room where you don't get the full volume of music.</Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

Nice weather. I'd love to take them on a camping trip. Excellent interior design. Most of the evening I loved live music. The list is very broad. The Flying Mole is a sweet touch. OMG, we waited half an hour. Well, they have snacks and bread, you can wait some time in the list. But the food is totally worth the wait. Yes, right, I'll wait too long. The service is very good. Nice group to touch... If we sit in front of the roof, the method of rotation will make you destroy one ear.</review>

The food was edible, the service was sub par, but at least it's nice inside. This place was recommended to us, so I had high hopes. However my family and I were dissatisfied and disappointed. We would never come here again. If you like Oaxacan food then this place is good for you.</Text>

We drove all the way to LA to try this restaurant for their mole. It was horrible. First of all you can only park valet, second the service was horrible, third I make better mole than that. The rice was disgusting as well.  And to top it off it was expensive. What a waste of my time and money.<//review>

<review>Best Oaxacan restaurant I've been to in LA. The horchata is to die for and the service and food is out of this world. Totally recommend this for any occasion and the huevos rancheros are a must!!< /review>< Rating>

<userid>114316337927375193915</userid><review>I loved the experience. I didn't pick their tastiest meal, but the authenticity of the place was good to me. I should have been boring and ordered some carne asada but I tried to be different and order stewed-like pork smothered in tomato sauce.

The beer was good. It was some cucumber-flavored beer that was surprisingly super fresh tasting.

The Bloody Maria was not my favorite. There was some sweetener added to it that I was not able to ID. Should've ordered the regular one, but I was adventuring.

Didn't take away from the experience of the open concept of the restaurant, live band, awesome atmosphere. Good stuff!< /review><Name>Shawn Alestock<//Name></record></dataset><record>

Fantastic! Mole heaven. So many positive reviews already and looking through a few dozen I’d have to agree with all the raves. One of the very best parts: the friendly, welcoming service. We really felt the hosts wanted us to understand and enjoy. ¡Muchas Gracias!</Text>

Wonderful atmosphere. I like to bring people here when they are visiting from out of town. Great interior design. Nice live music most nights I've been. Menu is very extensive. The flight of moles is a cute touch.</review>

<text>This place is expensive for the food they offer. I thought I would get authentic Oaxacan  food but ended up disappointed. The so called memelas was basically the same thing as their homemade tortillas but topped with beans and cheese. The  tlayuda choriqueso was a let down. It was literally a big tortilla with a crazy amount of cheese that was so overwhelming you couldn't even enjoy it and a sad amount of meat. For $16 I feel really ripped off. The only saving factor was our very nice waiter.</text>< username>

Now for the Hotpot. If it's your first time, I HIGHLY suggest you let the staff cook the hotpot for you. We had Joshua cook 2 types for us. Guelaguetza Restaurante!< /Text>

The food is amazingly delicious specially their mole rojo the one they serve with their chips. I ordered the horchata it was good. The tlayuda was good as well but the mole is the shining plate hands down. The price range around $11 and up If I recall correctly. Lovely ambiance with live music on certain days call to make sure. They also have a bar. The only thing is parking can be hard to find if you don't want to pay their valet parking.< /Review>< response>

Decided to celebrate my birthday here since I am a mole fanatic but I was very disappointed with the service. I made reservations for 20 people but last minute had just 3 addtl guest but The manager Alexia was not understanding and didnt want to accommodate my guest Even though their was empty tables and chairs around us she didnt allow us to use them. As a manger I felt that she should had made the effort to move some chairs and tables around knowing that with such a large party the bill would be almost $1000. Due to this experience I will never be returning or recommending it any of my friends or family< /text>

I've been wanting to visit this restaurant for a few years and finally made it there this past weekend. The wait time for our party of 13 on a Saturday evening was about 30-40 minutes. Not bad. Parking wasn't too much of an issue, for me at least, because I found parking around the neighborhood streets.
The wait staff was friendly, the food didn't take too long to come out, and the drinks were good. I had some margaritas. I ordered the black molé. I wasn't really too impressed with the plating as it seemed my chicken thigh was drowning in sauce with a small scoop of rice beside it. We each have our own preferences though.
I wasn't too fond of the molé but that's okay. It just wasn't a taste that I'm used too.  However I definitely want to try out their other flavors so I'd probably go back again.
It's a nice restaurant, definitely lots of things to try out on their menu. MY overall experience was good.< /text>

<Text>I normally post positive ratings but this time i can't. The sevice was slow and bad. They took almost an hour to take our order and finally when our food arrived the food wasn't that good at all and to make matters worse the glass on my drink was sticky yuck! Their dishes are pretty pricy too. This was my first time coming in to this restaurant and I'm pretty disappointed. I will definately not come back.< /Text><pics>None</pics><Response>None</Response>< gmap_id>

The food was excellent! We started with Queso Fundido which had spicy chorizo sauteed with mushrooms and a mix of cheeses. I also got the Queso Quesadillas which were delicious with their hand made tortillas. My fiance got Camarones al Mojo de Ajo which she liked very much, and I got Mole Estofado with chicken. The mole was delicious (slightly sweet and spicy as in spices) and the chicken meat would just fall off the bone! I do recommend the Chocolate de Leche (hot chocolate made with real milk along with the natita which is the delicious film that get created when boiling milk) and they pair that with a bread you can use to dip in the hot chocolate. Lastly, their flan was delectable which had notes of caramel, chocolate and coffee. Highly recommend this place and I totally get why Evan Kleinman from Good Food and the LA Times always praise this place. Also, owner/daughter has a new cook book that came out! Totally want to buy it!< /text>

<review>We visited the restaurant last evening 12/27/2019 and were a party of 7 .. waited almost half an hour to get a table as the reviews were so fantastic..and what a huge disappointment!
Nothing we ordered was even closely palatable. The waiter at our table would go missing for 10/15 minutes and couldn’t even recommend the right dishes.
When we ordered empanadas they turned out to be quesadillas .. which is ok if only the waiter had clarified that.
Enchiladas, chalupas all suffered similar fates. Lacking visual appeal and taste
Supposedly ‘spicy’ dishes were bland, the chicken over cooked and hard, the moles underwhelming.
The tres leches cake was dry!!
We wasted a lot of food.. and for the first time we didn’t take the leftovers.
I would give them 0 stars.. the 1 star is for their ambience..the decor is lovely but very deceptive.
It promises one of great food.. which remains unfulfilled.
Unless something changes with the food/chef or their ability to handle crowds effectively..
We are never going back!! #moneybackplease</review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

My favorite dish is the Tacos de Barbacoa de Chivo. Their tortilla chips with mole are always a perfect start. Drinks are nice, the Frambuesita is my fave.<//Review>

Live music, delicious mole, and delicious beer. You could not ask for a better experience than what Guelaguetza offers. This place usually gets crowded and you need to make a reservation well in advance or else you will have a hard time getting a table. We reserved a table a week in advance to be safe. Be prepared to pay for valet or look for parking on the street. This place is a gem.</review>

This place is all about the mole. The table of chips are even topped off with mole. I love Mexican food and this place came highly recommended by Mexican friends. It's definitely a seemingly more authentic Mexican experience than most with a not so generic menu (don't come here for a taco/burrito/quesadilla experience). One of the specialties is a grasshopper dish, so I think that's enough said! The moles are rich and flavorful. The food didn't feel real heavy as Mexican food often can be. It's not loaded with heavy cheese, cream, or grease. The sauces all definitely taste like their made fresh from scratch. They have live music often which was pretty cool. It's pretty popular and can get crowded but it's a big place the wait isn't too long. Prices are pretty typical and it's a large plate of food.</Text>

Had a reservation for 8 people and it wasn’t honored although I showed confirmation on email and text. Rude and kept us waiting for an hour. Have been many times, recommended to others. Never again! Terrible customer service.< /Text>

Holy mole 😉 The mole is excellent. I've tried just about everything on the menu and it's all excellent! The atmosphere is a large open space, great for large groups and they sell jars of their mole at the checkout counter.<//review>

Decided to celebrate my birthday here since I am a mole fanatic but I was very disappointed with the service. I made reservations for 20 people but last minute had just 3 addtl guest but The manager Alexia was not understanding and didnt want to accommodate my guest Even though their was empty tables and chairs around us she didnt allow us to use them. As a manger I felt that she should had made the effort to move some chairs and tables around knowing that with such a large party the bill would be almost $1000. Due to this experience I will never be returning or recommending it any of my friends or family<//Text>

<review>I normally post positive ratings but this time i can't. The sevice was slow and bad. They took almost an hour to take our order and finally when our food arrived the food wasn't that good at all and to make matters worse the glass on my drink was sticky yuck! Their dishes are pretty pricy too. This was my first time coming in to this restaurant and I'm pretty disappointed. I will definately not come back.</review><name>Maria Rosales<//name>< resp>

I'm never disappointed with this restaurant. Great food. We always come here for breakfast, it can get pretty busy but the service is always good. It's totally worth the wait. They take the time to refill your cup of coffee which by the way it's amazing! This deli has been our favorite for years.</Review>

<date>1472425998188< /date><review>This place is all about the mole. The table of chips are even topped off with mole. I love Mexican food and this place came highly recommended by Mexican friends. It's definitely a seemingly more authentic Mexican experience than most with a not so generic menu (don't come here for a taco/burrito/quesadilla experience). One of the specialties is a grasshopper dish, so I think that's enough said! The moles are rich and flavorful. The food didn't feel real heavy as Mexican food often can be. It's not loaded with heavy cheese, cream, or grease. The sauces all definitely taste like their made fresh from scratch. They have live music often which was pretty cool. It's pretty popular and can get crowded but it's a big place the wait isn't too long. Prices are pretty typical and it's a large plate of food.< /review>< gmap_id>

First time here and definitely was pleased. The servers are absolutely friendly and very helpful. I had the chicken mole red sauce and it comes in pieces,I love eating it shredded with breast meat and they offered to prepare for me the way I like it. We even asked jokingly to try the grasshoppers and they brought it for us to try. Different but not bad at all. Definitely would come back again especially for the great service.</text>

Visit the restaurant for the first time tonight. It wasn't very busy. The waiter was inattentive and the food took 40 min to arrive. We ordered 4 meals, 2 drinks and 2 sodas and two mezcal shots. They served the drinks first after about 20 min of ordering. They poured us two shot, but the second shot was only half because they ran out. Nothing was offered in return. When we received our bill it was $160 and were charged 15 bucks per shot. Food wasn't as expected. Dry meat and tortillas, food was cold.I cannot and will not promote this restaurant and will not return. They try to cash in on the so called famous name,  but have tasted and enjoyed a good and better meal else where in the city.</review>

<Time>1527525471673</Time><text>You cannot make reservations on weekends you will have to make them two weeks prior coming to eat at the restaurant. When you get there and you give them your name and how many are in your party it's a long wait we waited for about an hour and a half. We did see that they have preference for white people they give them the first choice they kept on telling us oh you have four or five or six people ahead of you but once they saw Caucasian people coming and waiting they will give them  the preference to be seated. They do not have organization in the way that they put the people on the waiting list. The parking space is too small and supposedly they park your car they charge you to park it. Our server did not do a good job like I said again it came down to serving white people first then us Latin people. She came to the  table next to us asking them if they needed water or soda or anything else so many  times and she never came once to our table and asked if we needed anything. Our food was not hot enough and whatever we had it was overcooked honestly I am not happy. We didn't even  get our check I had to go and ask her to give it to me he waited and waited. To me is not fair because everyone is paying for their food and for the service. Why do they give preference two other people. The manager or the owner needs to look into this like I said we are all are paying for our services< /text>< GmapID>

Great place the food is delicious the live music is awesome and the service is amazing. My wife and I have been there many times and the attention we get from the servers is very professional. The wait is worth it because of their mouth watering menu. I recommend it...</Review>

This place was hyped up to me supposed to be the best in L.A. Not in my opinion. On the night my family and I went they set up a live band (not acoustic) like they where in they where in the staples center. So loud echoing off of all of the hard surfaces, we asked to be seated away from the stage and we could not hear each other talk, at the end if the night my ears where ringing.  There wasn't a lot of tasty items to choose from in my opinion everything we got was underwhelming unless you're a huge fan of mole. People in my party were and ate 2 bites of their dinner. My daughter ordered empanadas and got a flower tortilla folded over some chicken and cheese (like an uncooked quesadilla). Not inexpensive either.<//text>

OMG we waited an hour and a half. Good thing they had snacks and bread you can order while you wait. But the food was totally worth the wait. Yes, it was so good that I would wait that long again. The service was good. The band was a nice touch... Except we were seated right in front and the way the tables are turned makes it such that you are being blasted in one ear. That was so uncomfortable. Or party of 4 could hardly hear each other. But the food is great!< /review>

Location offers free and Valet parking

Though the wait was 1.5 hrs, it was definitely worth it!

Food: very traditional from the Oaxaca area

Price: portions merit the price

Live music: (Saturday night) marimba/xylophone something different and beautiful

Cocktail drinks: Guerra Tigre was amazing, spicy and sweet!

Great ambiance for large/small groups< /text>

First time here, sat by the stage where they had a live band (super loud, but super good ----- My friend joked that sitting by the live band, this place is perfect to take someone when you're terrible at dinner conversation ).

Was a part of a big group so we ordered some kind of giant sampler grill thing that came with guac, sauces, tortillas, and more variety of meats than we could finish ! They have plenty of tables for large groups (ours was 11 people) and can accommodate smaller groups I'm sure. Servers were all super nice and polite.

Parking lot in the back & we had to valet, but I'd personally rather do that than park around LA</review>

Authentic people from Oaxaca. They speak the language. Love my culture I’m as Mexican an they come.  OVERRATED place isn’t what they say. Not to mention it’s locate on a ghetto neighborhood. And I’m sorry to say this food isn’t that great/decent. They have a tendency to feel lesser beings. Thus causing them to act defensive as if you are going to make them feel discriminated against. You’re better off eating at a lonchera(AKA Lunch truck)< /Text>

<text>Today October 7th, 2018 we went to this Restaurant for the first time and the last. If you want to waste your money and get the Montezuma Revenge go to this Restaurant in the Ghetto of East LA .   Expensive, dirty, and the food is not not authentic Mexican. We asked for coffee and it tasted as if it was from the day before. Mole and enchiladas tasted like ketchup and Sugar. They just dump big Tortillas, and beans with lots of old vegetables, You can see that their Waitress bring you the wrong food and charge you a lot. Anyway  their customers are just one time customer. I rather go to a supermarket and buy a can of beans and good bread and make a sandwich. They charged me almost a hundred dollars for three people and 90% of the food was left on the table. Their restaurant's floor is dirty with Guacamole and pieces of tortillas and other trash. I will make sure that I tell my friend not to go.

I love the authenticity the staff and characteristics that yhis restaurant offers starting from the gift shop at entrance, menu selection and the indoor decoration. The staff is very friendly and the times I have sat down to eat, the band plays known songs that you can sing along to. Super cute stage not so loud perfect to still enjoy a conversation. A must visit.< /review>

Overall not bad, but I wouldn't make it a weekly visit.  When they charge $5.00 for a glass of Horchata, that should include a refill.  Make reservations a week ahead, or stand waiting an hour+ for a table.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

Generous portions but I’m afraid the food was stale and cold. Frankly my lemonade was hotter than my plate of fries. Great taste, modest portions but I was unimpressed with the quality of food. At least the place is photogenic for those who are more interested in the aesthetic than the quality of food.</Review>

This place was hyped up to me supposed to be the best in L.A. Not in my opinion. On the night my family and I went they set up a live band (not acoustic) like they where in they where in the staples center. So loud echoing off of all of the hard surfaces, we asked to be seated away from the stage and we could not hear each other talk, at the end if the night my ears where ringing.  There wasn't a lot of tasty items to choose from in my opinion everything we got was underwhelming unless you're a huge fan of mole. People in my party were and ate 2 bites of their dinner. My daughter ordered empanadas and got a flower tortilla folded over some chicken and cheese (like an uncooked quesadilla). Not inexpensive either.</review>

This place was good. I dont think it's the BEST thing ever but it's definitely worth a try. Apparently they have live music and entertainment often so that's cool, I went around 2pm and it wasnt busy. Service was great and food was good. I have enchiladas and tried their mole and their guacamole and it was all good. Check it out.</review>

I was in heaven with the chilaquiles and corn tortillas and the salsas. 😝 They reminded me of my mom’s and I haven’t had them in about 20 years. The atmosphere was fun, we got sooo much food with our orders and the service was great. They were quick and attentive but not overbearing. We picked this place because of the reviews and chapulines since we were feeling adventurous and it didn’t disappoint! I’m just glad we fought thru the traffic get there. (That was the only downside but it was worth the wait).</review>

Yesterday was my birthday and decided this place was appropriate. I'm giving this place a two star rating because they sat a party of five in a table of four next to us. Now that's not the problem... problem was the back of the fifth chair the added was facing our table and the person had long hair. So her hair was pretty much on our table. We ask the hostess if she could move us to another table and she was very rude and refused to accommodate us. We told our waiter about this problem and he said he couldn't do anything for us. Its like they didn't see how unsanitary and disgusting that was. My daughter lost her appetite and refused to eat. They really need to work on their sitting arrangements and customer service.</text>

This place was so good! Best Chile rellenos I’ve ever had, the roja sauce is delicious. Oaxaca cheese is amazing. All the food was great though and portions are generous. Only downsides: Music is fun but really loud, drinks are pricey (food is not) and expect a wait.< /Text>

<text>Traveled a distance to get here and it doesn't disappoint. Beautiful atmosphere, friendly service and great food. Tamale was large and was very moist. Also, the enchiladas are a must for enthusiasts. And let's not forget the live entertainment!<//text>< pics>

Super friendly staff, amazing horchata, and some really cool vibes. When I told our server I was vegan, she recommended the cactus salad, which I thoroughly enjoyed with a bit of salsa and tortilla chips.</review>

Oaxacan culinary fiest. This place is legendary and it did not disappoint. Call me crazy but I was hooked with the grasshopper tacos. The moles are authentic as they come. Since they ship all of their ingredients from Oaxaca you can’t go wrong. The regional musicians were cool and not super loud like mariachis can be. The tortillas are freshly made by hand and that was the start of it all for me. The portions are far bigger than expected. So if you like left overs. You’re in for a surprise.  The mezcal margaritas were delicious.  The bar is a very nice section of the restaurant to hang in. The parking is really bad even though they have valet and they’re trying to be helpful. But very limited street parking. The lobby is teeny tiny and since they are slammed for dinner no one really fits in the waiting area inside or out. So this is why I docked them a star. The food does get a 5 star over all. But since I am rating ALL of the experience it has to get a 4 or 4 1/2 if I could to be fare. Provecho (enjoy)< /Text>

Eat at the bar if you can, great fast service. I had the mole to share for two. Excellent mezcal selection-- I love the Wahaka Mezcalero brand and sold it heavily when I worked as a server at a Mezcal and Tequila bar.</review>

<text>Great place to have lunch or dinner and to bring your date. This restaurant has authentic Mexican food from Oaxaca. If you're a good adventurist, you may be compelled to try the fried crickets. Also, don't forget to order your side of Oaxaca cheese, it is just amazing. I believe this place also holds performances since I saw a small stage inside. You can also enjoy a michelada at their dedicated michelada bar. One thing to note is that you can park on the street or use their valet parking service.</text><Rate>5< /Rate><name>Florentino Bernal<//name>< Date>

Gualaguetza is know for having excellent mole, but please be warned for those with but allergies, their mole is made with peanuts and almonds. I unfortunately could not indulge in this Oaxacan specialty, but enjoyed everything else from the cocktails to the string cheese to their grilled meats! The atmosphere is very festive and the service was excellent! Our server was so kind to pay closer attention to my nut allergy once informed him.</text>

< Review>
Great place. Nice "big party hall" kind of Mexican restaurant atmosphere. Really tasty food. Mole sauce is fantastic. And the Mezcal menu is probably the largest in LA. It's a super place for a couple or a huge party.

Make sure you use valet parking. It's only $3.50 and the spots around the area can have steep towing times. Better safe than sorry.<//Review>

My family and I saw this restaurant on featured on the travel channel.  The food looked amazing so we decided to try it out. It not only lived up to it's reputation but exceeded our expectations.   Our server David was not only attentive but eager to make suggestions.  Since it was our first time here we had lots of questions.  He was patient and made sure our dining experience was a positive one.  If you love mole this is definitely the place!!!< /text>

<text>I will just say this place is amazing, they are in the middle of Koreatown in Los Angeles the place is packed they have a live band playing and the waiters seats us to a nice table. The food - the mole as they call it is the best I've ever tasted in my life, the asada is delicious also the drinks are great they are heavily flavored with mescal. It's clean it's a nice environment I highly suggest you go there and see what this place is absolutely amazing Top Notch everything very happy!<//text><gmapID>0x80c2b87f94d62329:0xe605cc1bb679a2ac< /gmapID><Date>1533012863066<//Date>< user_name>

<Review>I have been wanting to try this place for quite a long time now. I finally got to come here with my friend last week. I met the owners at the last stop in Ludo Bites pop up tour across the nation in Manhattan Beach which I heard just a little bit about the 14 different types of mole sauces made here. I knew I would have to come here eventually to try it.

I like the dark mole especially when it's thick and chocolatey and not like the red sauce you normally see on Mexican dishes. This would be something I would come back to try a different mole sauce on a different dish. With live entertainment, we can spend the entire evening here drinking margaritas and eating chips and salsa after a good meal. What more can I saw with so many pictures and reviews. Come try it for yourself and tell me which is your favorite mole sauce.</Review>< Pics>

This place was amazing!!!! To start off they give you some chips with mole coloradito and queso fresco. I ordered a vegan tlayuda which was amazing. The people I was with ordered the guelaguetza tlayuda and mole rojo. They absolutely loved their food. The portions here are huge!! And they have live music every evening and mostly all day saturday and sunday. I would highly recommend this place to anybody.</Text>

Best place for mole! I received great service here too. It can get pretty busy, so plan ahead. I believe they take reservations for parties of 2 or more. If you've never had mole, Guelaguetza is an awesome first.<//text>

Went her for the first time last Saturday and we had a great time we ordered El festival de moles a dish that came with the four moles they offer in sample bowls with a side of rice all of them were very delicious but out of the four I gotta say that the yellow mole was my favorite we also had the Quesillo Fundido wich was melted Oxacan cheese topped with chorizo, delicious appetizer! Then to accompany our food we ordered the house margarita "La Guelaguetza" a mix of mezcal peppino! And to settle everything a couple of shot of Don Julio Añejo out of their very big selection of tequilas! Cant go wrong here, I will return many more times to much to try in one day! Also live music!!<//Review>

I'm craving memelas however, this time I decided to try a Tlayuda Guelaguetza  it's a huge tortilla smothered with prok rinds, black beans, Oaxacan cheese, cabbage, queso fresco, and 3 meats (cecina, chorizo, tasajo).The also have live music - I like the fact that it is not too loud and you can still have a conversation with music in the background.</Text>

So awesome! Live music and it's all about the mole!!!! Be sure to make a reservation, no matter what time you want to go. This is a very popular place. Valet parking outside for a couple of bucks.<//review>

The bad...
After waiting for 40 minutes to be seated we waited another 45 minutes to get out food, we asked for lemon 4/5 times and it took 10 minutes.
The good...
Every single of the 6 plates we got was excellent on taste presentation and price</Text>

It's worth a stop just for the chips topped with their sweet red mole. Try all types of moles and the Oaxacan string cheese! Depending on whether you like the live music or not, the place is big enough to get right up close to fun musicians, or make your way to the back where it's a little easier to talk.<//text>

<Text>The food was great there was a band playing as well, honestly it was all great but the only yhing was that my server had me waiting almost 30 minutes for my check. Honestly, I think if I would not have gotten up to ask about him I would have been there for a good amount of time. I will be back though. If that would not have happened I would have given 5 stars.</Text>< Pics>

<Text>I've been excited & wanting to go here since I saw them on Food Paradise and Andrew Zimmern's show, but I was a little disappointed with the experience. It was good, but nothing special. They were known for their moles so I tried the Festival de Moles and it was okay.  4 different moles, but they all tasted pretty much the same and were overly sweet. Nothing special or memorable.  I did try the chapulines and they were very good. I would definitely recommend getting them with an alcoholic beverage to offset the saltiness.< /Text>< Pics>

<text>Food is good
service is the worst even the valet personally stole from our car and i though i paid a fee so they could take care of my car i didn't pay for them to steal from my car... I will not go there again due to the fact i brought it to their attention and they did nothing they dont care for their customers...... and allow the employees to steal from customers....<//text>< pictures>

It might be because my upbringing around Mexican food at home, but I thought this place was okay. Very long wait and very loud inside, not a good restaurant for quiet conversation. It's good for those who have yet to try mole, but I didn't find it that special.</review>

Delicious Oaxacan food in a fun atmosphere in Koreatown area. It often feels a bit like a party, albeit w/ Latin music and excellent Oaxacan food. If you don't like loud noises, ask to not sit in front of the band. They sell their yummy mole in jars. It can get crowded especially weekend evenings so be prepared to wait at certain times.</Review>

<text>I'll be honest with you, I'm a nose to tail kinda guy. This place ticks all the right boxes for me and my wife. The restaurant had a great atmosphere, our server was great. Very knowledgeable and versed with the menu. She was able to make some great recommendations and we were not disappointed. I'd suggest the charcuterie board for starters. I've definitely been craving going back here just haven't had the chance. Don't forget to tip your servers!< /text><pics>None</pics><Response>None<//Response><gmap_id>0x80c2b87f94d62329:0xe605cc1bb679a2ac< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I don't think it's unreasonable to expect chicken-filled enchiladas when paying for a $20 plate of chicken enchiladas. Imagine my surprise when I get home to find tortillas and cheese and rice but no chicken. I don't mean that there was less chicken than I expected. There was no chicken at all.< /Text>

<text>I've been excited & wanting to go here since I saw them on Food Paradise and Andrew Zimmern's show, but I was a little disappointed with the experience. It was good, but nothing special. They were known for their moles so I tried the Festival de Moles and it was okay.  4 different moles, but they all tasted pretty much the same and were overly sweet. Nothing special or memorable.  I did try the chapulines and they were very good. I would definitely recommend getting them with an alcoholic beverage to offset the saltiness.<//text><rate>3<//rate><response>None< /response>< GmapID>

I tried chille relleno which is a stuffed poblano pepper, it comes with two, so I had one with cheese and the other with chicken. The chicken was more flavorful. For dessert, I tried the chocoflan and it was good. I will return and try the mole next time.</Text>

<review>This is authentic Mexican, this place has great service our waiter came twice to see if everything was ok, great atmosphere they had Mexican music playing in background. Bother me and my girlfriend ordered eggs with chorizo served with black beans and rice we opted to go with the extra large homemade tortilla which was extra but worth it. Portions are huge if bringing children recommend sharing your plate with them. Prices were also very reasonable. The only negative that I have is I ordered the regular flan/custard for desert and it was not creamy at all felt like I was eating jello. Would recommend to friends and family.<//review>< Pictures>

I enjoy the drinks and the live music it's a very nice place to go and unwind after a long day. Im not a big fan of the food as a oaxacan im a bit picky that might be it but drinks are amazing and great selection of mezcal< /text>

<time>1514474236348< /time><text>Thea wait for this place is crazy. Once at your table, the fact that there is live music playing at the restaurant makes it really hard for your waiter to hear what you want. I had to order my coke about 3 times before they finally brought it to me, then the wait for the food is also another 30 mins. We got seated around 8:30 and left the restaurant until like 11... The place has good Oaxacan food, but if you're looking for a romantic or quiet place, go elsewhere.< /text><Gmap_id>0x80c2b87f94d62329:0xe605cc1bb679a2ac</Gmap_id>< pics>

Service was great but I think food is definitely overpriced.
I went near morning time, the place was not very full at all, no waiting.

The drinks, are too strong in my opinion, so if that’s what you’re after then it works out great but for me, I look for a drink that is tasty rather than drinking just to be drunk. The flavor of the mezcal in the drinks is also very smoky and I did not like it at all, really ruined the mango drink.

My food came out cold but at that point I figured I complained enough and just ate it. Tastes good, but again, not worth the price.

Casa Oaxaca in Santa Ana in my opinion is better quality and at a better price.<//Review>

The margaritas are great (refreshing, flavorful  not to sweet) , the pina coladas are resplendent (creamy, boozy, silky, perfectly, lightly sweetened) and the fresh guacamole is SOOO good. Creamy, flavorful, fresh, and not too salty. Which is why I was slightly disappointed last night - we ordered the festival of moles, the black mole with pork, the mole Coloradito to with pork, enchiladas with red mole - so, a lot of mole. Across the board, they were all way, way too sweet - almost like a candy syrup. Like, loads sweeter than the pina coladas, to give a point of reference. I'm hoping it was an off night since the mole was spot on and flavorful when I visited 2 years ago. Chapulines are usually greasy and chewy in a bad way, not sure they ever figured out how to fry them properly. Live music is fun, great for group parties. I'll definitely try it again in case the mole (which it's known for) goes back to the way it was when I first tried it. Make sure you make reservations. The wait for a table, even on a Wednesday night, is about 1 hour for walk ins during prime dinner time.<//Review>< pics>

Me and my parents used to come here alot. And they are authentic natives from Oaxaca. And before the quality was legit from there homeland. But we recently we there and it just doesnt taste the same. The quality how downgraded significantly the quesillo or the trademark cheese from Oaxaca is very tacky and cheap tasting. They honestly are starting to cut corners and makes less quality food. Shame they are misrepresenting such culture with one of the best foods in Mexico.</Text>

<Review>Good food and the service was prompt. However, it's not your typical Mexican cuisine. Some of the things you expect from other restaurants are different here. For example, we ordered some cheese enchiladas and their take on that dish is an open-faced pile of cheese on a tortilla. It wasn't melted or anything. I don't know if that was a regional thing or a mistake. Also, it's in Koreatown so valet parking is worth it.</Review>< Pics>

<review>I decided to give them a try once again. I had been there years ago and was totally disappointed. I have a few friends that love this place and constantly attend so, I decided to join them and give them a try again. It has definitely been remodeled since my last visit. We ordered drinks and I must say their alcohol is on point. Unfortunately, it took forever to get noticed for the drinks to keep coming and the wait was pretty redict to say since we sat right in front of the bar.i ordered a memela but unfortunately it was overload with cheese, beans? They where in there somewhere supposably and the aciento was nowhere to be found. Honestly, don't know if I'd ever be back. Sad for such an iconic Oaxacan restaurant.< /review>< response>

<review>The food is always amazing here, we went to celebrate my mothers 61st birthday, we brought a cake from an outside bakery and the location allowed us to bring it so they could surprise her with it. They even dand ab provided a beautiful cake candle that played music. There is also great cocktails and alot of Mezcal to chose from, they have live band and great entertainment, I would definitely recomend trying this place with friends and family.< /review>< resp>

I'm sorry to give this place a 2 because of the loud music, we could not carry a conversation and it was hard to even place the order!!! If I like live music as an ambience, like the marimba or trio that they had before, if I ever go back I will make sure that they don't have a group playing!!! The food is great still!!!</text>

I was there  01/17/2019 6:50pm

I’m handicap person I was looking for handicap parking space and they have only one legally for entire restaurant and the entrance was block with barriers.  I ask to valet parking if they have more. The Valet parking  person told me “No”  You have to park in regular parking lot pay like every body els. Like I did. I ask the guys if he charge for park in handicap he said to me No. ok I not going to pay you, I have handicap plates he said to me your car is going to be tollway if you don’t  pay.
I walk to the front door  and I seen  the valet person run to handicap parking space to move  the car who was parking in handicap space(white Honda Civic) i notes they don’t have handicap plates.
he told me I can park there now when I ready walk to front door.
I speak to restaurants management about the problem she was nice to me but she say they don’t work for restaurant .  I going to speack to them so you dont  get charge for parking.
I have maney that’s reason to go eat out.
I understand  is different company but my point is I was discriminated for valet parking company who you guys hired.
I don’t want nothing for free.is very  nice family restaurant good food good live music
I stay we eat and “spend $61.27” for to two people did you thing by attending me nice is going to fix the problem “No”.
I can sue you for discrimination against handicap person by state of California.
And that is my legal right<//Review>

YUM. Good food, good drinks, good atmosphere. A little too loud but sometimes the real problem is parking, although there is valet available.

I take all of my out if town guests there.<//text>

Absolutely the best mole I have ever had. Definitely have to get the sample mole platter to try the different moles. The love music is an awesome touch.</Text>

Avoid this Mexican food place as much as you can. First of all this is not authentic Mexican food. The place is beautiful enough to fool you. As soon as you walk in it’s loud, me and my friends couldn’t talk to each other at all. I came here I was invited by a guy saying this was “amazing Mexican food” How embarrassing he doesn’t even know what authentic Mexican food is. I ordered a chorizo plate that cost almost 20 for a plate with chorizo and salad... my friend ordered chicken it was cold, it looked like it was frozen chicken or chicken that was a few days old. Her plate even came with fries and they were as terrible as they look.. how sad when even the fries are TERRIBLE!!!I also ordered a taquitos Incase I wouldn’t like the chorizo and the “crunchy” taquitos were soft. On top of that our bill was almost 300!!! That’s insane. The service was good but the food was the worst I have ever tried in my life and I’ve been here all my life. Do not come here or take your family here. Waste of money. I honestly don’t know where these “good reviews” are coming from. Gordon Ramsey needs to check up on this place!<//review>

Amazing food, cool bar, great music!  Service was on point and food for a large group (20+) came out incredibly quickly.

Full disclosure: Parking is a chore but, it's LA, and Guelaguetza is well worth the effort. (Ride sharing couldn't hurt though if you're close)< /text>

<rating>5</rating><Text>Exceedingly good for a small place in the middle of koreatown. The interior of the restaurant was very elegant, and I especially love the back of the restaurant. I would give a bonus for the interior. The live Oaxacan music was also great. Food was great, loved the chilaquiles and all the other entrees. The mole is probably the best in L.A, and I always buy their mole after visiting so I can make our homemade enchiladas. I always come here around once a month or so. Keep up the great work!<//Text><pics>None</pics><response>None</response>< gmap_id>

Unless you are in Oaxaca Mexico. You will find the most authentic Oaxacan food at this very friendly and confortable place. We had a pleasant and delightful time. it is clean and staff very knowledgeable of the dishes they serves. They even gave us a taste of some of their homemade moles.

Great place to eat!< /Text>

MÉXICO 🇲🇽
Eat the World LA review:
To the outsider unfamiliar with Los Angeles, the bright orange corner home of Guelaguetza might stand out a bit, both from its surroundings at one edge of Koreatown and also due to its bold color and architecture. As with many things in the area since the 1990's, the area was tilting Oaxacan just like large parts of Southern California, a demographic change strong enough to coin the term Oaxacalifornia.
°
When the restaurant needed to expand and moved here from its original tiny space, the new owners decided not to change the Korean building's exterior. But opening the door is like stepping into another world, even on overcast days the dining room seems filled with sunlight from the large central skylights while the walls are as colorful as Oaxaca itself and covered by the murals of a Oaxacan street art collective.
°
The husband and wife owners of Guelaguetza have since passed the restaurant down one generation to their children in 2014, who continue the cooking customs the place has been known for but also add a sense of advocacy for Oaxacan culture above and beyond the food that is served. A visit here is to be emerged in that, even casual diners will leave feeling more than when they entered the space.<//text>

<Pics>None</Pics><review>There's a lot of good hole in the wall and strip mall Mexican restaurants in Los Angeles but Guelagetza is a nice one that you could take your parents, boss or date to to celebrate a promotion or anniversary. There menu is extensive including tlayudas (Mexican pizzas?), Entrees with Mole (chocolate), seafood soup, enchiladas, taquitos and empanadas. And everything is good, I haven't been disappointed by any dishes. Also recommend their horchatas!</review><userid>101787538649469913739</userid>< name>

Ridiculous waiting time for standard food and service. One of the people in our party had their order wrong and I had a hair in my food. The musical entertainment seems like a good idea but the place is crowded and it can be obnoxiously loud.</Review>

Chips with mole to start, Okurrrttt!

Oaxaca's is what's on the menu. This place is just filled with eye catching and entertainment (live music). If I wasn't so hungover from the birthday celebration the night before I would have takin more photos lol.

As you walk in you are greeted and definitely ask to wait (not a long wait) for the next table available, this location is actually pretty big so the wait time goes by rather quickly. The have a good selection of things to purchase and shop while you wait.

Once seated you are welcomed with chips topped with mole sauce and these are unlimited (ask for more). The service was incredible, our drinks and food orders were immediately takin. The food came out rather quickly and the plates were so big (sharing is definitely an option).

Of course I'm used to Mexican style food and flavors but these dishes all had great and unique flavors I have never tried dishes from Oaxaca but will love to enjoy it again soon.

Thank you for the Birthday Flan and Birthday Pin! You guys ROCK!

Give this place a try!

Just an FYI there is street parking if you are able to find a spot but they also have valet parking for only $5.<//Review>

There's a lot of good hole in the wall and strip mall Mexican restaurants in Los Angeles but Guelagetza is a nice one that you could take your parents, boss or date to to celebrate a promotion or anniversary. There menu is extensive including tlayudas (Mexican pizzas?), Entrees with Mole (chocolate), seafood soup, enchiladas, taquitos and empanadas. And everything is good, I haven't been disappointed by any dishes. Also recommend their horchatas!<//Text>

I was told that it was a great food but I'm really disappointed, the meat to dry, chicken overcooked and dry as well, chorizo too much seasoning, what else can I say, didn't like at all<//review>

The prices are steep, the portions are small, the parking is bad, and the service is slow. The food is delicious and the atmosphere is nice. 3 stars is more than fair when compared to much better locations.</review>

Best Oaxacan food in LA. The atmosphere is also great. Four starts only because it gets really loud at times to the point where you can't even here your self speak. Otherwise the food and staff are great. LARGE plates!</text>

<Review>You haven't had mole or mezcal until you've visited Guelaguetza. A fantastic Oaxacan restaurant, this giant restaurant created a bit of an empire in Los Angeles. It's big, a little loud (they have music on weekend nights) and very cozy. You won't be out of place dolled up, or in jeans. It's a great LA restaurant where you can take a date or your family, and eat some of the best Mexican food in Los Angeles.</Review>< pics>

The accolades and awards that fill the walls of the entrance are a testament to the delicious mole that has been people coming back since 1994. I'm glad I made this my last stop before the airport.< /Review>

Good place that specializes in mexican food from Oaxaca. Their true specialty and what they are known for is their mole. They have several different types that they serve. If you have never tried mole before, this is one of the best places in the los angeles area to try it. Of course they also have many of the familiar mexican favorites like tacos and fajitas as well as seafood.  It also has live bands a full bar and is a large restaurant for big groups I would highly recommend.< /Text>

< Review>
$$$$
I love the atmosphere and the live band was awesome! The waiter was rude and the food is extremely over priced. I ordered a carne asada plate (they have a fancy name for it) but it was very disappointing. The plate was all salad! It had thinly sliced grilled beef, two spoon-fulls of rice and all the rest was salad. My table was 4 adults and 2 children and they added a gratuity fee to our bill. Very disappointed.< /Review>

I  love this place.  The food is excellent and delicious.  I'm hooked on the Chapulines Mexicana.  Its a spicy for me. But I love it so much. Its always a crowd brewing I'm and out.  With a live band going in the evening, its a party!!!!!  I think the drinks are divine.  Dont drink and drive...  Please go and visit.  Its wornt every penny....</text>

Guelaguetza was one of the first Oaxacan restaurants to open in Los Angeles, exposing denizens to the glory of the region’s mole and mezcal. Guelaguetza makes a great mole negro and good quality guacamole, as well as very good tamales de rajas. Highly recommend!</review>

Waited over two hours for a table (when they tried to tell us it would only be one). When we did finally get a table and got our food, my mom found several hairs from the kitchen staff in her plate. I ordered the empanadas de verde and was very disappointed. It was super spicy but bland; it was almost inedible. But, the manager did come over after the meal and apologized for our experience and comped the whole bill for us (rather then just my mom’s plate). So 1 star for his great customer service and 1 star for our waiter understanding my gluten allergy. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have much interest in returning.< /text>

This was my wife and my first experience with mole. We had the mole sampler, which comes with 4 varieties of chicken mole. If you don't mind sweet sauce, it's very good.< /Review>

The Queso Fundido(DELICIOUS) arrived before our drinks. Shortly thereafter our main course arrived. This place specializes in Molé. Everything was good. My only real issue was that they are too good. I do like to relax and take my time....  I felt rushed from the second my name was called. Food alone it would be more than 3 stars but overall experience brings that down a notch.</review>< Pictures>

Bring a date here. Live music at night and meals the size of TWO heads. Ask for an extra order of the chips&mole they give you upon arriving; you will dream about that mole.<//text>

<date>1448420241177<//date><text>In Los Angeles, Guelaguetza is synonymous with Oaxacan food. Since it moved from its original location a few blocks away on 8th street (not a particularly ambitious move, geographically speaking) Guelaguetza has expanded and added entertainment, while keeping the same amazing, spicy, southern Mexican specialties that made it successful.
Three kinds of mole (red, brown, and yellow, all fabulous, though the cumin-heavy yellow is an acquired taste), smokey mescal margaritas, black beans (instead of pinto), chicken/nut/raisin stuffed chiles... everything is great.<//text><Rating>5< /Rating>< user_name>

<Review>I wish I could give it 5 stars but my experience at this place wasn't good at all. First of all me and my family had to wait almost an hour to get table, then the food was cold. I ordered the All meat plate and it came with half of the plate fill with salad and the carne asada, chorizo and adobada were like they had just been taken out of the fridge. Honestly this place is overrated.< /Review><userid>113005725590788167193< /userid></record></dataset><record>

The tour de mole is awesome, it is 5 small servings of different types of mole, which will help you give you a taste of the variety of moles form this region of Mexico. The tlayudas are like Mexican pizzas, that's all I have to say about that.
Go for dinner and with an empty stomach, cause you will do a lot of eating here.
I would recommend sitting in the back area of the restaurant if you intend on having a conversation with your party, since they do have a live band play there on the weekend and it can get a bit loud.< /review>< Pics>

My god do I love this place. If you like Oaxacan mole, this place has them all. The tour de mole is awesome, it is 5 small servings of different types of mole, which will help you give you a taste of the variety of moles form this region of Mexico. The tlayudas are like Mexican pizzas, that's all I have to say about that.
Go for dinner and with an empty stomach, cause you will do a lot of eating here.
I would recommend sitting in the back area of the restaurant if you intend on having a conversation with your party, since they do have a live band play there on the weekend and it can get a bit loud.</review>

<text>Visited this restaurant on my last night in Los Angeles. Truly was a cherry on top of the night before heading to the airport. The food was unlike any other mexican food I have tried. I raved to my family back in jersey about this place. The nachos are wonderful and that sauce is so delectable. . The horchata was so unique as well as the tamarindo water was truly wonderful in taste.  I go crazy for mole sauce. Thats why I ordered a mole tamal and we even took some food back on the plane. I even had my mom tried some when I got home to NJ. She said it tasted delicious!! The vibe was just right. A musical band played salsa songs I grew up with and they sang happy birthday to me. Our server was wonderful and one of the sweetest servers I have ever had. I think about this restaurant everyday back home and how many times I would go to it if I lived in LA lol.<//text><UserId.>116479905850895874186</UserId.>< pictures>

I ordered the "Alambre", , which I have ordered before, and the plate I was served was almost all onions & bell peppers,  with very little MEAT!!  They charged  $16.50, which is aLOT, for about 3 ozs. of meat.
I think the high Zagat rating went to their heads! !< /text><user>104929744993530657044</user><pictures>None<//pictures>< Rating>

< Review>
Wow!!! I'm in love with the red mole (Coloradito) smothering a huge chicken breast and "string" cheese (queso oxaqueño). Traditional Oxacan food that will make your mouth water. Drinks are great- get a Mezcal sampler and the service great. I can't say anything bad or mediocre about this place. Also has a little gift shop where you can buy mole, jewelery or breads. Live music most nights. The music tends to be a bit loud if you sit in the front. If you want conversation, try to sit in the back, slightly raised level. You will not regret eating here!< /Review>

being excited to finally come here it was a huge disappointment. i do not get it. arriving there you have to pay $3.50 to park, valet only. and, this place is located next to so many apartment buildings residential and no where to park. i did pay valet. the wait time was 30 min. the menus were somewhat unclear written in Spanish which is okay and English below. i ordered a popular pizza-esque entre and it was not good at all. the flavor was bizarre. i asked the waiter that i would rather go with the chile relleno instead and was really good. but before i got it i had to pay for what the pizza dish costed which was $7 more. so why did i had to pay for the price of something that was horrible. now you know why its 1 star. then i also ordered their carne asada entree as well. i was horrified that i got an extremely thin slice of carne asada and taste was not good at all actually. the plate was full of salad and there was green leaf that was very nasty 🤢 and definitely did not belong. the rice was also horrendous that flavor had a nasty mint taste that did not make any sense. the beans was good. the handmade tortillas was cold and very STALE this is the word. the coffee was perfect i have to admit. the complimentary chips and mole and cotija cheese is really good. I WAS EXPECTING A DYNAMITE EXPERIENCE BUT IT TURNED OUT IT WAS HUGE DISASTER COMING HERE. the server was mostly awol. the prices are really expensive and not worth sacrificing trying this place over a couple of small details.</text>

<text>Horrible! I'm Mexican and ordered tamales con rajas which doesn't have rajas, it's just a slide of chile jalapeño. Rajas means slices of chile poblano not slices of jalapeño. I also ate entomatadas and the cheese looked like glue. I also tried the alambres which as a Mexican I can tell you that those are not alambres (kebab) those are pretty much tacos and the tortillas were wet on oil. I vomit my whole food after a couple of hours.</text><Rate>1</Rate><date>1475110952591<//date>< Gmap_id>

Rajas means slices of chile poblano not slices of jalapeño. I also ate entomatadas and the cheese looked like glue. I also tried the alambres which as a Mexican I can tell you that those are not alambres (kebab) those are pretty much tacos and the tortillas were wet on oil.

<text>I went to Guelaguetza for one specific reason, the fried grasshoppers or champulines in Spanish and on the menu. Prior to ordering the champulines, we were greeted with chips and mole. I'm not a fan of mole, but the mole we were served was sweet with a hint of spice that went well with the chips. My friend and I ordered a couple of margaritas, which were big and strong. The champulines come in either as an appetizer or an entree. Since we just wanted to try them, we went with the appetizer which was still a large amount along with a side of tortillas. The champulines are light and crispy with a definite kick. I asked for a salsa on the side, which also added to the flavor, but they would have been fine with just the lime included.

I also ordered the Tlyuda Choriqueso, which can be confused as a Mexican Pizza, but it's definitely more than that. It's really big, so I would recommend sharing any of the Tlyuda options. The restaurant is quite large and offer live music. Parking is an issue, which the restaurant offers valet service, but I found free parking down the block.< /text></record></dataset><record>

Where do you get the best mole this side of Oaxaca? In the middle of Koreatown of course. Guelaguetza's delicious mole will win over even the staunchest 'I know Mexican food' critics. The menu is packed with a variety of options for mole but the mole coloradito stole my heart from day 1. If you're planning on visiting during the weekend, be prepared to wait, as this location is quite popular. The basket of chips with mole coloradito that they deliver to your table when you finally get seated though makes the wait worthwhile. Get the chicken enchiladas if you're not adventurous, you won't regret it.</Text>

<Rating>1< /Rating><review>First of all, there is valet parking only. Then, it took over an hour and a half to get seated. After that, about 15 minutes to get drinks. Then about another 40+ minutes to get my food. I order Chiles rellenos, and it was EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTING. $17 for 2 chiles rellenos, beans, and a scoop of rice. For the wait time to get seated and served, I expected much better food.

I am not lying when I say that my mom makes better Chiles Rellenos in half the time. The rice is tasteless. The only good thing was the chips with mole. My buddy order tacos, he got more salad than tacos. Then the other guy got some quesadilla stuff that tasted like cotton.

I have never been disappointed about Mexican food until today. But at least the live music was good.<//review>< pics>

<Text>This place has awesome food. We ordered the Enmoladas and they were delicious. The chips they give with the red mole and cheese are so good. The horchata water is not just plain ole orchata. It has nuts and melon in it, so delicious. The service has always been good always very atentive. They even have live music. I would check their schedule and do reservations for the live music show.</Text><Gmap_id>0x80c2b87f94d62329:0xe605cc1bb679a2ac< /Gmap_id><user_id>108230588897777530512<//user_id><pictures>None< /pictures><user_name>Jessica Pational<//user_name>< Response>

<text>I as a who cooks real oaxacan food can tell this is the worst place i've been, the m Oaxaqueno ole was nasty, i've never tasted anything like that, not even the first one i made, the service was poor, me as a client wouldn't like to get back there,  the table i was sitted on was closed to a door that was suposed to be locked, a prostitute came in by that door and started screaming and yelling at everybody around and nobody did nothing. and something to note, if you go wash your hands you will notice that there is not napkins, nor even toilet paper, more over if you are eating and the only napkin they give you is not enough if you ask for more, they will just give you once, and don't worry to complain, they wont hear you, because they are too conceited about the place i guess. (sorry per the poor english i hope this works for you, and if you are looking for real oaxacan food, try to go to Oaxaca, you will love that place)</text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

<date>1509048104974<//date><rating>1< /rating><review>This place is a rip off, with rude servers, or at least the server who served me was rude, foolish and deceptive.
I was with my girlfriend and her mom, we went to that place, and by it's location, we thought that it should be affordable, as we were not planning on a formal lunch, just to grab something to keep us going, we were busy,
I did not look at what my girlfriend and her mother ordered, it was meat dishes, I'm vegetarian, so I asked for a salad, when the order came, it was a very large, thin crusted pizza, with few veggies on it, I thought that it was a mistake, I called the server and told him that I requested a " SALAD",  he answered me, this is a salad, I said, this is a pizza, and it's too large for one person, he insisted that the pizza was a salad, I did not want to create any inconvenience or a public scene out of respect for my girlfriend and her mom, but I left totally feeling like a fool, and the bill was about $ 124, added to the mandatory valet parking.
I give them zero, or below zero, we are in the USA.</review>< Pictures>

<Text>Well I would have given it a 2 1/2 stars but you really can't here. Food was okay which is really heart breaking because it use to be a really good place to eat, but now its not really worth the wait for the food and on top of it it was so so so hot inside the restaurant! We told our waiter and he sed that it was this hot because of the kitchen 😑 really!!!!< /Text>< Pics>

Food is ok, the only problem i  had is the service from the server, the server is not very helpful, it wasent busy and when you ask for something they just say yes, but never bring the stuff you asked for, the funny thing is that  they expecting a good tip all the time.<//Text>

(Translated by Google) Terrible table reservation service, they tell you 20 to 25 minutes and it took 1 hour 30, really they train the staff, I wanted to have a nice dinner, but they really leave a lot to be desired, if you have 4 unoccupied tables then give it to another person . Do not just stare at your client who already has hours, act. To return, forget it ...

(Original)
Pésimo servicio en reserva de mesa , te dicen 20 a 25 minutos y se llevó 1 hora 30 , de verdad que capaciten al personal , quería tener una cena agradable , pero de verdad que dejan mucho que desear , si tienes 4 mesas desocupadas pues dáselo a otra persona . No nada más se les queden mirando a tu cliente que ya tiene horas, actúa.  Para volver olvidenlo ....< /text>

(Translated by Google) The customer service is terrible, I spoke 3 weeks ago to ask for information about the place, I had plans to have dinner at this place with my wife to celebrate her birthday, today I called for the second time for information, they told me I had to be in the place to be able to reserve, and they also told me that they closed at 10 pm, I arrived at the place at 9 pm, and they told the person who is making the reservations that it was already closed, and that if I wanted to reserve I had to do it with 3 weeks in advance, I told him I spoke 2 weeks ago and a while ago to get information about the place and they never told me that, I told him we came from far away, let us in, he answered no.
Thanks to their poor service, I found Oaxacan flavors, excellent service, and food.

El servicio al cliente es pésimo, hablé hace 3 semanas para pedir información del lugar, tenía planes de cenar en este lugar con mi esposa para celebrar su cumpleaños, el día de hoy llamé por segunda vez para información, me dijeron que tenía que estar en el lugar para poder reservar, y también me dijeron que cerraban a las 10 pm, llegué al lugar a las 9 pm, y me dijo al persona que está haciendo las reservaciones que ya estaba cerrado, y que si quería reservar tenía que hacerlo con 3 semanas de anticipación, le dije hablé hace 2 semanas y hace rato para tener información del lugar y nunca me dijeron eso, le dije venimos de lejos, déjanos entrar, me contestó que no.
Gracias a su mal servicio, me encontré a sabores oaxaqueños, un excelente servicio y comida.

(Translated by Google) I have been to this place many times and I like the food,
But today was one of the worst 2 and a half experiences waiting for us to sit down with the woman who was the manager and she only told us I understand but she never gave us a table after waiting almost 3 hours we decided to leave I think this woman should not be driving this business is not
She is trained for that.

He ido muchas veces a este lugar y me gusta la comida ,
Pero hoy fue una de las peores experiencias 2y media esperando que nos sentaran able con la mujer que estaba de manager y solo nos decía yo entiendo pero nuca nos dio mesa después de esperar casi 3 horas decidimos irnos creo que esta mujer no deveria estar manejando este negocio no es
ta capacitada para eso.</text>

(Translated by Google) The worst service received. Here they take care of reservations while the people who arrive make us wait 3 hours to sit down. More than 1 hour for the food to arrive at your table. They are very poorly organized. They have clients sitting for 3 hours without consuming and they do not pick them up or attract their attention. They should not accept exceptions. We all have the right to good service and you will not find it here.

(Original)
El peor servicio recibido. Aqui atienden puras reservaciones mientras la gente que llegamos nos hacen esperar 3 horas para sentarnos. Mas aparte 1 hora para que llegue la comida a tu mesa. Estan muy mal organizados. Tienen clientes sentados 3 horas sin consumir y no los levantan ni les llaman la atencion. No deverian aceptar resepciones. Todos tenemos derecho a un buen servicio y aqui no lo encontraras .<//Review>

(Translated by Google) They gave me the wrong order, I asked for hot sauce they told me what they didn't have I can't understand why in a Mexican restaurant they don't have spicy I asked for a second drink they took a long time to bring it terrible service the truth was not worth driving from Anaheim to eat in this place I would not return again not as a joke.

(Original)
Me dieron la orden equivocada,pedi salsa picante me dijeron qué no tenían no puedo entender qué en un restaurante mexicano no tengan picante pedi una segunda bebida tardaron en traerla servicio pesimo la verdad no valió la pena manejar desde Anaheim para comer en éste lugar no regresaria otra vez ni de broma.< /text>

<Rating>1< /Rating><review>(Translated by Google) I did not like the $ 16 horchata, one has to prepare it at home, the nopales salad was salty, the tlayuda expensive and it did not have much cheese, the truth is, it does not matter to pay whatever it is, but they serve well but here it is expensive and badly served very bad. bad

(Translated by Google) One of my favorite restaurants in Los Angeles. The service is very good and the food fabulous. Good prices and portions.

During COVID-19 they have taken good measures, such as outdoor tables and free parking.

Highly recommended.

(Translated by Google) Well, good morning to all the people, my comment is that before the food was delicious but this time we went with my husband and my grandson we could not eat the very toasted fish, the very salted beans and the snack we ordered looked like very hard flip-flops. tacos and everything else did not work, nor did the filling seem like I was eating curd butter in the cakes that they serve you in the snacks, it is something incervible I brought it and threw it in the trash it hurt my stomach I'm sorry and God forgive me But for only three things they charged us $ 190 too expensive for only two people I was given a lot of money for something that did not work but thank you and God bless you very much Amen

pues muy buenos días a todos las personas yo mi comentario es que antes la comida estaba riquísima pero esta vez que fuimos con mi esposo y mi nieto no pudimos comer el pescado muy tostado los frijoles muy eladados y la botana que pedimos parecía chancleta muy duras los tacos y todo lo demás no servía ni el relleno parecía que estaba comiendo manteca cuajada en los pastelitos que te sirven en las botanas es algo incervible yo me lo traje y lo tire a la basura me dolió asta el estómago lo siento y que dios me perdone pero solo por tres cosas nos cobraron$190 dólares demasiado caro solo para dos personas se me iso mucho dinero para algo que no sirvió pero gracias y que dios me los bendiga mucho amén<//Review>

<Review>(Translated by Google) All the dishes are very rich, taste, texture, smell, everything was to the liking of the palate, the place is highly recommended, if you have the opportunity to visit this place, do not hesitate, go and enjoy the Mexican food (Oaxacan and traditional) that they offer.

And bon appetit

< Review>
(Translated by Google) Los Angeles stoked course, the first fitting and Smiley.Clark tacos, depending on the type recommended by acquaintances very high rating for a local place. Live party music comes out as 'American Chef' feels !!! (It is a little dark cabaret gatgido) if not familiar with the culture, and just as noisy places, and enjoy the best side dinner place.

Nachos, which appear like bread before a meal, are one of the best flavors in Korea. Especially chocolate sauce that enhances the taste of nachos. It doesn't taste chocolate. Sweet, but not chocolate flavor. The color is also red. Let's eat a lot of bread before eating the main dish and think about the main dishes.

I went with six people and played the family set 'Botana Oaxaqueña'. This is an hors d'oeuvre, but I did not eat anything else with the Full Plater, but I gathered it mainly in meat and came out in a big dish. It can be a little bit different depending on your taste. It seems to be especially meat, but if its color is green, it is a cactus.

(Original)
로스앤젤레스에 왔으면 당연히 첫 끼는 타코를 먹어야지 하며, 지인 형의 추천에 따라 현지인의 별점이 매우 높다는 이 곳. '아메리칸 셰프'의 느낌대로 라이브 파티 음악이 나오는!!! (좀 어두워서 카바레 같기도 하다) 이 문화에 익숙하지 못하다면, 그저 시끄러운 곳으로, 즐긴다면 최고의 저녁 식사 장소다.

식전 빵 처럼 나오는 나초는 한국에서 즐길 수 없는 최고의 맛이다. 특히 나초의 맛을 더욱 끌어올리는 초콜릿 소스가. 초콜릿 맛이 안난다. 달기는 한데 초콜릿 맛이 아니다. 색도 붉다. 식전 빵 많이 먹고 메인 디쉬 못 먹듯이 나초 적당히 먹고 메인 요리 생각하자...!

여섯 명이서 갔는데 패밀리 세트 'Botana Oaxaqueña'를 시켰다. 이거는 전채요리인데 Full Plater를 시켜서 다른건 못 먹어봤으나 고기 위주로 모아서 큰 디쉬에 나왔는데 또르띠야에 과카몰리 소스를 발라 쌈 처럼 싸 먹으니 본인은 대 만족! 취향에 따라서 조금 갈릴 수는 있다. 특히 고기인 것 같은데 그 색이 초록색이라면, 그것은 선인장이다.<//Review>

(Translated by Google) Family restaurant ✌ the food especially him mole negro (enmoladas) and he coloradito very rich. If you go on Sunday there will be a lot of people you will have to wait about 15 to 30 min. If you go by car, they have Valet Parking service. Live music playing with marimba.

The "bad" if you have children and carry them in strollers, you will NOT be able to enter with the stroller.

In general the experience is very good 👌

I would return again ... Yes ✌

(Original)
Restaurante familiar ✌ la comida en especial él mole negro (enmoladas) y él coloradito muy ricos. Si vas en Domingo habrá mucha gente tendrás que esperar como 15 a 30 min. Si vas en auto, tienen servicio de Valet Parking. Música en vivo tocando con marimba.

Lo "malo" si tienes niños y los llevas en carreolas , NO podrás entrar con la carreola.

En general la experiencia es muy buena 👌

Volvería a regresar... Si ✌</Text>

(Translated by Google) We are very disappointed why we asked for a complete Oaxaca snack that costs $ 110 and they took the small one and we told them that this order was not the complete order, the manager checked it and then told us that we would complete it with an extra plate of food. Which they said gave us courtesy. That the chef said the order was heavy. But we realized that the orders that came out for other tables were fuller or complete and they gave us half for a complete one. Very bad service even though we really like the food today we have been disappointed. This happened from 1 to 3 in the afternoon and the mornings were not sung to the celebrated😅😐 very poorly attended😓

(Original)
Estamos muy decepcionados por qué pedimos una botana Oaxaqueña completa que cuesta $110 y llevaron la pequeña y nosotros les dijimos que esa orden no era la orden completa, la reviso el manager y después nos dijo que nos la iba a completar con plato extra de comida. Que según ellos nos la daba de cortesía. Que el chef dijo que la orden iba pesada. Pero nosotros nos dimos cuenta que las órdenes que salieron para otras mesas iban más llenas o sea completas y a nosotros nos dieron la mitad por una completa. Muy mal servicio a pesar que nos gusta mucho la comida hoy nos han decepcionado. Esto pasó de 1 a 3 de la tarde y no le cantaron las mañanitas al festejado😅😐 muy mal atendidos😓<//review>

(Translated by Google) The food has no flavor the quesillo was already bad. The service is passable. They need to improve with food and be more authentic. before, two years ago they had better service and better flavor. Price does not matter when the product is excellent. I hope and improve, it is the only restaurant that boasts my friends but I no longer experience it because of the experience we had two weeks ago.

(Original)
La comida no tiene sabor el quesillo ya estaba mala. El servicio es pasable. Nesecitan mejorar con la comida y ser mas autenticos. antes, hace dos años atras tenian mejor servicio y mejor savor.

(Translated by Google) To my point of view very bad in these times before the waiters and waitresses were Oaxacan that is the most ovio but haora questions about the food and do not know why they are Central American. Now the tortillas are from the factory when before they were handmade, the water of horchata has colorant instead of snow of tuna, the black mole is too sweet and the chicken is overcooked. The rice could not be broken, it was too massive.

(Original)
A mi punto de vista muy mal en estos tiempos antes los meseros y meseras eran oaxaqueñas que es lo mas ovio pero haora les preguntas sobre la comida y no saben por que son centro americanas. Ahora las tortillas son de fabrica cuando antes eran a mano el agua de horchata  tiene colorante en ves de nieve de tuna el mole negro demaciado dulce y el pollo demaciado sobrecocido . El arroz  no se podia desboronar era demasiado masudo.< /text>

(Translated by Google) In my opinion, the best Oaxacan food restaurant in all of California. Whenever I visit California this is my favorite stop. The best dishes, the water of tuna and its desserts are the best in the world. I love everything about this place. ☆☆☆☆☆

(Translated by Google) Friendly and fast service. The mangoneada is very good, excellent preparation. Eat a Guelaguetza tlayuda. Very rich, although the chorizo ​​leaves a little to be desired in terms of flavor. The overall experience is good, 4/5 for the chorizo ​​and the overall price / value ratio.

(Translated by Google) delicious Oaxacan food without a doubt, my only complaint is about customer service employees seem to hate to work do not smile or mistaken and take care of bad, to start receiving you do it reluctantly as if you want if you do not take , waiters to hurry to order that I'm busy, I just keep going because my wife likes the mole there if I never had never returned

(Original)
riquisima comida oaxaqueña sin duda alguna, mi unica queja es sobre el servicio al cliente los empleados parecen que odian trabajar no sonrien ni por equivocasion y te atienden de malas, para empezar los que te reciven lo hacen de mala gana como si quieres si no largate, los meseros a si de apurate a ordenar que estoy ocupado, solo sigo llendo por que mi esposa le gusta el mole de ahi si no jamas hubiera regresado nunca</text>

(Translated by Google) All right, just that I was a skinny waitress with a low waist. I dried a lot and her hair was loose. She had to turn around and see if she tied it because it falls in the rich clayudas ...

<Review>(Translated by Google) Hmm? I don't know what happened but about 10 years ago the seasoning of this place was very good! But from about 4 years to today the taste of their food has dropped a lot! I don't know if they changed the chef or supplier of the ingredients? Before the taste was better, today I give it from 1 to 10 a 7

< Review>
(Translated by Google) It complies very well with expectations, the Tlayudas could be better prepared, more seat and more meat.
The water of chilacayota very well.
You can buy objects and clothes typical of Oaxaca.
The menu is varied.
In general, it is a very good Oaxacan option in LA.

There is a lot of Mexican eating but I doubt that this place represents the food of Oaxaca. I have eaten in Mexico and I assure you that Mexican food is very good.
I recommend you not to go there. What if the.mozo Jose is.very attentive. So I preferred not to bother him. But that does not imply that I do not oppose myself so that the public knows that if they go they are not eating something well prepared or something that is representative of Mexico, beautiful and beautiful.

La comida muy insipida con mala sazon. Hay mucho mexicano comiendo pero dudo mucho que este lugar reprsente la comida de oaxaca. Yo he comido en mexico y les aseguro que la comida mexicana es muy buena.
Les.recomiendo no.ir alla. Lo que si el.mozo jose es.muy atento. Asi que preferi no incomodarlo. Pero eso no implica que no de mi oponion a fin de que el.publico sepa que en caso de ir no estan comiendo algo bien preparado o algo que sea representativo de Mexico lindo y hermoso</review><rate>1<//rate>< userid>

(Translated by Google) The food was very tasty, it is definitely the taste of Mexico. The waiters very friendly. The wait was a little long 30 min, so they brought the food to the table. The restaurant was very crowded. But if you make a reservation days before you don't have to wait to get your table. You just wait a few minutes. And you can wait for your food sitting at your table enjoying your drink. 100% recommended. In addition, the dishes are very well served.

(Original)
La comida estaba muy rica,es  el sabor de México definitivamente. Los meseros muy amables. La espera fue un poco larga 30 min, para que nos trajeran la comida a la mesa. Estaba muy lleno el restaurant. Pero si haces reservación dias antes no tienes q esperar para q te den tu mesa. Solo esperas unos minutos. Y puedes esperar tu comida sentado en tu mesa disfrutando tu bebida. 100% recomendado. Ademas los platos estas muy bien servidos.< /text>

(Translated by Google) the food tastes great and deserves 5 stars. Unfortunately another of the very important things about a restaurant apart from the taste of the food is the service and this time it is bad. that's why I could only put 3 stars. I have noticed that several people are keen about the same thing and we hope that the owner can do something about it to help himself.

(Translated by Google) The place is very good, the waiting time is long, we are even going well, I understand that there are many people and more on Sunday, but the attitude of one of the hosstes is very bad, I am not generalizing but one of them is really very rude. I do not know its name but it is the highest of all. I have already come several times and this is the first time this has happened to me, so I have returned. From my heart do not happen again.

(Original)
El lugar muy bueno, el tiempo de espera si es largo, hasta vamos bien, entiendo que haya mucha gente y mas en Domingo, pero la actitud de una de las hosstes es muy mala, no estoy generalizando pero una de ellas de verdad es muy grosera. Desconozco su nombre pero es la mas alta de todas. Ya he venido varias veces y es la primera vez que me pasa esto,  por eso he regresado. De corazon no vuelva a pasar esto.</review>

<review>(Translated by Google) Little disappointed. The waiter service is not very good, forgot to bring chips, forgot to offer refills even when asked. The quality of the food has decreased, some dishes are still rich but the meat is not fresh and some food has no flavor. The prices towards the high side that it does not matter to pay it if the flavor is typical. What a shame that in the parking lot having spaces available is only for customers willing to pay more, my mother had to go down and wait with the little grandchildren at the door for me to go find parking in the middle of the street when there were free spaces.

(Original)
Poco desilucionada. El servicio del mesero no my bueno, olvido traer chips, olvidaba ofrecer refills aun cuando se le pedia. Han bajado en calidad en la comida, algunos platillos todavia ricos pero la carne no fresca y alguna comida sin sabor. Los precios hacia el lado alto que no importa pagarlo si el sabor es tipico. Que lastima que en el estacionamiento habiendo espacios disponibles solo es para los clientes dispuestos a pagar mas, mi madre tuvo que bajar y esperar con los nietos pequeños en la puerta para yo ir a buscar estacionamiento a media calle cuando habia espacios libres.</review>< response>

(Translated by Google) Delicious Oaxaca food! It is interesting how this place automatically transports you to that Mexico with so many faces due to its food, drinks, typical costumes and music, the flavors of the food in this restaurant immediately place you precisely in Oaxaca with the loyalty of its seasoning even with ingredients brought from where these traditional dishes were born, it is important to indicate that the attention is very friendly breathing that Mexican air not only because of the language itself, but also because of the accent that reminds you of that state of the republic where you perceive that friendship left to whom Visit, it is a pleasure to be in a place like that where it also has a music group that enlivens your stay.

Comida de Oaxaca deliciosa!

(Translated by Google) Today we visited the Guelaguetza restaurant to celebrate my mother-in-law's birthday and we really had a bad experience, my mother-in-law found a hair in the stuffed chili, they missed my daughter's horchata, they forgot part of my order and the broth from Seafood tasted good but cold. We apologized but I really do not think I will visit them again.

(Translated by Google) One of the best restaurants in Los Angeles, California with Mexican flavor without a doubt is the Guelaguetza. Very good food with a great seasoning, and very delicious drinks.

<Text>(Translated by Google) Mm for my third vicita they haven't changed much It was not pleasant because it was the final of chivas and tigers we were waiting outside for the crowded we wanted to look a little at the screens but they took us out that you had to wait outside and then we went out since
Outside of that, he lacks friendliness for the client and a little training for the rocking chairs, you ask him about a dish and they are the same.

(Translated by Google) Horrible experience this time after waiting an hour on the street we received poor attention from the waiter. Very tasty food! With the poor service of the waiter, it leaves a lot to be desired ... if you want to have a glass of water, forget it, I never brought it to you and I asked for it 3 times, it will be because they don't charge you! I ordered micheladas and those if in less than 2 minutes brought them to me .. the excellent food! Waiters need better training and be more educated. With such a service do not expect to be left 10% 15% tip because that is not forgotten on the ticket ..

(Original)
horrible experiencia en esta ocasión después  de esperar una hora el la calle recivimos una mala atención por parte del mesero . La comida muy rica ! Con  el mal servicio del mesero deja mucho que desear...si quieres tomar un vaso de agua olvídalo nunca me la trajo y se lo pedí 3 veces será por q no te la cobran! Pedí micheladas y esas si en menos de 2 minutos me las trajo .. la comida exelente ! Los Meseros necesitan una mejor capacitación y ser más educados . Con un servicio así no esperen que se les deje el 10%15%de tip por que eso sí no se les olvida en el ticket..<//Text>

(Translated by Google) Excellent food, but very bad service. If you are thinking of going with your family and a baby, take into account that they prohibit the stroller or baby carriage from entering, even if there is enough space to accommodate it at the tables. As a solution, they offer totally inadequate and insecure baby chairs. After waiting 50 minutes for a table, we had to eat, carrying the baby in the arms, with the discomfort of the case and without offering any solution, rather seeing everything with indifference. For the record

(Original)
La comida excelente, pero el servicio muy malo. Si estan pensando en ir en familia y con algun Bebe, tomen en cuenta que Prohiben entrar el stroller o Carruaje del baby, aun habiendo espacio suficiente para acomodarlo en las mesas. Como solucion les ofrecen unas sillas de bebe totalmente inadecuadas e inseguras. Despues de hacernos Esperar 50 minutos por una mesa, tuvimos que comer, cargando al bebe en brazos, con la incomodidad del caso y sin ofrecernos ninguna solucion, mas bien viendo todo con indiferencia. For the record</review>

<text>(Translated by Google) Very disappointing for my first time and I think that the last and expensive is the first time I buy a giant toast with beans and cheese for almost $ 13.00 dollars ... there is a restaurant in Santa Ana called Casa Oaxaca is super good and the On weekends they have a buffet for $ 11.00 cheaper than the toast that I did not even end up eating everything and with fresh tlayudas I highly recommend them !!! and I did not mention the mole because it is the house specialty.
