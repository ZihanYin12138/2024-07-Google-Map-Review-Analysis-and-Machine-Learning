Bryan was prompt, knowledgeable and professional. He provided great follow up care suggestions. He never stopped once. He came in with a friendly open demeanor and was courteous, respectful and responsive throughout his time in our home. The carpet cleaning service itself was excellent and thorough. We will definitely use Clean Investment cleaning service for future projects and will recommend their team to others. Thank you!</text>

Carpet cleaning very good, but the grout cleaning is truly amazing! My tile looks brand new. I have used Stanley Steamer for 20+ years. Never again...I have a new carpet cleaner! Brian was absolutely fantastic! And my carpets are almost completely dry in hous, not days!<//text>

I spoke with Brian who was very helpful and patient with me as I asked many questions about the process for cleaning my specific chair (made of a unique fabric called Sisal, it turns out). Brian was the one who came out to do the cleaning, as well, and he did a fantastic job and was very quick. Very pleased with my experience, and will be coming back to them for rug cleaning in the future!</review>

<Review>This is a great company with fantastic service. The work they do is top quality and is highly recommendable. So much so, they will guarantee their work. We moved into a place that needed the carpets cleaned and the pet odor eliminated. They came out and did a great job but after some rain the pet smells came back. They came back out. They found a mildew issue under the carpet. They didn’t have to clean it, but they did. The sprayed mildew killer and shampooed the carpet again, for free. This is going to be our go to company from now on. When we have our twice yearly cleaning; it will be with Clean Investment. It’s a shame I can only give five stars.</Review>< pics>

Clean Investment was very professional, friendly and did a great job for a competitive price. They followed up to make sure the job was done well and to make sure all pet smells/stains didn’t resurface and did touch up
for free. By far the best service on every level I’ve ever had. Thank you so much for everything! We will definitely be calling you again when we need our carpets done.<//Text>

<text>Truly wonderful to work with, from start to finish! They were competitive with other local rates. I was texted an appointment confirmation within a few minutes of calling them. Brian was early to the appointment, and let me know when he was on his way. After I showed him the areas to be worked on, he gave me an estimate of when he would be finished, so I could leave and get some work done, which I GREATLY appreciated. Brian was professional, courteous, and above all, did an absolutely AMAZING job on my carpets. I had 2 pretty major stains in 2 different rooms, caused by my air purifier, that I had tried everything to get out with no luck, and now they are completely gone! I’m pretty sure the carpets look better now than they did when I first moved into the house! I highly recommend Brian and Clean Investment. I can’t say enough good things about them!!<//text><Pics>None</Pics>< date>

Clean Investment was amazing! Super easy to communicate with and extremely prompt service! Both Bryan’s were so professional and friendly! I have a new puppy and wasn’t sure we would ever get the smell of urine out of our carpet but Clean Investment got the job done! Should you need a carpet cleaning, please reach out to this company. You will not be disappointed! Thanks for the GREAT service and results!<//Text>

Moral of the story... just because you ask housecleaners to use only warm water on your porcelain title doesn’t mean they listen.    After this battle of watching my brand new tile get a build up and never felling like it was completely clean I called Clean Investment and Brian has my tile and grout looking like new!!  And of course my carpets look amazing too!  Highly highly recommend you give them a call.  Very professional and excellent communication.<//Review>

<user_id>106831410493074656865<//user_id><text>I am on the fence about my review. On one hand, I had a very nice, well kept, professional young man named Brian come out and give me a free estimate on my laminate flooring and tile. The estimate took awhile as we talked in depth about his ways of cleaning my floors. He assured me that he could get the job done. The price was high for us but I wanted it done professionally and correct. Upon arrival he immediately got to work on the tile and it came out amazing!
Then comes the laminate floors. The other hand. The reason this lovely review turns bad. He couldn't clean my flooring. He tried for 2 hours with a buffing style machine. I have always steam mopped and I swore that is what I signed up for? I guess it was miscommunication but I don't understand how he couldn't use water when I always have? The cost was greatly reduced because he wasn't able to finish which was nice, he was very nice but I am bummed that he took on the job but wouldn't/couldn't finish it. I would recommend only on tile and presentation alone. Brian was a gentlemen.</text><Date>1523658692947< /Date><Pictures>None</Pictures>< GmapID>

Outstanding service.  The best of the best.  We have used other carpet cleaners, but  nobody comes close to the quality service provided by Clean Investment.  They went above and beyond expectations. We moved into a house with a strong cat urine smell from the previous owner.  Now the carpets are clean and no more cat smell. Well done.</review>

<Text>This review is one over due. I've used this company twice now and the recent one they did just as good a job as the first time. They did however move up a bit in pricing but these are my guys from now on and they offer  a 6-month warranty on stain protector now for carpets. I highly recommend!!!< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None< /response>< gmapID>

Brian was great, super informative and kept lines of communication solid. We initially hired him to clean our tiled floors (porcelain) in our kitchen and did such an amazing job we hired him on the spot to do our carpets. We are extremely pleased with the results and would definitely recommend this company for any tile and carpet cleaning needs.</Review>

<Review>Bryan did a fabulous job. First of all he was very responsive in coming to our house within 24 hours of a call. He was extremely polite and punctual. But most importantly, he did an outstanding job. We had some very stubborn nasty grease stains that he got completely out. I would recommend him and his company to anyone.<//Review><Time>1537650656946< /Time>< GmapID>

My dog recently made got out of his kennel to make a mess of things and manage to chew my couch cushions to pieces then proceed to do his business on top of said pieces including the carpets. Bryan made the carpets like new and the smell is completely gone.<//Text>

I am happy to see a company take pride in its work and take such steps to insure that their clients feel comfortable in their own home and trust in their service. I am beyond grateful they took the extra time to protect, cover, and ask before they touched anything to keep all my belongings safe and sound. Long story short I would definitely trust these guys in my home if I ever had to leave them alone in it. The results came out great. This is the first but not the last time I will be calling them.<//review>

Bryan was great! I had such a terrible odor coming from our living room from previous pet stains and their neautralizer and super vaccum sucked up all the lingering urine. It was great to watch it disappear. The house smells great for the first time ever since we moved in. I'm so happy, thank you Bryan for your awesome customer service!</text>

Great service and friendly people. This is where you should go for all your regular maintenance such as oil changes and air filters. While they are changing your oil they also check the other fluids and wash your windows. They informed me of my very dirty air filter as in the picture. I’m glad I got this taken care of before my road trip. Thanks again guys!< /review>

They checked it all. Washed the windows too.  Reminded me to come back in 90 days for a recheck and to top off the fluids if necessary. Nice 🙂< /text>

These guys treated me like royalty. Got an Oil change and they checked my tire pressure and cleaned my windshield while I waited in the car. I was in and out in less than 15 minutes. Highly recommend!< /Review>

This place is the best.  I was quoted over $600 for an oil change,  fuel filter, and water separation filter for my Ram 2500 Diesel from two different places.  Lube Express saved me over $300 and I did not have to make an appointment.  They also did a 20 point inspection.  The crew is also amazing.  I will never go any place else.</review>

These guys truly deserve each and every one of the 5/5 stars I rated them.  I arrived 10 mins before they closed last week for an oil change, but honestly was not expecting them to take me as they were in the midst of wrapping things up for the day.  However, to my surprise, they were more than happy to help me, and I was in and out of there with my oil, rear differential fluid, and air filter changed in less than 15 mins.  I normally would have only gotten an oil change, but I was aware beforehand of my car needing the air filter change and rear differential fluid change.  They did a great job of making sure I was comfortable with all services performed on my car, showing me side by side comparisons of my current air filter/differential fluid with new filter/fluid change.     Their customer service was impeccable with  competitive pricing for all services.<//Text>

2 other oil change places stated there was an issue with my oil plug and refused to service my vehicle. They told me I needed a mechanic to fix my oil plug. Lube Express saved me from a costly and unnecessary mechanic bill. Replaced my plug for free and made sure that nothing was stripped/damaged on my oil pan. Professional and efficient.</review>

I was barely pulling in and this man started yelling at me to slow down. I wasn't going fast and I told him there was no need to yell. His exact words "This is my shop." Horrible attitude and way to treat potential customers. I am never going back to this place.</text>

It was my 1st time there and did not have a great experience. The good thing I have to say about them is they are quick once your car's in the shop and there's not a lot of wait time before that. I wouldn't say their knowledgeable because one the employees lied to me about my air filter when I had just checked it before I went there. He said my air filter looked good when like I said I had just checked it and the outside of the air filter was coming apart noticeably. When I called him out on it his answer was well we don't have that type of air filter. Then start with that from the beginning don't lie to me. My girlfriend and I did have a good laugh about that lol. Because of that I would never recommend that place to anybody.</Text>

<Review>I have gone here twice now, service has been quick both times, in and out in less than 30 minutes (probably more like 20).  This last time they said my car needed 20 weight oil, and they only had that in synthetic, which meant the oil change would be $75.  This seemed a bit high to me, and I frankly felt a bit ripped off, but synthetic oil is generally pretty good and should last a lot longer between changes.

Not sure if they will let your bring your own oil in, but the pricing on the synthetic oil did seem a bit high to me.

I would recommend this place to friends, but I would suggest they check around to make sure they are getting a reasonable price first.</Review>< name>

<review>Went in with my girlfriend she told me about this place. You don't even have to get out of your viehicle if you don't want to. They'll bring the clip board to you in your car and you can fill out what ever and pick your oil or service. It was a really good experience. I had been going to a "Valero" oil change place and I won't be going there anymore. Thanks guys!</review>< pics>

<username>2nd MSOB</username><Review>I recently brought my wife's Honda in for an old change since the service light came on. After the service, we encountered an odd noise which was the result of the airbox which had to be fixed by a mechanic. The owner was went above and beyond by talking with the mechanic and working with me as a longtime customer of Lube Express. I can highly recommend them since you don't find many willing to go the extra mile and come to an agreeable compromise.</Review><time>1535478790790<//time>< Pics>

I'd like to start off this review by clarifying that I am an awkward 18 year who has manage to make a train wreck out of every conversation and I had never gotten my oil changed before so I knew I was going to screw something up. As I pulled in I couldn't find the entrance and as I was driving around trying to find it I could see some of the guys working there pointing at my car (probably because I pulled into the bowling alley I went in on the wrong side of the divider.) I finally noticed that I had turned right too soon and made my way to the entrance. When I got out I was greeted by friendly gentle man who said something along the lines of "we saw you driving around back there" and my response was supposed to be " yeah I'm an idiot, sorry I couldn't find you guys." What I actually said was "you idiot" (you know cause I'm stupid, and that's how I greet people) the dude was still nice though and took me to the waiting room where I called my dad to tell him what happened. He got cut off in the middle of the conversation and I realized I was still connected to my car speakers, and they probably heard him laughing about the "you idiot" thing. The guy came back in to take my form and apologized if I felt he was picking on me for getting confused about the entrance. I laughed and apologize for calling him and idiot and explained what I was really trying to say. After he left I could hear the rest of the team laughing behind the waiting room door. Anyway, they were done in like 10 minutes, everyone was super friendly, and  the price was pretty cheep. 10/10. Would definitely come here again.<//text>

I have been going to them for 10+ years and love them! They are always so nice to me and I never feel that they are taking advantage of me. Today I had lost track of time and needed to get my oil changed because I am going to Disneyland tomorrow. I pulled in at 4:58 and the close at 5:00, I did not think that they would take me, but they did!!! This meant so much to me because they did not have to do this. They were very nice about it and did not make me feel bad in anyway.</review>

I've been a customer here for 3 1/2 years. Up until this time NO complaints. I have 3 vehicles that I've brought in for various services. The last 2 times I have felt like the employee was pushing me to do services other than just an oil change. I don't care for that kind of interaction. They have risen there prices and no longer take oil. I expressed my concerns and the attitude I received was, too bad-take it or leave it. So with that I'll take my business elsewhere.<//text>

<text>Lube Express Response to Brandon.

Here are the facts:
1. Your wife has 2011 Subaru Outback and the transmission was serviced at 60,849 miles on 12/19/2013. The service was preformed two year and four months ago. Not one year ago.
2. The correct transmission fluid was installed in the transmission. QMI CVT 7000 multi vehicle fluid and the description in the notes section says “Trans fluid special” This fluid cover about 14 different vehicles types. Subaru CVT, Audi/VW, Ford, Honda ect. Therefore the part number in our system is called Trans Fluid Special. If you would like a copy of your wife’s receipt I will have one sent to you.
3. The manufacture recommended service interval as you state is “under server diving and towing conditions” you omit the mileage for that is at 24,855 miles. To say that the fluid should never be changed regardless if you challenge the mileage interval is clearly not true.
a. Fact-Changing the Transmission fluid will never cause one to fail. If some told you that to use your words they would be incompetent or liars.
4. Lube Express is owned and operated by an ASE Master Mechanic. In our 26 years of business this is not the first time we have had an unsubstantiated claim brought to us by a false statement from a third party dealer or mechanic.
a. The dealer mechanic you spoke to was not a Master Mechanic if he was he would never say what you claim he said. The service writer you spoke to is not a Master Mechanic they never are. These are low lever ASE certified techs making false statements they will never back up. They never do.
b. They told you that you should never change the fluid and we put the wrong fluid in the transmission. Have them put it in writing. They will hide behind their false statements and not put anything in writing.
c. They use FUD- Fear Uncertainty and Doubt to try and disqualify their competition.
i. This is unfortunate to lose a good customer over this type of false claim but I hope you will come to reason.
5. In my 26 years I have never had a customer not come in to discuss such a situation. This could have been easily cleared up if you had just come in and talked with us. Facebook is not the place to take false claims from third parties and claim they are the only truth.
6. We are still willing to discuss in person if you would like to come by.
In the future if you have a problem with us or any other business you should get both sides of the story before you take to social media and slander them.
Regards,
Lube Express

This has been the worse service ever. I went to get my nails done last week on 2/6 with Tony.  Less than a week later on Sunday both the gel paint in my thumbs peeled off completely. The following day the paint on my pinky began to peel too. I called Tuesday and spoke to the receptionist and she said I could go in to get it fixed. I go in the following morning around 9:20 and inform one of the girl there about my situation and she asked me to sit down that I would be helped shortly. Customers kept walking and were waiting to be helped but as time passed those customers who came in AFTER me were being helped before me. I let it slide but after waiting for half an hour and seeing everybody else was getting helped but me I started to get annoyed. The lady who had told me I’d be helped shortly asked me who had helped and when I told her she said he’d be there soon and handed me the basket to look for the color I had on. 15 minutes passed and workers started coming in and started to helped all the other customers who got there after me. I was so annoyed I walked out and called them to express my frustration. The man on the phone was absolutely no help claiming I had to wait for the person that did my nails last time.This by far has been the worse place I’ve ever been to. Not only extremely expensive, I paid 42$ for a damn fill  but customer service and quality lacks very much. It amazes me how in 45 minutes nobody could help me just refill 3 damn nails . I will make sure to never refer or come back to this place again because obviously they do not do anything to help their quality issues.<//review>

Hey guys don’t go here. Service was okay and mediocre but I got a fungal infection on my feet. I don’t have a sensitivity to absolutely anything and this started immediately after my pedicure. Please be careful I purchased an additional calluses remover and I noticed she just rinsed it with water and stored it in her box. I don’t remember her name but it was definitely seat number 7. Please be careful guys I have bumps and itchiness.<//Text>

<review>If you are in a rush, get your nails done at this place. Your feet and hands will get wet, barely cleaned up and ready to paint. The work that goes into the nails is very minimal. Dead skin is not properly removed. Painting is not good at all, looks bumpy and uneven. Even toe nails are not trimmed evenly.</review>< gmapID>

<Review>Clean, friendly. Very happy with how my nails were done. Great options to choose from in doing nails. Had a great pedicure. When I asked her to smooth my toenails a little bit she did it to the point of hurting my toes. I'm not sure how it made sense to her to file my nail down leaving it paper thin to the point where I bend it myself. I will go back for nails but no more. Too many excessive prices for everything.<//Review><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

Horrible service !!! They were very rude & disrespect. They tried charging me money after they had not done anything !

I told the lady TWICE what I wanted & she said to not worry about it when I mentioned it to her again she grabbed my hand & removed what she had done (in a aggressive way) & said it was going to be $5 when I was getting ready to pay that’s when someone else said it was fine .. if she was mad it wasn’t my fault.

<Rate>1</Rate><text>**updated** I felt a couple of nicks and cuts when the manicurist was working on my toes. A few days later my toes were hurting a lot as she had cut waaay to much cuticles. The skin around one of my toe nail was so thin that it cracked open and bled. This caused a few weeks of discomfort as it scabbed over and healed.

I love the big massage chairs for getting a pedicure. $18 for the spa pedicure. My manicurists did a good   Job but was on her phone the entire time.</text>< pics>

As I was waiting for a manicure which I let the host in the front know what I wanted to pay for I was rudely asked by a male nail tech if I was waiting for nothing after he started working on my friends fill and her fill alone cost $33 I ended up paying $25 with my gift card cause God knows I did not want to wait another hour for a manicure. I have an horrible experience where I waited over an hour to get one nail fixed. Save your time and money and go to any of the other nail salons. JP has recently become complete trash due to the loss of soon of its workers!<//text>

Due to the horrible service I've been encountering lately at JP Nails I MUST update my review. The workers at JP nails lately are in such a  rush they dont attend your nail needs appropriately . Lets also not forget how they are always changing prices one day you get charged one amount the next it changes to something higher and also some of the Gel polishes they use start chipping within less than 2 days of getting my Manicure done. Lets get it together JP.< /Review>

<Review>I have been a market researcher participant for Taylor for years. They treat their people professionally and with lots of personal attention. Their facilities are classy and comfortable with water and sometimes snacks to enjoy. Their people and clients are respectful and friendly in their Interaction with you. The compensation for your time and knowledge is more than adequate. I will continue to respond to their marketing requests for as long as they ask.
You will thoroughly enjoy your experience!</Review>< Pics>

I never get a call about participating in a study once I do the screener.  I've been a member for over a year.  Waste of time, decided to unsubscribe.<//review>

I participated in a focus group on Thursday Nov. 10th. When it ended and I asked for my $150 they said it will be paid on a later date. They said I should be receiving an e-mail or a phone call confirming my address and it would be mailed to me. Well, it's been 4 days and not only has NO ONE called me, I have left messages, no one has called me back, no e-mail has been sent to me. I called the woman who conducted the survey Thursday and she told me she would contact Taylor and let them know that I showed up for the study on time & completed it. Still......nothing. Not cool. I invested my time, gas money, and opinion to Taylor Market aresearxh and they have NOT paid me as promised. Be very cautious. No other research companies have ever been so unprofessional and not paid on the spot. This is a scam!< /review>

<Review>Been here a couple of times for focus groups and it's very clean and organized for the most part. Staff usually know what's going on and sometimes there's snacks in the lobby while we wait.< /Review>< Time>

Outside stand set up nightly (every night, but not 100% sure) right outside Walgreens near Smart & Final on Sherman Way. Great, fresh food at amazing prices. Always get the carne asada quesadilla, which is consistently good. They have a big table of salsas, onions, radishes, pickled veggies to choose from as much you need, although I'm not a big fan of touching large, shared spoons in times of Covid. There is a huge hand sanitizer nearby.< /Text>

Pretty fair prices for self-serve wash. They also have towelettes available incase you didn't bring any and exchange bills for dollar-coins, Neat.< /Review>

<Review>I've been going there for years. The equipment could use some updating and upgrading. But it serves the purpose. The stalls are sometimes extremely filthy. There's mud on the bay floor and you end up tracking that into your car after washing it in that mess.< /Review><Resp>None</Resp><Name>Tony C<//Name>< Gmap_id>

2 of my boys got their haircut from here. Curtis and Terry did an awesome job and The price is not bad at all. Very friendly staff and down to earth and even my younger son enjoyed just being there talking with them. This was their first time there and they all said they've never had such friendly and kind service at a barber shop and that these are genuinely kind people. This will definitely be their go to barber shop! Try not to listen to any bad reviews because those are just picky and unsatisfied people to begin with.<//Text>

If you are offended by barber banter - then this is not your place. If you are looking for the real deal - this is. It is loud, friendly and personable - all the things you expect from a busy place! If you aren't a fan - then you don't know what barber shops are about. The men in my wedding party all got their hairs did up, nice and clean! Thanks T< /text>

I needed a haircut so I walked and I was told there was a decent wait. I was okay with this but there is a pungent smell of weed and the barbers throw around the “n” word throughout my entire stay. I’m not 100% certain about this but some barbers cutting the hair could have been high. Fast forward to a little over an hour of my wait which is when I was told someone else is ahead of me when I was told earlier I would be next. Overall a terrible experience and could not recommend someone else this place.

Edit: First review ever because I felt this place really needed an honest review.</review>

Always an excellent haircut. At 81, I need something that is right. Trenton is laid back, but he listens. Chatter in the shop should be bottled and sold! A real experience not to be missed, and it includes a superb hair cut.</Text>

So we just stopped in since my son's hair was too long and were happy to find this place. They do great clipper work, if that is your thing. The only inconvenience is that they only take cash, not even personal checks. It's has that neighborhood barbershop feels, tons of Sports Illustrated, basketball on the flatscreen and you'll get at least one whiff of ganja along the way. Unique barber shop in the middle of the suburbs.</Text>

This is the only place I go to; I've had my hair cut by a lot of places in my 8+ years of military service, and this place is one of the best. The owner is a fantastic guy, he helps young men in the community and does talks at Stanford (where I met him). Anyways, if you want a good fade and contribute to an ethical business model, I'd suggest going here.<//Text>

<Review>Rude and unprofessional customer service. I show up on time for my appointment and my barber has someone else in his seat. When I ask him, if I had the appointment time right he said "yeah.." then had an attitude. Then when I asked if another barber could fit me in (because two were not cutting hair, empty seats.) The other barber said "Sorry, we don't to take other's clients." I obviously didnt want to be cit by him anymore. I was not rude or abrasive in anyway. Highly unprofessional all the way around.</Review><rating>1</rating></record></dataset><record>

But every time I went the barbershop were different.   The last time I went the one barber who wasn't busy decided he was going to lunch after asking me if I wanted a haircut.  I immediately searched the internet and found urban style,  which , to my surprise was awesome!!  Small intimate,  respectful,  fun, professional.   Appointments,  soft couches,  good music.  I love the place!  And haircuts are $15 for 65 and over!  They had so many different ethnicities there,  too! Urban Style forever!< /Review></record>

<Text>Worst barbershop I’ve ever been to. STAY AWAY. Romayne is the worst of them all! Go to him if you don’t mind getting your hairline pushed back 3 inches & if you have good hair he will do everything in his power to make sure you end up bald like him. Don’t bother telling him what kind of haircut your aiming to get either, he will do whatever he feels at that moment, even if it’s the complete opposite of what you asked for. Horrible customer service.

All in all, barbershop is highly unprofessional, barbers come in late all the time and leave before closing. Oh, and don’t try to see another barber if you aren’t satisfied with your previous haircut. They’re all extremely sensitive and they won’t cut other barbers clients. Why would a shop turn down money just because the customers wants to try out another barber??? Sounds like bad business to me.

There’s a real professional barbershop in Menlo Park. Sharp images hair care. Ask for Sedric & tell him Will Smith sent you 😁 If you’re tired of the unprofessionalism by Romayne, look no further. Sedric will take care of you!<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None</Response>< gmapID>

Went in, asked for a trim. They had the kid with headphones on do my hair, should have just walked out right then.  He butchered my hair.  No other way to describe it.  Kept trimming until there was almost nothing left.  I will NEVER go back.< /review><Gmap_id>0x808fba56344d3011:0x577f5f34dc8ba231<//Gmap_id></record>

Nice to be able to just walk in to a shop where there's years of experience for young and old who actually know what they are doing. A place where knowing how to fade is a must know by all their barbers. Thank you fellas! SLY</review>

<review>LACK ETHICS.
I needed a haircut and decided to checkout this place. It was busy and I had to rush back to work but I still decided to wait until my turn. So after waiting 30+ minutes, finally it was my turn but suddenly some guy entered the shop and told the barber that he had be somewhere and the barber looks at me and goes "He is next. He had an appointment" ---- I was pissed off for the fact that he had to lie instead he could have first checked with me if it was okay. Just because I didn't tell you does not mean I don't have to rush back somewhere. My time is valuable as well so I simply walked up to him and said "I had to be somewhere as well" and walked out of the place. They just lost a customer trying to please another....and for the wrong reason.
I will NOT give business to anyone who has no ethics...period.< /review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

If you ever stayed at a luxury hotel, the amenities offered and the level of service compares. I am a manager for a luxury hotel and the level of service my team provides is of that what was provided to me at Avalon Vista.  I have been at the Avalon Vista for 3+ years and the team here is amazing. I recently had a plumbing issue in my apartment and had the pleasure of dealing with Ernesto (Maintenance Tech I). His promptness and determination to get this issue resolved was astonishing to see and hear as he set my issue as his priority. If he wasn't able to solve the issue, he escalated it. If the escalation didn't work, he went back and attempted multiple times until he, himself got it right and resolved it himself. Now that is luxury service. Patrick (Tech III) and Ernesto were super communicative with me throughout the entire process and kept me in the loop at every step. I was never worried that they could not resolve this issue at all. I knew that they were committed to resolving it promptly and efficiently. This is a big thanks to the Tech Team, and especially Ernesto for his talents and commitment to the residents.  HUGE THANKS TEAM AVALON !!! Keep up that luxury type of service and beautiful grounds. EPIC JOB !!</text>

Beautiful place to live, I love it here, this is the first place my boyfriend and I have together, and it has just been such a wonderful experience, we adore the modern style buildings, also the gym is amazing, and pool too,  the whole complex is always extremely clean and tidy at all times, moving here has been so very welcoming, we have met many of the neighbors &  staff, specially at the gym in the mornings, that make the experience even more personalized and full of that home feeling, special shout out to Mina maintenance tech for her charm, and lovely vibes, always with a smile and a pleasant word every morning... everyone and everything about Avalon Vista is just so positive and fresh! And I fell so fortunate to call here home<//review>

If you are on the comments page and deciding to move In or not, just do it. Move in! I’ve moved in and out of apartments for a while now. However these apartments is by far the closest I felt to as a home. I had no problems with any of my neighbors or noise. It had a modern design that was clean and well kept. If you are working with Joseph and Patrick, you know you are in good hands. They were extremely helpful and professional when I needed anything from management or facilities.<//text>

I haven't been a renter for over 13 years. Looking at apartments, Avalon Vista stands above the others in the Vista area. Joseph made the entire process very easy for me from looking at priorities to helping me through the paper work to secure the lease and move in. My window for moving as a very short time frame, so having Joseph's exceptional service helps to further make Avalon Vista stand out and shine. I am not only impressed by the property but the welcoming of the employees at Avalon Vista.< /review>

<text>I just moved in at the Avalon here in Vista and it has been a phenomenal experience. Joseph Drewer has helped me from the day I signed my lease two months ago and through all the way to my move in date. Moving can be a very stressful time and Joseph took the edge right off for me. He was extremely patient with my questions and very accommodating with any concerns I had. Making Avalon my new home was due in part to Joseph’s dedication to this place and to all the other tenants. If you are looking for a beautiful modern complex that takes care of its tenants and its property, this is the place to call home.</text><name>Clark DiGregorio<//name><Time>1621004032432</Time>< response>

Joseph Drewer is very attentive and right on track.  I currently live in the Avalon Dublin, and am transferring to the Avalon Vista the beginning of April and Joseph has made this transition less stressful.  He is kind, and so very helpful.  He gets back to us when he says he will, which we do not get now.

Thank you so much Joseph for everything you have done.  We look forward to being in the Avalon Vista community and starting our new chapter.<//text>

We have lived here since 2015 and are still here!  The staff here are great and make living here really enjoyable.  Mina, the maintenance tech, is always super helpful and friendly.  She can always be seen around the community, keeping the shared amenities clean and ready for use.  Even with a global pandemic going on the staff at Avalon are still available and ready to help residents with any issues.  If you are looking for a place to call home, you should definitely check out Avalon Vista.  They make living here feel like its own community, with events throughout the year and even hosting local food trucks.  I love this place and all that is offerd, which is why I am still here and plan on staying here.< /text>

Honestly I love living here. We have a really unique unit with a corner balcony, access to a garage, and its just so pleasant. The unit is nice and big with tons of natural light, in-unit laundry, and hard floors (carpet in the bedroom). Nick and his team here try really hard to elevate the experience for the tenants, and it shows that they genuinely care about the people. I see some complaints in other reviews about noise or the cost, but thats what happens in apartments. Avalon always goes above and beyond and Nick and his team are simply the best.< /review>

Wonderful place to live.  Staff and Maintenance are outstanding individuals.  Notable mention for this week is,  Mina.  Dedicated, accentuates customer service and dedication to her position.  She brings a warm smile and happy disposition since meeting her on day one. She works relentlessly  to clean up the BBQ area which some participants seem to leave in disarray.  Everyone of the staff members at Avalon Vista is a phenomenal person. You've surpassed our expectations and thank you for your hard work and dedication!< /Review>

<Review>A large Thanks goes out to Ernesto Diaz of our maintenance crew. My thermostat started going goofy at 1:00 A.M. after six years of fine service. Turning on and off and finally caput. I placed a service request and first thing in the morning Ernesto was at my door after a phone call requesting  if it was alright to stop over with a new thermostat in hand . Already new what the problem was and in less then 1 minute the problem was solved on quite a chilly morning. Thanks again Ernesto and another great hire< /Review>< Pictures>

<response>None< /response><text>Where do I even begin! First of all, shout out to Dominique as she has guided me from beginning to end! She is the only reason why I leased with Avalon. I was apartment searching a few months ago and toured quite a few including Avalon, however Dominique was the only leasing agent that followed up with me! From there she informed me there was a unit available in my price range and I couldn’t pass up on the unit. From there, Dominique has exceed all my expectations and questions I had throughout the process. I never write reviews but I had to write one for her. I’ve lived in a few complexes and never had a leasing agent like Dominique! I moved in a week ago and so far so good. If you are considering Avalon I highly recommend working Dominique as she is knowledgeable, professional and provides great customer service!< /text><Gmap_id>0x80dc740369fe3cc7:0xb990789a0f972be6< /Gmap_id><time>1609727717010< /time><Rating>5</Rating>< pics>

Only minor issues have ever arisen and they dealt with them as promptly as they could. Both are always walking with a smile and a wave. At some point I will have to move on but, I’ll always have a soft spot here.<//Text>

<text>Recently moved in and have had a very good experience with all of the Avalon staff, Joseph Drewer was more than helpful every step of the way and has been available to answer any and all questions. From touring the area virtually and in person to getting my keys, it has been such a smooth process. Joseph has called to check-in with me in the first few days to see how it was all going which was very kind to do. The apartments are very nice and have a great floorpan, love the amazon hub package lockers and the multiple doggie clean up stations. Parking for guests is a little inconvenient due to passes not being available when wanted, as is only having 1 key per person living in the unit (I like having dog walkers being able to use a lock box at my door vs gaining a pass with their ID), but otherwise it has been a great community sod far.</text></record>

EDIT: I’ve now lived here for almost 2 months and I still think it is great! I have put in 2 maintenance requests during that time for small issues and the first one was fixed within a couple hours. I was contacted within probably 12 hours about the second request (I put it in overnight) and it was fixed the next day. Patrick and Ernesto on the maintenance team were professional, helpful, and friendly! In fact, all the staff I have interacted with have been highly responsive and super nice.

Also, there are a few reviews that mention the vista detention facility. Yes, this is virtually right next to the apartment complex. However, I walk my dog in the empty field right next to it (and even have at night) and I have never felt unsafe there or within the gated community.

ORIGINAL REVIEW: I haven’t actually moved in yet, so I will change my review as needed, but so far my experience has been wonderful. I am moving from Illinois to California, and with covid and my work schedule, I was not able to go and visit anywhere in person prior to signing a lease. Joseph gave me a FaceTime tour of the actual apartment I am leasing as well as the entire grounds of the apartment complex. The place looks really nice. Given the situation, I also had to lease the apartment almost a full month before I arrive in order to get the special rent price (it was still cheaper to pay for a month while not living there than to wait and pay more per month). Joseph helped make my “move in” date as late as possible while still getting the special rate so that the prorated rent was as low as possible. He answered all of my questions and even helped with getting a package that was delivered much earlier than expected. Overall great experience before even arriving in California!< /review>

Patrick is the person on site who takes care of any maintenance issues and responds quickly to any concerns.  He takes care of any issues and calls to personally advise that the "problem" is resolved.  They both get 5 stars!</review></record></dataset><record>

Moving can be really stressful, but Nick, Patrick and Dominique were so helpful and responsive, that is we forgot to be stressed!

I believe that customer experiences about how you handle things when they go "wrong", just as much as when they're going smoothly. There were a few minor repairs that needed to be made to our apartment upon move in, and they were made very quickly.

The quality of the unit, the special touches in the amenities and if course, the folks running this community make Avalon Vista a winner 🏆.< /Review>

It was so great working with the team at Avalon Vista on Saturday while serving Ice Cream to their residents!  They worked with us to practice safe social distancing by having people stationed 6' apart while in line, they encouraged everyone to wear facial coverings, and everything was organized and ran so smoothly!  Not only do they value their residents by thanking them for staying home and doing their part, they are supporting small local businesses like us here at Sweet Treats!  I couldn't be more impressed with the management team, specifically Dominique.  Thank you for having us be a part of your special event and hope to work with you again in the future!<//review>

<Review>Mina Alvarado is the maintenance tech from Avalon vista, she’s awesome. Always willing to help and assist you with anything around your apartment. I’ve lived here since 2017 and she has been a lot of help, always has a positive attitude and makes sure everything is fixed around our home.

Side note: Samuel Alvarado has been a lot of help, he’s willing to help us on our needs, always with a positive attitude.</Review>< Date>

Overall I have to say this place is amazing, maintenance is on top of things, anytime I’ve had a issue with noise for some reason (which is really rare) it gets handled relatively fast, and probably my most memorable moment is when I was sick and bed ridden with the flu for almost 7 days, Nick in the leasing office brought me some chips and crackers and some bubbly drinks to help me get better. Absolutely a pleasure living here.

I used to live at an apartment complex just around the corner from here, and it was a nightmare.< /Text>

<Review>Sad to leave!! Enjoyed our stay here. Our home was pleasant and we enjoyed entertaining here. The grounds are well kept, and the pool area and clubhouse were our favorites. Restaurants near by and Saturday farmers market will be sorely missed.
There seemed to be a good amount of turnover in the office staff, but everyone was pleasant. I can’t say enough about the maintenance crew. Talk about going above and beyond on more than one occasion. Brian in particular, was a constant since moving in. Always a fresh smile and willing to go the extra mile to assist. Thanks for the stay Avalon!< /Review>< pictures>

I have been living in this community for almost 3 years now and I am very pleased to have workers like Stan Stafford. He is one of the nicest person that i know. He always has a smile on his face always laughing no matter what type of job he has to do for the apartment complex. He also keeps everything professional. He has never turned down any maintenance request and keeps the area clean when he comes to fix it. For this reason I am giving Stan 5 stars for his professionalism and his positive attitude and work ethic. Thank you Stan and keep up the great work!< /text>

My Wife and I just moved to Avalon Vista 3 days ago and let me say, this should be the standard for all apartments, everything is up to date and the staff are amazing! We only had a small issue with the A/C,(I couldnt figure out how to work it) i called the front office and Nick told me that maintenance had left for the day already, but in less than 5 mins Nick was at my door to make sure everything was good with the A/C. Outstanding Avalon!</review>

We love the Avalon Vista! The staff is amazing and always so helpful. The apartments are spacious and each room is equally laid out so you don't feel cramped in any room. I really like that the bedrooms are spacious as well as the common area. The maintenance team is quick to fix any and all issues. The one negative thing is irresponsible dog owners who do not clean up after their dogs. I would like to see a better system implemented to better catch offenders. Other than that we are so happy!</review>

Wanted to shout out Dominique and Nick for going absolutely above and beyond for all their help recently. As someone who works in customer service, I really do appreciate what they do.

I absolutely LOVE living here. We took the chance and signed the lease before coming to visit, but my gut knew it was the right choice. The inside of our apartment is modern and cozy, the pool area is so pretty and I always feel safe. You rarely ever hear any outside noise or noise from your neighbors. The amenities here are awesome and I could honestly see myself living here long term.< /Review>< pictures>

< Review>
Whoa child...The “central” a/c and heating...let’s discuss...I’m currently renting a 2 bedroom apartment, the a/c only flows to one room 🙄 I was told that because the room furthest from the door is closer to the a/c unit it received a/c and heating but the other room doesn’t due to a flaw in the design. I lived in building 715, the one closest to the club house...During the weekend it’s ridiculously noisy. Also the building that I lived in had a lot of residence with large dogs, one dog in particular dog owner would allow his dog to urinate on the cement right by the entrance, so the entrance would continuously smell like dog piss. Because I work 12 hour staffs at the hospital I would Occasionally be home during the day, there was construction across the street and even with windows closed you can hear everything including the homeless lady that frequently would be screaming “ the world is mine”.
Pros:

The apartment units are bigger space wise then other apartments in the area.

You get a garage and a parking space

Great amenities

Some staff members are friendly not all

More cons:

The parking policy isn’t resident friendly ( the unassigned spaces)

If we would have renewed our lease our rent would increase $214.<//Review>

Love living in Avalon Vista. The location is close to marketplaces and the highway. I am able to walk to farmers market and nearby stores without driving. The community is always clean.

Awesome apartment complex and beautiful community. The gym here is one of the many awesome things that this place has to offer.  It is clean and everyone picks up after themselves. OPEN 24/7.
Great pool, great managers, and all around nice friendly people living here. Could not ask for a better place to call home in Sunny San Diego!

Stephanie is awesome and super great help! She calls with information about the community and is always very helpful with everything. If you are looking for a beautiful, well maintained, dog friendly, people friendly, BBQ friendly community, THIS IS IT!</Review>

Awesome place to live! Friendly staff, nice and clean community. I like the garage and the hardwood floor. I opted for this place even though my work place is 30 miles from here - it's that good. Don't mind the price, given the facilities, features... I would definitely recommend Avalon Vista.</review>

My husband and I have lived here since it was first built and love it.  Great amenities and high end trimmings.  I love that this place is home and like a family.  The maintenance and front house team do a great job.  Brian is nothing short of fantastic and takes care of every need right away. Mina always works super hard and is the first to say hi in the mornings.  We love having JR back and have noticed a huge improvement in how clean the place is since having him around  (we have lazy residence who don’t pick up after their dogs but it’s gotten way better).  Stan is so good at dealing with maintenance requests.
We love living here and that’s a huge thanks to the staff who make this feel like a home and not a temporary place to rent.</text>

<Review>The service that this community has provided is nothing short of outstanding. I've had zero issues while living in this community. The overall staff is excellent and you really get what you pay for.
Some notable features include:
1. An outstanding grilling area that gets cleaned daily
2. The pool area is luxurious, relaxing and spotless
3. The community as a whole is respectful
4. The staff -- from the leasing office to the maintenance crew is professional, friendly and accommodating.

Highly recommended 👍🏾</Review>< user>

I'm living at Avalon Vista for 4 months and loving it! My apartment is spacious and has a nice layout. Having my own washer and dryer is a true blessing. My neighbors are pleasant and quiet. My dog loves the dog park and looks for her friends every day to play with. I haven't been in the pool as yet, for me I like the air temperature to be warmer, it is salt water and looks amazing. What's not to love!< /Text>

We moved from Idaho to California recently and were somewhat dreading the move-in process. Stephanie Ruiz at Avalon Vista made our move EASY and made sure that we had everything we needed. It's not easy moving from out of state, but the team at Avalon was efficient and respectful of our time. Everything went smooth and we really appreciate that!< /review>

Been here for a couple years now and still very happy. Recently I had some issues with my in-unit washer. I sent a service request and within hours Patrick came over and located the problem and fixed it! This is the second time he has come to my rescue. Previous time was with my sink and he came over and promptly fixed that as well. He is fantastic!< /review>

They don't mention the prison within a 2 mile radius or the the monthly patrols cops have looking for a felon or another individual.

<review>My wife and I have been living at Avalon Vista for a while now and absolutely love it ! The complex is beautiful, it's clean, and even though it's pet friendly it's peaceful and quiet.

The rent is a little on the higher end for us but it is absolutely well worth it. The amenities like heated salt water pool and jacuzzi, 24 hour gym with free weights and machines are a real treat.

Also big shout out to Jordan and Eileen, I have read countless reviews about how great they are and I am glad to confirm its all true. They have been and continue to be super stars, making living here even better.<//review>< pictures>

<review>This is an upscale place that is about 3 yrs old.  Inside the apartment, it is great, very neutral, and comfortable.  Poolside is getting worn & dirty.  Management has changed.  The balance is off, there's more and more large sized dogs that are not friendly, actually aggressive with loud barking, snarling, growling, and jumping at you.  There's a dog lease rule that is not always enforced, finding dogs unsafe.  It was mostly professionals and families when I moved in, but it's turning into more and more college age, and military people, with loud parties, drunkenness at the hot tub & pool, and not being well behaved and considerate of others.  Hopefully new management will start addressing this.< /review></record></dataset><record>

<review>DO NOT MOVE HERE!!!
This place is their biggest rip off, prepare to be nickel and dimedo here on everything. They will find a way to continue to take money from you even after you've moved out. They do not honor their agreements, I referred a friend and they never processed my $250 referral. Also said that if I didn't opt into their Clean Sweep program I would be charged over $250 for complete repairs, so I opt into their ripoff of $189 for clean sweep and of course after I move out they charged me for their $250 repairs anyway. This place is terrible, better to live on their streets!< /review>< Rating>

<text>I would rate this place with zero stars if that option was allowed.

Our experience with the staff at Avalon Vista was extremely unsatisfactory.  There had been several missteps with the Avalon staff filling in our information onto the application.  We had provided them with our California driver's licenses so that they had the official information in front of them.  For whatever reason, they kept mixing up my information with my fiance's information such as switching our last names.

They ran a credit check against us, with the incorrect information, and our credit report shows this inquiry.  About a week had passed before this issue was noticed.  When we followed up with the Avalon staff that they had entered our information incorrectly, they vowed to fix the issue to continue our application process.  What they failed to mention was that this would require another credit check against us.  They DID NOT request our approval to run another credit check and our credit reports now show a second inquiry.  THIS IS ENTIRELY UNACCEPTABLE!

My fiance and I pride ourselves in keeping great credit scores and the incompetence of the Avalon staff will potentially cost us thousands of dollars in lost credit ratings.  I will actively discourage my friends and colleagues from applying to any Avalon communities.

My fiance and I were very happy that we had found our next home at Avalon Vista and were excited for our move-in date to arrive.  We were willing and eager to give them our hard-earned money every month but they made it extremely difficult to do so and soured our entire experience.

For the Avalon staff, please review your training and make it a point to emphasize to your applicants whenever a credit check will be required.  Do NOT run a credit check without first getting authorization from your applicants that it's ok to proceed.<//text>< pics>

<text>I lived at Avalon Vista from March 2017-February 2019 and had a fantastic experience. The only reason I left was to move closer to work. My fiancé really loved our apartment layout, particularly the large windows and the natural light that would come in all day.

I worked the most with Hillary, who was always wonderful at addressing questions/issues or even just for a fun conversation. The maintenance staff is also really great, any requests we ever had were addressed within a few hours, next day the latest.

The amenities were always well maintained. We often used the gym and pool and even had a small party in the bbq area for my birthday. Also, on Saturdays, there is a farmers market right next to the community. I really enjoyed walking over and sampling all the food from the awesome variety of vendors.

Overall, we (my fiancé and I) had a great experience living here and would highly recommend the community.<//text>< Rating>

Very clean and new. Nice little pool with a clubhouse and outdoor seating area with a TV.  Very social.  It's definitely geared toward younger adults though, not as welcoming if you've got a kid under 10ish. Also the walls and ceilings are super thin, so be prepared to hear everything going on in your building.  Arguments, babies crying, loud music, intense orgasms, stabbings, vacuuming...</Text>

<Review>I just moved into these apartments. Having experienced a range of living situations I am ecstatic about the wet Avalon vista has to offer. Large gym onsite as well as within walking distance to a 3rd party gym. Plenty of restaurants for take out also in walking distance. Having recently been in a more expensive apartment that required roommates to afford at another establishment it is nice to have the freedom to live as nicely as I am able to here at Avalon vista on one income. With quick access to Carlsbad, San Marcos, and all of Vista I am infinitely pleased with the location. Glad to have gotten this place.<//Review><pics>None<//pics><Response>{'time': 1466799652878, 'text': "We're so glad to hear that your move-in experience was a good one, Scooter!

<review>I've been with Avalon for quite some time, and since day one the staff have exceeded all of my expectations. The property is always clean and any request placed is completed and fixed within 24hrs. The Maintenece crew is inviting and amazing. Richard, and Chris are rock stars anytime I see those guys, they always take time away from their busy schedule to hear what I have to say, and that means alot, and says even more about the Avalon culture. I'm happy to be apart of this community, and wouldn't have it any other way< /review><Rating>5< /Rating>< pics>

I initially gave a 5 star rating when I first got here but am changing it to one star now due to the rudeness of the office staff and how the standards have fallen over time. Staircases are not cleaned regularly. Dog poop is not removed even after complaining. The staff have no common sense or logical reasoning when discussing any problem, for e.g., we reserved a parking spot on their website and placed the reservation confirmation information on the car dashboard. We got a warning the next day. When asked about this in the office, we were told that we only have to place a printed copy of reservation confirmation page and not the handwritten one. We told her the information on the page, whether it is printed or handwritten is the same and it makes no sense to determine whatever was handwritten as invalid. We would normally print this page if we plan in advance but the last time we had to take out the car all of a sudden and we did not have access to printer. What really got us irritated was the attitude of the staff (Hillary) and the illogical reasoning she used to defend themselves for giving us the warning. We will definitely move out at the end of our lease this year.< /Text>

I've been a resident for past 2 years with this community. The attitude of the staff here really sucks. They don't respond for the issues and are not at all supportive.

<Text>I don't want to just blast Avalon Vista and go on a rant about the one star rating, there are some things that could have been done better and there is an incident that occurred that rewards them with the overall rating. First I will state the team did work with me in finding an apartment that I was looking for while I was in Japan. Phone calls were made emails were sent and as I got closer to coming back to California the team kept me informed. I understood the property having lived here briefly prior to moving to Japan, and though the consultants had changed everything seemed to be good. My first issue on move in day came with one of the electronic keys not functioning. I mentioned this when I first discovered the issue and was told my information just needed to be put into the system. Two hours later the issue was still present and I was finally put into the system. As I was unpacking after the move in I found a torn up broom in the laundry area I was slightly disappointed because I knew the apartment had been walked through the morning of my arrival. As I unpacked my kitchen goods I wanted to wash a couple of things and noticed there wasn't a sink stopper, once again nothing major just an attention to detail item that I noted. As it became dark I noticed the area outside my door wasn't illuminated like all the other doors, once again I took note. I will say that every issue that I brought up to the staff was handled the following day. The biggest issue that I had came four days after move in on a Saturday afternoon, when an employee used a key and unlocked my apartment to show to a perspective resident. I was appalled that an employee could access an apartment that had been signed for and occupied. I have since spoken to the manager of the community about this incident and have been reassured that training will occur to prevent this from occurring again, but that doesn't excuse the fact that it occurred in the first place. I expected more from this property which is why I decided to come back to something I knew, I have been disappointed since moving in.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

<text>I absolutely love living here!  The staff is always so helpful, in anyway they can be.  From the office, Jordan, Eileen, and Hannah to the maintenance crew, of Brian, Richard, and Chris.  The residents are friendly.  The grounds are always kept clean, and well maintained.  The pool is beautiful, and I especially love, that it is salt water!

The apartments are new!  They are spacious, with high ceilings, and large windows.  They come with outlets, that allow for usb connection.  The kitchen has more than enough cupboard space, all within easy reach.   The bedrooms all have walk-in closets.  The bathrooms have double sinks.  The washer and dryer have their own hidden space.  The units come with heat and air-conditioning.  If you don't want to park in your garage, the parking area, is ample, and there is always a parking space available and close by, for you and your guests.  The area is quiet, and conveniently located, near 78.  Farmer's Market is every Saturday, and within walking distance.  Costco is just a little over a mile away, and the movie theaters are close by too.

If you have a dog, as I do, you don't have to run around looking for doggie bags.  The grounds, are overflowing with pet stations, for easy clean up.  We even have a self-service dog washing station :)

I am so glad I came to live here!

<username>Nicole Salas< /username><time>1492875177469</time><Rate>4< /Rate><text>I have been living here for just about 9 months and it is one of the best apartments I have lived in so far. All the people her are nice from the employees to the residents. I regularly see maintence outside cleaning up everything, espesialy Chris, he always has a smile on his face and always makes a point to say hello to you. He seems always happy to help anyone out also. This place Is somewhat dog friendly place, I do wish the dog park was larger, and that there was one on the other side of the complex, and it would be very helpful if they didn't pace so many large thorn plants everywhere with not many places for dogs to go to the bathroom. My dog has had so many cuts on his paws and infections from them. They are everywhere which is extremely  not dog friendly.. it lines all walkways. You can't always keep dogs off.</text>< Pictures>

Wendy, Eileen, and Stefany are all fantastic and provide outstanding customer service! The rest of the crew members are friendly and welcoming. Once in a while, they throw community events, usually with a ton of food and drinks. I love the modern style of the apartments, the club house, and the gym, which has a TRX, BOSU, Kettle bells on top of the usual gym equipment. The jacuzzi has a fire place and a TV right in front of it. So dope! The location is 2 minutes from the 78 and has a ton of restaurants, groceries, gas stations nearby. I have been for 6 months now and have renewed for another year. I highly recommend Avalon Vista!</Text>

Management has changed, not for the better. Even with security, someone broke into our garage. Cops are out handling domestic calls. Neighbors out yelling at 2am. Not worth it.</text>

<review>Good place to stop on the way home for whatever. Booze, beer, soda, smokes, candy bar lotto ticket, or eye drops etc. They got decent prices & they are nice people. This is one of the few places that won't give you an attitude if you bring in a bag of change. They do ask you to roll the pennies but will gladly accept money in coinage. (Don't expect the same courtesy from any of the gas stations on Main Street, even in a situation where you have run out of gas.) So if you need a few things on ur way home but don't want the long lines, this is where ya gotta go.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None</response><gmap_id>0x8090c5c895d95517:0x9bef71ccf025b6ac<//gmap_id></record>

2020.09-20/SUN_1000; ALREADY a line for this place so you KNOW it's good! We ordered so much! Two mulitas - one made with birria and the other asada. Four queso tacos - two birria and two asada. Then four tacos Dorado - two birria and two asada.

I want to touch base on the smell of the delicious food from this place. It's entirely different. It's life your grandmother's house. Just the aroma alone from walking out of the room and back in, will make you speechless.

The mulitas MELTED IN MY MOUTH. I've had a lot of mulitas from other places and you know, they're okay but not like this! I ADORE their tortillas here. You can taste the homemade goodness coming from these tortillas. SO FREAKING GOOD. I can't even say enough about the quality and deliciousness of their food. It was so good that we inhaled all of our food! The tacos Dorado had the best light and crispy tortilla and it was stuffed! The queso tacos were the same! All of it! Just goodness in your mouth!

You definitely have to try them yourself! We arrived at 9:45 and got in line at 10 and there was already a line! One word for this place: fire. Enough said.</text>

< Review>
Super disappointing.  We tried the mixed plate, 4 quesotaco and 4 soft tacos. Everything was greasy it ruined the taste and made everything but the goat tacos pretty much undesirable. All 4 of us were excited to try but sadly we all left after throwing everything in the trash, it was just that gross. Maybe Sunday is just not the day to go there. Service was quick considering how long the lines were.<//Review>

This is our second time and we drove about an hour from our home to there it's all worth it. We went after we saw Anthony Davis there and how good everything looks!
Great customer service and very humble workers. The lady that gives the orders she is amazing and I let her know how much I love her service!
Once at home we did some quesabirria tacos and some Mexican rice to go with our tacos and also our consomé! Best food ever! I almost forgot we made some fresh  guacamole! We had a feast!😋< /review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMAFE7ekC2TZyLW5TRGdhS9abeP6xXBHkqBnfgM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNl2vuYjWIPa0eSPs1NovSjPLeX91MIJodJ7hmf=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics><Response>None</Response>< gmapID>

It was good with handmade tortillas. Lacked some authenticity flavors. Our order wasn't complete. To find out when got home that they gave us our wrong meat choice, and did not include some food that was ordered. I don't like being taken for my money.<//review>

The worse food anyone can buy! Warning to the public, save your money and the stomach problems that me and my family experienced. We all ate the "goat" tacos because they were out of beef and steak. We all got sick with diarrhea for nearly a week. Super greasy! I don't understand how anyone would recommend this place. We only went to this place bc of the reviews. HUGE MISTAKE!!! They have an "A" rating in their window. WTH?< /Review>

Food was decent. The consome the birria was a bit over cooked. Drink was perfect not as sugary as other bottled beverages and it was not a powdered drink.</text>

My husband and I come here all the time and have never left disappointed. Our go to items are the goat/beef quesatacos along with the consommé. All the food here is extremely addicting. We find ourselves coming here at least three times a week because it’s just that good. On top of the delicious food, the customer service here is top notch. We’re always treated with so much respect by the owner and his friendly staff. Thank you so much for the incredible experience. Just know you got us as loyal customers for life!<//review>

Not as good as I thought it would be but everyone was so nice and helpful! I just don't like soggy tacos and without the dipping sauce it's very bland. The tostada on the other hand was very delicious tho mine was a little on the cool side it was still good.<//Review>

<Text>Plato mixto is my go to. I think the owner takes down the orders. Nice dude. My buddy got the wrong plate the other day, ended up giving him my mixto plate so he could try it. Other than that this place never let's me down. Good quality food, always tasty, good customer service. Keep up the good work.< /Text>< rating>

They have some amazing tacos! Been here a few times and they never disappoint, plus they are a small business and we all know how much of our support they could use during these hard times. I recommend the quesatacos with consome such a beautiful combo. I usually get three with a mexican drink to wash it down. My mouth is starting water. Lol< /review>

One of the best birria spots in the valley. A must try. Go with their mixed plate. You get pretty much every birria taco on the menu.<//text>

The birria de chivo is cooked right and does not have an after taste.  The consome is good and glad it wasn't salty. The chili oil and red sauce is bomb... has that smoky flavor.

(Translated by Google) Huy papa, I recommend accompanying your tacos or whatever you ask for with a rich and delicious consome, be it the quesatacos, soft tacos, personally those with the delicious tongue.
Everyone their tastes but well 100% recommended go and check it yourself.
I owe them the photo and what day they come to Los Angeles so that they are closer to me.

Huy papa les recomiendo acompañar sus tacos o lo que sea que pidan con rico y delicioso consome ya sean los quesatacos, tacos suaves, en lo personal los de lengua riquisimos.
Cada quien sus gustos pero bueno 100% recomendable vallan y compruebenlo ustedes mismos.
Les debo la foto y haber que dia vienen hasta los angele para que me queden mas cerquitas.<//Text>

Went in their today to buy dog food and was disappointed to see one of the guys not wearing his mask i didn't even want their help carrying my bags to my car you think they keep up on the state guide lines mask our required even June 15th the mask mandate is not lifted in the new opening guidelinesI find it rude its horrible how small business don't care and think covids over very crowded  ...and to think of the elderly that shop their you think they would have the respect to wear it inside .some one needs to report this if its not handled  ..our they just lost a good customer...come on follow the rules ...</text>

<rating>5< /rating><Text>Awesome prices on any lizard and snake feeders you could need. Workers are awesome, all of them are friendly and kind 😊 I've been to a lot of feed stores and this is by far the best one.
They have good prices on dog and cat food, and a MASSIVE selection of cat supplies.
They also have a cute little kitty running around.
Attached cricket prices. NEVER GOING TO PETSMART AGAIN.<//Text>< Pictures>

You can find assorted pet dog foods here for reasonable prices. They have more assortments and better prices than regular retail stores.<//Text>

Great place to get food for a large variety of pets. From horses, chickens, parrots, fish, turtles, etc. The staff is very friendly, and they also sell things to get rid of mice and rats as well as insects and bugs. They also have beds for dogs they have collars and leashes and a lot of other things go check them out.</Review>

Went their yesterday  to buy a chicken coop but did becasue when i went in i felt un comfortable they had like 4 customers in their with no mask and even a guy worker didn't have a mask on this is bad they have signs saying required but they dont care. That this is reality and covid is real i lost my sister to covid and why would a small business not care you think they would be differnt then a big box store but they are all the same i hope the owner read this and takes action before he loses any more customers to this the store is not big enough to stay 6 feet from people especially when they dont have mask  on last time i checked ur required to in retail stores to wear them and especially their workers they think they invisible please help our city and state to slow the spread ...if everyone just did their part<//review>

Meh place it focuses on birds and dogs more so good for the average pet owner but less selection of the other types.  Best to use Amazon or Petsmart<//Review>

<Text>We have been going here for about a year or more now. Very helpful staff and friendly too. This place has what ever you need, if not they can get it or you really don't need it. The owner is very knowledgeable and friendly at the same time. My dog has come down with allergies and this place has been more than helpful and willing to get me whatever I need for her. As far as I'm concerned, this is the best feed store in the Inland Empire.<//Text>< Name>

Very helpful staff. Wish they had more variety of cat food, but other than that they have a lot of things that most pet stores don't have. And they open earlier than any other pet store.</review>

Went there to get an E-collar for our newly adopted pupper (the vet didn't have one), they were nice enough to let me walk out the door with it to see if it would fit. From what I could see they were courteous and helpful everyone. Would definitely go again if I was in the area.<//Text><Pics>None</Pics><response>None<//response>< GmapID>

First time coming here and was warmly greeted today as I asked about the pet clinic. Got my number and looked around the store until it was time for my pet to line up and wait to be called for his turn.  Great service. I will be recommending this place to other pet owners</Text>

<Review>Best value and prices for my pets, and other corporate pet stores can’t compete. Here, I can get Primal raw bones and food, meat that my dog really needed.

Actual frozen goat’s milk, live birds, bird feed, small animal feed for hamsters and rabbits, frozen raw bones, premium dog treats, and dozens of quality cat and dog kibbles are all sold under one roof.  The team here helpfully brings large bags to customers’s vehicles.  They know how to take care of customers.< /Review>< pics>

All pet is a great store great staff ...they are great with enforcing the face mask their makes you feel comfortable shopping .but today i witnessed a employe getting yeld at by Another customer because he asked him to put a mask on hes a greatvworker and people need to be nice to workers and respect that they are their to help us  were only in their for a little then  we can take them off in are car . But please wear ypur mask in stores . Thats the right think to do and be nice  to workers when thwir just doing their job i felt bad for the guy  he was not wrong. Keep up the good work all pet you always helped me for years .</review>

<Text>Our local feed store, always go here to get our Guinea pigs and rabbits food. Good prices, could be a little cheaper but overall good quality and loved that they close late at 7:30 on week days. They do have a clearance selection if need to find things on sale. They have animals like rats, bunnies, rabbits and chickens but they don't sex them, not sure if they know how. Overall great place to go, staff is always very friendly and helpful when needed. They help you carry your stuff to your car sometimes.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><name>Clarissa Spruill<//name></record></dataset><record>

<review>I had such a wonderful experience today at this feed store. They have everything you could possibly need for your pet or animals care.  I went in with a friend to get dog food and noticed they had Hemp products and CBD oil.  I explained that my veterinarian had recently suggested the possibility of trying this for my dog and suggested I research more information in order to take her off of some harsh medications. They were so informative and helpful,  assuring me that this would be a great alternative for my dog. I was so pleased to leave with valuable information I needed to make my decision. I found their staff to be very knowledgeable and informative with the information I needed.  I will definitely be giving them my business.  Customer care is very important and although you don't see it much anymore this place really makes a difference. At least check it out I think you will be very satisfied.< /review>< pictures>

<Review>We have been buying dog food from them since we got our bulldog. My dog is now allergic to chicken and I was struggling finding a dog food for him. Every time I go in and ask questions they take the time to answer my questions and give recommendations. Well I was second guessing myself and bought a food that instantly had my dog scratching again. They took the food back (over half full and in original package) and exchanged it. The fact that they carry it out for me every time without me having to ask is a plus especially with my back.  Good friendly people.</Review><user>114846257187863125861</user><pics>None<//pics>< Rate>

The people here are very helpful and so I love giving them my business. They have quality pet food that actually have ingredients for healthy pets unlike your well known brands at chain stores too. So it's a win win! Thanks y'all</review>

<text>A great store with tons of different things. They're the only store I've found in town that carry the brand of mini pig feed my baby eats. Prices are super reasonable and the staff is always kind. I've never had to carry out my big bags of food myself, even when I've been determined to, a worked always takes them out for me. It's a great store for pet supplies of all kinds.<//text></record>

But is one of the best places for Victor brand and others . I also found a great bubba stick for walking... if in the aria this is your place.< /review><user>106618485018276701884<//user></record>

<review>This is a pretty straight forward feed store.  I enjoy it because I can typically get in and out relatively quickly and I can "earn a free bag" after purchasing 10 or twelve purchased bags.  Just be careful in the area, not really an ideal setting to hang out...<//review>< gmap_id>

Just stopped in to see what they had great selection of pretty much everything and what they don't have they can get. Henry run tight ship and have some really great employees keep up the good work. Highly recommend this retailer and go the extra mile for you check them out especially if you have horses small pets dogs I don't think it really matters like I said if you don't have it it get it.< /Text>

Very knowledgeable staff. Henry, the manager, is hands down one of the best people I know. They always carry my dog and cat food out to my truck for me. Great customer service!  Can't beat All Pet Feed and Tack. I drive from the high desert to get all of my supplies from them. 5 stars<//text>

I have been going there for years and the staff is helpful friendly and I never have to load all the 50 lb bags in my car. The prices are good.  The owner is the nicest guy. Also they will inform you on any pet or livestock subject if you have any questions. Great Place!<//Review>

<Text>Two words: OPEN SUNDAYS AND EVENINGS!! I can count on them to have what I need, when I need it, and on the one occasion that they didn't, the owner practically bent over backwards to get it asap. It would have been perfectly reasonable to simply tell me when the next shipment was due in, but instead, he immediately got on the phone with his supplier and arranged to drive out to pick it up early for me the very next day, and this has consistently been how they have dealt with me since day one!< /Text><pics>None</pics><Gmap_id>0x80c354b8cd5878c7:0xe4b719b7a011fa01</Gmap_id><name>Brittany< /name></record></dataset><record>

I've always had great service and prompt delivery from All Feed. What's interesting about the review with the maggots, we've had straw delivered for 4 years, and even after rain, we're still able to keep it outside our store (At The Cabin in Sky Forest) from end of August to after Thanksgiving. Rain and snow. They've always been very accommodating and I know Wildhaven Ranch uses them too.</Review>

I thought I would give this place a try to get my rice bran and 3-way for my horses.  Their prices were incredibly higher than the other feed and tack stores.  The 3-way grain produced maggots after one day in the grain container--GROSS!  And to top it off, they changed the numbers on my check!  I will never go back.< /Review>

<Review>Two words: OPEN SUNDAYS AND EVENINGS!! I can count on them to have what I need, when I need it, and on the one occasion that they didn't, the owner practically bent over backwards to get it asap. It would have been perfectly reasonable to simply tell me when the next shipment was due in, but instead, he immediately got on the phone with his supplier and arranged to drive out to pick it up early for me the very next day, and this has consistently been how they have dealt with me since day one!</Review><pics>None</pics></record></dataset><record>

<text>even with that silly/phunny BIG chicken outside,  they are my fav pet place t o shop.  They have ALL the shots that the fur babies need as well as the food that is reasonably priced.   They also have a vast supply of treats of all sizes that will make your doggie drool!  I even got a shalaylee stick for my ex there... no- although I should have beat him with it,  I did not.  All in all,  well worth the drive.< /text>< Pictures>

Bought my halloween bails of straw for$10 and they bought them back after I used them for $4 so it was a win win.   I ended up paying $6, which was the cheapest I found the straw for.  And they took them back,  I had no use for the straw other than decoration for halloween.  No problems with the sell back,  customer service was great.< /review>

Extra Friendly Staff. I have been going here over two years for my dog and cat food supplies (food, treats, shots, flee supplies etc). I have tried other feed stores and I have to say this one has employee's that have the knowledge and experience to assist you to make a knowledgeable decision. I have had one mild experience with an employee but that didn't keep me away.< /Review>

Went there before my baby died. I liked it . Not as supplied or as big as Petco but very pet family friendly and nice for pet parents to shop.</Review>

< review>
The owner is very nice and I sincerely hope that he fires the man that works there with dark brown short hair and facial hair. He is a big reflection of the shops location. They sold me a defective needle to vaccinate my puppy that broke on me when I knew I should have used my own needle. If the owner was there he would have helped and cleared the situation up. This "off the streets of sanbernardino" employee could not even give me a discount when their merchandise was defective nor call the owner. He tried to tell me that I must of done it wrong when I am a registered nurse. I truly believe in shopping at small businesses and supporting local communities but it makes it hard to do when a shops employees laugh at a customers issues with products and disrepect the loyal customers that generate their paychecks. Very great owner. But opt out of buying the syringe and go to a MEDICAL shop to do so.<//review>

While opening the bag of crickets I noticed a huge weird looking spider that frightened me, so now I'm a little iffy about going back. smh<//review>
