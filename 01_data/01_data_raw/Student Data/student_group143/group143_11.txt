The pizza was good and you don't have to wait long for it. I like the thin crust and this was perfect. Could have had a little more topping but still very good.< /review>

<text>Calls keep going to call center, when you think you're calling the location. They charge you the full price when you could get 10$ off, so be careful of that. So my order was wrong tonight. My order name was March instead of Mark. And they heard"thin"crust instead of "pan"crust.    Usually decent though. So I gave a better rating.</text>< resp>

<review>Hey, Google. How did this end up attached to Pizza Hut in Apple Valley? Instead of the Fast Stop Market convenience store in Victorville, where I was actually at? I can't remember ever being at Pizza Hut in Apple Valley.

Like it? I don't like or dislike it. However, they only accept cash for paying your electric bill. Which means I had to make a trip to the bank. You also have to pay a MoneyGram fee for the privilege of paying your bill there.</review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

I've been ordering from here quite often for the last 2 and a half years now.
The pizza, wings, and pasta, always seem to get better every time I order.
The staff is always very nice and polite. The food is always nice and hot, etc.
The only "issue" is that they're sometimes a little slow getting here sometimes.
But they're usually busy when we call.</review>

<review>I got injured from work and been at st mary hospital for over a week so i had to order so food from the outside world and ordered pizza. I talked to a young lady on the phone last night and told her im in a hospital and the driver would have to go threw a maze to find me and she said no problem, her and the driver had great attitude and both told me to get well. The pizza arrived 30 mins later nice and hot and it hit the spot. Im very happy with their customer service and their caring for others.</review><Date>1564862226750</Date><username>Abe Rafik</username>< Rate>

When I called in my order, at first I was bummed they didn't have any more large "Pan" or "Deep Dish" pizzas available. But the manager John, who took my call, told me he would make us 2 medium supreme "Pan" pizzas, but only charge us  for 1 large supreme "Pan" pizza. Because this manager, knows customer service, (which quite frankly is next to impossible to receive anymore THESE days!!!) I will ALWAYS use this Pizza Hut in Apple Valley  off HWY18 and will recommend this store to anyone who may ask me. Thanks Again! John you really met our needs. Thank you!< /review>

This location, is the worst. On three different occasions and multiple chances given,  they have failed at making a simple pizza! We will no longer order from Pizza Hut. Reached out to customer service and have never gotten a response.< /text>

Always friendly and food always hot and as I ordered, plus there Cinnabon desert is sooo flippin good!
Love the service they always go above & beyond to make sure we are happy!! Shout out to Nicole for exceptional customer service on May 29th 2019,delivery forgot Cinnabons & she not only made it right but did so while making the experience a pleasant one. Her kindness & bright personality shined through the phone & brighten mine & my sons entire night not to mention we still talk about it when refering others to Pizza Hut here in Apple Valley. Thanx Pizza Hut staff in Apple Valley!! ❤🍕😁< /Text>

The Pizza is good, when they make it right, but the customer service is usually lacking. Some of their workers are lazy and rude. They very rarely stand behind their products unless you get a manager involved and complain over and over.</text>

My large pizza was $28.00 dollars...Upon delivery and opening and eating the first peice we realized this was the worst pizza we ever have bought. Undercooked...hardly no sauce at all...not enough cheese and more...it was like eating a peice of bread with a little bit of topping on it. Don't waist your money at this pizza hut buy a frozen pizza...way cheaper and much better. We threw our pizza hut pizza away.< /Text>

These people are ANGELS. They have made a loyal customer for life and I will tell all of my family and friends. I have no idea when my tire popped,  but I noticed it at Starbucks. I drove over on my flat and called and explained. With absolutely no appointment they began working on my car immediately. They let me and my dog hang out in the car while they replaced my two rear tires. The price was EXTREMELY reasonable and I am very grateful. I cannot recommend enough!< /review>

<Rate>1< /Rate><Review>Terrible customer service. Brought vehicle in with nail in side wall was offered a new tire. So in good faith I bought 2 so they would be even . They mounted the new tires and didn’t replace the one that had the nail. They then put a used tire on the damaged tire and was bot the right size. When I left my traction control light came on and I realized that none of the tires were the right size I came back and waited another hour while they replaced 3 tires again. After a total of 3 hours the vehicle violently shakes because the tires weren’t balanced properly. I don’t know who they pay to do the reviews for this place but the owner is terrible at his job and has little to no automotive knowledge. Please do not take your vehicle here<//Review>< Pictures>

I have been buying Tires from Adam the owner of the Rolling Tires & Wheels for many years .
He provides  a greate customer service to all his customers and more importantly he is complaisant and he always  goes the extra miles to please his customers with smile and low prices, and he always will beat any competitors' Tire  Sales Prices out there.
He is awesome. 😊</text>

Had a flat tire and called the manager,  Adam. He ordered a new tire and replaced it quickly. He is very courteous and knowledgeable.  I would recommend this location.<//Text>

(My opinion!) The best customer service, hands down! Everyone here is so friendly and attentive! As a woman, I was never taken advantage of...  I came here twice, to remove a nail in my tire, and to fix a headlight that burnt out... (Range Rover dealership was closed) I wasn't overcharged and they didn't try to upsell me... if you're looking for honest and great service, this would be your spot!<//review>

I recently had 4 Tires Mounted and Balanced on Alloy Wheels and these guys charged me $100 which I thought was very high.  Work was good and I was in and out in about 30 minutes but this price seemed about 1-1/2 times what I was charged about 6 months ago so I'm assuming they either changed owners or they've had a large price increase for their work</review>

<Review>Very good attention to detail. I had 4 tires mounted and balanced in less than 20 minutes. Cost was not an issue. Workers were well trained.< /Review>< pictures>

Awesome place. Awesome price. Honest people, they said they could repair my bent rim if I ready wanted it fixed but recommended I didn't do it. Love the honesty.

Unmounted a tire and remounted it on another rim  in under record time. Especially for being a Saturday at 4pm!  Will be coming back for all my tire needs< /text>

The service was completed in the promised time and they even took my car for a test run to make sure everything was installed properly. I highly recommend coming here if you are having any brake or tie issues.</Text>< Date>

<Review>They over charge!!! $10 to swap a tire that was already off the rim to another rim? Never again, live and learn. I knew I should have went to the same place I’ve always went to in Wilmington. But I guess it is what it is<//Review>< pics>

<Review>You should be able to give 0 stars...So I came here last month with a flat tire.  Was told that my rims were bent and it was dangerous to drive on them, so they didn't advise putting a new tire over it.  Sounds legitimate.  I asked the worker if they carried rims in the store for purchase, he said no.  Then he said he had a set of used rims and tires in good condition that he could sale me for $330.  Reluctant but didn't sound like a bad deal, they looked alright.  Two days later I was driving on the road and the tire went flat.  Took it to the another nearby tire shop and he says the rim is bent but would be able to repair the tire, WOW.  4 weeks later another tire completely blew out on the freeway.  Returned here to address my dislike for the set of tires and rims that they sold me and to hopefully obtain some type of credit in good faith for there faulty sale.  Didn't happen, the cost for a set of 4 USED rims and new tires would be $420.00, after they initially told me they don't sale stock rims.  Then proceeded to tell me that I could sell the damaged rims that he sold me to recoup the cost, SMH.  At that point I felt like I was being bamboozled and decided I didn't want to do any further business.  He then told me he was going to charge me $30 for removing the spare, which could have been alleviated if he would have allowed me to address my concerns before running to other customers and having someone replace the tire.  BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!< /Review>< pics>

I was actually on the way to a different tire place when I spotted rolling tires to my right on  Western Av.. I decided to do a quick stop and to request a quote. What the gentleman quoted was a much better deal than the other places I had called, yet they  provided me with great service and high quality brakes. The place is family owned and I had the honor to meet the owner who is super cordial and obviously of high integrity. Try them, do not miss out.< /text><Rate>5<//Rate><Pics>None<//Pics><gmap_id>0x80dd4a73a7eb4d7d:0xaeed2dd7248a13b1</gmap_id><resp>None< /resp></record></dataset><record>

<review>The ultimate bait and switch at Rolling Tires Harbor City.  Had a Blowout so brought the wheel to be replaced they sold me a 185/60/15 for $66 find out they gave me the wrong size should've been 195/60/15  Now I've returned the car for the right size and he offered me 3 more for $40 each but charged me for 4 new 195/60/15. I complained and he took all the new tires off and put the old tires back on with one new exchanged correct size 195/60/15.  I know the customer is always right and should leave happy however he made his employees do double the work putting old tires on (without balancing them). In the end when I asked for a refund he charged my card again! Now I'm out $348 because they put the wrong size tire on!! All over a $30 deal as I gave him $10 cash too!!!</review><Rate>1<//Rate><userid>113291697869442520766</userid></record></dataset><record>

<text>My friend came in to get his tire replaced. While fixing his original tire, the worker managed to rip a chunk out of another one of his tires and scratched up his rims a bunch. My friend confronted the worker, and the worker did absolutely nothing to fix what he had messed up. This is 100% not okay. Don’t go here unless you want your car more damaged than it was when you brought it in.<//text>< pictures>

Very helpful quick service and they are open 7 days a week! Andrew explained everything over the phone to me so I'd make a good decision about my purchase and answered all my questions. They are still remodeling so no alignment available and although the price was fair it wasn't cheap, so 4 stars.</Review>

They took my truck to change the brakes and rotors. The man I left my truck with give me the impression that it would be done in about 1.5-2 hours. After 3 hours went by I called the establishment. Their phone was disconnected. I walked down to the shop (I live on the same block) and they are closed up and locked for the night! Why would they not call me and say hey we didn’t get to finish or can we hold the truck overnight! The guy took my phone number down and said he would give me a call. Now here I am no truck, don’t even know if they ever started working on my vehicle, and I have no way to work in the early morning. If I had a spare set of keys I’d just pick my truck up because it’s parked on the street in front of their shop. I’m so mad that they didn’t call and at least give me an option to be without my vehicle over night.</review>

SO I came in with a flat tire that needed a plug. I had already put the spare on the van. They said the tire was no good anymore. I disagreed, but they kept taking it off the rim and putting on a a new used tire for $30. I kept saying, "NO !" but they wouldn't stop. They took advantage of me being tired from changing the tire and susceptible to their high pressure. And they knew I had a credit card, as everybody does these days. I relented thinking I could be sure of a decent tire for at least half a year. But only a few months later the sidewall on this tire cracked !!!! They sold me a dated tire, that you couldn't tell by looking was going to go bad. I didn't know about checking the date on the tire (now I do). Shame on them !< /Text>

Tire blew on Saturday.  Scrambled to find anyone open nearby.  Should have called first.  An older fellow came up and asked what I needed.  I gave him the tire size and he claims to only have a brand new tire, no used.  When I asked if he could check, he popped into his office and right back out with the same - no used, only new at $75 total.  He then said that he had a different sized used tire but it would work the same.  I used to work for Sams Club tire center and knew that one whom works with tires should NEVER suggest that you run one different size than the other 3!!!  Safety issue RED FLAG.  So I took the new tire, since it was closer to closing time and didn't wanna drive more in that condition.  I needed to get my check cashed and he quickly saw an opportunity to snag my money so he helped himself to my rim in the trunk and offered to put it on when I was gone and it would be done quicker.  I got back and waited about 15min for my tire to be put back on by a different guy.  When I got home, I figured out why it took so long!  THE YOUNGER MAN WHOM PUT IT BACK ON LOST ONE OF MY ORIGINAL LUG NUTS AND MY CENTER CAP!!!!!  Couldn't even be a man and own up to a mistake like that, such a lack of business sense..  (My fault for not checking before I left, but)  NEVER GOING BACK HERE AND WILL TELL EVERYONE I KNOW TO STAY AWAY.<//Text>

Been coming here for years. These guys are so honest. Everyone from Palos Verdes, Rolling Hills Estates bring they're expensive rides here for a quick tire.
Excellent mechanics as well. Quality work.
Always coming back.
They do get slammed so be patient.<//review>

I recommend this shop, not only for the price, but attention to detail. I used to go to the one in San Pedro but wasn't too happy with them so I shifted to the one in Harbor City and am very happy I did.<//Text>

If I can rate minus 10 stars I would! My 74-year-old mother took her car for a wheel alignment came out with $400 replacement of struts. OK whatever. Probable that the car needed. But they broke the cruise control on the steering column. Owners son didn't have the decency to to look me to my face and tell me they weren't going to fix it. Sad because I grew up knowing his fathers entire family and they do this to my elderly mother.<//Review>

Jose head chef of this true hidden gem of a taqueria offers some of the best pupusas in SF. Delicately flavored w tasty fillings. These corn filled delights will dazzel ur tastebuds and keep u coming back for more. By far some of the best pupusas SF has to offer. So cheap and tasty a true SF treat that will fill ur savory tastes of authentic latino cuisine.
Great breakfast too. Delicious machaca and other savory egg dishes cooked from scratch a delightful hangover spot for sunday brunch or breakfast. Jose's attention to quality food and assurance makes for phenomenal mexican cuisine.
The countertop service adds to the old school setting of dining alone or w a friend but there is plenty of room in the restaurant for large parties or a family night out.
Experience this spot. No matter what u get. Most all of the time its going to be delicious!!!</text>

< Review>
The food we ordered wasn’t bad; it just wasn’t great. The quesadilla is big, cheesy, and meaty, and if you go with carne/beef it tastes similar to a Philly cheese steak sandwich minus the bun. The chicken tacos are somewhat plain; the meat seemed quality. Service was friendly. We wanted to try the pupusas but the wait was 40 minutes; it took 15 minutes for two chicken tacos and a quesadilla.</Review>

(Translated by Google) The food is good but the serving is rude, she may want to be anywhere but there, the schedule on the door said they closed at 8:00 pm, arrived at 7:25 and told us "and only there to go "with bad attitude and not even turn back to humble see, sorry for Mr. cooking, Yes He is friendly and the place should remain standing just for him, not for the harpy it serves, it was cheap tho

La comida está Buena, pero la que atiende es grosera, ella puede que quiera estar en cualquier lugar menos ahí, El horario en la puerta decía que cerraban a Las 8:00 pm, llegamos a Las 7:25 y nos dijo "ya solo hay para llevar" con mala actitud y sin siquiera voltearnos a ver, lástima por El señor que cocina, Él Sí es amable y El lugar debe Seguir en pie solo por Él, no por la arpía que atiende, it was cheap tho< /Review>

<text>(Translated by Google) I just want to say that I went to eat there with my mother and as always they served some chips, but when we discovered inside the chips there were about five Chis that were full of food as if they were from a previous customer so we stopped eating the sparks. Our order arrived were pupusas that were not finished cooking, but that way we ate them, they are not so bad, when we finished eating we put everything together and I put tanning inside my sauce so that they did not reuse it as they do with the chips and the waitress saw me and very angry I shout at me why I dirty the sauce, a lot that I answer, let me show you, I have greeted you these chips that obviously are the ones left by another client so that they do not use this sauce I have put tanning inside , people arrive with a dirty mouth grab the chips they bite and put it inside and saliva is inside the sauce, the waitress said yes and angry she told me, I will deny the service here, which I do not care, I want to vomit just thinking that they reuse the food that another client leaves. I will upload a photo of the waitress. And I don't go to that disgusting place again and as I said I will mandate inspection

Music is loud they always give wrong orders

I just wanted to say that I just went to eat at Cafe durango with my mother and as always they served some chips, but when we discovered inside the chips there were five Chis that were full of food as if they were from a previous client, so we stopped eating the chips. Our order arrived, pupusas, they were not finished cooking, but we ate them anyway, they are not so bad, when we finished eating we put all our waste together but, I also put little of food inside the tomato sauce for the chips so the waiterss not reuse my food to give an other client like they did with me, but the waitress saw me and very angry she screamed at me ... why are you messed up the sauce ???? So I answered polity,, let me show you, I've found five chips that obviously are from a client before me, I mean, people comes with a dirty mouth grabs the chips bite and then they put the chip inside the sauce with saliva , that is gros the, the waitress affirmed saying but you don't have to do this, I am not giving you service again. I feel like vomiting by thinking I was eating someone's wasted food. Of course I am not coming back to that place I'm going to upload a picture of the waitress. And like I said I WILL call inspection to close that dirty restaurant.

Solo quiero decir que fui al comer ahí con mi madre y como siempre sirvieron unas chips, pero cuando descubrimos dentro de las chips habían como cinco Chis que estaban llenas de comida como si fuesen de algún cliente previo así que dejamos de comer las chisp. Nuestra orden llegó eran unas pupusas que no estaban terminadas de cocer, pero así las comimos, no son tan malas, al terminar de comer pusimos todo junto y yo puse curtido dentro de mi salsa para que no la reusaran como lo hacen con los chips y la mesera me vio y muy enojada me grito por qué ensucia la salsa, a lot que yo conteste, déjeme le enseño, me ha saludo estás chips que obviamente son las que dejo otro cliente  así que para que no usen está salsa he puesto curtido dentro, la gente llega con la boca sucia agarra el chips muerden y lo meten dentro y saliva queda dentro de la salsa, la mesera afirmó diciendo si y enojada me dijo , le voy a negar el servicio aquí , lo cual a mi me da igual, tengo ganas de vomitar al solo pensar que reusan los alimentos que otro cliente deja.  Voy a subir una foto de  la mesera.  Y no vuelvo a ir a ese lugar tan asqueroso y como le dije voy a mandate a inspection

<text>(Translated by Google) This Café Durango, for me does not deserve a star.
In that place the chips recycle the sauce and the tanning that the clients leave and I say it because now I went to eat and when we were eating the chips they had sauce they had only put some on top of the basket they give with chips and put it in the next customer, and when we finish eating I usually always put the dishes on top of each other and stir the sauce with the tanning that we had left
And the fat waitress came and told me that because she had done that they used that and that it had been forbidden to do it and that they were not going to give me cervix the next time she arrived but all this she told me screaming, you old bastard,
She didn't have to yell at me, first because I wasn't doing anything, nor was she talking, second is a business and I pay for what I eat, and third because she lives on a salary and who gives her a salary? Let me be ... because I was the client at that time.
But do not even bother to say that you will no longer attend to me because, for me, there will be no next time that I want to go to that filthy place. Durango.
I say if they don't like working there, that they look for another job that they like, but that they don't get to work bitterly, that's why they treat the client badly.
And if you do not believe read all the comments, everyone talks about the bad attention they give there.

(Original)
Este Café Durango, para mí no merece ni una estrella.
En ese lugar reciclan  los chips la salsa y el curtido que dejan los clientes y lo digo porque ahora fui a comer y ya cuando nos estábamos comiendo los chips tenían salsa solo les habían puesto algunos encima a la cestita que dan con chips y la ponen en el siguiente cliente,  y cuando terminamos de comer por lo general yo siempre pongo los platos uno encima del otro y se revolvio la salsa con el curtido que nos sobró
Y llego la mesera gorda y me dijo que porque había hecho eso que ellas utilizaban eso y que hera prohibido hacerlo y que ya no me iban a dar cervicio la próxima ves que llegara pero todo esto me lo dijo gritando, vieja malencarada,
Ella no tenía porque gritarme , primero porque yo no estaba haciendo nada,  ni hablando estaba, segundo es un negocio y yo pago por lo que como, y tercero porque ella vive de un sueldo y quién le da un sueldo?..los clientes o sea yo ... porque yo hera el cliente en ese momento.
Pero que ni se moleste en decir que ya no me ba atender porque .para mí no habrá próxima ves que desee ir a ese asqueroso lugar.ni la comida y mucho menos la atención de las meseras dan ganas de volver a comer en ese asqueroso Café Durango.
Yo digo si no les gusta trabajar allí ,que busquen otro trabajo que les guste , pero que no lleguen amargadas a trabajar por eso es que tratan mal al cliente.
Y si no creen lean todos los comentarios , todos hablan de la mala atención que allí dan.<//text>< user_name>

<text>(Translated by Google) The excellent food. The only bad thing was the service we received. The lady who attended us. As it was not good. I would think about it 2 times to eat at the restaurant again. They need to improve customer service.

(Original)
La comida exelente. Lo unico malo fue el sevicio que recivimos. La seniora que nos atendio. Como que no andaba de buenas. Me la pensaria 2 veses para  volver  a comer en el restaurante. Nesesitan mejorar el servicio al cliente.< /text><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< GmapID>

< review>
My truck was loaded unloaded literaly 7 times because all the time he was overweight. i spent 2 days at this shipper and apprerantly they doesn't know how to load a trailer. Don't waste time going to this place and i hope that the shipping department will be changed because people are hired to a load trailer and they can not do their job... This is crazy and unproffesional from the managment side.<//review>

I arrived at 11:30p for a  11:59 scheduled pick up.  I was told that I could take the trailer, but the paperwork was not printed and would not be until 0300 or 0400. I asked if I could hook up to the trailer and wait at the dock for the paperwork. That was approved by the entrance guard. At 0300, I was told 0500. At 0500, I was told that the guy was booting the system and will bring the paperwork to the truck. At 0600, the yard jockey offers to pull the trailer out and take it to the gate because he needed that door and they were still trying to locate the paperwork. Finally, at 0628, a lady comes to the truck and says sign here and here. While the guard at the exit gate was extremely nice and empathetic, the lack of organization and effective communication made this a poor experience.< /text>

<review>Horrible place. Over 9 hours to get loaded. They don't believe in first come first served. A dozen trucks to load going to same place, same product. Had us all staged in line. We were first in and last out. They start with the back of the line so guard doesn't have to walk to the front of the line. Had a 2:00 appointment.  Apparently appointments don't matter.</review><pics>None</pics><response>None<//response>< GmapID>

Poor administration and management,,,looking forward to leave this company soon.Poor dispatch takes average 30-40 min to get dispatch.OWNER OPERATORS STAY AWAY FROM DAMCO/HUDD TRANSPORTATION you will save stress.payroll is horrible to many errors and take for ever to pay you.so many employee and seems theres no progress being done..<//Review>

< Review>
We brought in our 1986 Toyota RV for a smog and emissions test. The RV failed twice but Lathrop Smog did not fail us. They were quick and efficient with testing and helped us to diagnose what issues we were encountering. Once we fixed the issues, we were able to get in at short notice and passed the test with flying colors. They went above and beyond to help us and we are grateful for their generosity. We would highly recommend them in you are in the area.<//Review>

These guys took forever to get to me. I told them I needed to be in and out otherwise I'll take my business elsewhere. They sent me on a trip to store to get a part which they said was cheap, it was expensive af. Untrustworthy from the start talking about a part almost $200 is cheap. These guys held me up all day and now I have to stay in state for another day to go-to the dmv since they sold me bs word that this would be quick. F these guys take your business elsewhere if u need a job done in a matter of time</text>

<Review>You know when the old owner ran this place by himself I felt I was actually appreciate as a customer but now that they have new staff I would not recommend this place to anyone at all period.

This place is great. I’ve been here twice for smog checks and both times they’ve gotten me in and out very quickly. They even stayed open a little longer than they planned on today after I called and asked. I’ll be coming here for all future smog checks.<//Text>

Great place in terms of selection and price. But the older guy ( either manager or owner) is very very creepy to women in his store. He is always trying to touch or flirt with my girl. PREDATOR BEHAVIOR. BE CAREFUL</review>

The guys that work here are great, they're knowledgeable, and they have the BEST selection of Kratom. I asked them if they carried Charlotte's web CBD oil and they said no. I few weeks later they had it in stock. Don't go anywhere else if you can help it.Highly recommend them😍😘<//review>

Although busy all the staff take the time to listen, advise and provide an excellent service. The pipes on display represent only a tip of the iceberg of the outstanding stock they have so if you don't see what you want, ask and you'll be pleasantly surprised, never walked away without being a happy chappy. Keep it up Smoke Shop "Smoke Experts".<//Review>

The best part is that the prices can't be beat! It's entertaining just to stop in and look around ...you'll probably lose track of time🤗 I'll definitely do some holiday shopping there.<//review>< pictures>

Customer service is non existent here. Waited an hour when was specifically told it would be 30-40 mins to start on my vehicle. Wouldn't mind waiting but it took an hour. When asking how much longer it would be, front desk clerk gave attitude as if it's my fault she told me an incorrect time. Did not appreciate the attitude when asking a simple question. The older gentleman doing the actual work was apologetic and worked on not taking forever. He is appreciated. The lady should do better in responding to people when she is the one giving out information that I went off of. Would go back if I only dealt with the man.<//review>

Very helpful and friendly staff. Mechanics keep a clean shop and pay attention to the detail of their work, which a lot of shops lack. Great price on a set of tires and worked within my needs and budget. Will use them again.<//Text>

I was traveling through Cali back to Washington and blew a tire and destroyed a rim on my trailer. They didn’t have the special sized wheel/tire combo I run but they put in a few calls and were able to source exactly what I needed. New tires and wheel arrived within 30 min and I was out the door shortly after that. Very professional and friendly, felt they went above and beyond getting me back on the road considering I just dropped in.
Was also nice seeing that they actually use a torque wrench!
Thanks!< /text>< pics>

<Review>Great store , wide variety of products , clean well stocked , friendly/knowledgeable staff ready and willing to help you select what you need , then carry and help load your purchase ... AND a great restaurant to boot . Oh yes , the prices are not only competitive , but they beat most of their competitors most of the time ... plus plenty of parking that's easily accessible .< /Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

< Review>
Had to make two trips to get all the OSB board I needed for my roof today. They sold me two different types! My wife said how come the first batch had blue edges and the second batch had green.  The yard employee couldn't answer that and drove off on his forklift.  I learned to ALWAYS check  what you're getting and not just let them throw it on your truck. Wasn't worth the hassle to drive home and return with the other OSB. I can make it work< /Review>

Huge selection, incredible service. Matt is the most helpful person I have ever met. The store is huge! They have all kinds of things from building supplies to clothes and even a restaurant! The clothes selection is surprisingly impressive. This is the exact kind of does-it-all store that the town needs. Overall, this is an excellent business that deserves your patronage. The only downside is that the prices on specialty items can be somewhat costly, however, that is the price of convenience!<//text>

Kelseyville lumber is hit or miss with the service. At the contractors desk there some employees who seem to play favorites when the place gets  busy leaving folks who may not have lived here forever to feel like the new kid in fourth grade. The guy that finally ,"helped ," me with my plumbing questions was no help at all. In fact he seemed annoyed to even have to have a dismissive interaction with me and assured me that he didn't know whom I should ask period . Not later in the afternoon or possibly another day and most certainly not at present and ,,,," Could you please let the next customer in line have his chance sir?!!"
To be fair there were more days when the service was very good . The staff was knowledgeable,  friendly and informative . But if you get the wrong people your out of luck.
Very expensive as well. Quality merchandise abounds but, for such an economically challenged area it would seem like they might want to cary some more moderately priced lines of tools instead of just high end goods. I have not memorized the inventory so perhaps my perception was just off. It sure seems like Mendo Mill is less pricey though.
I will say I really enjoy woodys dilooner. Great food!<//text>

This only touched on the wide variety of items this store carries. Also full lumber yard on site, hence the name. There is even a full service restaurant on site.
The store, while well stocked and staffed by friendly and knowledgeable people, can be pricey.< /Review>< pictures>

I absolutely  love Kelseyville Lumber. All the employees are fabulous and super attentive. I havent seen a disgruntled  employee there yet. Everyone I've encountered is polite and very helpful. Several have gone above and beyond to help me find items I need for my projects. Their prices are very competitive to Home Depot. And what could be better?! They have an incredible cafe there as well!!!< /review>

<text>Wrong day to ask me about my experience at Kelseyville Lumber. Well actually it's not much different than almost every other time I try to buy something there. The unfortunate thing is they are so close and convenient, but it's just not worth how mad or upset I am by the time I leave. The incompetence of many of the employees, and the lack of desire to help is incredible. Common items not priced and check out personnel that can't find the price. Both caused by poor inventory control. No common
sense used by checkers. I 'tried' to buy an item that had an actual tag on it, and it was marked $1.10. The girl said the total was $1.53. I questioned it and she stated, "The register says $1.53". I replied that even with tax it couldn't be that price. She stated again,  "The register says $1.53. I walked out. This is only one small example of poor service by one of their employees. Don't get me started on how most of them avoid asking if you need any help or have any questions. I won't even go into why I walked out empty handed today. But it has to do with standing in a line of only 3 people for 15 minutes while the clerk tried to do a 50 cent return. I had $50 worth of plants in my cart. They're still there. I walked out.
I have been a patron of Kelseyville Lumber for over 20 years. It was not always like this. I simply don't understand.< /text>< user>

<review>Why is it that Kelseyville Lumber is the only business I have encountered around the lake, who makes you wait(who knows how long), to get a refund on an item we were charged double for? This is not a return but their mistake, because they rang up an item twice and I only got one. We were told they had to review their surveillance tapes first. Whaat? A really poor way to do business!

The quality of wood or products not an issue. However nice staff may be to my face they do not seem on the ball about delivery and how they treat the women customers seems more good ole boy stuff.

I don't have an issue with their products. It's the front checkout folks I have issue with. Waited in a long line and listened to the checker greet everyone and be pleasant, even a child in front of me. When it was my turn the checker just looked at me and asked if that's all I was purchasing. I'm not asking her to chat with me like everyone else in the line but at least give me the courtesy of asking me how I'm doing. I'm a loyal customer to businesses that treat me right. Looks like I'm going to mendo mill for now on.</review>

It's a nice store with lots of selection. While sometimes on the higher side in price they are not nearly as expensive at Mendo Mill (aka Bend over Mill). I find they are best for door and window selection and they do a fantastic job. Turnaround on special order items is reasonable and delivery fee is only $15 and usually can be delivered the next day.< /review>

<Text>I walked into Kelseyville Lumber today and went straight back to the window and door department to get another order of screen channels.

Bruce sat in his chair behind a computer as I asked about getting more material from him cause he sold it to me last time. He said he was busy being on the computer and had no time for me to help me.

Well he then got very rude and snaughty with me and in front of two woman who where shopping so bad that I told him this is how you treat your clients? The two woman over heard wanted my cards and I told them I have them up on the community board. They where shocked in his attitude.

I went to the front counter and asked for the manager in charge. She asked what was it about and I said the Bruce your guy back there in the window department is very rude and this is not the first time this has happened to me. Cashier rolled her eyes and said again.

She told me where the manager was and I  explained everything to the manager and the manager rolled. Manager also told me he has had multiple complaints about this Bruce. He asked if I wanted to talk with the owner of Kelseyville Lumber and I said sure.

When we got back to the office Bruce just came out of the door talking to the owner and had a stack of our business cards from the community board and ripped em in half and then handed  them to me with a smerk saying your not welcome here and this was right in from of the manager.

Bruce has horrible customer service skills. He should not be working there and it is a bad reflection on this company.

Who the heck runs this Kelseyville Lumber?The window and door department????

Cause next thing that happens is the owner did not want to talk.

I WANT AN APPOLOGY FROM THIS BRUCE IN WINDOW AND DOOR SECTION OF KELSEYVILLE LUMBER!!!!!!!!!

I will no longer be treated like this and I will do business elsewhere.< /Text><pics>None</pics><Response>{'time': 1557327370192, 'text': 'We are sorry to hear you had a poor experience with one of our employees.

New resident of kelseyville, but I've used kelseyville lumber since the old location. Although the store has grown, it still maintains the hometown feel. Never had a problem finding help if needed. Great people. Love spending my money locally.</Review>

This place has everything! Their lumber selection is the best around. The prices are about 10-15% higher than in Napa, but because they're local it's worth it. I'll  continue to go back.</review>

< Review>
This business allowed my stolen credit card to be used and does not use the proper security for transactions. Looks like they will be responsible for the fraudulent charges.<//Review>

Big store and they have quite a bit. Unfortunately, you won't find low prices and it'll be rare that you see anything on sale.<//text>

<Response>{'time': 1480353263436, 'text': 'We would like to begin by apologizing for your bad experience.  All of this has been brought to the owners and managers attention.  It is unfortunate another customer insulted you, but I am sure you understand it is out of our control how that person reacted or responded because of their own personal issues.  It is important to our company we provide excellent customer service and our customers feel comfortable and welcome in our store.  This will be addressed with every one of our employees and used in our staff training.\nAs for the 20-day preliminary notice, it is required by California State law to send these notices to contractors, home owner’s & lenders (if applicable) on any purchases over $400 on materials provided to a construction project.  We do not send these until the purchases have been made.  We are required to send within 20 calendar days from the date of 1st purchase over the $400 amount.'}<//Response>< gmap_id>

<Text>It's a nice walk on calm days. Watch for waves and pot holes. There are warnings telling you not to walk out on the jetty but you can make your own decision based on the conditions. Grab a coffee and friend and head out.<//Text>< pics>

Fun little town and a very neat feature. It's an easy walk all the way out. This isn't a bad way to stretch your legs during a long car ride. There was a decent brewery not too far away too.</Text>

The stroll was worth the water scenery comparative between the bay and the open ocean. Be ready for a 20 minute walk. I enjoyed the unique concrete water breaks and the fog horn sound as I strolled. You also get a good view of the lighthouse during the journey to the end of the jetty.</Text>

< Review>
The Jetty is awesome and has a lot of historic information all around it. You might have to go anywhere to Crescent City to figure out why the cement structures are there and shape that way but it's worth the journey. I did not make it to the lighthouse because I do not allow dogs which I wish they told me that when I was out in the parking lot but I may have missed the sign. Didn't want to leave my dogs in the car on a hot day. But it was a awesome Journey walking around the area I come back every single time :-)<//Review>

Cool stop for us. We walked along the beach to stop at the lighthouse. Stayed up there for 30 min or so and snapped some pictures of the beach.

If you hit it at the right time, you may be able to see some whales!</review>

I highly recommend this place to anyone that loves the sound of the ocean. The waves crashing against the jetty along with the sound of the seabirds is so relaxing. The fog rolls in so fast that the city disappears right before your eyes. It must be very popular with the locals. I could get use to taking early morning or evening walks with the puppies out here.< /Review>

< Review>
The walk down the Jerry to the ⚓ Anchor Graveyard was awesome. Got to see lots of wildlife :crabs, pelcians (most I have seen ) a black bird with a long orange beak (I do not know the name) Kill deer(Yes this is what the birds are called) Cranes and Blue Heron. Also, saw Harbor Seals ,squirrels and seagulls.
There's also a park area with picnic tables , beach access, and toilets. Beach area is Sandy and rocky is safe and clean for childern. Toilets are kept clean also.
Would recommend stopping here if your in the area.<//Review>

It's an okay place to stop by. It's a run down town and the sewage place is near by the lighthouse, sending a smell that you don't want to remember every 5 seconds. The bathrooms by the beach is not clean at all. I only gave it a 2 star because of the lighthouse and because I witness a humpback whale that day. Oh,  there is a little carnival near by. I didn't check it out, but if you have kids or to have a good time, that could be place to stop by.< /Review>

I’ve used wave house cleaning since March of 2021 and they have been amazing. The cleaners are professional and always arrive on time. I love how they are quick, efficient and also follow all necessary protocols with the covid pandemic. Since using their service I have referred them to countless friends and family and not one person have complained. The best thing is the bang for the buck we get due to their affordable prices for stellar cleaning.

I also appreciate their fast customer service response time if I had a hiccup and had to change my schedule for service at the last minute.</Text>

<review>I've been having Wave clean my home for some time now, and overall the experiences have been good.  The cleaning has been consistently well done, and staff is always friendly and attentive to questions/requests when in your home.

The only real disappointment has been a one-time event; one appointment was missed by over an hour, and I was not able to reach anybody by phone or email to confirm whether the staff still intended to come.  And this is minor, but generally Wave sends two people and the cleaning at my home takes around 90 minutes, and other times it's only one person and takes twice as long, so it's best to keep your schedule flexible.<//review>< user>

<Text>I've been using Wave House Cleaning for about a year and they are fantastic. They are very responsive to questions and concerns and their cleaners COVID protocols have been great. They do an excellent job and any feedback I've given about what I would like them to clean or how is always taken into consideration. Thank you so much for your help and service!<//Text></record></dataset><record>

Wave house did a great job! My place was honestly a mess when I was moving out, and the cleaner they sent did an amazing job at cleaning every single corner of the apartment. I got all of my deposit  back and the place looked spotless afterwards. The cleaner was also very nice!< /review>

<text>I've been using Wave for a several years now-- even through COVID--and I've been very happy with them. My apartment is clean and I don't have to dust! There have been a few occasions when the cleaner doesn't show up on time, but that's always been rectified quickly, and they're very responsive. Their precautions during the pandemic have made me feel very safe having them in my home. I think their pricing hits the sweet spot between being affordable for me and fair to the cleaners. Overall, I'm very glad I found Wave!< /text>< Rating>

<text>We had Antoineta come clean our home and she was incredible! She was so detailed and efficient. She didn't miss a single spot. She was so thorough that as she was leaving she started to sweep the leaves from our patio. We will definitely be using Wave House Cleaning again, especially if we can continue to get Antoineta!<//text>< Pictures>

I hired Sigolena very last minute for a move out clean and she did a fantastic job! My first time ever having anyone clean my place. She was very nice and had me check all the rooms before beginning with the next. $185 (plus tip), and it took just over 3hrs for a 1bd 1ba apt. Highly recommend having Sigolena clean your home!!< /Text>

We have been using Heather's service for some time now, after a seriously bad experience with another cleaning service is Alameda. We've had no problems with reliability and Heather has always been responsive to any concerns. We have a regular cleaner that we love, she does a wonderful job and is always a sweetheart to my ancient cat. Nothing but positives.</Review>

They do a pretty good job and it does vary between cleaners. It is a tad more expensive, however for the ease, reliability, flexibility and the fact that we don't regularly have a cleaner its worth it.  Dayana was the best so far and I asked about floors in kitchen and bathroom specifically and she made sure to focus on that and was super responsive via text when she finished.

<Text>It was very easy to book the first cleaning appointment online, and after that, I was able to set up monthly cleanings via email. Since then, Carlos and Rosi have been leaving my apartment amazingly clean. They work very efficiently and they get the job done quickly. Payments get automatically charged to my credit card, so it's nice not having to worry about writing checks or having cash available. Highly recommended!< /Text><UserId.>107151337202286743042< /UserId.><gmapID>0x80c2baebc264c881:0x628e34022c4460e4</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

I had a great experience with Sheila and Diogenes (and with others from this company in the past, but I forget who they were). This was a move-out cleaning. The apartment was extremely messy and I felt very stressed out about it. By the time they left, it was very clean and I was relieved! They were kind and pleasant. Money well spent. My only recommendation is if you don't speak decent Spanish, download a translation app or ask them to keep theirs handy. They used it some but not all of the time and it was helpful.< /Text>

< Review>
So I had to find someone who was willing to clean up after an epic party at a luxury condo. Emerson was very responsive to my request and showed up early! He has a great demeanor, hard work ethic, and very thorough in his work. He asked all the right questions (what countertops are stone so he can apply the correct cleaning methods). I would absolutely use him again and the first person I would call for cleaning services.</Review>

I have been using Heather's Home Cleaning for several months now.  I have found that they are very reliable and, most important, they care about my satisfaction as a customer.  Heather texts me after every visit to ask me how the cleaners' visit went.  I really like that.  There have been very few times I ever gave feedback about something that needed fixing/changing/redoing, but when I did, they took care of it right away.  I also like that the cleaners will suggest something regarding a potential problem area and we address it on the next visit.  I would recommend them to anyone.<//text>

Booking online short notice couldn't have been easier. I needed a move-out cleaning done within a couple of weeks and found Sparkling Clean Agency. There was tons of availability and I was able to lock down a weekend spot with Isabel and Edson.<//text>

Well worth the service, we're going to be scheduling a monthly cleaning!</review></record>

<Review>I so appreciate Wave House Cleaning.  We have a house in Torrance that was newly remodeled and they have been coming once a month to keep it in brand new condition.  I appreciate all you guys do and your time and effort you put into the cleaning.  We took a risk in signing up for this service because I didn't know anyone that had used it, but now I can say for sure this is GREAT!  They have come 3 times thus far and each time done a great job.  I would recommend them no problem. I also love the online booking ability.  So, techie and up to the 90's. LOL...

I highly recommend Wave House Cleaning. After doing some research and trials with several different companies, I was impressed with Wave. All the way from customer service, booking appointments online and the personnel that arrive are all outstanding. I have never ha Rb a problem. I’m comfortable leaving my house, running errands while the staff take good care of my home. The flexibility of appointment times are great too. I tend to make appointments last minute due to my busy schedule. Never have they let me down. I wIll continue to use their services and recommend them to f row da and family.<//Review>

<Review>Wow.  My house is cleaner than it's ever been.  From start to finish, Jaime and his crew did a spectacular job on the deep spring clean.  He was great at communicating, and is generally kind and thoughtful. The actual cleaning was so thorough and detailed. And no nasty chemicals!  The air in my house even feels clean.</Review>< Pictures>

I was very happy with my first experience. There was a small mishap with the arrival time (that’s the reason for the 4 stars). I scheduled them to get there before I went to work and they ended up being a little late past the end of their window of time because they couldn’t find parking. Once they finally told me, I went down and let them into my visitors parking. I’ll make sure that’s apparent next time. I let her in, she brought all her own stuff and I headed out. When I got back, everything looked great! Going to book again now for the start of the year!<//Review>

<text>I have used wave housecleaning multiple times in the past two years sometimes I use the deep cleaning and sometimes just the upkeep. I love love their customer service. I once ran into an issue of one of the cleaners blocking the sink(accidents do happen) and Juan the manager was more than just helpful to help resolve the issue. The cleaners are really nice too,  they come in , you have to just show them around and they're on their own I never had to supervise them,they check in with me when they're done and if I have any corrections they fix it.I love their business model,It is so easy to make an appointment on their website, their website is clean and very functional. And the best part is there is no time limit the cleaners take their time to make sure you're satisfied:)

I highly recommend wave cleaning! Here's to a cleaner house!<//text><gmap_id>0x80c2baebc264c881:0x628e34022c4460e4</gmap_id>< response>

<Review>Couldn't be happier with the service.

The cleaning professionals are always super sweet and friendly, and the place is always sparkling and spotless. I am always really happy with the results and automatic cleanings scheduled every 2 weeks.

The customer service teams are really helpful with booking/re-scheduling too.</Review><pictures>None</pictures><gmap_id>0x80c2baebc264c881:0x628e34022c4460e4<//gmap_id>< UserId.>

I really like this company. Toni was great to work with on scheduling.

We've used Leo twice now and he's incredible. He is quiet and unassuming, really sweet guy. He does great work and does it quickly.< /text>

Hi There,

We just wanted to let you know that we had a great experience with the last cleaner. I believe her name was Carla. I did not meet her personally but I came home to a house that didn't smell with any cleaners & everything was great. Very grateful.

It was the first time for us to be this happy. We would love to see her each time if this is possible. Thanks so much! She did a great job and we wanted you to know.

Best,
Mark and Monica<//Text>

Always have had great customer service with Wave and have been using them for 2 yrs.  If there is any issue they take care of you right away and are very nice to work with.  If a cleaner missed something Wave will have someone come out asap to finish the job if needed.  Elizabeth came out last week and she is wonderful so pleasant, professional, and does great work.< /Review>

Fabulous cleaning! It was easy to book, they arrived within the window of time, were great with my 2 dogs and had the place spotless!  I am so happy I left my previous service for them.   Everything from their wonderful disposition to customer service was great! After today's cleaning scheduled bi-weekly services. THANK YOU!!!<//text>

< review>
This company was a rip-off.  Their housekeeper spent only two hours doing what they called a "deep-cleaning" charging me $140 for a poor cleaning job with a Swiffer.  This was a move-out assignment and the homeowner was so unhappy with all the things that were missed she charged me $200 to have a two person crew come and clean for 3 hours to fix what Wave Housekeeping missed. Also, their housekeeper showed up way too early for the appointment window, left to get her eyebrows done, and then didn't come back until AFTER the appointment arrival window had closed.  She also had an attitude like it was my fault she was not on time.  I informed Wave Housekeeping of the issues, pictures, video and even copies of call records and emails from the homeowner.  After weeks of this I was given only a %35 refund despite their %100 gaurantee.  UPDATE: A day after I posted this review they gave me a FULL refund and the matter has been resolved satisfactorily.  I hope that other people who use their service have a better experience than I did.<//review>

Everything was great. We were in desperate need of a deep-clean for our 2 bd. 2 bath apartment. The ladies were there for about 3 hours and left the place looking better than it ever has! They're incredibly thorough - got into all the nooks and crannies and really helped with the problem areas that were our bathrooms and kitchen. We will absolutely be using Wave regularly!< /text>

Our house is absolutely IMMACULATE after Wave House Cleaning came. We had them come and clean our apartment after our tenant moved out, and it was better than when we bought it over a year previously. They were 30 minutes late, but that wasn’t really an issue because it was first thing in the morning. Also, we didn’t have power because the tenants were transitioning, and they brought a huge extension chord so they could plug in the hallway and still get vacuuming done. We booked them with only 2 days notice, and notified them about the power situation at midnight the night before and they were still good to go by 9:30 am. They brought 3 workers and were done in 2.5 hours for a 1,500 square foot condo. Highly recommend!<//text>

<Review>I highly recommend this company. The cleaners are professional and work quickly, but thoroughly. The first time I used the service I had dishes washed and some of them were had to be rewashed, but I've been satisfied with the rest of the cleaning and I have used it twice now.< /Review>< Pictures>

This was my first time using Wave House Cleaning, and I will definitely use them again. This is the best cleaning job yet. I think with any house cleaner you will have to tell them how you like certain things done, and after the cleaning I really had nothing to say. She was on time, so nice, thorough, and left my place sparkling. Very happy and would definitely recommend!</review>

We decided to use a service so that there would be a way to provide specific instructions and to give feedback. The crew assigned to us for our first visit arrived on time and were very detail-oriented. They brought all of there own equipment and cleaning supplies, even a large step ladder. Our house was very clean after they left. I'm looking forward to them coming again.<//Text>< Pics>

I have been looking for a good cleaning service for a long time. I have taken advice from Next Door, tried people that leave fancy fliers on my porch...all of them left something to be desired. Wave House has exceeded all of my previous experiences, by far. First off, the customer service is fantastic. They work with you to find the perfect time. When you find cleaners that you love, they make sure to place them with you for subsequent cleanings. The people that work for this company are efficient, sweet, and professional. Thanks, Wave House!<//Review>

Great cleaning service that goes above and beyond. Their staff is kind and does an awesome job. Wave House also supports the local community by highlighting local causes to donate time and/or money to. I know, because they helped me with a personal cause of my own! Very inspiring group of people. Thank you Wave House!<//text>

I love this service - they have always been extremely reliable, coming on time (even though they give a 1 hour window) and my 3 bedroom 2 bath house is clean within 2 to 2.5 hours. I did the deep cleaning first and I got the fridge cleaned too. Now  I just clean every two weeks and I am very satisfied with the service. I request Carlos and Maria, who are a really great team and seem to find every nook and cranny of my dust & dirt.  Really nice people to work with. It's also very easy to set up my appointments. I just email and ask for availability. They have 3 possible times. I find the prices very reasonable. Thank you Wave!< /Text>

I was moving out the day-of, called wave cleaning and they sent a cleaner that evening. The place looks spotless, he cleaned under the stovetop and between sink/tub (hard to see or reach areas). Very friendly cleaner and very helpful. Would def rec using them & I plan on doing so as well. Super did a walkthrough with no concerns after cleaning.< /text>

<Text>I've had Wave House Cleaning clean my house twice so far and I am so happy with the quality of their work that I set up ongoing bi-weekly service. The staff has always arrived on time and are pleasant, professional and thorough. I love the email reminders a couple of days before the scheduled cleaning. Juan provides excellent customer service and wants to make sure there is 100% customer satisfaction. I am so glad that I found Wave House Cleaning!<//Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

Great experience and now an ongoing customer. Hired them after the holidays while deep in wedding prep. The cleaner arrived on time and did a bang up job. Nothing was missed. Apartment looked great for relatives and friends visiting.< /text>

Wave Cleaners are great. It's nice that it feels like a small operation, vs Handy that feels like a machine and the cleanings aren't as thorough. We have found a set of cleaners through Wave that we've requested to come back next time since they did such a good job (nice little touches like arranging the pillows and towels don't go unnoticed!). We originally had a woman coming independently to our house, but we moved across town and she couldn't come that far. So we started using Handy, but the service was impersonal and it didn't feel like the cleaners were personally invested in doing their best. We found Wave on Yelp and they've been great - quick responses and helpful. I hope their next step is to make an app or online appointment system to make it even easier. Very satisfied with this service and will continue to use. Thanks Wave!<//review>

<review>My wife and I decided to try Wave before a house guest came to visit.  We have tried other cleaning services in the area like Handy and Tidy, and the results from those other services were very disappointing.  We went with Wave based on the positive online reviews, and I'm very happy that I did.  Zulma showed up on time (within the hour window we had chosen).  She was kind, positive, and needed no instruction.  She brought all of her own supplies, including mop and vacuum, and by the time she was done, the house was spotless.  We was particularly impressed with how well she cleaned out the inside of the oven.  It looked brand new!  Great service, reasonable price.  We will definitely be recurring customers.<//review><rate>5<//rate></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
I just had my first cleaning with Wave this week - great experience overall! There was some initial confusion when I tried to leave a voicemail twice (that they said they didn't receive), but they are incredibly responsive by email, so that seems like the best way to contact them. On the day of cleaning the office called to let me know that my house cleaners were running about 10-15 minutes late - I really appreciated this contact as I was waiting at home to get them started. My initial cleaning was a "deep clean" and I'm very satisfied with the results! I will definitely use Wave again on a regular basis.</Review>

Wow! Thanks for the wonderful service. Maria from Waves cleaning service was on time, speedy, and worked really hard. My house is the cleanest it has ever been (and it was pretty filthy!) . Kitchen, bathrooms, baseboards, carpets, floors... all super clean... I highly reccomend her! And will absolutely use her again.</Text>

I was incredibly apprehensive to hire cleaners, as I never have before, and I was very pleasantly surprised by Wave House.  They arrived promptly at the time designated, allowing me to get to work on time, and when I stopped back home around lunch everything was immaculate.  The two cleaners had done everything from wiping the blinds to putting away our dishes to making our beds - and they even remembered to bring back the visitor parking pass I lent them!  The customer service was also very helpful and responsive in crediting me for the Yelp deal I purchased.<//Review>

I have been using Wave for several years. I use email to communicate with them mostly and for the most part service is very good. Sometimes things get crossed but they have always accepted their actions and given me good customer service.  When the previous clean person I had moved away I had one bad person. Wave did a fabulous job of making it right and then sent me Sarah. She is awesome and I couldn't be happier!</text>

Booked Wave House for their cleaning services twice so far in the few weeks and had the pleasure of Alejandro & Ariana's service both times! They are super professional, thorough, and fast! They arrive equipped with their products and tools, but are so accommodating in using the organic cleaning products I have at home. I've recommended them to my friends!!</Text>

<review>I've been using Wave for about 9 months now.  I live alone (with a big dog) in a moderately sized 2 bedroom apartment and I'm a very neat person, so I only have them come once a month to frankly do the things I don't want to do, like clean the showers and my stove.  They do a great job and the women who have come into my home couldn't have been nicer or more friendly to my dog (which is very important to me).

Speaking of showers, it's often the little things that define quality of service.  This week the woman who cleaned my place got my glass shower door cleaner than I've ever been able to get it.  It's long suffered from years and years of hard water and soap deposits.  Not even CLR could get it all clean.  But after this week's cleaning it is completely clear. I don't know what she used, but it was amazing.

It's also often how a company handles service issues that defines quality of service.  The one time I contacted the office about something the cleaner missed (a floor left wet after being cleaned), they got back to me almost immediately and offered to send someone to fix the situation right away.<//review>< gmap_id>

<Review>We have gone through five different cleaning services before landing at Wave. I wish I met them from day one. Prompt, very competitive pricing, friendly, accommodating, and overall, the cleaning team did a superb job! Our 3bd/3bath all tile home smelled and felt great after they left. It has been a long time since we had that feeling after a cleaning company left our home. I highly recommend Wave and have signed up for their monthly service!<//Review>< Response>

Our house is "garden level" and had gotten VERY dusty and moldy after three years of sub par self cleaning. We scheduled a deep clean with Delia & Amarilis and they did a wonderful job! For the first time this month, I haven't had to take allergy meds as soon as I got home. They were on time and professional. Will definitely call Wave House Cleaning again.</review>

The service is great, you can schedule times via website or email.  I have a regular recurring appointment but they are able to accommodate changes, easily.  Payments are set up online, so no need to deal with leaving a check or cash for the cleaner.  The add on options are great so that the pricing for a general clean is low, and if you need more you can request ala carte.  Their customer service is helpful and responsive.  Simple, easy, no hassle.< /review>

I've had recurring housekeeping services from different sources while living in dtla, Beverly hills, and Santa Monica. So far, I find Yalsi from Wave to be the most consistent. For the past 6 months, I had scheduled her to come every 3 weeks--she's always on time, quick, and thorough. The price is also very reasonable. The admin staff is also great as they are very easy to reach and communicate with via email or phone. I have recommended Wave to many of my friends and colleagues already.

Update: Few years later, I have moved to a much bigger house in another city and still impressed with Wave Cleaning. Great customer service, ease of scheduling, punctual, competitive prices, and impeccable cleaning! What more can I ask? :)<//text>

I've been wanting to have periodic maid service for some time, however, my significant other is not very trusting after she had some jewelry boosted by some movers.  I convinced her that we'd go with a company that is insured and I'd leave work early to be at the home while the cleaning occurred.  After scouring Yelp and Google reviews and their straight forward pricing, I decided to go with Wave House Cleaning.

Scheduling was a breeze.  I scheduled for a 3PM cleaning.  I got home at 2:45PM and the maid was already there!  I opened the door and the maid (Marisol?) got right to work, attacking the master bath first.  No easy task as my gf uses a number of hair/aerosol products that cause a layer of gunk to build up on the flat surfaces in the bathroom.  I spot checked and she got everything...very impressed!

The maid did my entire 2 bedroom/2 bath apartment in about 3 hours and 20 minutes.  This was their "deep clean" as required for the 1st cleaning.

My apartment is all hardwood floors with area rugs.  Not sure I would have been impressed with the vacuum the maid brought if I had more carpeting but was sufficient for my apartment's needs.

The customer service was great.  I got a call the morning of the cleaning to confirm and had all my questions answered.  I definitely plan on using them again before my parents visit in mid-September.<//Review>

<review>I've had the best experience with Wave House Cleaning so far! I've used them 3 times and have been so happy with the results each time.

I have a 1 bedroom apartment and paid $109.99 for the initial deep clean (she cleaned everywhere, even the walls!) and have paid $69.99 for the subsequent cleans.  The cleaners have arrived within the hour time frame they give you and usually on the earlier side.

The length of time the cleaners are there have varied (maybe due to how much I have "pre-cleaned?").  Everything looks sharp and organized when they leave.  For the price and service, I will be sticking with Wave House Cleaning as long as I can!!</review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

<Review>I've become a loyal customer of WHC. Had 4 or 5 cleanings already. Last time Irma did a great job with deep cleaning.Came in earlier, left my place perfectly clean and shiny with little touches of care. All things were at their places. WHC management has been always responsive to my requests and changes. Continue sticking with them.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

<date>1488352758562< /date><rating>5< /rating><text>I've had my house cleaned about 5-6 times by Wave House and it was a perfect experience every time.
Scheduling was very easy, the cleaners were always on time, and they were done on time or earlier than they said they would be. Customer service is also great, they always reply to my emails same day or by the next day and to my phone calls within an hour or so.

Having a very young child at home, I was looking for a cleaning company that uses green products. They said that they use neutral products, and in fact there is no strong odor from the cleaning solutions after they've finished. Just a light lemon scent which is gone after airing out my apartment briefly. I haven't had a bad experience yet and look forward to continue having my house cleaned by them.</text><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

I first hired Wave House Cleaning in October. Unfortunately, my first two experiences weren't stellar (the first service was a "deep cleaning" but didn't vacuum/mop under any furniture, didn't clean or move kitchen counter appliances, wipe cupboards, etc). But when I submitted my honest feedback, I received a prompt reply and apology with an offer to send another cleaner out to finish the job, The second cleaner did do a better job, but didn't have a very positive attitude about it. Again, the Wave manager apologized and the third team was the CHARM! Their "basic cleaning" was much more thorough than the first "deep cleaning" - and more - even wiping down every bottle in the bathrooms and kitchen. - and repeat 3 weeks later.
As long as I can continue to get the same team - I can say I'm very happy with Wave House Cleaning!<//Review>

<text>I recently received services and I was pleased for the most part. Overall, the cleaning was to my liking, however, I wish they'd move countertop appliances and cleaned underneath and behind those areas. Same in bathrooms, they do not move anything. They clean the sink, the tub, toilet, but did not move my stand (four drawers) to clean underneath and behind it. My microwave and crockpot along with my Keurig and pod holder were not moved.
My hubby suggested we just move those things next time to have those areas cleaned as well.
As I stated, the overall service ( arrival, professionalism, and attitude) was good.
I will use again and see if the adjustments are helpful.</text>< pics>

< Review>
My first visit here in September  2020 was pleasant.  The staff was fantastic I arrived hungry and one of the Front desk clerks says, "I have some popcorn you can have". Trying to get where I needed to be, after arriving I had no time to stop. But the rooms looked just as they did on the site. My room was clean, the restaurant however was closed due to COVID 😔.</Review>

<Text>I always thoroughly enjoy my stay here. Even though I'm an LA native, this is my little secret getaway space. Feels like I've traveled to an old world vacation spot in the Mediterranean. On this particular visit the woman who checked me in was very pleasant and engaged in a little personable banter which I much appreciated.  She even advised the new offering of wine available at the front desk!

The room was clean and I absolutely adore the rooms which lead to the courtyard.

Will absolutely be back soon.

Thank you to you and your wonderful staff.<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

Our stay was amazing! Simply too short. A special shout out to Jacioto, I trust this is the correct spelling of  his name for his extraordinary service upon checking in. Unfortunately, our room was not cleaned the following day, but we chose not to say anything as we were checking out the following morning. I believe this was mostly an oversight. Otherwise, great!< /review>

<Text>Excellent hotel! It has easy access to the 405. Beautifully furnished. Large rooms. Downside is the noise in the room; some from outside (better than expected traffic noise), but mostly from inside the hotel (hall doors closing, it's not 4:30 am here and someone is taking a shower and it sounds like they are in my shower).<//Text><user_id>117713539753656748229< /user_id>< gmap_id>

So beautiful. I felt like I was walking into a European museum. Great grand staircase. Lovely back patio for enjoying the weather and near the pool/hot tub.

Beautiful furnishings throughout the hotel. Will definitely look for Ayers Hotels in the future.< /Review>

Amazing, beautiful hotel located in perfect distance from literally everything! Only “issue” that we had was housekeeping. This could be due to Covid-19 contact procedures but we’ve always been used to having our room (garbage) picked up daily while we’re out. Other than that amazing hotel and even better desk staff!</Review>

Ayres Hotel Manhattan beach. This is my little secret get away. Ayres hotel Manhattan Beach is one of the properties of the Ayres Hotels. However, this property in Manhattan Beach is very very special and unique set apart from all the other Ayres Hotels in Southern California

As soon as you walked into the hotel lobby you will never forget that the stunning grand stairs case and the huge tapestry wall hanging behind the front desk. The hotel have the old chateau feel, from the painting to the grand fireplace in the lobby, all the antiques craved wood furnitures, you almost forgot you  are in Manhattan Beach, California.

The staffs are very lovely and wonderful, they would try their best to accommodate your needs and request to make your stay unforgettable.

The rooms are very spacious, the executive suite are even bigger with separate living room and bed room. My personal favorite executive suite is room 413 it’s on the top floor and at the corner with very high ceiling.
However, all the rooms that facing the courtyard are wonderful.

The hotel located off the 405 freeway so it’s very convenience.

Top it all, I was very surprised the rate of this luxury hotel is very affordable. That’s a Plus +
It make you feel good about the money you spent is totally worth it !

So if you ever travel to Southern California and the beach Cities you should defiantly check this hotel out and see if you agreed.

It’s definitely
⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

We booked this hotel through Hotels.com as it was conveniently located near the Airport and Manhattan Beach.

Our initial reception was fantastic - friendly check in representative who was welcoming and helpful.  The list of positives ends there.

When we got to the room (room 405) we discovered blood stains on bed sheets, comforter, and towels.  Not just one stain, multiple stains in multiple places (sheets, comforter, bath towels).  Talk about making your skin crawl. Of course our initial inclination was that the room had not been cleaned or sanitized, and we are in the middle of a freaking pandemic.

We immediately went downstairs and  asked another front desk representative to send housekeeping to change all the linens (sheets, comforter, bath towels) while we were at dinner.

We also asked to speak to the manager, he was no where to be found, but we were advised that he (Jairo) would call us to discuss the problem.

Needless to say, Jairo never called.

Upon our late return from dinner, we found the room exactly how we had found it earlier, blood stains on all the linens.

We went down to inform another front desk representative to let them know, at 12:45am, to be told that housekeeping has left for the day and that they didn't have anyone to change the sheets.

The midnight desk clerk again vehemently denied that blood stains on the linens were possible until I showed him the photos. After showing him photo after photo he agreed to change our room to room 454.  And again he promised that one of the mangers Jairo, or Jack Ellis, would contact us immediately in the morning.

Again, no manager reached out to us.

Room 454 looked fine, however just being on the same floor as the bloody room left me feeling uneasy and nauseous all night.

Next day, we informed the check out clerk of the same issue, asking to talk to a manager, to be told that there is no manager on duty.  She mentioned again that Jack Ellis is the one to speak with, she said he is the front desk manager, and would give us a call to remedy the situation but we haven't received the call yet.

This hotel make no attempts at customer service.

I realize that doing business during a pandemic is difficult, but the management at this hotel should be on premises to deal with customers concerns and complaints.  This is truly an unacceptable way to do business, or to treat your clientele.< /Text>

My family and I had an amazing time! The art and décor created an exceptional ambiance that was both stimulating and relaxing. The rooms were very big and nice for the price. We stayed for 6 nights and had trouble even leaving the hotel some days because of how comfortable we were there!</Review>

Room was clean and they brought fresh towels to the door. I don't like that Covid has taken the hospitality out of the Hospitality Industry. The night clerk at the front desk was welcoming and friendly NOT the case the next morning with the woman at the front desk. Since that is now our only interaction with the hotel you would think they would bend over backwards to be kind and courteous. I guess it's just something else they can blame on Covid? I was also surprised that I would need to pay for wifi past my fiirst night. Again NOT very hospitible given all the other things we have to give up.<//Review>

I love the decor. It is old world charm. The TV is small and the power outlets are limited. Please be aware they do not have USB plugs only limited power plugs. I like it because it feels cozy and safe. It is kind of expensive and the parking... not sure why they charge for parking. The location is convenient. I would not recommend children to stay here.  This is for adults in my opinion.</text>

If you love the renaissance look, with statues, brocade, paintings then this is your place!
Check in is quick. Front desk staff is helpful. Due to covid the bar & restaurant has been closed. The hotel is located by lots of stores & restaurants so there are options.
The room was clean & big! Bed was comfy. My stay was short, so I didn't get to check out everything.</review>

Stayed here the night before my wedding, and my wedding night. We had our bridal party here as well. My suite was very spacious and I loved it. We planned on using the lobby for our portrait pictures but we were running behind on everything. Overall loved everything about this place, we stayed at discounted rate because we booked many rooms for our bridal party and guests.<//Review>

I thought the property was very beautiful and well decorated. The rooms were very clean and comfortable. A plus was that the Guest representative saw that we had stayed at other Ayres Hotels and inquired about our stay and shared some Historical information about the artwork and furniture. It was very informative. I will definitely be coming back!< /Review>

<text>Loved the whole building! I loved the small library, the huge chimney and the art paintings and pictures all around the place. And also loved the fact that it was not very crowded at the time I was there. I only feel sorry about not being able to try the restaurant inside the hotel. Hopefully, next time. Cheers!< /text>< Response>

<review>Last minute trip and only needed a room for one night. This place was almost perfect. Right off freeway, easy access, and plenty of nearby restaurants. The place was clean, decor was a great addition, and the rooms are bigger than average and equivalent to a large studio apartment. The ONLY thing that is preventing me from giving 5 stars is the tv in our room wouldn’t turn on and there was no remote. we didn’t mention anything until the morning as we were out for the evening and literally only came back to sleep, however, it was a bit of an inconvenience not having something for the kids to watch in the morning. Other than that the hotel was perfect and we’d stay again. Also thank you to the front concierge staff for not seeming rude or annoyed by my two children walking around the library area to look at the art pieces. I really appreciate the fact that you made us feel welcomed.</review>< GmapID>

I am in love with this place. Every corner is absolutely beautiful. The rooms are huge, very spacious bathroom, comfortable bed. The whole hotel is gorgeous, I really want to go back. Really bummed I only spent one night there. Would definitely love to go back and just enjoy it. The staff was also nice and helpful.< /review>

I don't often leave reviews but our experience with this hotel was majorly disappointing. The room itself was fine. Customer service was terrible. We stayed one night and in the morning found our car had been hit while parked in their (nearly empty) lot. Luckily we were within sight of their security cameras, but hotel staff was not willing to give us the footage, review it themselves, or provide it to police or insurance - they pretty much just told us it was our problem to deal with and sent us on our way without trying to help in any way. Not what we expected from a "luxe" hotel. Disappointed and we will never be staying here again.</Review>

<Text>Positive: What I did like best about the hotel is the exterior upkeep despite the lobby being cheaply done rather than dated is a bit of a turn off . The architecture of the place is nice but the overall property and rooms needs renovation, Negative: What I didn¿t like about the hotel is the lighting . This is not the location for social media influencers, the bathroom is dated lobby and hallways, horrible lighting.  I think they have a bed bug problem and they hold ur deposit up to 10 days.< /Text><pics>None< /pics>< gmap_id>

on sunday 3/7/21there was no hot water.  when I called the front desk, I was told a boiler was turned off.  I would have hot water in a few hours.  I was scheduled to visit a family that I had not seen in over 30 years.  I had to go without a shower and felt I did not look or feel clean,  I returned that night to hot water. I think there were too many people taking hot showers at once as there was a traveling soccer club staying there.<//review>

I stayed at the Ayres Hotel in Mission Viejo 6 weeks ago and they had coffee and breakfast and afternoon snacks, 6 weeks ago. I was and am very disappointed that the Manhattan Beach Ayres did not offer breakfast. We drove in from Vegas on Sunday for doctors appointments first thing Monday morning. We were on very tight schedules and the lack of this service was, as I said , very disappointing. When I made the reservation the least your desk help could have done was notify me that no services would be available, especially since your Mission Viejo Hotel was offering services 6 weeks earlier.<//review>

<Review>This place is great. Love the art and the decorations. Has a really great atmosphere. Rooms are a little dated but I think that’s part of the atmosphere. The bed could be a little bit more comfortable, but the rooms were very clean and quiet. Easy to get on and off the highway and across the street for some good food options. Don’t miss the pool, hot tub and fitness center!< /Review>< pics>

< Review>
Love it... I've been wanting to stay here for a while. I check it out every time I go to Costco😊 and I wasn't disappointed. Sadly I didn't get a chance to take some pictures But the room was very nice, spacious and cozy. There's a cute half wall with wooden shutters separating the King bed area equipped with the basics.... two end tables, lamps, writing desk and chair, from a sitting area with a couch, coffee table, small round dining table with two chairs. An armoire with the TV. The cabinet with mini fridge, microwave and coffee pot is right there when you first walk in the door and spacious bath next to that.  Price was good. $98 + tax. It's right across the way from Costco, McDonald's and several other places in the shopping center. Conveniently accessible off the 405 FWY.  I will definitely be back for hopefully a #Staycation for several days. With pics to match ☺️</Review>

<Text>Great location for our needs, but because of Covid no dining was available on site. Fast food and pizza was nearby, but nice restaurants were a hike. A couple minor issues with amenities.<//Text>< username>

This hotel is beautiful inside. The rooms are clean. However, staff is slow. We did not get all the bedding requested for the sleeper sofa. The window would not completely close in the room. Which we did not find out until later in the evening. Upon check out the front desk person was on a personal call. Rudely pushed the bucket for me to place the key card into. I was unable to tell her the issue with the window. There were zero USB charging ports in the room. After staying at several other Ayres locations, I doubt I would return to this one.< /Review>

I wish we would have discovered this chain earlier and stayed here the whole time! It was beautiful, peaceful, quiet. The room was roomier than your average hotel room. The bathtub was extra deep. The mattress was perfection - like sleeping on a cloud. Absolutely loved the old European decor, the personal library, the unique furnishings throughout.

<Text>From day one until I checked out, everything here was so amazing. The staffs are really exceptional with their service, and the room is really comfortable. I could not ask for more from these guys because I was greatly satisfied with the foods, facilities, services, and any other things that they are offering. I will definitely leave them a good review!

Since we discovered the Ayres hotels in 2020 my fiance and I have been huge fans. When covid hit last spring, my fiance and I were getting ready to move into an apartment but the entire state of California shut down and we were forced to stay in a hotel for several months. We were obviously disappointed but there was 1 very big silver lining. We discovered the Ayres hotels! We spent 2 months at the ayres location in Mission Viejo which as amazing! So when we were needing a hotel close to LAX, we found an Ayres hotel in Manhattan Beach. Not only was the hotel close to the airport but the quality of the hotel was top notch! The rooms are spacious, the bed was so comfortable. The staff was incredible, they really went the extra mile to make sure our stay was pleasurable and relaxing. The hotel is beautiful inside and out with an immaculate swimming pool and spa. They offer a gym with everything you need to get in a good workout and when your done, they provide a complimentary shuttle to and from the beach. With as much as my fiance and I travel, its really nice knowing that whichever Ayres Hotel we  stay at, our stay will be amazing!<//Review>

The wallpaper, sconces, drapes, furniture, and carpet were gorgeous, clean, and opulent. I loved the room for the decor, the 12pm checkout time, and free parking (for the time.) The atmosphere of the common areas are just as well clean, and I never saw one cleaning person in the hotel, on the floor in passing. The staff does a great job of maintaining the hotel.< /Review>< Date>

Honestly, I am a fan of the AYERS Hotel chain (theres one near my home too that I staycation at as well) this is my HOME, away from HOME!   I STAYCATION here (when Im in LA area) as much as I can ALONE.  Its a very Clean, Quiet, Safe location, the staff is AMAZING, especially JACK!  The price is affordable and I love the look & vibe of the room and its spacious too.  I tend to get alot of work done when I come to LA and stay at this location. Thank you Ayers.< /text>

I've stayed here before and enjoyed their Victorian accommodations but this time was just ok. They are doing renovations and really should have the 3rd floor closed off right now because it simply looks a hot mess and you must walk through this right off the elevator to get to your room. At the least, it should be cleaned regularly! When I spoke to the one of the woman at the front desk she tried to rationalize to me that they are remodeling and pointed to a sign saying so. I realized there was no sense in going back and forth with her so I spoke with the manager Jack later that day. He immediately apologized for everything moved me to another floor. He was very accommodating but her attitude still left a bad taste in my mouth. I am undecided whether I will return again.  But I do like the proximity to the 405 freeway and 7 minutes from LAX (through local streets).<//text>

<Review>Positive: The hotel was central to every location -- Hollywood, Venice Beach, Long Beach, etc. It's a beautiful hotel with a fire going every night. My son would run his lines downstairs by the fire once we got back to the hotel each night. Great experience!!! Negative: Nothing at all! From the staff, the ambiance, to the location, everything was perfect!!<//Review>< userid>

Avoid rooms on the side the gas station is on,  lots noise from customers playing music loud,  people park in the empty lot, and the fwy nose . Quiets down around 1am, so if you're looking for a relaxing experience which i was ,avoid that side and lower floors, you hear everything above you. Otherwise everything else was very accommodating.</text>

Great Service. Upon arrival check in was fast and smooth. I had requested for my room to be on a certain floor and my request was granted. Would highly recommend if you are out traveling or even if working. Relaxing atmosphere and welcoming staff! Don't forget to use their hot TUB!!<//Text>

Upon arrival I mentioned that I was hungry and tired, the young man who checked me in gave me two bags of popcorn, as I had mentioned I wish I had known that the rooms had microwaves. I really liked the look of the hotel, the old world charm, that is what made me choose to stay there, but in person, I liked it even more. So please during the renovations try and keep some of the old world charm.</Text>< pics>

(4.5  ⭐️) Was here for several days for a company event. The staff are wonderful and the hotel is very nice inside. It’s a European styled interior with a beautiful courtyard. My room was large and more like a king suite. The bed was a little mushy in spots but not too bad. The only thing that I had issues with were minor annoyances like room keys not working (for a number of people). The location next to the I-405 is not that great either. There’s was at least one homeless man wandering the property to the highway.

Their service to the conference rooms and the food service was excellent.< /text>

<Text>I am a essential worker and the Ayres was referred to me.
I love the hotel set up! I felt like a Queen in the very first room I was assigned.
I am still feeling Queenish even though I have to clean my own room.
The hotel is absolutely gorgeous!
The front desk staff made me feel very welcome!

The whole stay at The Ayres Hotel Manhattan Beach/ LAX was wonderful. The location was great with restaurants and shops so close by. Everything in the hotel was maintained very well, the room was super clean, the beds and furniture were very comfortable and the appliances worked very well. The whole decor of the room and the whole hotel was stunning! It made us feel like we travelled back in time to Renaissance era France. All the staff were exceptional! The front desk managers Jack and Jairo were extremely nice, friendly, helpful, kind and very efficient. Also the rest of the staff Anaide, Reuben, Phillip and Aileen were amazing, they were always very helpful, sweet, kind, friendly and very efficient as well. Everyone made us feel very welcome and the hospitality was exceptional. Our stay at The Ayres Hotel was unforgettable as we really loved it and it began to feel like home to us because everyone was so wonderful. We have referred all our friends, colleagues and family to stay at The Ayres Hotel Manhattan Beach/LAX whenever they visit LA!</Text>

<review>They're passionate staff who could bring a smile on your face. On top, they offered me some typical food of Bali, so I could taste some fruits and nuts, really delicious!! The place is relaxing which is located in a quiet place & neighborhood. You could have your family bond here. The area is harmless, especially for the kids.</review>< Time>

< Review>
We have stayed in many wonderful Hotels all over the world & this was certainly 1 of them.  The  Reception Staff, in particular, Jack,  Nataly, Aleene & Nicole who were incredibly helpful & nothing was too much trouble.  The decor & the ambience of this beautiful property was so elegant & classy.  So many beautiful rooms to relax in,  open fireplace & pool & spa were also very inviting.  The Restaurant served great food & staff were lovely . Would highly recommend staying here, as it was also close to some great eating places.</Review>

We had a great experience at this hotel. The hotel is cozy and decorated with many antiques. The room is spacious and clean. The room has a wall to separate two queen beds and is good for family. I love the garden and patio. The staffs are very gentle and kind. You can feel like a 5 star hotel. I strongly recommend to experience this hotel.</text>

I was a little disappointed as i enjoyed the view upon arrival..the central grand staircase and vintage decor..but as i entered my room it was stripped down and vacant dirty in gr terms..also the second room i was given in replacement of non ready room upon arrival smelled of a hospital room with an actual sick person in it..the air was stale and the smell was just like a hospital. But the pool was beautiful and it was quiet ..a bit busy at night in the parking lots but it was nice..oh yes and remember to dust those cobwebs off of the walls and decor in the bedrooms ..gives it a spooky dusty vibe< /review>

I had previously posted a poor review due to hot water issues in my room.  The hotel corrected those issues and the rest of my stay was a pleasure.  The courtyard is a nice place to sit and work in the nice Southern California winter weather.< /review>

< Review>
My stay at the Ayres hotel was great! Staff was very helpful, the food in their restaurant was great, and they provide a free shuttle to Manhattan Beach and surrounding close areas. I was very satisfied with my stay. The two ladies Stephanie and (I forgot the other young lady name) was at the front desk and they REALLY were accommodating. Me and my husband couldn't thank them enough! I'd definitely come back.<//Review>

<text>The Ayres Hotel was a wonderful place for our retreat. The rooms are spacious and have everything you need from a comfy bed, living space, TV, microwave, and fridge. The staff are all very friendly and accommodated our every need. Since we had a photoshoot there, the architecture and design lent itself to a fun and elegant shoot. We'll definitely be back again.</text><Pictures>None</Pictures><UserId.>109726046724708359138<//UserId.><Resp>None< /Resp>< GmapID>

I was a little unsure about booking because the lack of photos but I'M GLAD I DID! It was a BEAUTIFUL property! Check in was fast, easy & the gentleman who checked us in was very nice. The standard double queen room was much more spacious than I envisioned. My family & I will definitely stay here again if in the area ^_^<//text>

<Pictures>None< /Pictures><text>Checked-into this hotel with the intention of using their pool, jacuzzi, and loved that it was central to the Manhattan Beach business district plus the beach. I needed to get away from my native San Francisco due to the quarantine mandates, plus it was central to LA so I was close enough to visit family. It seemed like a great idea and location. It was just me, late 20's female. Needless to say, the hotel itself looks great but their management was terrible. Not to mention the folk that frequent the hotel had more of a motel vibe than anything else. There were families that were extremely loud down some of the corridors, where in others it seemed like a brothel, if you know what I mean. Beware of shifty people that roam the property.  This was not the peaceful stay I was hoping for. They also shut down the pool and jacuzzi without letting anyone know. On my last day someone pulled the fire alarm. At check-in I was told that I could not stay at my original booked room due to "unexpected" construction. On my last day, I asked to speak to a manager where I was informed he had stepped-out and would call me back, never happened. They had the decency of comping me a mere $50. If you want a motel vibe stay here. The remodeling and look of the place is very deceptive. Not at all a boutique hotel. If you're looking for an affordable spot close to the business district, beware of the horrible management, unexpected changes, plus how loud it is. Personally, very disappointed.<//text>< gmapID>

Lovely Victorian style Hotel. Warm colors and lovely bedrooms that make you feel like you walked into a time period. Green rooms to save energy, parking was included and close, staff was friendly. The Matisse was closed which I love but they had snack options and several near by eateries. Just relaxing!<//Text>

<Review>The hotel had a power outage for about 30 minutes during our stay, the pillows were TERRIBLE (no support), and the TV size was comparable to a laptop. Not sure how this hotel got 4 stars, but even with the deal, I felt cheated.<//Review>< gmapID>

The Ayres Hotel in Manhattan Beach is so incredibly beautiful and clean. I felt like I was at a little boutique hotel in Italy. The food was also just as amazing. I will always stay here every time I have to be in LA. Thank you!!!< /Review>

<Rate>4</Rate><review>Pleasantly surprised bye this hotel! The interiors are gorgeous and the hotel smells so good! It reminded us on Haunted Mansion at Disneyland. They only lose one star for really bad WiFi. There is only one elevator and ice machine per level. We are on the fourth floor and on the complete opposite side of the elevator so this was a little inconvenient. We did not hear the highway at all which was nice.< /review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNNMRkSgdgzjkYlH6EUiGuRPaRmLU-0wJDeKaKK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNxPNfNNJT6VHDHR018iL2BnhJnsWlK0K-ZYIg6=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOq5hTcrBKP8rlOATxr2YiYoFIwFeYo5uULDAaG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP8MQRqsr97XAqxt8bbK-78W1t7g4koRCltivC0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNODRCNi5UGm_mHemtl6f1nuzWui6TT4zbiXFcb=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMMaSViZFdd7ZVclDvgCQ8jZiQdxPC1PHYqFUt9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNcpL5bZDCBJFByU594X_9FX52vXJgftQEQK8NB=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMv8dRNRhIw7ydrSOe9-Xx5BhvE-u8Lg0A9gbYq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures><resp>{'time': 1534969287260, 'text': 'Dear Dustin Michie, Thank your you candid review regarding your most recent stay!

I am so glad I decided to stay at Ayres for the 4 nights while visiting family in the South Bay! I was greeted/checked-in by Anaid, who was friendly and professional. I was pleasantly surprised to find out I didn't have to pay $15 parking per day, and she gave us a fun fact sheet about the beautiful pieces throughout the hotel. I especially loved the peace and quiet there. The entire staff were welcoming and the service was excellent! There's a beautiful courtyard area, a pool and jacuzzi (that weren't crowded,) making it easy to enjoy. The room was equipped with free WiFi, fridge and microwave which came in handy, especially since covid, we could bring food back to the room and "social distance" instead of eating at a restaurant. Overall the hotel gets a high score from me and I will definitely return when in Los Angeles!< /text>

The room was excellent, as was the overall "vibe of the hotel. The one minor quibble I'd offer is that the restaurant--which feels like a very nice high-end establishment--is not up to the obvious high standards of the hotel.

In particular, the quality of the breakfast experience was not what I would have expected. On Friday morning, when my two companions and I sat down in a nearly empty restaurant, the service was quite, shall we say, leisurely. We had to ask for coffee, and when my eggs arrived, they were overcooked and my order was not correct. Speaking as someone who has owned restaurants in the past, I know that properly cooking a breakfast order--especially eggs--requires a certain skill and finess. The eggs were over-cooked at too high a temperature so that the edges were browned. They were edible, but not of the quality I would have expected. I received one slice of lightly toasted dry sourdough (butter was in wrapped packets on the table) and no jelly.

The orders for the three of us arrived at the table at different times. This was similar to our service experience at dinner the night before--we all had the same entree, but they arrived at different times.

None of of these are deal-killers, but the rest of your establishment is so nice that I would have expected food service to be at the same level of quality.

<text>Our stay was perfection!!  Thank you Lori Higgins for paying attention to such detail, and being so very considerate for Derrick and I's 24th Wedding Anniversary at your hotel. We love the Ayres, and always arrange for our out of town clients to stay there, but rarely make time for our ourselves to get away. From the Exec King Suite room, to the bottle of champagne with wine glasses & chocolates, and the beautifully handwritten card, we paid attention to every detail. Thank you so much for providing a beautiful atmosphere (even in the midst of a pandemic), that we will cherish always! We love the Ayres, Manhattan Beach!!</text>< pictures>

<Text>What a lovely hotel!  It was our first time out and we were pleased with all of the health wellness measures in place.  We were disappointed that that neither the lounge nor restaurant were open and we were not made aware of that fact during the reservation process.  There was also furniture missing from our suite that was included in the room's description --which made our stay less comfortable.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

<rating>2<//rating><Text>Will not go to this hotel and wont recommend to anyone. We checked in 6/11 to 6/12 room 349. The parking was too much hassle with additional parking fee. The room was not clean at all. The sheets were not fresh. The blankets were severely discolored and stained. The room was too noisy.  The building is few feet from freeway so we could see and hear each car passing by.</Text>< pictures>

I made my reservation just one day before arrival. I appreciated the fact that  the central res team I spoke with was based in FL and the agent spoke English. The agent was excellent to work with. When I arrived on site, Natale at the front desk remembered me from my April stay and was very welcoming.. I have been staying at this property since 2008.  I loved my room ( 372) and the fact I can open the window for fresh air. Parking is easy and the location is great. This was my 3rd stay in 2019. I ordered room service breakfast and it was delivered  hot and timely. I called the hotel after I checked out, I think i forgot my bathing suit in the room. any help you can provide is appreciated. Thank you.</Text>

I was very impressed with the beautiful decor, it was the most beautiful that I had ever seen at a hotel. I loved and was very impressed in your energy saving ways in utilizing the entry card to save energy, specifically the lighting and heating access. Your front desk staff were professional in attire and accommodating. Check-in and out was seamless. My only concern was the air conditioning temperature in the conference room. Based on the number of people (less than 100), it was extremely cold and made it somewhat difficult, to stay focused at times, on the speakers. Fortunately, Lisa Marie Plaske’s team was able to provide “wraps” for some of us to use. Other than that, it was such a wonderful experience that I look forward to bringing my husband and staying at your hotel for next year’s conference.</Review>

<Review>Beautiful Hotel with very comfortable atmosphere. Room was very large and clean. Staff Was very attentive and accommodating. considering the conditions at this time with the Coronavirus going on I did not get to experience all this hotel has to offer as there was no breakfast nor was the restaraunt open among other amenities. I will definitely be looking at this hotel on my next trip to Los Angeles.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

<name>REGINA T< /name><Date>1556837521080< /Date><Rate>4< /Rate><review>If you are in Los Angeles and want to do the beach circuit, stay at the Ayres Hotel in Manhattan Beach. It looks much better on the inside than the outside. I hate that they put a gate in the parking area because it's too close to the street and causes congestion. The hotel is conveniently located off the 405 and 10 mins to the beach. Plus, Costco is directly across the street as well as other places to buy food. I've stayed here 6 years ago and the quality and service are still the same.

I would encourage people to sit and enjoy the courtyard and lobby area. It transports you back to old world Europe. The rooms have a microwave, mini fridge and plenty of counter space.

Stayed here one night for my birthday. Will come back again because it's like 10 mins from LAX. Loved the convenience.</review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM2_qcK6rm7i-GKxCctYYTGmvUK5pTGSmGJdPFR=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNckWfntk1WnfY_GyhcKO06dFHD84a-Gt2k0XE-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMhHzC3r2gJMVWYWMcdMdvEatS6rX8kl8oEfBkR=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNBn5GvFaa7nj3UOACJS6y0znzbkv0giKfkXIQS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures><response>None< /response>< gmap_id>

Beds are pretty worn out. One of my coworkers said it is like sleeping in a hammock. Stayed in several different rooms over the last couple of years as this is the hotel my company provides while we are in the area. Clean hotel just needs a refresh on the mattresses.<//review>

I have just one complaint.  On Sunday morning the floor was being cleaned/polished and was so loud it was difficult to hear the speaker.  Our leader spoke to the worker who basically ignored her and said it had to be done.   I have stayed there maybe a half dozen times and that is the first negative experience I have had...and hopefully the last.</Review><rating>5<//rating>< Pictures>

<Rating>5<//Rating><review>What a beautiful place!  As you enter the Ayres Manhattan Beach Hotel, you see this grand, sweeping imperial staircase in the lobby.  The decor has a wonderful Old World European flair – a large tapestry behind the lobby desk, high ceilings, handcrafted dark wood furniture, beautiful paintings and an inviting fireplace.
When I checked in, I was greeted by a friendly clerk. She explained the dual use of the card key: one, for room entry and two, a means to turn on the lights.  As I walked down the hall to my room, I was impressed by the historical framed photographs of Frank Ayres and the early days of land development in Los Angeles.  My room was quite spacious, beautifully furnished and quite comfortable.
Breakfast at the Matisse restaurant in the hotel is reasonably priced and quite good. Like the hotel, the restaurant reminds you of a European restaurant – beautiful paintings, white tablecloths and peaceful atmosphere.
I do recommend the Ayres Hotel as a great place to stay.  The atmosphere is one of warmth, elegance and comfort.  For me it was such a pleasant change from the more modern furnished hotels I’ve stayed in.</review>< Pictures>

Overall my experience was ok. Gave 3  stars due to so many amenities not available which is not noted on the website when booking the room. No house keeping, fitness center closed, restaurant closed and was not comfortable using the WiFi because it said it was unsecured so I could not watch movies or do any work on my laptop. And the toilet tissue is too rough. The price should have been half off since I got less than half the service. Other than these issues the hotel is nice and I would stay again if the price matches the available amenities.< /Review>

<Text>This place is great! Spacious, quiet, comfortable, excellent service.  Very easy to relax here.

Big atrium with a pool- nice area to sit and have a drink, chat or read. They also have a library. The lobby has a fireplace, which was nice to come into shaking off the evening chill. High ceilings, beds are good, it’s just nice to be in a hotel room where you don’t feel cramped or crammed in.

Plenty of parking and easy on/off the 405. Plenty of food options in area  but the hotel restaurant has an EXCELLENT Happy Hour- I rec the bruschetta and sliders and margaritas.

It has a Mediterranean theme-which is different.

Exceptional customer service- attentive front desk personnel.

Glad I stayed here.</Text><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

<text>Everything was so clean and inviting.

The bed was comfortable and I really enjoyed staying here.

I liked the location as well. It was a plus having everything nearby so we didn’t have to drive around. We even caught a Lyft to the Forum.

The staff was very polite (both the hotel and restaurant).

I would definitely return here and/or to any other Ayres hotel.</text><userid>112879876062153369243<//userid></record>

<pics>None< /pics><Review>Giving this place five stars would be a slam dunk, if it weren't for one detail... The mattress. I recommend steering clear of this property at whatever cost (until they get it resolved). <br/>Every other detail of this property is off-the-charts amazing! The ambiance, staff, everything... <br/>I literally never have pain in my body. Now, four days later, I still have lower back pain. My wife has neck and back pain.<br/>I didn't want to share this publicly because I brought the issue up to management and figured they'd replace the mattress. (Note: my daughters' mattress - same manufacture date, same model - was fine. Maybe we just got a "lemon.")<br/>They just called and said they had done a "quality assurance" review on the mattress and it passed. It will not be replaced. I wouldn't sleep on that mattress again if someone paid me $1000. :-)<br/>As an aside, I called the corporate office in Costa Mesa. They said the all the mattresses at this property are old.<br/>Anyway, hopefully this feedback helps. <br/>If I hear from them that they've at least gotten rid of the mattress we slept on, I'll try to put an update on here.</Review>< Gmap_id>

This is my 8th stay in a year's time and I'm never disappointed. Even amidst a crisis I can find an escape here. The customer service continues to be superb. My room is relaxing, bed comfortable and as always my surroundings feel safe.

Kudos!

My only regret is that I can't feast in the restaurant because the ambiance is breathtaking. I'm still grateful the kitchen isn't completely closed so I can still enjoy the cuisine.

Thank you again for such wonderful hospitality.

Best Always,
😁<//Review>

I went to the Ayers to celebrate my anniversary with a short staycation and one of the executive suites unfortunately due to COVID-19 the restaurant was not open and there was not a bell men available. Aside from that the hotel is still beautiful the rooms are still beautiful the Staff is friendly and the bed was very comfortable.</text>

<Text>Left today after a week of staying for covid exposure. (Was covid neg yay). They had rules already set for us, made evident on the day of arrival. All front desk and housekeeping wearing masks appropriately. It was nice knowing Ayres Hotel supports front line workers who have family at home they want to protect. I was able to get a hotel the day I found out about the exposure, which is superb service! There is a refrigerator and microwave so I brought all my food for the week and stayed in my room. Going to common areas is forbidden, for obvious reasons (though the lobby and outside courtyard are sooo elegant and cute). All you have to do at the end of your stay is collect all your dirty linens and throw it into a large trashbag and another trashbag for throwing out all your trash. Best way to keep housekeeping from getting exposed. Very very happy with my stay. Will come back after covid is over.</Text>< Pictures>

We spend two nights at this location and it was very enjoyable.  The decor is very European.  The building is clean, updated and has a very nice pool with cool seating outside, (which I did not use, just an observation).  The receptionist was quick at check-in and very informative.

You have to use your room keys to turn on the lights, which is an energy saving feature.  What a great way to save on energy.

The location what great for us, next to 405 freeway with Costco has right next door.  There's a Porsche dealer next door as well if you want to upgrade your ride 😉.

Overall, we enjoyed our stay and I highly recommend it.  Our weekend plans changed and we ended up doing Disneyland.  The commute was about 20 minutes, but because we left early and arrived late, no traffic was really encountered.<//Text>

Unlike a chain hotel, this feels more like having a room in an old mansion and everyone is waiting to gather in the parlor to play a murder mystery game. The lobby is cozy with its fireplace that feels so good when it's cold outside. Only negative is the difficulty in finding one's way to the elevator after leaving the room to go downstairs. The signage can be confusing as all four hallways look alike. Going in circles trying to find the elevator is frustrating. It happens every time I stay here.< /text>

It tries to be fancy, but it's just a normal hotel with a weird aesthetic and some very poorly designed features.

They have a power saving thing that you're supposed to put your room card into to turn on all the lights. The person I was staying with took his with him while I was in the shower... leaving me in total darkness. There's also omnipresent "classical" music playing on the first floor.

They also require you to use your room card to enter and exit the parking lot. The readers are poorly placed and usually require you to get out of your car. The entrances are on a busy street, so it's dangerous. Ever heard of parking passes and a towing service? I guess this place hasn't.<//review>

You also have a wonderful restaurant downstairs with good food.  It was well prepared and well served. I highly recommend this place to consider if you are in LA.

I found the Ayres Hotel to be a warm and inviting space. I arrived quite early in the morning for an event being held at the hotel. I stopped at the front desk to check on checking in where they confirmed that it was far too early. However, they were happy to hold my luggage for me. When I checked back just after noon they did have my room ready. Hooray!
I love the old castle feel of the decor. I also loved the spaciousness of my room as well as the fridge and microwave. Great accommodations!<//text>

Access to the hotel during heavy traffic is somewhat tricky. The main entrance on Hindry Avenue is also the access ramp to the I-405 freeway, so it gets combative when trying to turn left across traffic. The secondary entrance is on Rosecrans Avenue, which is heavily congested at times.</review><Pics>None</Pics></record>

The decore is spectacular. The rooms are large, spacious and clean. The staff is helpful and welcoming. We asked for extra ice bags and we immediately received them. There is a Costco directly across the street. I loved everything about this hotel and would definitely recommend it.<//review><response>None< /response>< pictures>

Was going to stay here for a week, checked in at three had dinner at six at the restaurant.  At the restaurant the hostess body shamed me over only wanting my steak and nothing else and my appearance(I will admit street people dress better than I do even though they parked my McLarenfor me). I left the hotel the next morning after being at the hotel for less than 24 hrs explained why I was leaving after being body shamed and that I did not eat the meal because of this. I asked for refund and they are denying a refund.  Obviously if it's a policy issue the have no moral conduct and support actions of shaming individuals.  I would and will not stay at any of their hotels again< /text>

Oh yes, close to stores and many unique restaurants. They also provide a free shuttle to Manhattan Beach. Will definitely return< /text>< rating>

Its Always a pleasure to stay at this Beautiful Hotel! Its my "Home away from home" The Maltese Restaurant inside is Amazing! Great Food and Excellent Service. Shared a late business lunch with a friend. She loved the atmosphere as well and is planning to return for a stay with her Husband. I share my experiences with all of my friends and family. While traveling and performing, Its a place for me to rest and relax! To the Staff, You are all Amazing! Thank you.

<rate>4</rate><Text>Room was great for sharing, I was there for a sewing retreat, so sharing with someone I did not know before the weekend, and the divider etc made for comfortable sharing.  All meals were fantastic, and the wait staff were wonderful. The courtyard is a lovely space to go for some quiet and head clearing. Only one complaint: Shampoo/conditioner two in one mix is not great, would prefer separate bottles .
Also in a shared room, you need more soaps for the shower and basin.<//Text>< Pics>

The hotel didn't offer anything to make it slightly special in anyway.  There was no bottled water in the room.  Even if they want to charge for it, at least have it in the room for the guest to readily make a cup of coffee or just to have some water.  Instead, we were told (on the phone) that a convenient store is across the parking lot and the Vending Machine Room is available (for us to walk around looking for it).  For $250 (room/parking), I expected slightly better than a Western or Comfort Inn and such.  The hotel was clean, staff was friendly, and that's appreciated.<//Text>

All the staff were extremely friendly and helpful.  The rooms were large, comfortable and clean. I was there for a high school reunion and the patio offered a great venue for a meet and greet.  The food at the main event was good and the room was large enough for 150+ of us, plus a dance floor.  The decor of the hotel was very pleasing and parking was free.< /Text>

<Text>Beautiful Hotel. Would get a 5 star rating easily based on rooms, pool and Matisse, the on-site restaurant but the parking and failed key cards were off putting.

<Text>The staff was really nice and answered all of my silly questions. I didn’t know the 2 queen beds room was going to have a  divider between the beds which was a SUPER plus, it seemed like I had my own side of room and my daughter hers. I LOVED the hardwood floors, WAY better than carpet. However, what really drew my attention was the light saver energy. I don’t think no other hotel has that, well, from what I’ve been at.</Text>< Pictures>

This is a wonderful hotel! Great location—close to LAX, shopping and restaurants. Very helpful staff—front desk, restaurant and room attendants. And the rooms are gorgeous and well appointed. The area with the refrigerator and microwave is really nice with a K-cup coffee maker. It was an ideal place for the 3 day seminar I attended at the hotel. My only regret- that I did not get a chance to soak in the whirlpool!</review>

< Review>
This place is probably ome of the worst I have stayed at when it comes to customer service.  To start the $15 parking fee is nothing but a cash grab.  I have stayed in hotels in major cities where parking is a premium or the garage is shared and the parking fee makes sense.  But when a property is in the outskirts, has a massive parking lot and is adjoined by a mall parking lot with THOUSANDS of spots...the fee is just that... a cash grab.   As pretty as the hotel is, they couldn't spend the extra few dollars on a control system that allows the lights to be illuminated upon entry or by occupancy.  Sonyou have to leave a key in a slot for thenlights to even work and then naturally you leave it in the room causing an inconvenience.  Asking firba late check out was apparently a tall order as i was told to call in the morning and ask when we needed to plan out our day the night before.  So as I said...not customer focused and therefore reaps a poor review.  We will not return.< /Review>

<text>If you're looking for a higher end hotel with charm, the Ayres is it. It's a luxurious hotel with a Victorian atmosphere that's very unique. The rooms are quite spacious, and the food is great.

<Review>Classy and clean hotel. Hotel staff, especially Mr. Rahman at the front desk, were super helpful and courteous. The bathroom was a bit small but the suite itself was huge. Room furniture was so elegant and European. Room was very clean. Convenient location, also close to the beach. Will book again if I return to LA.</Review><time>1548278965787</time>< rate>

<rating>4</rating><Text>Recently stayed at Ayers as we flew in for a friends wedding. We ended up booking Ayers because it was in a central location from the wedding and some of the sights we planned to visit while in LA.

The Hotel was quaint and very clean. Checking in was a breeze and our room was quite spacious. The property had substantial parking which can be accessed with your room key. Sometimes the card reader to enter the parking area can be a little temperamental but this is only a minor inconvenience.

The surrounding areas don’t offer much in the way of “sights” but are plentiful with shopping and food. Check out Noah’s Bagels which is only a short drive from the hotel and great for a quick breakfast.</Text><date>1538068431847</date>< user>

<Rating>4</Rating><Review>Beautiful hotel with a European feel.  Desk staff were congenial, helpful and professional.  Restaurant food was good.  Room was very comfortable.  Only issue that caused me to grade it a 4 vs. 5 was our room was located where we heard freeway noise.  Not loud but you could hear it.  A little more attention needs to be given to maid services cleaning room and replacing used face cloths and towels.  We had to request them since there were none left after our first night and we purposely put the used cloths in the tub.  To be fair though, when we asked, our maid was more than happy to supply us with what we needed.  We just had to search her out.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1504106706029, 'text': 'Dear Peggy Oullet, Thank you for taking the time to provide us with a review and star rating.

Loved it!

Beautiful. Great location, big rooms and beds.

I called ahead to assure there were sheets and pillows for the pull out bed and when we arrived it was made up and ready for us.

Housekeeping was a little noisy in the morning and there were bugs by the trash outside the back entrance door.

Everything else was perfect, lovely and the staff was great and provided excellent customer service.</review>

<text>Our stay at Ayres Hotel - Manhattan Beach was very enjoyable, albeit, a little too short.  The decor is beautiful, the rooms are grand, and the location is good. We also liked the fitness room.  What did we not like as much? Is it necessary to have paid parking? The gates were a little too much.  Although breakfast was not included, I would have at least liked a coffee/tea bar in the lobby - with a newspaper.  Overall a great stay.< /text><gmap_id>0x80c2b417a15779c7:0xd18227ecdffd65aa</gmap_id><pictures>None</pictures><userid>116643665502902269865<//userid>< Resp>

The only issue we had was with your email messaging site. Every time I emailed someone, I received a completely different answer than when I called and/or spoke to someone in person at the hotel.
I understand that those emails come from a central hub but if I believed everything that was emailed to me I would have never stayed at your hotel.< /Text>< pics>

Great hotel! It is always clean, comfortable and quiet which is important to me. The location is close to LAX which is convenient. Classic decor and historic Los Angeles photographs are a throwback to "old" LA. Very cool! Staff is friendly and attentive. Highly recommend this hotel</Text>

When my cousin and I open the door to our room our breath was taken away.  It was beautiful. We felt and slept like princesses in our matching beds. The next morning we ate a lovely breakfast in the restaurant. All in all a great way to end a long weekend.<//Review><pictures>None</pictures><response>None<//response>< gmapID>

This is the very best place to stay when in LA, for a number of reasons.

1. Very close proximity to the airport, without the noise.
2.THE best and most comfy pillows and beds I've found in a hotel.
3. Beautiful surroundings. Makes one feel like you're living in a castle!
4. The restaurant attached to the hotel is excellent both in service and food. You don't need to drive in traffic to get a great dining experience.
5. Rooms are lovely, quiet, and equipped with a refrigerator and nice, separate, bathroom area.

In all, an excellent experience and the only place I'll stay when traveling to LA on business or pleasure.
Thank you!

<Text>This is a wonderful gem of a hotel very convenient to LAX. Nice bar/restaurant with an unbeatable atmosphere. Hotel lobby makes you feel like you are in a cottage filled with wonderful antique furniture and comfortable seating. Artwork throughout, pool in center of hotel, great place for a wedding! Jersey Mikes sandwich shop is right nextdoor and I recommend it! And Starbucks is in that same strip mall.<//Text>< username>

I would have rated this a 5 except for the following: I gave the wrong chamber maid a relatively decent tip and had to have this corrected. The shower took a bit long for hot water. Also, extra tissues were not left. The front desk and the restaurant staff were terrific expecially Ruby and Joceline.

The hotel itself is beyond a 5. It is most elegant and charming. The old European look created in a new hotel made it extra beautiful. What a lovely place to stay!<//review>

Nice hotel in the Manhattan Beach area. I understand that it's supposed to be themed as European boutique but it mostly just feels outdated. The beds and baths could definitely use an upgrade. They're comfortable enough but comparative to the other hotels in the same price range I wasn't impressed. However the staff is very helpful and friendly and everything is really clean. There's also a restaurant/bar in house and it is close to numerous restaurants and shopping centers.<//Review>

The standard was high on every level, cleanliness, efficiency, staff, food, amenities etc.  I felt cared for and cared about.  It was conveniently situated near to the airport, and to beautiful beaches as well.  The decor is stunning, from the furniture to the linens, artwork, and architecture.  It is maintained to the highest of standards. I would not hesitate to stay again.  In fact, I will start planning now!< /Review>< pictures>

One of the features I enjoyed the most was how great the AC unit worked. I enjoy a cold room and by far this has been the best experience for me.

<Review>The hotel is a beautiful property located conveniently close to the freeway.  Room was nicely appointed with a good bed and very high ceilings giving a feeling of spaciousness.  The hotel lacks the included breakfast and free happy hour that some of the Ayres properties offer, which is unfortunate, but there is an on-site restaurant.  I enjoyed a cocktail and tasty snack at the bar upon arrival, reasonably priced, served by a pleasant bartender.  The modest charge for parking is understandable given the location, however the equipment needs some repair - the Hindry Avenue gate to the northern parking lot would never open with the use of the parking pass, and it was necessary to pull a ticket each time to get in.  More importantly, the parking pass worked fine to actuate the gate when exiting the property, so it wasn't really a big deal..< /Review></record>

Giving this place 5 🌟 may be stretching it a bit...but I do love this hotel. I love everything about it. The look,  the feel,  the ambiance. The staff... Not so friendly.  We checked in late last night and the front desk person was very short,  not friendly,  and not accommodating. When I called in earlier to let them know we were checking in late, the girl was really nice, and so was our evening bartender.  This is why I still give the 5 🌟 rating.</Text>

Surprisingly nice boutique hotel on the inside. Room, lobby, halls and sitting rooms were furnished beautifully. Bed was comfortable and room was very large which I appreciated as we have 2 children. The service was excellent and everyone who worked there was great. Loved all the paintings in the hotel and the courtyard.< /Text>

<time>1547443980255<//time><rate>5<//rate><text>This gem is frequented by locals and airline crews. It's it right next to the 405 freeway and can be a little tricky to get into but once you do get in it's easy there on out. The property is gorgeous. The decor is romantic Italian luxury featuring marble floors, crystal chandeliers, a grand wrap staircase, lovely sculptures and magohogony armoires and furnishings. Perfect for a wedding. The hotel is surrounded by restaurants and shopping within walking distance. There is a small swimming pool and iron tables and chairs on the outside patio in the center of the hotel. The rooms are very large with many amenities. The whole place is clean and reasonably priced. The staff is professional, and quick to get the job done. We hosted an event in the Florentine room and had our staff stay at the hotel and look forward to doing so again next year.</text>< pictures>

<Review>My family stayed at the Ayres Manhattan Beach for a couple nights on our vacation to California.  Not being from California, we weren't familiar with the Ayres Hotels.  The reviews we had read looked very promising.  We weren't disappointed.  This is a beautiful hotel with more than helpful staff.  Thank you for adding to our great trip to California!</Review>< pictures>

I had a lovely stay here! The rooms are cozy with extremely comfortable mattresses (very important!) and everything was clean and tidy.

The grand foyer is exatly that... GRAND. It has a majestic staircase that is the perfect backdrop for photo opportunities. There is carefully curated artwork all throughout the hotel and the interior architectural details are noteworthy as well.

Every staff member was extremely pleasant and oh!! - the onsite restaurant was absolutely delicious! I thoroughly enjoyed my stay! It's minutes from the beach and has lots of shopping and dining nearby and is close to major highways as well. I reccomend!<//review>

Attended a retirement party at this location. The ambiance was classic yet modern, the waterfalls in the meeting area was calming yet festive. The hall where we ate and danced was spacious and allowed us to communicate, walk around and have a good time. The food was excellent and the entire experience was enjoyable. The next time I need to stay in Manhattan Beach this will be my hotel.</review>

Sorry David, Mr. General Manager, but THATS NOT HOW YOU DO IT.

----edit-----02/2020
I had not noticed that Dave reach back to me over this incident. That shows a lot of respect and I accept the gesture. At the time I was only calling see if I can come in and pick up an application that's all. However I lifted up the 1 star to 4 because I have stayed here twice and enjoyed both times.

<Review>Hotel is nicely decorated. Paintings on walls, beautiful furniture. Lobby is beautiful. Staff is welcoming. Hotelrooms are decorated with paintings and beautiful furniture too. Very quiet in hotel rooms and also on the patio. Birds and trees there. Would recommend this hotel when you would like to stay close to LAX (only 12 minutes drive to car rental spots) but do not want to stay too close to the airport.</Review><gmap_id>0x80c2b417a15779c7:0xd18227ecdffd65aa</gmap_id><date>1533036660940<//date>< userid>

Hotel and room were really well presented. I dealt with two different reception staff, one was great and the other was 'ok'. The restaurant (breakfast) was amazing and the staff there were very friendly. The food was great value for money.

I would stay here again for sure, it's a really nice hotel for the price.< /review>

The hotel was old fashioned but full of nostalgia. Our room was small but exactly what we had expected. Shared bathrooms and showers was frustrating at times but we knew this before hand.  Beds were older and squeaked a lot, not conducive to a honeymoon stay, and the pillows were incredibly thin. Location was great! Walking distance to coir tower, fisherman wharf, Ghibelline square, little Italy and Hawthorne, CA . For the price and location it was a great deal.</text>

The Ayres Manhattan Beach was a very nice looking hotel. The entryway and lobby are tastefully decorated in Victorian style. You'll want to take pictures. Although Victorian is their theme, the hotel could stand some modernization. The appliances and TV are dated, and the shower has an incredibly impractical shower head that ends up getting the bathroom floor wet. That being said, the staff are friendly, and the pool is nice, if a bit small. Beautiful chandeliers on the interior along beautiful banquet rooms make me feel this would be a great wedding venue. In our particular room the sink countertop was clearly broken at some point and poorly put back together, but fully functional. The windows don't have full privacy, because only the slightly transparent curtains pull fully shut. The lot behind our room was private with thick hedges, but fully closing curtains would still be nice. Parking is easy and only $10/night, which is a steal for the area. Rooms were very spacious, clean, and the furniture was high quality. The mattress was super comfortable. It was also very quiet; no noise could be heard in the hallway or other rooms. All-in-all, it's a nice hotel that needs a few updates to be truly great, but for the price, I feel it was a good value.</Review>

Every one of your team members I have the pleasure to interact with; the housekeeping staff, the maintenance men, the restaurant staff, and especially the front desk staff, when I am at your hotel has been unfailingly professional, courteous, very pleasant, and accommodating whenever possible.

They shuttle to the beach, the restaurant on site was good for all meals (we went a few times during our stay), and the rooms were gorgeous!  We arrived very early, and even though we were supposed to check in at 3 they let us check in at 11:30 when they had a room available.  After waking up at 3am Pacific time, that was very much appreciated.  At the end of our stay, we left our electronics bag there when leaving for the airport, and they had it packaged up and sent to us very quickly.  Nothing like leaving in an Uber at 4:30 am only to realize your tablet, keyboard, mouse, and countless charger cables were all left in the hotel lobby.  It was a huge relief when they found it, and let us know it was no problem to mail it to us.  Lori helped us through it all, along with others on staff.  All were very professional and helpful.  When I come back to LA, I'm staying with Ayres.<//text>< username>

<Date>1461886853666< /Date><text>I would've rated your hotel 5 had my breakfast experience at Matisse been more enjoyable and satisfying.  I found service to be sloppy and unfriendly.  My guest was served a cup of tea, but there was no spoon accompanying it.  My bowl of oatmeal came without sugar or milk.

Additionally, the server (Fabian) was totally lackluster and lacking professionalism.  After taking my order, Fabian rudely pointed his finger to my guest for their order instead of verbally asking for it.  He walked around the dining room as if he was just waking up.

At the time, there were only two tables being waited on.  The dining room was not busy at all.

I don't wish for any disciplinary action to be taken, but only that the servers be counseled on being more attentive and courteous.<//text>< user_id>

<Text>This visit was the 3rd room I have stayed in at the Ayres Hotel Hawthorne.  I've had 2 rooms of my own and then I also shared a room with a friend for another conference.  Your hotel is always a wonderful experience, from beginning to end.  The entire staff (concierge desk, restaurant staff, housekeeping personnel, etc) far exceed all expectations for polite, friendly and respectful service.  There is NOTHING left to chance here at the Ayres/Hawthorne.  I would highly recommend the Ayres/Hawthorne to anyone for a personal trip, business trip or special event venue.  Everywhere you look around the hotel, you have created a delight to your guests' senses.  It is exquisite, yet casually comfortable, with the evening-lit inner courtyard, the expansive upper level balcony, the lobby fireplace that is tall enough to stand in, the curved iron staircase that leads to the second level, the peaceful and beautiful library room, which is one of my favorite places at Hawthorne. I look forward to another stay with you for our next conference in the Spring.

<review>The hotel was decorated with care. When we checked in I was informed of the $10 a day parking fee. This was a deficit, as I was never told about this fee. When I told the person at check in she said, “Oh, sorry.” Nothing more. The rest of the stay was pretty satisfying.
Positives: Bed was soft, pillows were comfy, staff was accommodating (although visibly on cell phones, while at the front)
Negatives: coffee table and round table made the suite feel cluttered, room was noisy both nights until 11pm because of a reception below, drinks were fairly expensive for the caliber of hotel</review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

The hotel is beautiful. Front desk staff  did  their job, but, they weren't friendly.  As they are the first people to greet the hotel guests, they need to smile and make the guests feel welcomed.  Rooms were very clean and beds comfortable.  The restaurant was fantastic.  Food and presententation were outstanding.  Pricing is comparable to other hotel restaurants in the area.</Review>

overall is good - rooms are big and clean, the garden is beautiful and the chateau is generally well kept, but would love better lighting in the bathroom area. It's a simple improvement but makes the entire experience much better as white fluorescent lighting just doesn't make people comfortable. The rooms also don't smell super fresh like what you would expect at nicer hotels.. probably has to do with the cleaning solutions they use<//Text>

Our room was spacious and very comfortable.   Our flight arrived late, but the hotel had a restaurant that was opened late with a diverse menu for accommodating late arrivals who were seeking a late dinner.  Overall, we enjoyed our stay at the hotel.</Review>

The room was so beautiful, we couldn't help but fill our phones with pictures! The service, when needed, was always great. My only suggestion is to include a separate hair conditioner in the toiletries set, rather than simply a "conditioning shampoo" as that really doesn't work for all hair types. I was left wanting for a conditioner.</Text>

The hotel is pretty on the inside and the rooms are pretty, more than adequate with very comfy beds.   The hotel is located next to the 405 freeway and thus can be noisy.   Hotel was fine, but nothing special.
They did not offer afternoon tea, welcome fruit or anything.  Dining experience was not good - although different owner than hotel, we expected better quality of food within the hotel< /text>

We loved our stay at this hotel. Staff is superb. The room was clean and so was the bathroom. We each had a queen bed and there was a wall with shutters to open and close for each guests privacy. Centrally located near highway and shopping. Location was very close from the airport and to the church.< /Text>

The man at the front desk wanted me to solve the problem as he kept asking lots of questions, like What kind of heater did it have?  Did it have a thermostat on the wall?  Etc.  Etc.  He did offer to bring up my bags which I appreciated.  When he came in my room, he determined the heater-cooler was not working.  He offered to change my room.  I agreed if he could get me closer to the elevator.  He did but I could not figure out how to get heat in the room, only cool.  So I put on my pajamas and got under the covers.  I did not want to move again.  The last day a nice man working on the wall near the elevator turned the heat on and the room felt wonder-ful for the last hour.<//text>< user>

What a gorgeous hotel!  We loved the central location to LAX, the great restaurants around, even the Matisse was wonderful.  The high ceilings and new furnishings in our room were gorgeous.  The old world European feel was great.< /text>

Rosie at Reception Desk was very helpful.  And it was a pleasant surprise to find a 'goodie' bag in our room in celebration of my special birthday.  Rosie later called our room to assure that everything was in order and there were no problems.
The room was beautiful, bed very comfortable, quiet location.
For any special occasion, this is the best place in the South Bay for a 'regal' stay, without the 'regal' price.</text>

Checked in the hotel at 7 pm left to Universal studios for horror nights came back at 5am and the next day the same person who helped me out at the front desk was their and he asked about my trip to Universal studios which I thought he would've forgotten but he didn't so I was shocked and happy to hear from him again the next day and I will be staying here again for my next visit, defiantly going to recommend this place to friends and family. :) keep up the good work staff and crew at the Ayres Hotel :D</text>

A decent hotel, with mostly large, airy rooms. Windows open, at least a bit. Some top floor rooms are noisy due to mechanical equipment on the roof. Courtyard facing rooms may be noisy if they have an event going on, or if there are noisy kids in the pool. Highway facing rooms are not suitable if you want to have a window open, they are ok with air conditioning on.<//review>

I stay at this hotel every year as part of an annual meeting for my golf association.  Besides being very beautifully furnished and immaculate, the room is very spacious and has always been very clean.  The bed is most comfortable and an absolute joy to relax in.  The bathroom and shower are always clean and there are plenty of clean plush towels.  I look for to staying at this Ayres hotel every year.<//Text>

<Time>1437492896010</Time><Rate>5< /Rate><review>We were surprised, in a good way, at how the Ayres met our needs for an overnight near LAX. It was so much less than other nearby hotels, and it offered a certain serenity that was most welcome on the last day of our trip to Southern California. There is something about a hotel that does NOT offer free breakfast that keeps the sports teams, clubs, and droves away, and although we love kids, we needed a respite. Matisse provided us with a relaxing and very well prepared lunch, and the room facing the courtyard was quiet, clean and comfortable.< /review>< Pictures>

<Review>We came for the Pezcific Gathering in February 2017.  The Hotel is just beautiful and so cozy.  It was a rainy weekend and that made it even more cozy.  I've stayed at several Ayres' Hotels and love them all but your location's interior was simply beautiful.  I especially loved hanging out in the Library.  You would never know that this Hotel is right next to a busy freeway.  The soundproofing was amazing.<//Review>< pictures>

Overall nice hotel however there were personal items in my room from previous guests.  For the amount of money to stay here this is unacceptable.  Housekeeping need to pay attention to detail and make certain that rooms are cleaned and disinfected between guests< /Text>

I went to the restaurant within the hotel with a group of friends to have a quick meeting over happy hour. The host was extremely rude and wouldn't even let us sit in the restaurant which was nearly empty unless everyone ordered something. Even forcing someone to pay for water because they hadn't ordered yet. This situation is understandable, however could have been handled in a much more tactful way. Our group will never be back.</review>

Great hotel, beautiful along with wonderful customer service. I had called front desk on accident trying to reach room service, they were helpful without hesitation.

Only thing I have to say is, front desk didn't know what time the pool had closed.Understandable due to a wedding being held in the evening.  The phones in the room didn't work, I had to call front desk in-order to get extra towels.<//review>

<Text>Beautiful hotel and wonderful service. I had originally wanted a 4th floor room and it was not available. I ended up on the 2nd floor right above a party with loud music that went on till 12am. I had an early wedding event and could not sleep. The staff was very accommodating and changed the room for the night so I can get some sleep. Everyone was very wonderful. The wedding was beautiful. I will be back if I need a room in the area.< /Text>< pics>

I have always enjoyed this hotel chain. Shopping and restaurants in easy walking distance if you don't mind using cross walks on busy roads; McDonalds and COSTCO directly across the street. We commented that it felt like an oasis in the city. There are plenty of shops and food options around this hotel and even a Costco just across the road. My guess is that they just needed a new shower head.<//text>

Was very pleased with the Ayres Manhattan Beach Hotel.  I have never stayed at an Ayres before, but would definitely go back.  I was able to check in early.  The front desk staff answered all my questions and helped me out whenever I needed it.

THIS IS A LONG ONE... BRACE YOURSELVES.
My husband and I decided to celebrate our WEDDING anniversary at the Matisse Restaurant, inside of the Ayres hotel. We had a few family members join us (we did not want to do anything too extravagant) for the evening. Upon arrival, the vibe was a bit callous (RED FLAG #1), however, I did not want to jump to any conclusions regarding my opinion of the place (and it was too late to go anywhere else) so we stayed to try and enjoy our evening. After ordering and eating our food, I found that it was not spectacular (could have been better for the price), but not too bad. The service was so-so (although the waiter was friendly so I am not including him in this bad rating). After being there a couple hours, we were done and gearing up to pay the tab. As we waited for the check, there was one incident where, the host made it her point to single out, speak to, and play with ONE CHILD in particular. While ignoring the other FOUR children who were in attendance. The first time she did it, I did not say anything, but after she came back 3 times to address the same child (the lightest child at the table). I had to bring it to her attention that, the other children even tried to speak to her and she ignored them yet she continues to play with and compliment this ONE. Even after I brought this it to her attention; instead of addressing the other children, she still ignored them and said "Oh... I didn't see them" then she added insult to injury by going back to the mixed-race child and offering him a dessert (and we had a cake!). She did not offer any of the other children anything. That was RED FLAG #2.
Then my niece had to use the restroom so my sister went to ask the front desk clerk (of the hotel) where the restrooms were... the clerk frowned at her and SNARLED "it's over there" while pointing in the distance to a long hall. My sister did not say anything, she just came back into the restaurant to tell me what happened. The Chicano waiter who then informed us where is was. The host then stated "there is no way to find the restroom without someone showing you were to go". I then informed her of how the front-desk clerk behaved and how she basically shooed my sister and niece off and she stated that she would "do something about it". After we finished, everyone moved towards the lobby. As we were leaving, there was a group of teenagers who were coming into the lobby from outside, they were loud and playing around and no one blinked an eye. My 4 year old niece, 10 year old niece and 9 year old nephew were telling jokes and laughing as they waited for everyone to gather in the lobby. The same clerk who snarled at my sister, called security on them. As I walked into the lobby, I saw her roll her eyes, heard her exhale as if she was annoyed, and saw her stare angrily at these CHILDREN as she picked up a two-way radio and called the security (or her manager). The manager came out of the back room and appeared to tell her, he was not going to do anything because they were children and they were not doing anything wrong. At this point, I was appalled and insulted. I went to inform the host (because I was told she was the manager over the hotel/restaurant staff). She informed me that she had nothing to do with the front desk and that she would introduce me to the supervisor and he could handle the complaint. I went to put my things inside of the car and to take the children out of the lobby. Upon my return, I noticed that the angry clerk was ducking off to the back and the supervisor was now tending to the front desk. I asked for the name of the angry clerk and they would not give it to me. I was told that they would "take care of the situation", but I think they did nothing. This is the treatment my family and I received, on my anniversary, after spending a pretty penny with this establishment. I am disappointed and will not be returning to this place. I will also advise anyone not to come here. Save your time, money, and feelings and go some place where they APPRECIATE ALL of their CUSTOMERS.< /text>

I did not find the room to be very good. I was on the first floor, and did not realize until after I had gone to bed that the window was actually a sliding glass door, and also that the door was unlocked! I felt very uncomfortable with that, thinking that someone could have easily walked in. Next, the bath towels all had other people's hairs in them. All three of my towels! It was clear they had been washed, dried and folded, but the hairs were all intertwined in the towels. And it was clearly not just one person's hair but multiple, different people. It was just unappealing. Finally, the doors/walls were very thin and a lot of sound came from the bathroom area. It made me feel like someone was possibly in the room (given that the sliding door was unlocked for a few hours before I noticed it was a door!) Needless to say, I think I only got 1 hour of sleep. I was not pleased.</review>

<text>The room could be very nice, but it wasn't cleaned well. The bath mat had footprints on it and there were toothpaste spots and tons of dust on the back splash behind the sink. The water in the shower took forever to get warm. The clerk who checked me in ignored me for a few minutes, then when he finally asked if I needed help he seemed annoyed that he had to help me. The morning staff didn't really seem bothered when I reported the dirty bath mat and sink at checkout.
The other hotels I've stayed at in this chain have been wonderful, so please don't write off the whole chain, but I will look into other options when staying in this area in the future.</text></record></dataset><record>

I work as a manager in a 4star hotel in downtown Vancouver in Canada. I'm very satisfied with Ayers Manhattan Beach hotel. Overall, it is a very nice and clean hotel. Location is perfect! Lots of parking spaces are available. It's very easy to get in and out. Staff are friendly. We will recommend your hotel to our friends and family.< /Text>

In September 2015 I traveled to California with my mother and younger brother. Good location with a couple of chain restaurants within a short walking distance. We were having such a good time we really did not get to use any of the amenities at the hotel. We were tired and looked like a mess but the staff greeted us so friendly and amiable.<//Text>

It's my first time staying at the Ayres Hotel. I was given a room on the first floor which turns out it pretty cool. The ceilings in the room are 18 feet high with hanging lights. I was very impressed with the decor and ambiance. The price is very competitive and I think is a great value for the room. Doesn't have a continental breakfast, but it does have a nice restaurant and bar. The pool area and courtyard are also very nice. The convenient location to LAX made it very desirable for me. Check-in was a breeze and house keeping has kept my room in perfect order. I would definitely stay here again! Food and shopping is also within walking distance. If you want more options, just catch an Uber or Lyft to just about anything you can think of near by.< /text>

<Text>Staff was great, Room was very clean and quite, window opened for nice fresh air and although it was next to freeway I never hear a sound. Best of all I never left the place the food was so good!
PS. I love the comfort and sitting angle of the dinning chairs.(almost feel asleep.)

My husband and I were pleased with our stay. Our King size deluxe suite was very roomy and relaxing. The only thing that I would of liked is a full view mirror. There was only a mirror by the bathroom which was too high for me to get a full body view.</text>

We stayed here because we were going to a concert at the Forum.  The hotel was very nice and much more than we expected for the area.  The rooms were nice and beds comfy.  The ambiance was great!  Staff was very friendly and we enjoy the outdoor verandas over looking the pool area.  Would definitely recommend this hotel as one of the nicest places to stay close to the Forum.  Lots of good restaurants in the area.  We had dinner at Flemmings that was right down the street.<//Text>

<review>What a wonderful time and what a wonderful hotel! I was impressed with the architecture, the art and decorations, the size and comfort of the rooms, the fitness room, the patio. But what really stood out to me was the staff. Everyone was extraordinarily kind, friendly, helpful, accomodating. It's rare to have great customer service/customer care anywhere, and this hotel's staff knocked it out of the park. Even the maintenance man was friendly (we didn't have any issues, I just met him in the elevator). I highly recommend this hotel!< /review><pics>None</pics><Response>None<//Response>< Gmap_id>

<Text>I've driven by this place twice a day for nearly 18 months and finally went inside for lunch. Based on the location, I always assumed that this was a glorified Motel 6. Boy was I wrong!

Inside, the hotel looks like an Italian villa complete with tapestries, elaborate paintings and floor tiles. The food in the restaurant was superb (albeit hotel prices). If you need to stay in the South Bay for business, this appears to be a fantastic option.

Star deduction because the parking rates are ridiculous. Park across the street at Costco instead.<//Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

Staff is very polite both at the desk and in the restaurant. Rooms are clean and well maintained. However, ice machines don't all work. Biggest annoyance is the parking gate which takes some creative driving to get close enough to swipe your key without getting out of your car.</review>

<Text>I held my Bridal Tea in the Dining Room, reserved two suites for the Bridal Party and Groom's Party to get ready the day of the wedding and took pre-wedding pictures in the lobby.  My experience was beyond my expectations.  For example, the staff was so attentive to my needs for the Bridal Tea that when I asked if they had a cake stand I could use, one of the servers brought her own personal stand from home!  The managers on duty were also super helpful.  What a hidden gem in Los Angeles--I hope other brides and grooms find out about this fabulous hotel-If I could give it 10 stars on this review, I would!< /Text><gmapID>0x80c2b417a15779c7:0xd18227ecdffd65aa<//gmapID><rating>5< /rating></record></dataset><record>

everything was fine but 24 hours before checkout, last day, I could not get into my room. I had to go to front desk twice to get new cards.  Then parking gate malfunctioned. Other than that it was ok.<//Text>

<rate>4<//rate><Review>Beautiful hotel, very stately and wonderful to admire. However not enough signage for its slightly labyrinth like interior (you'll get lost a few times inside before you figure out which way to go) and if there's anyone above you.. you will hear them through the ceilings walking or showering.< /Review></record>

Didn't deal to much with service, but the decorations and aesthetic of this place is amazing. You feel like you're in an old Victorian place I dont know if the stuff is authentic, hut it sure looks it. Then you walk out to see a bed bath and beyond, it's so wild. Price wasnt bad either.< /text>

The staffs are very polite, the appearance of the hotel is very soothing, and relaxing. I have stayed at this site several times and enjoyed my stay each time.
The parking gate could use some attention as the room keys to open the gate does not always work.</review>

This was my first stay at the Ayers Hotel in Hawthorne / Manhattan Beach.  I was treated with respect and our whole visit was wonderful.  We stayed here as my high school reunion was being hosted there.  The room, service, food and staff made the visit worthy of coming back when in town again.<//review>

Great hotel. We used to stay at another hotel when visiting UCLA hospital, but for the same price we have more of a 5 star quality experience than any other hotel in the area. Thanks for the great customer service.</review>

The hotel is beautifully decorated, especially the interior courtyard filled with trees. The staff was helpful, and their ballroom dinner service was fairly timely given the circumstances. The rooms are nice, but could use updated lighting features.</Review>

Love the hotel, the rooms, the dining, the location.
Not wild about the change to the parking.  Hadn't been to hotel in over a year so it was a bit of a surprise.  Had a hard time getting my room key read and the first time entering the site I didn't know what to do.  I'll know better next trip.
I'll be back.</review>

The room was always clean and the decor of the hotel makes you feel as if living in a castle. The grounds of the hotel made you feel llike you were in Europe and the decor was classy. Not actually in ***hattan Beach but a very short drive to the beach. Friendly staff Upon check in there were no luggage carts available.</Text>

Beyond that, my bed was comfortable, my room was clean, the food was delicious, and the staff was very courteous.

Your hotel is lovely inside. We had some issues with the parking arm and not being able to get into the parking lot. We also had several meals in the restaurant and I was extremely disappointed. Service was POOR. There was only one person working at providing service while a woman in dress cloths walked around and provided little if any assistance to guests. That's not a good situation.<//Review>

I love the Ayres.  I stay there for business travel.  It is one of the few places that I actually get a good nights sleep at.  The location is perfect for me.  Close to work, close to shopping, close to rental car gas, close to food and close to the airport.< /Review>

<Review>My short stay was actually one of the worst where  I have stayed in a motel.
The people across from us partied ALL NIGHT LONG.
From what I was told is the person was a employee of yours.
The only positive was we got a hot meal late that night & a warm shower the next morning.

Unfortunately I can't give you a good recommendation, nor will I be visiting again.

It was clear that the security officer turned the eye to the loud mouthed employee of the hotel< /Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

The Hotels Interior design will blow your mind if you're into the retro themed type of deco, wooden specially carved wardrobes and tables, thick designed curtains and just very greek. But if you're like me, who leans more to the "its 2018 design", then you would find the rooms and the interior of the whole Hotel kind of too dark, lights are too deem, and just dont feel very welcoming.

The location though is quite impressive. Fastfood restaurants, Starbucks, Costco and others Shops are just around the Hotel for your convenience.</text>

Nicely located near the 405. Rooms are nice and clean. Self parking (but costs $10 now). WiFi is easy to connect to and fast. This is my preferred place to stay in the El Segundo area.</review>

<rating>4<//rating><Review>My family stayed here during our time of mourning after losing my aunt. We needed someplace near all the services to be together and I am very glad we selected the Ayres hotel.

Only snafu happened upon check-in for my mom and sister, as my fiance and I were paying for both rooms and the person at the front desk at the time told them that wasn't allowed. After getting a manager involved, we were able to move beyond and my mom and sister were able to check in.

Once we arrived, we were very impressed with the lobby and design of the interior. Simply gorgeous!

Our room was big and the bed was cozy.

The parking lot is an absolute mess with the system in place, but we managed to navigate anyway.

Overall, this is a gorgeous hotel with courteous staff on duty who greeted us every time we'd come back into the hotel.</Review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

< review>
Most all was really great - loved the room and the hotel itself.  A couple of issues which prevents me from a perfect score on our stay. Room and hotel very nice, love the courtyard, and the library area especially, and the hotel was quiet and peaceful.  Parking was a good value at $10/day knowing I had a place to park and lot was somewhat secured was great.  The card system getting out of the lot was not good, I had to get out of the car each time and insert the card to exit for some reason.  Staff were courteous and professional however housekeeping missed our room one day even though we were out all day, and I another day they didn't replenish some of the supplies.  I asked the front desk to provide the supplies and they said they would  but we didn't get the needed supplies.  Pool is small. The courtyard was marvelous and we enjoyed sitting outside in peace and quiet.  Beds comfortable, liked the decor in the room and throughout the hotel.  The restaurant - Matisse - was excellent - a bit pricey for dinner, but great for breakfast.  The restaurant staff were great and made us feel like we were VIPs.  Overall I would highly recommend this hotel as the minor issues we had are tweaks that can be made in your operations.  We would certainly consider this hotel again in a future stay, along with the Hotel Hermosa which we also considered before choosing the Ayres.  This was a 40th anniversary vacation so we appreciate the stay experience at the Ayres.< /review>

<Review>After 24+ hrs travelling from Melbourne to LA, 2 hrs of que in customs, 1 hr to retrieve our rental car. We finally get to our hotel at 5 pm, to be told our room will not be ready until 9 pm. As it turns out. Despite us having booked and confirmed our booking for weeks, the hotel cannot do anything about not having any rooms available due to their partnership with an airline. And therefore airline staff are occupying the rooms until their flight leaves. They couldn’t do anything except send us to wait in their restaurant that charged us $35 for a couple of drinks and dessert. DO NOT BOOK THIS HOTEL. NOT WORTH IT.<//Review><Response>{'time': 1536181448131, 'text': 'Dear Paula K, We kindly appreciate you taking the time to share your candid review with us.

<review>For the last 10 years I have stayed numerous times in Ayres hotels with pleasant experiences. I have also recommended the hotel to many of my friends and family.
This time I invited my extended family to stay with us in Ayres hotel. We arrived on Saturday August 13 and checked out on Tuesday August 16. Our room numbers were 307 and 331. Just a Few hours after we left the hotel  on our way home we noticed 2 Ipads(from room#331)  and an SLR camera (from room 307)were missing from their cases.
I called the hotel right away and asked them to check with housekeeping. Nobody seemed to be in charge and  I could not get any straight answer from security staff or the management. After several calls and three hours later I got a call from hotel that they could not find the items in the hotel.
This was the first time that my belongings were stolen in hotel rooms. The experience ruined an otherwise enjoyable vacation.
The fact that these items were taken from their cases in two different rooms is indicative of foul play in your premises.
I am totally disappointed with the experience and replacing the stolen camera and 2 Ipads have cost me over $2500.00.<//review>< rating>

Everything was good, the staff was very friendly, food was yummy. The only problem I had was that the maid day one removed the key card which made my air conditioner stop working. I had shut off all other lights etc. and purposely left my card in the wall to keep the AC running. I wanted the room cooler when I returned. I get that you are trying to conserve but that part is annoying that we can't have a nice air conditioned room when we get in.<//Text>

<Review>the rooms are amazing - spacious and comfortable - the desk had a few crumbs on it when i first arrived, and my room wasnt serviced during my two day stay.  my key card locked me out TWICE which was a little annoying after arriving back with bags of shopping and on my second day the internet locked me out.   this was fixed promptly though after being routed to your service provider.  your reception called a taxi for me to return to the airport and the driver was dreadful - he was honked at and ended up being told off by the security at the airport when he parked on a pedestrial crossing.  not the hotel's fault but maybe another supplier might be better.< /Review><UserId.>117958944243411700842<//UserId.><Rate>4</Rate><Gmap_id>0x80c2b417a15779c7:0xd18227ecdffd65aa</Gmap_id><Resp>{'time': 1538667071751, 'text': 'Dear Sue-Ellen Wilson, We appreciate you taking the time to share your kind review and rating with us!

I love staying at this hotel! Rooms are beautiful, food is amazing, desk concierge are kind and informative, bar and restaurant are lovely, and love the location. I stay at this Ayres at least twice a year becasue of how wonderful they are. If I was to give a suggestion, I would suggest a better walkway from parking to the front door.< /Review>

The facilities are beautiful and clean. The staff was very courteous and willing to help. The biggest drawbacks are 1) the workout facility gets too hot in the morning with the sun pouring in. 2) the breakfast options are nice, but not great (why have a quesadilla without salsa?); especially for the price. 3) Location... although it is a good spot for travelers to LAX, I try to avoid Los Angeles like the plague (so I unfortunately don't see myself returning for that reason alone; but if you build elsewhere, I would look you up). Also, getting in and out of the parking lot can be difficult with traffic; especially if you are not wanting to turn right. 4)  Keep working on the parking lot gates to make sure they work well.</Review>

I wish I could give this hotel a 4.5.   My experience here was very good but it was not perfect.  In particular, there was an unpleasant smell in my room.  I never told them upfront so it's not their fault nothing was done to rectify the situation.  The rest of my experience was very good and I'd recommend this hotel if in the Manhattan Beach area.</Review>

<Review>Very beautiful hotel, felt more like a B&B.  The courtyard made us feel like we weren't even near a big city.
Staff pleasant and very nice.
Only thing I would say is our reservation called for (3) Adults, yet there weren't enough towels, cups and condiments for coffee.  The sofa bed was not made even folded in made, this was not a problem because I asked the staff to please have it made as we were going out.
One of the light-bulbs was flashing and I kept forgetting to let the front desk know until we checked out.  With such a lovely hotel these little items aren't much to talk about but it is the little touches that separate this type of Hotel from the Motel 6's.
Wish they had airport shuttle service.
Overall the hotel was absolutely wonderful and yes I would stay there or at another Ayers property.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

There was a "stranger? homelss man?" at the entrance of the property at the entry way you had to pass, inside security was watching. Also, I was in room 129 celebrating my 40th birthday to relax the strange man was at the back door as I slide my card to get in my room in a hurry, it was scary. I come here for the tranquiliry as its a 2 hour drive from my home, so that was off pudding for me. I will never get a room near that exit door! and the window covering didnt allow for privacy, when I drove the back way I could see into my room with the light on since it only has a sheer.</review>

<time>1536636931295< /time><Text>Check-in was quick and efficient.  The recptionist gave me friendly instructions to my room.  The room was attractively decorated.  I liked that it was eco friendly regarding the electricity.  You just put your room key card in a designated slot, which turned on several lights.  I turned off the ones not needed.  When you left the room you just took the room key with you and the lights went out on their own.  The meal I was served at the event I was attendeding was very delicious.  The bed was very comfortable, which lent for a good night sleep.  Check-out was very fast and directions to exit the parking lot were helpful.  I would reccomment the Ayres Hotel to anyone I know that needs a hotel in this area.<//Text>< user_id>

Additional $15 charge for parking the vehicle (this is new)
No coffee in the lobby and restaurant not open at 5am. No way to get coffee except the coffee machine in the room.

not as nice as expected- the room was wonderful but the noise was crazy- Could not sleep- we cancelled our second reservation in search of a hotel with soundproof glass windows- really bad as we had a corner room and had freeway noise on 2 sides
also the shuttle was a disaster- they said every 2 hours but changed it to 4- and it said they would drop us at the pier which was really the city center and  a 20 minute walk to the pier- with a broken foot this was nuts!
So we had to Uber home....to the hotel- and NO free shuttle from the airport another $29.00
Not for us</review>

{'time': 1466185534263, 'text': 'Dear Lin Burley,\n\nThank you for your valuable feedback. I am saddened to know that we did not exceed nor meet your expectations during your recent stay. Our complimentary shuttle drops off .4mi from the actual coast. We make it a point to drop our guests off as close as resources allow us to, in regards to Manhattan Beach and their public parking/drop off. I am sorry this was an inconvenience for you as you visited with a broken foot. Typically this is a 10 minute or less walk which is pretty standard for beach visitors, however, I can understand your frustration having to do this walk with a broken foot. Should you choose to stay with us again, feel free to ask about our partnership with Roadrunner Shuttles for reduced airport shuttle rates. Thank you again for your review.\n\nSincerely,\n\nDave Lagarce\nGeneral Manager'}<//response>

Had a great stay, all staff was very friendly and helpful. My only recommendation is to upgrade the room key/lock system and the electronic parking gate system, both were rather annoying and seemed to have a mind of their own...working only when they wanted to, which was not most of the time.</text>

<time>1533711103630</time><rate>5</rate><Text>We were a party of four, staying at the hotel for two nights, predominately so we could attend a ELO concert at the Forum in Inglewood on Saturday night. We flew in from Sydney Australia on the Friday and flew home again on Sunday evening.

I booked two rooms at the hotel because of my excellent experience at another Ayres property in Anaheim around five years ago and because of its proximity to the concert venue.

We were not disappointed and I would recommend this hotel above all the others I have stayed at, in the LAX and Manhattan Beach areas.

The staff are professional, accommodating and look after their guests. The hotel itself is beautifully presented and the meals we ate there were lovely. The beds are incredibly comfortable and we found the hotel to be quiet.

There are a number of chain restaurants in the area, a Costco and good access to LA's freeways. Its a short drive or Uber to the close by communities, at Manhattan, Hermosa and Redondo beaches, where you can swim, ride a bike along the foreshore and take your pick from umpteen other restaurants. The hotel also runs a shuttle to Manhattan Beach.

Do yourself a favor and stay here, we enjoyed our stay very much and left with such a positive impression of the hotel and its staff.< /Text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

<text>Room mostly pleasant.
Two complaints
1. I found a used douche bottle under bed skirts when I first checked in. No apology from desk person when I called this to her attention.
2. Staff handling of fire alarm.  Dozens of residents left their rooms and congregated in the lobby due to the alarm. However the main desk people did not acknowledge our presence or give us instructions.  Meanwhile I watched desk clerk check in a person and tell him he could proceed to his room as we waited to know what was going on. That disturbed me.<//text></record>

< review>
Ok, the location isn't perfect but the amenities and staff make up for it.  I held my team meeting (15 people) in August.  The rooms were perfect, the meeting rooms fit our needs perfectly and the staff we professional and helpful.  I have been referring others to them already.< /review>

The hotel and stay were very nice but was not thrilled with the parking situation.  The parking is $10.00 per day but they don't tell you until you check in.  That should be told to you as you're making your reservation. When I was leaving once my room key wouldn't work on the outbound gate so I had to pull back in, park, wait in line at the registration desk to get my key fixed which is very inconvenient. Other than your horrible parking situation the hotel was very nice.< /Review>

We stayed here a few years ago for a family reunion and it was wonderful! So for a family vacation for 5 days we decided to return. Well, this time, not as great. No free breakfast anymore and $10 to park with annoying gates that rarely worked, much less  if you could even pull close enough to insert the key card. I could understand the parking fee if you were boxed in by other businesses that used your parking lot. But I don't think you have overflow parking being on a corner, car dealership nearby and a gas station on the other corner. Parking was never an issue in the past nor was it this visit so the parking fee in my opinion is just like the airlines anymore, just one more way to price gouge a traveler. The view we had was horrible, granted the homeless tent on the other side of the fence isn't your property or your problem, but when paying $1047 for 5 days, it is my problem when I have to keep the drapes closed to avoid looking at it. The shower situation is ridiculous too. I normally take a shower in under 7 minutes. I don't think a shower that barely spits water out is saving any water when you have to stay in there over 20 minutes to wash oneself and get the shampoo and then conditioner out of your hair.  On the up side, you do have a very friendly staff, clean rooms and no complaints with housekeeping. This particular property I would not recommend to any of my family again, and for that I'm sad to say because we all enjoyed it so much before.</text>

<text>The fireplace in the front entry is very welcoming and homey.  We also really enjoyed the pool and patio area.  Unfortunately, the Wi-Fi connection was not good.  I ended up using my phone data instead because the Wi-Fi connection was so slow to load that it was completely impractical.

My son had an allergic reaction to something (we still do not know what).  I do want to thank front desk staff for researching the laundry products and calling us back to help us try to trace the source of the allergy.  It was very helpful.

Other Ayres hotels we have stayed at had breakfast included.  Unfortunately, this one does not.<//text>< pictures>

< review>
The staff and room were very nice however, we were kept up most of the night by freeway noise in room 325.
It seems $190 is over priced for a night that was not very restful.
My husband's work has a yearly event that is often at this hotel but I think next time we will stay elsewhere.<//review>

Very good service, hallways slightly on the confusing side but they still look very good and the pathfinding system (signs, stair placement, etc.) isn't that bad either.<//review>

I will NEVER stay at your chain again.  We have been staying with Ayers for about 7 years.  My husband called to get reservations at this facility and even after they asked if we had stayed with them before no one mentioned anything about the parking situation or the buffet breakfast not included any longer.  We can stay for free at the Westin properties, but my husband chose Ayers for the last 7 years for the free parking and the included buffet breakfast.  When we arrived we we confronted with several gates, so we chose the one that led to the main lobby.  Mistake #1.  When we tried to leave in separate cars, we were delivering my daughter's 18th birthday new car to her at the university, I got out in 9 tries with the room card and my husband couldn't get out to follow me to the school.  He was there for about 8 minutes yelling at the intercom to get out cause he needed to follow me. AND when you go left in the parking lot toward the main lobby, you can only get out of the parking lot about three spots back off the traffic signal or spend 10 minutes making u turns to get onto the 405.  I figured since you are charging for parking now that you are also charging for the breakfast.  I called the front desk and asked if you were charging for breakfast and the person said yes and I asked how much and she simply said "it depends",  What the heck does that even mean?  My husband and I are extremely disappointed in this place.  He thinks the parents are gone now and it's the kids running it into the ground from greed.<//text>

< Review>
Needed to fly out of LAX and Ayres is close to airport and had one of the best ratings in the area.  I booked through the hotel website, at least I thought I did, turns out due to some sort of glitch or error in the system I ended up booking through a 3rd party, which instead of booking me at Ayres booked me at another hotel. When I called to confirm my reservations, I was told that I had none. Luckily, the hotel manager, Ean, was able to fix the situation, though for a moment he instructed me to stay at the other hotel since the 3rd party was being difficult.  I told him that staying elsewhere would not be acceptable given that this booking fiasco was not my fault. Ean then assured me that he would honor my reservation at the price I paid and took care of the matter. However, I still had to call the 3rd party booking service and confirm my cancellation. I would have been extremely pleased if Ean had taken care of the entire situation and not wavered.  Nonetheless, I had a pleasant stay, but I hope no one else has to go through this confusion in the future. All I can suggest is that you confirm your reservations prior to arriving at the hotel.<//Review>

Fantastic food at the Matisse. We went during lunch for a social thing so it wasn't too busy, great service, good selection. It's a little pricey but totally worth it. Certainly keep this place in mind for any gatherings you might be planning.</Text>

The hotel itself is great, especially the service staff, decor, bad cleanliness. I would have rated my overall stay a 5, but the food could be better at the restaurant and room service.</review>

<text>Checkin problems
Key did not work, twice, programming incorrectly
Room very hot, not prepared, normally room is ready for me.  I have been coming to your hotel for years and bringing guests with me always
Breakfast really bad, toast not toasted but fried on the greaser, very greasy,
Olmlet was also really bad,
When I asked for replacement toast they brought a replacement but it had spit all over it, so you could tell some did not like I sent it back.  I got up and left and did not eat breakfast.  Called ruby and she told me I complain to much and not to come back to hotel.

Sad about this, but I agree, I won't come back, at least for a long time
You have lost the recipe, at least with this customer<//text>< Pictures>

The AC did not work. When I called to ask for a couple of ice waters a female in the bar picked up and stated that she was too busy and that room service was a 10$ minimim. I then called the front desk who delivered some water.< /Text>

<rate>5</rate><Text>Overall excellent.  Clean, quiet, comfortable, not too expensive.  Located within walking distance of good facilities of assorted kinds, like restaurants, Starbucks, Staples, Costco (I hear the hotel will lend you a membership card), etc.  Very nice lobby area for sitting around in and chatting.  Surprisingly stable and fast WiFi.  Good restaurant, with a good variety of food, some rather interesting (especially the dinner "share plates"), and not *too* expensive.

The only thing I would ding them on that is under their control is that it seems like nobody reads the email.  If you register online, you get an email saying to reply to it if you have any questions or concerns or changes, but if you do, nobody replies.  I had asked a couple days in advance about transportation from the airport and tried to arrange early checkin... twice... nada.

The other downside, that's *not* their fault, is apparently a problem with the LA area in general.  If want to go anywhere not in walking distance and you don't have a car, you're screwed, because the public transit is horrible.  If you DO have a car, you're *still* screwed, because everybody and their dog are also driving and clogging up the roads!  The solution we found for this is Uber, which we really like.  (Except some of their political stands, but that's another review.)  However, if you're going to go more than a few trips or about 50 miles per day, strongly consider renting a car.  Just be aware that the hotel will also make you pay for parking, and their gate system to get in and out seems like a pain.</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

Convenient location, beautiful rooms, stellar service, free parking and free internet. My husband and I recently took a three-day weekend to LA that turned into a hectic vacation from hell (I'm lookin' at you, USAir)... the Ayres Hotel was the oasis of calm in an otherwise frenetic experience.

P.S. Matisse Restaurant has a yummy Chilean sea bass dish, although it took way too long to come out of the kitchen.<//text>

I'm so disappointed I called on the phone the guy said they serve free breakfast but it was not free maybe he misunderstood me when I asked because I would have went to the seal beach location if so I spent a $189 to be close to home when I could have just drove 20 min to seal beach and pay $127 I stay at this hotel because I love the  complementary breakfast and this location does not have it they should tell people when they book</Text>

(Translated by Google) European-style 4 star hotel, location 10 minutes, close to many shopping malls, restaurants, supermarkets, etc., 15 minutes drive to Mancington Beach, there are many famous restaurants next to the beach, the hotel area traffic is also 10 minutes convenient.
I am driving by car. There are three parking places. The parking arrangement is also very good. I use the eaves as a parking pole for the parking lot. It is convenient for 10 minutes.
The room is happy, clean, I admire the harder bed, and support the body for 10 points.
Most of the time, there are two stoves in the lobby. When I stayed, the temperature was around 7 degrees in the evening. Guests could ignite the stove and sit around and chat. The atmosphere is good.

(Original)
歐陸風情的4星酒店，地點 10分好，鄰近許多購物商場，餐廳，超市等等，開車15分鐘便能去到曼克頓海灘，海灘旁邊有很多著名餐廳，酒店區域交通也10分便利。
我是自駕遊的，有三個泊車地點，泊車方面安排也很好，用房咭作為開停車場的泊車杆， 10分方便。
房間歡堂、整潔、我我欣賞床辱比較硬，承托身體10分好。
最特別是大堂之內有兩個火爐，我入住的時候晚上氣溫是7度左右，客人們可以點燃火爐坐在旁邊閑聊， 氣氛好好。<//review>

<text>Todo hubiera estado muy bien sino hubiéramos tenido una muy mala recepción la noche que llegamos. Lamentablemente nos tocó una persona que al parecer no le gusta su trabajo, muy malos modales, cero ganas de ayudar a resolver un problema. Y para colmo nos manda a una habitación que ya estaba ocupada. Afortunadamente el resto del personal excelente, muy atentos. Espero que hablen con esta persona porque aunque no le guste, su trabajo es atención al cliente. Y repito, por lo demás fue una experiencia agradable.</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

Chambres immenses. Emplacement très pratique quand on arrive de laéroport et pour rayonner dans Los Angeles. Même si lhôtel se trouve à un carrefour de voies de communication, le calme est de mise à lintérieur avec un contraste total. Quartier daffaire sûr, avec une voiture tout est rapidement à côté sans difficulté de circulation. Manhattan Beach est à 10 minutes et cest un endroit superbe, plein de restaurants sympa et un glacier délicieux ! Excellent rapport qualité prix à Los Angeles.</Text><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None<//resp><gmapID>0x80c2b417a15779c7:0xd18227ecdffd65aa< /gmapID></record>

<text>Der Standpunkt des Hotels ist sowohl für einen Ausflug zum Strand als auch für Besichtigungstouren gut geeignet. Als Strandhotel würde ich es nicht bezeichnen, da die Entfernung doch etwas weiter ist, keinesfalls zu Fuß machbar. Insgesamt ist es gut ausgestattet, sehr ruhig, wenn man ein Zimmer zum Innenhof hat. Das Personal ist freundlich und stets hilfsbereit. Ein Minuspunkt ist das eintönige Frühstück, das für ein Haus dieser Kategorie definitiv nicht ausreicht. Der Pool ist etwas klein, aber da das Wetter am Strand auch im August nicht immer zum Baden einlädt, doch ganz praktisch. Sehr ansprechend ist die Gartenanlage gestaltet. Zum Essen gibt es rundherum etliche Möglichkeiten: Größere Einkaufszentren, sowie Schnellimbisse und kleinere Restaurants. Das Hotel selbst hat ebenfalls ein Restaurant. Der 1-wöchige Aufenthalt war sehr angenehm, vor allem die Sauberkeit des geräumigen Zimmers hat überzeugt.<//text>< Gmap_id>

Allerdings waren die Fenster so gut gedämmt, dass man erstaunlicherweise nichts mitbekommen hat. Das Hotel selbst erscheint im Innenbereich in einem tollen Ambiente, was an ein englisches Schloss erinnert, in dem man sich sofort wohlfühlen kann. Wenn man hier eincheckt, sollte man einen Mietwagen dabei haben, ansonsten ist es schwer eine Anbindung nach LA zu finden. Das ist in Los Angeles allgemein ohne Mietwagen schwierig. Wenn es etwas zu bemängeln gibt, dann ist es das Frühstücksangebot, was äußerst dürftig aus europäischer Sicht a la Carte angeboten wurde. Für Toast, Ei und etwas Obst 15$ pro Person erschien es uns auch sehr teuer.

<Review>Das Hotel ist direkt neben der vielbefahrenen Autobahn I5 und nur wenige Minuten vom Flughafen entfernt. Unser Zimmer zeigte aber nicht in Richtung Autobahn und hatte sehr gute Fenster, deswegen hat man nichts gehört. Die Mitarbeiter sind sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit. Das Zimmer (1 Queen Size Bed und ein Schlafsofa) war ziemlich groß und mit allem Nötigen ausgestattet (auch Mikrowelle und Kühlschrank). Man kann kostenlos parken und hat kostenloses WLAN. Das ebenfalls kostenlose Frühstück ist auch ganz gut und es gibt nicht nur Corn Flakes, Milch, Marmelade und Toast, sondern auch Eier und Speck, Pfannkuchen, Waffeln und wirklich gutes frisches Obst. Nur der Kaffee war total dünn und nicht zu genießen.</Review><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None< /Response><gmapID>0x80c2b417a15779c7:0xd18227ecdffd65aa</gmapID></record>

(Translated by Google) The hotel is well located near Manhattan Beach, about 15 minutes by car without traffic and the area is not as ugly as the one near the airport.

We had problems: the first day, we checked early but there was no room, we consigned the suitcase and when we arrived at night we did not have a room, after 45 minutes of waiting they gave us one below what we contracted and the next day they promised us move to a suite, but it was not.

The last day, after arriving at night, they had not made the room and after protesting twice, they made the bed.

As compensation, they have discounted the price of one night. Therefore, bittersweet taste, the hotel is fine and spacious, but maybe we were unlucky.

El hotel esta bien localizado cerca de Manhattan Beach, en coche como a 15 minutos sin trafico y la zona no es tan fea como la cercana al aeropuerto.

Hemos tenido problemas: el primer dia, hicimos checking temprano pero no habia habitacion, consignamos la maleta y al llegar a la noche no teniamos habitacion, despues de 45 minutos de espera nos dieron una por debajo de lo que contratamos y al siguiente dia nos prometieron cambiarnos a una suite, pero no fue asi.

El ultimo dia, tras llegar en la noche, no habian hecho el cuarto y despues de protestar dos veces, hicieron la cama.

Como compensación, nos han descontado el precio de una noche. Por tanto, sabor agridulce, el hotel esta bien y es espacioso, pero tal vez tuvieramos mala suerte.<//Text>

We stayed 4 days in this very comfortable hotel who looks like a 18th century italian palace located in the middle of the highway network who brings you everywhere in LA very easily.I strongly recommend this location for who want to visit LA and want to saty in a very cosy atmosphere.Only one thinks failed : the non apropriate and very expensiv breakfast.</Text>
