They came out…assessed an issue. Left believing it had been resolved. When contacted them they were quick to send out their technician again to make sure it was sorted out.< /Review>

First Appliance Repair was great to work with! The appointment was set up quickly. Both the dispatcher and repairman were polite. The repairman was on time, worked efficiently, and explained the problem with my washer thoroughly. The cost was very reasonable. I would choose them again for my needed appliance repairs!</Review>

Booked through Google at 9PM, they had availability 1-3PM the following day for our broken refrigerator water dispenser. They called and even came a little early the next day. The specific part had to be ordered as the original was discontinued, Jason was excellent and the service was superb. I will be calling First Appliance Repair in the future when things break.</Review>

< review>
My AC kept turning off after few minutes after a house exterior paint job that included a pressure wash. Oscar diagnosed it as a possible fan issue. I was quoted 800$ for replacing the fan. I asked him if we can rule out the circuit breaker as that could be a potential issue but he will not look at that angle as he said that won’t be an issue and he said it must be a short in the system. Well it turns out I saved a bunch of money as it turned out to be the circuit breaker which costs just 11$ at Home Depot. Beware of being overcharged and misdiagnosed. What is more he also wanted 250$ to replace a capacitor which takes a total of 5 min to replace and 20$ for the part itself.

Edit: responding to the technician Oscar. I am telling the truth. Before posting this review, I had called his office to discuss and they never called back. Later I even offered to talk to him after he was upset I left the review but he won’t talk to me. Also some 5* reviews here are from friends and family< /review>

<rating>5< /rating><Gmap_id>0x808fbfd3ee65967d:0x9b9ff5d641aa93d4</Gmap_id><review>Our refrigerator died this week. It was one of the LG models that is known for problems with the linear compressor. Oscar had us back up and running very quickly. He didn't replace the compressor with the older model that's known to break, he replaced it with a newer version instead and he also replaced the main power board. I was impressed with the efficiency and professionalism of this company.<//review></record></dataset><record>
< review>
I'm really happy that I found First Appliance.  I had a somewhat complicated (to me) heating issue that was diagnosed quickly and at a fair price.  Oscar is incredibly knowledgeable - I really appreciate that he took the time to help me understand how the heating system works, what things often go wrong, and what kinds maintenance I can perform to prevent common failures in the future.

The whole process was fantastic - they respond quickly; show up on time; and even have a nice app for booking and payments.< /review>

My freezer stopped freezing and I made the mistake of picking First Appliance Repair based on Google reviews.  I asked them up front for an idea of how much the repair might cost and they said around $220 for labor plus parts.  The guy came out and diagnosed the issue as a blockage in the freon system.  He said the repair would cost $400.  The cost sounded high but he made it sound like it was a very labor intensive repair and I needed it fixed so I said ok.  45 minutes later he was done.  I asked him why it was so expensive since it was less than an hour of labor and no parts.  He held up a can of something called Acid Scavenger and said, "This stuff costs $180!"  I went ahead and paid the bill only to find out later that Acid Scavenger costs like $20.

I called the company the next day to try to get a better understanding of what exactly they charged me for.  I asked for a manager and the first person I got said she would look into it, then never called back.  I called about five hours later and talked to another "manager" who proceeded to give me three different explanations for the cost of the repair.  They sent me an invoice that listed several other items including a piercing valve which costs like $5 plus other "parts" they supposedly used.  As far as I can tell, they charged me $180 for like $25 worth of parts.  The manager was totally unapologetic at one point saying, "Well, we fixed it for you, would you have done it yourself?"  I found everyone I dealt with to be incredibly condescending.  I suggest staying away from these guys.</text>

My stack washer-drier is in a tight spot.  The diagnostic repair guy found the problem but removed the exhaust venting from the drier to be able to move the unit around.  The repair person was a different guy.  He replaced a part.  He said he didn’t have the materials to put the exhaust vent back (it was damaged when removed) and left without putting it back or moving the unit back into place.  I ran the washer and again the spill pan again filled with water.  I contacted them again and they sent someone back the next day.  It’s fixed!< /Text>

<text>Called to get washer fixed on 2/6, came out said I needed a door lock would order part and come back on 2/12 to install.  Not bad considering a weekend in between.  I call on the 11th to get time frame they say 9-11.  The 12th comes and goes no call no show.  I call on the 2/13 sorry we'll look into it and call back.  No call back so I call on the 2/14.  So sorry we can come tomorrow.  No thanks it's a Saturday can you come Monday sure be there between 9-11.  Monday 2/17  no call no show.  I call again we'll look into and get back to you.  Never heard back so call now I'm mad I want a manager.  Ok manager will call you back.  Manager Constantin calls me back on Wednesday so sorry we never got the part well be in tomorrow and we'll go and install and give you a discount.  Me being a logical persons says listen odds of part coming in and you installing that day are slim just schedule for Friday in the morning.  He says sure no problem.  Friday no one shows I get a call about 1 saying sorry part didn't arrive can we come Monday.  Sure!  Monday comes I get a call around 2 the repair man is stuck at a long job can we come Tuesday.  Sure!  Finally Tuesday around 2 the job is done.  Wouldn't you know the repair man has no notes or anything about a discount.  Worse repair experience ever by far.  So unprofessional, everytime I called it was like the first time they ever heard of me.  The kicker is every time I got off the phone I got a text with a $10 off code.  If I could have combined all the $10 off they would have ended up paying me for the job.</text><user_name>jose Crowley</user_name></record></dataset><record>

Rocky's appt with me was for 6:00 P M. He called  at 4:00, said he had extra
time and came out. Diagnosed the problem with our freezer, showed me and
ordered the part as I watched, and showed up within 48 hours of first meeting him to install it. Even added at no cost an additional part that "could someday wear out" just  to cover any eventuality.  A class act from
the initial phone call. ! !</text>

Never called to say they couldn't.  Instead of refunding, they charged double the amount. It's been 2 weeks, about 6 calls, and they just keep saying "we can't find the receipt, we need a code to refund, the bank is not open to get a code we need, our machine is new,, the boss is not here, we'll call 1st thing in the morning,  call back later, tomorrow. They've stolen our money, given nothing for it and don't care to refund us when they gave her flowers away and insisted on delivering! DON'T BUY HERE!<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None< /resp><GmapID>0x80dbf366f4c39bef:0xe1cfbd0b157f32e1</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

The owners were patient and caring with us as well as sensitive to our needs when we purchased flowers for our daughter's Celebration of Life ceremony. They even made samples for us to look at.  I highly recommend them.<//Text>

<review>Ordered 2 bouquets four days before Mother's Day with 11am pickup time. Had to visit the store 3 times to get my order completed. Was told they would call me when it was ready and they never called. One of the bouquets wasn't even made until my last trip there at 5pm before they closed. Couldn't ever reach them by phone because the phone was always busy. Im usually patient but this was just a really bad experience all around, and partly ruined the holiday for us with all the hassles. Never going back here and will be telling others to go somewhere else.</review>< pictures>

Just went to this flower shop today with my son to get flowers for his girlfriend. They have beautiful fresh flowers and rainbow colored roses. They were beautiful and smells wonderful. The best part of this experience is the customer service. The man that helped us was great and very knowledgeable with flowers. He helped us picked flowers and showed different variations. I will definitely come back for more occasions that my family celebrates. I definitely recommend this flower shop to everyone if you want satisfying beautiful flowers.</review>

I live out of town, so I asked them to deliver flowers for my mom's birthday. I spoke with them over the phone and they were able to create a beautiful arrangement for her and delivered it the same day! She loved it so much and I'm very grateful they were able to work within my budget!</text>

<Review>I live in Los Angeles and needed to send flowers to my aunt for her birthday, I found this place online and they went above and beyond to help me out! They looked for the roses I wanted and made sure they had the perfect vase and delivered then right in time to surprise my aunt. This meant the world to her, since the pandemic I haven't been able to visit her and this was my only way to showed her my appreciation on her special day.

They sent me pictures of the bouquet before they delivered it to make sure I liked it.
These people are very professional! I am glad I found them and was able to support their business during this time.<//Review><GmapID>0x80dbf366f4c39bef:0xe1cfbd0b157f32e1</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

I had a need to send flowers. I called Hummingbird Florist and explained what I wanted. They were able to do everything that I requested. The flowers were delivered to my friend and they are beautiful. Thank you Hummingbird Florist! The floral arrangement is gorgeous!!!!!  You were efficient and you did what you said you would do. Excellent.< /Review>

I tried Humming Bird Florist for the first time this week. They were outstanding! The flowers were beautiful and Jesus and his staff were very helpful in creating a bouquet that was fitting for the occasion.  So glad I found them!!!<//text>

I had a friend who's birthday was today and I am on the opposite end of the country, I wanted to send flowers of some sort and thought a bamboo would be perfect. I called the shop and the guy was VERY helpful, upbeat, and high focus on service. I asked him if he had any, and he went out of his way to say "let me text you some pictures first", which he did and let me pick out exactly what I wanted, and even asked if I wanted a card since it was for an occasion. What an amazing person, I wish I could have given him a hug. He setup delivery over the phone and even got it out same day. I am simply speechless, I can't recommend these guys enough, please give them a chance!<//text>

We're not from the area and found them on Google and they're the only place open on Sunday. We were here last year at an other florists and we liked hummingbird florists much better. They were both extremely friendly and not ridiculously expensive.< /Text>

I live in Washington State and ordered an arrangement for my grandaughter's first new home in Escondido.  Jesus was wonderful about making sure that I would be pleased before it was delivered.  He sent me a text with a picture of the finished arrangement which was lovely and beautifully designed.  I could not have been more pleased...particularly because the transaction was done over the phone.  From now on, all my orders for flowers will be from Hummingbird Florist. Thanks Jesus.< /Review>

<Review>My wife and I will never go here again. Nor will we ever recommend this company to anyone. We trusted Hummingbird Florist with making the bouquets, center pieces, my wife's bouquet and our boutonnieres for our wedding. We even paid for our complete order months in advance and checked in with Pilar (owner) a few days prior to our big day. We were scheduled to pick up the flowers the morning of our wedding at 8:30am...just to show up any find out that the flowers were not only not ready, the other workers had no idea an order was being picked up that morning. Our flowers weren't ready till 10:30am; which obviously delayed our setup plans and added much more un-needed stress. Also, my wife's bouquet looked nothing like we expected and agreed on with Pilar. In fact, many of the much cheaper bouquets at Albertsons and Vons look much better and are only a fraction of the price. I wouldn't recommend Pilar and her business to anyone; unless you'd like to add more stress to yourself on your important day and deal with someone so unprofessional.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

I have had two vehicles serviced there, a Mini Cooper and a Jeep. I have really never encountered such excellent service before ..... and I am eighty years old. They are very friendly and communicative. I believe they are very honest and competent. I, myself, know very little about cars, but am generally and professionally quite experienced and competent. Their work has a lifetime guarantee (but I don’t know the details). They provide pick-up service and/or courtesy loaner cars.

I think their prices are slightly high, compared to competition (I may be wrong), but you have to expect to pay for what you get, and what I get from them I have never found anywhere else. I am a devoted customer so long as we both shall live.< /text><pictures>None</pictures><rating>5<//rating></record></dataset><record>

My appointment was easy to get.  People were friendly and courteous.  I was given a loaner as my car was going to take longer than I anticipated.  It was in good condition.  It’s in good condition as far as I can tell.<//Text>

Jeff is the new manager; he's upbeat and positive! Always a plus for someone who is downright terrified of getting car maintenances. My check engine light came on for the second time in the span of a month. I brought it in, and finally got an answer and solution to end the engine light problem. They fixed it in an hour and were speedy in letting me know. I'm very happy with their services, and I will definitely be coming back (but hopefully not anytime soon). Thanks!</Text>

Chuck was able to figure out why my check engine light was on.  He then referred it to Miguel to take care of the problem.  The quality of the work saves me thousands of dollars that I don't need to spend on monthly payments because my vehicle is payed off.</text>

I had a family friend recomend Taylor CO. to my son who had a coolent/oil leak that we were told would thounds to fix. Taylor Co. Looked it and
Fixed it for couple of hundred $ been running just fine afterward. Took my f150 for service and they repaired my brakes that had "just been fixed at my old shop" less than a year ago. By They repaired my wifes honda after the transmission was repared at the old shop and ran poorly.  Chuck the service writer could tell that the old shop had adjusted the trans incorrectly.

All said and done I feel that I will get a straight answer for my questions about the service and feel that the work has been peformed in the past to my cars is way above par. The prices have to me seem that they are fair.< /review>< Pictures>

I switched from a Mercedes to a Toyota and I needed a good local repair shop. I found Taylor Co on Yelp and I haven't looked back since. Sam and Levi have been awesome by keeping me updated step by step and even offering a ride or a loaner car while I wait. Once everything is done, they send you a link of your cars diagnostic via text. So gnarly. An added bonus is that the lobby is simply beautiful. Doesn't make you feel dirty like most auto shops. HIGHLY recommended! Thank you all so much.</Review>

I went in today because my car was making a clunking horseshoe sound from underneath and something felt loose. I drive a long distance to work and home 5 days a week. Chuck asked if I could leave my car so they could check it out. Well he found the problem and took care of it. I now feel safe and don't worry about being stranded. I received great service and have nothing but Praise for the way they took care of my car.
He runs a honest shop and I received great customer service.
Thank you Chuck.<//Text>

I've never received better auto repair service. Before anything was done, Taylor Auto Service provided an clearly documented engine diagnostic assessment to guide the repair plan. Sam was extremely personable and professional. He made sure I was satisfied with the work they did and the price of the services. Great customer service. I highly recommend this place and will be bringing my other car for service.< /Text>

Nothing but the best, I’ve been coming here for a year with two of my Toyota’s. These guys know what they are doing and have awesome customer service.

I’m amazed on how great they’re prices are, it’s like going to a dealer but not waiting on those long lines at the service department.

They always back they’re work with warranty witch is always great!< /review>

I was very pleased with their professionalism and their work. Mr John Taylor kept me updated on everything they were doing to my car by texting me the Inspection report of what was being replaced. Everything was done promptly and the total cost was reasonable. When I went to pick up my car in the their courtesy loaner car, I was very pleased to see they had also cleaned my car. I will definitely tell my friends , family and neighbors to take their cars to this shop for any kind of repairs.<//review>

<user>103645794229520102421</user><review>Taylor Co. was absolutely a pleasure to do work with. Stop taking your car to the dealer. The breakdown and 60 point inspection (pictures) of your vehicle will give you a more realistic and accurate breakdown of your vehicle.

I have a daily commuter vehicle with 200k mileage and average about 2k per month. I needed a reliable and honest service mechanic to bring my car to better than average safety mecanical standards.

They only use the best parts and products available at a competitive price. They have a outstanding warranty and guarantee also.

Don’t go to your friends buddy or “I know a guy/gal who can do it for cheap”. anymore.

Taylor Co. is my local mechanic that I’ll use for all my vehicle needs.

Great customer service! Thank you!</review></record></dataset><record>

Amazing service, Hands down. I'm dumping my old shop and coming here. The level of service is second to none. Working in customer service as long as I have, this is quality of service that I expect (I have very high standards) for a auto repair shop. Talk to John the service manager and you won't go wrong.</Text>

This experience was 2nd to none.  I am rethinking buying another car because they cared enough to reinforce the durability of the car I have. More importantly they found ways to save me money compared to services that others suggested I need. Experience was outstanding. HIGHLY recommend.< /Review>

<Text>Honesty, knowledgeability and professionalism at its finest. From the moment you step in the door they treat you with top of the line customer service, John, the manager on site, is one of the most easy going guys out there, he’ll tell you exactly what needs to be done and he’ll move some strings to make sure you get a great bargain. Over all the easiest process regarding getting my car back to a healthy drivable state of mind. Oh...and their customers’ safety is #1 to them, try them out, you won’t regret it.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Rate>

<Review>Samuel and the guys at Taylor Co. Were great and honest work.I brought my Civic in with a huge rattle coming from the front passenger wheel area, they checked it out and turns out that it was just a loose and bent back brake cover that they fixed at no charge. You don't get much service like that anymore!! I appreciate their honest work....I will be back!

This is the cleanest mechanic's shop I have ever seen. The whole staff is highly professional and knowledgeable about the idiosyncrasies of Japanese cars. Definitely recommend.<//Review>

We're content with our experiences with Taylor Co. Although somewhat more expensive, I believe you get what you pay for in quality here. Only one issue I had was the solicitation of an alignment Iquestioned was necessary or possibly could have waited. But the car's performance proved it was necessary after all. Thanks to Samuel and Charles.< /Text>

<Text>First time to this service center. Sam was nothing but honest and professional on all levels. Mechanic Mike went beyond of what was expected and my issue was repaired on time for the quoted cost. I was most impressed of their pin point evaluation on every aspect of my car that noted conditions as well as possible issues in the future.
Next time my Acura needs service I will call them first and not shop around!<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

Honestly think the coworkers made their own good reviews 😒<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

The wax lady was rude to me, and so was the lady that did my pedicure. As i proceeded to pay, I was rudely asked if my card had money on it, which it did. No other customer was treated this way except for me. Im just saying if you are a person of color, mainly black, you will not get good service here. Im never coming here again</text>< Pictures>

<review>Back to Basics! I made an appointment for 1:30 it’s already 2:25 and I’m still waiting. I had booked 2 pedicures , 1 full set & a manicure. People continued to walk in & be seated for pedicures while we waited. I used to be a regular here. The lady in charge makes up her own prices & does not honor prices on there board. She got into 2 Arguments with customers while I was there because she was overcharging. Tony my regular nail guy took a client right before my appointment time and had me wait then when I complained about the pedicure they told me to wait until I had my nails done. This place is a train wreck not to mention they were sanitizing very well after every client! They lost a loyal customer after 2yrs<//review>< Date>

Used to go here for years, and then my regular nail technician left. The owner straight up lied to me about him leaving & said he was on vacation, and then I was charged an extra $7.00 than my regular price for a basic full set with regular nail polish. They neglected to tell me of the major price increase. Also the owner lied to me and said the person doing my nails was his brother filling in for him. Luckily I have my regular nail technicians phone number, and will be going to his new nail salon. The new nail technician who did my nails did a terrible job, and my nails are a weird shape. Never again will I go here, they lost a loyal customer. If your going to charge high end nail salon prices don’t use cheap products. SMH< /Review>

<text>I enjoy these people very much. I have found them to be skilled and efficient, but also caring and kind. I love the pedicure massage chair. Sometimes, when they are busy, they can be a bit sharp in their instructions, but that is understandable.  I like they way my nails look when I leave and that is what I went there to do. I will go back.< /text><name>Linda DeWald<//name><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Date>

They were extremely rude they were all talking about me and their native language so I started speaking in Spanish to show them what it felt like. She said she was not talking about me but talking about a funeral and I told her I was talking about a funeral too what a coincidence. I will never go there again. I felt like they all ganged up on me. I was literally intimidated and a little scared when they all started yelling at me. I never felt welcomed and I told her I would never shop there again meaning the owner. And I was treated this way because I had the nerve to question their prices< /Text>

And then I replied with  “what time do you close?” and the lady rudely said “no, what do you need” which was already starting to be a bad sign for me. I proceeded to tell her I wanted a full set, then said she could assist me right away so I accepted. Then I showed the lady doing my nails a picture of what I wanted (cow print nails), she said ok, and then did a really bad job, note I don’t expect it to be perfect at all, but she totally ruined my nails, they even had bumps, and after she finished I was charged 40 dollars!! because I had asked for gel, note, I never asked for gel, the conversation wasn’t even Boughten up! Then I told her I hadn’t asked for gel which she then said ok, then 35. Still alot for a lousy job!! only good thing was my nail technician was somewhat nice.... not coming back.<//Review>< Date>

This is the worse nail place I have ever been to!! The people that work there are very unprofessional. I went for a pedicure and eyebrow wax the woman that did my pedicure did not do what I asked her to do they didn't even have the color I picked and she was very pushy about doing other things when I said only pedi and wax  she gave me an attitude, she burn me with the wax.. I regret spending my money there, I could have done a better job myself at home!  I am never going back there again I got out of there very frustrated and unhappy</review>

I just got my nails done last night and they’re already lifting !! The lady who did my nails was rough while filing and when i had asked her to kindly be more gentle just went even more harder and grabbed my hand when i tried to pull away. She insisted that i get gel and talked to the lady behind her in a rude way about me in their language, i knew she was talking about me because the other lady looked up at me and rolled her eyes ! I wouldn’t recommend coming here, spend your money elsewhere where it’ll be worth it :)<//Text>< pics>

<Review>NO STAR DESERVED. Don't even want to put one star but I have to to leave a review. Very rude and unprofessional. Went in to take nails off that they put on and get just gel with a manicure. did not smile or conversate everytime I tried with them. Way over charged me and charge me for a manicure when I did not get a manicure unless painting my nails and little file is a manicure. Do not go here they are not worth the time or money.< /Review><Response>None<//Response><user_name>Danean Newton</user_name><Pics>None</Pics></record>

Very poor service<//Review>

<Text>Bad experience here. Walked out with a bloody toe! And the older lady was rude she wanted to do more work and I declined.  She started hollering like bother in her language.  She did not follow anything that I asked for.
Right now at 1am I'm still dealing with the burning feeling for the cut.
She didn't show no concern or apologized for what happened.  Careless people all they care its about money .< /Text><rate>1<//rate>< Name>

1. Didn't have to wait very long (maybe like 20 minutes) but was asked to change tables twice. I ended up at the one I started at.

2. The woman doing my nails didn't bother to  clean or clip them before starting.

3. She also wasn't wearing gloves or a mask. She didn't wash her hands when she moved on from client to the next. Her hands were filthy when she finally got to me.

4. This woman complained about the person she saw before me, who was still in the salon, right behind me, the whole time.

5. She told me she couldn't do the shape or length I wanted, it wouldn't look good.

5. She kept insisting I get gel polish. After I finally said yes, she told me they were out of the pink I wanted but had a nice dark purple shade that would "be much better." No.

6. After she finishes, she takes the same disposable nail file and pair nippers she was using on my hands and proceeds to use them on the feet of her next client.

All in all this place is disgusting, the staff is rude, they're horrible at keeping appoitments, they told multiple people to come back tomorrow, and my nails lasted six days before the first one came off. Don't go here, I'm certainly never going back.< /review>< user_id>

I liked this place, until today. I made an appointment at 11 am for 2pm with Daniel. When I get there 5 minutes before my appointment he already had 2 other ladies at his table. He then says, “oh, Sorry I can’t help you because I have other clients. Someone else can help you.” He knew I was coming he shouldn’t have overbooked. 😒 I specifically made an appointment with him for a reason. Besides the fact, the lady at table 6, rude asf! 😡 She kept giving me eye rolls. I accidentally hit my nail on something, I asked if she can fix it and she gave me attitude. Customers come First Lady, and today you just lost one because you are Rude! Plus a fill and color change shouldn’t be $33, that’s like a freakin new set. 🙄</Text>

<review>BE CAREFUL! ! They overcharge u. They don't ask u if u want other services or explain fees. They when you go to pay they quote higher price. When I asked for explanation, they played the "english no so good". SMH. I usually go to 2 ladies there & I get AWESOME service WITHOUT SURPRISES.

I got a fill this past Saturday, it has been 3 days and my Gel polish is chipped already. In addition another nail already broke completely off. I called and the receptionist was rude and she said I should have got a full set, they are not responsible with a fill. Well I paid $70 for gel my fill, and pedi 😒... I’ll never go to them again.<//text>

<Pics>None< /Pics><Text>If I could give 0 stars I would. I’m not gonna rant on about everything that bothered me because then y’all would be reading a book. But before I came In I called to make sure there was no wait because I was in a rush and they said there was none and I ended up waiting 30 min. They moved my seat 3 different times because I asked for ombré which only one person in the store knows how to do. I asked the lady that was doin my nails if she was able and comfortable with doing what I was asking for and she reassured me she knew what she was doing. She removed my acrylic by jamming her own nail under my nail which caused Layers of my real nail to peal off and was so painful I started to bleed. Then she finally got to the painting and let’s just say she had no clue what she was doing. My nails were not what I asked for and every time I asked her to make a change she mocked my voice and would repeat what I said over and over again. I have little hairs and bumps stuck in my nail. I didn’t even get the shape nail I asked for because coffin shaped short “won’t look nice” I don’t suggest coming to this shop. Some people in there I’m sure are good at their jobs but my experience was completely dreadful and unenjoyable.<//Text><resp>None<//resp>< rating>

<text>I went in over two months ago to get an acrylic set out on. Igot the coffin shape and the shape was uneven. I believe the guy who did my nails name was David. Two weeks later my nail started to lift. I went to a nail salon in Idaho because I'm currently out of state and they fixed the nail the first time and then two more started to lift so I went in and had them remove the set to totally redo it. And all my nail beds are damaged and I have two nails with an infection due to unclean utensils and filing my nail too deep. I would never recommend this place. All my nails hurt and are breaking.</text>< user>

Worst experience i have ever had!  If i have an appointment why do i have to wait?  On top of that to wait so long and they do a bullshit ass job, i could have save my money and did it myself!  I do not recommend this place to no one.  I wouldn't even want free nails done from here!  It isn't worth it.  When you do voice your complaint they brush it off and disregard what you say...</text>

Went in to get manicure with gel polish. The lady was rushing through my manicure, very messy, my gel polish fell off within 3 days (i have had gel polish last 3 weeks when done at other places). Wouldn't recommend.</Review>

I went in there a couple days ago to get a pedicure and manicure....NEVER AGAIN! They were extremely rude! The lady who did my pedicure made my heel bleed. After she painted my fingernails, I waited 30 minutes under the dryer and the paint just melted off.
JUST TERRIBLE!!!!</Review>

We love this place!  Always going back for the KFC (Korean Fried Chicken).... Went in today and saw this Ginger Soy Chicken on the menu, another favorite for My Wife & Myself.  What’s even better is, there’s many options to choose from that we haven’t even tried yet.  Thanks for the delicious Korean food Seoul Sausage!<//text>

< Review>
Middling food, high price, poor experience.

Seoul Sausage is a Korean + Sausage fusion restaurant. Dishes include Kalbi sausage with kimchi relish, chicken sausage, Korean fried chicken, and others (the menu was not fully built out yet. Combos include a can of soda and tater tots for $3 extra. You order using a tablet.

First, the food. My group tried everything that was available on the menu (the restaurant was not fully stocked since it literally JUST opened): Kalbi sausage with kimchi relish, chicken sausage, Korean fried chicken, and the tater tots. These were all... fine. Nothing really to write home about. The Kalbi sausage with Kimchi relish should have been a wow, but it could have just as easily been a bratwurst. The chicken sausage was a sweeter version of andoiulle sausage. I was unimpressed. The fried chicken was better, but needed something to go with it to balance the dish. And the tater tots were, well, tater tots. For the price ($8 for 1 small sausage on a bun) we expected to get something substantial or something that really WOWed us.

The experience. I couldn't stand the experience. Cold, detached, and not friendly. The user orders for themselves using a small terminal, but nobody saw that you had to do this. The terminals just looked like point of sale terminals, not self service kiosks. I didn't see any signage for it, either. The kitchen is open, and the chefs are right there to look at you, but they didn't help either. The presentation was a little weak - the food came in simple paper cartons and drinks are just cans of soda.

To sum up, Seoul Sausage has many of the trappings of a food truck - fusion fare, loud noise, sort of rude staff, cans of coke, high prices - but none of the charm or exceptional food.<//Review>

<Review>Located in the Oxnard's Collection Annex, this was my first time here.  I had the  Sweet and Spicy Chicken Bowl which had sweet and spicy chicken sausage, kimchi rice, fried egg and house hot sauce.  There was a little kick to the spicy chicken but it was just right.  The service was good and fast.  After eating here, the family and I went and saw a movie at the nearby theatre.  Good time was had by all.</Review>< pictures>

<Text>Loved the #1 spicy sausage on a bun!

Pro Tip: while you're watching on your food, this place is right by the "Bottle & Pint" so get a beer too! They go GREAT together!<//Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMElU7vGtqrvFkW3n3wopWILS4XkKsq6-ROO3Ql=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures><Response>None<//Response><gmap_id>0x80e84cf8f5e578e7:0x54c0b00eeada1d3f< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I came here on a Monday night thinking it was going to be busy but the service was great. The food was different but it was very good. This place reminded me of Gen Korean BBQ that’s at the collection as well. The service of the workers were great and very helpful. I will definitely be coming back and will be telling others about this place.< /Review>

I had a #2 combo a couple weeks ago and it was delicious ! I went in for another one yesterday and it was not the same quality . It was a different man who made it for me , “black LA hat”.  The other younger man should definitely work more ! The quantity was too little and no show of neatness .  No disrespect but guy needs more training .</Review>

This place looks really cool and the menu looked tasty.   Unfortunately the service is awful.   Firstly 2 employees stood in place staring at us not taking our order when we said we were ready.

They got one of our orders wrong and had attitude when we simply checked to see if we were mistaken.   After sending the order back it returned 20 minutes the same wrong order.

Never coming back again.<//Review>

<review>This establishment clearly needs more training. Sad to say it’s the manager that needs it the most. If you’re told be a customer that the order is wrong, there is no reason to treat a PAYING customer poorly. Just do your job & fix the issue? Poor service, will not return.<//review><Rating>1<//Rating>< date>

<user_name>nicole ariana</user_name><Text>Think of this place as a hidden treasure. it’s in the back of the annex food hall, and it is so underrated!! for the most part it’s cheap and your portions will get you full. right now i’m having trouble trying to finish the tater tots!! my brother got the california bowl and he’s loving it.
i recommend completely!! plus, whoever is in charge the music, send me your playlist because i’m loving it!!</Text><Rate>5< /Rate><user>107592490609386394261</user></record></dataset><record>

Ordering experience was a little different than a typical restaurant, but the employees are very helpful and polite. The man who assisted me, Chaisson, made the experience much less intimidating. The food was amazing though a little pricy, but I'd recommend this place to anyone.</Text>

The "owner" of this establishment will soon be deported for his incompetence. The lack of customer service is baffling. If you are hungry please visit the many other surrounding restaurants. Thank you & god bless.</review>

I am livid about my visit this evening to your restaurant in Oxnard.  I was excited to pick up dinner after a long mountain bike ride and take it home to Ojai. I have enjoyed food in the Los Angeles location and was so happy to find it in Oxnard.

First, I was told by the nice man behind the counter that he was out of cole slaw.  It was shortly after 9pm and online the hours were until 11pm but he said they changed them to 10, and they actually have "last call" at 9:30?? Honestly, I was pretty upset as that is the only reason I fell in love with the sweet/spicy sausage sandwich (the coleslaw being the sweet). I finally relented to taking it without, against my better judgement.   For some reason, it took OVER 15 minutes to prepare my food even though I was the only customer.  Weird.

I finally get home with my food and find I have only TWO of the THREE sausages that I paid for.  No coleslaw and gypped out of a dog. I will NEVER return.< /text>

This place is pretty dang good and Landon and Ben, our chefs and servers, were knowledgable and quite courteous. Get the Kalbi Poutine, you won't leave hungry!
Also, the KFC(Korean Fried Chicken) is better than the colonel, I swear.<//Text>

<Text>Super happy we finally tried this place. The servings were huge, the food was delicious and the staff was friendly in a genuine way without being overbearing. The breakfast felt very home style and the dining area was clean and inviting. I got the French toast plate (took more than half home) and my husband got the pigs in a blanket (sausages wrapped in crepes). Can't wait to take visiting family there for breakfast in a few weeks.<//Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMguU83lXPb1apOoDEabk-oMuVvUsas7pC9NXp9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPpZg7wBC7btYMhfG6wRGJcereD0PkPv0EZU-hu=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures>< Resp>

A bed in breakfast feel with speed of McDonald's. The coffee is drinkable black however they do have flavored creamers upon request. The food has an expected level of grease covering which the flavor reflects. The waffles are soft and spongy with a promanent vanilla flavor. The syrup being served warm is a nice touch. The eggs were fluffy and as is expected for a hometown restaurant. The bacon was thin and crisp, sausages were satisfactory if not a little bland, and the country potatoes were a little bland and needed more cooking in my opinion. Service too is fast and has a get and go feel to it as service is often gone before you finish your request. Speaking as fast as they do may correct this. The atmosphere is quaint and has a small town feel. The decor is charming and worth a visit if you enjoy a small town restaurant. Expect to spend 10-12 dollars a plate.<//Text>

<Review>Mine and my wife's first time in and it was awesome. I had the chili verda omelette and my wife had the All American Breakfast and it was great. The staff was very nice and helpful in letting us know what was good. We will DEFINITELY be coming back. Ellen was our server and was very attentive. Thanks for a good meal and good experience.</Review><rating>4< /rating><Pictures>None<//Pictures><userid>100777619368850882260<//userid></record></dataset><record>

Husband and myself came here, for the first time.  We were seated, and couldn't help but notice the beratement from the supervisor over our waitress.  She was loud, rude, and completely out of line with our help.  Whatever it was that our waitress did, does not belong in the public eye.  No one deserves to be treated in such a disturbing way.  Our food was acceptable and our server was completely fair, and couldn't be more congenial.  There are other jobs that are available for this sweet woman, without the inhuman environment.</Text>

It appears they are no longer part of the "Country Waffles" Empire and are now an independent breakfast and lunch spot named "Waffles". The food is good. A new menu with new names for the meals. Some items are similar or the same as before. Coffee is ok.<//Review>

Food here is pretty good. I had an excellent chicken fried steak, a few days later I ordered it again and it was still same great taste but a little too crunchy. The hashbrowns are big slices of potatoes. Portions are proportionate to price.<//Text>

<Review>We were there for breakfast.  Great service, sausage patty was a little bland, but otherwise good. Biscuit and gravy is top notch, as are the pancakes, and the house salsa.</Review>< Rate>

<text>Worst service ever. It took 20 mins for our order to be taken  ( we had to ask for our order to be taken) and 20 for our food to get to the table. We had to share a napkin, and silverware. By the time we got our food, it was time to go. Waitresses arguing in the back on top of that. Horrible!!< /text>< Pics>

If you don't close til 3pm, you shouldn't treat new customers as if they're not welcome at 2:40. Very disrespectful to me & whoever owns the business who's providing you a paycheck through the paying customers you're supposed to WELCOME into their business. We'll never return to try this place again.< /Text>

Great thrift shop with current fashion set up like  a boutique coupled with cute stationary, jewelry & gifts. Clothing is organized by size then color, the perfect way to shop! Great selection of boots, and athleisure as well. They buy clothing, but I haven't tried to sell anything so can't comment on that. Make sure you go upstairs!!< /text>

This is one of the best resale shops I've been into. It's just cool and affordable. Better for women by far, as they have a lot of options. Mens options are quite limited, but still good clothes and fashion. Lots of fun, quirky gifts. Highly recommend.<//text>

<rate>5<//rate><review>Well-curated combination of thrift store and gift shop. Women's clothes take the majority but there's a very decent guy section with quality stuff. Seriously, look at the labels and you can find deals. The store itself is a cooler layout than most--two stories with a sweeping staircase going up. Changing rooms on both floor. They buy clothes too and the best deal is for store credit. If you sell, think "next season's stuff".< /review>< pics>

We appreciate you selling with us and we always try to sell items at the highest price we think we are able to sell the item for. We typically price items for approximately a third of their retail value depending on their brand, style, and condition of the item. We also encourage sellers to ask any questions they may have during the buying process at the buying counter. At the end of the buying process, sellers are always welcome to review the items we take and to keep any items if our prices don't work for them.\n\nThanks again for the feedback and have a great day,\nKnimble Management"}< /Response>

<Review>completly degrading experience for way underpaying as most people are desperate for funds when theyre selling clothes and have no choice but to accept offer.  i come across many nice designers but will NEVER offer them to this place again 👌🏼< /Review></record>

<Text>It is unusal for used clothing shops to sort their clothes by size, probably because of the labor involved. But Knimble sorts their clothes by size and *then* arranges them rack by rack in a rainbow. I liked the dressing room arrangement, and the upstairs was a little warm but the light from the skylights was lovely.</Text></record></dataset><record>

There is a market for this place.  From what I can tell, pretty good quality selections for women.  A bit less so for men but if you visit often you could bump into a gem.  New arrivals frequently due to nature of buy, sell, trade business.< /Review>

We just want to say that Eaves, Union City customer service is fantastic and they really want to help their customers during the covid times. Mary and Matt were very helpful to us during our leasing process. They are very kind and understanding of individual situations. We are very satisfied with working with them and would love to stay here again in future. You will be very happy to find a place to stay in this wonderful community!</review>

I recently moved here, the moving process was very quick and the management is very quick to respond all your concerns (Thank you Matt!!). As for the apartment,  it is old and the appliances too but they are in good conditions. Our unit is very spacious and has a lot of storage which is awesome! So far it’s a great community.< /Review>

Can’t say enough on how helpful Mat has been through the entire process of renting a unit from Eaves. He has been more than happy to assist me in anyway that I need help. The owners need to consider giving this dude a raise. He has made the process as smooth as possible, especially w me coming from out of state to move to Union City. Would definitely recommend this place to people.<//Text>

This place is alright. Easy to walk everywhere. I had a problem with a neighbor while the office as eating lunch @ 12pm. Yet the maintenance manager, Kelvin, sort it out right away. Good people.<//Text>

<Text>The buildings are cheaply renovated. They make you agree to cover the majority of your floors with rugs. Cars double park blocking other cars in the evening. Close to grocery stores. Management is nice and attentive to service requests.< /Text>< pictures>

I would like to give major props to Kelvin and the maintenance team for taking care of the property and our apartment. Service requests are done in a timely manner and the property’s consistently kept clean. You can tell the maintenance team along with Katrina and the consultants really do care about this property.

Along with that, Eaves is definitely a great place to live at, location-wise. You’re within walking distance of various food spots/grocery stores and the BART station. It’s generally a pretty quiet area as well so that helps if you’re someone who’s concerned about noise.

Me and my boyfriend have been living here for the past few months now. With it being our first apartment, we’ve been pretty happy with how our stay and experience has been so far.</Text>

<Pictures>None</Pictures><text>We've been living at eaves Union City for almost a year now and we had such a great experience because of Katrina Gaasterland and the staff. Katrina has been extremely supportive and helpful by being available on call at any point of time during the day (including weekends). I can easily say that she is one of the prime reasons that we chose to stay on in the community, beyond a year.

The service staff is very responsive. They made everything so much easy for us as they have always been super understanding and helpful, as all our service requests were taken care of super fast.

The Bart station, banks and grocery stores and best of all - the Asian restaurants are close by, which makes it super comfortable for day to day activities.< /text>< Date>

Dilapidated and dirty, this place has appliances from 1980 that are repaired with tape. Some repairs 3 times 1 week for same problem. They are too cheap to actually address issue of the out of date appliances and decor and instead as the expression goes put lipstick on a pig.<//Review>

<review>Service requests are always quick. Their ticketing systems works very smoothly. Glad they take precautions during COVID-19 and management is ALWAYS communicating through email, no parking issues ever only when we first moved in multiple people would park in our carport but management always sent multiple emails about towing if they did not move. The security is also great and responsive.<//review>< rate>

I booked an appointment and cancelled 2 of my meetings and drove 45 min and the lady over the phone said that they do not have any apartments to see. Instead of at least apologizing or acknowledging the mistake, she argued that appointment confirmation email is actually from a Robot. I double checked the email and there is no sign that it is sent via Robot. Even if it is from a Robot, why to schedule an appointment in first place? Attaching the email for reference. Now I see there are similar feedback reports from others and looks like they neglect this voluntarily. I wonder how they treat the residents. Wasted 2 hours of time. Not at all professional.</Text>

The leasing office staff have all been very helpful and quick to respond to any issues that have come up and even before moving in when we were interested in getting more information and scheduling a tour. I love that they are pet friendly. Our pup had a tough transition moving homes the first couple weeks but everyone was very understanding and offered any help to make it easier for us. I’ve recommended Eaves to a few people one of which has decided to move in after touring and seeing for themselves. I appreciate the precautions they have in place for COVID such as pool usage by appointment after screening and closure of the fitness center. I hope they are able to open up the fitness center soon so I can try it out. I like that they are offering alternatives such as FREE online classes for fitness, cooking, crafts, etc. And other virtual social events like bingo night and trivia games in place of in person events they used to have pre-covid. I’m looking forward to being able to participate in more events.< /text>< gmapID>

<Text>I didn’t live here but I just tried to schedule a visit using the website which is an option available because I tried to get in contact with them by email but nobody called back. I scheduled it then I got a phone call from someone in the management saying that it’s an automated system but she will give me a call the day after. She didn’t call but I received a long email from someone called sidney F which should be management assistant as per the signature confirming my visit Appointment and that there’s a unit available to be seen. I took time off work and drove there and then surprise there’s no unit to be seen. The girl at the management excuse was that i told you it’s an automated system.

The bottom line these people are using an automated system to do business for them that they don’t have control on and they are not responsible for it under the excuse that It’s an automated system. They don’t care about your time at all. I didn’t live there but just trying to save someone else time. I don’t think they care about these reviews even.

<rate>1<//rate><review>Worst ever management experience probably in whole US! Strictly a “NO-NO” unless you have lot of money to waste.
Considering the Avalon property we signed a 13 month lease and moved in based on a virtual tour from Mid East course. After a 3 day drive we arrived an apartment that was old (on virtual tour we were shown a new apartment), apartment smelled bad, carpet was not even clean, apartment had roach and spiders (spider bites left marks all over our body and every single night was a struggle to sleep due to bites). We were told they can call a professional to clean the carpet (which means they did not had a professional cleaner clean the carpet before our move-in as it had spots on the carpet) but when we moved out they took all our security deposit and on asking they mention that if you do not enrol in their clean sweep program for $100, you will be charged $150-$200 for a professional cleaning (something that wasn’t communicated to us prior) we gave the apartment as it is and cleaned it as we had used for a about a month (we had not used any storages in the apartment as we had decided to move out, had no furniture, only kitchen, bathroom and room just to sleep was used so one can imagine the usage in the apartment. For a week for food we did a carry out so no cooking. Weekends we spent out as we did not like being the apartment. For everything we were miscommunicated and every time you call leasing office they ask to call customer care regarding your billing and you speak to customer care they have no idea what charges are done to your account. So basically a f*****d up management who just want to make money. For our stay of about a month, there was never cleaning done outside the apartment, not even clean on the day we moved in. Every time you open door, leaves and dirt came along. When you want to move in, leasing office will respond to you for everything, from your payments to everything. And once you move in, they don’t handle payments and you keep going back and forth between customer service and leasing office. We regret everyday moving in Eaves. Doesn’t even deserve 1 star but have to to post our experience. Really frustrating experience dealing with these people. They just show so much concern but they are least bothered about anything other than money. Please do not get tempted by their offers. It is worth paying bit more somewhere else than live here.< /review><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None<//Response><Gmap_id>0x808fbfd8c47ef1df:0x3a71ef89d542575a< /Gmap_id></record>

<Review>Hi, so I have been living here about 5 months and so far no real complaints. The area is clean, pretty quiet for apartment living, the Amenities are pretty good, pools are clean and don’t ever get too crowded. The maintenance guys are on point response time is actually impressive, same day! The property manager is really nice addresses items quickly and professionally!<//Review>< Pics>

Location location location, this apartment complex is close to many stores, restaurants and gas stations at walking distance and very good School district.

Management are very professional, Thanks to Michael and Katrina for helping me and family with a very smooth process on completing all paperwork and getting everything ready.

The apartment is really nice, needed a few things fixed upon our arrival but maintenance arrived as we scheduled on our request.

Pool area is really nice and clean., Laundry site is spacious and well ventilated.

Not giving a 5 star rating because the landscaping could be better, there are several bald spots next to the sidewalks, and not a fan of using a key fob or remote on opening the main gate to access the complex (would be easier with a barcode / scanner).

Overall, a very nice place to live</Text>

So far, my experience living at Eaves Union City has been a very positive one for myself and my partner. We love how safe the community and the neighborhood. I also appreciate that the community is smoke-free. The maintenance team is always on top of things and get to fixes immediately, most often on the same day. As a regular user of the fitness center I have a couple of requests: a water fountain and perhaps a curl bar rack. Other than that - it's been great! We can definitely see ourselves living here in this apartment community for a few more years. Happy holidays!<//review>

<review>Eaves is better for summer. Winter is horrible here. Heaters vent is very small in bedroom so the living room is much warm and bedroom remains little colder. Also heater makes much noise. It makes life worse with babies. Although maintenance requests are addressed promptly, equipments are faulty and we have raised requests for heaters, gas stove, boilers multiple times. Equipments are not replaced but they repair it and it becomes faulty very soon. Little pricy for the old apartment and faulty equipments. Requesting for little renovation.< /review></record>

We appreciate you bringing your concerns to our attention."}<//Response><review>I have been living at eaves for about two years now. I have enjoyed the convenient location in the Bay Area and (initial) affordability. The rent cost has steadily increased and I am currently looking elsewhere to rent as there are newer/remodeled units in the area at comparable rates. Everything else about the community is great - the maintenance staff, cleanliness, office staff, online payment system, and various amenities. The only reasons for not 5 stars is the increase in rent (for one star) and the dated units without in-unit laundry (for the other star).< /review>< Pictures>

We love our apartment and the service! Sonia was absolutely amazing from the moment we started looking at the apartment to the inspection and moving in! We love our location too - I work in SF and it is a quick walk to BART, as well as to many restaurants and grocery stores. Parking is usually a huge issue in apartments but here we have not had a problem at all for guest parking. Thank you eaves Union City!</Text>

Eaves Union city is a nice place to live in, it`s a gated community and convenient as well specially for those who commute by taking Bart.
The place is quiet and centrally located, staff is friendly and helpful specially Sonia who take care of everything very well and gives you heads up for any upcoming event or work that need to be done in the community.
I like definitely extend my stay if I get a good deal for the next year as well :-)< /review>

Have been living in this apartment for almost 3 years. Its really a nice gated community in a great location !!

Location:
Surrounded by Safeway,Indian grocery shops,Banks,Restaurants,Pizza shops,Rite Aid,UPS store,gas stations,bus station n near to BART.

Community:
It has covered parking facility for the residents and a lot of guest parking space.
The kids play area here is good but it would have been better if there is a swing and also the wood chips are replaced by foam as the ground cover material to ensure even more safety to kids.
The fitness center and the swimming pools are well maintained .
It would have been great if there is  in-unit laundry facility.

Management:
The staffs here are very very  responsive as well as friendly ,which makes me to select this apartment from the YELP reviews and it is 100% true..!
Thanks to Sonia n Brandon.
They have a dedicated website for residents to pay the rent on-line ,to submit any service requests. And they have a 24 hour emergency service request line too !

Maintenance:
The maintenance team here rocks !! Very quick turnaround time !!
Thanks to Vincent,Troy n Kevin ..< /Text>

I've lived at eaves for the past two years and have enjoyed my time in the complex overall. Everything is very well-maintained and clean. Maintenance and office staff are always super friendly and responsive. We've had issues with various loud neighbors/pets over the multiple tenants that have lived around us, but that's to be expected with apartment living. The apartments are pretty standard, with a good amount of space (we live in a 2-bedroom unit with two people and a dog). If we do decide to move out, it will be to look for a place that's more updated with a few more amenities, like in-unit laundry and remodeled kitchens. Those are the few things that are missing that would make this place better and well-worth the rent! Avalon seems like a great management company that cares about its tenants and we would hope to find the same treatment at their other complexes!</text>

My fiancé & I have been at the eaves for almost 6 months now. This review is long overdue, We enjoy living here very much.  I have family and friends who have lived at Avalon & Eaves, I have frequented properties and am very familiar with them.
The eaves union city is a great place to live,the property is nice looking, gated, amenities (such as pools,gym, and community nights where we bbq or have food) are a great addition to living at the eaves. At the eaves they have a lot of  visitor parking, friendly neighbors, lots of garbage cans that are easy to access, the are eco friendly (compost!) Pet friendly(even though we don’t have any) I enjoy seeing them around. You are walking distance to Safeway, Asian, Indian markets, dollar tree, daiso & Bart ( great for tech company workers who take the shuttle)
When you decide The Eaves is for you, check out their website, look at some floor plans & call/email to set up a tour! The process after tour was easy peasy, after deciding The Eaves would be our home, We went through all necessary paperwork and Megan & Brandon made the process go effortlessly. Once I got that call from Brandon saying the apartment was ours was the greatest feeling (I wanted to scream for excitement) After living here I can leave an honest review and say that any time I need anything, the office & maintinence staff is attentive, fast and courteous. If you have a issue with the complex or apartment log online and fill out a work order. The grounds are upkeeped weekly, the place seems to be in tip top shape, no complaints here... Only one I can think of is the trees in the back leave a lot of trees and maybe some weird sap on your car.  So don’t hesitate to come by and take a look at the apartments!</text>

This place is awesome. The best breakfast I've had in a long time. Like since before Chuck's moves kinda good.

Price is very reasonable. 2 very large OJs, coffee, Chicken Fried Steak w/hashbrowns, and a all meat 3egg omelet w/hashbrowns came to just over $20. Portions filled the plate full. And we got over food in less than 10min!

Food comes on paper plates (no muss no fuss) but if you're coming here you shouldn't be expecting fine China in the first place.

The staff was very friendly. We will be coming back many more times in the future :)< /Review>

The owner is very rude whenever you decide to change an order. The food was nothing like what I wanted it it was cold and it didn't have anything that I had ordered. In fact it had less I was very disappointed this last time the old owners used to make the food perfect and with love Now there is no love and it Aint country no more.<//Review>

Thought they had closed. Hadn't been here in years. Burger good, service friendly, fries undercooked. Next time will order them crispy. Can't wait to try their chicken.<//review>

<Text>Food and prices are great, breakfast menu needs expanding. Most of all the place needs a good sprucing up and fingerprints cleaned off windows, door and interior surfaces. Overall good for dining but not as enticing for if you want to go sit down with the family and eat.</Text>< pictures>

<Review>Hole in the wall.  Probably been here 100 years. Laugh... but, sweet Asian lady took my order.  Food came out SUPER FAST and everything was fresh.... EXCEPT... it is OBVIOUSLY NOT homemade country gravy.  The fact is 99% of restaurants/diners who serve 'white country gravy', DO NOT MAKE IT THEMSELVES.  Most use a powder that makes a gravy when added to liquid.  It's a shame too, cuz it would have taken my great breakfast to OVER THE TOP AMAZING if they took the time to make homemade gravy.  Sad face.  But regardless...
Everything was good. WILL BE BACK@!<//Review><Date>1543508185451</Date><Rating>5<//Rating>< response>

<Rating>1< /Rating><Date>1531442581853< /Date><text>Ordered Philly cheese steak sandwich. Wish I would have took a picture. Nasty, tasteless, and definitely not worth the $6.99 price. My friend ordered Western burger n said it taste frozen. Milkshakes were only little cold and not much flavor. Very disappointed because I remember this place being very good and loved their pastrami sandwiches. Which they no longer serve.</text>< username>

< review>
The cook never say's much but she always will greet good morning if she looks up and she Definitely is a great cook all the other owners were ok but these owners cleaned it up improved the food tremendously have been going in there for 25 years I quit going there years ago because food was bad and the place was filthy. then one day about a year ago decided to try again. the lady that takes orders is great and the guy that brings food to your table Is polite and courteous, great owners, i am blessed every time i go in there they are super friendly always "see you next time" and always thanks you on the way out, great folks.<//review>

DON'T EAT AT COUNTRY BOYS ON FREMONT STREET! they switch owners 3 months ago and the owner serviced us bad meat, lettuce, thousand island dressing, deep fried zucchini and ice cream that tasted like frozen milk! I miss the old owner. My food got me vomiting so beware what the new owner did to a good place oh and they forgot to give me cheese and charged me for it! I paid $18.21 for all of that! :'(<//Text>

<review>Country Boys in a last vestige of the old drop in drive-ins. There used to be a sister drive-in on Country Club Drive for many years, but it closed down. The "Country-Pak" hamburger special (cheeseburger, krinkle fries, and soda) is the go-to item you must try.</review>< user>

I rarely leave reviews but I love how knowledgeable they were and how amazing I was treated. They sifted through their used gear with me,heard my problem and then recommended I talk to the boot fitter, who turned out to be the best fitter I ever had. Asked lots of questions, listened, tested ideas with many tests and checks, and then made changes. Wow I'm so a fan of this store!! I had Great experience!< /Text>

<review>This place is my absolute favorite place to do business with locally. They will work with you to help you get the gear you need. They have a fantastic brand selection and will help you order things directly from the manufacturer. I have been boot fitted and had custom footbeds made. They mounted my bindings as well as consulted me on boots, bindings and skis. Very knowledgeable. They are more than a ski shop, the have the best selection of snowboards and splits in town. They appreciate 12 packs so hook em up.<//review>< Pics>

I purchased a Trek e-bike there a few years back and I absolutely love that I can now ride with my husband. They have repaired my paddle board and we use them for all our mountain bike maintenance.  We bought a bunch of backcountry gear this year and they were super helpful.  The owners are great people and part of the community which is important to me.  Keep up the good work.</review>< pictures>

< review>
Based on previous reviews I was pretty excited to check out this place and hopefully find some boots for my skiis I just bought. Even as I was about to ask I asked the couple guys shoveling snow from the sidewalk in front if I could park there. First guy was like, yea ok, but the other guy just gave me this look and started shaking his head. So I nicely asked if they preferred me parking elsewhere and they pointed me across the street, fine no biggie. Next, I walk in and there are 4 guys at the checkout and I ask if they have used ski boots as I’m just getting into skiing and don’t want to spend a fortune on something yet. They point me upstairs, I ask if any of the 4 guys could help me out, and they say “we only help with new purchases.” Then one of the guys helps me at least size my foot, but no one came in the 40 min I was looking for an appropriate boot to help. I never found anything in my size under $400 used, so I decided I’d at least rent for the day. Guy was helpful in setting up the rental, but when I went to check out, the guy at the counter said it was $35 for the rental and $10 for the helmet. Literally 30 seconds ago the guy setting up the rental had said the helmet was $5 and earlier someone in the store said a basic rental was $30 for everything. More so I checked online before I even came To the shop because I knew there was a possibility that I may have to rent. Online it said it was $30 as well. The guy at the register said, "It's always been $35 and 10" then said he'd make an exception this one time. Their website still has it at $30 at the time of this post. He made it seem like I was being cheap and unreasonable to ask for the price that I was told and posted. It might sound like I'm cheap, but I don't think anything I asked for was unreasonable from a shop wanting someone's business. I saw a few customers in there later when I was returning and they seemed to be very nice to them since they were buying $1000s of dollars worth of gear. So if you're looking for good customer service only go here if money is not an issue for you, unfortunately that's not the case for me. Finally, maybe my fault, but I skiied on a powdery day, but the bindings were adjusted way too loose so my skiis detached every time they had any powder over them and I could barely ski. Probably mostly my fault but I think they could have set them up a little better. Aside from one guy who helped set up the rental and one guy who was kinda sorta helpful with boot fitting, this whole place had the attitude that they were too cool to help me. Will not recommend to friends or ever return. Also I try to support local shops but not when they have this attitute. Will get what I need from REI this time.<//review>

<text>Thanks for a fantastic experience! We were mostly served by Quincy who was knowledgeable, friendly, patient and gave us the best options for snowboards, boots and bindings. We really appreciate Quincy's patience and service while trying on many pairs of boots. My partner's boots have been great since the first slide! Thanks again and would definitely recommend this great shop!<//text>< Pics>

Great service, very knowledgeable staff. The selection is the best in town. If your looking for winter gear this is the only place you need to go. And they are the only shop on the river, they started renting ducky’s for floating the Truckee and it’s so fun!<//Review>

<pictures>None< /pictures><text>Upon entering this business, I had followed all their requirements by wearing a mask and making sure there wasn't more than 10 customers in the store. The store clerk asked if there was anything he could help me with and I said I just wanted to look around. He said to me, "we are only interested in people who are more focused." I thought this was rude. He included, "since we are not that busy you can come in." So, put that on your requirement list and put prices on the sun glasses so customers don't have to bother you for the price. Your attitude will continue to push people away. I've purchased glasses from you before but the internet is not rude so I won't be back an I'll get them online instead.< /text>< username>

After crowds of people browsing the store over the 4th of July weekend and a very real spike in cases in Truckee, we made the difficult decision of adding extra precautions to keep our staff safe and keep our store open and available to customers that need to pick something up. Executing these precautions is obviously clunky and something we need to do better with.  Your experience in the first few days shows us that we really need to refine our approach, because the last thing we want to do is turn off our customers. These are strange times as business owners and our employees are trying to navigate them for the first time. Please accept our sincere apology and know we will try to do better.'}< /Resp>< time>

Fantastically kind, helpful, and experienced boot fitters. Love that they have a selection of used & last year's boots upstairs. Would refuse to go anywhere else in CA for either top of line or affordable boots & skis.
They are starting to get busy so expect a wait and some juggling.< /Text>

<text>This was the first gear shop I stepped foot into when I moved to Truckee, almost a decade ago. Though the name has changed, along with the layout, (both even better than before, may I add) one thing has stayed constant; A kickass core of knowledgeable, friendly, badass staff. When it comes to sporting goods, Wrenn and Rob know exactly what you need and they deliver above and beyond. Snow, water sports, disc golf, bike..you name it, it’s there. All for the right price, to boot! Don’t hesitate, if you need gear, or even just have a question, go to the Tahoe Sports Hub. They’ve got you.

The best gear, highly trained/skilled staff and a location that makes popping in a breeze. This shop is where you want to go for your skiing, mtn biking and paddle board needs. They always have the best prices and the level of service is top-notch. When your shopping for gear you want to be confident in your purchase, the Sports Hub will dial you in and you will be telling your friends about this amazing shop.<//Review>

Great set up and nice prices for half day rental. However rider BEWARE. Not all rentals have bike chain guard. My fault as well for not noticing, but, bike completely ruined my 100$ hiking pants i needed for next activity. And for fall weather not uncommon to wear long pants. I asked upon return about bike guards and how chains completely ruined my pants and all i got was "bummer" . 25$, 2 hours of fun was not worth throwing 100$ down drain<//Text>

Fantastic, patient, helpful staff. Came in late in the day at the end of the summer season, hoping to find some trail shoes to use since I left mine home in Chicago. The salesman brought out about half a dozen options for me to try, none of which worked, because some sizes were out due to the fact it's the end of the season. He then spent a good 20 minuted going through miscellaneous closeout shoes with me. I honestly think I wanted him to "get the sale" more than he did -- he was just being helpful. Finally, he suggested I try one last pair from display, and -- amazingly - they were perfect. Thanks to his persistence and expertise, I got a great pair of shoes, and was able to enjoy several phenomenal hiking trails during our vacation.< /Text>

I avoided the Sports Hub for quite awhile, since the parking was always challenging.  They recently purchased the property across the street and now parking is a breeze.  I recently had the opportunity to ski with a local professional skier and a ski manufacturing executive, they both said this was the place to go in Truckee.  I wanted to upgrade my touring set-up, which was pretty old.  I got a complete new set-up, the boot fitting is top-notch.  I also had an issue with the skis I initially bought, nothing wrong with the ski except it didn't preform the way I had anticipated (my bad).  Rob was very reasonable about let me exchange for a reasonable price.  I can't say enough positive things!<//Text>

The RUDEST people work here. My first time skiing and I asked to rent all gear necessary And the recommended the basic package which “included everything” for skiing and they did not bother to tell me I needed a helmet. When I called afterwards to ask them about It they said It was my problem and I was in the store so I should’ve asked for It. He said a bunch of people ski without helmets so it’s up to me to ask? I did not see one person at Northstar without a helmet. Do yourself a favor and don’t rent from here. They don’t care about their customers or business for that matter because they have the worst attitude.< /text>

I've lived in Truckee for 14 years and Tahoe Sports Hub is my favorite gear store. Every one of their staff is super friendly and helpful. Somehow they've avoided the trap of bro-brah attitude so common in gear stores and are always kind and go out of their way to help you. Their boot fitting is also amazing!</Text>

Hard to recommend. They just don’t have enough people to help. We sat there for 10 minutes just needing someone to grab a certain shoe size for my son and it was apparent we could have sat there for 30 min without any help.</Text>

I dropped off a set of skis on my way out of town to have them repaired and couldn't be happier with the speed and service from Tahoe Sports Hub!  I couldn't get the repair I needed in Indiana and TSH was more than willing to complete the repairs and ship to me.  Thank you to the TSH team!</Review>

<Review>Great service, super knowledgeable and friendly staff that has a great deal of expertise in the many facets of outdoor adventures. I went in for a new pair of boots after 15 years..my old boots had spent almost as much time getting “just the right fit” in a rice cooker as I felt I had time on the mountain. After 6 foot surgeries and a fused ankle and toe I was worried. New boots fit like a charm, Bob and Cory worked on me and I skied better than ever and feet fine after a half day of laps! No pressure points, great fit and adjustments. They really spend the time getting it right.</Review>< response>

<user_id>111258218105828278241< /user_id><Review>I rented a splitboard from Tahoe Sports Hub by filling out the online form. I had called ahead of time to confirm the rental and they said it would be available to go at 8 AM the day of my rental, since I wanted to get on the trail ASAP. When I arrived at the shop the day of my rental around 10 AM, they told me it would take an hour to set up the board to the right specs. They could have asked my setup when I had called to confirm on the phone or just make a place for it on the online form. They almost forgot to give me the poles. The board was not waxed. The technician made sure to explain how the bindings worked to my boyfriend and not me and my small woman brain. Definitely lost an hour of daylight to play in the snow.< /Review>< GmapID>

This is one of the best shops I've ever lived near. Knowledgeable and helpful employees, great brands, prices, and variety. They rent pretty much everything you'd ever need (even climbing shoes), and were so helpful when I needed to warranty defective gear once. Staff members clearly love to play outside and want to help you enjoy yourself too. Thanks!</Text>

<Review>They helped both me and my husband find snowboard boots more comfortable than we'd have ever imagined snowboard boots could be. I also purchased a board here but after riding it for 2 days I was rather unhappy with it. They offered me multiple options of which I chose to exchange it for a different board and receive a refund for the price difference as store credit. Great customer service, extremely knowledgeable staff, and good prices, too.<//Review>< Pics>

Fantastic service and great people to work with.  My wife and I just moved to Truckee from North Carolina, and I needed new skis and boots.  We did a little research and ended up at Tahoe Sports Hub.  Rob was incredibly helpful and really took the time to talk us through our options and understand what we wanted to do with our new gear and steered us in the right direction.  After that, Corey spent 30 minutes doing a custom fitting for my new boots that has to be experienced to be believed - he is (by far) the most thorough and knowledgeable fitter I have ever worked with.  Yesterday we hit the slopes for the first time with our new gear, and could not have been happier with the end results.  Highly recommend these guys - they will treat you right and are great folks to deal with.</text>

<Review>Best ski rental experience! I typically get really bad shin pain from poor fitting rental boots and am extra picky about comfort (I know I should probably just get my own custom fit boots but I don't ski enough!). Shawn was so patient with me and put me in a well padded boot with no pressure points, just snug comfort all around. He was very knowledgeable and informative about my gear. He made a few tweaks to get the most comfort possible out of a rental (like putting sole inserts in and cutting them to size to fit my foot!). I also never touched a buckle on my boots! He did everything for me! I walked out with practically new boot rentals (and new ski rentals). The price was cheaper than the first place I went to (a more popular ski rental store in town) and they didn't give me half the service that Shawn did at SportsHub. So happy I came here and am confident that the boots he put me in will be comfy on the slopes. Thank you, Shawn, for excellent service!!!! Go to SportsHub if you are picky like me!!</Review><gmap_id>0x809bdfbf7dd19c03:0xccd323561489bb5f</gmap_id>< Rate>

<Text>Awesome service! I was shopping for the TREW Chariot Bib, Rob answered the phone and was incredibly helpful. He found the exact size and color I was looking for and then shipped them to me the same day. He made the whole process really easy. I'd highly recommend this shop to anyone looking for great customer service, product selection and a knowledgeable, friendly staff.< /Text>< UserId.>

These guys are great! Not only do they carry quality gear, but they're knowledgable. They're actually the ones out there doing the sports at a high level, and consequently have an intimate knowledge of the products. I've been very happy with all my purchases there, and their excellent customer service. Great locally owned shop!!</review>

<Text>I am mystified by the 4.7 rating. I have twice been disappointed in their quality of service.  The first was a simple tune up and wax for my board. When I picked it up, it looked as though they had not done a thing to it.  One would think the guy handing it back to me would notice the poor job, since they are the “experts”.  He could care less.
The second time was just today.  The steel cable that tightens my snowboard boot snapped.  They told me it would be done “sometime today”.  I happened to look up the replacement job on YouTube and discovered it is a 5 minute fix!  The final insult was the cost they quoted me...”20 to 30 dollars”.
Bottom line, this shop clearly preys on their customers,  has no concern for quality and zero interest in customer service.  Oh, and they gouge their customers on equipment sales by at least 20%. Take your business elsewhere.<//Text>< pictures>

{'time': 1514566945876, 'text': 'Hi Jerome,\nWe feel we need to address parts of your review as untrue. We take pride in our tuning, but if you were unhappy we will gladly re-tune your board for free or refund the price of your tune.\n\nA BOA replacement usually takes 30 minutes to complete properly. You were specifically quoted $20 then the owner subsequently offered you $10 over the phone because you were upset. The price is simply dependent on time, some are easy fixes and some take a long time to get right. We try to give every customer the best service and the fastest turnaround possible. December 28th is one of the busiest days of the year we are sorry we  weren’t able to complete your repair while you waited, but promised to call you as soon it was completed.\n\nLastly,  we price all of our equipment at MAP ( minimum advertised price) the lowest price we are legally allowed. AND we price match the internet and any other shop in the area. So, to say we gouge people is simply untrue.\n\nWe hope you were able to get your boot fixed and back out on the hill. If you still need it repaired bring it by the shop and we will happily help you out. Happy New Year.'}<//resp>

I read the reviews and thought we would find some help here for beginner climbers. What we found was some grumpy guys, not all that impressed that we weren't expert climbers. When we told them we were going up the mountaineers route at Whitney, their first comment was, "What, the East Buttress?" We said, no, just the regular mountaineers route, through the Chute, their interest in us dropped significantly. We didn't stay that long after. I am sure they are really good here for experts, but if you are a beginner, get your advice elsewhere.< /Review>

We want all of our customers to leave our shop excited for their next adventure and are so sorry you didn't have that experience. We regularly send out first time climbers and help beginner climbers build their gear quivers and acquire local knowledge and we take great pride in doing so.  Introducing customers to a new sport or seeing someone discover the passion we feel for a sport is one of the best things about working in this industry.

Kenny is one of the good ones. Super technically informed but also able to break down ideas in a way inexperienced riders can understand. He can talk to me about sidecut and core materials, and teach me a thing or two about how to anchor my boot laces for customization of flex; but he can also walk a complete beginner through the process of deciding on a board.

I've been in a bunch and just observed them with customers, and the rest of the staff is great. Really helpful without being annoying or overbearing. Bonus, they seem to focus on staffing and supporting actual locals, not season-aire ski bums who aren't invested in the community and just looking to fund their lifestyle. I've met so many shop guys who're more interested in vibing out non-locals or maxing their commission than getting people stoked on riding, so being here is really refreshing.

They have some great boot fitters in shop. Good enough they can guarantee boot fit and will work on your boots life. Thankfully, I won't need that service on my new boots, they were able to get me pretty dialed from the outset. I have extraordinarily tough feet to fit (wide, narrow ankles, big calves), but they were able to get me set. A friend of mine wasn't able to get her boots solid after half a season, so TSH ultimately gave her a different pair. That's the kind of service that makes me pay the premium for brick-and-mortar, the the kind of service online and aggro shopkid board shops won't/can't give you.

Their demo fleet also runs super deep, and I will definitely be back later this season or next to try out a few things. They specialize in "snow surf" boards, and I reckon they have some of the best snow surfer stock in the country. High quality Japanese brands and very niche American brands, a great mix.

For my money, the best snowboard shop I've been to in either North or South Lake Tahoe, and I've been to most of them.<//Text><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

Top notch shop with a great selection and knowledgable friendly staff. We purchased two pairs of ski boots recently and they spent multiple hours over multiple days to tune and allign them to perfection for us. Corey is a high level boot fitter that i would highly recomend for skiers of any level!<//Text>

<review>The Sports Exchange is definitely THE place in Truckee to find the gear you need for the mountains, whether it's in bounds skiing, backcountry, or climbing in the summer. Unlike other backcountry oriented shop that I won't name, The Sports Exchange is down to earth and down to help you figure out what gear you need. I'm new in the climbing and backcountry scene, and these guys are there to help. They do great ski work too!</review><user_id>103512540198287293979<//user_id><username>Tommy Penick</username><pictures>None<//pictures>< gmapID>

Nice sports shop; you do save some money by renting equipment here, but the disadvantage is if it doesn't fit it's going to be difficult exchanging for the right size. The other downside is that there can be a wait and there's only a few parking spaces.</Review>

< review>
I am so upset. I called rose hills the first week of Mother Day and I asked them when I should remove the stuff from my moms gravesite. The lady I spoke to advised me that on the 20th all things had to be picked up. I asked her more than one time and she assured me that the pick up date was on the 20th. To my surpirse, I went yesterday to go pick up my moms stuff and they threw everything away. I started crying because I bought my mom so many cute things to decorate for Mothers Day. This shouldve not happened and it did because the lady on the phone gave me wrong information. It was about 300 dollars worth of stuff. Everything was brand new and I am so disappointed because I previously had given 5 stars.< /review>

I have been going to Rose Hills for over 30 years to visit family members that are buried there. My mother had more than 20 plots that she had owned for family. It’s sad to think that as much money as my mother has put into Rose Hills that the maintenance is not very well.  When I go visit them I have seen tire marks over their headstones, I have seen dried out burnt grass as if it’s not being watered, it’s not being trimmed regularly both vases on my father‘s plot have been completely buried and I have to cut the grass just to be able to take them out. One time the stone actually sank in on one side when we had heavy rain and it was completely almost buried and I had reported it twice to be fixed and removed in writing and it took over a year for them to do it. The staff members are not very friendly actually I can say they’re heartless. On holidays such as Christmas or Father’s Day, Mother’s Day they should have other entrances to the cemetery available not just one main gate open and that’s it. I was in line for over an hour just to get in. That cuts into the time that I get to spend with my loved ones who have passed on. Today we were actually approached and told that we were not able to put up a canopy to protect ourselves from the harmful rays of the sun not knowing that we could be skin cancer survivors. They don’t even have adequate restrooms for the visitors. You would think with all the money that they’re receiving and continue to expand that they would at least think about the family members and friends who visit their facility. At one point in my life I actually wanted to be buried there myself with my parents but after all that I have been through at Rosehills I will not put any of my family members through any of the stuff that I’ve gone through. And since Covid they have a big canopy with chairs set up on the road that I take to see my parents and I have to go all the way around now to see them because they blocked it off. I find that to be very inconsiderate if they’re going to have services out in the open then it shouldn’t block anyone from entering or exiting from seeing their love ones and I have to take a huge detour.< /text>

My Brother-in-law funeral was completed on Friday 3/12/2021, on behalf of the entire family, I want to thank everyone for your help during this most difficult time. I would like to specially thank pre-plan adviser Ms. Cecilia Chan who assisted our family from day one until the last moment of Mr. Tran laid to rest, Cecilia demonstrated a professional manner while assisting our family, every time there was a concern raised to her, she responded quickly and efficiently, she did an excellent job in working with us during this tough time, we are truly grateful and appreciated for her kindness and sympathy toward our family. Though I rated 4 stars in the review but Cecilia well deserves a 5 stars herself. I also would like to point out that the service in Alhambra arrangement office needs some improvement, busy busy and careless about the family's sorrow and grieving is not an appropriated excuse.</review>

Rose Hills has been amazing since my family had to bury my Mother 30 years ago. I had an issue about 3 years ago where my mom’s flower pot was buried so deep and they fixed it right away and mailed me a letter notifying me it was fixed.  I live in Arizona.  A couple months later I was out here again and my Mom’s headstone had sank quite a bit.  Again I notified them of the issue. Of course they stated as there policy if it was anything to do with the plot we are responsible for the payment to repair.  They fixed my moms and again mailed a letter stating that it was there fault from a broken sprinkler. It’s hard to loose the ones you love but you also have to remember these people work everyday with grieving families don’t make there jobs harder by being rude or nasty, just be kind because they will always work with you to take care of you no matter what, but they also have bills and employees to pay so yes there are costs to be covered.  Thank you Rose Hills for keeping my Mom safe and taken care of.< /Text>

Other than the fact that the mortician did my grandmother's lips too thin (but it got plumped) the funeral went off without a hitch. Also their find-a-grave system is great to find the right area since it's such a huge place. It's such a peaceful place and their chapel... their chapel at sunset...</review>

We have been going to this cemetery for about 32 years now. We clean and maintain 6 family stones. We constantly have to complain about the lawn being dry. But what's worse is the horrible job they do with the weed whackers. See for yourself in the pic's posted. I had a few conversations with the mgr and I don't get the lack of attention given to the work. I'm generally not a complainer but these stones may not matter to them but these are our family members. I hope things get better going forward.< /text>

<Review>The Rose Hills experience I received was not stellar. There were a number of things Rose Hills dropped the ball on in preparation for my husband's services. Despite providing specific instructions, photos & requests, I had to contact Rose Hills several times the day before my husband's service and after! They failed to have my husband ready for my personal viewing appointment that had been set WEEKS prior. When I finally got to see my husband, he was unshaven despite clearly requesting he be shaven & providing photos for reference! At the service. I was handed an envelope that was supposed to have my husband's hair clippings & fingerprints. The fingerprints were missing! I once again had to call & email Rose Hills to let them know they had misplaced my husband's fingerprints. I did receive the fingerprints in digital & physical form, but the physical prints are unlabeled. For the amount of money, I paid for my husband's services NONE of this should have happened! Rose Hills needs to give our deceased loved ones the care, attention & respect they deserve. I understand Rose Hills employees are doing the best they can during the pandemic but things like this makes me feel like he was just another number to you.</Review>< pics>

I buried both my parents at Rose Hills, my Mom in 2002 and my Dad in 2009 (The Grove Ext, plots 1104 & 1105). I visit them very frequently and manicure their area because the grounds maintenance does a very poor job. It’s pretty sad that I have to take with me my weed wacker, bin full of yard tools, water hose, etc etc. last week when I went to visit 5-19-21, my Moms plot was completely buried in mud, I filed a complaint with Rose Hills staff and was assured it would be taken care of. Today 5-25-21 I went back and the plot was still the same. I stopped a groundskeeper and asked why nothing had been done and he could not understand me speaking in English, he just said “GO OFFICE”. I then stopped Allied Security and asked for a office number I could call other than the one main number which kept me on hold for over an hour. The Security Guard also said that Rose Hills is so short handed that they (security) were tasked with replacing vases and various complaints. I have pictures of the tire tracks over my parents plots proving my complaint and will furnish upon request. I am seriously thinking about selling our other owned plots and buying elsewhere. ROSE HILLS  needs serious management restructuring!< /review>

My daughter was born in October 2020 and passed away two weeks later.  It is now mid April of 2021 and she still does not have a headstone, she is in an unmarked grave for over HALF A YEAR!!!  Emails are not being responded to by Angela Powell anymore, Brittany Madera has been telling me and my wife that it's the Marker department that is backed up.

Can anyone there help me and my wife out?

Everything was moving along until the Marker stage, this is taking way too long.</review>

<Review>Extremely sick of some of the employees attitude. I spoke to Veronica in The title's department, very taken back by her Horrible attitude, tone and overall experience. I had to speak to Grizelda who was great. A tip for Veronica, after burying Family here and requesting title for those properties, you shouldn't be rude to us. In fact count your Blessings you have a job. Hanging up on me was ignorant because on behalf of others you do this to who may not have strength to call back and report you, I'll gladly do it. Enjoy your day and I hope this company retrains you because you shouldn't be working with People who are mourning, at all.</Review><user_id>100674127452293184702<//user_id>< username>

<text>Please Save yourself and family headaches and find another Mortuary. This is by far the most unorganized and inefficient cemetery I have ever had to deal with. Many of our family members are here but they still made my life hell and continue to drag out our grief with financial problems through their departments in charge of insurances and arrangements. They never answer the phone, they don’t follow through on their word, many of them have let us down in this process. If it were not for other loved ones already being buried here, I would have taken my mom elsewhere. Do not use Rose Hills if you have a choice.< /text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

Family Support Advisor, Cecelia Chan was a godsend for us.  She guided us when my mother passed away a couple of years ago and again recently when my father passed.  Cecelia provided our family much comfort by taking care of all of our needs in a sincere and compassionate manner on both occasions. She was always ready and eager to help us with every detail of our needs.  Thank you so much, Cecelia. You are a beautiful person and we appreciate you so much!< /review>

<rate>5<//rate><Text>I can’t get over what a great experience we had with Rose Hills.  What should’ve been a difficult, confusing time, was everything but with Carmen and the Rose Hills staff’s help. I truly felt like Carmen was helping plan her own loved one’s memorial services.  On top of that, given the COVID situation, we were still allowed to have 72 people in attendance—chairs were set up with social distancing in mind and policies were set in place to protect attendees.  The outdoor Memorial Patio tent location is STUNNING.  I would’ve chosen the outside over the inside chapel if given the option.  The view, the water feature....just perfect.  We were celebrating the life of my father, and he would’ve loved everything about it.

The guys who set my father’s casket into the ground was respectful and gentle, giving us a very pleasant burial experience. The property is expansive and very well-maintained.  Its location allows for not only great views but also a nice breeze.   Something I know will be nice when we visit dad in the future.

I can’t recommend Rose Hills enough.  Thank you, Carmen and team, for being a part of our family in this difficult time.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

Dear David Da Rosa,

The kindness and  compassion you showed us at a very sensitive time is much appreciated. You went out of your way taking us as guests into the beautiful park (Rose Hills) showing us all the available options. I know you put your whole self into making us feel comfortable. It is reassuring to know that those who work so hard achieve the recognition they deserve. We're very blessed to count you as a friend.  We will be highly recommending Rose Hills Services to our family and friends. Thank You again.</Review>

I would like to commend Ms. Kristy Tran.  Ms. Tran is a wonderful young lady.  She is a very respectful person.  Knowledgeable, caring and great personality.  I felt so relax, just like how it feels when you are with someone you know.  She helped my husband and I find the piece of land where we will rest in peace, according to our needs.  (I hope many, many years from now) .  She did not stop showing us different areas, until we found the one we liked the most.

Ms. Tran also helped me select my funeral services, I'm happy with the package we put together.  she tried her best to give us the best deal.

I'm very happy she was assigned to help us.  I know we can count on her for anything we need.

Thank you.

Thank you.<//Review>

The initial customer service ,  up to the memorial service/burial was excellent.  that was back in mid january.  after everything was paid for, we were still in contact with our rose hill representative brian in finalizing the headstone design and wording.  for reasons unknown to us, all communication/contact ceased.  after numerous attempts to contact brian, without any return calls, we attempted to contact rose hill customer service.  that was over a month ago and we are now in mid april and still without any response from rose hills.  feeling frosted and frustrated, my sister dropped off a physical copy of the headstone design at rose hills this week after not receiving any response over the phone other than "we will get back to you" and "we have been busy".  we were informed by the front desk it will take another 10-15 days for a response.  we understand there is a pandemic  and there have been many deaths for rose hills to handle.  but the lack of response or any communications from the rose hill representative and customer service on our last leg of completing our mother's funeral arrangement is inexcusable.  what a way to run a business during one family's period of sadness   we would've easily rated rose hills a five star.  because of their bungling of the last leg of our mother's journey, they deserve no more than a one star.< /review>

I would give Rose Hills 6 stars if I could.  This is the most beautiful cemetery in the world with magnificent views.  We especially enjoyed the tour of the old Mausoleum where a scene from Terminator 2 was filmed.  The old mausoleum is an absolute gem!  Our experience with Rose Hills has been positive.  Hing Hong assisted my family with our purchases and we now consider each other friends.  He is someone we trust and would send him referrals.  He is knowledgeable and compassionate.  He has so much energy it's contagious.  God bless Hing and his family.  He is our angel and has done so much for our family.  People don't normally think about buying plots or services, but if you are thinking about this, make sure you ask for Mr. Hong.< /Review>

For the last 40+ years, we've had memorial services held here, starting with my grandfather in 1976, and they never disappoint. Our most recent service was for my dad, Kenneth Lee Jacoby, who passed on Thanksgiving (11/26/20) and from the initial phone call to arrangements to burial, the professional courtesy and heart-felt condolences and sensitivity to the family are unmatched. In a world where cash seems to be king for most, Rose Hills went above and beyond in caring for the needs and wishes of my family. Communication was clear and present every step of the way and it is so appreciated beyond words, that I find rest in knowing we've entrusted our last wishes to Rose Hills. They truly have their act together! Thank you, Thank You, THANK YOU!<//review><time>1609444908126< /time>< Gmap_id>

<Review>My dad suddenly passed away from an unexpected illness. He thankfully made arrangements years in advance at Rose Hills Memorial Park.  From the moment we called them to request a pick up at the hospital to the final vase that was placed in the ground at the end of the service, everyone that was involved in laying him to rest was exceptional.  The mortuary office specialists,  arrangements counselor, funeral director, and even the grounds specialists who kindly offered to place remaining funeral flowers in the vase and watered the grass (for priority closing), everyone was professional, compassionate, and gracious.  Many thanks to Elizabeth, Garrett, Janine, Anthony and Mario.  I may have left out a few others who attended to us, but we appreciate your work more than words can express.</Review><rate>5<//rate><Pics>None<//Pics><time>1603856540160<//time></record></dataset><record>
<Rating>5<//Rating><Text>When my grandmother passed away, our family didn’t know what to do.  My best friend referred me to Cecilia Chan who is a Family Support Advisor at Rose Hills. She was also helping my best friend for her father’s funeral.  Cecilia is very detail-oriented, professional and compassionate.  She provided us with all the details and guided us through the whole process during our difficult time.  After my grandmother funeral, we understand how important it is to have pre-planning.  Cecilia helped us for our family pre-planning and we know that she will take care us the same way she took care my grandmother.  We are happy we found Cecilia and highly recommend her professional service.< /Text>< pictures>

The cemetery itself is beautiful but I'm not happy with what happened and how the situation was handled. my father was left at the hospital for 6 days after he passed, They can't answer as into why, they blame the hospital, I was on hold over 5 hours trying to reach someone to find out why my dad was not picked up. I had supervisor's from hospital call me and asked me why my father was not picked up,  I filled out a claim for someone to call me back because I was very concerned , I literally got a phone call like 1 week later. they still charge me transportation fees. I understand their is a pandemic, but instead of getting automated text asking me if I wanted to embalmed my father when he was not even there they should make it personal and make a phone call. not a text.  They have a lot of money with all that they charge they should hire more people. I have more to say but one review and the more I say wont change anything. just venting on how I feel about Rose Hills customer service< /Review>

My mother and I had to purchase a plot recently for my fathers unfortunate passing. We had a wonderful sales agent, Dianne Brooks who took really good care of us. She showed us around patiently to help us see which location within the cemetery we wanted him buried. She then, stayed in the location well after closing time to make sure that the purchase was finalized. She then would take time out of her day off to call my mother and see how she was doing emotionally, even after the process was finished. She made sure we had all of our questions answered. She was a complete Angel with the whole hassle of burying my father, and surely made things so much easier for us in our moment of despair.  She also helped us get the soonest possible date for the burial and services. if she wouldn't of had been there for us, we would have had to wait a whole month after my father's demise, to bury him and hold the services, and we really did not want that.
Rose Hills Mortuary is also a beautiful cemetery. very peaceful, enormous, and very clean. They are also doing their best at keeping distance and cleaning midst this coronavirus going on. the chapels are all very beautiful, and the service we had a was beautiful.</Text>

<text>I’ve always had the best experience with Rose Hills. Especially with their staff member, Amy Tsai. She is smart and extremely resourceful, accommodating, respectful and anticipates all of my needs. She’s helped me with funeral planning for my grandma and even was there the day of the funeral to ensure the day was easy and as it could be. Amy shares knowledge related to cultural needs, traditions, ethnic background customs, religion, and age practices. I was able to qualify for financing to afford the costs too, ask about these programs. Amy even helped coordinate with all the other Rose Hills staff members for me, for a personalized experience. I’ve recommended her services to all my family and friends. She will exceed your expectations. Most importantly, she is personable while respectful and actually listens to what our needs are, budgets and family wishes and will always get you the best deal.

My father was the first member of the family to pass away.  Without any prior experience, I did not know what to do at that time.
Luckily, I met the sales consultant Miss Cecilia Chan in the City of Industry office.  Miss Chan was very kind and attentive.  She helped us select a plot and arranged the service.
Throughout the process, she was there for everything.  She always responded when I called. On the day of the burial, she even came to the service to help.
Later she also helped me select a plot for my own preplanning.  When I told her about my autopayment issue, she even coordinated with the accounting dept to solve all my problems.  I am very happy with the service that Rose Hills and Miss Cecilia Chan provided.</Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMCIPTmrYOHxNMA9YMNcRPmHsn5kVbEHOJQwoyr=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< Resp>

Began calling on 2/19 speaking with staff about arranging burial.  On 2/27 was given a date for 3/15 and time for services and they said someone would contact us for payment and signing papers. We live in another state making these arrangements it has been a horrible experience we keep calling back and they keep saying they will contact us. We are coming from out of state have are time off of work scheduled and have payed hotels so when we arrive. Funeral is Monday the 15th today is the 12th and nobody had contacted us.This is horrible  at a time like this.we understand  a pandemic is going on but customer service is really bad especially having to do all arrangements from another state. Called this morning  right when it opened someone again said they would  call shortly and nothing yet.<//Text>

<text>Excellent service.  David da Rosa at Rose Hills was great to talk to, he worked with my busy schedule and he took his time in answering all my questions with the utmost respect and patience.  And I had A LOT of questions.  David gave me details that I had not thought of myself and made sure I had all the information I needed.  I highly recommend Rose Hills and if you can speak to David da Rosa for a loved ones final arrangements, you will be very impressed.  Needless to say, I felt so comfortable and at peace with my decision for our family plot that did complete the purchase the same day with Rose Hills.</text><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

<Review>We visited Rose Hills for the first time in June because my grandfather was ill.  It was extremely difficult for us to arrange this during such emotional times.  Picking a spot for my grandfather was heart wrenching, not to mention we have not gone out to shop for anything since March.

Rose Hills employees made us feel safe, our purchase was done online.  Hing Hong gave us many choices without any pressure.

My grandfather passed away in August.  In regards to the services, they have multiple white tents.  Reminded me of outdoor weddings in Asia.  It was breezy and my grandfather's funeral was filled with heart warming speeches. We were heartbroken but we got closure that day.

I was impressed to witness Rose Hills implementing social distance and safety guidelines.  My family felt safe.  On the day of the burial, the dirt was already dug up and the process was quick, I still find it hard to believe that my grandfather is no longer here.

I feel like Rose Hills go above and beyond their services and definitely exceeded my expectations. I would think there are many heroes here that go unrecognized, Hing Hong and his team would be heroes in our hearts.< /Review>< pictures>

<rate>1< /rate><Text>I was highly disappointed with the service and concern that I received during this most difficult time. No sympathy, no compassion.  Rose Hills has definitely lowered their standards especially in the employees. I dealt with them 6 years ago when my daughter passed and now recently when my husband passed. Definitely not the same service. The employees were not helpful, didn’t return calls or emails, only when it came to them getting their money. Employee who showed us the property location looked like he dug the grave himself. His black suit was so dirty it was brown and faded. He rushed the whole appointment even after we asked him to relax several times. When it came to dropping off my husband’s clothes the representative who took it was so rude almost as if I was disturbing her. This whole experience has really scared me. Definitely would not recommend them.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

Nice mortuary.   Nice, clean and cheaper than the others.  Kristy Tran help us to get the lots.    She is very patience and  accommodating, we came for one lot and ends up buying three lots because of her help and patience.  I will recommend this mortuary and Kristy for her awesome customer service.  - LUCIA M.</Review>

Want to give kudos to Cecilia Chan, Family Support Advisor. She is a wonderful person with great personality. She explained in detail regarding the pre-planning, grave site purchase, and funeral service for my family. She never hesitated to answer any questions and was very patient. She even helped out at my dad’s funeral. Also want to thank the funeral service team for their assistance and advise. I highly recommend Cecilia and her team.</Text>

I was looking for a place for my father who passed away. Kristy Tran in Family Service was very helpful. She gave me all the details on pricing for my father. The most important thing was I never felt rushed by Kristy. She is very caring and she made me feel better. Most people just want to close the deal and Kristy is not like that.</Text>

Where else can you go for unobstructed Los Angeles view while remembering your family members. My dad's friend Hing Hong helped us with our purchases.  We came during May when LA was just starting to re-open.  We met with Mr. Hong and his supervisor Lin under a red canopy tent.  My family had many complicated questions and Mr. Hong answered them all with professionalism and patience.

Mr. Hong presented my family with many selections first using a laptop, that came along with prices. We were able to  view a variety of plots before we came to our decision on which ones to visit in person.  There was no sense of trickery or guilt trip during this process.

I wanted to say thank you to Mr. Hong for keeping social distance during our visit, he guided us to sit under a canopy, and we felt safe.  We were comfortable dealing with him.  Our family appreciates you all.  Rose Hills is beautiful and to our surprise, our plot was affordable, we did not realize we can make monthly contributions, what a pleasant surprise.  Thank you Mr. Hong!<//Review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

I greatly appreciate that I was able to temporarily entomb my father during the pandemic.  I don't know of any other mortuary that offered this option.  If you are asking me to rate the service at Rose Hills before my father's funeral I'd say a 1 star, but if you are asking me to rate the service the day of the funeral I would say 5 stars.  My father died in April, but was not buried (by choice) in November.  I spoke to at least 3 people the week after he died and they all had something different to say.  The right hand wasn't talking to the left hand.  There was so much confusion that I asked to speak with a supervisor.  When my coordinator called the following week I spent about 1.5hrs on the phone.  We went over all the details regarding my father's service and the options I had due to the pandemic.  When I was ready to plan his funeral, it was impossible to make any plans.  I sent emails, left voicemails and it would take up to 4 days to get a response.  Even a week before the funeral I could not get an answer to my questions.  I spoke to her 3 times during the planning, but it was in between clients so our conversations were very brief.  I spoke to her 1 week before my father's funeral and never spoke to her again. Either she didn't know how to manager her time or Rose Hill's needs to hire more employees, but NO one should go through the stress that I went through to plan a funeral.  I felt as if I wasn't important since our plots had been paid for 20 years earlier.  The day of the funeral I had an exception funeral director.(Nicholas Ochoa)  Compassionate, informative and respectful.  We reviewed the funeral services 2 days before and I found out that there was additional services I was getting the day of the funeral that were never told about. He arrived early at the tent and stayed with me to the very end.  Your location is lovely, but you have terrible customer service. The wait times on the phone are too long and it's very difficult to get any help.< /text>

I want to thank Amy Tsai for the wonderful experience while at Rose Hills. She was incredibly understanding and patient as she was helping us find exactly what we were looking for. She spent hours showing us all the different locations at Rose Hills and spent a lot of her own time to thoroughly go through each location and gave us detailed information and gave lots great recommendations.

Having to contact a Cemetery for my father’s burial has been emotionally the hardest thing I’ve had to do in my life. I had to do all the arrangements all by my self since I’m an only child and I was clueless to what needed to be done or how things worked? My cousin recommended me to Mr. H. Hong family support advisor/cemetery sales representative. When I called him he immediately showed his respect and expressed his condolences. This meant a lot to me because it showed me he cared for how I was feeling. I had just lost my father to Covid and my biggest fear was to loose my mother who was also at the hospital fighting the virus. I was an emotional wreck, but Mr. Hong helped me through by making the experience less of a burden. He was very attentive to all my questions (I made many) and explaining everything clearly. Once we when to see the plots I was amazed at how beautiful Rose hills Cemetery is. It was breathtaking, clean and so peaceful that it calmed my feelings of distress and changed my whole outlook of what I was about to do, finding my father’s  resting place. After looking at a few places I found the perfect place. Mr. Hong mentioned a discount they were offering so I decided to get two more resting plots next to my father’s witch allows me to pay in monthly payments. I also want to mention Ms. J.Phoebe sales arrangement specialist  who was very kind and pleasant. At the moment of payment even after contacting my bank to give a heads up of a large payment transaction their was still an issue releasing the funds to Rose hills but Ms.Phoebe made the process less stressful and worked with me in making partial payments from different accounts until it was all taken cared of. To conclude, my fathers service was beautiful. I’m glad I chose Rose Hills memorial park and I’m happy to say my mother was released form the hospital and is recuperating well.</Review>

Although Rose Hills has always been a part of my life whenever a beloved passed away, I’ve always been very much involved in participating in the memorial services and never having the chance to meet  someone who works for the mortuary.  Until I came across my students’ parent, Ms. Yvonne Wang.  She took me by surprise when she casually hands me her business card and spoke to me very naturally about her line of work and immediately informed me about the special discounts available.  Ms. Wang definitely knew her trade well and conveyed the discounts and proceedings very clearly.  She has me start a conversation with my parents.  Her sales style is assertive yet comfortable.  I’ve enjoyed her presentations very much and I’ve also tried to connect her with my social circles.<//Review>

Recently, my family and I had to look into burial properties in preparation for my father’s passing. It was our first time making this type of purchase, so we had no idea what to consider or look for going in. Our agent Mr. Hing Hong patiently showed us around the cemetery with detailed explanations at each site and made sure he answered all our questions. He even went out of his way and met us at the hospital because we were unable to be at the Whittier Rose Hills office to finalize the contract. After the purchase was completed, he would check in with us on the funeral arrangements to make sure that we were offered services that would best fit our needs and got us the best price. He was very considerate of my family’s needs during this difficult time and that was a key reason why we felt so comfortable purchasing from Mr. Hong. If and when my friends need this service, I will definitely refer them to Mr. Hing Hong.< /text>

Grace Lo was terrific. She really took the time to explain the process and answer all of my questions thoroughly. I never felt rushed or pressured to make any decisions, Grace was very prompt in returning all of my calls. Her demeanor during the difficult time made the whole process much easier. I felt like Grace went above and beyond to help me out.< /review>

<text>My family’s and I had the worst experience with this cemetery. The people are insensitive and in our view unprofessional. I have had better experiences buying used cars then laying my family member to rest. I do not recommend this place and if I had the means to remove my family I would do it with in a blink of an eye.
The company name sounds nice but it is nothing more than a conveyor belt at a huge expensive cost. Go anywhere else.< /text></record>

<Text>Rose Hills is truly and certainly a place to remember especially when they hire competent people to represent the company and products. Our family isn’t new to Rose Hills a lot of my moms family members are interred there. Years ago my parents purchased their burial plots and the counselor we had was not knowledgeable of what she was selling. She told us the properties my parents were purchasing we were  going to have two interments in each space. Years later we found out that wasn’t true, she didn’t include the specific details on the contract. Fast forward to June 2019 our family had the pleasure of working along with someone new to us, our Service Counselor Ms. Kristy Tran. With the promotions the Memorial Park was having at the time my parents added a second interment to their burial properties, purchased their funeral packages. Kristy took her time with us, she didn’t rush us. Answered all of our questions, patiently went over every detail prior to signatures and method of payment. We’re truly blessed, fortunate to have been given a Counselor with knowledge, compassion. Thank you Rose Hills for having a great employee on staff.</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>{'time': 1599686656891, 'text': 'Emily, our team is passionate about offering the compassionate and helpful care that is absolutely essential throughout this process, and I appreciate you taking a moment to highlight this in such a thoughtful message.

Rose Hill is a very peaceful place and we decided to have our eternity home there with the help of agent Cecilia Chan. Cecilia shows us to different sections of the park.

The morning of her funeral we as a family were driving up to the main gates of Rose Hills..no one had spoken a word during the ride.. Then there, standing in the mist under a tree, was a whole family of deer to great us. My dad said, "I feel so much better now."

Our funeral director was prepared and was very patient with us .  We had a few questions and he was able to answer them on the spot and prepare the materials before guests arrived.  He even took the time to arrange the flowers in a vial to put into the ground (he waited with us for 2 hours while the casket was lowered into the ground as ours was a double-stack).</Text>

Thank you for your surburb professionism on my husband Ronald Mickens funeral.. From the beginning of this journey when my sister in law contacted Rose Hills Mortuary Mr. Lynn went beyond to assist me with every question and took the time out to help my family. Mrr. Lynn was surburb. Hey went beyond the call of duty. During the ceremony Mr. Nicholas and the other staff members were surburb. They were so sensitive to my needs and the whole entire family. My husbands body was extremely well put togeter. He looked so peachful and natural. My family was extremely pleased. Rose Hills Mortuary was dynatmite in making this event as peaceful and well put together. My husband had Doves at his ceremony and this man was extremely kind and loving. He took the time to explain the meaning of the Doves to my grandbaby girl. The entire ceremony was surburb and every employee involved made this sad occasion pleasant and peaceful. There aren't enough words to express how grateful my whole family was for this perfect ceremony, funeral. Thank you again for all the extra hard wodk put out their by ALL your employees involved. All your hard work has not been overlooked. Thank you again and again. God Bless</review>

My husband died about a year ago.  We had a small service and reception at Rose Hills.  From the point where they picked him up from the coroner to when we had the service, they were professional and supportive.  They made the process easy at a time when I needed as few complications as possible.  My father is also buried there.  They’ve kept his grave site and indeed the place beautiful.<//Text>

When my father passed away 30 years ago, she purchased an individual marker for herself.  When I went to make arrangements for my mother, they had no record of her purchase.  Fortunately, I found the receipt, along with a letter from Rose Hills stating that it was made and where it was stored; however, the ORIGINAL MARKER WAS LOST.  They said they would provide a new one.  Months later they installed a new marker, but it had an INCORRECT INSCRIPTION.  Months after this, I was told a correct one had been installed.  But again, another lie.  I went to visit and the incorrect marker was still there.  We couldn't have a burial or funeral for my mother, because of the pandemic, which is understandable, but 8 MONTHS LATER AND THIS IS STILL NOT RESOVED.  I ADVISE EVERYONE "DO NOT" PURCHASE ANYTHING IN ADVANCE.   Not only do I think it's unsympathetic and rude to ask grieving customers, while they are making arrangements for their loved ones, to plan their own demise, it's unwise.  Seems to be a ploy to get your money in advance knowing that the records might be lost and re-purchased unknowingly when the person actual dies.
Overall this has been a  stressful ordeal.  I CONTINUOSLY HAVE TO FOLLOW-UP.  There were also delays with the death certificates and miscommunication on other issues.   I wish our family plots were located at smaller local cemetery.  They seem to have more empathy and understanding towards the families needs. And they keep up the landscaping maintenance.  Whenever I visit, I need to have clippers and tools with me.  Also, I need to remember the flower removal day because they will throw out brand new flowers...doesn't matter if it's their birthday, etc.
I also know others who have and still are experiencing negative ordeals with Rose Hills.  I truly believe Rose Hills is more focused on financial gain then focus on the concerns of their clients!< /review><user_name>Cheri Kimi</user_name><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

<Name>Didi Zaky</Name><Text>As a prearranged customer of Rosehills, with prior great service received, it is very unfortunate to leave 3 stars as a review, especially during this pandemic and the challenges we all face. However, the need to let people know first hand, our recent experience, is the right thing to do. We do understand a delay in laying our loved one to rest, especially during this globally impacted time. It took over three weeks to lay our mother to rest due to scheduling issues on Rosehills’ end. Meanwhile, other mortuaries and memorial parks were more efficient and timely in rendering their internment services.

Our prearranged services obviously had to be modified to comply with covid protocol. Yet, the encumbered fees were fully charged, without any refunds for services not utilized. On the day of the service all was going smoothly as we hoped, except for another oversight on the part of Rosehills. It is a small oversight, but lends to the lack of attention our family expected or received. The memorial cards we ordered were not given to us to distribute to our family and friends. When we brought this up with the representative, he told us we didn’t pay for any cards and proceeded to show us a printout of what was included. I kindly asked to have someone contact me as I didn’t want to draw any more attention than he’d already done.

After the burial, when most had already left, this gentleman realized his mistake, and told us the cards were still at his office. Thankfully, we received the cards, but the run of the mill treatment we received from the beginning of this experience, until the end, left more disheartened feelings. There was no guidance from any Rosehills staff members, including our long time sales representative. What we took away from this was much disappointment and a need to alert others. We plan to move the remaining prearranged services we have away from Rosehills along with the several other properties we own there.<//Text><Resp>{'time': 1610470691789, 'text': 'Didi, thank you for making us aware of your experience as we care deeply about ensuring your expectations are exceeded.

<gmap_id>0x80c2d14070d1b8fb:0x5416841843ccde6c<//gmap_id><text>It is painful to even give one STAR to Rose Hills Memorial Park.  My beloved mother recently passed away and because she care so much for us and did not want to burden us with the monument expense, she financed in advance since 2009 and paid in full.  She worked at a Dry Cleaner and made every single payment for the monument with an interest rate of 9.9% given by RH Cemetery Corp (I guess Rose Hills is in the Finance business as well).

Since the death of my mother, I have been trying to place the order for the Monument she paid with her hard earn money.  However, Rose Hills Interment Office Department for whatever reason does not want to place the order.  I have either spoken or directed to 4 different Associates (Austin, Michael, Lauren, can't remember the 4th person name) who promise me they will call me back to place the order, but never received one single call back from any of the Associates.  Therefore, I decided to speak with the Manager, Joshua Ramirez.  We had a conversation and once again, I was promised by Joshua that my mother's case will be a priority on his list and he will PERSONALLY look into it and CALL ME BACK within 24 hours with an update.  And guess what??!!!  He NEVER call me back either. I guess management at Rose Hills train the Associates to NEVER call back your customers.

So, I decided to speak with someone above Joshua Ramirez.  I was told that his name is Scott Mitchell.  I called Scott Mitchell extension, but of course no answers and no way to leave a voicemail. The phone keeps ringing, but no answer nor it is setup for voicemail, very convenient.  Basically, I am left with nobody to talk to.

Finally, I decided to cancel the contract and ask for a full refund so we can place the Monument with a different company.  So, I call back to the interment office and told them I want to cancel the contract and request for a full refund.  I spoke with Nichole who transfer me to Jessica in the Business Office who will be handling the refund.  And guess what, the Business Office told me that they could offer a partial refund because the contract was too OLD (Like we all can predict when we are going to die.  If this is the case, then they should not pre-sale funeral arrangements), and for the full refund I need to speak with the Interment Office.  Basically, I am being shuffle from one department to another until I get tired of the situation and finally give up or accept a partial refund.  This is the perfect SCAM not to deliver on the service already paid since 2009 or send you away with a fraction of the hard earn money my mother paid for. I can't believe that Rose Hills has the nerve to offer only partial refund when in fact, the $7500 my mother paid back in 2009, today, it will be worth much more.  Rose Hills was holding onto my mother's money earning interest and now, they only want to give a portion of that money.  Please tell me that this isn't right.

I am going to fight this until the end of it for my mother's hard earned cash.  Rose Hills is taking advantage of my poor mother in her grave and it is not fair.  Rose Hills should be ashamed of their business practices of pre-selling funeral arrangements and not delivering on their promises or telling you that you will only get partial refund because the contract is too OLD.  Please, do not pre-purchase anything from Rose Hills.  Otherwise, you will suffer the same pain I am going thru right now.  I hope my long review will prevent many of you out there making funeral arrangements for your love ones at Rose Hills.

During this very difficult time, Rose Hills consults failed to follow through from start to finish. There was an email sent after midnight on the day my mother passed away that required a timely response; 24 hours. It was the permission to embalm and information needed for the death certificate. Who’s checking personal emails for important information such as this during this difficult time? No one said to look for this information at a certain time nor did anyone follow up with a phone call to inquire about the missing and important item after this 24 hour deadline.
The counselor I was assigned was no help at all. She lack the ability to walk me through the thorough steps in my mother’s pre planned and paid in full contract. I had to ask questions of her. She had 10% of the answers. Very poor customer service.
Their staff referred to my mother as “he or your father”. This was troublesome, because the counselor failed to identify my mother’s gender in any and all paperwork. If that box wasn’t checked, they should be taught to say, “loved one”, instead of trying to guess if the decease’s is female with a gender neutral name!
This upset me to no end that exactly 9 reps referred to my mother as “he”. The only person that got it right was a funeral director by the name of Ty (Tyron). Of the 9, only 2 were supervisors who still failed to return my calls or confirm my questions. Just not a good experience at all. Ty was the epitome of an A-1 class service professional. He was caring, responsive, attentive to our ever need.
Overall I would say Rose Hills should have better training for their counselors before they are assigned to clients.<//text>

Making funeral arrangements are difficult, for a loved one or for oneself. So it makes sense to pre-plan the arrangement when decisions can be made under calm and unpressured conditions, not clouded by emotions. Sophie was helpful, knowledgeable and sensible, giving way to a smooth process. Thank you.</Text>

This is like my 2nd home since my mommy passed away. She passed on Thanksgiving Day of 2017. I watch the Sunset, it's very calm ,quiet. I like going not only to visit mom also you're there reminiscing on so much memories your loved one left you with.<//Text>

<Text>Rose Hills is a beautiful place and their service has been wonderful. During the stressful time of a loved one's passing, the staff was helpful and understanding, and guided us all the way through in planning for the funeral service. They answered every questions we have and went beyond our expectations, especially during this time of the covid-19 pandemic. I have been impressed and in fact, I am doing my pre-planning with them.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

If I could give NEGATIVE STARS I WOULD!!! I always liked Rose Hills up until Thursday 8/27/2020! It was my Dear Aunts Funeral at first everything seemed okay but then it started feeling REALLY RUSHED and I thought to myself wow this isn’t okay what’s going on?! In a few minutes I realized that right next to us there was another service starting, I couldn’t believe it. As we start to lower my aunts body the man had to stop so he wouldn’t make any noise with the tractor because of the other service starting.So now we are left waiting in the sun for a long time for the other service to finish so we can finish burying my aunt, THIS IS NOT OKAY!!!! Why couldn’t they wait for us to finish with our aunts service since we started first!!! It was the WORST EXPERIENCE EVER to be there in the moment honoring my Aunt and for it to but cut like that is so cruel and insensitive to our feelings, mind you this is a very touchy moment for a family and I thought your personnel would be professional enough to understand that but I guess not your personnel lacks professionalism and ability to schedule correctly!! NO FAMILY SHOULD EVER HAVE TO GO THROUGH THIS EXPERIENCE EVER!!!! Not only that but you would think that because of the pandemic and social distancing that you wouldn’t have a two services right next to each other, the other family had to walk through us to get to their site.. If you’re reading this please reconsider, Rose Hills doesn’t care, the reason I wrote this post it to save other Family’s from the heartache....it’s too late for our family :(</Text>

<text>When my father passed away, we were not prepared and did not know what to do.  Rose Hills and their excellent staff helped us lessen the burden and guided us to go through the difficult time without any problems.  From the selection of the burial sites to the final lowering and backfill of my father's grave, they took care of everything and more.  We were very satisfied with their services, especially with Mr. James Kim, who helped us from the beginning to the end of the funeral service.  Thank you very much.  Without the sincere and comforing support from Rose Hills, it could have been more difficult to overcome the loss of our father.  Even with the COVID-19 pandemic precautions, we were able to say goodbye to our father and have a meaningful funeral service for our family.  They have arranged everything so we can be comfortable while sending our father away.  So, my family and I thank them for everything they did for us.

To Whom it May concern,

We only have the best of words to express how fortunate and grateful we are; to have Rosehill’s whole team helping us while my mom pasted away on July of this year.

John Wong, who helped my mom’s funeral arrangement, he is very detailly, patience, efficiency, kind and knowledge.

Allen Chen and Stanley, both did a wonderful job to organized my mom’s funeral services with our Chinese Custom on July at Sky Rolls Hill Chapel,  Our family were very impressive the services and their effort. They made our family comfort and please.

Amy Lai and Betty Tze, are our family favorize, we bought a funeral arrangement from them a few months ago, glad we did. They answered any questions anytime we have, they always smile, kind, great attitude and provide an excellent services. I strong believer that Amy and Betty deserves a recognition.  Because of their outstanding services, my husband and I bought a lawn and Pre-arrangement from them,  I also referred one of my sister bought a lawn from them.

I will continue to refer people to Amy and Betty.

I am very proud of your Rose Hill Team. They are the Best!

Thanks!

There should be negative stars for placrs luke this. Had our 1 year old sons celebtration of life here at the chapel ontop and they didnt have projector working and we paid an extra 1000 for them to hold his urn with his ashes over night and take to our church the next day and when they deliveres it to church his urn had a chip on it and they said it must have happen when they transported it down the hill last night at Rose Hills. So they said oh well give you back the 1000 for leaving the urn overnight and then wantes us to go buy another urn and they would pay us for it, so we told them no you will go buy the exact one and drop it off at our house. Would never go there again!</Text>

<Review>This experience pales in comparison with the ones in the past. After,my initial phone  appointment I couldn't reach my funeral  arranger to correct errors and  omissions on my docusign. It took 9 days with the help of a supervisor. The site I chose had a water leak and the viewing site was changed to a lovely chapel to bad the funeral wasn't able to be hekd there. As soon as the funeral arranger contacted me to correct her errors she sent a bill without explaining any payment options. This should have been done at the initial  funeral arrangement . I have my parents,
grandparents, and siblings buried and setvices held at Rose Hills and never experienced anything like this. There us no excuse for an arranger with a direct line, a business line, and email not getting back to grieving  family. If I had to do it all over I would only do the burial because I purchased plots many years prior.</Review><pics>None<//pics><Resp>{'time': 1600975118383, 'text': 'Lawrence, thank you for making us aware of your experience, as we care deeply about ensuring your expectations are exceeded.

<Review>My family has dealt with rose hills for 15 Years I’ve always loved it until this last service for our most recent loved one, first phone call Gabriella and Victoria they were great the attention to detail was nice, Chris the sales rep. Great guy.
Until we got to our arranger Derek started off good but after that He was too busy with his personal issues and does not return emails or call back request.
Our loved ones service was in the wrong tent from where he originally told us, all siblings signed in person and in DocuSign for paperwork process needed Twice Because Esther told us they couldn’t find the first copies (btw Esther lied to us as to when she sent the emails and after Asking 3 times and me staying on the phone with her until we recv. them for the second time) on the day of the service they had to sign again for the third time because Derek seems to be clueless as to what is going and now caused the cremation to be delayed and still have not heard back from anyone.  Now we need to cross our fingers and hope the certificates were handled properly as requested from day one. Icing on the cake yesterday we recv. A email survey for feedback so here you go.

The assistance at the service really was helpful and organized along with the flowers delivered.  The cosmetic team did a great job and made her look beautiful as she deserved.  It is unfortunate that I have to write this review and over shadow everyone’s else’s work due to others .
Please do not respond to this review asking for my phone number and best time to reach out to our family as you have all of our information just ask Derek and Esther!  We are not looking for excuses as we recv. Lots of those already.< /Review>< pics>

Always have respected Rose Hills and up until today, would always give 5 stars.  Today, a day before Mother's Day, the website shows they opened at 8am.  I bought flowers and drove there only to see a banner that they open at 430pm to dusk.  Very disappointing.   Instead of spreading out visitors throughout the day, they will now have everyone there during a few hours trying to practice social distancing.<//Text>

During such a hard time Veronica F. Made my experience so much easier. She’s very friendly and helpful! She took me step by step and made sure I understood everything as it should be. Veronica F. Helped me find my baby the perfect spot to lay and I couldn’t thank her enough for it!!</Review>

<text>Losing a loved one is the hardest experience.  We have had the greatest help from Cecilia Chan at the hardest times we've experience.  No matter what our question was, Cecilia responded promptly, even on her days off.  She has been there to guide us through the planning process, during the services and any time after.  Cecilia Chan is truly Rose Hills greatest asset.

Thank you Mary Li and Rose Hills for helping my parents and I prepare for the future. Mary talked to us about all our options and services so that we can feel secure.
She showed us around the entire complex to find the right place for us to be together. She was so kind and caring, answering our late night questions. Area is well maintained and well kept.</text>

I am so thankful for the help from Grace Lo.  She is not only professional, kind and supportive, she just like the best friend for the family, when you need the help the most, she is there!

When my father was in critical condition, I found Grace, she helped me understand the process, options, found the best location, and had everything prepared in just few days.  After my father passed away, she helped me to go through the process step by step, guided me, helped me contact the different teams, having the process went smoothly.   I contacted her on the evening, over the weekend; she was always there, answered my questions, helped me, supported me.  She is very patient, understanding the sorrow heart; no push, no complaint, just there to help!    You can feel Grace’s sincere and kind heart!

She is also helping a lot on purchasing our place and services.  She provided very details on different plans, discussed with us about our needs, gave the best deals.  She cares about her customers, works with customers.  Even now, we continue receiving greetings and updates on services from Grace.

Thank you so much, Grace, I feel so thankful and secure working with Grace Lo.  I highly recommend Grace Lo and Rose Hills.</Review>

When my mother passed away recently, I felt lost and helpless. I didn’t know what to do, who to call to start the process. Patricia Mendoza was heaven sent. After talking to her on the phone, she connected me with the right person who was in charge of scheduling her body for pick up from the hospital. She stood on the phone with me and guided me every step of the way. She made sure we were connected to the right people, reminded me of my Appt for burial services, met us there to make sure we were comfortable, took us on the tour of the cemetery to where my mothers plot was, kept reassuring us that my mother was in good hands....🙏🏽❤️ And she was.... Rose Hills is such an amazing place. Patricia’s customer service skills were very appreciated by not only myself, but family and friends. She is very empathetic towards the loss of a loved one. She has unique and positive customer focused skills that set her apart from others and it is appreciated by all who have been blessed to have received her positive customer service. Thank You Rose Hills for allowing us to have such a great person, Patricia Mendoza, guide us through our mothers services! 🌹</Review>

A death is an event that you need to have compassionate people take you by the hand and patiently and compassionately guide you through the process.  The two lovely ladies that helped me were Nina Camacho and Wonder Luem.   Nina helped me make all of the decisions and offered recommendations when I asked her.  I was able to have my mother’s photo from when she was young and her own words beneath it, and as she said, she was going home to be with Jesus, where there is no sorrow.  The day of our graveside service was made perfect by the pastor from her church and we had help from the gentleman in charge there.  Changes I would have liked were:  the lady who sang my mother’s hymns needed actual music (sound).  I would have liked more chairs and maybe a larger tent, plus a stand for her photograph.  The all white flowers on her casket were more beautiful than any I’ve ever seen at a wedding.  We took them to her home for the reception and I later made arrangements for my two daughters and myself; they lasted a week.  Lastly, God sent Wonder to our home this week and she went through the next step, along with a planning guide.  She was so much more than an employee of Rose Hills - a former pastor and a lady who guided me through the next steps, along with important steps in life.  Thank you all, the family of Ruby and her daughter, Cynthia.</Text>

During the time of family loss, we had received full support from Rose Hill service providers. Although it was a difficult time for us, agent Grace Lo had helped to make it easier for our family.
She was compassionate. She was proactive in leading the entire process. Even few months after the funeral, she made a follow up call just to make sure our re-visitation experience was smooth.
Grace will be very successful in any service oriented industry. Don’t loose her!</Text>

Cecilia went above and beyond to provide us the best customer service and all the help we needed to ensure that the service went timely and smoothly.

We always knew planning ahead was the right thing to do for my family. Our family is multi ethnic and it was not easy to initiate this discussion. We looked at a few options for cemetery plots: Cypress, Glendale and Rose Hills. The gentleman name Hing Hong and his manager Julie Lin gave us a tour of the park. we were surprised at how big it was. It was beautiful, not what I expected of a cemetery at all. We ended up at a lawn where we can see the Buddhist temple. The price was surprisingly lower than my husband’s  expectations. We ended to getting an extra space for another family member. Great job Hing for being thorough in your approach and showing us all options.<//Review>

Rose Hills is the most beautiful mortuary i've ever seen. It looks more like a gigantic well maintained park overlooking the city. My Wife and I are so thankful to Mary Li who helped us every step of the way. Talking with her over the phone and showing us all the different plot locations. We were so well taken care of, we felt secure in getting our plot. Our children will be at ease knowing that we've taken care of this ahead of time. If you have any questions or concerns, ask for Mary Li! I would highly recommend doing this sooner than later.</Review>

This place is huge. Most visitors probably either never get to interact with their employees or experience only one of their many facilities. What I have experienced had been good. My mom and dad are buried here.  Other than being 45 mins. Drive for me to visit I like the place.</Text>

Mary Li was such a great help for my mother. She brought her around to see all the different location and options, and educated us on all the pre-arrangement services.
We eventually settled on getting a nook. The Rose Hills facility is beautiful and enormous, and the staff are so welcoming. Thank you so much for alleviating the stress from my family and helping us prepare for the future.<//review>

Drove 3,000 miles to visit my grandfather's grave for the first time. Was met with insensitive security guards blocking the access road to the grounds due to COVID-19. And they couldn't care less about my long journey.

Since it wasn't safe for me to visit the living, I chose to go visit my ancestors and family members who had passed away with the ultimate goal of seeing my paternal grandfather's grave for the first time. He died when I was too little to know him.

Every other graveyard in the nation that I passed through had closed their offices and buildings for obvious reasons (to protect their workers) and in compliance with local ordinances. But none of them closed their grounds out of respect for those who wanted to visit the testing places of their family members. This put NO ONE at risk, and gave me NO REASON to think or suspect that rose hills would turn me away since I didn't encounter any other cemeteries that were closed.

And yet Rose Hills chose to post security guards at their access roads. Closing the GROUNDS is despicable. You cannot keep people from visiting their FAMILY members resting in a place the FAMILY paid for. Your governor's order only required that you close your buildings, not the entire property.

We can not infect the dead with COVID. The only thing putting those security officers at risk was the fact that they were posted there. This was an INSENSITIVE AND UNCALLED FOR move by the cemetery owners. It's one thing to close your gift shop and offices to protect workers but to close the grounds was a slap in the face to me after I finally had the time/opportunity to visit my grandfather's grave. I'm still in disbelief that I was turned away and that an exception was not made given how long I traveled and how many days I slept in my car to keep myself and others safe in order to get there. Disgusting.<//review>

My wife and I and three couples (our close friends) bought plots at the same time through Grace Lo, she’s great, very personable, very knowledgeable and got us group discounts.  Grace Lo is a real professional, I would highly recommend her if you are looking for a plot.  We all had a very positive experience with Grace Lo and very impressed with Rose Hills.!< /Review>

< Review>
The Park is the best in Southern California in all aspects. I am pleased to own seven lots for my family and so are my wife and her sisters who have six lots. Last year both of our families buried our loved ones (father and mother in law) In Rose Hills with the assistance of the Park’s representative Flora Wang. In the time of our sorrow and depression Flora warmly and carefully arranged every things for us from the beginning to the end, relieving us from the burden of having to take care the funerals and burial services. She is patient, kind, diligent, and careful. After that kind of excellent services we decided to pre-purchase the funeral and burial packages for each of us who are living so that all will be ready and prepared when the time comes for each of us.< /Review>

Jimmy Hope as an experienced Family Support Counselor at Rose Hill Memorial Park, is definitely the right person, who we can trust. We met Jimmy when we walked in to their office on a Sunday Afternoon. He has presented us a detailed questionnaire in order to identify what kind of funeral service would be most economic and suitable based on our demands. I reckon that a professional who is able to listen to his client and dedicate his time to listen to his client, would be absolutely right person for you to trust.</text>

<Text>This was written on behalf of my mother and our family.   This was our first time planning a memorial service and it was the worst experience.  The initial pick up was very respective, the 2 gentlemen that came to the house to pick up my father's body was very nice, compassionate and gentle.  The 2nd meeting was with Jenny Munoz, arrangement counselor.  She was very professional and went over the package my parents had previously paid for, but honestly, I wish she would have told us one hour is not enough, and having one hour in between services is a horrible idea.  We did not have any more communications with Rose Hills until the day of the service.  We were told to come 30 minutes prior to the service, and that was not enough time.   Our flowers were delivered but not in the chapel, to later find out all 3 arrangements were sitting in some other holding area, so thankfully they were found and delivered to the chapel in time for the service.   The family should have met with the funeral director and technology person prior to the service for the order and especially if it's done in a different language, as the musician did not understand when to play what song.   Then when an unexpected guest went up to speak for an additional 10 minutes, it threw our time line and as the last speaker of the service, I found it VERY disrespectful that your staff were already taking things down in the reception area making all sorts of loud noise.  Our family and guests were rushed out of the chapel so you can prepare for the next service, and as we were half way out of the chapel, I turned around and the next person's coffin was already on the stage.   This was extremely unprofessional and I would NEVER recommend your company to anyone!<//Text><Time>1569795059817< /Time></record></dataset><record>

<text>My father passed away on 8/7/19 and still no marker. Have been dealing with Lupe Garcia and it hasn't been a good experience.  First they tried to tell us that the marker wasn't paid for it and that we have to paid for it.  When I actually went personally with my parents when they purchased it. After they double check they said that it was paid. ( So most likely if I wasn't present at the time of purchase probably they would charge us again). Today we found out that the marker was never ordered. Lupe said that we never called her back to make some changes on the marker, but the changes were sent to her email as she requested. She never bother to do a follow up call. Every time we used to ask the front desk for the marker they used to tell us that it takes about 8 weeks but they never bother to check in the system to see if it was already ordered. It hasn't been a good experience. And by the way if you guys need to talk to me Lupe has my information.<//text>< Pics>

Recently I spoke with Veronica Fierro to start planning for funeral arrangements and I was surprised at how above and beyond she went out the way just to make sure all my questions were answered. I definitely highly recommend her to anyone that needs to make any arrangements she’s just the best she will make sure no questions are left unanswered she took her time to go through it all with me. If you should find yourself in the need of any services contact Veronica Fierro you won’t regret it she’s very dedicated but most importantly caring and compassionate.< /Text>

She put together a package for my mom 9 years ago and during the unfortunate passing of my mom recently, I was in awe at how every detail came together for me. Being an only child I had no one to lean on, but I had Mary, my sister and friend. FOREVER grateful.</text>

<text>I had never had to arrange for a grave site for a family member, as our family had always scattered ashes at sea.  Veronica was very helpful.  She found a grave site in the same area as other family members for a reasonable price.  We walked out to the area and looked at our family members grave, and I knew this was just what my ex-husband would want (sadly he now has dementia so it was up to me to decide on funeral arrangements.)  I had heard that funeral homes put pressure on family members to spend a lot of money, but Veronica was very sensitive and caring.<//text><user_name>Barbara Jewel<//user_name></record>

My grandparents are buried here and we come a few times a year to visit them. It's a huge memorial park with tons of graves. There's always a service or memorial going on, and while it's very sad, it's also a reminder of how we're all in this same cycle of life together.

I love the different areas and how each has a very distinct feel and theme. My grandparents are in the grass right when you enter. It's a beautiful, sunny plot with some big trees nearby. My uncle is cremated and in an urn in the Buddhist​ temple area on top of the hill. Going up there, you'd forget where you are. It's almost like being in Asia. There's also a children's area, which is the saddest area to go through (for me). All the staff I've encountered here have been respectful, sensitive​, and helpful. I know they helped my family out when we were dealing with the loss of my grandparents.

They keep the grounds relatively well, for how big it is. You might have to cut away overgrowth over the tombstone you're visiting, but generally the grass is all trimmed and kept short enough.<//text>

<review>I would like to report a fraud Rose hill sales person.

June Park Lic# FD970, Rose hill Korean sales person was dishonest to her customers.

our family was one of victim.

What I paid and signed the contract over $9000 was for double bed grave option. that was 2 years ago. that option is first casket down and then 2nd on top of it.

my father passed away and we did funeral for him on a week of 4th of July 2019. While I watched bury for his casket, I saw and found that what I purchased was one casket and one cremation.

now I knew that my aunts family worked with her before and June did the same to aunt. they are 2nd victims.

I had two deep feelings that struggled now. one is sad because I lost my father, one is anger because June Park deceived me and my family.

This is 100% true story. I read whole contract paper term and conditions and Rose hill is a private property and they protected well all legal matters for themselves. in other words, once you signed the contract even sales person deceives you, there is nothing you can do get pay back or partial pay.

Please, please beware before sign, specially June Park.

She is definitely fraud one. she was lying.

if you see my post picture, casket surrounded by natural soil. that should be by concrete all around in order to be lay double bed grave down.< /review><GmapID>0x80c2d14070d1b8fb:0x5416841843ccde6c</GmapID>< Pics>

Not at the top of the list for Rose Hills is customer service, they are terrible.  They don't answer the phone and if you finally get through, they don't call back as promised.  I would not use but my mother already paid, but even that changes.<//text>

<Review>.. Bought cremation service from Joshua Liu at Rose Hills City of industry office. Him and his manager Julie Lin  both so helpful and profession, they don’t push sale which I like the most , they listen what I would need giving suggestions providing outstanding service and  walk me through every single detail.
I strongly recommend both of them.

The professionalism of all your staff was above and beyond.  Everyone was courteous,
Thoughtful and very respectful.  They took there time with us and explained everything
In detail.  I was skeptical  at first and a bit frustrated because of the delay in getting an
Appointment with your advisors, but when they took the time and explained all that needed
To be considered I understood.  It would have been easier for my family to have had the
Service just one day earlier, but in a way it worked out just as my Aunt really wanted it.<//review>

Unfortunately, our family has had a terrible experience here. We paid for the entire funeral and service 2 years ahead of our family members passing and you’d think we’d get tip top service. But it was the complete opposite. To begin, we didn’t get an appointment until about 4 days and got the bottom of the barrel in dates and times for the service. So if your planning on burying a loved one here don’t do it in advance!

Secondly, our arrangement counselor Juan Cuevas was all over the place in our first meeting. He was talking to us as if we’ve been there before and buried many loved ones. We had a pointless 3 hour meeting and at the end told us he wasn’t sure if it could happen because proper paperwork isn’t in place(which ideally he should’ve started with).  We had a million questions towards the end because he didn’t explain anything.

On top of that, we sent all 50 pictures on time to get printed in the memory book. The night before we receive and email confirming they only received 2 pictures. We immediately call and no answer. We respond to email and once again no answer.

No food or outside drink was allowed for guests during memorial services.

Hired an organist (through rose hills) to play during the service and he called me asking if I had a playlist so he can play (on the speaker through a phone) during the service. I told him we hired him to play (on the piano) music for the service, and he agreed.

Overall, it was a terrible experience. Very beautiful place but we highly regret coming here. If I can give a review of less than 1 I would.< /Review>< Pics>

<Text>My father passed away 2 weeks ago due to heart failure. We were told by Rose Hills that we would only be allowed a gravesite service with only 10 people for 15 minutes. My father is and was a wonderful man who devoted his entire life to his family and helping others. I know he wants his kids, grandkids and relatives to attend his services. We cannot tell his grandchildren and siblings that they cannot attend his funeral.
I read the Los Angeles order and it states no more than 10 people in a confined space. An outdoor gravesite service is not a confined space. Rose Hills is very insensitive to implement a 15 minute time limit on services. Not code its a Rose Hills rule.
My father is waiting at Rose Hills to be buried.
We were told that if we want more than 10 people to attend his funeral we will have to wait until covid is over. I asked them if I could schedule a tentative date for his services in June or July. They said no, unless it is 10 people. I am asking Rose Hills to allow us to bury our father soon. The minimal amount of direct family is 20 people with a gravesite service. This is breaking my family's hearts.< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1590678942742, 'text': 'Jenny, this is certainly not the impression we want to leave you with, and I am grateful that you reached out once again so that we may further address your concerns.

Just simply amazingly great, friendly, compassionate customer service from Veronica Fierro. After helping us do all funeral arrangements when my mom passed she’s helped us get our plots for the whole family and was so patient and willing to explain everything to us as many times as necessary never did she lose her patience or awesome attitude. This time around she’s  helping all my family with the planning of services,and all the other necessary stuff no matter what time we call her she’s always there to answer our questions and not only answer but she makes sure we understand everything being explained. She’s worked very late hours just to help us has come to where we are and most importantly she does it all with dedication and most importantly she helps us from the bottom of her heart and not only to make a commission on the sale. If I ever need any other service I’d definitely come back to her and I absolutely highly recommend anyone looking to start their funeral arrangements to make sure you ask for Veronica Fierro to help you. I promise you she’s the best and she will treat you as she’d expect  her or her family to be treated.</text>

<Text>Let me first start off by saying, that rose hills has gone down in there quality of service in there arraignments dept. Lack of training knowledge and the overall ability to care for there customers need to improve. Brittney and Todd however new, they are still learning. But common sense is lacking, when u make an I.D. on a deceased love one and they do not note it down..we have a problem..or u tell them to embalm your loved one and they fail to do this too..we have a problem. Rose hills is a business and there in business to make a profit and they will offer there condolences while at the same time trying to get u to purchase one of there burial packages that requires u to take out a small loan or start a go fund me page because it costs more money for u to die than to live..Rose Hills at one time was really great, but today I wont go back to them. Really disappointed but u can make the call.< /Text>< Pictures>

<Review>What a beautiful cemetery this is!  It took me by complete surprise!  The overall experience at Rose Hills was good, except for a small hiccup that was eventually fixed.  Our advisor Cecilia Chan worked with her supervisor Julie Lynn and resolved the issue for our family.  It was not easy, at least management recognized their own mistakes and took steps to remediate it.  Eventually, we did return to purchase our own funeral services.  Cecilia Chan and her supervisor Julie worked well together and took care of us, even though our schedules were not flexible.

In all honesty, I feel like they go above and beyond their services to comfort families.  From time to time, the grass around the headstone may cover the edges, and sometimes the flower vase is hard to remove. At these moments I feel ashamed of myself that it has taken me so long to visit my dad and to care for his grave. It brings me comfort to have one go to person to take care of all my needs. I can turn to Cecilia to have these issues fixed.

I highly recommend Rose Hills & the compassionate employees.<//Review>< pictures>

< Review>
I’m 45 and my wife was just shy of turning 43 when she lost her battle with cancer earlier this year...at this age, we don’t think about death, let alone prepare for our final resting spot.

A family member introduced me to Amy Tsai, a Rose Hills representative. Amy was there from start to finish...and has become family to me. She showed me properties to choose from, scheduled visitation & service arrangements, the burial and explained all the financials. Not necessary on her part, but Amy  was present for every scheduled event. She wanted to make sure everything went smoothly and with her help, everything did. THANK YOU Amy!...and thank you to everyone at Rose Hills for the wonderful service.

After things settled a bit, I contacted Amy for properties for my parents, who are alive and well...thank you Lord! It’s never too early to prepare for the inevitable death Rose Hills can help. I would recommend Amy Tsai to anyone. 🙏<//Review>

Mr. Jimmy Hope has provided us helpful information, particularly he fully understood what exactly we were looking for based on our budget and expectation. He was extremely thoughtful and provided us three different kinds of packages for us to chose from. What we likes Jimmy, was his professional knowledge and amicable courtesy; he truly listened and understand our needs.   Thank you very much for your service, JImmy! Please approach Jimmy Hope at Rose HIll if you ever plan to purchase plots or services.<//review>

<review>Would love to give credits to Veronica Fierro for all her hard work. She has an excellent empathetic,compassionate, extraordinary customer service etiquette, she treated us like family not only did she stay late at work to help us during our difficult time when we were trying to find a plot for my mother,but she’s also helped the family in finding a plot close to our mother’s plot. She went above and beyond to accommodate each and everyone of the family members needs and tried her best to make sure we all got the best deals possible and most important next to where our mother and uncle now rest.She is an amazing human being and employee that deserves to be recognized for her hard work. We are extremely pleased and appreciate all the help she’s given us, she always made herself available to answer any questions we’ve had or that come up as we plan all our future burials. She has made this a bit easier on us, by accommodating all our needs and having the compassion and empathy for us through this extremely difficult time. Veronica Fierro truly deserves an employee of the month award.

Rose Hills is indeed a beautiful cemetery I have several family members who are there. My Father In Law recently passed away and we are trying to lay him to rest with my Mother In Law. They are making this difficult. Rose Hills is trying to add on an almost additional $800 fee for a Funeral Director to be present for a direct burial of cremains. All we want to do is say our final goodbyes for a few minutes and watch them put him with his wife and they are persistent on this cost. The counselors name is Lupe, she even said we can get a Funeral Director of our own if we didn’t want to use theirs.  SHAME ON YOU!! Taking advantage of a grieving family. I even spoke with the mortuary we had made the arrangements with and they said they have never heard of such a thing. Be careful, look and listen because they will take advantage of your wallet.<//Text>

It is of the utmost importance to us to meet the needs of those we serve, and it's saddening that your impression of us didn't align with this. However, most mortuaries and cemeteries do have fees for scheduling and directing graveside services and witness interments, regardless of how many people are planning to attend.

My wife and I finalized the purchase of our property on September 12, 2019. Prior to the purchase we met with Mary Li, who asked what our needs were and concerns about pre-planning for the future. Mary explained the pros and cons of pre-planning versus at-need services.  After the tour of the facility, a possible location was selected, we decided to think about this property before pulling the trigger. Mary was very professional, answered all of are questions to our satisfaction, and there was no high pressure sales to complete the purchase on the initial visit. My wife and I were completely satisfied with Mary’s professionalism and the attention to our needs. Excellent customer service.</Text>

We have purchased two cemetery plots with their Pre-planning counselor, named Jimmy Hope. Mr. Jimmy has demonstrated a profound knowledge about the Pre-planning, and also he has input a data analysis for us to review how we can save money if we would purchase the cemetery plots earlier. We ended up purchasing two plots with ZERO Interest rate. I would recommend you to look for Mr. Jimmy if you would plan to purchase any cemetery plots or funeral packages.< /text>

People at Rose Hills, especially Joshua Liu guided us with great supports, details and services during those sorrowful days.

We recently needed funeral services and Rose Hills staff were very helpful with not only the basics but also very patient with all of our questions. Rose Hills was even kind enough to fix a misunderstanding from 5 years ago, even though it resulted in some financial loss. Julie Lin was especially helpful and provided constant updates while the issues were getting resolved. Cant say I want to return again soon, but they have definitely earned our trust through this experience.< /review>

I bought 2 plots in Rosehills for my wife and me many years ago and have been keeping on approached by the agents for services pre-planning until I met David Lau in the booth at the Square Market.

Thank you David for his professional advice and recommendation on pre-planning. He explained the plan to me and my wife in detail and listened to our needs patiently. We were happy with the plan and signed the contract with him on next day. Thank you David again for solving our long-termed problem in such a short period of time.</review>

David Young, Family Service Counselor
a. Rose Hills has always been the place my wife and I wanted to be laid to rest.
b. My wife met David Young at Rose Hills to make her arrangements.
c. David's knowledge of Rose Hills property and funeral services are very, very good.
d.David Young provided excellent service to our family with every aspect of the arrangements. He displaced thoughfulness , caring and sensitivity throughout.

I will recommend David Young, FSC, at Rose to anyone especially to other family members and friends and ask for him at the arrangement building FSC department.<//Text>

The cemetery and mortuary is operated by the City of Whittier. I have had many visits over the years when family members, friends and their relatives passed away. They have always provided professional service and the Park is kept in good conditions. Be careful when bringing small children to visit. A few years ago a nearby brush fire caused by an automobile accident, has disturbed wildlife habitats nearby. There are packs of coyotes roaming about the park sometimes.</review>

I am a true believer that God doesn't make mistakes and he will send earthly angels  to help guide and support you during difficult times.  I know factually that God sent Diane Brooks on my path, although I did not realize when we met what capacity God would use her, but in the matter of months I would need her more than I could have ever imagined. When I initially met Diane, she educated me on the importance pre-planning, at that time I did not want to discuss the possibility or plan anyone in my family's funeral, purchase plots are anything of that nature. However, I am so grateful that she was passionate about educating me passed my discomfort of the topic as I needed her sooner than I thought. My close relative received an unexpected diagnosis that ended her life quicker than our family expected. Diane Brooks supported me through the process from start to finish. She traveled to me during those days where I just did not have the strength or energy to make it out the Rosehills with no hesitation, I called her day and night with questions and she was always willing to help. Diane was first person I called when my relative passed at 4a.m. and she not only handled the business part of the process, she supported me through the emotional areas as well. Diane Brooks will be embedded in the hearts of our family as we will never forget all of her support. I  am so thankful to Diane Brooks and all of the Rosehills staff who supported our family during this time.

Thank you Diane Brooks</text>

<text>Rose Hills has been very accommodating to all of our needs for funeral and burial services. Our representative Joshua Liu was very helpful and provided exceptional customer service. It was a pleasure working with Joshua in helping planning my mother in law & father in laws funeral. This was a very hard time for me and my family and they showed love and compassion since day one. The prices are very reasonable and they go above and beyond the call of duty to make sure your happy and your arrangements are fulfilled. They also offer payment plans and make the process as simple as possible. My wife and I also started pre-planning and have also purchased plots. I would highly recommend Rose Hills funeral home for your loved ones memorial or funeral service. And ask for Joshua Liu if you want to get taken care of. Joshua walked us through every step of the way and we really appreciate the hard work and dedication he took in helping us get through this.  Thank you Joshua & Rose Hills for giving my family peace.< /text>< pics>

This place has a very large pasture and space for family and friends to remember the passing ones. However, you will lose your cellphone signal up the hills, so you better remember how to drive to the exit as you come inside. Plus, the roads here are not well labeled or distinguished from each other, so you have to depend on yourself or the ones that came out with you for directions.<//text>

1 month ago:  The most incompetent staff I have ever worked with. From the first encounter with arranger Joel Roman, "any questions or concerns,call me anytime, I am here for you." What a LIE!! He is just a Rose Hills salesman. He never did take any calls from me, though 4 other "arrangers" I spoke with were not very helpful at all. But, they will call you  early in the morning on payment due date! There seems to be such a disconnection of communication among the staff. If you want specifics, I kept notes and can name quite a few incidents that happened.  Even today...the death certificate, which was scheduled to be mailed, is at their office waiting to be picked up by me, though I live out of state. Such incompetence!  My opinion, The ONLY thing they have going for them is the beautiful  grounds.< /review>

I visited my father's cache yesterday for Veterans and found all the markers full of cobwebs and grass. I admit it has been six months since visiting last and I may have gone in between cleanings but it definitely was not acceptable the way it looked. The pond was so green and full of trash floating.<//text>

If you are looking for someone who is compassionate and patient just ask for her. It took me numerous days to make a decision and each day I spen multiple hours going through the entire cemetery sometimes twice and Adelle never rushed me or made me feel uncomfortable for being so indecisive. She is the only employee at rose hills that I will deal with no disrespect to the rest. Adelle is extremely knowledgeable about all pre need information as well as funeral pre need.

<text>My name is Mario Torres, and I lost my mom this year on August 7, 2019. Planning for my mom's burial never crossed mine nor my sisters mind but following procedure we were first guided to the Chapel of Memories who than referred us to Veronica Fierro of Rose Hills. Veronica was very respectful and understanding of our grieving while she walked through each step to provide my mom with a beautiful service. I am sure all the counselor's/advisors there at Rose Hills are trained to comfort mourning patrons, but Veronica Fierro was the clounselor/advisor there for me and my sister during our time of need.
Thank you,
Veronica Fierro</text>< gmap_id>

<Review>Beautiful landscaping and easy to get to. Have 2 loved ones buried here. The viewing room and seating was clean,  plenty of room for guests,  nice koi pond with soothing waterfall outside for those who need a some fresh air during services.  Aside from a few sales reps that could benefit from a training class on etiquette in working with grieving family the selection of services were acceptable. During the funeral they had a long wait to get more dirt to fill the hole to bury the cremated remains which was awkward yet the gentleman overseeing the process was professional, sympathetic and polite.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

<rate>5< /rate><review>Where do I begin? I was referred to Diane Brooks by a friend and I have to say she was truly a gift from God! Initially we were introduced to discuss the option of preplanning and like most I was hesitant and reluctant to think about or talk about death. However, I am very happy and lucky that I decided to go through with preplanning memorial services and purchasing a burial plot.

When I met Diane she took her time to answer every question that I had even the ones I may have asked several times. She was patient compassionate and truly has a great love for what she does. She throughly walked me through the process from beginning to end! Shortly after purchasing, my mother passed away and I realized how great of a decision I had made. Everything went just ask Diane said it would and she was kind enough to follow up with us through every step of the process to ensure that things went smoothly.

As uncomfortable as it may seem or sound  I recommend everyone consider preplanning. Not only does it take a load off your entire family, it will also allow you to make decisions and choose all memorial or burials options upfront. I was an emotional wreck after losing my mother and having everything already picked out before her passing allowed me to grieve her as peacefully as possible, given the circumstances, without having to make tough decision at the time of her death. Truly the best decision I could have ever made!

I am a firm believer in God and I can't thank him enough for bringing Ms. Diane into my life at such a critical time. I pray that he blesses her for being such a blessing to my entire family. Not only was she amazing, but so were each of her colleagues at Rose Hills who made an unpleasant situation such as death, as pleasant as possible with their caring and compassionate demeanor.

Thank you to everyone that I encountered at Rose Hills!

My beloved dad is buried at the rainbow gardens section, It's right by the lake that also has duck's and fishes swimming all day. It's a beautiful place to visit, peaceful, well maintain, and very clean. I go every week and keep his grave among the most decorated always! I enjoy every time I'm there bottom line I'm happy to have chosen this site for my dad and future burials as well.</Review>

<review>My love one’s funeral was on April 2019 elsewhere. After attending several grief share groups to cope with this great loss, I thought I was done with the funeral arrangements. As the ashes of the love of my life need to Rest In Peace in God’s garden, Veronica Paz from Rose Hills helped me and guided me to acquire the property and make the arrangements of the burial of her ashes at an affordable price. The care of Veronica Paz and her professional service helped me not to feel the same pain I experience back in April while I was making all arrangements for the funeral of the love of my life. Verona Paz is the best at Rose Hills. Thanks Vero.</review>< pics>

We have everything preplaned with Rose Hills.
But Adele Soriano offered us the travel protection plan.
This was exactly what we needed since we are retired and enjoyed traveling.
This is an added peace of mind that we really appreciate.
We definitely would recommend other people to contact her.
She is knowledgeable , patient, accommodating and carring.

<Text>10 Stars for the Wonderful staff person in the truck who helped us find the grave we were looking for. We had never been there before. We were only asking him where we had to go to get a map or some information.
We showed him what we had...All he said was "follow me".  We followed him in his truck and then followed him more as he trudged up the hill to the exact grave we were looking for. It would be so nice if everyone was as helpful as he is.

3 Stars for having to wait over 10 minutes in the Flower Shop to make a simple purchase on a $10 bunch of flowers.
3 Stars on how long it must have been since they have trimmed the Headstones.</Text><Name>R L< /Name>< UserId.>

<review>This is the first time that I have felt the need to write a review on something.
My mom passed suddenly on Jan 1.
It was devastating.
David Young, Family Service Counselor at Rose Hills was and is a godsend.
At this extremely trying time, I believe David went way above and beyond the call of duty.
Due to his caring and understanding of my situation, he was able to make an unbearable day a little more livable.
I thank you David and the staff at Rose Hills.<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

I went to visit both my parents gravesites today 11/24/18. They are both buried side by side. It was the worst experience since both their deaths. I was in disbelief at what I saw. Such an eye sore. I have so many family members buried here & to think how both my parents worked so hard because they both were determined to be buried here. The maintenance is absolutely terrible! & I will not be recommending Rose Hills to anyone anymore. I went home depressed & disappointed.

Had difficulty finding my parents gravesites. Not well marked at all. Came from out of state.
Went to my nephews  service Asked to have air conditioning turned up. it was warm. was told no.
Everything had a hidden cost and a lot of misquotes on price.  Get everything in writing initially. Thankfully my niece did because they wanted more money later.
Will hopefully never have to do business with Rose Hills ever again< /text>

< Review>
My mother-in-law recently passed away, and my family had already made arrangements to have her cremated with another funeral home. Unfortunately the funeral home we chose did not have options for the urn for her remains, so we decided to call Rose Hills to inquire about purchasing an urn.

BIG MISTAKE.

I was very clear over the phone that I was not looking to make any arrangements; I only wanted to browse and purchase an urn. The man I spoke to was named Robert Fox, and initially he seemed very friendly and helpful and told me to come in right away and he would be able to help me out in purchasing an urn

My husband, his brother, and I went immediately and as we arrived, Robert greeted us and lead us to the showroom where the urns were on display. As soon as we entered the room, he turns to us and tells us that we might be better off purchasing an urn on Amazon or Costco because it would be cheaper. Respectfully, we explained that we had already done some browsing, but wanted to see some urns in person, and that if we saw one we liked we would purchase it, regardless of the price.

We did end up finding an urn we really liked, but wanted to look at one other place my husband had seen, and politely told Robert that we would discuss as a family and most likely return the next day to purchase. Once again, Robert suggested we look online because of the price, which we did end up doing, but we couldnt find one similar enough to the one we saw at Rose Hills.

The next day my husband, his aunt, and I returned to Rose Hills ready to purchase the urn. We asked for Robert and told him our intention. He said he would get the paperwork started and disappeared for some time. When he returned, he informed us that they were out of stock and that they would have to order it for us, and that it wouldn't be in until the following Thursday or Friday.

We were okay with this timeframe, and asked if we could pay in advance or put down a security deposit to ensure the urn would be ours. Robert said no, that we should pay when the urn arrives in stock. He took down my number and said he would call us as soon as it arrived in stock. We never received a call back, and it is already past the timeframe he gave us.

At the end of the day, it was obvious that they did not want to sell to us because we did not have my mother-in-law's services with them.

I normally wouldn't mind this, but what bothers me is that instead of telling us this was a policy, they led us on and wasted our time and energy. We are already grieving the loss of someone extremely important, and the lack of professionalism and outright deception from Rose Hills is disgusting.

I do not recommend this place in any sense of the word and would caution anyone to trust them with handling their loved ones final arrangements.</Review>

Today I met my dad! Unfortunately it is 10 years too late.
I love this Memorial park because it has beautiful green grass and the grounds are kept up. If you need help finding a grave site, the people at the office are most helpful. Also, if you're at a site and it's overgrown or you cannot locate or open a flower hold, just let them know and a maintenance person shows up right away to fix any issues. Over all, a very nice place.< /text>

2 months ago my family and I had to bury my grandmother. The woman that we saw to make arrangements with was such a rude and nasty person. Her name is Heidi Gonzales. My mother didn't  understand the nearly 1600 dollar charge for overhead and so she asked Heidi to plz explain. She answered my mother as if she had a learning disability or if my mother was a little girl. If you have no choice to go here avoid this horribly woman. I never would of expected to be treated this way at such a tragic time in mine and my family's life.< /review>

Was looking for where my great grandparents were buried.  They were very helpful.  Found both from 1959 and 1962.
Really appreciate it.

<Text>Losing a loved one is no laughing matter, but Rose Hills made me wish I was the one who died instead of my dear aunt.  I live 400 miles away and had great difficulty in dealing with Rose Hills.  I was only trying to bury my aunt's ashes on top of her husband who had died 30 years earlier.  Besides all the paperwork, legal forms, etc., they insisted on full payment at least a week before the burial.  Since I was from out of town, they wanted a cashier's check too.  I paid and the burial actually went well.  However, it then took them more than 12 weeks to fabricate the new headstone with my aunt's name on it.  Therefore, after insisting on full payment, they didn't deliver all they promised until 13 weeks after payment.  They have beautiful grounds, but the management in in the internment office stinks.  A very poorly run organization with no compassion for those who have lost a loved one.<//Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

WARNING! ACHTUNG!  Run, don't walk out of this place.   A Rose Hill (RH)Agent quoted almost 50% higher than Renaker, an independently owned Funeral Home in Buena Park.  Obviously I went with Renaker.

I felt I was being played for a fool.  So I called Customer Service @ RH and explained the situation.  1.5 hours later some other salesman was trying to explain how they are the Cadillac of the Funeral Home business; hence the 50% premium increase.  If you want the Cadillac of a cremation service, make sure to call them. They will definitely siphon all your hard earned cash.

So the lesson here is; don't believe the BS.  Be smart and obtain multiple quotes.  My next steps are the BBB & filing a complaint with U.S. AG Xavier Becerra.< /review>

Certainly it's a world class pretty park, but before you purchased any grave there,
must be really think well , is a sure deal for you or your love one for eternally rest place.
unfortunately my sweet sister purchased for the family use. , but we have change plan,
and decided transfer title.. RoseHills were charge us fee 25% up of our original purchase cost.
my family feeling been robbed.
Yes my parents and Grand parents were buried there..,  but that place now giving me creepy
and dirty greedy taste.<//review>

They moved my daughter's head stone down 24 inches from where it was when I burried her without any notification as to why. Exposed my daughter's coffin vault when tjey dug the burial place for the person above her. Explanation to me. "I don't know why they burried the person so close or dug the dirt that close to her grave site" That's it. Anyone kbow who I can repirt this to. Taking property after its sold is a crime, isn't it? I do believe so.  While preparing fir the service I selected a memory card with Asian scripture. I was told by my supposed rep. Oh no, you don't want that one, ONLY ASIAN people like that one. Well I be darn, she just excluded that I am 1/2 Japanese. It was the worst experience and I wish it on no one else. So that's why the one. Oh, did I mention they remived the head stone without my notification and when I asked what happened to it, Yes, they had to send someone to the spit to verify eventhough I had pictures. Then told me there isn't a work order and they'll have to get back with me". I understand why now. They needed to cirrect their error of placement, i.e the 24 inches downward move. This place is horrible😞😢. Made someone I know keep their parent above ground because they messed up their paperwork. Had nerves to place on the casket, family redused for burial! Almost 2hrs in the hot sun did their mother sit, in the casket, until someone fron their administarion could resolve that issue. You know what happened to the corspe! Just imagine. They don't keep corspe in the freezer for nothing.< /Text>

My dad is buried at rosehills. Everything was paid for. There staff is so horrible. There rude inconsiderate and ever since they have new owners it's all about the $ $ $.  I know you need a cemetery when you die.
Really think twice about
rosehills. There staff messes up everything paperwork burial site ashes. Please go elsewhere for a cemetery.  It might look beautiful but believe me they chopped down the rose garden they had. If you choose this place Rosehills be prepared to be misplaced ripped off and treated like a Idiot for catching them when there staff is wrong. They will turn the tables on you. My dad is there and when it's time my mom will  be there.  But I won't Hell no. I'm going elsewhere.< /Text>

< Review>
Hello
I just wanted to highlight the friendly service I recently received by one of your employees.  As I was struggling to clean my husband's gravesite, I was approached by one of your employees named Oscar.  He offered to help me clean it and cut the grass around the headstone.  I asked him if I needed to pay him and of course he said no.  He not only edged the headstone, but also edged the flower vase too.  He took good care of my flowers and made sure I was far way so as to not get hurt from the flying debri.  It was such a plesure to see someone who enjoys their job.  Thank you!<//Review>

<review>(Translated by Google) 2021;may. Dear mom. Even today, nostalgic, Rose Hills Motuary. I go to the place where my mother's body was buried to give flowers to her longing and nostalgic report. Breaking up in the world like this and breaking up with me. In sadness and longing. Tears keep flowing because I came to the ugly child. Cleaning the tombstone. our mom. I miss you, I'm in tears. I tried to put it away because it was useless in my home garden, but lemon blossoms bloomed after 7 years. Jujube persimmons and tomatoes that slowly bloom in the garden, all of which became memories with my mother. My beloved mother. I. I didn't know why. Mom is. It's a great gift from God to me. still. In such a close place. To this calm and beautiful Rose Hill. I am happy to be able to come often.

(Translated by Google) Although I didn't know much about my mom, she chose this place as a place for her elderly to sleep instead of burying her father, but it is understandable that she chose it because of the beautiful environment here.

雖然不太了解老媽最後選了這裡做為她老人家的長眠之地而非和老爹合葬，但是可以理解因為這裡的優美環境，所以她選了這兒。< /Text>
