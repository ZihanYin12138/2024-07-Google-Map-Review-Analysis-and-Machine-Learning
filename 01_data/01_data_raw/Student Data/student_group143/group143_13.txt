<Time>1617423448932</Time><Rate>5</Rate><text>My vet recommended that I bring my Greyhound here, as she was limping and possibly had a groin injury needing physical therapy. I called Companion and was able to get an appointment quickly. I dropped off copies of my greyhound's Xrays in advance, and Dr Knox did a physical exam of her to see where she was reacting to pain.  They diagnosed her with a groin injury and recommended that we do a few sessions of laser therapy, which they were able to start that day. It was easy to schedule the future therapies. They have been so nice to my Shadow, and everything has gone smoothly so far. We are only 2 visits in, with at least 8 more to go, but I am happy to have my greyhound in their care.  Today the tech was so nice, when he brought her back out to my car. We had a quick chat, and I thanked him for helping her. He was kind and I was happy that he had been able to pet her, while she had her laser therapy session today.<//text>< pictures>

I have been a client since I got my new dog back in Feb. Very friendly, courteous staff. Specially now with COVID, they really do go the extra mile. Dr. Knox is awesome as well. I go there regularly to get food. Please be thankful to the staff. They are frontline heroes. They care for our babies.</text>

My 4 year old American Staff Terrier has gotten 2 TPLO surgeries with Dr. Knox. First surgery was October 2020, I had a lot of questions for them before and after her surgery. The staff and Dr. Knox answered all my questions,  their knowledge, professionalism and compassion made the recovery less stress full. Second surgery was 2 days ago, I know my dog is in great hands. If you love your pets and want the best treatment for them, this center is the place. Thank you Dr. Knox and staff for taking great care of my dog Piper.</Text>

This review is not based on the knowledge of the vet, but on the service and overall care. I will give the pros and con of my experience.
Pros: easy to get appointments, even at last minute for emergencies (within business hours). Staff is pleasant. Prices are comparable. Patient and willing to answer many questions
Cons: poor communication. Almost zero follow up. Vague diagnostics, need to probe to get a thorough understanding of findings.
One of my experiences: They agreed to see my cat without apps. on a Monday. He had been vomiting all weekend and stopped eating Sunday. I got a call early afternoon saying they needed to do blood work and x-rays. I agreed to x-rays, and if they couldn't find the problem to do the blood work.
After x-rays I was told by he appeared to have swelling of the pancreas, diagnosis pancreatitis.
When I went to pick him up, they told me to come at 5 which is closing time, the Dr. came out and reaffirmed the diagnosis. He explained the medicine he was giving me would be for inflammation and one for appetite. He said there would be one for vomiting, but then after I ask for clarification of administering the meds., he said there were 2 and one of them would help with the vomiting. I had to ask a bunch of questions about why he thought it was pancreatitis and not a blockage or diabetes or something else. He didn't explain the seriousness of the diagnosis At all.
The next day, my cat was still not eating, it was the 3rd day without food. My research said it is very serious if cats don't eat after 3 days. I called the vet wanting to know what I was really dealing with. I wanted to know if I was going to have to euthanize as he was rapidly declining and I had found out from personal research how serious this was. I spoke to a tech who was very nice, calmed me down and said to just relax and be with my cat and not project stress on him, but to just be comforting. The vet would call me back later. He did not call back.
I called again the next day, day 4 of my cat not eating. He was now just lying on the floor looking like road kill. Vet finally called me later that day. Just before he did, my cat had finally had something to eat. I continued all meds. and he got back to normal. After that last call I had no follow up from the vet.
Forward to 5 weeks later, my cat starts vomiting and crying again. I call the vet right when office opens to see what I should do. The receptionist says vet will call later that afternoon, or by 5. At 5 I called back ND was told I was 3rd on the call back list. He NEVER called me back. This is a serious life threatening chronic problem my cat is having and his vet is doing NOTHING!
This is just one experience. The vet handed lacerations on my other cat great, but then gave me antibiotics for another cat that had hair loss on his nose and said "let's see if this works" basically didn't know what it was but if the meds. worked it meant it was an infection.
Hope this gives you enough info. to make an informed decision.< /text>

They offer affordable prices while providing excellent quality services. I've taken my babies here to get their shots, exams, and dental cleaning/teeth extractions, and every time was a good experience. I must also mention that my chihuahuas are extremely misbehaved and terrified of strangers/new places/new things, and sometimes act out aggressively when they are scared. Despite their behavioral challenges, the staff and vet are always very patient and gentle with them, and are able to get my dogs to calm down and relax. I highly recommend this place. Will  be sad to have to switch to another clinic when I move back to Arizona.</Review><pics>None</pics>< response>

<Text>I have two pets and working with a Veterinarian who is compassionate and takes the time to understand your pets is important.  Dr Knox D.V.M is that Doctor!  The staff were welcoming, professional and kind. It was a really great experience overall.  Scheduled a tooth cleaning for my VERY Shy Cat who handled the general exam far better than I expected...Dr Knox handled him with care and kindness and for a 9 year old cat, he did really great!  So Happy!  Making an appointment was simple and the facility was very nice and clean. Great overall!  Ten Stars out of Ten!  Your family of pets will thank you for visiting too!<//Text>< response>

Sarah Jilka is doing such a fantastic job providing community support and outreach through the Ani-meals Program to pet parents affected by COVID-19. You just get an appointment time and drive up pop your trunk and her team fills your trunk with a 2 wk supply of pet food and groceries. They put a slip of paper in with your goodies that tells you when you are eligible to re-submit form.

I brought our aggressive cat to Dr. Knox after a poor experience at another vet. Dr. Knox was very helpful and tried to explain my cat's subjective experience to us so that I could help get into his mindset and help him relieve some of his stress and stop acting aggressive. He also prescribed a course of treatment to help him get along with our other cats. The results were almost immediate and the aggressive behavior has almost completely gone. Thanks Dr. Knox for listening to our concerns and empathetically helping us to better understand our little buddy!< /text>

Dr. Knox is great. They listen to all concerns, give advice, and don't try to game you for more money. I asked if a particular procedure needed to be done (I had previously been told it would have to be done semi-regularly) and they said it was not necessary, even though they could have just said it was and tacked it on to the bill. Front desk staff is helpful as far as insurance is concerned (plus they're just nice people).< /Review>

<Text>I have been bringing my six year old dog to Dr. Knox since she was a puppy, and it has been a wonderful experience every visit. The staff are friendly and you can tell they love animals as much as Dr. Knox does. They always know who me and my dog are, and usually will come out to say “hi” to my dog while I’m in the waiting room. Dr. Knox is an amazing veterinarian; he is gentle, honest and genuinely wants to help in any way possible. Doug is great, too! We love Companion Animal Clinic!</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

Love Dr. Knox and his staff, been going there for years! He is so honest and caring doesn't push anything on you and always takes such time with you making sure you and your pets are comfortable,  makes sure all your questions are answered.  Never feel rushed and always feel like I can walk away feeling confident in everything that was done and talked about. Would give more stars if I could!< /Review>

The vet who saw me and my dog, didnt seem to care much. My dog was suffering from a food allergy. He wouldnt find the source.He didnt even use his educational background to make a diagnosis. He wanted me to do 500.00 worth of testing. So i went home and looked at every ingredient in my dog food. Eliminated the chicken and boom. 500.00 cheaper. And all i had to do was pay attention.</review>

I wanted to wait until we had visited Companion Pet Clinic a few times before writing a review. Total to date - we have had 2 scheduled appointments for our Golden Retriever puppy (Stella) and 1 unplanned visit. The staff are warm, friendly and reflective of Dr. Knox himself who will immediately put you right at ease.  This is a small clinic with reasonable pricing and no up-selling of unnecessary services or products. My wife and I are so happy we found Dr. Knox and Companion Pet Clinic; and know Stella will receive the best possible care in the years to come. When we took Stella's Rabies vaccination paperwork to the Humane Society for registration - we communicated to the front desk Stella was being cared for by Dr. Knox and Companion Pet Clinic; and were told Dr. Knox has routinely volunteered his time at the Center and they echoed what we had already experienced with his kindness and dedication.< /text>

We had our dog get clawed by a feral cat and his throat started to swell up. They got us in first thing and gave him a shot and cleaned the area. He is better and the staff really seemed to care and let us know what to expect. Thank you.
Also had our new rescue kitten spayed and again treated very well and given all the info we needed to keep her healthy while she recovered. Thanks again.< /review>

I find the staff at Companion Animal Clinic to be professional,  personable and thorough. From the friendly greeting when I walk through the door through follow up phone calls, it's clear they want to make sure my pets issues are resolved in a timely manor. I never feel rushed or my input glossed over. It's comforting to know their skilled and compassionate services are a phone call away.</Text>

Awesome, it's a small Clinic there's no long Waits and the people are great. I love dr. Knox he was sweet knowledgeable good with my cat and my overall is a 5. + Stars. They got me in the same day which help relieve my tension about my cat. These folks are really nice you can't go wrong as far as I'm concerned, and first-time customers . have a half price for first visits coupon on their website all you have to do is show them on your phone.< /review>

Dr. Knox is kind, efficient, knowledgeable, and readily available.  He helped wean Mathilda from medication she had been taking for many years, and seems to be thriving.

It doesn't solve all of the problems but on your next visit please feel free to request that you be charged out while in the exam room.

<review>Dr. Knox and his staff are the best! I have been taking my pets to them for many years and continue to recommend them to family and friends. Dr. Knox has always made himself available to my furry family, even if it's just to answer my questions. When my cat had breast cancer he and his staff took excellent care of her and helped to extend her life and give us precious extra time with her. My dogs love Dr. Knox and are always thrilled to try and coax an extra treat or two out of the Good Dr. I could not recommend Companion Animal Clinic more highly.</review>< pics>

Can't imagine any worse customer service! Had an appointment for our 2 dogs, got there 15 minutes early, opted to wait outside as the waiting room was way to small. Was given a paper to fill out and I did so. returned to the receptionist who said she'd be right out to talk to us, never happened. we left at 10:15. No matter how good the Dr. is, it is useless if the front help is lacking. No stars, very poor service.< /Review>

While we try to remain on schedule, sometimes our schedule is unexpectedly altered. Yesterday was one of those days. Our day got extremely hectic almost immediately due to our clients and patients needing more time than we anticipated. Along with several emergencies, we had a very difficult time holding to our appointment schedule.\nThat said, thank you for taking the time to provide your input. I have spoken to my front desk team in order to get a more complete understanding of the situation and we have analyzed your experience to see how we can improve the care of our clients, both old and new. I have full confidence in our front desk team and I know how much they care about our clients and our patients.\nIt is clear that we should have been in better communication with you while you were waiting and we have created a protocol that can better address situations similar to yours. Obviously, we always want our clients to be happy and satisfied when they leave here. But, we missed the mark in your case. I try to make sure that each of my clients and furry family members gets all of the attention that each of them requires and deserves. Sometimes, however, that makes it difficult to remain on schedule.\nThank you, once again for taking the time to provide you honest feedback and for helping us to become better. - Dr Knox'}< /Resp><gmapID>0x80dbf38029acf629:0x604bd142ef904d36<//gmapID></record>

<review>I need to preface this review with the fact that, after this experience, Dr. Knox did call us to try and sort out all that had happened. That being said, I would like to help prevent others from having the experience that we did at Companion Animal Clinic. My husband and I made an appointment for our puppy to be neutered, six weeks in advance. We had a small time frame to work with; knowing only one of us could be home with him while he recovered. The Companion Animal Clinic was neither forthcoming nor informative when we expressed that we were cautious, and admittedly over protective, “first time” parents. We were not given the full details of what to expect the day of surgery, though we called twice leading up to the appointment asking for information. We dropped off our dog at 8:15AM, under the impression that he would be done and ready to go home within a matter of two to two and a half hours. 10:30 rolls around and we haven’t heard anything from the clinic. We were very worried, very concerned. We called and they said he was just sitting in a kennel, waiting. At this point, our dog had been without food and water for twelve hours and the clinic said, they “just hadn’t gotten around to him yet.” They then, for the first time in all of our contact in six weeks, explained they didn’t perform surgeries except for between the hours of 12-3pm. We were upset, knowing that our dog had been brought in early for what Dr. Knox calls “acclimating” when he really should have been at home with us if they were not ready for him. We decided to wait, anticipating that because we made the appointment so far in advance, our dog would surely be operated on first and we would hear something soon. However, it was 12:45 when we called again to check and they still had not started surgery. We opted to come and pick up our dog, where after verbal abuse and disrespect from the front office staff, Dr. Knox came out with our dog, who had just been “mildly sedated” in preparation for the “surgery he was about to go into.” Like I say, Dr. Knox did call us, after I emailed expressing my disappointment. And I appreciate his attempt to explain his office’s procedures, though I wish he had issued an apology instead of claiming the “miscommunication on both parties” was the reason for this incident. However, nothing can change the fact that we felt uncomfortable with the experience, with the level of professionalism, and the overall lack of communication and lack of respect the Companion Animal Clinic seems to have for its clients. If you are a pet parent who likes to be kept in the know, have concrete details and know what’s happening with your pet while out of your care, I would recommend staying away from Companion Animal Clinic.< /review>< Pics>

My dog is not easy for a vet to deal with.  Dr. Knox has always been able to tackle the issues and resolve the problems.  So, while my dog still has anxiety going to the vet, I don't because I know that my dog's problems will be dealt with successfully.< /Text>

<Review>It seemed like a reasonably priced vet. Dr. Knox and tech were very informative and patient seemed very caring in the 1st and 2nd encounter.   But then Dr. Knox was scheduled to be out for the next appointment and we would be seeing another Dr.   It went all down hill on that visit, claimed there was no appointment, that it was actually canceled by receptionist, since the inititual treatment was not successful, we called to see if we could be seen before the next scheduled appointment if they had a cancellation or opening sooner, which they did immediately the same day. Went to appointment got a large $$$$ quote, needef to talk it through with family, decided to get antibiotic to see if that treatment would clear up condition, but keep same next appointment date already scheduled, we all agreed in exam room to do that.  Got antibiotic, was explained amount to be given and we left.  Well the medicine needed to be refrigerated, was not informed of that! Didn't realize it, until saw it on the counter and it had seperated?! Then even with my progressive lenses to 225 magnification, could hardly make out it needed to be regridgerated. Well can't use it any more to treat. When get into office, they said didn't have an appoint sceduled, and didn't show yhey cancelled it bevause if their proceedure, if come in before that appiintment its cancelled and repkaced with the appointment you had. It would be extra $54.00 on top of regular visit cost for tjus appointment.  Just like with human medical iffices do, and it's on the box that the medicine needs to be refridgerated, hthis wad some middle aged stout short woman I've never seen or met before.  She is brass and rude. I'm in the medical and dental field, and that us not how it's handled or extra charged, which I told her. Also, any medications or oral treatment products the asdistant, nurse, physicuan or pharmacists tells you that in the first part of instruction, then asks if there are any questions.  So we are looking for another vet to treat our beloved pet!!!  If you go here, adk a lit of questions, hopefully you can think of them all, so you won't feel so badly treated in the end.</Review><pics>None<//pics>< response>
{'time': 1515703940911, 'text': 'Dear Mrs White,\nPlease accept my apology that you had a negative experience at our clinic in my absence. That is obviously not our intent and I have spoken with everyone regarding your concerns. Please allow me to address some of your concerns. Your appointment time was really nothing more than a misunderstanding. When someone reschedules an appointment our usual protocol is to cancel the current appointment. However, you needed to come in before your scheduled appointment. Our receptionist cancelled your existing appointment, assuming (reasonably so) that your needs had been met. While I, honestly, don’t remember saying that I expected you to keep your previously scheduled appointment, I know that we made accommodations to be able to see you when you came in.\n\nRegarding the antibiotic, I am sorry that you weren’t told specifically that it needed refrigeration. We normally tell clients to keep it refrigerated, however, we certainly may have forgotten in your case. Because of the possibility that we may fall to human error, we put stickers on the box, in a standard font, stating the need for refrigeration. The manufacturer’s leaflet in the box has the same information.  Due to your situation, I have added “Keep Refrigerated” to the standard prescription label for that particular medication. Hopefully, these measures will prevent anyone else from having the problem you had.\n\nI’m afraid you completely misunderstood the cost of the appointment. It was not $54.00 in addition to the normal $61.00 visit fee. It was $54.00 instead of the $61.00 fee. This is our fee for follow-up exams. We charge a discounted fee for progress exams.\n\nI truly believe that the vast majority of this situation is simple an unfortunate series of misunderstandings, for which I apologize. However, I must take issue of your attack of my Office Manager. While you are no longer happy with our care, there is absolutely no need to denigrate her with\nyour perception of her physical appearance,  age, or anything else. As adults, we can disagree and still be respectful. If you felt that she was “brass & rude”, OK. I know her well and I am very familiar with how she interacts with clients. She is neither “brass” nor “rude” and after speaking with other people that overheard the conversation, I am very comfortable standing firmly behind her.\n\nOnce again, I’m sorry that you had a negative experience with us but there are quite a number of very qualified veterinarians in the area. I truly wish you well in finding someone that you are comfortable with.\nRespectfully,\nDr Knox'}<//response>

Thank you also for acknowledging our staff. They are great people and an honor to work with. I realize that we can be seen as a bit pricey. But, I feel that it is important to use our pricing structure for several things. (1) To make sure that we have the high quality equipment and medications that I believe our patients deserve. (2) To make sure that my great team are compensated fairly for their time and loyalty to me and the practice through reasonable pay and benefits. (3) To allow myself to be able to obtain the education needed to continue to improve the quality and breath of medicine that my patients deserve. We're not the most expensive but certainly not the cheapest. My greatest hope is that you feel that you have, at a minimum, received the service that you have paid for.

the vet is here for the money, first visit started out with a check up. Not a sociable vet,especially to my dog, but the job is done. Nothing great but really not a bad experience. Follow up visit for more vaccines, I told the doctor no parvo vaccine because she survive parvo and my last vet told me you wouldn't be needing that vaccine. I like my last vet, had to move to escondido, this is the closest vet. The vet argued the point that it parvo could return, but i insisted no parvo vaccine. when I went to pay there was the parvo vaccine charge. I spoke to the vet, he taught it was the best interest for the dog. I told him i won't pay for something i didn't ask for. after a few discussion (arguing)
he told me do what you think is best, you could pay for the service, or don't either way it is okay with him.  I didn't pay for the parvo vaccine. I didn't want to return to
this vet, but my dog seems bother about his right ear. I had a choice see the urgent clinic which had 3 of the best vet or this vet,. I choice this vet, thinking how could he screw this up, it's the right ear and a hell cheaper. This vet when through all the normal visit check up and low and behold he found the right ear to be infected. Wow, I told him that when we walk in. Then he prescribe a procedure that need to be done and a medication that my dog would need. Gave me the cost, $1500.00. I smile and said thank you but no thanks. He insisted that my dog needs this now. I smile and said you wouldn't be doing some other vet will if my dog needs it. He said well i prescribe mometamax  and see if it helps her. The cost for 15g $60.00. I later found out it only cost $19.99.. Anyways i agreed to try the mometamax. His assistant took my dog back to start the treatment and when he came back my dog is shaking his head and wiping his left ears on my leg. The assistant began to tell me to treat the left ear once a day. I stop him and said it is the right ear, he argue that the vet said left and he is the vet so he knows what ear is infected. I ask to to speak to the vet, as he came in the room, he stop turn and said my bad when i was facing to the dog i taught it was the left it's the right ear, and then he said jokingly i wouldn't charge for the cleaning of the left ear. Now my dog has both ears with mometamax. One ear don't need it, My bad is not an apology, sarcastic remark of not charging me is not call for. Anyways he does his job but he seems like he is doing extra things to gain more profit not is not necessary. His bedside manners there is none. So if you have no clue what is wrong with your dog this is not the vet for you.</review>

I told them he never had UTI in his life..He had been screened 5 months prior for one., Immediately after the catheter there was extreme tissue discharge and continuous incontinence UTI and lose of bowls.Its still up in the air whether they did bladder damage, or more spinal cord damage. This was approximately 6 months ago. It still continues. My house is a cesspool, my dogs pride is gone.
The "doctor" (knox) tried to make things right, but I feel like it was only out of his own self preservation. He  not passionate about what he does at all. Its just a business to him, in my eyes anyway. He really needs to work on his bedside manner,. At least with the older animals.. I am now planning on having him do the only thing he is able to do, put the final nail in my poor dogs coffin..I hope he gets it right.< /Review>< Date>

They said it was being cut.  Freshest pizza I’ve ever had.   There ranch at this location is the best I’ve ever had.   Pizza was cooked perfectly.   Restaurant is super clean.   The patio is super nice.  I will be back with my family next time I’m in area.</review><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

<Response>{'time': 1614357756974, 'text': 'Michael, thanks for sharing such a wonderful review! We’re happy to be worthy of 5 ⭐'}< /Response><Review>As of October 2020, there is new ownership. Round Table as a California brand is pretty legendary, and I still love the pizza I grew up with. But as soon as I walked in, the new owners greeted me which had never happened before, and they also took note that I was a curbside pickup, which the team that used to own had constantly ignored or screwed up. The new owners are making fresh and tasty and basically never frozen anything, and if you ever had an experience with this location in the past, it's time to give them a new chance. Also, a kind note to the owners to reach out to Google and Yelp to see if reviews earlier than October 2020 could be removed, which they will do when a new owner buys a business. The difference now is still a really great product, but it's run by people that get they're in hospitality and service, versus people that just think they're running a pizza shop. Also, this is a small business, not some huge corporation. So support it!< /Review><Time>1614308222922< /Time><name>Michael Hraba< /name></record></dataset><record>

<review>I ordered my personal pizza ahead of time for curbside pick up. I had showed up early and waited out-front. When the time of estimated delivery had arrived I simply waited (no problem at first). The thing is, I had waited a good 15mins before I decided to call, I spoke with one of the employees who was helpful but then told me my pizza would be out "right now". So I waited another 5mins, at this point I felt that this was no longer "right now". I went into the store and spoke to another employee who asked me about all my order information once more. I saw my pizza sitting on the counter under a pile of others pizzas and realized I would have sat in my car forever if I had not bothered coming inside. The pizza had definitely been sitting their for some time when I finally ate it. This whole experience just felt silly and unnecessary. Why bother ordering ahead when I would have spent the same amount of time waiting at the store if I had just walked in and placed a order then?< /review>< UserId.>

<Date>1564247020160< /Date><rate>5</rate><Review>This was one of the best experiences I have had in a long time at a pizza place.  I ordered for delivery on Thursday night and was greeted by a nice young man  Andy.  He was particularly helpful and guided me through my ordering.  I was told that my order would arrive within an hour, despite it being right in the middle of the dinner rush.  As one can imagine, I was not expecting that to actually happen at all.  To my pure amazement however, my order arrived 15 minutes earlier than quoted. The deliver driver, Mike had one of the most contagious positive attitudes I have ever seen with his "Amazing" day he was having.  This has been  5 star experience and I would recommend this place for delivery any day of the week!< /Review>< pics>

<gmapID>0x808597432ffe2a93:0x8fce2aafba1a7cc9< /gmapID><Review>Zero Stars: The very worst pizza/pizza delivery experience ever.  Round Table 4th st. San Rafael. Ordered at 4:02 PM and received an email saying delivery would be made at 5:02:14. Lol yea ah No. had to call at 5:19 to find out where the pizza was. Told 5 - 10 Min.

Well very much like the really bad Digiorno commercial where the drivers getting airborne and the pizza flying all over the interior of the car.  Well it’s a thing and that was precisely what happened. The really young driver didn’t have a heat bag to keep the pizza hot, not that it mattered.   No peppers or cheese. Got the pizza into the kitchen and boom. The Large Pizza was completely smashed into the corner of the box and destroyed.

The Manager Dennis offered to redeliver the order. That was rather comical considering the first attempt.  Requested a refund and that to has not happened.

Warning: If you want pizza and delivery go to any Pizza joint as long as it isn’t Round Table, 4th St. San Rafael.

However the night was not a total loss. Dominos on Woodland in San Rafael, had a pizza at the house 20 min later, in a heat bag, with all cheese and peppers.  Wow plates and utensils didn’t ask but nice touch. Piping hot Pizza, had to wait for it to cool down. In perfect shape. Ty DOMINOS

Well update time. Dennis stated it would take 5 to 7 days for a refund. The 4 th of May to current. Still no refund on this awful experience.

I thank the stores owner for the insincere very weak effort at figuring this out with there Manager Dennis and simply refund it as promised.  Will keep everyone updated. I hope this will put a little pause before you click order for this store.< /Review>< Time>

Placed a take out order for 3 pizzas. 2 XL pepperoni and one large 1/2 chicken, 1/2 Canadian bacon mushroom. Extra ranch dressing on the side. I had someone else pick up.
Had to repeat my order at least 6 times to Jake. He sounded pretty stoned. Had him repeat it back to me three times before he finally got it right! Then the credit card number 3 times.
Pizzas got here with no ranch or napkins! Guy who picked them up said Jake was “on something”!
The pizza was good but keep him away from the phone!! Wow!< /Review>

<Review>The pizzas were really good and yum, but what really stole the show were the garlic bread Twisties. They were so much bigger than we expected, and oh so soft . They were absolutely delicious. Loved that this place has such a variety of sizes, including a personal size. Sometimes you want a pizza but like not a complete pizza you know ?< /Review><Response>{'time': 1580940143021, 'text': "Thanks for sharing your feedback!

It's a chain, so not on par with Creekside Pizza, but for a chain their pizza's are tasty and the staff is friendly and helpful.

Be sure to ask for coupons, as the retail price for their pizza's is too high for the quality.</Text>

I was broke down on the side of the road in my 18 wheeler, near San Rafael,  and was starving for some dinner. I had a 3 hour wait till the service truck showed up so I decided to call around to see if I could find someone who would deliver to me. After calling Pizza Hut and Dominoes I was denied delivery because of my location. I found Round Table in the area and called them up and they were more than happy to feed me. These are a great group of guys I dealt with and am very thankful for them. Not only was the service outstanding but the pizza is WAY better than Pizza Hut and Dominoes. Thanks again guys!< /review>

Only one pizza was ready at the beginning of their 11:30 to 1:30 weekday all you can eat lunch. Brought out two pizzas the whole time I was there, which was about half an hour, and did not bring out any breadsticks or dessert Pizza as shown on their poster until after I was done eating. According to the counter host, they don't start bring me out pizza until people arrive. Clearly that does not work well. For over $12 including a soda, it was very very lame and I am completely disappointed with this franchise location. stars for tasty pizza and a decent salad bar. 0 Stars for not having their act together after months of being open. I won't be back - Mountain Mike's just a block down the road is a far better choice for lunch time selection and service and easier on the wallet.<//text>

<Time>1504634217629<//Time><Rating>4<//Rating><review>Was completely empty around 430pm when me and some family went. Pizza was good, didnt get anything crazy. I gave it 4 stars for the fact that it had a nice outdoor area and kids toys avaliable, the toys were a bit dirty but that was to be expected, I still let my daughter play with the little kids house, plastic saw hourse and toy tractor to name a few, so that was cool. I knocked a star off, and honestly would habe knocked off two if the outdoor area wasnt such a plus, for dirty bathrooms, didnt use them myself but a family member told me they were pretty bad, and washing hands after the toys is a must. Overall good experience.

PROS: Pizza! And beer. (Whrn are those not pros?)
Outdoor area with kids toys!
Calm (mostly empty) atmosphere late-mid day.

CONS: dirty bathrooms,
Service was minimal but not to the point of being annoying.<//review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

(Translated by Google) Hello, my experience was very bad, the employees do not wear a mask or gloves and they took a long time with the order and I asked the manager and he answered me reluctantly, it is a very good way but train the employees more

Hola mi experiencia fue muy mala los empleados no usan mascarilla ni guantes y se tardaron mucho con la orden y le pregunté al encargado y me contestó de mala gana es muy buena camida  pero entrenen más a los empleados<//Text>

<text>As long as they retain their current manager, I will not be eating at or ordering from here.
This is a regular favorite for me and I recently placed a to go order where I requested their corn tortillas (as I mentioned previously, the handmade tortillas here are a highlight). When I arrived, I found they had substituted in cheap, store bought tortillas on my tacos. Previously my waiters had only ever mentioned that the restaurant had 2 types of tortillas (flour and handmade corn), so I was confused, and asked why this had occurred. Apparently their new policy (which is written nowhere), is that you need to include the word "Handmade" with the request for "Corn tortillas" in the ordering instructions box. I asked what I would need to pay I would need to pay to have the order switched over to the handmade tortillas (this was really the only reason I had chosen to order from here). The manager (a large woman with an Eastern Bloc accent) refused to remake my order or told me they'd need to recharge me for the entire order (including the cost of the appetizers and sides). She insisted I could purchase handmade corn tortillas and just "flip" the contents of the taco over myself at home. Sounds fine, but 1. I don't want to assemble tacos at home. That's why I'm ordering takeout. 2. I ended up having to do this and the tacos were super dry because none of the sauce is retained when you "flip" them, and 3. How hard is it to just "flip" the tacos yourself for a customer and add a little more sauce? After much back and forth with this extremely rude and condescending woman, she eventually gave me some tortillas, and I was left with dry tacos that needed to be assembled at home (as mentioned above).
Note to Owner: It would be much easier to revise your online menu to allow customers to select tortilla options than to berate your loyal customers in order to enforce unannounced policy changes.
I've been a regular here since they opened and have recommended it to a ton of friends. The food is great. But after this experience, I will not be back. I can't imagine how awful this woman would be if you had a food allergy.
We have a lot of choices in which restaurants to support in coming out of this pandemic. This will not be one of them.<//text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

Staff seemed short handed tonight, but they were very friendly and accommodating; might have been busier than expected on a Wednesday night(?) because there was a good crowd there. Food was excellent.< /text>

<Text>We recently visited and were immediately impressed, despite the COVID restrictions. The food was super FRESH and FLAVORFUL. While waiting for our meals we were served chips and salsa, both of which were homemade. The salsa had a slight kick to it, and the chips were light with the perfect crunch. We had the pescado (mahi mahi), carne asada and salmon tacos - all of them were delicious! We particularly liked the fresh slaw and veggies added to the tacos, along with the tasty cilantro rice and beans served on the side. We can't wait to return! Looking forward to testing out the margarita menu next time!<//Text>< UserId.>

Leo made our experience just horrid before we even could get a table.  He just walked away while we were politely asking a question.  Hard to imagine how they can afford to deter customers that easily. Good luck to them.< /text>

This was my first time at Prima and I will not be back. The service with Leo was terrible; he rushed us, refused to split the check, and ended the meal by saying ‘I hope you don’t come back’ after my friend and I said we didn’t understand why we had to leave a half empty back patio. This was without a doubt the worst dining experience I’ve had in Santa Monica.<//text>

Prima is the best local Mexican restaurant in town. Take my word for it! Great tacos, great margs and even better prices. The street corn appetizer is absolutely amazing. My family loves it here!<//Text>

<review>Honestly some of the very best and highest level gourmet Mexican food ever! The Roasted Branzino served with 3 homemade salsas and handmade tortillas was out of this world. Was able to sample much of the menu...and could not have been more impressed. (and I"m not easy to impress!!) The thought that I can order take-out as well is dangerous!!!! Amazing food.<//review><Gmap_id>0x80c2a5c0866f7a73:0x9b50c03d93eb9133</Gmap_id>< pictures>

<Text>OK..I'm looking at the menu and I'm thinking.." at these prices, this place needs to hit a major home run. chips come to table...like they were out of a grocery bag..very common. salsa...nothing special. service good, not many people there.

ordered a pomegranate margarita for a million bucks...comes  doesn't taste like pomegranate at all...sent back. drinks come with a ton of ice, a no no for expensive drinks. food comes, asked if they had black beans...no, just pinto..? but i must say presentation and food were excellent

buy 3 enchilada plate for 24 dollars...are we in Paris....Tokyo i mean at most most it should be 16--17

so overall i wouldn't come back cause the bill came to like 80 something and i was given like a 40,00-50 dollar experience. i say to owner which I'm told owns spumoni ...get your experience up to your price points...its definitely not there yet. The Montana crowd will pay crazy money but make the whole experience a fantastic one. i feel like your trying to go 70% there and get away with something..laughing all the way to your nightly bank deposits

food is a 5 but all the little things that make the rest of the deal compensatory with the price isn't there. get on it right away or you wont be on Montana for long.<//Text><pics>None<//pics><username>mr scenester</username><gmap_id>0x80c2a5c0866f7a73:0x9b50c03d93eb9133</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Review>So sooo good! I just ordered the fabulous Carnitas Shrimp tacos with a side of rice and beans and it’s absolutely amazing. Carnitas is juicy and not greasy at all. Flour tacos are bomb and the red salsa makes it all. Highly recommend trying both tacos. They are also doing 50% OFF ALL ORDERS at this time so that helped!!<//Review><userid>106015430160393983694</userid></record>

I went there the other evening and since we were a party of two they would not seat us at their only available table which was a table for 4. It would not usually bother me, but they only had one table for two in the entire restaurant. There was no one waiting for a table. Rude to customers. Recommend finding a restaurant that is respectful to customers and not so arrogant.</review>

My wife and I went to have dinner last night here. There was a couple of tables that were available and no one waiting. The person who greeted us was rude to us. The service was horrible and I was disappointed. I had been there previously with my siblings and thought the service was good. The same person was very condescending to us. Ignored us and actually took an order from someone else who sat down after us. My wife said she would like water and he was pushing her to get another drink such as soda or Mexican Soda (Fresca). The food was good. But felt very unwelcome a better place to patronize is Socalo.<//review>

<review>A great local standby that never disappoints.   The fish dishes are incredible.
I had the branzino which was grilled to perfection and the shrimp fajitas are highest quality shrimp served with hand made tortillas.  The usual dishes like quesadillas are the best on the west side.   All the ingredients are fresh and homemade and healthy.  The best guacamole this side of the border.   Margaritas are fantastic and so reasonable.    The owner and servers are so friendly and accommodating.</review><user_id>113169622016180762487< /user_id>< Date>

Wanted to like this place, but they charged me more than was on their site, the food wasn't good at all and the chips tasted like they came out of a grocery store bought bag. Didnt taste fresh.<//Review>

<Text>Orders were all wrong, they didnt give us our sides of rice and beans that were supposed to come with the order. They gave everyone around us chips and salsa but us. They didn’t fill or ask if we needed refills. Worst service ever, we were dressed a little casual but even then, all guest should be treated with the same and given the same experience. First time I’ve never tipped!< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

The foods was tasteless, oily, burned and the unfriendly staff decided to sweep the floor ( in the small area) where we were sitting during our meal.  Conpletely insane, unprofessional and the worse mexican we ever had.< /Text>

<text>I always judge a bar on the cleanliness of their bathroom. Joe's Bar has one of the cleanest bars in downtown Chico. It is always stocked with the essentials. The owner is super nice. The bartenders are great at what they do. I will definitely be returning.<//text>< pictures>

Joe's used to be the only bar I went to. Good place to grab drinks. Lately it's been pretty packed when I go, usually filled with the true country folk. If you get there early enough you can get a table on busy nights. Takes a couple minutes to get to the bathroom when its busy.
Excellent place to drink and hang out when its slower though.</review>

Have yet been able to order a drink here. Too crowded! Only go with friends and end up chatting in the back where you can barely hear each other.

Great place if you like rubbing up against strangers and praying you don't get punched for grinding on some dude's girl or spilling his drink.<//review>

I love the day crowd. Night crowd is too rowdy for me. Sweet bartenders & humble vibe. Super inexpensive. Look for the word of the day.</review>

As a small business owner, reliability and being punctual is a rare but precious quality that we seek in vendors and technicians.  Needless to say, this year was extremely difficult for small business owners.  So when LA County finally allowed our operations to resume we had very short turnaround time.  This is when we discovered that our Boiler wasn't functioning properly.  I called multiple vendors and specialists, but decided to go with Jason from A O Dowd Plumbing because of the way he went about asking me what the issue and problems I was experiencing in trying to diagnose the situation over the phone.  Most other competitors were more interested in making sure you know their rates and how this is considered overtime.  As a business owner, I am as skeptical and jaded as they come unfortunately due to the numerous times of let downs, price gauging, and simply dealing with "call centers" than actual technicians.  So I took a chance with Jason.  Although he had other jobs prior to ours; he understood the urgency of our situation and sympathetic to the fact that we're just a small business barely trying to hang on while LA County wreck havoc with abrupt opening/closing policies.  He scheduled our job for the early evening since he knew we needed our boiler to be fixed in order to get opened.  He did a great job communicating when he was about to head over outside of LA County and the time frame to expect him.  Upon arrival, he diagnosed the situation and presented the potential solutions along with the price quote.  I highly recommend Jason because not only was he very professional but he was very transparent in how he was going to present potential solutions in tackling the problem.  He did wonders in getting our very old but still solid boiler up and running in a couple hours.  He definitely saved the day for us.</Text>

Needed repair of water heater. Call Dowd Plumping. Call returned right away. Professional service and great communication. Jason was great , very friendly and trustworthy. Searched for parts to repair my water heater, however it was outdated. Unit was replaced with new upgraded model in a timely manner and fair price. Would highly recommend and will only be using this company in the future!< /Review>

<review>I had some issues with my boiler and their website was very clear on their expertise in that boiler so I called right away. They were were a little outside my area so Jason spent 15-20 minutes over the phone walking me though how to diagnose and fix it myself. I was able to get it up and running. I’m impressed with his knowledge of the boiler and personal skills to communicate everything very well, not to mention going out of his way just to help. Very personable and easy to work with. Highly recommend.</review><Gmap_id>0x80c34d37ea624413:0x6c6173aa666efad1< /Gmap_id></record>

<review>I would like to recommend A O DOWD to everybody that reads this review.
I moved to this area two years ago, and it was my first time calling a plumber, being very careful , I had four companies come and gave me quotes on descale my tankless water heater, and a whole house water filter system. Out of the four plumbers I met, Jason stand out.
First, he is quick to response and on time. Second, he is very professional, and very patient to explain everything that needs to be done. So after the first appointment, I can almost envision what needs to be done. Third and the most important thing is that I have a great deal. I have a tight budget, and Jason is so kind to provide the service and meet me on my budget. Forth, the service is excellent, I would give a ten star if it is available. Jason installed the whole house water filter system the next day I approve the proposal. He did a great job,  very detail oriented. He even walked extra miles to fix the cracks on the wall around the pipes just to make me a happy customer!

There are many experienced plumbers, but not everyone is patient with you; there are also many plumbers that can fix your problems, but not everyone has a heart to bring a big smile on your face by walking an extra mile like Jason!< /review>< Pictures>

He got to work and gave us an estimate. We decided to go with A O Dowd Plumbing because of fair pricing and also because of Hectors knowledge and politeness. They got the job done right and at a fair price. I’m definitely recommending them to my family and friends. Great job guys! I’m definitely a customer for life.< /text>

<review>Jason and his guy saved the day again! We woke up this morning with water leaking from our tankless water heater. We had no idea what was going on and we both had to go to work. Jason showed up in the morning and diagnosed the issue immediately. Turns out we had a faulty water heater and he took care of everything regarding the warranty. We didn’t have to lift a finger or do a thing! Talk about customer service! He called the company that makes the water heater and gave them all he info and got us a brand new one the same day! He waited around the neighborhood until we got off work to install it after we got off work just because he didn’t want it to continue to leak. Call Jason. He is also super friendly and professional. Nice to know good guys are still around!<//review><response>None</response><Pics>None<//Pics>< gmapID>

I called and spoke to Jose about a water heater failure as well as a shower/bath leak. He was helpful on the telephone and was able to visit the same day.  He quickly diagnosed both issues and fixed them both.
The cost was reasonable and well worth the attention and remedy.  I will use them for any future needs and certainly suggest them to others.  Thank you very much.<//Text>

Very happy with my experience with A O Dowd plumbing, my family and I were having issues with our plumbing and needed it fixed asap. Be that as it may it was very late in the day and we were expecting rain. Jason and his associate came by and fixed the issue in great time, he was very informative and friendly. I can honestly say that I was stress free as soon as he arrived and will be definetly going to Jason again with any plumbing needs.</Text>

Wasted my time and money replacing something that was not the caused of the leak. Found A O Dowd Plumbing on the internet and emailed Jason. He came out the next morning to take a look. Gave me an honest assessments of the issues and the solution. Keep replacing parts until something else goes wrong or get a new water heater and not worry about it for a long time. Negotiated with me on the new water heater and installation. We came to a happy agreement and he went right to work. The job was done professionally and left everything nice and clean.

I bought a bank foreclosure in North Fontana and I needed a plumber quickly for escrow to close. I was referred by a realtor to Jason O Dowd Plumbing. I called Jason and he told me he could fix my plumbing problem the next day. The water faucet in the bath tub was torn off. Jason had to open the wall on the bedroom on the opposite side of the fiberglass shower. He knew exactly what to do. He had to soder the new pipes together and install the new faucet. He did and amazing job. So I asked him to install all brand new bathroom fixtures in the bathroom. Jason was very quick and knowledgeable. I trust his work and will call him for any future plumbing problems that I have. I highly recommend his plumbing company!< /review>

I had a sudden plumbing back up problem and I called a few places and nobody was available. I called this phone number and they answered right away and someone happened to be just a few minutes away from my house and they were at my house  working on my mess within the hour. They fixed everything immediately. Jose was awesome. Young kid, awesome personality. Did his job  with a great attitude And taught me a few things along the way. They did everything in time for me to go to work. Thanks guys< /text>

I came home to 2 flooded bathrooms and discovered that water was leaking from up under my toilet. I knew it must be clogged so I started searching online for a plumber. Came across A O Dowd and found they had great reviews and called them. Jason contacted me and after telling him what the problem was he said he would be over as soon as he finished the job he was on. In no time Jason was at my place and knew exactly what the problem was as soon as he walked up. He took care of it very quickly and at a very affordable price and I would highly recommend them to anyone! Thanks Jason, great job!<//Text>

<review>Such a great job from A O Dowd Plumbing!!
My grandma needed a new ADA height toilet for my handicapped grandpa. Jason came out and installed a great new toilet and even took the time to install a grab bar to make it safer for my grandpa to get up and down out of the seat.
A O Dowd Plumbing did not take advantage of my grandparents and treated them with respect! Such a great experience:-) Our whole family will use A O Dowd Plumbing for all our plumbing needs!< /review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>{'time': 1541599567200, 'text': 'We are happy to be able to help!'}</resp>< gmap_id>

<text>Jason is awesome very reasonable in price, dependable! Jason redid my bathroom and he was very good and completed the task in the time he said he would. Another time I needed Jason after he completed my bathroom he said he would be there later that day cuz he was on a job I Panicked cuz a knob broke on my backyard  faucet busted so I called someone else out and for what they had to do the price was ridiculous, so I had to come myself down and wait for Jason he was there soon as he completed his job and took care of the problem way less than what that other company quoted. Keep up the good work Jason Dowd</text>< gmapID>

I found A O Dowd Plumbing on the internet because I was in desperate need of a plumber. My kitchen ceiling was leaking, I was very apprehensive about letting someone drill a hole in the ceiling. However, Jason assured me he has been in the plumbing business for over 15 years and can do the work. He diagnosed the problem. He informed my husband and I the leak was coming from the toilet in our master bedroom bathroom located upstairs. Jason replaced the faulty pipe, as well as having one of his staff, by the name of Orlando to repair the hole in my ceiling back to new. Jason and his staff remained professional and helpful. I highly recommend them and now have a trustworthy plumber.< /text>

Little hole in the wall that served us great boba for even better prices. If you don’t feel like spending $16 at the gentrified trendy places I would recommend this. The service has been nice although maybe a little understaffed. I’m excited to try their food!< /review>

My go-to spot for honey lemon tea or Thai milk tea. They brew with real tea leaves and ingredients. The bossman here puts in a great deal of care and quality in the making of the drinks. Come through and support this local shop!< /text>

Sooooo good! My family stopped in while waiting for our Chinese take out across the street.  We decide to try this place since we love tapioca drinks. We ordered a Taro slush and Lychee green tea which were delicious!!!My husband said it was the best Taro slush he's had as of yet. The popping topping for the drinks are fun and yummy and the service is wonderful! I wish I had known about this place sooner. We found our neighborhood go to spot.<//review>

My go to favorite San Bruno Avenue tea house was unexpectedly closed 😱 so I decided to try a neighboring tea house Tea Plus! Firstly, their happy hour special is a few cents cheaper than my fav place which was a instant plus in these penny pinching pandemic times! I ordered a Passion Fruit Slushy with a combination of passion fruit jellies and bobas and while not as photogenic as my favorite drink it was absolutely delish, I was munching on jellies and bobas for awhile after the drink was finished so it's safe to say the ordering of the extra combo probably was overkill. The one truly wonderful part of my visit to Tea Plus was the customer service. The older gentleman that was supervising a younger worker took over as I think my add-ons were a bit complicated to the check out app they used and he was friendly and knowledgeable and made me feel very welcome I felt that my drink choice was in truly good hands. Customer service is a rarity around SF at most times so when it is provided I'm always apppreciative! The cons would be that the ambiance is lacking and the drinks again aren't very photogenic but the pros heavily outweigh these small cons. Five star customer service and a yummy in my tummy afternoon drink! Thank you Tea Plus I will be visiting again for sure and now I have two very favorite San Bruno Avenue Tea Houses for my special treats! I think next time I'll be trying the crepes as well or maybe even the spam hand roll! *** Major plus I didn't pay an upcharge for my jelly boba combos!< /review>

Service was fast and pleasant, but the black milk tea is definitely made with earl grey and strongly tasted like bergamot. There wasn’t enough boba to last the entire drink. There’s not really a reason to go here when there’s many other tapioca places on the same street.</text>

<Rating>2</Rating><review>I've been to Tea Plus 3 times so far.
I usually go to 5° a couple doors down.  Tea Plus's special price is a bit cheaper & they are now offering a discount for students with a student ID therefore most of the customers are teenagers.
They seem to have slow service even when they aren't busy.
1st times when they first opened, their bubbles were too hard, chewy & the tea was not strong enough & a bit too sweet.  2nd time, about 1 month ago the bubbles were better.  3rd time, the lychee popping bubbles were wrinkly.  I tried to order other food items couple of times but it seems like they are always out or it won't be ready for some time so I've never ordered food from them.  Also, the store is smaller & have less seating compared to 5°.  The guy who works there who I think is the owner looks like he just woke up.  His hair is always a mess & he looks exhausted.
He looks like he needs a haircut, shower & some good sleep.</review>< Pics>

The decor is brightly done up and decidedlt cheerful, however the speed of the food coming out does seem to take a while to come out, not the staff's fault but they could probably do with having an extra staff during the lunch and afterwork period.
Owner claimed to have the best Curry Fishballs in SF or our money back, so decided to try them, however the portion size is small for the price of around 4 bucks and while decent, hardly spectacular as per the claims.</Text>< Pictures>

<date>1495041815266<//date><text>One blustery evening, my boo and I were exploring the streets of San Francisco. It was super late and many eateries were closing, but one little place caught our eye. Never having been there before, we decided to pop in to Tea Plus for a quick refreshing bubbly drink. They had a really extensive menu and many available toppings as well as customized ice and sweetness preferences. I ordered the chocolate coconut milk Boba drink. The drink was sweeter than pie and creamier than hell. The tapioca Boba added a nice chewy, starchy bite that hit the spot just right. Although the taste was lit AF and quenched a thirst deep within, the service was a bit odd and we had to wait around 20 minutes for a drink. We asked the server how he was doing and he responded with a phrase including a few casual obscenities, which I personally didn't mind but a straight laced professional might to take offense to such lingo. But due to the drink quality and taste, we returned twice and got the Oreo Milk Tea with Boba tapioca. Honestly best drink I've ever had, hunty. Go for the taste, service is a crapshoot and you might have to wait but boo it's worth it! SLAY QUEENS honestly you slay my LIFE</text><pictures>None</pictures><rate>4< /rate>< Name>

<rating>4</rating><Text>The sandwich shop was empty, very clean. The young lady behind the counter was polite and charming and, in the end, understanding. My friend gave me a gift card she had won, so I went to the sandwich shop to treat myself to a toasted sub combo. I tried to pay with my card, failed. The lady behind the counter stated that I wasn't registered, so I sat down with the task of registering the card, after what seemed like eternity I managed to register the card, finally the nightmare ended, so I thought. The card failed twice more. Now hungry and irritated, I tried for another 30 me ns that's lost to me forever, only to come to the conclusion, there was never any money on the card. Embarrassed, I fled the restaurant mortified that the nice young lady had prepared a great looking sandwich for nothing. All I can say is getting a gift card, and getting a gift card that's loaded, are two very different scenarios.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

<Review>Keep an eye on them, they do not like to honor national promos, even the ones they advertise in store. More than once they tried to charge me regular pricing on sandwich and drink promos, then I had to correct them. Not an accident. Not worth the trouble</Review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

Always quick, this store is particularly well run.

Parking can be rough, I suggest using the small lot west of the store to avoid the nail salon & Walgreens traffic.<//review>

There was only one person working in the whole place, I walked in and waited in line for 20min while she only helped 1 person and was started to help her second. She made sandwiches, then touched money, then went back to sandwiches. Don’t waste your time, go buy your own stuff to make sandwiches, eat fresh my butt.</Review>

The owner is abrupt and borderline rude, they don't run the corporate specials other stores do. If the owner makes your sandwich she will be very chintzy with the veggies so tell her to add more.<//text>

Worst place we've ever ordered from!!!!Stopped by at 3:15 for a light and easy family meal.ordered 3 toasted footlongs We live 1 mile away. When we set up for everyone to eat we opened disgusting oil & vinager drenched soggy sandwiches, needless to say they were unfit for consumption. Ordered sweet onion teriyaki and bmt. I called to see if they could help correct the order and all I got was a" sorry"( oh and no sweet onion sauce what so ever!!!) All the lady could say was some people don't like the sauce!!! Who would bother to order a SWEET ONION TERIYAKI AND NOT WANT SAUCE BUT INSTEAD THEY DRENCH IT IN OIL AND VINAGER????<//review>

Dr. Ehlers and Bibi are an amazing medical duo. Knowledge, kindness, a sense of humor  and a way with patients, that is what makes us appreciate SD Internal Medicine so much.
Matthew and I love you and your wonderful staff.
Thank you for everything you do.....</text>

I highly recommend San Diego Internal Medicine. Dr Upton is a wonderful pediatrician,  and we were so pleased with my son’s care, both my husband and myself became patients. He’s fantastic! We’ve been seeing him for 10 years now. He always listens to our concerns, and eager to answer questions. The staff is great and friendly. Always do their best to get us in quickly with unexpected appts, and when we’ve not been able to see Dr Upton, Jennifer Lyons has also provided the same caring and informative approach. Could not recommend them enough!</Review>

<Text>This is an excellent practice. Kind knowledgeable staff from the front desk to the MA’s and the physician.  Dr Williams-Wayne is thorough and conducts one’s examination in a none rushed manner allowing plenty of time to discuss concerns. The premises are very clean and sanitary. I will recommend this practice to friends and family.<//Text>< pictures>

Dr. Upton is the Doctor to see!
He is so knowledgeable and caring. He is my primary physician, but I have not seen him for 6+ years. Whenever I had some sort of an urgent matter (or not), I saw nurse practitioners. With a recent urgent matter, I asked to see Dr. Upton and will not go back. Thank you, Dr. Upton!<//text>

Dr. Ehlers and Bebe his nurse give us the greatest care. With Follow My Health we can message them and hear back quickly. It is wonderful to receive such personalized care where we are not a medical record number but we are known by our names. Before Covid hugs were freely given as they are truly our caregivers. Dr. E is the best diagnostician you will ever find and is a brilliant doctor.</Text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><text>Dr. UPTON is the FIRST doctor I've had as a primary since coming to San Diego in 1988 who actually listens, explains, and communicates with excellence.

His staff communicates well, too, but i really value how easily accessible Dr. UPTON HIMSELF Is through Follow My Health email.

I highly recommend Dr. UPTON!!!!!  As a senior citizen who has had some degree of trauma during the Pandemic, I have the utmost confidence and gratitude that Dr. UPTON  is my primary and he has been an amazing support during this difficult time.

Thank you Dr. UPTON and staff!</text><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None< /Resp><GmapID>0x80dbffda3d52b87f:0xe4d47b4cacd87c39</GmapID></record>

I have been a patient of San Diego Internal Medicine Associates for over 15 years and I have nothing but great things to say about this place. Dr. Upton has always been there for me and my family even when he’s extremely busy. He dedicates the time to listen and makes you feel like you matter. We are incredibly grateful with this practice.< /Text>

<text>We absolutely love Dr. Upton‘s office. The children always feel at ease there, and we feel heard. If we had one complaint it would have to be the phone system. It takes a considerably long time for anyone to answer the line. When someone finally does answer,  it is not always a pleasant experience.. This is not something that just started happening after the pandemic hit. It has been around since the beginning of our start with San Diego Internal Medicine group. Again, we love Dr. Upton and his staff, but we suggest looking into a new phone service.< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

Staff members were welcoming, friendly and very efficient! I felt well taken care of and didn’t have to waste anytime sitting around. The doctors and nurses were cheerful and knowledgeable, and accommodating as I had to bring my young toddler... The receptionist even gave him an Elmo sticker which helped to keep him occupied! Thanks for a great visit.</text>

Dr. Upton, Jennifer, and all at the front and back staff are beyond attentive, professional, and reliable.  My wife and I have been their patient for over 8 years.  In that time my numerous health risks were managed and I'm still here healthier than ever.  We are lucky to have them in our corner.</text>

Dr Upton and Jenn Lyons are by far the B.E.S.T! They listen to you, never feel as if I'm being rushed in any shape or form. They are such a good team! I don't mind going to the Dr when I get to see one of these two.
Thanks so much for all you do Dr Upton and of course MY Jenn Lyons!<//Review>

From the staff to the Nurses, and PA'S everyone have treated me with the utmost care and professionalism.  Doctor Roth is the best! He is caring, listens to what I have to say, and treats me with the utmost professionalism.   I would recommend SDIMA to anyone.</Text>

Jennifer Obana is excellent!! You never have to wait more than 5 min to get called in and she’s in 5 min later . She’s very thorough and listens to your needs she gets straight to the issue and helps figure out the best outcome I have never ever felt rushed and I’ve been seeing her for about 2 years. So has my husband and he feels the same .Great office great doctors I wouldn’t go anywhere else.</Text>

Dr. Upton is the best. He is compassionate, patient, and caring. He is the best Dr I've ever had. He always takes extra time with me and always was so nice and patient with my husband. We are lucky to have him as our Dr. And his staff is also very nice and professional as well!</review>

I have been coming here for over 5 years. I can't tell you how many times I needed to be seen right away for different medical reasons. If they cannot get me in the same day, it's usually within 1 or 2 days maximum. I am grateful for all the medical assistants, physician assistants and doctors and staff! Just today, I needed a Covid-19 test to get cleared for an upcoming event. I was able to be seen by a doctor within 30 minutes of calling and got tested shortly after.  They always have referrals for outside specialists when needed to. This place has been super for me.</Text>

My family and I have been going to San Diego Internal Medicine Associates & Pediatrics for over 20 years now. They are always so pleasant and welcoming. My primary care physician, Dr. Ehlers, is the best.  He is always so thorough and explains everything.  I trust him completely. His PA (Debbie Frogozo) knows me and my sister on sight. I feel like she knows everything about us. I can't say enough good things about them. I tell everyone I know about about the wonderful care they provide me and can't recommend them enough.</Text>

When you schedule an appointment in this office, that is the actual time you are seen. The staff is very quick, but also keeping it individual and respectful. The last thing I am always asked is, “is there anything else you are concerned about that we didn’t touch on.” Very professional and very through and make me feel well cared for always. Thank you Dr Ehlers and staff.</review>

He spends as much time as necessary during an exam, calls back promptly with test results, and sends you to a Specialists if need be. He was my husbands doctor during a long chronic illness and I always knew we could not have been in Greater hands. I will always feel grateful for that time and his genuine brilliant care.  thank you Dr Monsour for  all of the years I sincerely appreciate you.</Review>< Name>

Grateful for the excellent care we (our whole family) receive from the brilliant and wonderful Dr Rolf Ehlers at San Diego Internal Medicine Group! Been seeing him for years. Dr Ehlers is caring, responsive, and addresses the issues thoroughly and with great insight. He’s funny too. As our kids grew out of pediatrics I was so happy to bring them on board with Dr Ehlers as well. The practice is well managed and you can reach helpful humans by phone, whether to set up an appointment or ask a question. Bebe is a treasure too, always helpful and pleasant.< /text>

<review>I called my doctor at SDIMA for a phone-consult on Monday 5/17.  Since I’d had a HIGH-fever all weekend, my first priority was to get tested for covid-19.  My Dr. Ehlers of almost 20yrs was out so they quickly arranged for me to see Dr. Linda Huynh and was given a covid19 swab test that same day.  It was negative, so so she ordered tests for pneumonia & influenza (P&I) and got a blood test as well ASAP to see if any other infection was present.

She was cautious because I’m 79 and I’d had fevers of 103.6 and 104.3, and she wanted to know WHY and HOW it happened to me when it did.  The results won’t be in until the next week of Monday, 5/24.

But most important:    All the doctors work as a team, and with their fast team-response and care, I know that all that can be done is being done.

My situation is complex, but I still am getting what what I need when I need it.  A grateful thanks to Dr. Huynh and everyone at SDIMA< /review>< username>

The team at SDIMA are nothing short of a miracle in action. Dr. Ehlers and crew are deeply caring and competent professionals. They have that “it” factor that takes an experience from good to great, and then to truly exceptional.</Review>

<text>I have been a patient of Dr. Rolf Ehlers, for over 25+ years now. I also see his PA Debbie Frogozo  as well.

I have always been happy and satisfied with the care I have received from San Diego internal medicine. They are very thorough in their exams, there is not a long wait time between appointments, they refer you out to specialists if anything is of concern, and spend time listening to your problems and documenting everything.

I recently had some significant health issues being treated by a G.I. specialist but Dr. Ehlers, and Debbie were always informed and on top of my care throughout the process.

I would not hesitate to refer them to any friends or family of mine.< /text>< Pics>

I always look forward to see him for my annual exam and check-up.  The staff and his nurse at his office are truly exemplary in being attentive to patients, myself included, from the time of checking in, waiting in the clean and well-ventilated waiting area, the visit of Dr. Ehler organized by his nurse, and the blood work at the end of the visit.
I have been a patient of Dr. Ehler for 20 years for a great reason.  It's a true meaning of doctor-patient relationship where total trust in my doctor is placed.  He is always thorough during the visit and addresses my overall health issues as I age... as we all do age .The information of my visit or health information is then uploaded on Follow My Health account where only my doctors and I can access, a great way of communication.

In a couple of occasions where I needed to see Dr. Ehler urgently (not emergently), he arranged with his office to see me as soon as the next day.  This is an example of a doctor who truly cares about his patients.
I can say I am receiving the best care possible in both prevention and treatments by Dr. Ehler.
In summary, I love my doctor, his nurse and his office staff at the San Diego Internal Medicine Associates.< /Review><Rate>5< /Rate><user>117025407780802743296</user></record></dataset><record>

I have found the care to be very good at the point Loma office but currently being handicapped in terms of walking distances there is a drastic shortage of parking spaces for handicapped people. They really need to redesign some of the exterior facility features to make it easier for people in wheelchairs etc. I never thought of it before but since having major heart surgery it came into my view. There is a ramp but there's no cut in the curb to get to that ramp or up to the doorit was not a lot of thought given to some of the layout here Yes it was part of the old NTC in the building so probably historical but adjustments should be made for the handicap I only see one handicap parking spot. The care is good but facility leaves me something to say is desired or I would have given it a five star

<username>Andrea N.<//username><Time>1611256527709<//Time><rate>2</rate><Review>Dr Meyer is amazing. Unfortunately the billing office is awful. I have asthma and have been in communication with the doctor monthly. Last month, when I had an acute episode that landed me in the hospital, I was allowed to make an appt, but they called me the morning of the appointment to let me know they were canceling it due to a billing issue. I was fearful of my condition and shocked that i was being denied access to care.. i was told they cant help me until i speak to billing.
I was transfered to billing and informed that my account was in collections! I was shocked that I was literally being prevented from care for a bill i didn't even know about. I spoke with billing who said there was around $300 past due. I said that I had more than met my deductible when I had surgery this year so I have no idea how this is possible. I was told to call my insurance company. I did that and they agreed that I had met my deductible and said to have their office resend everything to them. So I called them to do that and was told they won't do that because it is now in COLLECTIONS. I was shocked. I said how is it possible that a bill I didn't know about is already in collections, I call here at least once a month for an appointment. They said that there is staff turn over and not everyone is trained to look for that. I said well they sure new how to look for it when I needed him the most and now I can't get the care I need (btw, urgent cares dont treat asthma because if potential covid risk with the treatment so I was forced to the hospital and had no way to follow up with my PCP.). So they won't resend the bill to my insurance and my only recourse is to pay it. I had the money on my FSA but we had lost the card and had to wait for a new one.
I call back when I get it and let them know that I am paying this bill, but that it is under duress and I would like my concerns noted. The very rude lady named Daliah (or something that sounds like that) tells me that they sent letters. I said, I'm not saying you didn't send a letter that I missed. Im saying that if anyone had mentioned this when I called every month, I could have taken care of it before I was in crisis. Im saying that nobody attempted to call me about this bill even one time. Nobody had this bill in FollowMyHealth that I look at regularly (I also use MyChart with another doctor and both of these apps do have sections for payments and billing and I have absolutely resolved bills that way before woth other providers). I didn't receive an email that I also check regularly. There was no other good faith effort made to contact me before sending me to COLLECTIONS over a very small bill and preventing me from getting the care I needed during an acute episode of asthma (new prescriptions and equipment needed for home, new medications I had questions about, etc). She proceeds to TALK OVER ME telling me that they send letters and they aren't required to do more than that and that "that is on you" for not getting the letters once they send them, etc. I told her that speaking over me, not even listening to my concerns about their procedures is doing nothing to make me feel better as a patient or as a customer. She says "so are you making a payment today?" I said yes, I already said I would (but wanted them to consider the patient perspective here, which they absolutely did not). I gave my card number. She offered to EMAIL me that confirmation (but couldn't email the bill or a note to call about it before now??)

They were insanely rude and heartless during the entire process. I hate that I have to find a new doctor now. If I could rate Dr Meyer separately from his billing department, he would get 5 stars. He also continued to respond to my messages on FollowMyHealth even though he knew I was dealing with all of that in billing. But literally being denied access to care over a billing error, and then not even listening to my concerns about their procedures, was over the line awful :(< /Review>< Pics>

<text>I hammered Dr. ROTH with 25 questions, he went into my patient files from other Dr.'s he has sent me to and really calmed me down, I'm 61 and think I'm 40, so it's time to listen to him.  😉  how come he always tells me to lose 10 lbs... LOL</text>< pics>

I had my first visit to establish a primary care doctor. Originally I thought it had gone alright, but I am upset that there was very little patient education, if any at all. They administered medroxyprogesterone acetate (birth control) and I just came to find out it causes irreversible loss of bone mass density in young adults. It would have been a great if my doctor Linda Huynh had mentioned it. There's a variety of birth control methods and I am sure they don't all cause irreversible loss of bone mass density. If you come here, you need to advocate for yourself.<//review>

When I leave message on the phone,

<Response>None</Response><Review>I’ve been seeing Dr. Upton for a year now and I am 100% pleased with his service.  He is easy to  talk to about any concerns and is incredibly knowledgeable. His staff is great as well.  Yesterday, 2/13/20, he was running a few minutes behind for our follow up and Amanda, NP, was able to jump in and address my needs so I could be seen in a timely manner. I trust her as much as Dr. Upton and would recommend the Serra Mesa location to anyone.< /Review></record>

<review>I’ve been a patient here for about 10 years and have always just seen the physician’s assistants. They are all wonderful. But now I bring my infant daughter to see Dr. Upton and Dr. Meyers and they are so great with her. Any questions we have, they always have the answers and put us at ease (First time parents freak out about everything, right?). The nurses are all very comforting, even when giving shots to her because that’s never fun. Thank you to the whole staff for your wonderful care!< /review>< userid>

Outstanding doctors, nurses, medical staff etc. from the time you meet them, caring for your Health is important. TEAM AWESOME!< /text>

Im always happy with the level of service I get at SDIM! They literally have the best team of people working here. Rocky at the front desk is ALWAYS happy and makes me smile even when Im not feeling the greatest.  Amianne Huffman PA-C is by far my favorite healthcare provider.  She is so attentive to my needs and always makes time to see me last minute. I feel so comfortable with her, which is a big statement coming from someone who gets super nervous at Dr's appointments.  She actually listens to her patients and has already helped me so much with my chronic migraines when other doctors have dismissed me in the past.  Thank you so much for all that you do!<//Review>

San Diego Internal Medicine is one of the best places to receive top healthcare . The staff is always friendly, helpful and welcoming. The Doctors are amazing in that they take the time to listen as well as to inform. The advice they give are only in the best interest of their patients. I am fortunate to have such a knowledgeable and caring group as my primary care physicians.</Review>

Edit: I gave them one more chance after the doctor reached out to me about this. I had some blood work done at the lab next to their office and when I called about the results the doctor promptly called me back. I'm not sure if it was an issue with the office staff that answer phones or what but hopefully it's been resolved.

Its impossible to get results from them. I recently had an ultrasound done to check a few lumps in my breast and tried multiple times to get my results. I was told that they hadn't received them so after waiting 3 days (and being told by the place that did the testing that they had indeed faxed them over AND that the doctors have the ability to view the results online) I had to drive to the place that did my testing, pick the results up, and take them to the doctors office so they would stop making excuses. I ended up needing additional testing (a mammogram), its been a week now and I haven't heard anything. I've reached out many times just to be told the same thing, they haven't received the results. I'm not going to bother to go pick the results up and take them to my doctors office AGAIN. It shouldn't be the patient's responsibility to relay results for IMPORTANT tests. Luckily, I can view my results online and understand what they mean. If you might need important testing done, I wouldn't trust this office, you won't get your results without a massive hassle.<//text>

I have been a patient of Dr. Ehlers for years.  He is the best PCP I have had in San Diego.  He fulfills and exceeds the highest description of a Primary Care Physician.  His care and advise has been outstanding.  I can't say enough about my trust and confidence in Dr. Ehlers -- he's a straight shooter!</review>

Took my son in for a well-check with Jen (P.A).  I really like the P.A.s at this office (Amanda, Jen, and Ami) for my kids and for my own healthcare.  Jen took the time to chat with me about my concerns.  In addition, the nurse, P.A. student, and Jen took care of my sons check-up thoroughly and in a manner well-suited to an 8-year-old boy.  They were both professional and fun.  It was a great visit.</text>

I have waking up with headaches for the last 3 months and I have bluyry vision pain just on my left side of my forehead.

She said they're were other options so I asked what they were. She replied by saying" they're are other options." I asked what they were and she replied with the same sentence. She kept repeating herself and wouldn't let me talk! I asked her " can I speak?" And she said "no." ??? What kind of medical professional says that.  I felt like she just wanted to get me out of her office. She said the Ct scan is too much money and if I really wanted her to go to the ER and say I hit my head and they would give me one there!!??

<text>I have to say i am a Die Hard Red Mango fan,  but  coco swirl is great as well. The mochi is really good and really fresh as it is made locally everyday day. Also, I like that they have several different tart flavors. I love the mango tart. Most other places just have plain mango, which can be too sweet sometimes!
I definitely recommend this place since there is no red mango locally. BUt also coco swirl is cheaper!</text>< username>

Had an order of the Watermelon Sorbet (~$3): Non-dairy sorbet w/fruit flavor (watermelon) - topped with a little peanut. Food was delicious, staff was patient, and the ambiance was desolate.< /Review>

This place is amazing. Best boba in the area. Their ingredients are fresh, they use real milk, the people will adjust your drink to your taste, and they make their boba fresh.

Oh and their fro-yo is fantastic as well.</review>

What's the deal with having THEM get samples for you? I don't like to be treated like a criminal in a yogurt shop. There's a reason this place is completely empty on Friday night... overall a disappointment</Text>

<review>We were looking for a local Baker and decided to give Lil bear bakery a try.  Well it is in an unfortunate location, the service was excellent. They were very interested and willing to help us get the perfect cake. And boy did they deliver! The cake was beautiful and tasted great.

We've actually gone here for another set of cakes and again, great service the cakes are awesome and exactly what we ordered.</review>< pics>

<Review>Lindmair exceeded expectations. I gave very simple instructions and they delivered, which shows that he knows his business and what the customer wants. From the flavor to the design, it was exactly what I wanted. Definitely coming back. Not to mention, the owner is such a humble and nice person.</Review>< Pics>

They even added purple figs in the middle, but what really sold my family and I was their crust - very unique and just phenomenal! Will be ordering this again for future birthdays!

I highly recommend Lindmair Bakery.< /review>

Second time ordering a cake from this place! The owner and staff are so friendly and professional. Placed an order last minute and they were able to go through with it versus the other places that required a 2 week notice in advance. The cake was delicious and on top of that, the prices were amazingly affordable! Definitely coming back!<//Text>

The cake is fluffy and moist (all four layers👍👍) The Buttercream icing is not too thick nor too sweet but fluffy and perfect, as is his craftsmanship. Thank you Lindmair. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐</text>< pics>

Absolutely Amazing, Quick, Quality, Superior Knowledge, Extra Nice! It was my Parent's 50th Wedding Anniversary. When they were married, they saved the top of the cake for their 1st Anniversary, but it was Horrible. They couldn't even Eat a bite. So their "Must Have Gift" had to be the top to their cake 50 years later. My Great Grandma made the original cake. When I  gave them the Lindmair Wedding Anniversary cake they were So Excited. Imagine having to wait 50 years to finally "have their cake and eat it too!" :) It was truly the Best Gift EVER. Marble cake with chocolate mousse filling and the most beautiful and tasty butter frosting. Thank you So Much, Lindmair Bakery. You made the day. They actually cut the cake with their original cake knife from 50 years ago! So Very Blessed and Beautiful and Over the Top "WOW YUMMY"!<//text>

I love using this bakery, ever since I found them 3 years ago they are my go to option. Family owned business, father and son team, that does amazing work with icing (no fondant). Every cake I've ordered had been very creative and they have never disappointed. Not only is the cake beautiful but also delicious. Here is the Super Mario cake I ordered last week for my son's birthday. Definitely give them a try!</Review>

Love this little family owned bakery. We have been going here for 5 years, since we found them for our wedding cake. The only bakery we use for all our events wedding, birthday, gender reveal, baby shower etc... We even saved the top of our wedding cake for our 1 year anniversary and when we ate it on our anniversary it was still delicious and moist. They are So great we have at least 4 other family members that will drive all the way from various locations they live just to get cakes from here for their events. You can definitely feel the love they put in their cakes and cupcakes.< /review>

That's a big deal since normally we always have cake left over. Not this time. They don't do fondant BUT definitely are able to work their artistic cake magic on the cakes. I got strawberry with cream cheese filling and chocolate with fresh strawberries. Highly recommend them.< /Review></record>

The owner has been making cakes since he was 17 I believe and he's great at it. You're getting not only an amazing looking cake here, you're also getting a delicious delicacy. The cake is moist and the filling is just the right amount, oh yea did I mention you get a filling of your choosing? Yea you're getting the best bang for your buck here.< /review><response>None<//response><date>1547113643452<//date>< Rate>

I can confidently say that I have almost tasted all of Lindmair Bakery. What I love about her cakes is how fresh and tasty they are. The cream that she uses is very light and NOT TOO SWEET. Which is exactly what I look for in a cake. Lindmair Bakery has done both my bridal shower and wedding cakes. Besides the quality of her cakes she is a great at listening, brainstorming on ideas, and  executing them.  She is also very positive and delightful to work with. I will definitely recommend her for your events.<//Review>

I have been ordering from this bakery from last 10 years, they haven't failed me yet. Best price ,best cake. Love their service. I ordered cake for my daughters wedding, it was under $250 for 80 people. Other fancy places wanted about $500. I strongly recommend them.🎂🍰👍</Text>

I ordered a custom cake design via email & sharing a picture from Pinterest of what I wanted. I explained what I wanted and the decorator asked a few questions and we agreed on how best for the idea to come together. I'd never ordered a custom cake before, but Lindmair made it an easy experience. The cake looked great and tastes even better. I'd definitely recommend this bakery to anyone in the area.<//review>

Best cakes in the IE, I live in Southwest Riverside and yes, I drive all the way to Riverside to pick up my cakes for all my events. This bakery makes the best whipped cream cakes and I've tried their butter cream and it is equally as delicious.  I would rather have a great tasting cake then those gum paste monstrosity that taste like junk.. cakes here are always moist and butter cream is just the right amount of sweetness if your looking for a good cake that everyone will compliment then this is the place!</Review>

<Text>Ordered a plain white flat sheet cake with pink polka dots for a baby shower. I was very dissapoonted with the way it looked. Although, it was plain,  it looked very cheaply made. Did not look like I bought from a bakery and was professionally done. The very small baby shower pin they added to the cake was a very old, dirty, dusty pin that looked like it had been sitting in a dusty box in someone's attic for years. The "it's a girl" writing was on placed on the upper left corner with very sloppy writing and could hardly be seen with how big the cake was. Customer service was very poor. I still had to go out to buy things to make that cake presentable. To top it off the cake was not good. Bread was not moist and frosting was very, very sweet. Too sweet. I will NEVER order from this place again. I've had better experiences and enjoyed better cakes at a local market or Costco.<//Text><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

Cake was amazingly good.
We ordered our wedding cake from here, and they worked with us to design something truly memorable. Cake was setup and delivered on time, and looked fantastic. We froze the top tier for our 1 year anniversery, and after letting it thaw for a few days in the fridge (in a Tupperware style container) it came out just as moist as our wedding day. Their baked good are always a treat, and even though we now live over an hour away, we still stop by once and awhile.</review>

<text>A group of friends and I celebrated our bestie's birthday last night for the first time at this escape room location. We chose the Prison Break room and it was a GREAT EXPERIENCE! Especially with GRAND MASTER ORANGE! Miss girl made this the best experience for us and was so helpful. LOVE HER. HIGHLY RECOMMEND HER 1000000/10!</text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPnPYGX2CX0suKqr4AIdIwX4auYxyRCAai3BKnL=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

Miss orange was our game master, and she was amazing. She gave us the most incredible time while we were here, she was so kind and very energetic. Her explanation was easy to understand and the whole experience was definitely something I will remember. The escape room we did was Prison Break, and it was difficult for sure, but we escaped it and had 14 minutes to spare!<//Review>

<text>Yes i love the place! it is my go to spot with my friends! today i went to play and i meet two great employees, cricket & Serena. Although it is very fun, i wouldn't recommend it to kids under the age of 10 who get scared very easily. Cricket was a blast and was such a hilarious host and Serena was just so nice! If you have younger kids i would definitely recommend Fair game, and with young adults i would recommend once upon a time.<//text><UserId.>116710121803917561192<//UserId.><gmapID>0x80856796296ff887:0x98d08a4c4d0d2776<//gmapID><Pics>None< /Pics>< date>

We had SO much fun here! We came in Tuesday and Goose was a high energy and fun game master! He definitely made it more fun. We did Once Upon a Time and enjoyed the surprises in there. Then we returned on Thursday for another escape room. Lauren, our game master was awesome as well and gave us helpful clues. They have a good team. It’s great for families and you can bring your kids!</text>

<Review>Had the best time here with the closing team on 4/27!! Orange, Lauren, and the rest of the staff were amazing hosts. We played Prison Break and had a great experience. We couldn’t have gotten through it if it weren’t for our amazing Game Master Orange! It was truly a superb experience. Thank you Red Door for the last minute Tuesday fun.< /Review><username>Emani</username></record></dataset><record>

Very fun! Did the “Fair Game” room and it was just the right amount of challenging. Felt super satisfied after finishing the room! And Abby, you were the best Game Master I could’ve hoped for.< /Review>

It's challenging and keeps you guessing the whole way. If you played the escape room video games, this experience gives you that same immersed feeling. Our game master was great and kept it real for us. Their protocols for the current pandemic make it private groups right now so it definitely a safe experience overall.</Text>< Pictures>

Ethan and Anna were an incredible duo! From check in to check out, they were fun, friendly and energetic! Totally got us hyped for the experience. 10/10 recommend! MAJOR THUMBS UP. Would give 10 stars if I could but google is stuck in the dark ages of the 5 star system.<//review>

Loved the room! It was the first time I went to this particular room with some friends and we kicked butt! McKenna was our game master and she was, not only delightful, but incredibly helpful along the way of our escape. Her pins were quite charming, like her. We’re booking the next room as I write this review (that’s how much we enjoyed it!)< /text>

Goose and Olivia were wonderful! Olivia made sure to check us in and allowed us to settle in before we started. Goose was an amazing game master. Throughout the game he was really encouraging and gave us hope to finish the game. My friends and I had an amazing time!<//Review>

Very fun and Immersive experience. Would recommend the room “cash me if you can” for more seasoned escapers. One of the more realistically cool rooms I’ve ever done. Was helped by Goose and coconut.

The warrior’s way was amazing. Our group had so much fun and Cricket was amazing in explaining to us the rules and introducing us to the room. I cannot wait to come back and do another room.</Review>

<Review>The employee named Cricket (anaya) is absolutely amazing! She literally made my friend & I 100% more comfortable than we were prior to meeting her. I had a lot of anxiety at first, but she made us feel completely comfortable and excited to experience this amazing time! Truly a blast & would recommend it to absolutely anyone! Again, Cricket was soooo amazing!<//Review>< response>

My friend and I came to Concord Red Door escape room tonight and it was a wonderful experience! The girls working were so kind, especially Anna and Olivia! She was absolutely fantastic and made our night. My friends and I are definitely coming back to this Red Door and requesting Anna. It was my first time doing an escape room and I was so impressed. Anna deserves a raise, she is so amazing. Thank you so much!<//text>

We came here for my daughter’s 6th birthday, per her request. It’s the 5th escape room my husband and I have done. We did Fair Game and had so much fun! We don’t do it competitively, so we do ask for clues when we get stuck, but the 5 of us (2 adults and 3 children ages 6-14) thoroughly enjoyed it!<//review>

Took my nephew and his friend to do Once Upon a Time. Even though we didn't finish it, we had a great time. Kiera was our Game Master and she did a great job at helping explain to us since it was our first time doing an escape room. Kiera also gave really good hints without just giving us the answer when we asked! Thank you, will be back for Fair Game soon!</Review>

orange and mckenna did their very best to accommodate us on a slightly busy St. Patricks night. It just made us enjoy the experience even more bc we got to play games in the party room while we waited a mere 10 minutes. So it flew by! During the game orange made jokes and made us laugh the whole time, a true game master.< /text>

<rating>5<//rating><review>By far the best escape room we have been too.  The puzzles, riddles, scenery, graphic details, people that work there & more is amazing!  I am so excited that it is local too!  We did the Once Upon A Time Experience.  Highly recommend for girl/Boy Scouts, family events, friends or just to get your mind thinking.

We went here a second time with a group of 11, it was still an amazing experience.

6 rooms to choose from which means 6 trips!< /review>< Date>

So, I’ve never been to a “Escape Room” and heard people talk about it and post about it. But now I did and I can talk about it! Hahaha.

The facility - 4 stars: If you haven’t been there, it was confusing to know and see where the entrance was. The Red Door is actually on the second floor. The facility itself is nice. The downstairs portion looks like “it’s community” meaning not necessarily for the Red Door Escape Room but you can use it. There’s a restrooms available downstairs and one upstairs in the vicinity of the Escape Room. The facility was nice and clean.

The Game - 5 stars: The game we chose was “Cash Me if You Can” the room was tiny but enough for seven people. Don’t know how the other rooms are since this was my first time. The game was pretty fun and challenging. It really requires brain power and communication. The set up is awesome and so are the props. They are things we would use in real life, no fake props. If you’re up for a challenge choose this game. This game is good for ages 7 and up as long as the young ones are with parents. I think this would also be good for a party or for out of towner visitors!!! I love the concept of no phones inside! I will be back to do other games!!!

The staff 5 stars: very nice, very helpful, and had smiles on their faces. What more can I say? And after we did our escape, they were willing to answer questions! Great job staff!!!< /review>

<Text>My fiance and I have done over 50 rooms and at the time of this review have only done Once Upon a Time with plans of finishing the others. It was a charming room that's definitely geared toward beginners on account it teaches you many escape game basics. I can say that Red Door is a welcome addition to the Concord area and if you are looking to tip your toes in the hobby, this is the place.<//Text><userid>117918332903066759179<//userid><pics>None<//pics></record>

Front desk worker McKenna made us feel welcome and constantly checked in with us to let us know when our room and gamemaster would be ready, and we had a pleasant chat.

Gamemaster Annecy did an outstanding job getting us hyped for our adventure and letting us know of the safety rules, assisting us when we got stuck and guiding us through expertly.

We were told about your free membership and immediately signed up along with buying a gift card to book another room in the future, the staff here made this so much fun we can't wait to go back!< /text><time>1606263271543< /time><Resp>None</Resp><gmapID>0x80856796296ff887:0x98d08a4c4d0d2776< /gmapID><rate>5< /rate>< Name>

<review>We had so much fun playing Prison Break with Tony as our game master.  I have visited the Red Door Escape Room locations in the Dallas metro and when I was coming out to California for business and found out they had locations here, it was a no brained for an awesome team building event!  They had Leah down at a kiosk in the courtyard talking about the games, helping book for clients, and directing traffic to the location (you have to enter through the office suites to get to the entrance on the second floor).  Mary the GM was wonderful and even took the time to explain all the different episodes to us so we would know what to select for our next event.  Serena warmly greeted me upon arrival and ensured I had everything I needed to make the event a success.  The event space is awesome!!! It has a lounge area and a space for us to have a meeting before playing our episode!  Love the package options.  Bravo Red Door Escape Room!<//review></record></dataset><record>

<Rate>5</Rate><text>Great place to begin your escape room experience. I definitely recommend "prison break" for first timers. It is challenging but worth the effort. The rooms are well thought out and the settings are believable. I will come back again to conquer the rest of their rooms.<//text>< pictures>

We’ve been three times now. A new exciting experience every time. We love getting our brains tested with all different variety of puzzles to solve! Crew is top notch. Great value to be had from their “frequent escaper” program. Plus a free experience for your birthday. More fun with more people!<//Review>

KYLE - You the realest! Thank you for making Greg's birthday a hit.

This place was so much fun! I brought my boyfriend here for a private escape room experience as a birthday gift and it was well worth the price - I only wish we could have done more of it. I will absolutely be bringing my friends and family back to do more escapes. Thanks Red Door :)<//Text>

What an amazing place for team building. The game masters are truly attentive and helpful. Been to other escape rooms for team building but this one is by far the best. Amazing and stimulating games and amazing staff. Especially Kyle, the game master, and Kristine who helped us booking it. We are are family business always looking to find places for our staff to do, and this is an amazing place to do it .

Much love,

Amazing experience!  We did Once Upon A Time with a whole family and everyone LOVED it!  It was easy enough for my kids to participate and be able to solve mysteries, yes challenging enough where we all had to engage to complete a task.  Definitely 5 starts from me!</Review>

<review>This escape room was super fun! Staff was super friendly! Me and my friends played Warrior's Way but only got through about half of it because we weren't super experienced and we chose a time late in night so we were all kinda tired (it was the only room that worked with our schedule but no regrets!). I highly recommend checking it out if puzzles and riddles are your thing! Would definitely go back and try the other episodes!<//review>< user>

My fiance and I have done over 50 rooms and at the time of this review have only done Once Upon a Time with plans of finishing the others. It was a charming room that's definitely geared toward beginners on account it teaches you many escape game basics. I can say that Red Door is a welcome addition to the Concord area and if you are looking to tip your toes in the hobby, this is the place.< /Text>

My family escaped from Warriors Way. It was an excellent room, beautifully laid out, challenging, and exciting. The master was great and the way to obtain clues is genius. My only complaint is that a key part of the puzzle malfuctioned. It was the last piece of the puzzle and the master had to come into the room and fix it. The malfunction was enough to cause frustration and a let down feeling. Aside from that it was fantastic. I hope management gets it fixed.<//review>

Fun experience and very friendly staff! Played Warrior's Way with my group and it was a BLAST! We escaped at the last few minutes and we were so excited that we went ahead and played another episode, Cash Me and enjoyed every minute! The rooms' design is impeccable and super immersive! Very well-designed puzzles and smart out-of-the-box solutions! We can't wait to try all the other games and become Red Key holders! Thanks to Red Door and the amazing friendly staff, we felt like we made new friendships!</Text>

So much fun!  We did cash me if you can, it was dynamic, fun, challenging and creative!  We left laughing and chatting about our experience for hours!  I highly recommend and am planning on coming back to try another room!</Review>

< Review>
Had a really fun experience here. Planned it for a group of friends and we had a blast. The front team and our helper were great. My only complaint is that when you book ahead, it isn’t convenient and the ability to get a refund doesn’t exist. So I booked a room that could hold 12 but we only had 9 people and so I booked and paid the extra so that it could just be our group. But I was worried to book because our 9 th person was iffy because she had surgery recently and wasn’t sure she would feel up to it. I decided to book anyway and stop delaying as I was afraid it would book up. She finally decided to bow out which was fine and I called and they let me switch to an eight person game. I expected a refund for the $40 additional I had paid since we switched games, but the worker was only allowed to give me a store credit. Her answer was simply, “The policy is we don’t do any refunds.” I am sorry, but that is ridiculous. They must be afraid of the merchant fee that comes from a return. Now I am stuck with $40 credit and a bad taste. I am not going to go an ask my friend who just had surgery to buy it off me as that would be rude and inconsiderate. We had another person cancel because of her twins having the flu and they gave me store credit for that which I thought was reasonable even though I didn't pay the $5 insurance. Their typical policy is have you pay $5 insurance you can cancel but you have to know you are going to be sick 24 hours in advance. And even then, I think you just get store credit ( I am not positive on that one, but that is what I recollect). How are you going to know you will be sick 24 hours in advance? It is frustrating because now that is money I am out for 2 people for the time being and it is just annoying enough where I won’t want to be the one the reserves for my group in the future. They need a better system to reserve.</Review>

Awesome experience! I went with my sister and her boyfriend and we had a blast playing Cash Me If You Can - unlike any escape room I had played before. They did the casino theme right and without giving anything away, the final room was super cool! Shout-out to Kobe, our game master!<//Text>

Fair Game was so much fun! Highly recommend going here if you are looking to have a blast! The staff was super nice and really made our experience great! Our game master, Aiden, absolutely killed it! He kept our group on track and we had a ball. Even when we felt as though all hope was lost, he was there to help us succeed when nobody else was.</Review>

Not to mention, the entire staff is AWESOME! Shout out to Marco and Thomas! They definitely made my experience much more worth it! I 10/10 recommend to try this place out :-D</Review>

This makes it feel like they are actively trying to make good experiences for everyone, which is my opinion deserves every star.

50/50 so far. Booked cash and prison break. Only two people so playing with strangers, not a big deal, we're used to it. Cash was fantastic, logical, well rounded, and had the benefit of additional optional puzzles. Top tier in design and execution. Prison break was dull, extremely linear, one puzzle gave you the clue for the only remaining lock. Very small rooms for prison, which is a problem when you aren't booking the room. Also a problem when there's only one thing for all 7 people to crowd around. One puzzle required a very specific placement of items on a wall, we assumed we missed something when it was just a matter of wiggling everything until the lock activated. Another puzzle piece broke completely and required assistance, and another puzzle we solved before we even had the pieces for it (see earlier remark about trying to find something to look at while everyone else was crowded in a corner). Brought these points up to staff who said "it's supposed to be like that, we have cash me if you can for larger groups like yours". Again, there were 7 people from three groups in our room, none of us booked together. Was going to come back about weekend and do the rest, probably just going to pass.</Text><user_name>Nicholas Thornton</user_name></record>

<review>We had a great time!  I did this for my 50th birthday with my family.  We did the Prison Break escape room.  There were 5 of us and we worked in teams for certain puzzles, and sometimes we all worked together.  The youngest person was 21 years old, but I think a 13 or 14 year old could do it with adults. Two of us had done a couple escape rooms, but for three of us, it was our first time. We were able to break out of prison, and we figured out all the clues.  A couple times we considered asking for a hint, but we didn't.  We kept trying different ideas, and eventually were able to figure the puzzles out.  It wasn't too easy and it wasn't too difficult.  In looking back, each person took a turn figuring out different clues.  If I had been by myself or with just one friend, I don't think I could have figured out all the clues by myself.  So it really took a team effort, and we were able to work together, and just had a great time. The hour flies by!!  I can't wait to do another one. Our gamemaster was Leah - she was great!</review><pics>None< /pics><response>{'time': 1567665454656, 'text': 'Woohoo! Thank you for the fantastic review, Charmaine. Leah is AWESOME!

<rate>1</rate><text>One of the worst experiences I have ever had.  All of the themes are stolen from different movies and they use Disney characters in some of their episodes, not very creative at all.  The staff is obviously trained to make you feel special but as soon as you are done you can tell it was just part of their job.  They preach authenticity but then have their employees write fake google reviews for them.  Cheaply done and not very creative or original at all.  The manager Marco is a little creepy as well.</text>< Pictures>

<text>As an escape room enthusiast (30+ rooms) I was excited to see another room coming to the area. The Bay Area has such high quality rooms and I was curious if Red Door would hold up to the best of em. And I'm glad to say it does! Not only was the room super immersive (we played Once Upon a Time) but the staff and guest experience were the best I've seen!! They were all super friendly and knowledgeable, and they helped us have a good time. Shoutout Kobe!!< /text><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

We did the Prison Break room with 5 experienced escapers and 1 noob. It was a decent room, all equipment in solid working order. Staff was friendly and attentive even though the place was really busy. We escaped in 27 minutes (supposedly 2nd place for the room) so it was decidedly on the easier side. Probably really good for people who haven't been before or who have only done one or two rooms. Definitely will get you grounded in the concepts without being unescapable for new people.</Review>

I loved it! It was very challenging but so much fun! I did the Warrior's Way but didn't escape. Womp womp. They came to show us but I left because I'm planning on going back.

I'd suggest doing Warrior's Way with a group of people you know becuase communication is key!<//Text>

Big shout out to the managers Jarick and Mary for always being on top of their game, making the place look squeaky clean, organized and nice! Also, big shout out to front desks and game masters, Holly, other front desk person that wears glasses and helped me get my new gear that I totally forgot your name, Loui, and Leah! (I apologize if I spelled your names wrong!) hands down, deserved more than 5 stars! Keep up the great work body-every!<//Text>< pics>

This place is amazing!!! They have one of the best staff that I have ever seen from front deskMcKenna to our game master Louis. They were so welcoming, friendly, and energetic that it pumped us up for our game. We didn’t Escape but we’ll back get that We Escaped sign. Also huge shout out to management Marco and Thomas they know what they are doing keep it up and we’ll see you next time. Ooga-chaka Ooga-OogaOoga-chaka Ooga-Ooga, and Theodoro.< /review>
