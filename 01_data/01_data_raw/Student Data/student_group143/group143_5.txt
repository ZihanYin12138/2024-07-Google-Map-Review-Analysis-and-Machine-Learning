<review>Loved this place for a few reasons. Friendly staff, quick stop and honest. It’s just a smog that you can get anywhere but this place is better than the surrounding shops in sketchy areas because it’s not in a sketchy area.  They take cc, cash, and Apple Pay which adds to the convenience.</review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

I can't emphasize this enough. This place is the best smog shop I have ever been to. They were professional, fast, and very affordable. I am not a bot or a friend doing a review. I found them from a google search and they happen to be close to my house. I have been to the scam type smog shops, and this is NOT that type of shop. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!<//Text>

Needed a smog on my car by a STAR certified location so I called The Smog Spot and Sunny was able to get me an appt within 30 min from the time I called. When I got there, he was able to get me in and out in 15 min. Great service and experience, will def go back next year for my annual smog.</text>

<text>I recently needed my 2012 Honda Civic smoged but I had questions on if the car was ready or not since I just had my battery changed at Elk Grove Honda and was advise to drive the car for about 100 miles. Sonny was able to quickly check to see if the car was ready and get me on my way with my smog inspection. The shop looks pretty good and the waiting room had a TV but it didn't feel like I was there very long. I'm glad I've found this shop. I'll definitely be back soon for my other cars!<//text>< pics>

< Review>
I was impressed with the waiting area!! They had the ac blasting on a hot day which was a major plus while getting my smog done. Sonny was quick but efficient. Great promotional deal right now. I called around and this was the cheapest price around. I will definitely recommend to friends and family.< /Review>

< Review>
Brought my tahoe in for a simple smog.  Absolutely awesome staff! I forget then gentleman's name precisely, and I know I put their cars around here somewhere, but the Hispanic fellow, about 5'11-ish, heavy build, great dude! Superb customer service, his associate as well, the asian gentleman (again, sorry I forget their names).

Only needed to ask me a few questions and get the info from my vehicle and had the job done pretty quick. I was their last client for the day and I was having a hell of a time trying to prioritize a couple errands (gas cap seal was ineffective so I needed to replace first otherwise the machine would throw am immediate fault and fail the test) that nearly ended with me not being able to return for the day.

But the gentleman informed me that if I could try and make it back ASAFP, he would hold the shop open for about 15 minutes late (I think because he already had everything typed into the system and only needed to get the whip on the machine and run the test (which is relatively quick and easy process for the technician) but fortunately I was able to make it back with some time to spare and not require him to stay very late.

If you check my review log, you'll see that I don't write too many review, as I'm sure too many of us miss the opportunity to let people know how our experience was (believe me, there are MANY instances where negative reviews could clearly demonstrate that some employees absolutely trash a company's reputation or at least location, costing the business..  only God knows, how much, in the long run.

This is, for as long as I reside in the greater Sacramento area, my #1 Smog Spot! Thanks guys, stellar service and representation!</Review>

Great store, funny staff/,mgmnt, the guys are a bit reserved at first, but once they see you the third time they treat you GREAT. They have almost everything you'd want, and if they don't have it, they'll order it for you, or tell you where you can get it.<//Text>

< Review>
Got a pizza, some garlic bread and some wedge potatoes from this place for dinner. The potato wedges were yummy, the garlic bread had cheddar cheese in it and was surprisingly good. The California veggie pizza was interesting and tasty, but the best thing was their pesto sauce we got on the side.< /Review>

I called in, and ordered 2 king size 3 topping pizzas, and letting them know I purchased a 2 for 1 coupon. I was told it would be $22.53. Unfortunately,  when I arrived to pick up the pizzas, I was Informed that the total was $38.93. They told me it was the price of one regular pizza. I was gob smacked and had to walk out. I do not patronize businesses which engage on fraudulent and/ or false advertising. Beware, shop elsewhere.<//Text>< pictures>

Very good pizza and the staff is friendly and nice. Family environment and very welcoming. Just wish that the arcade machine wasn't soooo obnoxious.< /review>

<review>Great customer service, but the pizza is honestly bad. I ordered a Hawaiian pizza and the cheese wasn't melted well. There's lots of tomato sauce. The pizza tastes horrible. Other than the pizza, my little brother really enjoyed the games and prizes they have there. The design is beautiful like a typical pizza place.< /review><userid>115216592379362525823</userid><GmapID>0x80ec6c0aedb5ed0f:0x69354b9df2afe849</GmapID><Time>1560206451957</Time>< name>

By far, Straw Hat Pizza is the best pizza place in town. I miss so much the little Snoopy ride, It was my favorite. Also they have great service. Thank you</Review>

< Review>
Straw hat is one of my fav spots! The toppings are delicious,Always fresh. The salad bar is always clean and I love their potato salad it's really good considering I'm picky. The hot wings were hot and good! We come here regularly,there are weekly specials so there's always a deal! Wether you're getting the lunch deal or dinner deal. The perfect place to bring your family. I love coming here because my son loves all the games,He always takes prizes home. Good pizza and games< /Review>

The salad bar has a lot to be desired for 7 Bucks I can name what they had macaroni salad potato salad beets lettuce two or three kinds of dressing a Jell-O salad some corn tomatoes so that's about it no croutons or raisins or nuts or any other veggies.
I don't believe I'll be going back<//Review>

This place seems to be a bit out of my comfort zone when relating to price. If the quality was a bit better, I would consider this as an option when dining out.<//Review>

<Review>(Translated by Google) I had a very bad experience I am waiting for almost 20 minutes and my pizza was ready as 10 minutes before asking me in Handler and he told me what it takes then they went to check me pizza and I was ready in nothing else they are not paying attention to the work that they are doing I can't understand a customer waiting when their order is ready

(Original)

<rating>3< /rating><Text>Nice staff and great help when purchasing stuff from them. Their repairs are sub par though. I feel like every job I have had done here has been rushed and incomplete and I have to do more work or bring my bike right back in. At first I put it down to bad luck but with it happening so often, and having been to other shops without these issues, I think I will have to go elsewhere for servicing.<//Text><Response>{'time': 1605748921470, 'text': "We're very sorry you had a bad experience.

<review>Daniel from Velopro was a huge help with my first new mountain bike purchase. The staff explained the differences in models I was looking at (Santa Cruz Hightower vs Megatower) over multiple visits browsing during these interesting social distancing times. After riding them multiple times in the parking lot, they sent me on my way with a demo bike for the day. This allowed me to see it in action and determine that the fit would be comfortable. The fees for the demos sum up at the end and are applied to the bike purchase. Once done, they helped without rush any finishing touches such as pedals and water bottle setup. I was apprehensive to spend the amount that I did, but I do believe I am in good hands for future service as well. I hope to have them help with a Grip2 upgrade and Carbon wheels soon enough! Thanks guys, your patience was key, and the experience at both locations (SB and Goleta) is stellar.<//review>< username>

They were nice guys, helpful and knowledgeable. I was a bit upset that they broke one of my shifter pods (XT) and replaced it with a much lower end unit then didn't tell me...I had to figure it out. That's just bad business. The kid discounted my bill significantly when I called him out on it and was apologetic. Real bummer is that my bike is older and finding an XT shifter pod is nearly impossible.</Text>

I had really wanted to get into cycling for long time and finally got the courage to go into VeloPro. I was immediately amazed by the friendly staff,  and received exceptional customer service from Tyson. He walked me through a huge amount of knowledge, advice and gear mechanics in an easy-to-digest yet very thorough manner. This is now my go-to spot for all things cycling!</Text>

Went in for a biannual tire rotation and Don was nice enough to suggest a rim job. Another guy covered in poorly done tattoos pointed out my blinker fluid should be replaced regularly. As I was wrapping up and about to leave a very friendly homeless man that was trimming the trees sold me a stolen bicycle for super cheap.

Great shop. 5 stars.</Review>

<Text>What a great experience. I was in SB for a few days and wanted to hire a decent bike for a couple of rides. "Decent" doesn't quite describe just how great their hire bikes were. They were also very helpful, easy-going and generous with advice and setup.

If I'm ever fortunate enough to be in Santa Barbara again, I wouldn't hesitate to return and if I ever lived here I certainly could imagine buying a bike here from their great range.<//Text>< GmapID>

Velo Pro has been our bike shop of choice for 14 years.  Not only have we purchased several bikes there, they have also repaired flats, replaced rims, tires and brakes, adjusted gears, honored warranty parts, suggested top-quality gear.  They are passionate and knowledgeable about bikes and biking.  They score in every category.  We always walk out happy and satisfied.  Thank you for your service all these years.  The dogs are great too!</Review>

<Rating>5<//Rating><text>Can’t express my gratitude enough for the folks at Velo Pro. During my recent trip to CA I encountered a problem with my rear hydraulics - rendering me without a rear brake at all. With several more days of descending on the agenda, I needed to take care of the situation quickly.

I found Velo Pro on the interwebs and stopped in the next morning. Immediately, I was greeted in a friendly and welcome manner. I was escorted to the shop where they listened to my situation and committed to taking a look at my bike within the hour. They recommended an amazing place to grab breakfast (Jeannine’s) while waiting for my bike to be repaired. A little over an hour later I got the call that my bike was fixed and ready to roll!

After a quick stop to Whole Foods to pick up a couple 6-packs of hoppy gratitude, I headed to the shop. The repair work was done promptly AND done correctly.

We rolled from the shop and headed up (and down) Gibraltar. Needless to say, I was extremely grateful to have my rear brake functioning for the descent down Painted Cave!

I would highly recommend Velo Pro and am very thankful for their excellent support and service! Was an extra bonus that they were a Specialized dealer as well as Transition, KONA, and Pivot👍

Thanks fellas!

Rick

<Review>Very unsatisfied with the member of staff I spoke too and will not be a customer at VeloPro from now on and will definitely tell others not to shop there. The member of staff was more interested in closing down the shop before closing time than they were in making a $400-$500 sale. I was going to buy several Brooks Saddles and received a look of I’m too busy. The date I attempted to shop was 4-11-2018; fire the liability please before more people turn to Amazon/EBay to buy their cycles/parts. He just cost you thousands of dollars of potential future profit. Hope you enjoy my review more than I enjoyed your point of sale, really shouldn’t be too hard.<//Review>< Pictures>

Took a bike I bought off Craigslist to these guys. They did a general tune up and helped me out with some of the compatibility issues with the hardware the previous owner installed. Great service!<//Review>

<Time>1524694419523<//Time><Rate>5</Rate><review>I really can't say enough positive about this bike shop. They've been taking care of me since I was a totally broke college kid back in 2010, and needed help keeping my bike running to get to class. Over the years, they have just continued to improve, with amazing staff, clean stores, a great selection of bikes, and lots of stock. They're one of the few stores in the area that also has female staff, which means my girlfriend can ask questions about women's cycling stuff and get answers from an actual woman. They are always happy to answer any questions about bike stuff, and never make you feel dumb for asking. It's just a hugely positive and encouraging place, and you can tell the staff really care and are passionate about cycling and seeing people on the bikes that are best for their needs. Since college I've purchased two bikes from them, and have had multiple friends buy bikes from them on my recommendation. The service is so top notch that i never hesitate to recommend this shop to anyone for any bike related needs.< /review>< pics>

<Rate>1</Rate><review>I went in to buy a pump and lube on Saturday, March 26th. I made my choices and got in line behind a guy who was picking up a bike. The young lady who was helping him had her breakfast out on the counter. There were five people working in the store. I waited. She made eye contact and she asked "Colin" if the back register was open. He said yes. No movement to the back register. It seemed Colin was more interested in working on making a sale. I waited. And waited. I finally put the pump and lube back and left. I used the app Bike Shops in North America to find the closest shop. I went to a different shop, got what I wanted, and had a nice visit with the shop guys. Not a good experience at Velo Pro.<//review>< pics>

The entire crew that works there are not just friendly and helpful from the moment you walk through the door but damn funny too, especially Keeton who helped me out. He spent a lot of time looking for a road bike in my budget, made sure I road tested anything I wanted and got me fitted. I bought a Specialized Allez and its perfect!!! Thanks Keeton and Velo Pro, you have a customer for life.<//Text>

<Rate>5<//Rate><text>The new Velo Pro Santa Barbara bike shop location at 15 Hitchcock Way in Santa Barbara is great, with a nice showroom filled with a huge selection of bicycles, lots of bicycle accessories and bicycle clothing and excellent bicycle repair service area. This is quite a move up from the previous Velo Pro location in downtown Santa Barbara. Velo Pro has Specialized Bicycles, Kona Bikes, Santa Cruz, Linus,  with a great selection of road bikes, mountain bikes, kids bikes, BMX and city urban or fitness bikes. Velo Pro Cyclery has a great repair department and services all types of bicycles. The Velo Pro Goleta bike shop has been in the same location for over 30 years. Velo Pro offers bicycle rentals and bike demos, where you can ride it before you buy it.<//text>< pics>

Attended their special evening exhibition and reception.
What a great event!
Exhibition of Japanese Encampment during WWII was both thorough and touching. The human spirit shines through those artifacts even after more than 70 years!
Staff at HAHS continues doing great jobs!
(BTW, good time to shoot the hippest restaurant in Hayward area!)<//review>

<text>A free small intimate museum that is educational about the main people who make up Hayward, Castro Valley, Ashland and San Lorenzo.  As an added bonus, there is a separate children area for kids to pretend to work in a grocery store, hotel, dress up and fish for fishes. A really nice place to take children and learn something yourself after eating at the Cannery, a yummy breakfast/lunch eatery.  It is connected next to the museum.</text><user>112279568049511296279</user><rate>4<//rate>< Pics>

<Review>Get some context to help you appreciate where Hayward has been and where it is going by checking out this little gem of a museum. There's a fun kids section in the back and exhibits explaining the roots of several different communities that have made Hayward home for generations.< /Review>< Date>

A reminder of how Hayward was in a long distant past.
The museum is very instructional, there is a cafe within the building serving a variety of good food.
Great for schools field trips, the staff members are friendly and have a vast knowledge of Hayward history.<//review>

<text>Friendly people works/ volunteers here. They welcome you with a big smile. Place is very clean. On second Thursdays of the month, they have Tot time activities for only $5. Also have a breakfast place inside called Cannery Cafe. They serve delicious sandwiches and breakfast items. Also have some great employees and customer dervice as well. A nice little gem found in Hayward.< /text>< rate>

If you have not recently visited the Hayward historical Museum I want to encourage you to do it now, today! The displays are just remarkable. If you are new to this area it will be very informative. If like me you have been here all your life, you will have the opportunity to enjoy historical memorabilia that is just beyond delightful. And when you visit the museum, be sure to have cited breakfast or lunch at The Cannery Cafe. Their offerings are delicious and a nutritious. Don't wait go soon!<//Review>

Good brunch spot, creative and tasty selections! A few vegetarian options as well. Love their home-made potato chips! Cannery Cafe not open every day, so check first.< /Text>

If you have not visited recently, put it on your to-do list immediately. Due to the donation of a long-term Hayward attorney, Mr Martins, you no longer need to pay an entrance fee.

What a cute little way to spend your time during the day on a weekend. We just happened to stumble in after eating breakfast in the attached Cafe.

The museum is free for at least the next two years! It was sweet to see all the old school utensils and tools that were used in the mid-1900s. Also, it was really cool to see how a cannery works, even though it was the children's exhibit.

We stayed for a free presentation about African American civil liberties, then and now. We ended up winning a calendar in a raffle, and staying for 4 hours! It was a delightfully surprising day.<//Review>

<Text>Seabrisas is the best restaurant in hollister for sure and possibly the best in san benito county.  I am a rib eye steak person, but I would choose their wasabi encrusted ahi tuna over the best steak I have ever eaten.<//Text>< Rate>

Everyone in the east bay should visit this humble and well appointed museum. The current special exhibit on Japanese Internment in this country is poignant and profound.</text>

When I moved to Hayward this was one of the first places I went. They did a fabulous job of relaying the history of Hayward to their audience through the use of photos, text and old automobiles. I enjoyed all that I learned as it allowed me to love my new home even more. The kids section was pretty cool too.

And I was so happy to learn that educators get a discount! Woot woot! Oh and ask them about field trips as well.</Text>

<text>Do not book at all costs! Very unreliable as we booked for 4 people online and when we got there we waited 15 minutes for someone to open the door or respond to our phone call. After someone answered they gave us a weak excuse and said that there is no way they'll let us in. This was humiliating and unexcusable. They need to run their business better if they except to stay in business instead if cancelling appointments for no reason. I hope I get a refund as soon as possible as I am not willing to have to talk to their poor customer service ever again.< /text><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>{'time': 1618242375368, 'text': "Dear Abdullah, we at Hatch are terribly sorry for your experience.  After being closed for more than a year due to COVID-19, we were hoping to reopen last weekend, but because all escape rooms were reopening at the same time, there was a rush in our industry to secure insurance, and so we were not able to reopen when we expected we would.  We're not sure how you were able to book on Sunday as had blocked all the slots as soon as it became apparent that we wouldn't have the insurance in time.  Apparently there must have been a glitch in the software that allowed your last-minute booking.  Your refund has been issued, of course, and we'd love to have you back now that we are finally ready to reopen.  Please forgive us.  It has been a trying year for all of us."}< /resp><gmapID>0x80c2b867ce14e8eb:0x277c1af3ad0f1361< /gmapID></record>

< review>
I've done over 90 escape rooms across SF, Seattle, New Orleans, and now finally LA. Based on reviews, maze rooms seem to be a mixed bag of wildly varying quality, so we were a bit apprehensive to check them out. Magic Kingdom was the mostly highly rated experience out of the Hatch Escapes Rooms and was supposed to be a magical experience. One of the people in our group loves magic themed rooms, so we decided to check it out.< /review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><text>This is a great room! I would highly recommend it. There were 2 of us that are experienced and we escaped right at the end. This room had a lot of very unique parts/puzzles and that's from someone that has done 250+ rooms. There was plenty of space and plenty to do to have a bigger group too. I enjoyed the opening video a lot too. I saw this room being rated super high, even top 10 in the world, and was worried it couldn't live up to that type of rating. It makes my top 10 list for sure! I hope Hatch builds another room!!!</text>< GmapID>

<Name>Rebecca Chapin</Name>< Review>
Visited Hatch's lab rat room about six months ago and I catch myself comparing every room I've been to since to it. Of all the 15 or so LA escape rooms I've been to, including the ever famous 'basement', the lab rat room has hands down been the best.

The set design and room concept are both very strong. It features a lot of puzzle varieties that are rarely utilized in escape rooms so it feels fresh even to an escape room enthusiast. The amount of puzzles are also very well calculated, you won't walk away feeling like it was too easy. Definitely would recommend. The only downside is it can get pretty hot in the room, even with the portable AC units that are present.</Review>

<Review>This was my first experience going to an escape room, and I thought it was a fun experience. The puzzles were challenging, but we were able to finish with 22 seconds left on the clock with hints from our game master. The quality of the videos and props were great. Street parking, but not terrible... We found something on the next block.</Review>< pics>

Well thought out and decorated theme. We escaped and enjoyed ourselves immensely.  I can't wait for them to build their next room. I hope they maintain the quality and standards.  Also your sectional is hella comfy.  If I could I'd totally nap all day on it.< /Text>

<review>I can't even explain how much I liked this escape room. The puzzles were all different, and engrossing. They demanded all kinds of different levels of communication, and teamwork, and sensory modalities, and reasoning styles. It was a fast-paced, dynamic, and totally social experience that never let up.

Top notch, recommended to everyone.<//review>< pictures>

The immersion experience was phenomenal, the host added enthusiasm to the experience, and the presentation was extremely entertaining. My only criticism would be that the clues were not organized in a linear fashion (this then that) and so the progression of the escape was a tiny bit discombobulated.< /Text>

So this was my 50th escape room and I wanted it that way based on all the reviews and top ten lists I found it on. The reviews were correct! This was my favorite so far. So many unique puzzles, incredibly immersive, and lots to do! If you do escape rooms this should be in your must do list. If you don't,  you will be an addict after this!<//Review>

For starters, the room is presented as a theater/art piece rather than an escape room, which dives deeply into the concept on an escape room and pushes it into the "next generation" of gameplay. Speaking of gameplay, the puzzles in Lab Rat were all immense, brilliant, and best of all, required the entire team to solve, traversing a massive and highly detailed set. The room itself was scaled up to fit with the theme, using specific details to provide clever twists on popular culture as entirely original designs that facilitated the puzzles throughout the game. In as vast a market as Los Angeles, Hatch Escapes stands out as one of the absolute must-plays in the area, for both beginners and enthusiasts.</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None< /Response><GmapID>0x80c2b867ce14e8eb:0x277c1af3ad0f1361<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Great escape room.  I hadn't done one before, and went with only one other person, so it made it much more challenging, however the staff was super friendly, and made our experience top notch.<//text>

My favorite escape room so far, super fun, great great production and the guy explaining everything was very nice, friendly with a big smile, not like other escape rooms with people hating life lol. Also I would give them an extra star if I could, for the free coffee 😊🖤</Review>

By far... the coolest and most immersive escape room yet. Only sad I have to wait til they open the next one(s). I highly recommend this experience, especially if you like puzzles.< /Text>

Brilliant! I've never experienced any escape room that is close to Lab Rat. Everything fits, many unique puzzles and the decor, story and game master Agust were nice. I would recommend Lab Rat to every escape room enthousiast who visits or live in L.A. (better than the Hollywood sign 😉)<//review>

Nice park, sometimes too busy, but always worth a stop! Bathrooms are cleaned regularly, and for the most part, the trash is taken care of . The play ground is newer, the swings always work, and they even have a  basketball area plus ample parking spaces! ball field and large, fully fenced, dog run adjoins this family fun area, and its thick, dark grass is well maintained as well. This park borders a nearly year round Creek, but the safety of the children,( and their families that come here) is assured by chain link fencing.
Will definitely return!!<//Review>

<review>My experience at the Lions Club Park was a good one. I've been to this park a few times and the park has all the things you'd need for a family outing, birthday party, etc. Grill, benches to sit, horse shoe pits, a volley ball net with sand, two water faucets, men's/women's, bathroom's. Each time I've spent time there I've made great memories.</review><gmapID>0x80817973b2237075:0xa69527f718c101c8< /gmapID><Resp>None< /Resp><username>Reuben Pinola< /username><pictures>None<//pictures><rate>5</rate></record></dataset><record>

Nice County Park in Redwood Valley.  Has a baseball field, swings and play structures for kids.  Large covered structure with plenty of picnic tables.  Large bar b que pits.  A good place for large gatherings, or just an hour's playtime for the kids.<//text>

Good communication, reasonable prices and there are still willing to work on the old stuff. They smogged my 86 Motorhome they tested, repaired a few faults and retested.  While they had it I asked them to also do general service. They charged me a reasonable price for the work done. They did it quickly and it was a zero hassle experience. I will be using them again.< /review>

Terry,  the mechanic that does the work on my truck is the best. The service in the front office is knowledgeable and amazing. I always receive call backs with updates to keep me informed on what is happening (never left wondering what's going on). I will be coming here for as long as I am in the area . Thanks for being a reliable,  inviting shop in a world where it's hard to find a shop that can be trusted.< /Review><user>100212497927321944077<//user><user_name>Chris Teafatiller< /user_name><response>{'time': 1546117965449, 'text': 'Thanks so much for your feedback Chris!

<Review>Dave's Auto is one of the best and most reliable auto repair shops I've ever used. I trust them implicit with the repairs of my truck and car. The staff provides fantastic customer service!  I would highly recommend them for any auto repairs needed for your vehicle.< /Review><name>Joe Clark< /name>< gmap_id>

I have been a customer of Dave's Auto for 12 years. Through these years, I have been consistently impressed by the quality and reliability of service and by the courtesy and efficiency of the office staff. They take the time to explain automotive needs, and offer alternative solutions to vehicle problems. In addition, they are on a first name basis with their customers and treat them like family. I would never take my automobile anywhere else.< /text>

<Text>This is an email from Rv & auto parts dated April 23 2018.

Hello,
Thank you for your recent $196 order (1-116127). We apologize for delay, but unfortunately our shipment of UNI. Molding is taking much longer than expected.

Part  20-1309 is not in stock in the quantity that you’ve ordered. I do only have 3 in stock at this time.

Please let us know if you would like for us to modify/cancel/ or wait for your order.

We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience, and we greatly appreciate your patience.

Thank you,

I have been patiently waiting because I really want the parts. I have called several times only to get a response that “the manufacturer doesn’t respond, so do I want the three that they have or my money back?” What I want is what I ordered over three months ago!

If I ever get my order filled I will never do business with these clowns again. I recommend the same for the rest of the world  I have called several times only to get a response that the manufacturer doesn’t respond, so do I want the three that they have or my money back. What I want is what I ordered three months ago. If I EVER get my order filled I will never do business with these clowns again. I recommend the same for the rest of the world.

Update; I called again today they still had no answers  as to when they would have all six pieces and offered me the two pieces they had in stock. I give up! Cancel the order and supposedly getting a refund.</Text>< Pictures>

<Review>My husband has been using Dave's for quite some time now, and I finally took the time to bring my car instead of going elsewhere.
I could not be happier with my decision! Not only was the service efficient, but they made me feel like such a valued customer even on my first visit.
Kim took the time to really explain the work that was being done on my car, and also let me know of things that could pose a problem in the future, and what I can do to avoid large expensive repairs in the future.
Thank you Dave's for your commitment to amazing customer service, as well as being educational for your customers!< /Review>< gmap_id>

This auto shop is my “go-too” for all my auto’s. They have properly maintained my vehicles for years, everything from the simple oil changes to more complex diagnostic, trouble shooting issues.....always come back as they’veput  “my”needs 1st. Not “theirs”. Honestly, this is a small community, and it’s not often that an auto shop makes you feel like family. And that, is why they’ve earned my buiseness, and kept me driving safely on down the road. They’re just an old fashioned, honest, hard working team that continues to use old world, hard working values, that keep me coming back. Highest respect</Review>

< Review>
I took my truck in for a smog and found it didn't pass due to a faulty sensor in my tank.  after taking out the tank and replacing the sensor the warning light still was on so they said they needed to charge me for another diagnostic.  I was over a barren so I told them to go ahead.  They also told me that there is a government discount that if it cost over 500 dollars to fix my truck to make it pass smog then the state would pay for the rest.  well.... it ended up costing me 1000 dollars and when I got the bill after I picked it up I was told that that state government program was no longer there so I needed to pay the whole thing.  My truck had to sit there for a couple of weeks while I came up with the money.  after paying them off I drove my truck for about a week and the service engine light came on again.  I also now have issues with power and my gas gauge is messed up!!!!  I refuse to ever take my cars back to Dave's and if you are smart, you will not either!!!!  Unfortunately the only recourse I have for such poor service is to tell my story and hope that others will read it before they decide to take there car in.<//Review>

<resp>None</resp><Text>The most terrible service I have ever received.  I was hopeful that I might find a chassis service shop for my motorhome in Ramona.  Took it in with an intermittent starter problem.  Their solution was to start it once a day and put me off for three weeks.  Finally pulled the job and brought it to The Diesel Man in Escondido who immediately crawled under the coach, pulled the starter, brought it to a local shop and had it tested on the bench.  In the meantime, he found two loose wires to the starter and one to the cranking batteries, either of which could have been the problem .  Short story, in less than one day, problem solved.  The folks at Dave's are nice enough, just totally incompetent.< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><GmapID>0x80dbe8a38d4a5f8f:0xa529294f86b6e2ee<//GmapID><time>1505433419387</time>< rate>

I have been using Dave's for a number of years, starting with my work van after finding they accept Enterprise fleet services. The girls there treated me like we were family. They were prompt, if there were additional recommendations they notified me promptly. They have since done work on my personal vehicles , helping me make sure they were safe enough for my sons to travel cross country....with not one problem...i have taken my mom's car there..my mom's friend's car and they were happy to help ..even to the point of letting her take the car even though she didnt have all the money ro complete the bill , which she promptly did on her payday...the people at Dave's are great! They get all my buisiness and i tell every one i know about my dealings with them..top notch service with a smile..i will not go anywhere else..5 stars !!!</review>

<Name>Sandy Martinez<//Name><Review>Dont go here. Major rip off. Tell you one thing and you pay for the service but they want to charge you for another service without completing the first. Followed their advive only to return for tha service but want to charge you for another. Dispute what they said and tell them they didnt mention the new charge and Kim will tell you to leave the property or she will call the police. What a way to handle customer service.<//Review><rating>1< /rating>< gmap_id>

I do not trust anyone else to touch my vehicles. Over the past 15 years Dave's Auto has always taken care of my vehicles. Hate to take my car to the dealer instead of Dave's Auto even when  warranty is covering the work . As a response to the angry people who are not satisfied. I do notice that every one of them could not pass smog or had to spend more money than they wanted to due to more problems with there vehicles than they were aware of. Thats life.<//text>

If you don’t believe in diagnostics getting the run around and throwing parts and money at your vehicle until they get lucky and something finally works this is the place for you , although I don’t recommend it and would give minus five stars if possible<//review>

A gentleman was on the phone there and then walked away to the back as well, no one was around! I waited and said hello can someone ring me up, the lady walked back and said ya she will be with you in a moment, I didnt see any other women!

Seems like whenever I look something up online it's a certain price, and when I pick it up at the store it's a more expensive price. They don't pull orders when I call ahead of time and ask em to pull my order. That's even if i don't have to call 3 times first because the phone will ring so many times that a busy signal finally comes on. This isn't a reliable parts store. Think I'll stick to Pep Boys.< /text>

I called and asked about a part I had purchased at another O Reilly's store that was defective. The guy helping me on the phone found my previous order and verified that he had the replacement. The part was waiting for me at the counter when I arrived and as usual with them, there was no charge for the replacement.</Text>

Very friendly, great prices!<//Text>< Pics>

My daughter visit us from Sacramento California. She mentioned that her mechanic told her to change the transmission fluid. He could do it for $200. We asked Erick from O'Reilly. He was so helpful. Even game me pictures of Filling/Drain Transmission fluid scheme. Superb service and good prices. They even offered to change wipers on my daughter's car in rain season.</review>

I asked to use a battery tester and the employee gave me an attitude and said NO! They should just take down the free battery tester poster on the window
Went across the street to autozone and they were more then gladly to help
Used the tester and bought a new battery from autozone< /Review>

<Text>(Translated by Google) Is good attention bad thing is that if they are taking and the phone rings fail to meet the people and give preference to the phone that's too bad why sometimes are queuing to attend to you and them with the phone and while you dispatchers should not do that I think

(Original)
Es buena la atención lo malo es que si están atendiendo y suena el teléfono dejan de atender a las personas y le dan preferencia al teléfono eso es muy malo por qué a veces estA haciendo cola para que te atiendan y ellos con el teléfono y mientras te atienden no deben hacer eso creo yo</Text>< pictures>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Review>Went in today for a hair cut   and have the Wonderful pleasure of meeting Sonny  who took care of me    not only did my hair cut come out Fantastic   he was a great personality with good conversation. I' usually don't get a haircut in the areas being that I stay in the valley but I will definitely be back here for my future haircuts  totally worth the trip  (the real ones know if you find a Great Barber  that can cut you up  you stick with em  ) Go check em out "The Barber Shop" is where it's at !!!    Thanks Sonny 😁</Review><pics>None</pics>< resp>

Really great service, if this place wasn't as small it would be a great dinner location for date night or familiar occasions. Not a bar but that would be a great spot for bar and drink because the food size is amazing and the flavors are so good I thought they had my grand ma working in the back with all her secrets!< /text>

<text>This place is great.  Modern and clean Mexican counter service eatery. Waitstaff was very pleasant  My carnitas torta was fresh off the grill, flavorful and prepped with care. A good portion of avocado and a little jalapeno for kick.  Music was maybe a bit too loud but that's just a nit pick.</text></record></dataset><record>

Don't get me wrong the red salsa is amazing and the food is really good but it seems like every time I go there the cheese is not melted in the bean and cheese burritos. I understand they might be in a rush to get orders in but I hate coming home and having to microwave my burrito for the cheese to melt. My daughter got a bean and cheese also and her cheese wasn't even melted either but there have been lots of time also where they did actually melt the cheese and the bean and cheese burrito would taste amazing. We would always do a phone order and we always would tell them to please make sure the cheese was melted but for some reason they don't follow what we want.< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None</response>< GmapID>

Super authentic Mexican food. Delicious. I'm very picky when it comes to mexican food and I've tried the chicken taquitos, green chicken enchiladas, Chile rellenos, asada tacos and they are great. The albondigas and mole are ok . The atmosphere at this location is so inviting. All the staff has great customer service, something that is very hard to come by now a day.<//Text>

That said, their agua frescas are delicious. They come in several flavors and I may very well go back just for a drink.< /Review><user>104336249532327933852<//user></record></dataset><record>

<Text>The food is good but the owner's son is a stuck up punk! I made the mistake of telling him that my chile relleno was a little greasy once and he decided to be petty by telling everyone who left the restaurant goodbye except for me! I haven't been back since.</Text>< Rate>

I don’t want to eat a rubbery tortilla. They also were about to close last time I came and they kindly agreed to make me a burrito to go. Friendly staff and reasonable prices besides a clean restaurant ñ. I recommend them.< /review>< rating>

They are not listed on Door Dash, Uber Eats, Or Postmates and their  phone is out of service. Otherwise, great restaurant. Also, when you type 'Mexican Food' or 'Mexican Restaurants' in maps.google.com, none of the La Tapatia's show up.< /Review>

Heard about this place from a friend and today was my first time trying it. I ordered the family pack of 4 wet burritos and omg AMAZING I loved the beans and rice that came with each plate. And the horchata was perfect. I'll definitely be going back. 5 stars!</text>

This is one of the only places that sells pretty good pozole on the weekends. They sometimes run out. The rest of the menu is ok, considering the area does not have many good choices. On our last visit, we had the carne asada burrito covered in enchilada sauce, and the green chile burrito (pork/green chile) filling. Can't go wrong with their micheladas.</text>

I would gladly say this place gave me a great experience! The food is so delicious with flavor. The area is very clean and organized. There are enough waiters to keep up with the orders. I enjoyed the music and atmosphere and notice it gets busy at times . I did see happy customers in and out . The prices are reasonable for the incredible menu. I like the way i was treated by the employees and the manager. I felt like they cared about my first time there and made sure i had everything i needed.<//text>

Can't go wrong with a family owned, walk up and order, homemade Mexican food restaurant. Convenient and fast but with a warm and welcoming atmosphere. My daughter and I found La Tapatia on online review, this place is delicious! The chicken Molé enchiladas were so good! Molé is on the sweet side but barely, I really loved the generous amount of chicken enveloped inside the corn tortilla. If you're looking for hot and I do mean en fuego salsa this is the spot! Burns sooo good!<//review>

This place man hit the spot. You guys are better than El Torito's better than Roberto's of Las Vegas.  And the hot beans in the pot was delicious.  We took 2 of the business cards with us, so we know where to come back to when we leave Las Vegas or L. A.. Their attention and service was AMAZING.</text>

<Text>Sadly, my 5 star review is now 1. My husband and I used to go to this place every week. We had to stop after receiving meat with Brillo pad in it. This was pretty horrifiying as I am pregnant. After months of craving these tacos we had our co worker pick us up some at lunch. We got only part of our order and it was given with no condiments. We will NEVER be back here again. Very very sad their attention to detail has gone completely out the window.< /Text>< username>

<Review>I don't care for the service or how this place is run, which is a shame because the food is actually good. But once you have bad management, it doesn't matter how good the food is, I will never give another penny to you. I once ordered tacos here and 1 of the tacos was the wrong meat. I called and they said that they would replace only that one taco. Well, I don't live exactly down the street, so to drive all the way back over 30 minutes for that 1 taco would be a waste. I told whoever I was talking to this and his response was well it was just that taco not the whole thing. What they should of done was to replace the whole plate for the inconvenience, which would have kept me as a customer for life, but no. Also, the young man who helped me, he has terrible crater acne scars on his cheeks, I later learned was the owner's son, which made A LOT of sense. He had a smart alec attitude about himself. He never smiled or seemed like he cared to be there. He just had a BAD vibe about himself. I also didn't appreciate how he told every other customer who left goodbye instead of me. Oh well, you won't be seeing me again.<//Review><rating>1<//rating>< user_id>

I have worked near this place a little over 2 years now and never visited. Good thing I decided to visit cause the food and drinks are delicious here. The Horchata is probably the best thing that stands out for me but the burrito and torta are absolutely delicious. It's well worth paying a visit to.< /Text>

We were in our RV and stopped to do laundry. We saw this little place and thought it may be pretty good with all the people there. We were so right! This is a GREAT little restaurant. We ordered at the counter and it didn’t take long for our food to be delivered. Everything was VERY good and the staff was extremely friendly and eager to serve. We would gladly eat here again. This place is a must come to if your in a 20 mile radius best customer serive beans tacos and burritos come threw< /review>

<Text>They have daily specials. I especially like their chicken tortas, chili rellenos and cheese enchiladas. The green salsa is my favorite out of the salsas offered and I also like that they offer complimentary beans. If you like lots of drink choices they have one of those coke freestyle machines.< /Text>< gmap_id>

I would leave negative stars if I could! I walked in, something very rude was said a about me I'm Spanish with the manager and three workers at the register. They proceeded to ignore me for a good 15-20 seconds. Which doesn't sound like that long, but I was literally looking at them all awaiting someone to take my order.  I walked out and I will never return.  Shameful.<//review>

<Review>I been to this place a lot. Really good food (especially the tacos) and it is pretty clean. But today will be the last time we eat here. The girl with the tattoo on her forearm was really rude to my wife and I and wouldn’t let us look over the menu. She rushed us and gave us attitude the whole time. Really disrespectful. Thought it was a family owned restaurant that would show more respect and be more welcoming.</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

You know how Mexican restaurants usually have one meat that they do exceptionally well? Here, its CARNITAS! They do carnitas, homemade salsas, and beans that leave your mouth watering for more. Family favorite for taco Tuesdays. No good specials on Tuesdays (just small fried tacos. But Fridays they have a special on carnitas tacos.< /Text>

What a place! Good atmosphere awesome food. The tacos are bomb. The torta was great. Plain and simple menu. Reasonable prices nothing to break the wallet. The aguas frescas hit the spot this sunny day. And the bean soup is out of this world. Overall dinner with my father at La Tapatia is going to be pleasant and memorable moment for a long time. Well deserved 5 stars.< /review>

Finally!
The best Mexican restaurant in town!
Authentic Mexican food for reasonable prices.
Fantastic chili rellenos and the best refried beans I've ever had!
My personal favorite is their carnitas burritos...wet.
You won't be disappointed!< /Review>

Great food and service. Fluent in English and Spanish. Girls at the counter are really friendly. I had been craving pozole for a while and their pozole really hit the spot. Authentic flavors, with a clean, modern setting. They have a good selection of authentic dishes and also offer burgers and a kids menu.< /Text>

Best Enchilada combo plate in the Inland Empire. Best wet burrito in the Inland Empire. And arguably one of the best customer service establishments in the IE. Plus they have one of those fancy soda machines with every drink under the sun.< /text>

Fantastic. Just found this place through word of mouth... I see why. LOVE the food. I am on a keto diet so its nice to have options available. Their mexican caesar salad is so damn good, there was tons of chicken on that bad boy...add avocado... (I get no tortilla strips) I'll be coming back as long as they are consistent. So far so good!< /text>

The food was really great and the prices dont make sense. Extremely affordable for the quantity of food. Two TV's showing Monday night football. The drink dispenser is a coca cola flavor mix machine. Definitely will keep coming back!< /review>

<review>This is a great place to come to if you want authentic south of the border food (Mexican). They have tortas, burritos, albóndigas, huevos rancheros, enchiladas and they even have "frijoles de la olla" (whole beans) at the salsa bar, while you wait.

Recently I ordered the carne asada torta. The bread was fresh, the beans were tasty, and the avocado was delicious. Not to mention the salsa is always on point. They have mild, medium or hot. My wife ordered the chilaquiles. She got a massive plate full of them. We probably could have shared that one plate, but I only wanted to try a little. The chilaquiles had a delicious home-made taste to them.

I'm glad my family and I discovered this place. We have brought other friends and family and they love it too. Looking forward to my next visit.<//review></record></dataset><record>

The best of the Mexican food options on Cherry Avenue between the 210 and the 10. If you had Miguel Jr's down the street, I would recommend La Tapatia. It is better food for more reasonable prices.<//text>

<text>All hype food is decent not authentic very rude if you don't know any better then I guess it's great food but the reality is this particular location is unwelcoming to those that don't speak Spanish to there liking I put in a order and the guy new what I was talking about but of course dummied up and pretended not to understand me really!

<review>The place was clean but small for the time we went around 7pm. The dinner rush made it hard to find a place to sit. I ordered the carne asada burrito it was ok seems to miss the authentic Mexican flavor that I was expecting from this place. The service was great and the order came out quickly.<//review><username>TRACKGODZ RACING<//username>< rating>

<Review>Unauthentic and low quality. I ordered 2 asada tacos and a shrimp cocktail. The asada is not asada folks! It's like a chuck or something but definitely not asada. It was all nerves and grissel fat. Waka..They should just call it a beef taco. Next the shrimp cocktail. 10.99 for about five shrimp in a cup of water. No flavoring in the cocktail and barely any veggies. Only a few slivers of avacado and tiny bit of tomato and cilantro. If you're a real latino then you are probably very depressed right now. Pura agua, nada de limon o salsita, nada. Miserable lugar. I will not be coming back. I'm going straight to weinersnitzel across from here, I'm starving.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

<review>I love this place, the burritos are delicious and they have horchata and other good drinks. Serves alcohol for those that are thirsty and tacos are reasonably priced and tasty.</review>< pictures>

<Review>Not your "classic" Mexican place.
Fresh, tasty,  and healthy. Throw a dart to order. They it all. Always one special Agua Fresca along with the standards.
Do Not Miss the BEANS. On the salsa table.< /Review>< Pictures>

<Review>Clean, delicious and authentic Mexican food. Small but clean friendly place. Have never been disappointed. I have tried the chimichangas   rolled taquitos, pozole, menudo and al pastor tacos which i have never liked anywhere but here. The salsa bar has something for everyone. I like the hottest salsa (red and super smooth). It tastes delicious with their complimentary charro beans...best I ever had. And absolutely affordable, but the food tastes so good I would definitely pay more if I had to< /Review>< Rating>

They DONT use Chicken stock in there rice or LARD In there beans so they are VEGAN friendly ")) just make sure u LET them know a couple times because they still aren't used to not adding cheese to every dish .. but our family has been coming for 3 years and only had that happen 3 times our of ALL of our visits .. not to bad 🤷🏽‍♀️< /Text>

This place is phenomenal! I can't believe it took me so long to try them out. They're food is authentic & so delicious. Highly recommend the Chile rellenos, flautas, nachos, machaca burrito, Asade burrito (both wet) & the menudo. The staff is very friendly & helpful & the restaurant itself is kept very clean all the time. Very good spot for outstanding food. Please try you will not be disappointed!< /Text>

I have been in this placed a few times, until now I can say I'm done and will not come back, my son ordered chilaquiles with the sauce on the side (he likes to add the salsa so they are crispy)  and they serve him a plate of dry chips from a bag, we complained and the manager has the audacity to say "we created a way to do chilaquiles really fast and still charge a real meal price", did not offer to give our money back or even substitute the disgusting plate of "food".
This place does not deserve any stars on my review, I added one otherwise I couldn't post.<//Text>

Quick service usually. Hard shell tacos were ok, small amount of meat or filling such as potato. Seems like the chile verde pork burrito was popular in reviews so I decided to try it. Really good. Some of the best I've had.<//text>
