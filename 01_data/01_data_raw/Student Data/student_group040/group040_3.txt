<review>Found this family owned propane business near my area. With the COVID restrictions this past year and the on and off bans on dinning at restaurants, we’ve been doing more home grilling and camping and consuming more propane.

Recently bought a 5lb tank for camping use and brought it here for the first fill. Had no issues for the fill (1.2 gallon) and Nona was super funny and informative - she explained how to see the manufacture date of tanks and mine was just made a couple of months ago(tanks can only be used for 12 years before they need to be re-certified).

Wessel charges by the gallon for the refills. A 20lb tank will typically have 4.6 gallons capacity. In January of 2021, they charge $3.05 per gallon (plus tax) which is roughly around $14 for a 20lb tank. This is cheaper then other refill places I know of and much cheaper then tank exchanges. For tank exchanges, they normally come with 80% fill.

I would highly recommend this place for your next propane tank refill.</review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN1i7NJFBl5zasACmhm370Z42Lu0QzbDr4KM4MH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMezC1hm6jWnZsCustDVjQp7SxdcY8Pwibic8lN=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNXQNYlAUd-XjxOehjZW01JKmSah19S2iRjcqj3=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMwOyKGvUESl_s5SV3iMR4SdsxI9igNJqWoq-Lf=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNcz8GfO0KHpXN5Y32SwS7_V2zaAtG9K3u5TBHb=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMe3OPLzZDaknp2bPhltumH5DGti_jHzqpiXjWW=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures><response>None<//response><gmapID>0x80c2d7a74fdd3a41:0x900743ef68002719< /gmapID></record>

<Review>I don't usually write reviews, but after been to this place, I think Wessel Propane Inc. deserves a positive review, I've been around and refill propane, I'd say best price in 20 miles radius near the area.  I got ripped off before, and I brought the tank I bought for refill, it's 3.05 per gallon , all other places charge at least $4+.  Even told me to go amazon to get empty tank if I don't wanna over paid. Family owned, support local business!</Review><GmapID>0x80c2d7a74fdd3a41:0x900743ef68002719<//GmapID>< rate>

<Text>It was refreshing to experience such exceptional customer service at Wessel Propane. I had previously heard glowing reviews from family/friends and had to check it out for myself, even driving in from the San Fernando Valley. I was most definitely not disappointed. The owner is so passionate about what she does, cares enough to educate me about my tanks, and is so very personable. On top of all that, all COVID-19 precautions were taken. I highly recommend and will be coming again.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

So I didn’t know you could refil your propane tanks! This place is old school and a little intimidating but at the end of the day we’re all here to help each other out. Super helpful and I’m never going back to Home Depot to switch out my tanks. Check it out!< /text>

I’ve been going to here, (Wessle Propane) for 5 years now, for the company I work for. And every time I’m greeted by Nona who’s always been so helpful and nice. She always makes me smile. I want everyone to know this is a reliable place to get your propane, and the customer service you receive from her is top notch!!</review>

<review>I come to Wessel everytime I need to refill my propane tanks. I mainly use propane for cooking, BBQ, and outdoor heaters.

Everytime I come here, I always get great service. That's what keeps me coming back.

I live not too far, but if I did live farther away I would probably still go out of my way to come here for my propane needs.

The prices are great. I'm always delighted with how inexpensive it is to fill my tanks. This is a family owned business, and they are great people.

They provide services thats always above and beyond what you get at U-Haul, or any other of these propane place.

I'm probably going to be a life time customer, as long as they are around! If you check them out, if your able to, its always nice to give a tip to whomever helps you.

They don't ask for it, or even impy it or anything like that, but COVID is hurting small businesses right now. I would do anything I can to help these places stay around as long as possible.</review>< pictures>

<Text>I am a happy customer of Wessel Propane. I have been going there for years. If I run out of propane and they are closed, I just don't go anywhere else, I wait. I always receive quick service with a smile and good prices, even discounts for teachers. One time, I had a propane tank that was expired and they didn't fill it. Of course I was a little bothered at first, but it's totally understandable, SAFETY FIRST! I was given information on how to solve my expired tank issue and I got it replaced, no problem!!   Let's support this family run business like they support the community. It is well deserved! 🙂< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

Awesome service, would highly recommend heading to this location for any propane needs. It’s businesses as these that truly keep America rolling as they also provide services to commercial and regular consumers. Pricing alone make this place a “go to” location but the professional service they provide is what makes me a repeat customer. Thank you guys!< /Review>

<review>I had two days of propane in my tank and my current propane supplier wouldn't fill my tank for one week. I called Wessel, they filled my tank the next day. When the driver was thru, he handed me the bill and didn't require a check, he gave me an instant open account with net 10 day terms. I then asked him if he fills 25 gallon bar-b-que tanks. He said bring it over, and filled for free.  Of course I dumped my old supplier and Wessel is now getting my business. They're an awesome company!

This is a hidden gem for propane.  The customer service is always great, they are friendly and polite.  The price to fill a tank is also cheaper than at most places.  This is my go to place.< /Review>

We were staying at Welks Resort and The Market delivered delicious (and HOT) pizza and some sandwiches right to our room. We ordered over the phone and they were super friendly and helpful, hoping to someday come back and actually go in the shop because from the pictures it looks very cute!<//Review>

Great little deli! Alex (the owner) is a very nice guy and super helpful. Every sandwich I've had there was fresh, filling, and flavorful. They have a great little coffee bar in there are well. Tables and chairs are outside to sit and relax as well.< /Text>

I eat a lot of sushi and I happen to run across this restaurant today and because it has a high rating, I decided to try it. Boy, am I glad that we stopped. The food was spectacular. This is the freshest fish that I've had in a long time. Every component of what we ordered was top notch.

I had a Ruby Roll which was so tasty and large. It's basically a big California roll with spicy crab on top. That could have been my whole meal but being the glutton that I am I also ordered another roll. Unfortunately I can't remember the name of it but it too was very tasty.

My daughter ordered the chirashi dinner which included a salad and soup. The miso soup was good and the salad with the ginger dressing was really good. My daughter let me taste the sashimi on her meal and it was so fresh, it melted in your mouth.

This will become my favorite sushi restaurant. You should make it yours too!< /Text>

<Text>Their yakitori if flavorful but they didn't provide any dipping sauce.  My son ordered an udon noodle that comes with tempura, and again, they didn't provide any tempura dipping sauce.  I ordered a sea scallop cut roll, and it's literally a few pieces of sea scallops put on top of a California roll.  It was rather disappointing.   The service was good.  But it's just not worth the price.< /Text>< pics>

We ordered the omakase sashimi platter and spicy edamame with the chicken thigh and pork belly yakitori. The service was extremely friendly and quick, but the sashimi was sadly disappointing. The slices provided lacked flavor. The scallops and fresh octopus were the best items on the plate, but the rest was just... boring. I really wanted to love this place.

The chicken thigh was good, but the sauce was too sweet. The pork belly was over-cooked and very tough to chew.

Honestly, the stars are more for the service than the flavor of food.< /text>

Fresh and delicious sushi - see photos. Ask the chef if you have anything in particular you'd like to order and he will get it for you. Dont know what to order, omakase is all you need to say - 9 pcs of nigiris, a roll, and soup - all for $31.00.< /review>

I adore this place! They give sensational meals, their menu is large, The chef in that spot is a specialist, I love very much eating all their dishes. The food is consistently of high class, the service towards the customers  is efficient. I often go to  this restaurant and I not even once was unsatisfied. I recommend it with no hesitation.<//review>

<Review>Alternative place when me and the gf aren't down to wait so long at Sugarfish. This place serves handrolls and salmon sashimi only so this is the SPOT to go if you're craving sugarfish's handrolls but don't want to wait so long there! All handrolls are rolled up fresh in front of you. Be sure to eat it fast before the seaweed gets soggy. My favorite is the blue crab roll and scallop roll. The lobster roll is okay but I'd rather get another blue crab roll :).<//Review><GmapID>0x80dcd74bcc96c973:0xefca89f64fb12b5a< /GmapID>< Resp>

My favorite sushi lunch spot. The line starts forming before 11, so you have to rush there to get first seating. Their Sashimi Lunch special is the best!!! Must try gem in Little Tokyo. They also let you get the lunch special to go, in case there are no seats.<//Text>

Friendly staff came for dinner pretty fresh nigiri ordered the shrimp nigiri, tomato nigiri, both tasted sweet. The tamago tasted more like a dessert, I had a seaweed salad it was delicious a good amount for sharing. It was an overall good experience, love the set up of the resturant it makes you feel relaxed cant wait to come back and try more items on the menu.< /text>

Omakase is supreme! My wife and I have been coming to this delightful place since we moved to the OC two years ago. Excellent service and no wait time. Please keep in mind we come at 5pm sharply.

The fish here is fresh and delectable. Most of all items here we've tried were prepared on the spot served. You cannot go wrong with the affordability for sashimi here.

5 stars.</text>

The very best sushi/sashimi we’ve eaten in many years.  The yuzu ponzu offerings are outstanding.  The seafood is melt-in-your-mouth fresh, tender and subtlety flavorful.  We will be returning to enjoy many more entrees.  This is the sort of place you return to again and again and never grow tired of (even if you order the same thing again and again), but you’ll be wise to try something new each visit.  I’m leaving this review knowing I may be making their waitlist looooong and may be inconveniencing myself whenever I’m hungry for sushi/sashimi, but you mustn’t miss this place!  Try them out!  You won’t be disappointed.<//review>

<date>1483166441169< /date><rating>5< /rating><review>I have never imaged being able to enjoy Authentic, real Japanese food here in California until I discovered Kaigen.

I ordered some Suzuki (sea-bass) & Tai (red Snapper) and it seriously reminded me of sushi in Japan. The chef informed me that the fishes come fresh, many from Japan. Best Toro I have had. The flavoring of the sushi/sashimi's are perfect. You definitely taste the difference compared to all the frozen fishes we are used to eating in Cali.

Ordered some menu items and was really satisfied with them all.

If you want authentic, delicious Japanese food, you have to check this place out.

On top of that, Service was on point.</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

I go here for lunch since it's walking distance from a client's office. The sit-down lunch special is amazing value for $6.50.  You get Miso soup, salad, chicken teriyaki, gyoza, rice, and 4 California rolls.</text>

<Text>Takaraya! I think I spelled the name right. Let's take a trip to Japan. Simple food without the fancy decoration and price. I like this place because it's never really that busy. The food quality is okay. I think the sushi is better than the entree items. I tried the Chicken katsu curry The chicken was tender but a bit small for 7 dollars, about the size of my palm. It came with a huge plate of rice and curry on the side, which I liked. The curry was a little different that the Japanese curry I'm use too. It tasted more like Chinese curry that you get from 99 Ranch. The spice tuna was not too bad. The eel could have been better. Overall, it isn't Mitusuwa market quality, but will satisfy your craving for sushi the same way McDonalds will satisfy a burger craving. It's not bad, but it may leave you wanting more. I haven't tried the ramen and hope to try it next time.

Recommended to try. I'm always a fan of sushi without the crowds and the super expensive price tags.</Text>< Pics>

This place is excellent. A nice hidden gem you may have passed without even realizing. The food was very fresh and very delicious. The asada tacos were tender and had a great flavor. The fish tacos were amazing, full of flavor, yet not heavy at all. Staff was very polite and speedy with service. A great restaurant that one should not pass up.< /text>

I have family in Sinaloa and often travel to Los Mochis to visit, food is an important part of their culture and their daily lives. Its always fantastic and just the best. I miss it often when I'm not with family and am always in the look out for amazing Mexican food.

When I saw the sign for Sinaloa Fish Market and Restaurant I knew I had to try it.

Walking in, the place clean and has a friendly environment.

We ordered a few small things to try; Fish Taco, Shrimp Taco, Asada Taco and a Shrimp and Octopus Tostada.

They are all on point and fantastic! The salsa was the perfect amount of heat with a great flavor. I cannot wait to come back and try more!!

The place was also pretty empty, I encourage you to try this place out, they are amazing!! Please let's help this local business thrive!!!< /review></record></dataset><record>

<review>(Translated by Google) Tacos la Carreta
The food is passable, the service terrible, 20 minutes and never got to take the order, the floor all dirty, the waitresses talking, instead of attending the People or clean. Not recommendable.

< review>
St. Columban is my hometown Church where I grew up going for over 30 years. Even if I moved I still come back and attend mass when i can on the weekends or special holidays mass. I come to Duc Me La Vang to pray and our family is blessed. I take my kids here to pray all the time. There is a new restroom and the church is always super clean.< /review>

This is one of the most visually stunning churches I've ever been to. From the altar to the statues, everything was thoughtfully chosen. I used to come here in my youth and always loved the friendly community. Now, I only go when I'm back in town visiting my parents. The improvements they've made over the years are impressive. For example, the projectors help display song lyrics and the correct prayer wordings.  It seems that the community is stronger and friendlier than ever:)</text>

I mean. Don't know what to say about this place tbh. But I've been going here with my parents for 14 years ever since I moved here with my mom to the US to be with my dad after. I came here when I was 9 years old. Now I'm 23. Time flew by fast and this church may not be much, but its enough for me to remember all the years of praying and going to communion. I STILL havent drank their wine tho lmao. Let me know how that taste.</Text>

I grew up being a parishioner here since I was a child and I love the beautiful church but I am sad to say that the staff on the other hand is not very nice at all. she was rude disrespectful and very picky about everything. I called in for a baptism for my child and Rachel who I spoke over the phone, told me I have to come into the office. After a lengthy process and explanation from Rachel and making sure everything was right Rachel told me she does not handle Vietnamese baptism and to come back during the weekend to turn in my paperwork. i took time off of work to stop by and made sure to be able to see her so she can help me. I return 2 days later and she refused to take in my paperwork and told me I had to talk to the weekend receptionist. She gave me an attitude and went to help someone else and ignored me so I just decided to go to another church. saint columban church need new better staff. I do not think I will ever come back again. It is very disheartening. How can you work at a church and have that attitude...?< /Text>

<Text>My mom came into the office asking about having a baptism appointment for one of our relatives. She ask for a translator for detail but Rachael insist on helping, refusing to find my mom a translator. There was time during their conversation Rachael kept rolling her eyes and get super frustrated by my mom’s accent. Why get mad? She refuse to find a translator and decided to pour her frustration on my mom. That’s just rude.

Church overall was very nice though love it.< /Text><name>Lazyo Oops</name>< date>

I love St Columbans Church, Father Joe is Great. His explanations of the readings and homily are a learning experience. I  understand him, alot of the time I have difficulty understanding the other priest. I was planning to leave this church, but will hold off till he leaves.</Text>

Went for confession on a Saturday morning.  Confessions are 9-10 am. Was told to go about 9:20 to avoid the lines. Greeter there was friendly and directed me to where we needed to go. There were only three confessionals left by 9:20, but no Spanish speakers. I called the Rectory while I was still there, left a message with secretary for a call back for appointment. Never received a call back. Disappointed.< /Review>

<Text>I called the church for information on a mass for my daughthers quinceañera XV and a church rep told us that the mass cost is $1350.00 Really???
What Jesus said to people who were is his temple selling stuff you are making my home a place for ......
This is a reason for people step away from this church.
Ultimately don't need the church as long you behave well, help and respect others and pray every day.< /Text>< pictures>

<text>I purchased my SC60 T5 and immediately discovered there were 2 recalls. I called Volvo Cars Ontario and was able to bring it in the next day. I was initially told that the parts for 1 recall were available, but had to wait about 30 days for the second one. Augie Gonzalez moved mountains and took care of BOTH recalls that day! He also arranged a ride home for me. Amazing customer service.  I highly recommend Volvo Cars Ontario.<//text><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

<rate>1</rate><review>Super disappointed.  I showed up today with my fiancé to buy two XC40’s (electric cars).   We knew exactly what they had in stock and they were what we wanted.  I know we showed up late (45 minutes till closing) but we would have been in and out.  We were told it was too late and to show up another day.  My credit is decent (760) had 30k down for both, and I make 200k plus per year.   Disappointed.</review>< pics>

<date>1619481513059</date><Rating>1</Rating><review>Volvos are great cars, my experience at this dealership was anything but. My wife and I were in the area and have been wanting to test drive some Volvos to cross shop the Audi Q3 that was at the top of her list for the new car shes planning on buying in a couple months.  The salesperson who greeted us asked if we had an appointment, we said no and told him we were interested in test driving an S60 and XC40. He didn't really ask any questions or make any conversation other than that. He then went inside and came back out to tell us his manager said we could only test drive 1 car. We've been to close to 10 dealerships in the past month and a half test driving anything and everything she was interested in, finally settling on the Q3 as her top pick. We have never been told there was a limit on test drives at other dealerships. He walked us to the S60, opened the trunk without saying a word, after about 30 seconds he said "I'll ride in the back" and we were off. On the drive he offered no details about the car, about the only thing he suggested was to turn down the radio so we could hear the road noise. He did say something about one of the sales people having "the virus" and continued to blame the sales manager after I said it was ridiculous we could only test drive 1 car. It was also weird the salesperson didn't ask for any ID or proof of insurance before the drive and after we we said we weren't interested in the S60 didn't ask for any contact info or anything else really. Guess they really don't care about customer service or selling cars. After the horrible experience here we went down the street to the VW dealership and  test drove, wait for it, TWO cars OMG. We liked the Tiguan and LOVED the ID.4 we test drove there, the sales people were great too. We'll probably be placing an order for the ID.4 in the next couple months, though we're interested in checking out the Ionic 5 and the Aria when they're available as well.< /review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

We own a C70 Volvo that we bought new from Ontario Volvo in 2010.  Other than a few oil changes and some tires, we have had all our service done at Ontario Volvo.  Recently, our AC stopped blowing cold air and we did not think twice about having Ontario Volvo and their Service team do the evaluation and repairs.  Ivan is very professional and understands the Gold Standard of Service Delivery.  He kept us up to date and informed about our issue.  The repair was done in the time stated and we headed in to pick up our vehicle.  We realized that the air was not blowing cold.  Ivan helped us test it and they quickly evaluated the issue and offered to correct it immediately.  The next day Ivan informed us of the issue and that it was corrected.  They also offered to make it right to our satisfaction.  Thank you Ivan, thank you Volvo of Ontario.  While we do not want to see you soon, we are more than comfortable that you will handle any of our concerns.< /text>

From the initial enquiry to financing to the personal delivery of our new Volvo, Michael Flaherty was a joy to work with. Professional, knowledgable, accommodating, without any pressure - just responsive to our needs throughout the process. It was the best car-buying experience I've had in my 30+ years of buying vehicles; total joy. If we buy another Volvo downstream, it'll be Michael we call first... this review was not solicited (figured I better say that, since it seems impossible it'd be that 'easy' to buy a car)<//Text>

<text>Ok do Volvo is a luxury car yet the dealership is like being at a Toyota car lot sad They don’t give no longer cars while your car is being serviced so you have to sit and wait there’s not a lot of Volvo dealership so you don’t have much to choose from in my area service department man juan very rude Sounds man and manager would not be much of any upgrades anything in a luxury car which is kind of unheard no one has offered us anything we can sit here over an hour and a coffee machine not luxury at all as far as the dealership and customer service calls nice clothes this is very disappointing<//text>< Rate>

< Review>
Great experience, my wife and I purchased a used Audi a few weeks back and we could not be more pleased with the service! Michael was wonderful and the whole experience actually enjoyable! The whole staff was professional and very nice, highly recommend going here to purchase your next vehicle!
They even helped get a few small dents out of the car before we took it home!

The only problem we had was after they gave us the keys and we drove off we realized they didn’t fill up the car with gas... we are chalking it up to an honest mistake but other than that, the process was terrific!</Review>

<Review>Augie Gonzales and Juan Aranda, are just 2 clowns. I went to this location a so many times with my Electric Volvo that will not charge. They ran so many tests, and keep me waiting for so long and could never fix the charging problem. I spent hours talking to corporate and called back Volvo Ontario, so many times, which they never returns any of my calls.
Eventually, I bought a new charger on Amazon for $150, that solves the issue. I kept telling Augie Gonzales and Juan Aranda the whole time, it might the charger, but they would not listen to me. This place is not professional with a bunch of amateurs working there. Absolutely waste of time!< /Review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

Called the Ontario Volvo dealer to ask for their assistance with setting up the Volvo On Call service on my new car. And although I didn’t purchase the car at their dealership, Michael Flaherty was courteous and friendly and helped me with activating a courtesy membership at no charge! Thank you so much Michael!</Text>

<Review>JUAN ARANDA in the service dept. treated my boyfriend and I like complete garbage. He literally never returned our call, we gave him 4 days. Finally we had to call and demand to talk to someone else instead of leaving more messages for the ever absent Juan. We asked for several things to be fixed and in the course of 12 whole days the only thing that got fixed was the fuel pump. He never even mentioned the other things we asked for when we showed up for our car. We are more than happy to take our business elsewhere for the additional repairs. I am going to do my utmost to ensure nobody makes the mistake of taking their car here for service. I don’t usually post negative reviews, but I feel especially disrespected and I’d hate for it to happen to you too.<//Review><user>115142178374479048662< /user><pictures>None</pictures><Date>1593058634946< /Date></record>

Brought my car in for service.  You expect the dealer to be expensive, and they are.  Did not expect the complete lack of honesty and integrity to get the final bill hundreds of dollars over what they estimated.  I feel financially abused and they so  condescendingly suggest I would flake on hundreds of dollars.  The difference is over $800 folks.  It would have been a tipping scale decision point for doing the work.  Just picked my vehicle up it up today so can't speak to the quality of work yet but I did receive a low tire pressure alert within 10 miles of driving away.  An oil change was part of the work so that doesn't speak well for the quality either.  Checking tire pressure is SOP with an oil change but apparently not for their Volvo Ontario dealership.  I never go off like this.  It just feels so abusive that you need to warned before you get service there.  Especially if you are female.  Demand the estimate in writing because they have no problem financially abusing their customers.<//Text>

<Text>I went for a recall and an oil change two days ago, so I took the day off work. I was told my car would be ready the same day by Juan, an employee. I was okay with it until I got a call back saying only the recall repair was made because he "forgot" about my oil change. What type of business is this that they forget to do their job? He wasn't even sorry when he said it. I declined his offer to wait longer for an oil change since my job is also essential and his mistake costed my a day off already. This is very unprofessional and unsatisfactory</Text><Pics>None<//Pics><rating>1<//rating></record>

<Rating>5</Rating><Text>I live in Indiana and purchased a 2012 xc 70 in California. It was exactly the color and condition we had been shopping for. Our salesperson’s name was Jamie and she was exceptionally accommodating in dealing with an out of state sale. She was prompt and helpful in providing fast photo’s and specific shots I had requested. She represented the vehicles condition for precisely what it was. The documents arrived and we paid for the car. Jamie is very honest and I can not say enough about her customer service at such a distance. If you are near Ontario California Volvo or 2000 miles away rest assured that I found that Jamie and this dealership are above board. And usually that level of integrity in business flows from the top through its trained and qualified staff and to you the prospective buyer. Give them a call and ask for Jamie and shop with confidence.

< Review>
Dishonest service department. I know that dealers need to survive on service revenue, but this experience is blatantly bad.

I went in for a regular 75,000 mile maintenance for $475 and decided to get my brake pads replaced for additional $600, but ended up with a bill for $1,450. When I got the service document, it stated that I had complained about noise in the water pump (which I did not; the agent said THEY discovered some issue) and they had to  replace it (under the 100k powertrain warranty purchased when I bought the car), along with air breather. The simple brake pad replacement ended up with additional rotor replacement on the rear (which I do not understand why as the brakes were performing normal). The vehicle had no problem previously as I am very familiar with vehicle mechanics (I work in auto industry). It was obvious that they were taking advantage of the Volvo system to siphon money from Volvo as well.
When I picked up my car, there was no explanation of what was performed and why. It seemed obvious that the agent did not want to go over the paper in detail.

Overall, bad experience and bad taste in my mouth. I will not go back, and I plan to inform Volvo America for this dishonest behavior.</Review>

I had a car delivered out of state from this dealership and the person that I had spoken with over the phone didn't provide details on how to activate features on the car and only occasionally returned calls.  Later, I was  put in contact with Michael Flaherty who had excellent follow up and quickly helped get the vehicle set up - 5 stars for Michael.< /review>

I can honestly say that this was a great car-buying experience! We never felt pressured or rushed, which is a first for me at any dealership. Michael Flaherty, our salesman, was an absolute gentleman. He was also fun, genuine, and knowledgeable.
This is our first Volvo, and 2 days after buying Certified pre-owned, we have ZERO buyer's remorse. Our SUV is brand new, as far as I can tell, and we love it! Shaun Ridge also did an excellent job getting us a good interest rate and finalizing all the signing quickly but comfortably.
Thanks again, Mike and Shaun!<//review>

This was our first ever experience inside a Volvo dealership.  I was pleasantly surprised.  The lobby was modern and the chairs were amazingly comfortable.  The atmosphere was quiet and relaxed.  Water and snacks were offered.
Well, enough of that, let me get on to the actual car buying process.  Our sales manager was Tony Achkarian and I can guarantee you will not find a better representative.  He was very professional, genuine, patient and a knowledgeable car guy.
We initially came for a particular car but after the walk-around and test drive, we weren't thrilled with the options.  Tony was very understanding and another car caught our eye the moment we walked onto the lot, so he was more than happy to show us that one.  We ended up leaving with the better equipped car.
Throughout the process, Tony was very supportive and went above and beyond to try and meet our requests.  Even after having the car at home, late in the evening, and realizing the Carfax wasn't included with our paperwork, it was Tony to the rescue with great promptness and follow-through.
Can't say enough about our great experience and it was a pleasure working with Tony.< /Review>

If you're going to purchase a car - start here, you won't be disappointed. Hands down the best experience in car shopping so far with Michael Flaherty - not only is the customer service exceptional but they have a no-pressure sales pitch. Nobody wants to deal with dealerships and their games, but this dealer is different - they don't BS, they come with their best foot forward and Michael really goes out of his way to make sure your questions are answered and needs are met. He made it easy for a busy working individual with ability to email, text, and call - he even let me test drive it 3 times because I was undecided and drove about 7 other SUV's. When I wanted to think it over, he was more than happy about that and sent me a follow up text to just let me know he's there if I have questions. Zero pressure, 100% support in the shopping process. Trust me, go here FIRST and I bet you will be completely happy you did!< /Text>

< Review>
I received my 2017 Volvo S60 as a Christmas gift in Dec 2016.  We purchased the best service contract offered at the time.
Every time I scheduled regular maintenance it took days to get through and then days to actually get an appointment.  On my most recent visit I was the first car in for my appointment and was THE last car out ( dropped it off) and I felt like my car and I were an after thought.
On top of the scheduling issues every time I dropped off my car for service, upon pick up my print out never gave me details of recommendations for my car and there were no verbal suggestions... EVER.  I asked this every time I picked it up.   Oh and first dealership that did not rotate tires when doing the oil change as part of the service.  😳
Now to the real fabulous part... my car is now off service contract (50,000) miles, again I took it in for EVERY service recommended, so when I took it in to get new tires at our regular tire place, one  we've been taking our cars for over 15 years you can imagine my surprise when they told me my brakes were metal on metal and needed an alignment really bad. Oh and my tires were wearing on the inside ( coils showing)...keep in mind  I had just done my last service just before the holidays.  The dealership never mentioned I should do breaks soon ... never mentioned I should replace my tires.
I love my Volvo but the fact that this is the only service department in the Inland Empire I will not be buying another vehicle here anytime soon.  Thank goodness we never received a call back from the sales department when we were shopping for a 7 seat cross over and bought a Ford Explorer instead.  I could not imagine dealing with this service department for two cars! One star is one too many.  Most of the staff is nice, I blame the Service Manager who has yet to return my call.
Disappointing.< /Review>

Recently purchased a 2016 XC90 from this dealership.  Exceptional experience all around. The sales team was very eager to meet all my expectations and then some.  I feel that they have gone above and beyond to make sure that I was happy with my purchase and understood every aspect of my new vehicle.  I definitely believe that I will always be a Volvo owner in the future and intend on returning to Ontario Volvo for any future purchases.  110% satisfied< /review>

When I came to the dealership about a month ago, I came with low expectations of leaving with a new car. I was coming to look at my possibilities, as I've always loved Volvos. They are so classy and safe. The lease on my current car was just about up and I was starting my research to replace it. I had nothing to offer the dealership but my business. Everyone was extremely sweet and nice from the moment we stepped on the lot. They were courteous and didn't laugh me out of the building when I told them my situation and what I was working with. I immediately fell in love with a car. They walked me through all the bells and whistles and I was truly impressed with our salesman's knowledge and all the standard features in my car. They took me seriously and looked at every opportunity they could to make a deal happen. They lived up to their reputation and I was able to purchase my dream car! Everyone treated me with respect throughout the process and I'm beyond happy with my new car. Signing docs went super fast and I didn't feel forced to buy additional products I didn't want or need. I would come back here and recommend everyone come here if you want a fair, respectful car buying experience from a safe, luxury brand. The folks who helped me are below, ask for them by name:

Michael Flaherty - He met me on the lot, took the time to look at cars that may fit my financial situation and give me an estimate of monthly pmts so I could realistically see what I could afford. He explained my situation to a Sales Specialist to hand me over since he had an appt coming in. He regularly checked in to see how I was doing as I waited for the deal to go through and congratulated me on my purchase. He was very sweet.

Ron Ford, Sales/Product Specialist - He was super patient with me, very positive and encouraging throughout the process. He was very thorough explaining everything. He knew so much about the brand and cars and was an absolute joy to work with. He went to bat for me to get the deal closed and helped me pass the time, telling stories and making me laugh. I really felt like I mattered and my purchase made him happy as well. I know that if I have any questions, I can always reach out and he'd help me.

Neil Sorenson, Sales Manager

Jim Carpenter, GM

<text>DO NOT PATRONIZE! I had our Volvo (55K mi.) in for regular scheduled maintenance and the service advisor attempted to up sale us with the most well known up sale tactics (just Google them for yourself). They have attempted the same on previous appointments. The first walk around (without me) was done and I was told the car needed an oil flush (due to build up under oil cap, NOT) and a radiator flush (because the antifreeze "looked" watered down, WHAT?) which I declined.

An hour and a half later I was told the front brakes needed replaced as well as new rotors for $550 and wiper blades (I just replaced the wiper blades). I declined! All of these were really not necessary as well!!! After I submitted a POOR customer satisfaction survey, the manager contacted me and was NOT receptive of my concerns and told me that "any 8 year old could measure the rotors" and they needed replaced. The documentation I received stated the measurement was a "wheel on" visual of the brakes. The manager also had a hard time admitting their service advisors are paid on commission, I had to pin him down with an answer!! I WILL NOT RETURN!</text><Time>1344220138916<//Time><Pictures>None</Pictures><rating>2</rating>< UserId.>

Juan Aranda is the best, most conscientious, service representative I have ever encountered.  My mom is on her third Volvo purchased from Ontario Volvo and Juan and other service people have treated her incredibly well. They quickly and effectively take care of whatever problems we encounter.   I drive an extra 60 miles because I know my car will be will taken care of.<//Review>

<review>Last Saturday, I drove from Tujunga out to Ontario to purchase a used Volvo S60 T5. The team at Volvo Ontario is excellent! They made the purchase and finance process a breeze! I hit a bit of a road block when I discovered that my battery needed replacement less than a week after purchase. Fortunately, I bought the Extended Warranty (highly recommend). When I informed Volvo Ontario of the problem I was facing, they did not waste any time at all. Jason the Service Manager was AWESOME! I could tell that he cared and wanted to help me. He sent one of his crew all the way to my home in Tujunga to deliver and install a brand new battery on the spot. Jeremy, the guy who delivered the battery, was awesome, too! Very knowledgeable and kind. I would do business with Volvo of Ontario again any day. Thanks, guys!<//review>< Pics>

Both times I've been in, I've left paying not 1 penny more then quoted. Tax being the exception to that statement. They've taken care of my requests in an honest and timely manner and asked questions where needed. In both cases, I've dealt with the same service rep and same person servicing my car. And in both cases, any "problems" were brought to my attention by both the tech and the rep.

First time I was in, I'd requested a transmission fluid replacement. They told me it wasn't recommended (by the manual, not them. And the manual told me that before I'd gotten there) and offered to do it anyways, but they'd need more time since it required removing my transmission (sealed unit). I declined due to time. But they told me instead on just doing it and told me it wouldn't cost any more.

The second times problem both had been issues I'd known of. One was a light out sensor, due to an led bulb I'd put in going out. They asked if I wanted to replace both with regulars, as you'd expect they would ask. I didn't feel the need for it. Another issue was my trunk latch broken in. Someone had tried to get in my trunk previously and shoved the latch up. They told me about it and quoted the new part, with and without labor (as I'd told them the first time I was there that I'm willing to work on my own cars).

Overall, this dealership won me over. The Irvine dealership would take nearly 3 hours on a simple oil change, and these guys did an exhaustive service on mine in half the time (I watched and timed it) with flushing my break lines, checking every single fluid, replacing a bad sensor and my oil change. I'll go back for many of my basic services for when I don't have time to just do it.

As to people saying they try to overcharge... You would have had to agree to that in order for them to do that. They must have had a point if you agreed to it.<//review><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None< /Resp><GmapID>0x80c34aa13c6e1e65:0xd3527e12557bd15b</GmapID></record>

I just had the most condescending service experience never! Volvo Corporate needs to do something about this location.

I made an appointment to get the fuel sensor replaced and they only work on this during the week. It is my mistake that I was one hour late and didn’t call ahead of time. I arrived at noon and waited one hour for the technician, Ivan, to speak with me. First, he SCOLDED me for being late as if I am a child. He was angry and told me I have to leave the car overnight or reschedule this appointment because it takes 4-6 hours. I explained I can’t take more time off from work and need a car to go home tonight. Ivan continues to SHOUT, now his voice is even louder, that I was late for my appointment. I told him I don’t want to play this blame game and we need to figure out a plan to get me a rental car or I can stay later. Then the server manager, Jason Lewis, stormed out of his office and joined Ivan’s screaming session. He yelled that I would never be late for a doctor’s appointment. If I were to be late the doctor won’t see me. This was out in their open server office space with other customers and staff around. They both were extremely condescending, angry and loud.  I feel ashamed of their unprofessionalism. When is it ever okay to treat a customer is this manner? I am a 5 feet petite Asian woman. I wonder if I were an 8 feet tall white male, would I receive the same condescending treatment.

We have 3 Volvo cars in my family and I get a new lease every three years. None of us will ever buy another car from this location. I don’t normally spend the time writing reviews but I strongly feel that this issue need to be addressed, so NO ONE will ever be treated with such disrespect.

At the end I was able to get my car back in 3.5 hours at 4:30PM. Why tell me that I need to leave it overnight or reschedule? I drove 27 miles home but the number of mileage until empty didn’t change which makes me question it this was fixed at all.<//Review>

This place is an absolute joke.They only care about making money not helping the customer. I wish I could give them a -1 star rating for their greedy, shady unprofessional business practices. Took my s40 there for a driver side CV axle replacement I had a brand new unit in the truck in its box ready for them to install, first they lied and said it wasn't there and that I should order a factory axle through them, then after I caught them in a lie they tell me they can't get the old one out and the transmission needs to be dropped because you know a 1000 dollar job sounds alot better than a simple 240 dollar axle change like they quoted me in the beginning, long story short don't waste your time with these clowns.</text>

Place is amazing! Staff is amazing! The vehicles? OMG they're gorgeous and drenched with a blanket of outright pure hotness!
Now I've read a few of the bad reviews and I have to say....I didn't experience any of that! I actually felt like that little girl on the movie THE HELP and Viola Davis was telling her..YOU IS KIND..YOU IS SMART..YOU IS IMPORTANT..point is..they had me feeling super warm and special inside.
My salesman Tony was amazing..very knowledgeable..extremely patient with me! The sale transition to a full on bromance. So I went on a few test drives and was extremely impressed! But I couldn't really decide between the XC60 and S90...that was just my first visit! Went back a second time to make sure I was in love.. and turns out..yup, I'm still in love! So I decided on the S90 good lord that vehicle is gorgeous!! So they run the numbers.. and that's when I meet Shaun..when he tells me the numbers I'm like WTF??? Almost choked.. so I tell Shaun..let me think on it. I leave.. but Shaun and I stay in contact..and Shaun keeps working on the numbers....which in turn has Jim working hard on the numbers. Shaun calls me and says OKAY, SO WE DOING THIS?? I'm like ahh MAYBE? he then tells me the numbers I do my best to stay cool on the phone and not let him know I'm thrilled.. so I go back a third and final time..every ounce of cool I had in my body left the instant I got on the Volvo grounds..BECAUSE I WOULD BE LEAVING WITH A S90!!! I couldn't believe I was so happy.. my experience was epic.  So before I leave..Michael..which I nickname TITUS...super cool guy!! He shows me how to program the car and Volvo car app.. whew! Sorry if my grammar is off on this review...but seriously, do I care? NOPE..BECAUSE I OWN A VOLVO S90! SHOUT OUT TO THE AMAZING VOLVO OF ONTARIO STAFF..TONY...SHAUN..JIM..TIM..MICHAEL...you guys utterly reek of pure heavenly awesomeness!! Xoxo the honey badger</text>

He said he would have someone take a look at it and let me know what repairs were needed.  To make a long story short he took care of some preventative maintenance items and gave me a list of all the other items that needed to be repaired.  We were planning a long trip in the car so was trying to make up our minds about buying a new car that we really didn't want to buy at this moment or get this car which we liked very much repaired.  Our trade in value for our car was not much and the repair bill, we (my wife and I, was a little high.  Faisal was able to lower $700 dollars off of our approx. $3700.00 repair bill.  So we went with the repairs and my wife was so impressed she said after we left the facility that if we ever sell our trailer we ought to come back here and look at an SUV type vehicle.  Because of Faisal's outstanding understanding of our situation we were able to get her car fixed at a reasonable rate and at the same time got my wife impressed with maybe buying another Volvo in a couple of years.  I would truly like to thank Faisal for his outstanding professionalism he demonstrated during our visit to your facility.  We will return.< /review><rate>5<//rate><pictures>None</pictures>< user_name>

<Text>Absolutely the best car buying experience we have ever had Tim Sydney and John gave us the best customer care and knowledgeable advice, we went to 2 other dealerships and just felt like it was the same old used car sales push even though we were looking for a new Volvo / the guys in Ontario worked hard for us as a team and showed us the best family atmosphere with a authentic true caring process. We will buy our next car from here and service our cars here from now on. The experience was next level from how clean the showroom and bathrooms were to the detailer who showed true care while he washed our new car A++++. Thank you Tim Sydney and John you guys are true gentlemen and pros in everything you did for us.</Text><pics>None</pics><response>None< /response><Gmap_id>0x80c34aa13c6e1e65:0xd3527e12557bd15b< /Gmap_id></record>

I had an appointment at 11:45 am with Juan Aranda and he showed up at 12:45 noon. I brought the car just for a routine check up, gave him the car remote key along with my house and mail key. They took the car for inspection and came back with a terrible diagnostic that would cost 6,800 dollars to fix. He said priority was 2,600 but offered a loan that could pay off in 6 months. All they want is to make good money so I just refused service, when I requested for the key they said they did not have it and blame it on me even though they were the ones who moved the car around. They gave me a rental car to go home and I had to come back with my spare key just to find that they won't replace my remote key just a regular key.
I DO NOT RECOMEND THIS PLACE AT ALL!! CUSTOMER SERVICE IS ONLY GOOD IF YOU AGREE TO PAY FOR THE SERVICE.
JUAN ARANDA WAS THE WORST!< /text>

My car went in at 10,000 miles for standard service. There were a few minor things that needed to be checked as well. Unfortunately, this service department is a nightmare. No courtesy/loaner cars available. Communication from the service department is terrible. I never got clear answers on what was done, what problems were discovered, and how those were recitified. Problems I wanted addressed were just overlooked with no resolution. No one picks up the phone in the service department and voicemails are not returned. My car actually left with more problems than it went in with.  I am now a month into my 10,000 mile service and I still need to bring my car in for the 4th time because they screwed something up on it yet again. I will not return here for any additional service. They clearly have no idea what they are doing.</review>

Stay away from them.

I called them to inquire about cost for an oil change; they gave me a good price comparable to other places. Upon getting there, the price changed and ended up paying $20.00 extra. That seemed small.

However, while i was there, Juan Aranda tried to push so many unnecessary repairs on me. I declined all. As I refused, he was conspicuously unhappy. Instead of 45 minutes promised for the oil changed, it took them 4hrs and 20 minutes. I purposely timed everything.

Also, while waiting (around the second hour), Juan came to call my attention to an oil leak. It was shocking because there was no leak anywhere before i got my car there and the oil leak looked fresh. Just out of curiosity, i asked for quotation for repair, alas, you could see his smile miles away. Of course, he quoted $650 and i refused the repair. Few minutes after that, he came back again with another problem and that would cost me extra $250. I was mad and just plainly told him to give my car back to me. Then, he turned away angrily.

After waiting for a total of 3 hours 54 minutes, i was informed my car was ready but Juan has the key. So I had to wait for another 20 minutes. The lady receptionist probably saw my surprise and made few calls with no response. At this point, i showed my disappointment and the receptionist quickly got up and began searching for Juana. Like magic, she found my car key hidden somewhere.  Finally, Juan showed up as I was about driving off and said, "come back to us, if you have more problems". And since I took my car home three weeks ago, it has been one problem after another. Only God knows what they did with/to my beautiful car.

Stay away from them. By the way, you do not have to believe me but you’re warned!</Review>

Service was amazing in the beginning, and throughout, until we received our car. We opted out for overseas delivery, and wrong information was provided to us. First we were told, we would get a leather dashboard, which makes car look on par with top mercedes, and when came to interior color we wanted complete blond, with dark mats. Well instead we got regular plastic dashboard (and there is no way to add Volvo leather dashboard now), also we got only top portion of the interior in blond, everything below is black (instead of just mats). Poor knowledge on the sales person side. This is $70K car and we did not get what we waited for 6 months. Dealership said, there is nothing they can do, and referred us to  aftermarket leather shop - must be a joke. During finances they included a line that did not apply to us, asked them to remove extra fee, and they did.
Lesson learned - Triple check everything on your own, do not trust them, do your homework, and check finances - on another hand, when you buy luxury car you expect dealership to do this work for you, otherwise why are they here?< /text>

It's really sad to see that a dealer has to lie to it's customers in order to stay afloat.

For the last few months, I've noticed a few unusual quirks in my S80. Headlights are dim, and alternator feedback penetrates the cabin quite loudly through the stereo. On top of that, using cabin electronics causes the other electronics to glitch out, some warning lights are on the dash, when the vehicle is shut off the alternator whines loudly, yadda yadda. It's not a huge deal, but it can be an annoyance.

I know it's an alternator, a few friends have experienced the problem before and it turned out to be the alternator, and an independent shop I have visited said it's the alternator.

I needed to get an oil change for my vehicle anyways, so it's time to take it to the dealer to get it taken care of and also get a quote for replacement of the alternator.

First off, I call asking for pricing on their oil changes. The secretary put me on hold and I waited for 10 min. She came back on the line and apologized, telling me it would be very soon. I wait another 10 minutes. Nothing. Tired of waiting, I hang up and just Google the average cost.

Arrive at the dealer for a 10:30 appointment. Wait about 45 minutes (11:15) to actually get the car looked at. So far I'm not impressed.

Asked service man to change oil and perform diagnostic. Time goes by. Car comes back.

"We performed the diagnostic. Results are back"

"Did you change the oil?"

"Oh.... no."

Car goes. Car comes back. Here's the kicker though, report says nothing about the alternator, but instead says almost every other electrical component needs to be replaced at a cost of $1500. I don't know if I should laugh or be disgusted.

There's no question at all, 1000000% sure that the alternator needs to be replaced (even if it's not the root of the experienced electrical problems). The fact that they said it's absolutely perfect tells me without a doubt they are lying.

Look, I'm not stupid. I know that Volvo has had abysmal sales in the US recently. That means dealers are making no money on vehicle sales and as a result, have to catch up by marking up, and probably even lying about service. They want me to spend all my precious money before they actually attack the problem itself in order to maximize their profit. The dealer is only trying to stay afloat, I get that - people have mouths to feed. I still don't think it's right to lie to customers.

Do yourself a favor and see if there's any European specialized maintenance shops in your area. They probably don't have to lie to keep themselves above water.

And who charges $300 for a spare key? Really?<//review>

<text>We bought a 2011 XC60 from Carmax.  Even though I was talked into buying their service warranty (for $2400 - DON'T DO IT!), I took it to the dealership to get a (cosmetic) part.  There I learned that I still had almost 20,000 left on the original warranty and subsequently discovered and repaired several issues that had likely been caused by non-dealer mechanics.  The car runs great and I couldn't be happier.  My other car is a Lexus RX350, but my next car will be a Volvo when we're ready to trade in one or both cars in a few years.< /text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

<text>MUST READ What Service Manager said After My Mother Had Passed Away of Cancer

HORRIBLE SERVICE ONTARIO VOLVO

On April 7th 2015 I brought my Volvo Xc90 to have an Oil change and have My Service Ryder Juan Aranda inspect a noise my front brakes were making a very Load Noise so load it embarrassing. I arrived at the location at 11:30 Am and left at almost 2pm.

The most important reason I had Brought my XC90to be checked and noise be dealt with was because on April 3rd my mother passed away and she was being laid to rest on May 9th 2015 and I made it very clear to service Ryder Juan I need to be repaired/fixed.

After I waited for almost 3 hours I asked Service Ryder Juan Aranda to ensure brake Noise was gone and again I reminded him why it was so important as I was putting attending my mother’s funeral and did not want my car to make such a Disturbing and annoying Noise during funeral perception. And his comments were and I (Quote) the technician found backing metal touching and he adjusted and noise is gone???

The Moment I drove of the parking lot to make a right to turn in to highway the noise come back I was so upset and disappointed and frustrated I drove home and called Service Ryder Juan Aranda who proceeded to tell me he was going to get back to me because he was going to check if he could do it under warranty As I purchased “Brakes for life” and again I express to him how disappointment I was and how I was going to show up at my mother’s funeral with such Horrible noise.

(Response From) Tony Rivas
I asked to speak to manager who I had to call myself and his response was so rude and disrespectful that I could not believe he told me as follows:

It’s not a big deal to drive your XC90 with noise to your mother’s funeral its normal all cars do that.. What Rude uncaring Service manager

The worst part in this whole thing is I did I had to drive my XC90 to my Mother’s funeral and drive the 8 miles with my Volvo making the horrific noise

Not a good place to have car serviced< /text><userid>101493401891629006408</userid>< response>

<Review>I go to Ontario Volvo mostly for oil change as generic lube centers don't have the genuine volvo oil filters. Everytime I go for an oil change the service advisor would tell me of a problem with my car. My S60 ihas only 85K miles. In particular, an advisor by the name of Juan Aranda, in a couple of occassions told me that a tube in the PCV system is busted and it is causing the expended oil to backflow which could blow out the gaskets in other parts (So basically a scare tactic!!!). He gave me an estimate of $650 for parts and labor. Aside from the PCV system, he mentioned several other things. He PRESSURED me so hard so that I would get the service there. I thought about it and declined.

I told my mechanic about the situation. He said there is no way they could see the tubes in the PCV system without taking the intake manifold out.He took the intake manifold, and lo and behold, all tubes are in good condition including the oil trap. Unfortunately he has to charge me for taking the intake manifold out.

Be very careful about committing to the services that Ontario Volvo recommends, especially when you deal with JUAN ARANDA. He will try hard to make you commit short of twisting your arm. THEY CLEARLY FABRICATE problems that does not exist. I said this because all my S60 needed was new spark plugs which I did myself and my S60 was running perfectly after.

Beware of JUAN ARANDA. He is a vulture looking for victims!

Go to Treynor's Volvo in Rancho Cucamonga instead. Although I have not had any service with them, they seemed very honest about my situation and said that at 85K, the likelyhood of having a busted tube in the PCV system is very unlikely!</Review></record></dataset><record>

<text>I originally came for a cheeseburger and fries which was really good but I saw they also had BBQ.

My next visit I got myself a 3 meat plate with brisket, pork ribs and hot links. I had baked beans and macaroni salad.l as my side.  I felt like my plate came from a family bbq, because that's what it tasted like. It was so good, I need to come back and try the rest of the menu.<//text><user_name>Everyday Alex<//user_name>< pictures>

Wow!!! The family and food here!

Beef ribs, brisket, Mac and Cheese that sells out... Louisiana style family recipes. I’m also getting pork rib tips and greens next time.

Jonathan Gold likes this joint and did a great write up before.

All wood smoked (which is very rare in LA).  There’s a great outdoor patio with shade too.

Can't wait to do more catering through this fam!!! JNJ!< /Review>

Terrible food, of course I got my money back.
Since it was to-go order.  If I did not take my time to go back to do something about it.  They would been smiling getting rid of that on me. Check your food before you leave.

<response>None< /response><Review>Absolutely a gem of a BBQ place. The place is unassuming corner neighborhood spot. I had the burnt ends, it was delicious! My son had the pork belly sandwich - melt in your mouth deliciousness.

I also had the scary hot bbq sauce and boy the heat lingered but it was out of this world good. I took the white bread included with the meal and soaked up the sauce - it was that good.

The Mac n Cheese was delicious as well.  Order from the side street side and then walk around to the covered bench seats.<//Review><Rating>5<//Rating><gmap_id>0x80c2b9a1e5722257:0x8e599a1f56ca2fc2</gmap_id><username>Ron T. Cho< /username>< userid>

JNJ Burger & Barbeque is a tiny location tucked away in a strip mall at a busy intersection but man is it worth it. I got the sliders and they were all super tasty. Staff was friendly. Will come again when I'm in the area.<//review>

<Text>From the very kind receptionist who took my order. Karen. To the cook who had our food earlier than expected. J. They were very thorough and professional. Order was hot, ready, correct and delicious. Everyone was certainly satisfied. Pork ribs were tender as well as the sliced beef. Sauces were just right and bread was fresh. I ordered 2 large and 1 small platter and all that was left was foil. Thank you.</Text>< userid>

<review>Wow!  Had been meaning to come here for some time and I'm really glad I did.  Truly legit and tasty BBQ.  Everything we had was great.

Pork ribs, pulled pork, coleslaw, yams, potato salad, mac and cheese, baked beans, even tasty real lemonade. Portions are generous and the prices are very reasonable for the quality and portions they are turning out.

Pork ribs had an insanely good smoke to them and the sauce was awesome. Super nice and friendly staff too. "I'll be back".< /review>< pictures>

good home style burger. Went to this place after my sister's suggestion. I got a turkey burger special with fries and a drink. Nice to go to a place in Los Angeles that's not pretentious and just has good food. Great customer service. kind of like a corner neighborhood burger stand.

My burger was good juicy and I didn't have to wait in a long line. Reminded me of the burger stands when I was growing up.< /text>

This whole in the burger joint is s must.  The burgers are delicious, the fries are crispy and the atmosphere is chill.  All the setting is outside but it's covered. Right behind the burger place a BBQ place which I hear is fantastic too. And adjacent to it are handful of small niche businesses.< /text>

We've eaten JNJ's barbecue several times; my favorite menu item is the 3 meat combo meal. Never have I been disappointed with just the ribs or the meals. JNJ Barbecue is our "go to" when we don't barbecue but want barbecue. I have yet to try JNJ Burgers however, I plan to and I expect I will not be disappointed.<//text>

<text>This place is a neighborhood jewel! Everything was so delicious. I love that they make it super easy to eschew the carbs in favor of tasty sides like brussel sprouts and kale slaw. Really reasonably priced too for hardy bbq.<//text>< pictures>

<user_id>107563921268803336812< /user_id><review>Amazing BBQ and burgers!

I ordered a 3 meat combo with pulled pork, pork ribs and brisket.

The sideorder was coleslaw and beans. My friend had an amazing burger!

Only reason that I not give this place 5 stars, is the amount of BBQ sauce. My meat was flooded in it. I don't know if this is common, but for me, it was way to much. Meat was so tender and had a good taste by it self, so a little shame to drown it in that amount of sauce :)

Next time, I will order the sauce on the side!<//review><pics>None<//pics><resp>None< /resp>< Rating>

<text>The burger side is closed for now, due to staffing issues. Bummer. Hopefully they'll be able to fix it. The burgers were really tasty, and they had good, thick-ish fries. A 4.5-star when they were open. How many stars do you give for a place that's closed?

UODATE: Stopped by Saturday, and it's shurdown. No signage, no seating, boarded up. It's a shame they could keep a local institution going<//text><username>Mykel Lefkowitz</username><gmap_id>0x80c2b9a1e5722257:0x8e599a1f56ca2fc2< /gmap_id>< user>

I wish I could give this place 5 stars based on the taste of the food alone. However the service has been so horrible that it’s propmted this review. The last 4 times I’ve come here they couldn’t accept card payment. Also, they don’t serve burgers everyday and don’t disclose this information on their online menu either. Trying to call ahead is pointless as well since they never answer the phone. They make a great turkey burger, you just have to go thru hell and high water to actually order and purchase it. I won’t be returning to this establishment.</review>

I've not eaten the BBQ side so this review is limited to the burgers. First what a great guy "J" is the proprietor, friendly helpful, humble. We tried a few variations of the burgers. The bacon was tasty, the chili wonderful and the meat, seemed like hand made patties, wholesome, tasty like beef, not frozen. The double is huge. old school, humble place,cozy patio solicitous staff, onsite parking  ..when in the Fairfax Aams area again i will return for the BBQ too< /review>

<Text>I ordered delivery on grub hub. Initially given the time of 5:20 for delivery. Then it changed to 5:35-5:45. At 6:00 I tried to call the restaurant to see where the order was and they never answered.  Contacted grub hub and they could not get in touch with them either.  Food never came.

<Review>Brisket sandwich ($10) was soooo good - pieces of meat interlaced with fat just melted in my mouth.  went back and got the pork ribs. a little over $12 for 5 large ribs with delicious smokey flavor infused in the meat, bbq sauce, 2 sides, and bread. meat was mostly tender but a few parts were tough - expected from that cut of pork.

must go back to try their burgers sometime, and more BBQ!</Review><userid>109256489201440094558< /userid>< Pictures>

Where to start....
Cashier needs training on customer service and people skills
Specially with someone who never been to JnJ. But I ordered a cheeseburger and a hamburger with fries
After I received my order and look at a half empty bags a fries I told her this is what we getting for $3.25 per order.
She just said (I'm surprised too they make us measure the fries)
Never again I only went there because my daughter wanted to try out the place but it failed. We are sticking to Astros burgers<//Review>

The ribs are great, but what makes the whole thing come together are their baked beans. I dont believe they use brown sugar but molasses, which is the proper way to make beans.
The location is terrible and its smart to bring a jacket if its cold out because its shaded but its terrific. Just go<//text>< pics>

You can get Louisiana style BBQ and a burger all in one place. Plus there are other small business right next door to get coffee or vegetables.<//text>

I payed 11$ for a burger and fry and waited 15 mins and They didn't get my order right. I went back and asked nicely for them to fix it and it took them 5 more mins but all they did was give me a new cold bun and a little lettuce (MY ORDER WAS STILL WRONG). Small portions and cold frys and it wasn't even busy. Not to mention rude service. I'm never going back and I don't know how they got these stars. Nice looking place but horrible quality in all department that matter.< /review>

Best burgers around

Literally the spot for burgers. You won't find a better one. They have good service so that's always a plus. Can get a bit pricy sometimes but it's worth it.</Text>

Great store for all your Indian food supplies and food too. A good selection of dried and packaged items and a big freezer. Small selection of vegetables. Their samosas are excellent.</Review>

The first time I ate here I wasn't impressed. My husband and I decided to give it a second try. Boy are we glad that we did. He had the hotplate with the chicken which tasted amazing I had the albacore seared rare with the spinach salad which was unbelievably good. The dressing was good the nuts were nice and crunchy and the fish was perfect.< /text>

<text>This neighborhood Indian grocery and thali spot was 6 stars before the change of ownership. Now it is a 3. I gave it 4 out of nostalgia.

The previous owners were friendly in a chatty sort of way. The new guys always look at me like "oh hell" when I walk through the door.

The last time we went my wife got only one roti with her thali!

<text>I've been shopping at this place off and on for 16 years. I moved abroad for a few years, but now I'm back and this place is exactly the same. They have an extremely high turn around rate, so everything is always fresh and newly stocked. Employees are friendly and always have answers to my questions. This place is significantly cheaper than other stores with the same products, and you don't have to deal with the hassle of Artesia to get them.</text><gmap_id>0x80dcdbe3c45995bd:0x16a1eef5e8fb870d<//gmap_id><pics>None</pics></record></dataset><record>

Most of the products here are pricier than other store. Worst part i found many products which were expired already. I notified the owner but it looks like he simply don't care. I went to nearby store "Bodega" and they have almost all Indian groceries at correct price. Never coming back here again.<//Text>

The food has no preservatives, no thickeners, good quality ingredients and tastes home cooked. Nothing fancy but prices could be lower.
Sweet Lassi here is by far the best I have had ever since I left India; just the way my mom used to make it. Coming back for sure.< /Review>< Pictures>

The place is a grocery store, overloaded on walkways, with a restaurant crammed in with minimal eating space, no regards to customer comfort. Decent management extracting everything out. Dessert dishes kept until hygiene iffy. Typically low  life Indian American.<//review>

I went in to pick up some of their delicious samosas and pakoras for a small get together. They are always a big hit. The parking situation in that center can be crowded at times, so give yourself a couple extra minutes cushion to look for a parking spot when planning a visit.<//Text>

Not happy with the price. Every single item is more than compare to the normal price.<//Text>

<Review>Great grocery store for Indian food, but the REAL hidden gem here is their amazing lunch buffet!  The garlic naan is some of the crispiest and most delicious I’ve ever had.  Also suggest their palak paneer, samosas, papad, and chana.< /Review>< gmapID>

I have been coming to this store for many years... This is closest to me unless I am going to Pioneer. small shop but they have everything... owner family is very nice and the workers there are good too.. Good Cust Service. They always offer me help with my bags..
I am big on customer service and I find it here.. I see many reviews with 3 or less stars here but no description of the issue..
I highly recommend this store. Check it yourself by visiting.</Text>

I’ve been going here since I was four and it’s still run by the same family! They’re very kind hardworking folks who take care of their customers. Everything is well priced. The small food area is great too! Really nice homestyle vegetarian food!</Text>

This is by far the most well stocked Indian Grocery store in Orange County ..Their products are generally from very fresh batches and their small food kitchen serves simple yet amazing home like North Indian food. The owners are also very police and helpful. I have been visiting them since 2005 with no issues or complaints ever. Also, their prices are the lowest in this area.<//Text>

One of my most favourite Indian grocery shop. They have a very small shop run by all family members mostly, good part is unlike Namaste plaza, this is very organized and they have a very good collection of all Indian products be it sweet or spices or oil or any other. They keep small amount but good quality of Indian vegetables and some Indian frozen delicacies too. However their price might seem a little higher occasionally but their deli section is really worthy of money. Specially the sweets are fresh and tasty. It’s always advisable to call and check if they have a certain thing at their shop and that way you can save a lot of time and gas. Also their deli section remains closed on certain days of the week.

The only bad thing is the parking which is hard to get on busy day and time.</review>

<Review>Ok so the only reason I gave it a 3 star is because their food was horrible! I mean really gross. I’ve never had Indian food so bad before. The rice had so much water in it that ink ew for a fact they had frozen it and microwave it whenever someone orders. The vegi dish was stale and really unappetizing. But I highly recommend their sweets and other grocery items. Just don’t eat the food...ugh</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

<Rate>4</Rate><review>This is a small store and anything you need is easy to find. Despite the small area, the spread of the goods is surprisingly good. In fact I usually get a few items here that I don't in the stores in Artesia (Pioneer Boulevard). The store also boasts of small plates and chaat items that are freshly made.
Only caveat is that the goods may be a few cents expensive than the competition.< /review>< pictures>

Its a good place for Indian groceries shopping and large variety is available, but not a very good ambience, it's a small place, snacks taste isn't consistent. Overall recommended< /Review>

Come for chhole samosa and masala chai, stay for Ras Malai and Veg Thali (lunch special) in between. Clean, fresh, healthy and tasty food. All day, every day. (Best chhole samaosa outside India, east or west of New Delhi! IMO) Owners and employees are hard-working good people.<//review>

Oh my! I see Pardon My French Bakery on Instagram all the time. I thought self you should go do some errands and drop by & check this place out, so I went! As you see it is set up beautifully and the sweet smell that greets you is mesmerizing “REALLY “ ! I bought a chocolate chip scone and it is gigantic! The quality of the chocolate chips are fantastic, they melted as soon as I chomped down a bite! It was moist and tender not too sweet “perfect” a lil crunch of a glaze was a thoughtful touch to a delicious scone! I’ll definitely be back, next time I run to do my errands! 🤓< /Review>

<Text>I had a custom birthday cake made. I sent them a photo of what I wanted and they made it exactly like I envisioned! I got the tiramisu cake and it was honestly the best cake we've ever had. Not too sweet, very moist, stable and easy to cut. Best of all, no fondant! Everything was icing and chocolate. Delicious and beautiful! We also love their cupcakes and macarons. Thank you guys so much!!!< /Text>< Pictures>

I ordered a chocolate cake for my son's birthday. Due to the pandemic everything was coordinated via email and Venmo which was helpful.  The cake was amazing I was skeptical in ordering chocolate cake because I was concerned it would be too sweet nonetheless I ordered it since it was my son's favorite I was wrong! The cake was the best chocolate cake I have had the taste,  texture,  was incredible.  Highly recommend it. The pastries are also great I love the coffee cake a must try.< /text>

Grover Beach has two of the best bakeries in the whole area. This one and Grover Beach Sourdough. Pardon My French is more about desert style pastries and they are exceptional.</review>

I can't even with the cakes.
And the macarons.
And the cupcakes.
And pretty much the whole case.

Go. Spend $50 on the wonderfulness.
And I guarantee you will not regret a damn calorie.

Oh and on top of the taste, everything is gorgeous, too.< /Text>

Yes it is not donut inexpensive, but good food is not donut cheap. The chocolate tasted like chocolate. The cream puff did not have the cool whip flavor you get at a retail shop. The macaroon was delicate.< /text>< pictures>

Small boutique type bakery that located inside a strip mall. They didn't have any signs with their name on it yet so look for a generic "Bakery" sign with some brown outdoor plastic patio furniture. Staff here is friendly even though we walked in 20 minutes before closing.

Their cupcakes are the star here. The different flavors are in their fillings. The Passion Fruit, Pineapple and Coconut Scones was my favorite and their cookie taste good although I prefer mine on the chewy side.<//text>

My wife has been going there for quite some time to buy cupcakes and pastries for work and other occassions.
And now we will be there even more because we won a dozen cupcakes a month for a year.
Look out waistline. Is there such a thing as a diet pastry?<//Text>

<pics>None</pics><Review>I first learned of Lolo and Jamie's wonderful bakery a couple of months ago.  Wow, after my first visit I had to call back to the bakery and say thank you.  Lolo is a master craftsman, everything I have tried has been exquisit.  They only use the best ingredients, I swear that even the cinnamon had to be special it was so good.  I can recommend anything, and if you are looking for a fancy cake, this is the place.
One of my personal favorites is the bread pudding, made from leftover croissants and is the best I have ever had.

The lady was very attentive to both of us. The deserts were out of this world!. The hot tea was served in a giant mug ( none of those little " tiny, raise your pinky" type of cups. ) We got some cupcakes to go, as well as eating there!
Also enjoyed the art display!
Every month or two, they have an artist display their work. This one had a variety of subjects.
All things considered, it was a great experience!</review>

Old School yummyness, one almost is overcome when opening the door, smells so good. Then the trouble begins. Which one does one choose? This is not the place for puny weight watchers but for folks what enjoy fresh baked goodness.< /text>

This place needs to be recognized on a national level. The most delicious and perfectly crafted variety of sweets around! Was really surprised (in a great way!) at the quality and flavor balance of their cupcakes. Almond croissant is unbelieeeeevable.

Don’t think twice, come right in.</review>

I can't tell if my favorite part of this bakery is the awesome food or the fantastic people who work here! I haven't had a less-than-great item here yet (believe it or not, the cupcakes are my least favorite item and they are still great!), and the environment that has been cultivated is top notch. They have the work of local artists featured on the walls, great music, outdoor seating & a water bowl for their canine visitors, and friendly conversation ready for all who stop by. This place is worth your time.</text>

The Bakery was filled with enormous baked treats; and each item was double the size of a regular french pastry. According to the Pastry Chef, he believes in "going big"; hence "the bigger the better"! And I agree, more Coffee Cake please!!<//review>

I had a cinnamon roll cupcake and it was the most delicious cupcake I've ever had. Everyone needs to experience it. They have a great variety to choose from and even have delicious croissants and cookies! I just went for my first visit and I'm going back to get goodies for my friends!</Text>

<text>I ordered 2 dozen cupcakes, which were beautiful,  and a smash cake for my daughters  1 year Birthday.   I told them the colors of the party and asked them to be creative....they made me a BLACK smash cake!  It was awful.  Not only did I have to decorate it myself with flowers to make it more colorful and eye worthy, but my daughter's skin and clothes,  as well as mine, are all stained black!  Also, the cake itself was too hard to even be smashed...my daughter eventually just pushed it off the high chair.  I am truly disappointed.  I can't understand why any bakery would think a black cake is suitable for a 1 year old girl's Birthday.   I will certainly not be recommending or purchasing from them again.</text><time>1531104744284< /time><user_name>Crystal Silvera<//user_name><user_id>102052039751052767007< /user_id><pictures>None<//pictures><gmapID>0x80ec5eb61ed0eaa1:0xbeebb3fe683f5fe3<//gmapID><Resp>{'time': 1531109603535, 'text': 'We are so sorry you feel this way.

Went in with my sister this afternoon, and discovered the Kouign Amann. If you see this on their shelves, get one. It's like a sugary, buttery, flaky piece of dessert heaven. ❤️ This is my second or third time here, and each time has been amazing. Great owners, and staff. 5 stars for sure.< /review>

I happened to find this little bakery in my search. Staff was extremely friendly and helpful. Cupcakes are underpriced in my opinion. You get a quality cupcake for under $3. I am from San Diego, CA and just visiting. Wish I had this bakery closer, I would go all the time.<//review>

Soooo good! Jamie and Lalo are such gems. They created a custom menu for our “receptioniesta”! I am left dreaming about the pineapple mouse with tajin on top, the panna cotta, Mexican chocolate French macarons, and the pina colada cupcakes. To top it off, they helped me surprise my groom with a special pie, too. So talented, and always willing to do something different. HIGHLY recommend!</review>

Chee Cake, Chee Cake, Cheecake (a take on Cheeburger, Cheeburger, Cheeburger from a long forgotten SNL classic with John Belushi in the Olympia Cafe...see Wiki), absolutely certain to release tons of Dopamine in your brain & trigger old NYC genuine fresh CHEESECAKE.  They get my former born & raise NYer seal of approval....which is very hard to achieve.  Their other items are "icing on the Cheecake"....and they nice people here are happy to serve you other yummy things.
...but the Chee Cake was so good, we came here two days in a row to get another slice & we live several miles away. It is that fresh & good!</Review>

<Response>{'time': 1532050742946, 'text': 'We are so sorry you were not impressed. My husband is the only baker and he bakes everything from scratch and fresh everyday.  The morning is always the best time to go, as we start every day off with 9 different breakfast pastries, 3 types of cookies, 6 cold case dessert items and 8 different flavored cupcakes. The options definitely diminish as the day goes on, but we will be back in the morning full stocked up with fresh items for the day. Come check us out at 8am for the best selection!'}< /Response></record>

Before I even get to the food. When you walk in, the furnishing is "Eh". Didn't have half of the stuff on the menu. I wanted the Bone-in chicken breast meal, the guy said "I only have boneless"- that was ok, I like boneless. For my sides I wanted mac & cheese, corn- he replied "I don't have corn. I only have Mac, greens, yams & veggies". They had like 5 flavors of soda on menu, I wanted a pineapple - > "I only have orange & Limon lime". Then I had to wait like 40-45 mins for the food, smh. It was fresh, sure, but couldn't go here on lunch break, takes too long. Some people came in after me and wanted to order wings, I think- they didn't have wings.

Now to the food: chicken was seasoned well and fully cooked. Mac was ok, I've had better, but also have had worse. I don't know if I'll give it another chance, maybe I'll call in the order next time. The prices are reasonable. Black owned & Black run, but got to do better on the presentation of the place.< /Text>

It's soul food!! -- never to be confused with "gourmet". And my catfish dinner was just as perfectly "home cooked" as at my mom or grand-moms.  The best greens I've EVER had outside of my moms house.  Lastly, I was the last customer as they were closing up - yet the smiling friendly young lady invited me to sit and comfortably eat my meal whilst she packed and cleaned up! I'll be back here for sure!</text>

The food was very good. The green beans, collard greens, fried fish, turkey chops... we will be back. The candied yams were better than average. It's a place to be casual and enjoy food! Check it out.</review>

<username>Denise Chandler<//username><text>This is my second time going to this soulfood place both times the fried chicken and collard greens are delicious but the service is bad. The lady has an attitude and she acts like she is doing you a favor by ordering food. Twice i been there she never smiles just overall not pleasant. Also the wait time for my food takes too long, i waited 45 minutes just for my chicken and there was 2 other people there before me must have waited at least 1 hour if my wait was 45 minutes. I understand the food is fresh but too long of a wait and just overall the customer service is not good. Too bad food is great but just do not want to come back.<//text>< gmapID>

Good prices. A small whole in the wall. Food was decent. We tried the Pork chop dinner with a side of greens and Mac and cheese. Friend catfish with a side of yams. And Banana pudding for dessert. All was ok. Not much in the way of customer service but I didn't think they were rude. Just no personality. I will go again I'm curious about a few menu items.< /Review>

My sister and I went to the taste of soul on Saturday but we did not get to taste the food because the lines were crazy long . So us being greedy and wanting some soul food we decided to go to MARJOES and I was very satisfied with the service the food was delicious and the price was fare . Try MARJOES soul food you will not be disappointed.<//review>

The wait did take a while even though I called ahead, they didn't have a few things I wanted to order but other than those two things the food was really good and the man inside( there was only one person) was supper nice and I will be going back again.< /Review>

We were hungry and it almost 11:00 on Sunday night of Memorial Day Weekend and they were open!
They made us feel like it was early in the evening and welcomed us inside.
My Boyfriend wanted a certain type of table, so the Mamger personally escorted there and gave us a free dessert .
The food and Service was EXCELLENT.  We both had their Bison Meatloaf and loved it.
We will definitely be back to a Restaurant that know the meaning of the word, CUSTOMER SERVICE.<//text>

This is the perfect place to take your dog! They have a patio area outside for non-service pets while service pets are allowed inside. The food is delicious and there are even items on the menu for your pet! We felt pretty spoiled!😁</Review>

<Rating>5</Rating><review>I really like this local restaurant. Food is consistently good and the servers have always been fantastic. I really like the tent the establishment erected for Covid and I hope they won't remove it. The access is somewhat difficult for the servers and perhaps management will address this. Bottom line...great place and much improved with the larger outdoor area.<//review>< pics>

I recommend the lazy dog but suggest the beer should be much colder and served in a container to keep it chilled.   The lunch menu items are good quality even though I do not have a favorite.   Comfy atmosphere where one can relax and enjoy a conversation with out some crazy back ground music blaring in the background.<//text>

<Name>Robert Binder<//Name><date>1598487626275<//date><Rate>5< /Rate><Review>Had the best experience having lunch/brunch with my family this weekend. We were sat right away by a very welcoming host and taken to a table by the TVs so my grandfather could watch the soccer game. Our server, Jacob, was fantastic! He was extremely attentive, helpful, super funny, and made us all feel like family. The food was excellent all around and our drinks were constantly refilled before getting near the bottom. I wasn't sure what to get on the menu due to the large variety of options, Jacob suggested the carnitas tater tot hash and it was to die for! Best service I've had in a restaurant in a long time and we will be back!< /Review>< Pictures>

<text>This is my review based on this one experience. I’ve been before without the issues we had this time, but I will likely not return anytime soon.
Had a drink at the bar without any issues while waiting for a table.
The table took longer than quoted, but not by too much and it was a Friday evening, so somewhat expected. I think the process for having guests check back in once notified could be improved, especially when busy. There was no clear spot for us to return, so we waited in line with people adding their names to the list.
Once seated, we were greeted warmly and promptly, but when it came time to order drinks, it was clear the server was not well-versed in the available options. We asked about flavored spirits and the server just named brands, not flavors. When we asked for something listed as as an ingredient in a specialty cocktail, she said they didn’t have it. When the drink arrived, it wasn’t made correctly and the replacement took an unusually long time.
Now to the food.  I started with a side salad, which, while it looked appealing, had a pool of water at the bottom and was drenched in gloppy ranch dressing.
The pot pie I ordered was decent and the others at the table enjoyed their entrees, but they weren’t anything special.
Unfortunately, the food was not good enough to overcome the clunky service to make me want to return.<//text><response>None< /response>< rate>

Last night we had a party of 10 that grew to 12. They were so accommodating! We had an inside table, the food and drinks were excellent (try the seared ahi with cauliflower mash!). The service for our large party was excellent, and she even split the checks without us even asking. Lazy Dog rocks<//text>

<Text>This review is long overdue. I've been to this location several times. I've always had an amazing experience. The food and drinks are great but the service is what makes this place stand out. The servers are always smiling and willing to help. Already looking forward to going back.< /Text>< pics>

Loved my bunless PBJ burger in a lettuce cup w/ a side of apple cider slaw. I like the way they did their lettuce & paper wrap. Heated patio was full so we chose to eat in the car. They gave ample napkins & the togo container fits nicely on your lap. I look foward to trying the Lazy Dog TV Dinners tonight<//text>

<Text>I adore this place! They have high class dishes, their menu is nice, The chief cook in that restaurant is very experienced, I enjoy a lot tasting all their food. The dishes are always fresh, the attitude towards the guests  is very good too. I  go often to this place and I not even once was unhappy. I recommend it to all.< /Text>< pics>

<Review>What a great remodel! The are so many great new things top look at. It seems the menu has also been refreshed with many new additions. I had a plain old chicken Cobb salad. It was very fresh and filled with fresh shredded chicken. Not a lot of avocado but very flavorful nonetheless. My wife got the Thai Chicken salad which was also very generous with chicken and really flavorful. Probably just me but does the new range of suggested tip percentages slightly annoy anyone else? 22% now and 15% isn't a presented option anymore. Oh well....<//Review>< Pics>

This is my review based on this one experience. I’ve been before without the issues we had this time, but I will likely not return anytime soon.
Had a drink at the bar without any issues while waiting for a table.
The table took longer than quoted, but not by too much and it was a Friday evening, so somewhat expected. I think the process for having guests check back in once notified could be improved, especially when busy. There was no clear spot for us to return, so we waited in line with people adding their names to the list.
Once seated, we were greeted warmly and promptly, but when it came time to order drinks, it was clear the server was not well-versed in the available options. We asked about flavored spirits and the server just named brands, not flavors. When we asked for something listed as as an ingredient in a specialty cocktail, she said they didn’t have it. When the drink arrived, it wasn’t made correctly and the replacement took an unusually long time.
Now to the food.  I started with a side salad, which, while it looked appealing, had a pool of water at the bottom and was drenched in gloppy ranch dressing.
The pot pie I ordered was decent and the others at the table enjoyed their entrees, but they weren’t anything special.
Unfortunately, the food was not good enough to overcome the clunky service to make me want to return.</Text>

Freakin De-li-cious! Great little family owned spot. Hands down, the best in the area.  Had their rare steak pho, steamed dumplings (add kimchi) and we did not regret finishing any of it. New favorite spot.</text>

This is one of the best sit down restaurants in the Marketplace. Excellent menu with really great food that is just the right amount of hipster without being insufferably snobby. I can't wait to eat here more often after quarantine.

They allow dogs here though, so be careful if you are allergic. Also please stock more Huckleberry Haze please! You guys seem to always be running out of it ❤️</Text>

Fried mushrooms are awesome
Lamb pot pie was perfectly cooked and seasoned well balanced and scrumptious
Blue corn grits and the blue cornbread served with the chili was unique and amazing.<//text><UserId.>104801711442901325822<//UserId.>< rating>

This was our go to place! At the beginning of the year and the pandemic they were awesome with curbside we tried multiple family meals and they did great! NOW it’s 100x worse! I don’t know what happened newer less trained staff? Burnt out? All of the above! The past three times we have gone in the past 2.5 months we have waited over 20-30 minutes in our car for cold food, if they were making it fresh and we got it hot we could forgive such a wait, but every time it’s cold. Something is going horrible wrong here these days and the staff seem absolutely clueless, missing how it used to be. Three strikes and your out.< /text>

I really like this place. The only reason I gave it 3 stars is cuz We waited 30 minutes for outdoor seating and they added another 15 minutes. We had enough and just left. Cya< /text>

<Review>After a hard day of work, a greasy burger is exactly what I needed. I ordered the Pig champion, because anything with pig and egg is a must order in my book. I also ordered Anvil fries, because it had cheese curds and duck! The food came out fairly quickly, and it was huge!  Everything was amazing and exactly what I needed. They also some pretty good sauces that I can't remember but take your time and try them all. Also, their deep fried dessert sounded tempting but I think my body would probably hate me if I tried to eat anymore.</Review></record></dataset><record>

<text>This is a gluten free review.

Gluten free menu: Yes! Request a gluten free menu when you are being seated

What I ordered: I did the unconventional and ordered gluten free carrot cake before my meal, followed by a Cobb salad and French fries

Gluten free options: 3/5
Super impressed that they have a gluten free cake. This is not your average gluten free dessert, but it’s made with almond flour and was absolutely incredible.

Food: 4/5
I was impressed with the cake and the fried. The salad was short on a lot of toppings. It was 90% lettuce and 10% toppings. Felt a little jipped this time around when it came to the salad. The rest of the meal was amazing though, which is why I can justify this rating. They really do have the best French fries. Perfectly crispy!

Service: 2/5
Our server was friendly but not attentive. It took about 15 mins to receive the cake. We also were never asked for a water refill. I also noticed that most of the servers congregate near the bar, are talking, laughing, and then they disperse at around the same time. Not really efficient for taking care of their customers.

Location: 4/5
Parking is abundant and the restaurant is easy to locate

Ambiance: 3/5
Casual and comfortable environment. You can bring your dog to eat on the patio.

Price: 4/5
$37 for two people. Two entrees, appetizer, no drinks. Not bad!

Overall score: 4/5<//text></record>

<review>Consistent quality of food, always vegetarian options. Dogs allowed in the patio area. We had the Spaghetti Squash and Beet Balls (vegetarian), Fettuccini with Shrimp, Sweet Potato Tots, Bison Meatloaf, and the Pork Shoulder. Portions are big. Cocktails are  pricey, but the homemade ginger beer is very good. Decent list of beers, but if you're a fan of stouts or porters, you're out of luck. Guinness is all they have, the rest is IPAs and other hoppy beers. It's very loud, but that's pretty normal for places like this. Service has been ok every time we've been.  Good family place.< /review><Rating>4< /Rating><userid>101171455224188379232<//userid><gmapID>0x80dcdb808573fff5:0xae76d2b0c6ab747d</gmapID>< pics>

I arrive at this excellent restaurant once a month because I like the  special atmosphere that is unique to this place. The team is extremely attentive and skilfull. The service is absolutely efficient. Needless to say, the food they cook is exceptionaly good. I visited many times and I was always happy. The expense is fair. I suggest this restaurant to to everybody.</review>

One of the best places I've ever eaten. Excellent food, terrific service, reasonable prices. The servers split my partner's and my dishes evenly between us without being asked and we each got a good sized portion. Definitely a repeat restaurant. They even serve water and food for dogs in the outdoor area.<//Review>

<Review>I came for lunch and ordered the ribs. Nice thing here is they separate the ribs for easier eating. They are still messy though. I might go with easy sauce next time. They are delicious and perfectly cooked. The lunch service is very good. Only downside is another time I went to see a football game and they don't have NFL ticket. All TV's were on the same game. I'll be back because everything on the menu looks good.</Review><user>102441504788775133021< /user><Gmap_id>0x80dcdb808573fff5:0xae76d2b0c6ab747d<//Gmap_id><pictures>None</pictures>< user_name>

<text>Went there for the first time with my wife's family, they had fantastic food and friendly service.  I had a black and blue burger, wife had the bison chili, we all shared an order of candied bacon. It was delicious! And they are very dog friendly, I got to pet a few while we were waiting outside for a table to open up. I think they generally limit the dogs to outdoor seating, but I'm not sure.<//text>< Pictures>

<Review>I thought I really liked the food at the Lazy Dog, and perhaps it was just this location rather than the one I normally frequent, or perhaps it’s a supply chain issue because of Covid...but the quality the food was not up to par. The Cobb salad didn’t have all the ingredients on it that are listed in the description, and it was quite puny! For a $12 salad, I was still hungry and had to eat an apple on the way home from dinner with a friend! The service was also quite slow. I had to flag down the hostess to get our server when I needed some thing. My beer came fairly quickly but the server forgot to bring my friends lemonade and she had to ask for it after the meals came .  All in all, was totally disappointed. The two stars go directly towards the good beer (some hazy huckleberry IPA); that was the only enjoyable part of the dinner, aside from the company of my friend.<//Review>< name>

<Review>Grilled Steak Salad: Where's the beef? Looked colorful but was very skimpy with the beef and very wet and overly dressed. Smallest entree salad I ever saw. This was not a lunch special this petite salad was from the main menu.< /Review>< Pictures>

Great place for a happy hour. Met with a group of 12 friends.  Large outside patio with heat lamps. Dog friendly.  Good menu with some varied options. Not just the same stuff you get at other restaurants.</Text>

Outdoor fireplace was wonderful - wish there were seats on the other side so more people could enjoy the bonfire feel. Service was great - friendly, timely and helpful - knew which friends had just came and immediately offered menu and requested drink order.  Not over bearing or pushy - just notably accommodating and happy. Food was good. Drinks were good.  They have fried deviled eggs - that was fun to try.</Review>

Be careful they will lie right to your face. Called manager twice never I mean never got a call back. Do not value the customer.

Such a great spot and to make it a top choice is that your allowed to bring your dog. The only thing is service animals are allowed inside only, there is outdoor sitting with very limited covered shaded area which is a bit of a bummer in these hot sunny days that is why i gave it 4 stars or i would of gaven 5. The food quality is great, drinks are great, and dog menu is great too. The price is a bit on the high/average but worth the trip with friends and furry loved ones. I been here more than once and ill definitely come again but hope they do more shade and fans? Its been hot lately.</text>

Where do I even start.  This place is amazing and I wish there was one here in Oklahoma.  I was in California for only 4 days and went there 3 times if that tells you anything.  The pot pie tasted amazing.  The staff are really nice.  The bison burger was unique but good.<//text>

As if they're trying to hard to look fancy. No one in my group finished our meals. I ordered shrimp and grits. Something I get all of the time wherever its served. Grits are white as far as I'm concerned but they served brown grits that I suspected was quinoa. Either way it tasted good but it looked like a plate of shrimp and dog sh** which ruined my appetite. But the drinks were strong and satisfying so I totally can't trash the place.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None</response>< Gmap_id>

I just wanted to thank Elizabeth at the Irvine location for going above and beyond after having a really bad delivery experience. Elizabeth went out of her way to make things right and we truly appreciate what she did and how she took care of us! Elizabeth is an asset to this store!<//text>

The food is always really good and the staff very friendly. I don't even own a dog but I love them so that's a nice aspect of this place as well. Lots of canines.</text>

Every time I come to this location, I'm ignored by the wait staff. It was so bizarre that the waiter would actually acknowledge everyone, including a toddler in a highchair, but me on my last visit to the restaurant. If I go to the Huntington Beach location, I have a much different experience and the food tastes better. I'm not sure what the disconnect is but I don't plan on visiting the location at the District anymore after having a negative experience each time.</Text>

While in Anaheim this restaurant was recommended to me. I’m so glad it was. The service was very fast and friendly. The food was perfect both tasty and generous portions. Lots of free parking also. Celebrated another birthday and connection down in orange county! Lazy dog was again exceptional and the food, service and Ambiance! Can’t go wrong here.... reat Casual Menu, Lots and Lots of Comfortable choices, and the presentation always Fun- Hello- Peanut & Jelly on a Hamburger?, good to have a Sense of Humor- they do!< /text>

We ordered take out to be ready by 6:30 we got there at about 6:50 and waited till 7:20 to receive our food while it just sat out for a good 30 minutes. The hostess was no help she was just chatting with co workers while we waited for our already prepared food to be handed to us. Horrible experience by the time we got home food was cold. Definitely would not return or buy food here ever again.</Text>

I loved that there was a place that I could bring my pup to. They were so nice and thoughtful, they love their pups. My girl got a free beef patty amd brown rice yesterday for Halloween because she was dressed as a seahawks fan. Lol... the happy hour deals were great, cocktails were delicious and I loved my portobello burger.</Text>

<Review>I love lazy dog - definitely the best in it's category of the "we have everything" kind of restaurants. Somehow, their Thai Noodles are incredible ... Last thing you'd think to get there.  Love to stop by late night with our pup. 4/5 because we've had some shoddy service there a few times.</Review>< pictures>

<text>This is a very nice place for dinner. I got the ahi tuna crusted with sesame seeds. It had an interesting miss sauce that went well with the fish. The drink I got was the cucumber thyme fresca. It was very refreshing as well. They have other items on the menu such as burgers and fish n chips. The menu is a bit pricey for a casual dinning place. But overall the food is good.< /text>< Pictures>

Nothing lazy about this place. Good food and nice people. Staff was friendly, busy and helpful, and food was fresh and very good. Their menu features many interesting items, but decided on the BBQ bison meatloaf. It was hot and delicious, and went well with a Guinness draft. Can't wait to try more.</review>

Went for lunch with around 15 co-workers. Our waiter did not get upset with this, and got all our orders correctly. I ordered the shrimp tacos and they were amazing. However, one of my co-workers is allergic to shell fish, and they seemed to have mixed her chicken with some of the seafood and she got sick, even after informing the waiter. Another co-worker ordered a pulled pork sandwich and there was hardly any meat. Those that ordered a salad or soup got full with them before their actual meal, so plan accordingly. The decor is fun to look at as a dog lover too. The portions are a good size, and service was good. I would come back.< /review>

I highly suggest sitting at the bar if you can. They always have friendly and attentive service. The restaurant in general has great service but I think that the bar is the way to go!
Happy Hour prices are great! And the selection is better than anywhere else in the area.</Text>

<review>Lazy Dog is a great place to go both to have a drink at happy hour or eat a full meal at dinner. Lazy dog has an extensive menu offers food for almost anyone. From pizzas to Burgers to salad even the pickiest eater and find something to eat. Combine the quality of the food with the very affordable prices, Lazy Dog is a destination for great overall experience. I like the California Burger. I also like the shrimp tacos. The garlic bread is also very good. I eat poke is good. And of course the bar has great drinks.</review>< pictures>

If you live in the area this is an ideal casual restaurant where one an indulge on a burger and a good beer. Prices are what you would expect and service is good. Family friendly, but also great for happy hour.</Review>

Great service. Seems like they've refreshed the menu lately, lots of interesting options. I had the bison meatloaf. This ain't your momma's meatloaf. Moist and delicious. The fried deviled eggs appetizer was pretty darn good.<//Review>

One of the better places around the marketplace and usually insanely packed on the weekends. We came here on Friday and were super lucky to grab a table in the bar area. It is free seating in the bar area, but line for tables was long, at least a 30 minute wait. One of the better places to come, but not the cheapest. The bison burger I had was $15+. I expected it though and enjoy the atmosphere. Yes you can bring your dogs here on the patio only. Will be coming back.< /text>

Excellent service. We loved the patio. An amazing selection of great food. Some of my party had specialty drinks and they enjoyed them. I was very pleased with the unusual and delicious menu offerings. Something for everyone with a definite cut above rating for ambiance and menu selections.< /text>

<review>Had a wonderful brunch with a group of 7. Food was excellent, and prices were quite reasonable. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is the service. I think we were seated in an area where no one was sure we were their table. Would definitely return though!<//review>< Pictures>

1st time going to this chain. Very good food and gracious management.  Made us feel very welcome. Ribs, fish 'n chips, and kid burgers were great. I loved the bbq sauce but found the bottle given to us on the table had gone a bit fermented. Waiter didnt bring more sauce just said he would mention it to whoever. We are definitely going back. Probably this week.< /text>

Good is good. I'm not a huge dinner eater, the French dip is great. Good beer selection. But if you happen to be there when they have a maple bacon old fashion, get it. Speaking of bacon just order the candy bacon app while your at it.</text>

Wow! Is all I can say. I haven't been this impressed with a restraunt in a while. I went on a Monday night so it wasn't too busy but I can see this place being packed on the weekends. Me and a friend shared the pizza and a couple side orders and it all tasted EXTREMELY good. Not only was it good but the food wasn't generic, although it was pizza, wings, and Mac and cheese which are basic foods each bite amazed me with a variety of flavors! Along with the great food the service was also on par, never did we have to ask for anything the server checked on us multiple times throughout the meal. Very happy with my experience and excited to go back to try the PB&K Burger!<//review>

Love this place!  Especially the weisswurst.  Hands down the best sausages I've had in the city.  The best thing is you can take em next door and have a great european beer in the local bar.  Lots on drafts.  You need to try this place.< /review>

I swing by after work for happy hour about every week and enjoy a drink or two as well as somethin to munch on from the happy hour menu. They have a good handful of TV's to enjoy a variety of different sport events on and the staff is fun and very attentive. Too many a time have I gone in for happy hour and hey caught up talking to the staff only to realize the several hours had passed without noticing. Looking forward to coming in many more times in the future! Cheers!< /Text>

Great food great prices. Most items appear to be made fresh. The ambiance is a bit loud but that's standard at a location such as this.

The hush puppies are delicious!

Fried green beans where very well cooked, not soggy and had a wonderful Asian flavor.

The three cheese pizza was perfectly cooked, perfect amount of dough and toppings.

The cocktails we tried were the seasonal ones and they were stiff and very flavorful.< /Text>

<review>First time here and I had a wonderful time. I came in and thought happy hour applied to the entire place but it’s just near the bar area and patio seating section. Thankfully I asked and they were very accommodating about us moving to the designated Happy Hour section and applied the prices to the drinks we had already placed. I don’t know if this was just me but I appreciated it very much.

The food was good but nothing to rave home about. My review is mostly based on the overall experience and the service of the staff. They were constantly checking in on us as expected even though it seemed busy, they made time.< /review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Time>

The service was top-notch and friendly. I had the Bison Meatloaf, a "house salad" and a passion-fruit iced-tea. The salad was twice as large as a normal side salad and was super fresh and delicious. The tea was unsweetened and not overpowering. The meatloaf did not disappoint. I will return soon to explore more of the menu.</text>

Should be called Lazy Cook.  Had one of the worst sandwiches I've ever had.  It was the French Dip on a soggy, mushy baguette roll.  Nearly tasteless, poorly seasoned beef.  Had to discard about 1/2 the sandwich, it was so bad.  First experience with this outfit, but probably the last.  Much better dining in this area.  AVOID!!</Review>

Bartender: what can I get you?
Me: do you have pickle juice for a pickle back?
Bartender: no, the kitchen does; but I can't leave the bar just to get it for you.
Me: I'll just take a whiskey neat then.
Me thinking: the bar doesn't have food either, but how does food prepared in the kitchen magically appear at the bar for other patrons? Hmmm... what kind of full service bar doesn't have pickle juice on-hand? I guess this place has mediocre mixologists that only serves fruity cocktails. The best answer would have been, "No, we don't have pickle juice." And let it be at that. Just finish your drink, talk your buddies into going elsewhere where you feel appreciated.<//Text>

The happy hour menu is very cheap and affordable.  There's not a lot of choices, but I like the burger,  wings, and buffalo chicken "lollipops" that they have.  I got 3 items for $16, which was great.   The only issue is that you have to sit at the bar or patio, which is fine with me.<//text>

Decided to try Lazy Dog's after passing it several times to go to another restaurant right next door. It is a very good place to bring kids and dogs. They have an outdoor patio specifically for dogs. The Bison burger was very good. And of course it's a great place for the kids, they always enjoy eating here.<//text>

I cannot say enough about the staff here. They are absolutely amazing! We have been having a rough 24 hours with our pooch Titus and decided to bring him here after the ER visit to help settle our nerves and get him some food as well. So many friendly people, including staff, were asking about our dog because the recent shavings he received are very noticeable. After we ate and asked for our bill, our waitress (I apologize for not remembering her name, kinda out of it with the sick pooch and all) told us that we were all set and everything was taken care of. This left us puzzled and she told us that the staff came together and they just wanted to take care of us. I cannot ever thank the employees of Lazy Dog enough for such amazing compassion and empathy during our extremely stressful time. They have made us customers for life and we will definitely be back, definitely while we still have Titus with us. Thank you guys for turning a very difficult time into an amazing one!< /Text>

Service was very slow. Food was not very tasty.
Should have sent food back or complained. Next time in area will go somewhere else.< /text>

<review>The happy hour menu is very cheap and affordable.  There's not a lot of choices, but I like the burger,  wings, and buffalo chicken "lollipops" that they have.  I got 3 items for $16, which was great.   The only issue is that you have to sit at the bar or patio, which is fine with me.< /review>< Date>

Good Ole American Fare. This is a good restaurant to get a burger and beer. But they also serve wine and offer a full bar. I do like how the burgers are half pound patties.<//review>

Probably my favorite restaurant in Tustin marketplace area. The menu has a great variety and the selections that I've made have all been delicious. Also great that you can bring your dog and sit on the patio.<//text>

Love this place! Always pretty good service. And the food is consistently great! Thai chicken salad is awesome, would highly recommend trying it!  Also I tried something different the other day, they have a bison meatloaf right now. And it's actually pretty good!<//review>

The food is always great, it can get a little crowded as sometimes the service is slow. I hate when I don't get refills like today and it wasn't busy because we went before  the dinner rush.<//Review>

Five stars for the food and 1 star for the beer selection.  Lazy Dog needs to get with the program and offer a range of strong porters and stouts.  There are tons of local breweries that make great beers like this.</review>

<user_name>Joshua Hudson</user_name><review>So not only was my to go order 20+ minutes late, the staff member was dismissive saying “oh we’re busy” and then rude.

Here’s the kicker and why I’m so upset. My order wasn’t 20 minutes late because the restaurant was busy, it was late because an item was missing and had to be prepared still. I get it, things happen. If the woman working the ToGo area had simply told me the truth there would have been no issue. Instead she chose to ignore me and then lie about why my order was late. This shows a complete lack of character on her part and a complete disregard for customers.

Absolutely amazing service! Everyone was energetic and nice! Fast service but I didn't feel rushed at all! Both managers on duty that evening came to our table to see how everything was. Overall, just an amazing experience,  I felt like I was at Mastro's or something with how wonderful the entire staff is there! Definitely will recommend and return, Lazy Dog EARNED a loyal customer last night.< /Text>

Excellent service!!!  A BIG THANK YOU to the management team at Lazy Dog in Irvine.  I was planning a Baby Reveal at the restaurant and Karim and Jake were very helpful in every way.  Karim kept in contact with me to help plan and acted as a liaison between all involved with excellent communication. The staff was very accommodating with all our requests.  The restaurant doesn't sing so Karim said he would try to get some of the staff to sing the song we wrote to the Happy Birthday tune, but I guess he and Jake couldn't get anyone to that, but that was the only thing they didn't do for us.  Thanks again to all involved, you guys are fantastic!< /text>

Only drawback is the Asian items tend to be just okay. Otherwise this rating would be five stars.

But overall I always look forward to coming here. The pot pie is a personal favorite, and a new favorite is the lunch menu chicken parm. Pro tip: order the chicken parm with a little Alfredo mixed into the marinara -- great flavor and didn't cost anything extra!< /text></record></dataset><record>

<review>This is a slightly pricier restaurant offering American fare, much along the lines of Cheesecake Factory. However, this restaurant has a cozier, friendlier feel. Maybe it has to do with their policy of allowing dogs to eat with you on the outside patio (none are allowed inside, so you can enjoy your food dog-allergy-free if that applies). In any case, their food options are solid. The pot roast and chicken pot pie come highly recommended. Service is excellent. Parking can be a bit tricky at peak meal times, and there can be a wait as well.</review>< resp>

Good beer variety, can take your pets, food is just ok. Customer service is average. What makes this spot different is that it's a chain restaurant where your pets are welcome.  PS if you like bacon, try the bacon candy<//review>

Trendy and relaxed. Sign on the wall: "Live like a cat, drink like a dog." You need to be a philosopher to grasp he deeper meaning here. As for the food, my chicken caesar salad was not of very good quality and quite small. Service was perfunctory.< /Text>

Served ice tea but was Annoyed when we asked for sweetener and straws which then took 15 mins. To arrive at our table.  Trust me we asked nicely.</review>< pics>

This is the stupidest policy I've ever heard. We didn't have masks so we walked across the street to BJs where we were seated and they didn't require masks.< /review>< pics>

<Text>This visit was just ok.  Orders the corn dog appetiser/small plate.  To heavy on the beer batter for my tastes.  I am used to lighter and fluffy of Der wienerschnitzel.  Also ordered the chicken parmesan lunch.  Flavors were a little flat.

Wow, what a place. Never been to one but we sure will be back. Manager sat us down and was very very nice and welcomed us and informed us of the menu items. Our waitress, Lauren was the sweetest thing ever and really was an excellent waitress (cute too!).  The IPA beer was a perfect match for the Sweet and spicy chicken.  So glad we stopped in.<//Text>

Popular (read: often lines on weekend evenings) bar and grill type joint. The bar is a good gathering spot for the after work and sports fan crowd. With cheap happy hour drinks and bites, a place that can easily turn into your regular drinking hole.</text>

Food was really good, and I absolutely love all the decor. We informed our waiter that we were going to split a dish and they were nice enough to divide the meal and present it very nicely.</Text>

<review>My family always enjoys going here. It's great if you have kids, as the ambient background noise level here is high. This is a wait-to-be-seated-and-order restaurant, so it's not for a quick bite. Also the prices are not cheap. Great place to go to celebrate family events.< /review><rating>5< /rating><pictures>None< /pictures>< user>

<Review>Their dessert selection was quite nice. I got the Chicken Poblano. It tastes like tamales and was really good. The dresser option I got was a Root Beer Float and a Butter Bread. So good. They also accommodated my dog and he was stuffed with the hamburger patty and rice. Will come again.</Review>< pics>

<Review>The mojitos were delicious, the four us ordered something different and shared the flavours. The sticky ribs were Smokey sweet and just a bit tangy😙 the chicken pot pie was a perfect home run as was the braised pork shoulder and the flat iron steak cooked to tender perfection. All topped of with their peach crumble ala mode. Great job guys!< /Review><user_name>Sticky Gobbs< /user_name>< Rating>

Average food with mediocre service.
I've been many times and it's stayed true to form. The atmosphere is really pretty cool its always fun to see the different dogs that are there. However, that really only goes so far. The food has never been "bad", but I've never had excellent either. Seasoning, doneness, temperature, something is always just not quite right. Not enough to complain about, but never where you're excited about what you just got either. As for the service, I don't know if they have too much rotation or just hire the servers that aren't on their A-game, but again it's never quite what you expect. Either they walk by you several times when you're drinks are empty, they don't know the menu, or just seem too busy... Will I go back again? Yeah, I'm sure I will. But it's never at the top of my list, it's more like "well, we could go to Lazy Dog, we haven't been in awhile".<//Text>

I had the teriyaki bowl and it was great. For dessert I had their lemon cake with the huckleberry sauce, which was the right combination of sweetness and tart tastes</Review>

< Review>
The entire staff is poorly trained and the food is mediocre. Their gluten-sensitive menu is great if you eat a lot of meat. The service was terrible and while the staff is constantly running around, we could not get any refills on any drinks or even dessert. A very disappointing evening.< /Review>

Their dessert selection was quite nice. I got the Chicken Poblano. It tastes like tamales and was really good. The dresser option I got was a Root Beer Float and a Butter Bread. So good. They also accommodated my dog and he was stuffed with the hamburger patty and rice. Will come again.< /Review>

<Review>Any place that loves dogs as much as I do is ok with me. Wait staff are friendly and accommodating, food is very good and plentiful. What is really impressive is that the wait time from ordering and getting the food on the table is extremely short. Good place.</Review>< user>

I'm not saying to avoid it but I would say to have realistic expectations. It's not the Craft Brewery and restaurant type of place it may sound like it is.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None</Response>< Gmap_id>

Delicious food with a welcoming atmosphere and of course the patio outside for your friendly pup. I love that they change their menu to add seasonal flavors throughout the year but the traditional Classics never go away.</text>< time>

<Review>Sunny side up pizza for brunch IS NOT WHAT it used to be!!  We always come here for that and it's always been excellent!  The spinach dip that used to be on the base is gone.  The sun dried tomatoes- gone.  Lots less bacon than before.  And now they added red bell peppers instead.  Not loving it.

< Review>
A fun place to visit with the dogs and eat on the porch.  Love their spicy edamame.  Place is a little too crowded and loud for me during their busy Friday/Saturday evenings, but a fun place to visit for lunch or snacks.  Prices are average and on par with what  you'd get at similar places.< /Review>

< Review>
Service was good after we waited 35 min when they told us 20. The new menu may be good overall but I tried the Lemon Caper Chicken and it was horrible. Fortunately our server took it off our bill, but was very disappointed that it didn't have much flavor.< /Review>

Large outdoor patio to promote their fun concept of allowing customers to bring their dogs. Food is pretty good, better than other chains such as Chili's or TGIF. They also have happy hour!< /Text>

I tried a different menu item this time, and for the first time I was somewhat disappointed.   I tried a dish of chicken and vegetables.   My first disappointment was that it was cold.  I liked my raw vegetables cold, but I wanted my chicken hot, but it was cold also.  Other than that,  everything else was excellent as expected.</review>

<Review>Decent Lazy Dog. Patio is small, bathrooms were filthy.
Food is nothing special, the Lazy Dog in Orange is much better.
Only thing good here were the staff and water.
Compared to the Orange location this place sucks.</Review>< user_name>

<Text>I tried a different menu item this time, and for the first time I was somewhat disappointed.   I tried a dish of chicken and vegetables.   My first disappointment was that it was cold.  I liked my raw vegetables cold, but I wanted my chicken hot, but it was cold also.  Other than that,  everything else was excellent as expected.< /Text><GmapID>0x80dcdb808573fff5:0xae76d2b0c6ab747d</GmapID><Time>1510296309044<//Time>< pictures>

Food is nothing special, the Lazy Dog in Orange is much better.
Only thing good here were the staff and water.
Compared to the Orange location this place sucks.</Review>< Pictures>

The food is average and the price of the check made my eyes explode when I got the bill. For the same cost of what I got I could of gone to benihana and got the samurai treat with fillet mignon and hibatchi shrimp and it would of felt more worth the cost.< /Review>

Very nice flavor and drinks in this restaurant, the atmosphere and service are also great. Price is a bit high but seems to be ok given the quality. They usually are playing nice music for a late dinner; which is also a plus since most restaurants close so early in the irvine area.</text>

Lazy Dog is a great place to grab a beer, some food and watch a sporting event. The food is much better than even the best pub or bar food, the staff is always great and the atmosphere pleasant!</Text>

<review>We were seated within 5 minutes, it seemed busy too. Ordered our appetizer and 2 entrees and it arrived within 15 mins. Fast friendly servise. The manager gave us free cheesy flat bread for out first time there and another manager gave us a coupon for free desert or appetizer on our next visit. The waitress was quick and consistent as weel. Just to top off the night, our way out a bust boy, who has no reason to look our direction, told us to have a good night. Fantastic, impressive service. Thank you Lazy Dog.< /review>< user_id>

<review>This particular restaurant has above average service. When it gets busy the service level on things like refills, clearing your table, getting your check declines. But generally it is good. Servers typically are smiling and friendly and always smiling.

They have a very varied menu. Tons of things to select from and interesting unique items as well. They put unique touches on things such as the quesadilla where they brown the cheese on the outside of the tortilla in addition to the filling.

I think they have some of the best fish and chips around. Nice thick pieces of cod. The cole slaw and fries are great too with this dish. The other item I love is the breaded pork chop.

Their corn wheel seasonal appetizer is great. Like getting Mexican street corn (elotes)

Nice ambiance and you can bring your dog to sit outside and dine on the patio< /review>< Pics>

Any place people can bring their dog and eat is disgusting. The place has a big bar if you're a drunk and has alot of junk food if you don't care about your health.</Review>

Love Lazy Dog!! Excellent food (the pot roast is my Favorite!!), Excellent service (our server was Awesome!! ...although I just blanked on his name, so I'll have to get back to you), and all around Excellent vibe and atmosphere! Always look forward to any chance I have to go to Lazy, and I've never been disappointed! Tonight there was 5 of us for dinner and Everyone loved the choices they made. I had the pot roast of course, another had the fettuccine Alfredo with chicken and shrimp, someone else had the Black and Blue pizza, one had the sundried tomato chicken pasta (not sure the real name of it), and one had the hushpuppies. Sooooo  yummy!! ...Oh, and we also shared an order of Brussels sprouts. Mmmmm!! ....Only complaint is that I'm so full now!! :-/< /Review>

<review>I've been there 3 times and really enjoy the atmosphere and food. I love the blue cheeseburger. My drive is about 45 minutes so I don't go as often as I would like. Recently found out there is one in Rancho Cucamonga now. Which is only 15 minutes from me but the reviews are bad. So I guess I will keep making that drive for my favorite burger.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>

We have a dog and we used to walk here all the time, but we had a number of bad experiences and haven't been back. I think the biggest deterrent is the inconsistency of their drinks. We had some awful margaritas once (I know it's not a Mexican place but margaritas aren't that difficult to make), and their signature cocktails are never the same from one visit to the next. If we're going out for dinner, drinks are an important part of the experience.<//text>

It was my first time there, I didn't like the food either the waitress service, the taste of the wings that I have ordered was fine "as spices", but the quality of the chicken was the worst. I went there because one of my friends invited me, it was fun but I don't think I would do it again .< /review>

Cool thing about this place is that you can bring your dog on the patio (they welcome dogs with water bowls in the patio) the food is ok but pricey for regular type of food.<//Text>

< Review>
I took my wife for a lunch at the restaurant last weekend, this is maybe the 5th. or 6th. time to go there, but it will be the last for sure.  We waited for about 20 minutes to be seated which is fine as they looked quite busy. But we were seated outside as requested but we were seated in the sun. My wife asked the waiter to see if we could be moved to another table that had just become vacant and Seth the waiter was very polite and moved us to the shady table.  He came after a few minutes and said that we might have to move back to the other table because he was told by his manager to send us back as that table was going to be giving to a different party and we may have move back to the table in the sun.  He came back again and told us that we COULD stay as he "fought for us".  I really did not like the idea I called the manager and told him that as a courtesy to the customer they should have kept their seating problem away from the customer I did not have to feel any stress because of their seating situation, he said that he was going to let us stay on the current table in a tune made me feel that he was doing us a favor!! I told him that he was not doing me any favor. And to be honest this may not sound a big deal, but we both felt awkward and were not going to stay if we were told we had to move back.
We are not going back to this location, but we love the location in Orange as well as Brea

Ordered hush puppies, poke and black and blue pizza. Maybe we ordered bad but we didn't like any of it. The pizza was just oily, the Hush puppies are bland and the poke the ahi was over dressed.< /Text>

Ordered hush puppies, poke and black and blue pizza. Maybe we ordered bad but we didn't like any of it. The pizza was just oily, the Hush puppies are bland and the poke the ahi was over dressed.< /Text>

(Translated by Google) A nice place and very well decorated, but a regular service and I had some baby back ribs with barbecue. Which are the worst I've eaten were as boiled and then fried and finally with a barbecue that had no flavor. And they made a mistake in the drink I ordered.

A place without a doubt to come only once.

Un lugar bonito y muy bien decorado, pero un servicio regular y yo comí unas costillas baby back con barbacoa. Las cuales son las peores que me e comido estaban como hervidas y despues fritas y por ultimo con una barbacoa que no tenia sabor.  Y se equivocaron en la bebida que pedi.

Un lugar sin duda para venir solo una vez.
