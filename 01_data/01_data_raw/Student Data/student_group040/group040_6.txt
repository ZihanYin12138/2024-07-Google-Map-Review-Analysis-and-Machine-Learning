<Time>1613021869672< /Time><rate>5</rate><text>After previously visiting a different repair shop and getting a $150 estimate to have my phone’s charging port fixed, I decided to get a second opinion from iPhone Repair Hospital. After explaining what the phone’s problem was, the lady at the front desk took my phone and had it fixed two minutes later...Yes!!! Best of all FREE of charge! She explained, all the charging port needed was a cleaning to get rid of some lint. I found these people to be very honest, polite and respectful of my money. Will definitely go back to them with any other phone/tablet issues.</text><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

My daughter took her phone to get repaired here based off of prior reviews. She's had it four months with the new screen and it has lifted, and now her phone doesn't work at all. She took it in yesterday to be replaced and they did not do it due to a "scratch" that is on the screen that cannot been seen unless it's under a bright light! To say we are disappointed in the service is an understatement! We didn't even want a new screen we simply wanted it fixed or tightened. I will never recommend this place to anyone again. Please make sure they tell you about their real 6 month warranty (none) if you go here.<//Text>

My daughter shattered the screen on her iPhone 6s. We brought it into the shop and it was fixed in 40 minutes,for a reasonable price. The gentleman there was super friendly, he even replaced a piece of the phone that was missing free of charge. I recommend this store 100%.</text>

Had my iPhone X screen replaced here. I wasn’t sure which replacement screen was the best for this model. They explained the difference between the available replacement screens, and did not try to sell me on the most expensive screen. They were honest and made sure to walk me through everything involved in replacing the screen properly. I was extremely happy with the work performed, the efficiency of the work, and the pricing. I would strongly recommend this Company, they went above and beyond in my opinion. I will definitely be using them for any needed repairs in the future.<//Text>

<Review>I had to give a rating otherwise I would have given 0. Took my daughter’s iPhone 7 Plus in and had the screen replaced. They broke the front camera when replacing it said that it was already broken when it wasn’t. Well a few days later the phone stopped working and they have a 6 month guarantee. Said the phone was water damaged and not the screen. Well my brother in law does repairs as well. I had him look at it and said the screen was the issue and there was no visible water damage. They didn’t honor their warranty and lied about the phone being water damaged. I won’t ever go back there.< /Review><user_id>112260682957780526005<//user_id>< username>

{'time': 1579548448513, 'text': 'We are sorry you were not satisfied with your experience at the iPhone repair hospital. Unfortunately we do not cover any liquid damage and it does void the warranty. There are white sticker indicators in every iPhone that turn red when exposed to liquid or moisture. When we did the initial repair on 9-19-19 none of these stickers were triggered, unfortunately when the phone was brought back on 9-30-19 with the screen not working all the stickers were triggered and there was a small amount of liquid behind the lcd. According to our records when the phone was first brought in we were asked to check the front facing camera because it wasn’t functional. The camera was physically damaged from before the repair so we made a note of it on the receipt because we were not approved to replace the camera. Customer service and running our family business honestly is our priority and extremely important us, sadly there was nothing more we could do. We strive to take care of our customers to the best of our ability and are very sad when we cannot do anything further in situations like this.\nSincerely iPhone Repair Hospital'}</resp>

The screen on my iphone 6 plus died on me randomly, I had no idea what was wrong with it so I took it to Tori down at the iphone repair hospital and she diagnosed and fixed it in no time! The same day! And for cheap! They saved me from having to buy a new phone! So happy! I would reccomend them to anyone and everyone!<//Review>

Took my phone in to see if camera focus problem could be fixed. I know they spent a good amount of time trying various hardware fixes, but the problem ended up not being hardware but software based. They did not take any money for their efforts. Amazing! This place is the best, and I can't recommend it highly enough.<//review>

I have been going to iPhone Repair Hospital for awhile now. I carry their cards with me because of the service, pricing and how I am treated. I try to keep my business in town with the local businesses because I don’t feel like “take a number and we will call it sometime today or tomorrow”. They normally fix my phones while I wait or I pick them up within the hour. We have a lot of phones and now I have quit paying the insurance on all of them because the iPhone Repair Hospital can generally fix them cheaper when it’s all said and done and I’m not without a phone for a week and NO monthly charge. Add up the money you pay for the insurance and all the hassle they put you through and you will see you will save money. They also carry many things that you can’t find at the large phone stores. I don’t write reviews very often because I get terrible service from people that don’t have interest after the sale. I can’t express how warm and friendly they are and go above and beyond to get the job done. The next time you have a problem with your phone I would ask that you do yourself a favor and give them a try and then give a review. I know you will be as happy as I’ve been.</Text>

<Text>So I have a month old iPhone 5s, I end up letting it slip off the end of the sink and it was completely submerged in water for a couple seconds, I thought my phone was broken for sure and thought I was going to have to drag myself up to the apple store and pay a hefty price to get my 5s fixed... WRONG found this place and boy am I glad I did, not only was it fixed and like brand new but! for only 40 dollars, I don't know anywhere else that will do it this cheap. they saved me a few hundred dollars, The owners/people were very nice and helpful and to make things even better they stayed open later just so I could come get it. I will be taking all my apple products here from now on.< /Text>< Pics>

They say I'm hard on cell phones so iPhone Repair Hospital has become my "go to place" when I need a repair.  Every time I've needed a repair they have fixed my phone the very same day.  And their prices make it an easy decision to repair it instead of replace it.  My advice - go to them first.<//Review>

<Review>I shattered the screen on my I phone so first thing I did was call IPhone Repair Hospital. I have taken an ipad to Joe in the past and he did a wonderful job. I went Monday afternoon and the wait to get my phone fixed was only about 45 mins. Best of all Joe had a special going on so It was quick, easy, priced extremely reasonable and my phone was a good as new. If you need you screen replaced don't live with the cracks just go see Joe and he will take are you. He also gave me a new app to check out! Thanks IPhone Repair Hospital!!!<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None<//resp><Gmap_id>0x809107ac42640c41:0x4136237d93f26e25< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Apparently iPhone's do not bounce!  This is especially true in regards to cement.  But... luckily there is a little place in Turlock that is fast, friendly, and affordable.  Highly recommended! Finished replacing the screen in about 15 minutes - looks brand new!< /text>

I needed to get my iPad screen replaced. They were $50 cheaper than the other place in town and the customer service was excellent. He had my iPad looking good as New in a little over an hour. I highly recommend them!</review>

I went here to get my Iphone screen replaced after having it done somewhere else.  The first place tried multiple times and left me with a screen I couldn't see with sunglasses on and a button that didn't click.  The guys at the Iphone repair Hospital repaired my phone for 50% cheaper than the other place and its as good as new.  I recommend only using them for your iphone repairs.</review>

<review>iPhone Repair Hospital was superb!  I took my iPhone in since it had "dead spots" on the screen since the last repair at another shop.  He told me it would cost me $39 and that I could pick the phone up in 30 min.  I came back 30 minutes later but he only charged me $20.  He informed me that the last guy that replaced the screen did not connect it correctly and he did not use the correct glue and that was the reason for the dead spots on the screen.  What a class act!  He could have charged me the full amount and I would have not known the difference.  The phone works great now and I was really impressed with the professionalism, the expertise and the honesty of this guy.  I highly recommend him to anyone who has any issues with iPhones, iPads etc...</review><pics>None</pics><response>None<//response>< Gmap_id>

Took in my ipod, some of the LCD screen went black. I was able to replace my ipod with a white screen instead of the original black (love it!!) and you're also able to replace it with a white screen, black button. I had it done within the same day :). Thanks!<//review>

< Review>
I called around a bit before dropping into iPhone Repair Hospital and to be be honest i planned on asking a few questions and coming back after i check out a couple other repair options for my daughters iPod Touch (4th Gen). But the Owner's knowledge of the issue and professional manner made me feel comfortable enough to just pull the trigger and take care of the issue right then and there.  The estimated time was and hour but i need it done ASAP and he got it done in almost half that!
I was extremely pleased with his work and would recommend him to everybody needing apple repairs.  You may find cheaper service via craigslist but those people aren't professionals, this Man knows his business and knows it well.  He has genuine products in stock and his demeanor will give you confidence in his work.

Thanks iPhone Repair Hospital, My daughter was stoked about her new screen and new Color!< /Review>

<user>108185346606977619939<//user><response>None< /response><Text>Looking for a place to get an iPhone or iPod repaired without getting ripped off can be a daunting task to say the least.  I am extremely glad I came across this business during my google search.  Brought two iPod touches in to repair cracked screens.  Every other place I had called quoted minimum $180 and a week to repair (none had screens in stock).  When I called he said he could repair both for $120 and it would be done in 2 hours.  Well I was sold.  When I brought them in he was extremely knowledgeable on what the problem was and how to repair the iPods.  2 hours later my iPods were ready and he even spruced up one of them by changing the screen to white but leaving the black button (does this on request) which looks awesome.  Any future problems I have with my Apple toys are headed to this shop.  Oh and he also has custom colored screens for iPods and iPhones ($99) so if you are tired of your white or black screen go custom with a purple, yellow or green one.< /Text><Rate>5<//Rate>< Gmap_id>

Professional, Courteous, Honest and Friendly, and all of the other words that describe a great business. A nice little shop, very friendly and informative, he fixed my iPhone screen in about a half hour. I waited while he did the repair. He was kind enough to hook me up with a white face with a black home button which looks really nice and unique. He swagged up my iPhone with the nice colorway recommendation and I am very pleased. I am sure I will be doing business here again many times. I am one who is very much into electronics and in turn always breaking electronics :) I recommend this shop to anyone looking for a great repair shop when it comes to their Iphone or smartphone, and the list doesn't stop there! They fix xbox's, (red ring of death) smartphones, iphones, and a whole bunch more stuff! Just give him a call or stop on by, he was very helpful on the phone, and even cooler to talk to in person. I am so stoked i found this repair shop/jewel in Turlock! I am sure i will be frequenting his shop in the future. I am pretty sure they are the only place that fixes iphones in Turlock. Even if they aren't the only place, you will not go wrong by going to the iPhone Repair Hospital. A Plus Plus Plus Plus Plus PLUS!!!! 100% satisfaction! :]< /text>

<review>Tech Jay Magana was professional and took the time to explain everything he was doing and why. I decided to upgrade the service I was getting done and he stayed and got it done. Easy to get an appointment set up, tech showed up on time, and work was completed quick. The air conditioner is working great. Truly appreciate the awesome work this company did.</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures></record></dataset><record>

Instead of “selling” the most profitable services, he suggested to do the most cost effective option first, if not working, then go to next option. And it works. I will definitely call nexgen and ask for Ruben when I need AC services next time.<//Text>< rating>

I made an appointment online on a Sunday since my AC went out.the appointment was for the next day. An hour after I made the appointment an associate called me to confirm a time. Made the appointment. They emailed me and texted me confirmations of the appointment. The time changed and then they notified me again. They are very good communicators.
The technician showed up with gear and a tablet. Went to the ac unit , checked all my ac related equipment, and then discussed with me 5 priced out solutions for the repair. From 1-5 was most expensive to least expensive cost scenarios. I chose the cheapest solution of course, and the technician Brandon Alvarez, didn’t push us or try to up sell us at all. He was great and very nice. He fixed our Broken AC that same day in like 30 minutes!<//text>

Amazing fast response.   Same day and the technician was knowledgeable, polite, clean and efficient. In miserably hot weather we had cool air the same day. He carefully explained our options so we could make knowledge based decisions.< /Review>

<Review>Would highly recommend NexGen to service your AC/Heating.  Shaun arrived before the scheduled time and did a thorough evaluation of our heater and air conditioner (he called to ask if it was ok to come sooner).  He explained what he did, the results and what is needed to keep the system working properly.  He wore a mask and booties the entire time he was in the house.  He is a great ambassador for NexGen.  Would definitely call them for any future AC/Heating needs.

<text>I had my AC replaced and the system is awesome and I believe that this company takes pride in their work and respect the concerns from the customer.  I did not feel pressured in purchasing the system and have not had any problems with the unit.  I did not replace my heater at the same time, and what a big mistake.  So now I also have purchased the heating unit (two years later) and was grateful when the technician came out so quickly when the carrier heating unit was making noises and the fan would not shut off.  The crew that came out replaced the heater and I am thankful they did this quickly.  If I did not have the technician come out there could have been a possible injury to my house or to me.  The company is very professional and are there to answer your questions or concerns.  I am happy we went with this company.< /text>< date>

In May, our water heater stopped working. The technician came out and ‘fixed’ it. UBut in a little over a month, the exact same problem happened. Clemente came out this time. He was courteous and made sure to identify the real problem. He is going to order the parts and come out next week to replace the part that caused the problem in the beginning. NexGen should send out technicians like him.< /Text>

< Review>
Our A/C was not cooling our house.  The furnace was running but the condenser outside was not turning on outside.  It did turn on the day prior but it was later in the day and it was over 80 degrees in the house.  It ended up being a faulty capacitor, which they were able to replace within 10 minutes and we were able to have a cool home!< /Review>

Our AC wouldn't turn on  it was a Sunday late afternoon. So glad we took our chances on calling Nexgen for our issue. They had someone over and ready to work within the hour. Aaron did a terrific job was comfortable with dogs and quickly found the problem. Price was fair for to super service they provide are AC was on an running when the same day. Thank you Nexgen<//Review>

NexGen sent out a service technician within a day of our service request. The technician, Roger Cuadra, was extremely thorough in assessing our unit and explaining his findings, as well as giving his recommendations for keeping it running efficiently and prolonging its life.  I highly recommend NexGen, and more specifically Roger.</review>

Jorge was very nice, on time, professional and very informative. But the bottom line is that Nexgen is about 35% more expensive than other air conditioning companies, according to my research. I've had three in person estimates now and two phone consults.
I would be hard pressed to afford them.< /Review>

<review>Sal did a wonderful job for us. He tested our unit and fixed the problem. He explained everything and gave numerous options. We will definately be doing some of the upgrades he suggested.

<Rate>5< /Rate><Review>Plumbing issue in kitchen. Another well known company came, could not fix, and even recommended incorrect services. JOSE diagnosed the real issue (clog at island side, not main sink, used camera and long snake and gasket to fix. ) with a 5 star film shoot, and pressure from director, problem solved.

Patrick repaired my AC unit instead of trying to sell me a new Trane unit.  When my old unit finally dies, I will buy a new highly rated Goldman unit from NexGen for half the price of a Trane unit.  They earned my business.<//text>

<date>1565476259097<//date><rate>5< /rate><Text>Nexgen was a referral from a trust friend; nevertheless, we still did our due diligence and got other bids.

Here are the reasons I particularly loved Nexgen:
- Most of the bids we received came back with less than desirable feedback/quotes on adding A/C to our central heating - there was only one place who had a significantly cheaper quote. However, it was Nexgen who took the time to explain why it was going to be more complex than just adding in A/C (having to do with the location of our heaters) and therefore more expensive, and continued to explain that if they put in our A/C, they want to make sure it's right and not done poorly.
- The installation team was extremely professional, knowledgeable, clean, and were very timely in getting answers to questions they didn't know.
- The A/C works great!< /Text>< Pictures>

<review>I am furious and I will NEVER call or recommend you for anything.
Dan seemed more concerned about selling me a new heating unit then fixing my existing unit. He did go on the roof and checked the heating system. He concluded that there was nothing wrong with my unit but my thermostat and charged me 265.00 dollars on my debit card for a thermostat. Excessive but I was desperate.
The heater began working but then it stopped working. He went back on the roof, came back and told me this story about how corroded my unit was and that I really needed to get it replaced. Dan also told me not to run the heating system because it was so corroded and my disabled brother and I could risk inhaling carbon monoxide fumes. He was a good salesman. He wanted to set up a meeting with a supervisor and I initially agreed until that night when I came to my senses and cancelled.
I had a reputable heating business come out and they looked at the limit stick that Dan said fell off in his hand, and found that Dan broke it. They also said that I didn’t need to replace the unit and that the limit stick that Dan broke they can replace. Oh Dan also told me that it was going to cost 3,000-4,0000 dollars to repair my system which was a LIE!
I am furious. Our electricity bill will now be astronomical thanks to Dan and that my disabled brother suffering from Huntington’s Disease that I had to keep him warm with expensive space heaters from Home Depot because he is unable to regulate his body temperature! He MUST stay warm!
I want my  ALL OF MY MONEY refunded to me and the thermostat should be given to me from all the hell you all put me through.
I am definitely reporting  you to the BBB and posting this on YELP! This is ridiculous!!< /review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>{'time': 1546636693038, 'text': 'Hello, I am sorry to hear about this experience. We will be reaching out to you to make this right.

Randy and Travis explained everything and went right to work. This was a complete instal of heating and air conditioning from scratch.Oh it was 101' that day in the valley they did not complain once about going into the attic. Many things they did and most impressive is the company Nexgen pulls a permit for the installation. so you know you're receiving the most qualified workmanship in the industry. To my surprise and happiness they completed the job in one day. They removed the asbestos  installed all new ducting and wired the entire units. everything is up to code. This is a big company who takes care of their family which to me is extremely important. Thank you very much and yes i would and have recommended you to my family and friends. robert<//Text>

James and the Nexgen air guys saved me a small fortune!

One of my AC units was not working.  The first company I called looked at the unit (which is in a somewhat difficult spot to service) and immediately told me I needed to replace both units for around $8,000.  Ouch!   I called Nexgen for a second opinion.  The service tech James arrived on time and gladly pulled up all the deck boards he needed to in order to service the unit.  He quickly discovered the capacitor had blown.  $300 repair and done in under an hour.

Can't speak highly enough of these guys!<//text>

<Review>Awesome! My old, scrapped together system my dad put in the house went out and i needed a whole new system. I called Nexgen and they came out the same day to inspect it and had someone out the next day to tell me what i needed and 5 guys showed the very next morning. Wow! And this was during summer. Buy the end of the day it was done. New condenser, heating unit and coil plus all new ducting. The best part, they hauled all the old stuff away so i didnt have to deal with it. They even had to reconstruct the closet it was in. Excellent!< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>{'time': 1536189090000, 'text': "Thank you so much for this fantastic review, C!

They did an amazing job. They were able to let us know about the changes that needed to be done to better our system in the home. The techs got the job done in one day.

Dennis Rulli and Louis Reveles were Absolutely amazing. It was time for a new HVAC and air handler unit, which is a big decision, and they walked me through the and entire process,  explained my options without any sales pressure. VERY accommodating and have already referred them to a family friend. Thanks again guys!!<//Review>

<Review>We had call our local Air conditioner service company and was blown off two years in a row for a maintenance call.  My husband had seen the ad for NexGen and we called and made an appointment.  Mario came out and was very nice, clean and knowledgable of his job. Didn't try to sell us a new unit ( 12 years old) he fixed the part and educates us on our filters. We are NexGen customer for life!  Thank you Mario and your company. ... we our one "cool" customer!!!!</Review>< pics>

I just love Dr. Tina. She is funny, kind and very knowledgeable. I would highly recommend Dr. Tina for that hometown touch; she takes the time to communicate solutions. Which in today’s medical climate, spending time with each patient is dictated by a meter. However, not  Dr. Tina, she is on her very own schedule because she is extremely thorough.

Love Dr. Tina. Listens well. Takes me seriously. Speaks honestly and directly to problems and medical issues. Specific and trustworthy. She’s the only doctor I’ve ever had who seems to remember me and my allergies between appointments... which means she actually reads my chart. Can’t tell you how rare that is. Love her.< /Review>

No need to jump through unnecessary hoops to find a diagnosis, most times she is able to tell you what the issue is just based on your initial visit and she hits the nail on the head every time.

I've been seeing Dr Tina for 21 yrs. She's the best Dr I've ever had. She always gets down to the bottom of things and has me feeling better quickly. Always looking out for me. Dr Tina got me through a very hard time in my life. And I will always be thankful to her for caring about me and my health. A+ Dr and would recommend her to anyone.<//Review>

I have been a patient of all the doctors’ Agresti’s over the past 20+ years. Currently Dr. Linda Agresti is my doctor.  She and her friendly and helpful staff provide me excellent care. I never feel rushed. She listens well which I think is key to a great doctor!<//Text>

<text>I have complete faith in Dr. Tina Agresti's office and have been a patient for 20+ years. She does run a little behind sometimes, but that is because she actually takes the time to listen to my issue(s) and explain what needs to be done to get me back to optimal health.

Dr Agresti sees the whole person and not just the symptoms of the problem.  Since I have been her patient, 8 years now, I receive preventative care and explanations of what to watch out for.  I just respect her values and work ethic.

Because I trust Dr Agresti, I have chosen to have her remain my primary physician even though I have recently moved.  This is because when I call her office and ask for help, she makes herself available the very same day.  She knows me and I never feel like I am bothering her.  She genuinely does her job with great pride and my health reaps the benefits of that.</Text>

<review>I always receive excellent care from Sierra Rise Family Practice. As a microbiologist, I'm extremely picky about my healthcare providers. SRFP meets my requirements for that role.

I cannot say enough good things about Dr Tina Agresti who is always available if not in the office but by phone. During the Pandemic I was very ill for another reason, Dr Tina worked with me and I came through that illness episode in a positive way. We are both up front speakers and lay it out in order to be sure we are understood. Thanks sooo much Dr Tina.</review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

Dr. Linda Agresti is very thorough.  She anticipates problems or issues beforehand so that you can make changes to protect your health.</Text>

<time>1593208589629</time><rate>5<//rate><review>Dr. Tina was my physician when i was a child. When I turned 21 and i was kicked off my parents insurance my employer at the time only offered kaiser. I was misdiagnosed by Kaiser physicians for over 10 years. Once I got married I was able to go back to Serria Rose Family physician's. Dr. Tina was absolutely amazing she totally understood my faith and trust in Doctor's was lost while Kaiser misdiagnosed my gullbladder disease for over 10 years, which has left me with permanent complications. I have also seen Dr. Linda, she is just as wonderful of a person and Doctor as Dr. Linda! The current staff at Sierra Rose Family physician's office is absolutely AMAZING. Kelly and Megan in the front office are so lovely and empathetic to patients who aren't feeling well.. which that's a big deal for me the front office staff is the first impression patients see and interact with. Gina, who is  Dr. Tina's most important assistant to me, will really work hard dealing with your insurance company if something isn't right and if you have to be reffered out to see a specialist she takes care of it! There isn't enough good things I can say about Sierra Rose Family physician's and staff. Due to some of my chronic health issues I have at least 1 doctor appt a month, Dr. tina and her staff have become very special people to me.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

If you desire genuine caring Medical Primary Doctors; that are relentless in ensuring that the well-being of your health is their number one priority. Then you want to be with the Agresti's. I can truly say from all my employment experiences with Primary Physicians, that I have never seen such true, selfless dedication to the patients' well-being like the Agresti's exercise daily on tasks. It's no secret, that the wait time could be monotonous. However, it is a certainty that proficient, genuinely caring Physicians like Dr. Tina Agresti and Dr. Linda Agresti are the true embodiment of what Healthcare should portray. You should count yourself lucky and proud to have them standing by your sides as your PCPs. It was an honour working for the Agresti's. God continue to bless them with great Divine Health and give them strength to continue to enrich lives with their unrivaled professionalism. Sincerely, Victoria Phillip.< /Text>

<Text>While I no longer live in the area and have different medical coverage, Sierra Rose and Dr. E. Agresti and his sisters were awesome and always helped me to resolve any medical issues I had. They were great. Though it has been 3 or 4 years since I've been their patient, I find it incredibly difficult to imagine their service and expertise doing anything but getting better.<//Text><userid>109612178951004524974<//userid>< name>

North Star is a very great school. It provides a good environment for students to learn. Although people might have a few complaints, they are very lucky to attend such a terrific school. The school provides many extra curricular activities such as art programs, music programs and after school and lunch time clubs. In my experience students feel very safe and enjoy going here. Many people meet friends here that they will have for the rest of their lives. The teachers try their best to make learning fun and enjoyable for the students. There might be a lot of work and high exceptions sometimes but the teachers are just trying to better prepare you for the future. Teachers give the amount of homework that necessary for the class. Every student here should feel blessed to attend a school were teachers really want the best for their students.< /text>

We count our blessings every day that our kids were able to get into this unique school. We drive from San Mateo to attend, and it's worth it. After experiencing bullying, disruptive classes, and minimal oversight in public middle school with one child and teaching to the lowest common denominator in grade school for the other, it is so refreshing to attend North Star Academy.  The kids are unique and focused and the school caters to that kind of student. The principal sets the stage early, expectations are high, and the education is outstanding.  Another bonus is it's 3rd-8th grade so the "middle school shuffle" is non-existent.<//Review>

<Rating>4< /Rating><Text>There are good teachers and bad ones. The teachers give a lot of homework everyday. The teachers that don't give a lot of homework don't teach a lot. The middle school math program is bad, because everything is repetitive. There is an enrichment program with study hall, but the system for who goes into what enrichment is biased, so I often have to stay up very late to complete assignments. Also, the bathrooms are dirty. But it is also a good school. Many teachers are really nice. The learning environment is relaxing. There are many activities you can participate in, like music and enrichment. There is an art program where you learn about art. I have had a lot of fun at this school. We go on many fun field trips. You will find good and bad things in every school, but this school has many good things. This is an honest review and is just my opinion so don't attack me. I have finally finished this review so I won't edit it anymore.< /Text>< Pictures>

This school is very nice all of the teachers are nice and they want to help you get better also office staff are very nice. Lunch thing is not the best thing but it is ok, the PE teachers are kinda mean but new teachers are coming lately so lots of new nice faces have to take a test to get in but other than that it is a very nice school.</Review>

< Review>
honestly the only takeaway from this being a perfect school is mckinley. Always ruining our reputation and stuff and i always see 3rd graders getting surrounded by other mckinley kids. I just hate people who gang up on others. And also they're always using their phones during lunch and recess and pretty much whenever they can, which is also kin of annoying. Honestly I could be wrong but I also kinda feel like North Star would be a much better school if we didn't share with mckinley.< /Review>

Class of 2019 (Connor Williams)

North Star Academy (NSA) is an amazing school and I went there from 3rd-8th grade. The community is very nice and all the teachers are very friendly and understanding. Principal Sara Shackel is an amazing principal, being both joyful and helping to improve the school. She has always listened to the emails I have sent complaining and offering suggestions about improving a specific situation at school, and does a great job dealing with conflicts between students.

The school stands out in may ways, including an enrichment program which starts in 4th grade, which is essentially an elective class. Some classes include going deep into math, composing music, learning to code, creating the yearbook (middle school), and helping run school events. This school helps ease the transition to middle school from it's rigorous elementary school curriculum, which is featured with learning all about fractions and negative numbers, doing the freedom project, and doing the science fair, with the latter two involving making a trifold. There are numerous field trips taken during the elementary grades, the most notable being the gold rush and outdoor ed field trips, which are 2 and 4 night field trips, respectively. These field trips are filled with excitement, adventure, and education. Middle school features the introduction of grades, more frequent essay writing, and the option to skip a grade in math (about 70% of students go this way). Additionally, you learn how to write stronger thesis essays, citing text for evidence, and get introductions to biology and physics. Along the way, you read many classics, including Bless me Ultima, To Kill a Mockingbird, and even a Shakespeare play. On top of all that, you do several projects, including dressing up as an Egyptian, designing a biosphere, learning about racial inequality, and using advanced math to design and create a 'doll' and make calculations on it. In middle school, there are also many notable field trips, including Marin Headlands, Yosemite, and DC/NYC (optional, over spring break), which happen in the 6th, 7th, and 8th grades, respectively.

All of these projects, activities, and field trips have well prepared me for high school, making it seem relatively easy compared to 8th grade at NSA. I have gotten so many opportunities over the year, including working on the yearbook, flying a drone, and helping transform our news program, KNSA. Yes, I edited all the KNSA videos in the 2018-19 school year. The photo in the front cover of the 2019 yearbook was shot by me. I miss going to this school, but I still visit once in a while to say hi to all the teachers and students I have left to go to high school.</review>

<text>Premium fish every time. The times they didn’t have specialty fish I wanted they ordered it for me. Will make anything you can think of, custom sushi. Once you get to know the chefs you can just let them have go with chefs choice.< /text>< Name>

<rating>5<//rating><review>Great sushi place. We enjoyed everything we ordered. The fish is fresh, the restaurant is clean, and the service was quick. The prices are typical of sushi restaurants in the area. Parking is plentiful as it is located on the perimeter of a shopping mall, also making access quick in and out. They have a pretty extensive menu with all the sushi restaurant favorites, so if you're looking for a hearty, delicious sushi meal priced right, I recommend Love Boat Sushi.< /review>< Pictures>

Great sushi and the curry ramen is fantastic. Staff is super friendly and courteous. The spicy tuna roll was my favorite!< /Review>

<review>My first time in and I had the rainbow roll which was really fresh and looked great. It was a large portion and only $10.99 when most places charge $13 or more. Chef John was friendly and joked around. It was very clean inside with good service.<//review><Rating>5<//Rating><Resp>None</Resp>< Gmap_id>

Lots of variety. When they found out it was my birthday, they gave me a free green tea sundae. So nice! Lovely birthday outing.<//Text><gmapID>0x80db7e3c5d22cf37:0x10923bddf7c4e9ae< /gmapID>< name>

I have been here twice now.  Absolutely love their choices and the quality of the food. The baked mussels are the best I have ever had anywhere. The mussels are cut in smaller pieces, loaded with cheese and piled with crab meat. Had a soft shell crab dish that was the whole crab cut in 4 pieces. INCREDIBLE. My friend had the poke salad. This salad had sliced avocados on top, variety of fish. Except this salad wasn't laying on a bed of salad.. LOVED IT!!!
Will be back real soon!< /text>

A fantastic local sushi chain. I think they have two locations.  This one is perfect and the site is situated near the mall with options.  The service is fast and friendly and the fish has a fresh taste.< /review>

<text>Yesterday, June 1st, I went to pick up an order that I had placed. When I walked in the kind young man working up front could tell I was very upset and asked if I was okay. I ended up breaking down and crying because of a really rough day. He was so unbelievably kind that it brought me to more tears. Not only is their food amazing but their customer service and their genuine caring of human beings. I will definitely keep going back and appreciate them even more.</text>< resp>

<Text>Truly an amazing establishment. I've been coming here for years and have received nothing but great service, delicious food and a full belly. Very fresh ingredients and fish. Anytime I'm in the mood for sushi, this is the place I go. The lunch boxes and ordering by the roll is my favorite way to go.</Text>< Pictures>

Good food and the service was fantastic. A reasonable price per dish. No complaints here. I'll be back. Wait time for food was reasonable. The booths were comfortable. The server was constantly refilling our drinks. And the food tastes great. Not crowded at all.</Review>

Walked in and waited to be seated for a hot min.
All the workers just ignored us. After a bit I tried to catch the attention of a worker who was in front of me, I legit said “excuse me ma’am” three times and she ignored me. Ight. So we walked out and around the corner is another sushi place called “ youandi sushi” go here!!!!! This place is sooo beautiful inside, mellow, and the workers are very kind! Great place to take a date or be with family/friends!<//review>

<Review>I've been to this location three times. My first experience was not to a standard of which was pleasing. Our waitress was not personable at all, and every time we asked for things that should have been provided like napkins, straws (prior to the plastic straw ban) and drink refills, she gave us a disgusted look like we were bothering her. The different varieties of sushi we ordered were delicious nevertheless. At the suggestion of my husband, we decided to go a second time. Our second experience was a complete turn around, and we were pleasantly delighted with the service we received and there were no issues at all...all of our sushi choices were phenomenal. Our third visit was equally pleasing all around. The ambience of the place is quiet, and the space is not large, just right; the lights have been dimmed all the times I've visited (all visits were at night time). Overall, if you aren't looking for anything extra fancy, you should be pleased with their sushi options.</Review></record>

Been here a few times now and the main thing that brought us back is the delicious food! Probably the best sushi around the area. The service is also great and once you've come around a few times they will definitely remember you.< /review>

<text>This is the best sushi joint in town!! They have a wide selection of flavors. Each roll is flavorful and unique. These  chefs know what they are doing. This place is hands down better than Hana Sushi and Sushi Boat. Another plus is their customer service is amazing and every roll is also visually great! Even their cheapest rolls are incredible in taste and presentation. Absolute must place to visit!< /text><GmapID>0x80db7e3c5d22cf37:0x10923bddf7c4e9ae< /GmapID><username>R.

EXCELLENT service. They all including chefs greet everybody coming in. The moms walks around and check to see if everything is OK. They even give all you can drink soft drinks. They put flowers on each plate for that romantic Love Boat Sushi experience.<//review>

So far I would say Sushi Love Boat has authentic tasting sushi. The atmosphere is welcoming and complimentary thanks to the chef for preparing each roll not only making it presentable but delicious. We tried the special rolls up to $15 rolls.<//Review>

This is our go-to for Sushi! They are so friendly and the food is AMAZING! Best miso in town and make sure to try the spicy edamame...trust me! They have stamp cards for frequent diners and they will remember you when you come back time and time again. Personable and professional service. Excellent food.<//review>

<Text>The Kobe Bryant roll was fantastic!  The salmon sashimi was also really good, although the pieces were small they serve 8 pieces.  The kids really enjoyed the tiger roll and I had a dragon roll that was great.  Every visit is a great experience.  Try everything.<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None< /response>< GmapID>

I was disappointed in the taste of the food. But before I say anything about the food I have to say the customer service here is 5+. Server's where very attentive and nice.
Now the food.
Miso soup was bland. Needed salt?
Spicy edamame had an orange and again bland flavor to it.
The "KELI" roll had too much of an orange flavor. Not very good.
Tried a few other rolls and was just overall disappointed with the sushi.
Food is a 2 star but I'm adding a star for great customer service<//text>

Best place in town for sushi, great service the waitresses are so sweet and accommodating. The owner takes the time to visit your table to say hi.

< Review>
My husband and I have been going here since 2010 on our first date. It is always great food and service. Sadly, last two sundays ago, I went there again with my children my husband and my brother and customer service on that particular day was horrendous. The lady was so rude and treated us like children. This is the first time we get really bad customer service in 8 years of being a customer here. We are very disappointed. The waitress was short and yanked the menus from my husband's  hands. Rushed us to order because apparently  she cannot handle being busy with customers<//Review>

The kid meal has teriyaki chicken, two california rolls, rice, salad and a pot sticker all for around $8. I have picky eaters and they beg to come here. If you like spicy food go for the "heart attack" roll. It's a jalapeno sushi roll and it is amazing! The parking is close and thw atmosphere is super clean and friendly. Good price for sushi.</review>< Pics>

This is my favorite sushi place. They have the best sushi and its the freshest! My boyfriend and I go at least once a week. The chefs are so friendly and you feel like you know them instantly. I don't eat rolls usually but the ones I have had there are great. The garlic albacore Is my favorite! Also sometimes we will treat us to an appetizer of short ribs or filet mignon wrapped asparagus, they are awesome!< /Text>

Horrible service.  Three of us were looking forward to spending 4-5 hours there with big Bill.  Instead,  we left before we even ordered because of sour faces and unfriendly service.  Too many other good spots with good service.</Text>

I've been to other stores and called the customer service myself and got nowhere. Rick, Carlos and Robert took care of me. I owe them for reals. They stayed after hours to make sure I got everything taken care of!! I'm definitely goin to go to them for everything from now on👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻< /Review>

I came in to the Verizon store because my old iPhone was going downhill fast. I didn’t have to wait at all for some assistance. Jeff, the manager, was extremely knowledgeable about my options for an upgrade. He presented the different plans, bundles and promotions that they had going on at the time. My experience was seamless and quick. My data was easily transferred from my old phone with no problems. Highly recommend this Verizon branch. :)<//review>

Don’t deal with Kevin or any manager here. They don’t take responsibility in changes they made to get the sale. Who in their right mind makes someone’s bill skyrocket over 160 dollars.</Text>

Absolutely do not use this Verizon location.  We had an appointment to meet with a Rep on a Saturday.  We were switching over from AT&T to Verizon, he was not prepared although my wife had spoken with him 5 days prior to set up the appointment.  It then took 6 hours to set up only 3 of the 5 phones.  When my wife asked why it was taking so long as it was getting frustrating his response was “ believe me I’d rather be doing better things also.”  We picked up 3 of the 5 phones at 6:30pm (our appointment was at noon), we were told your 2 other phones will be here in 2 business days.  So we made arrangements to come back Wednesday, they did not come in until late Wednesday so we made arrangements to come back Thursday.  On Thursday, I go in earlier than our appointment and a different individual helps me, I told him a little bit about our experience not the whole story and that I was going to leave the phones and my wife would pick them up once all information had been transferred.  He said oh that’s not necessary I’ll get you out of here real quick, he changes all the SIM cards and says there you go you can do all the simple set up at home.  Okay I was fine with that, I look at the bill while driving home (stupid me for being in a hurry and not checking the bill at the store). This new guy charged me set up fees on both phones, for 1 we were already told there would be no set up fees and for 2 he DID NOT SET UP ANYTHING!!  Do I call the store on my way home and speak with the guy who tells me oh yeah I shouldn’t have put those on there but they automatically come up????  He then tells me that he’s off so he’ll talk to his manager the following day.  We of course have to follow up with him which he tells us his manager is out sick but he will try to get it pushed through.  Next day, says no we will only waive 1 fee, our response was but how are you charging us a fee for something you didn’t do???  That’s when we got no response and apparently there is no manager onsite.  This has been incredibly frustrating and the worst possible first impression for Verizon Wireless.  I would absolutely warn you not to use this location.

On a up tick, we spoke with Gary at this location and he was very helpful technical wise.  I left out the other two employee names on purpose because it’s not worth putting them out there when it seems like a majority of this location lacks any training on how to treat a customer.< /text>

<text>I had to replace my damaged phone. I went to the Verizon store on Champlain. I walked in and immediately was asked what I needed. I spent about 3 hours with Carlos Flores. I have never had such good service from anyone in any business! He was thorough, knowledgeable, professional and ensured I got the best deals. He was able to save me money every month. I would highly recommend Carlos to anyone that needed Verizon service! I totally enjoyed his company and his knowledge helping me navigate thru my new phone. Thank you Carlos!!

Visited this Verizon location recently to take care of a few things. My salesman, Jonathan K. was super helpful when I had questions about my bill, offered me a plan to better fit my needs, and even helped me set up my new phone. He was knowledgable, patient (I ask a lot of questions), and very kind. The level of customer service I received from Jonathan today really raised the bar for me. More salesmen should follow suit. Great job Verizon, I will be back in the future.< /Review>

<text>I never post reviews on here, but I felt inclined to share how seamless my experience at this store was. Carlos and Rick, the gentlemen who helped me dedicated a few hours to helping me resolve some issues I was having with my new phone. This store is a bit out of my way but worth the extra 15 min drive, you won't regret your visit to this particular Verizon store, it oozes with professionalism and to add to that I couldn't help but notice how well dressed and handsome everyone there was.</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

<Text>Gary and Jeff provided excellent service as we acquired a new phone and tablets.  They went out of their way to make sure we had everything we needed/wanted, at a price we could afford.  They went over information in an easily  understandable way, spending the time we needed to walk away feeling comfortable with our purchase, showing us ways to better spend our phone budget. Hats off to Gary and Jeff!!<//Text>< Pictures>

The customer service I received was through the roof. Thank you to the Verizon team for helping me get the best deal possible.

I also appreciate you all letting me leave to do errands while my rep Alex set up my phone and tablet!! Never would’ve thought they would do that for me. I will always come to this store from here on out.

Customer service is spot on. I was helped at immediately after walking in. Chris Fisher helped me get the phone that fits my needs. The test of the staff were helpful as well. All the men working that day were well dressed and groomed. As other customers walked for service. I watched how they we're catered to and help. Like I said spot on service.</Review>

<Time>1551158318447< /Time><user_name>Alexsis Contreras</user_name><text>I had the absolute BEST experience ever! I was a Sprint customer and was just done with their network and customer service, so I decided today be the day I switch. I went to this store expecting to pay at least $500 because I had always thought Verizon was expensive. For everything I got today, it wasn’t even close to that!

After talking with Alex who was my rep, he had told me there are a ton of promotions that they had going on and that they were also Verizon’s primary partner choice called Cellular Sales. It made me a little weary at first but after Alex told me more about Cellular Sales, I knew I was in good hands. He wasn’t pushy at all. He actually showed me every single possible option, and showed me ways I could save money for my bill!! I never met anyone who would recommend me saving money. Most people always want me to spend more. At the end of the day, I was able to get a new account with Verizon, get the iPhone I wanted with twice as much storage as my last one, an iPad Mini that I’ve been LONG wanting for, and another item called a Hum that has amazing benefits for all Verizon customers!! The biggest thing is that I feel like every item I was able to get today fit into my daily life, and that made the decision making super easy.

What really blew me away about Alex is that he explained all of the policies, and was very transparent about every little detail of my bill. To say I am completely satisfied with my experience is an understatement. I have already told all of my friends about my experience with Alex and they will be coming to see him very soon!

I recommend this location, and Alex, to anyone and everyone!<//text>< user>

I was helped by Bryce & just wanted to quickly purchase an Apple Watch. I trusted Bryce & completed the purchase all through using my phone & recieved my receipt through a text message.

He made everything super easy & accommodated all my needs. I’m glad that Verizon has this employee who dedicates the time to customers & treats them right.

I recommend if anyone wants great service to ask for Bryce he will be the most helpful & understanding.</text>

Jordan D was an AMAZING help. He was very patient and had an answer to every question I threw at him! The other rep that was there had great service as well from what I observed. I believe his name was Jomar. I would recommend this Verizon to anyone, they are very professional with a sense of humor which is hard to come by nowadays. I drive all the way from Madera specifically for this store because Jordan is always great to work with. Not to mention they dress sharp here for an added bonus! 5 stars!< /text>

This is the best store in Fresno.  Jeff Lozares is tops.  He is the most knowledgeable and helpful account manager we have ever met.  Without him, we would be totally lost.  His personality and patience is tops.  He makes you feel so welcome when you come into the store and is always available to help.  Please let him know how we value him and also the corporate office.  He is awesome in every way.
He makes you feel so good while he is helping you and when you leave the store your problem is resolved and you feel so good.  He is #1 in my book.

Above and Beyond Wonderful service! I needed a cell phone for my son, who is away at school in Southern California. I wasn’t sure how I’d get the phone to him. Nathan was great in giving information regarding my cell plan and a bundle of items I could benefit from. Jayson Dekker overheard our conversation and offered to transport the devices I’d purchased, 5 and a half hours away, to my son. He arranged a visit with a family member near there in order to make the delivery. Nathan gave the sale over to Jayson, who set everything up. Beautiful collaboration between coworkers and such excellent service!  I will be back to these fine salesmen for my next upgrade. Thank you Verizon for hiring these incredible people.< /text>

<Rate>5</Rate><review>Jomar knows Verizon systems backward and forward. It was such a relief after haggling on the phone with customer service AND on chat for 30 minutes plus the “manager” never called back! He also showed me new promos and I saved 33% because I qualified for a new contract. He also explained how HUM works and installed it in the car and installed the app .!!He did most of the typing, code entries, for me and explained what I was doing. It made my day  Did I mention he is fast and accurate?? All of this took 15 minutes!< /review></record>

Received exceptional professional service from Jomar and Carlos at this Verizon Retail location. They were both extremely efficient, knowledgeable, and courteous in assisting me with purchasing a new phone, Ipad, and transferring my service to Verizon! I would give them both 10 stars!!!<//text>

<review>I went into Verizon to pay my bill on Perrin in Fresno. The gentleman that helped me was Efrain Serrano. He was kind and full of knowledge. I had only thought seriously about buying a phone after speaking with him telling me about a special Verizon had. It was a good deal. Patrons need to check the store in their area to see what special they have. Thank you Efrain Serrano!!! I’m excited about my new iPhone 8.😀<//review>< Name>

Hailey was so amazing!! I came in ready to get the iPhone 7 plus and although they were out she made the ordering process so simple!! I had so many questions about my account and ways to make it cheaper and she went over their many data options and helped me pick one that fit in my budget! The store it self is so nice and clean. Everyone knows what they're doing and are ready to help you with whatever you need! I will definitely be back to see them when my phone comes in to get the many accessories for my new iPhone!!< /text>

Highly recommend this store. We've been in more than once, for various reasons, and the entire staff is always friendly, knowledgeable, and very helpful. Most recently Joseph helped me pick out a new phone. I went in dreading the process, but he made it as painless as possible and took the time to help me find the phone and plan that are right for me.<//Text>

The new store is amazing! Everything is well displayed with easy access. I came in looking for a new phone case for my iPhone and Marcus gladly showed me the cases available. He encouraged me to try them out so I could select the one that best fit me which I am thankful for. Also, I'm excited to have a store near home since it saves the long drive to River Park!</Review>

<rating>5<//rating><Review>I wanted to write this review thanking Alex for everything he has done for me. I went in to simply pay a bill last week and hated my phone that I had. He showed me a promotion they had going on that would buy mine out and get me a new one. I didn’t have much time, but I really liked that phone. I told him if he could get me that phone and finish everything within 15min then I would do it. Sure enough Alex made it quick, and told me to come back so I can learn to use the phone. I’m not very technological like my great grandkids, but after having Alex’s every with anything I needed has helped a lot. The day after my purchase, my daughter gave Alex some grief because I got a new phone but didn’t know how to use it just yet. Alex was very polite and let her know that he was going to make sure to teach me and will be available for anytime I have questions. You know what. He has held up his word. Last Thursday I gave him a call thanking him for everything he’s done for me and telling him I’m so happy he’s available to help me whenever I need. I used to never be able to use the internet, but look at me now... this is possible because of his customer service. He’s a stand up gentlemen, respectful, and extremely honest. I’m glad my family has decided to only work with him at this location and not the one on Blackstone anymore. Thank you so much Alex. I hope this helps you</Review></record></dataset><record>

We set-up everything via text and then showed up to process our phone upgrades. Not only do they have a great retail space with everything you need phone accessory wise, but more importantly are very knowledgeable about all things phone and communication. They spend quality time with you and make you feel that traditional customer service is not a lost art. Visit them before you go elsewhere and you won't be disappointed.< /Text><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None</resp>< gmap_id>

<review>Can not understand a sales person that contacts you to do a plan review, you set a time and show up, and they do not show up for the appointment or contact you to let you know they will not be there. Won't be using this location again. Waste of my time.<//review>< Time>

<review>Hands down for the best Verizon Retailer in town. And the award goes to Charles, he is the best! Got his help with our new iphone 7 and very detailed follow up even weeks after. He often texts us to see if we are happy with our new phone and service. Definitely will suggest this place and especially Charles to family and friends.<//review><gmapID>0x809442f2cc399ee9:0xb82dd9e5308b6077< /gmapID>< UserId.>

<Text>Chris Fisher and the entire team at Cellular Sales, the authorized Verizon Retailer at Champlain and Perrin, is amazing. We set-up everything via text and then showed up to process our phone upgrades. Not only do they have a great retail space with everything you need phone accessory wise, but more importantly are very knowledgeable about all things phone and communication. They spend quality time with you and make you feel that traditional customer service is not a lost art. Visit them before you go elsewhere and you won't be disappointed.</Text>< Response>

Showed up at 8:30 on a Saturday night.  There were customers in front of us being helped, so we sat down and waited our turn.  Jomar came over to greet us and got to us right after he finished his other customer.  Jomar was a down to earth dude, very knowledgeable, and efficient.  He never made us feel like we were keeping him late (which we were) and provided phenomenal customer service and Verizon is lucky to have him.  The other employee there at the time, Jordan was also knowledgeable and professional. The two of them together are good for business.  Nice to see people not so uptight and able to laugh and joke while at work.  Thanks, Jomar!< /text>

The sales person Cameron was awesome he answered all of my questions about the phones I was interested in. He helped set up our phones. I left the store with a new phone for my son and I we were both happy. I  recommend this Verizon store to my friends and they were also happy with the service and knowledge of the staff.< /review>

Edit: They also pressure you into making a google review right there when you buy a phone. I feel it's dishonest becouse putting people on the spot makes you rate them higher.

That being said they were helpful. We reacived deals on both devices we purchased today. Overall satisfied. Though when I asked about specs I was answered with a "that are good" ... I bought it. The audio is really low volume. Video is good at 2160 x 1080p. The camera is 8 mp which is about half of this year's standard at 12mp. Overall it's kinda basic. It has Moto's gesture assistance which let's you tilt your screen to do actions (turn on flashlight, camera, ect.) Which was cool. Over all it was JUST good.<//text>

Chris Cisneros was able to explain Hum to a non-techie, and make it sound easy.  That's major league!  He also helped me pick out equipment and a plan to best suit our family's needs.  People like Chris keep us coming back to Verizon.</text>

My visit with this store was absolutely UNEXCEPTABLE.  I am absolutely disappointed with Verizon and it's sales associates because they could not replicate the issue in the store they told me I need to pay for a new phone even though I have Asurion I do not pay for insurance every month to pay for a brand new phone I was also not made aware of the fact that insurance only pays for a refurbished phone when I paid for a $50 screen protector I was not notified that I need to register online for the warranty so when my screen cracked I could not get a new phone I am upset and absolutely irate with Verizon and how it handles its customers when my time is up for my phone I will not really up upon my contract I will make it my personal mission to make sure that people know Verizon does not take care of its customers like advertised once again I am having issues with Verizon for the third time.< /Text>

Me and my family came in to pre-order all of our iPhone 7's.  The initial expression was a state of the art store with immediate service.  No long wait times like the other locations.  Kim and Viri were great and helped us through the whole process with trading in our old devices.  They were very helpful and courteous and answered all of our needs.  We will definitely be coming back to this store!</Review>

< Review>
Well I went at 10:40 something in the morning and was met by a very well presented and professional employee named Camron. I was helped immediately with great customer service about going in to get an iPhone 7 plus. The gentleman named Camron answered all of my questions and concerns to the best of his ability and I gotta say he did an awesome job.
BUT Camron wasn't able to give me a million dollars but other than that he did above and beyond customer service. I'd recommend you go to him to get awesome service.< /Review>

I love that particular secret Verizon  store!!  The sales people have the time to listen to your needs for a phone and are well aware of their stock and very knowledgeable about the different phones.  I was unhappy with my iphone.  Jessica Houk helped me when the screen just went black  to get me a new iphone (refurbished).  Jennifer was there again when  the new one went black again.  She got it working again but she had really listened to me and checked to see if I had an upgrade coming, which I did and she showed me the Google Pixel XL, it is more fitting my needs, which she determined by taking the time to listen.  I love the Pixel, it is perfect.  When I have a few questions, I will look for Jessica in the secret neighborhood Verizon store because she will have the time to help me.  It is truly CUSTOMER SERVICE as I grew up with.  Thank You Jennifer Houk, Cheryl Blak</review>

<text>I was getting really tired of overpaying for subpar service and shotty reception with ATT after being with them for over 10 years. I finally decided to make the switch based on the testament from family and friends I would get a much better value for my money with Verizon. I came in to port my number and luckily there was no wait. The last time I had step foot in an ATT store a few days ago I was 12th in line with an estimated wait time of 2 HOURS!!!

Kim, the associate that I had the pleasure of working with was super friendly and personable, she truly made the switch effortless. Answered all my questions and I was in my new iPhone 7+ in no time! I was impressed by the above and beyond treatment I received here.

The Verizon network does not disappoint, my LTE is light years faster and more reliable than what I have been experiencing with my old service provider and have full bars! Really glad I made the switch and wish I had done it sooner.< /text><Pics>None</Pics>< userid>

Thieves! Ordered from them through doordash one hour before they closed and my order never arrived. They stole $37 from me and never gave me a refund! Do yourself a favor and don't get ripped off like me!<//Text>

<username>Ricardo Estrella</username><Date>1593330128539<//Date><rating>1< /rating><text>Went to buy 4  regular tacos for quick lunch, total amount 10 dollars. 10 dollars! Come to find out they add a 50 cent charge for carne asada  for each taco. Dont know about you but 10 dollars for 4 regular tacos is to expensive. Adding 50 cents for anything carne asada is a joke, Plus they are greedy with thier salsa cups. I spent 30 dollars on food and they gave only 2 cups for salsa, they also will try to give you only 5 to 8 chips with your meal. Being greedy will be their down fall. I wouldn't of noticed the extra charge because they said 7 dollars was the total but looked at the receipt and a 2 dollar charge   for 4 carne asada tacos. Total amount 10 dollars. ( Plus tax)<//text>< Pictures>

<Name>VicDaBrick< /Name><text>Time and time again they disappoint me. I think I let so much time pass by before buying from them that I forget how stingy they are with their food. I just bought fish, and shrimp tacos, and was majorly disappointed. My taco was a mixture of pico de gallo and the other half shrimp. The shrimp was so diced up that there were bigger pieces of tomato! The tacos looked big, and full but was all an illusion due to the excessive lettuce. Fish tacos were the same; I'll never buy from them again.</text>< Rate>

The tacos were just meat and tortilla - no cilantro or cabbage and no chile. Not even on the side. The refried beans were a dark lump that looked like they came out of a can. The chicken was dry, greasy and crunchy. Like they threw old meat on the grill with some grease to heat it up. I didn't even give it to the dog.< /Review>< pictures>

Fatty, flavorless meat. Ran out of chips, saw someone running in with tortillas from the store on out way out. Salsa had no spice and barely any flavor. Quality has gone down over the past few years. They charge way more than they should.< /review>

Well making a quick stop to Don Taqueria Taco, my family experienced poor customer service by the women who takes the orders. After arriving she came to take orders while she was sitting at a table. She seemed upset that she had to get up to take our orders. The service was very slow and the food was not worth the price. Definitely find somewhere else to go.</text>

< Review>
I would always stop for menudo, tacos or soups. Today was the worst service I ever had. I went with a friend and his order came out quickly I had to go up and tell the woman about my order and was told it would not be long, my order came and I had to ask what happened to my tortillas they came and my friend had to wait for me to finish. Very bad service I told them I would never come back again and they just turned around and left our table. No concern what's so ever I know it's now under new ownership and maybe you don't care. But if you want to do good you need to take care of your customers. Another woman stopped by and was leaving because she found a hair in her burrito we told her to say something but just left. Good luck< /Review>

All bad! After getting my menudo here for the last 10 years, today that's gonna change! I believe after switching ownership they got rid of the old cook....and he took his recipes with him. The menudo I tasted today was the worst I've tasted in Tulare County. Horrible flavor and super greasy!!! I think I may have cried a little because this was my GoTo when it came to menudo. I kind of wanna start a GoFundMe so we can pay for the old cook to come back to this place or maybe even start his own restaurant. Very sad day in Visalia. Can the new owner please bring back the old cook. You're losing business bud. The service has even gotten so poor. Well good luck.< /text>

Quick service. Since I'm on a low-carb diet they were able to accommodate me by making their Super Burrito with no tortilla, no rice, light whole beans and add lettuce.< /review>

I came to visit family in Visalia and this became the go to place to eat. I had a michilada and the huevos rancheros. Everything tasted fresh and delicious. The staff was friendly and the food came out quickly. I will definitely be coming back whenever I visit visalia again< /Text>

<Review>First off when walking in, your greeted with such rudeness. As if it cost the cashier lady to smile. Makes you not want to even give them business. Second, after being treated with such rudeness to find hair in your food.

Spoke to family members/friends about my experience at Don Taco (Sep 2015). Comes to my surprise hair in food is common. Your more likely to have hair in your food, when eating there.

Save your money.!!!!!<//Review><Name>Vee Prado</Name>< Gmap_id>

The tacos de papa with choriso, verdura, or machaca sometimes seems like you are eating mucht potatoes and other time the potatoes are uncook. The Beans for me are delicious.</text>< Pics>

<Text>Nothing to say but good stuff. If you are hungry for tacos de guisado this is the go to place for extremely awesome food, I go there once every 2 weeks, never disappoints. Some Tacos are Chicharron con chile, bistek ranchero, huevo con chorizo, papa con chorizo or papa con verdura, and sometimes puerco con nopales. This place makes Christine'c and Chabelas taste bad. Highly recommend to all of those passing by, prices are very fair. Just careful for the salsa or chiles serranos they give you, they  makes your nose run and your eyes water, that is an authentic Mexican salsa right there.<//Text><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

< review>
Before I made my moved from Atlanta to Palm Desert, I was easily able to arrange rental of a storage unit from Life Storage by phone.  It was a very smooth process which helped make my move less complicated.  As soon as I arrived in Palm Desert, I made contact with Andrew at the facility, who was extremely caring, professional yet personable, and who catered to all my needs (and there were many!) with excellence, diplomacy, and incredible calm.  Andrew is a huge asset to Store 606 and I will continue to sing his praises with every chance possible.  In addition, the facility is clean, well taken care of, and easily accessible.</review>

Life Storage Palm Desert is the BEST!
Matt, and Ariana, are terrific.  They are friendly,  professional,  competent and problem solvers.   Matt listens to your storage needs and issues and trouble shoots until the optimal storage space is found, and recommends the best solution for you.  The facility is clean,  convenient and accessible.   Highly recommend Life Storage Palm Desert off Country Club and Washington.< /text>

<Text>First of all, the place itself is great: Clean, perfect location, no elevators, good prices, no haggling...But the secret is the people working there! We spoke to Beau and met with Matt, who made the entire registration etc. totally painless , explained everything very clearly, all the while keeping up an intelligent conversation. I am afraid we will never take our stuff out of that place now, just because!<//Text>< pics>

After calling around to many storage companies in the Palm Desert area, it was clear that Life Storage was our choice!  Beau, at the front desk took my call and helped us secure our storage unit.  He's knowledgeable, was very patient with all our questions, and has a good sense of humor.  Both Beau and Matt continue to provide terrific customer service whenever we call in, including the day On Time Storage (also awesome!) delivered our home goods.  Beau took us on his golf cart to show us the unit, making sure the size would fit our belongings.  What we LOVE about this storage company is that there are NO elevators, which can greatly increase the moving time and expense when bringing items in and out of the storage unit.  All second level units are simply accessed by driving up to that level.  Besides great pricing, the hours that people have access to their units is much longer than most other companies.  Thank you again to both Beau and Matt!</review>

<text>We've been renting 2 10×20 storage lockers for approximately 7 months and haven't had any issues with the exception of them wanting to raise the price by $30. This is some SERIOUS BS. It's almost as if they force you to get out of their place and find a more reasonable place. There's 2 clerks that manage the place at differant times of course. Both are extremely nice and helpful.< /text>< pictures>

Life storage is a top notch facility. Beau and Matt who care for the facility make sure to keep on top of everything from updates to auctions. Plus, this place has security up the wahzoo.

If you’re looking for a great and secure location to store your possessions, life storage would be the place to go.

Thanks guys! Keep up the awesome work.< /text>

<Text>Calling or Visiting Life Storage in Palm Desert was a very good experience for me.  During my research, I reached out to a few Storage facilities to determine their services in respect to my needs.  After speaking to Beau, I was more prepared to receive my goods from a Moving Company.   Beau took the time to explain the Life Storage Services.  My move in date went smoothly, because Beau had requested me to pre-register and it saved me time.<//Text>< Pics>

We gave them 1 stars because we were charged for, and  paid for, the unit through 12/31/2019. We moved our belongings out on 12/16/2019. A friend was suppose to go over and check on the unit for us and they had already rented it out! Double dipping. We paid for it and wanted back in and it was gone!!

Wrong in so many ways. May seek legal action to stop this practice.<//review>

The service we get from Beau and Matt has been outstanding. The service is well beyond the norm. On a scale of 1-10, ten being the highest they are a 12! They are very professional, people oriented with a great sense of humor.  When we rented  our  storage unit  it was clean, and based on their recommendation to accommodate our needs, it was just right. Their service orientation does proud to the company's reputation.

Beau and Matt provided top-flight customer service.  Both are friendly, professional, and super-helpful.  Beau was extremely thorough in his explanation of how the facility works.  From the street, the facility is very nicely landscaped and secure, with gates.  And the ladies' bathroom inside the office was extremely clean.  Beau drove me via golf cart to my unit, shared about the facility's history, and made me think of a time when employees worked for the same company for 30 years.  That kind of loyalty and investment is hard to find.  When I returned the next day, Matt was super-helpful and kind.  Drove all the way from Palm Springs tor rent here.  And it's worth it!< /review>

<text>My wife and I were literally on the way to the airport but needed information regarding rental of a climate controlled storage unit for planning purposes.  Beau Clume was the man of the hour.  He knew his product, was professional, and very competently completed the paperwork as the minutes clicked down to our check in time at the airport.  Outstanding service.  We highly recommend Life Storage and the friendly staff who work there.

Staff members, Beau and Matty, at Life Storage is very friendly and helpful with all of my needs since my arrival to setup the storage unit and processing documentations. They saw a mistake in my reservation and quickly worked towards getting it resolved in a timely manner, reassuring that they will sort everything out for me. I also wanted to recognize that Beau pays sincere attention to his customer and really does provide excellent customer satisfaction: offering water when he notices you have been out in the heat, offering a flat dolly for the many boxes, as well as getting to know you.

DO NOT USE THIS LOCATION!!  Even though we had a secured lock from them, supposedly has security cameras and we paid for insurance we were ROBBED!!!  Tell me how it's possible that they do not know how it happened??? Thankfully we had removed most of our items but we still had a lot of tools and many golf clubs etc which were stolen.</Text>

This storage facility is really great.  Conveniently located, temperature controlled units, 2nd floor units have drive up access (up ramps) so no elevator hassles.  Great web account access to pay your bill, manage your account.  Beau Crume was also very helpful in the setup process.  Best facility I have ever used!<//review>

I am stunned that a company would treat customers that experienced a unit break-in at their facility - caused by their poor security practices -  this poorly, but here we are.

While on vacation, we received a "Notice of Unsecured Property" as well as an "Account is Past Due" notice. When we left for vacation, the unit was closed and locked and our account was current and up to date, so we called the facility to find out what happened.

When we called the facility we spoke with Beaux and were told our storage unit had been broken into. We informed him that we were on vacation and couldn't do anything but would handle it as soon as we were back in town. After that conversation it was assumed that everything was good, but when we came home and went to look in on the storage unit we found out two very surprising things.

1) When we got to the office we were told that the facility staff member had let the burglar in because he said "I forgot my code". The facility let the thief in without checking his ID or anything - just buzzed him right in.

2) There was another unit break-in, while we were there, that was done BY THE SAME THIEF.

Beaux was clearly pissed that he had to deal with it and took it out on us. (This was made clear by how he handled our interaction that day) He said the break-in was our fault because of our lock - and then tried to sell us on the lock that they sell. After going to look at our unit door, the only part that was broken was the latch that allows someone to use a personal lock. It was basically ripped off, meaning it wasn't the padlock that allowed the robber in, so the type of lock would have made zero difference.

Beaux then said he would give us the lock 50% off but he would "catch hell" for doing that, giving us grief the whole time. We again said we didn't want the lock. Beaux then told us that he wouldn't fix the door or give us another unit. We were basically now forced to buy his lock. So we purchased the lock and secured our unit so we could get out.

It's ridiculous that someone who let in the individual who broke in to our unit would then harass, take advantage and force us to buy one of his products. There was zero remorse or empathy from this man. Maybe he was having a bad day, but he should never have taken that out on us. We were in a vulnerable position and Beaux did absolutely nothing to help. Shame on you and shame on your company. Life Storage, you really need to re-evaluate who you allow to run your facilities. We'll be taking our business to Security Public Storage on the other side of the freeway.</text>

<review>Staff here at this Monterey location friendly and competent but always seems under staffed. Go directly here first when you land before getting your bag or you will wait a while in line. They seem to always park your rental car in the farthest spot ...it would be nice if they rotated their cars that are to be picked up accordingly. Always got a nice clean car at this location<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

Avis on 1333 Highland in Los Angeles has great service. They are kind, attentive and efficient. The car was great. I was able to drop it off at the Monterey Airport. When I parked the car, instructions were clearly displayed. Then followed the instructions at the Avis counter. Done!  A seemless trip.</Review>

< Review>
I prepaid for a one-way car, $1,064, and when I turned it back in I got an additional $217 charge. Apparently it was for 1/4 tank of gas (the tank was FULL, on the F because I just filled it), and a charge for being late. It was due at 10:11 and I was there at 10:45. With a 30-minute grace period from 10:11 (when I picked it up) that's 4 minutes late!!!! I called Avis billing and the person I spoke with was absolutely not helpful, in fact they were insistent that the charge was valid and would not entertain removing it. I will never rent from Avis again, after 20 years being a preferred customer in addition to having all 100 of my employees rent from you for years as well. Bad customer service!!! I am not happy. I have dispute the charge with Visa as well. I feel totally disrespected by Avis. Ugh.< /Review>

I made a reservation onl7ne with debit card.  When I arrived ready to dr9ve 500 miles to get home I was informed my debit card wasnt satisfacto6 for renting.  They offered no suggestions of places to maybe help me as I needed to get home.  I did finally find that AVIS would accept my debit card without issue.  I wint try Enterprise again.<//text>

< Review>
Without a doubt the worst experience, EVER! The woman behind the counter interjected herself in the conversation I was having with my friend, accused me of saying something that I had not said, and went on to objectify me as yet another Obama liberal. Who I am and my political preferences are none of Avis/Budget's business. I strongly suggest considering another rental company, or atleast another location.< /Review>

<Rating>5</Rating><Text>Booked a car for one-way rental.  Got a Ford that got great mileage, even at max. highway speed.  Decent rate, comfortable, and filled our needs.  Agent in Monterey very nice.  Only glitch was we went to pick it up Saturday night, but arrived about 8:15pm, and the counter closed at 8, so had to return in the morning.  Our fault for not noticing the earlier closing on Saturday nights.< /Text>< Pics>

Long wait times on the phone just to return a vehicle. My flight is early in the morning and these cats don't open until 7am, how inconvenient,  since I need to be checked in way before this time. They charged me a whole extra day for picking up 1 hour earlier, who does that? Clearly a company that doesn't mind stepping on your toes for you being early . And what happens when you arrive one hour late? They'll rent your car out to someone else, so...there you go!</review>

<Text>My experience was good overall.  It was easy to check-in and complete the paperwork, the car was very nice and clean, and the (online) rate was exceptional.  However, there were a couple of items that bothered me.

First, it was a little confusing to find out where to leave the car when returning.

Next, there is a sign at the counter saying if you drive less than 75 miles to not fill up the car and they'll take care of it ... for $13.99.  I didn't want this option, so I filled up the car myself (for $8), but the $13.99 was still charged to my card and I had indicated on the folder upon return that I had filled the car.  My mistake, and it was only $14, but...

Lastly, keep in mind that if you get a special online rate (mine was $34 for 2 days) and you have an interest in keeping it another day, make sure you ask what the cost is BEFORE you close out your contract.  Once they close it out, they cannot (or so my agent said) reopen it.  Thus, had I wanted to keep it another day, if I asked before I closed it out, the cost would have been $17.  After it became over $100.</Text>< Pictures>

good luck trying to reach the desk at the airport, they don't answer and you get the national Avis which CANNOT help you with certain questions.</Text>

<Review>Monterey Jet Center. I had gone online before leaving and reserved a car at Monterey Jet Center at the Monterey airport. When we arrived at the airport the car was waiting and the flight crew brought it to the plane. Great service by the ground folks. Unfortunately the rate for the full size car was over $90 for the few hours we needed the car. I use Avis for work all the time but next time I will price shop before choosing Avis.</Review>< Pictures>

I can't come up with one negative thing about renting our family's vacation rental car from Avis.  The gentleman at the counter was wonderful.  Booking online was easy.  Dropping the SUV back off was also a breeze.  GO AVIS!</Review>

Initially friendly service, but when it came to charging for the car, they charged the wrong credit card without even showing us the bill. Then they said there was nothing they could do since we got bad information from the clerk that initially processed our rental.</Text>

The man at the monterey Ca airport  Avis working at 7am on Wednesday the 28th airport has poor customer service skills, lack of decorum and issues speaking respectfully to women. Go with another company if you can. He tried to demean my mother with harsh language. We will be using a different company in the future.< /Review>

Have a hard time giving only 4 stars, just because the charburger was so good and the price was great. The drive through line was long (again due to good food at a good price) and slow. Give yourself time if its busy...or better yet use curbside pickup!😀<//Review>

Update: they refunded my order and were nice about it so I feel less bad now, will give them another chance in the future.

Burger was burnt and smells weird. I feel kind of sick after eating only half of it and had to throw the rest away. The lid wasn’t on the shake right and it popped off when I picked it up (from the middle gently, not even the top) while walking up to my house so the whole thing fell. Disappointed because I usually like the habit but I feel sick from eating the food today... $20 for a burnt burger and a shake with an unsecure lid. I usually would go here often but I won't be back. This isn't the first time I've been disappointed (cold or burnt fries in the past, fries today were alright). Too expensive and a waste of time and money today, I worked a 7 hour shift and treat myself to this and it sucked. Too bad.</Review>

There were 5 adults and 3 children in my group. Without exception,  we all enjoyed our food.  The grilled ahi tuna on ciabatta bread was our favorite sandwich. The sweet potato fries and onion rings were delicious.  Employees were kind, attentive,  and safety-conscious. Tables were sanitized after each use. We'll be back!</review>

< Review>
Food is always good. I feel like people sometimes are so impatient now a days. Like when I first step into the habit, I obviously know I’m going to wait around 7 minutes especially because the food is cooked to order. I hate when I see people acting so rude towards the employees, it’s like they expect to be treated like some royal gods, like cut them some slack. The food is good and worth the wait, ain’t their problem your in a rush and don’t have time to wait. As long as my food is hot and fresh and served to me with a smile like it always is I don’t mind waiting. Btw that French onion char is actually pretty good. It’s one of my favorites and if not the Santa Bárbara with some onion rings or spicy green beans are always a good pair and worth the try. Thanks habit for another great meal<//Review>

<text>Always good food, fast service and friendly staff. What I like the best is that you can tell the manager Martha knows how to run the business. She stands out from the rest of the staff and I’ve come here several times and I notice she always waved and welcomes me from the kitchen and others regardless of where they are, I always feel welcomed even with my complicated order.

These location can get pretty busy, and thats because of their amazing food and service is hard to match. Thank you The Habit, you all do a great job, keep it up!< /Review>

NOT A FAN OF RAW MEAT   had a double tempura jalapeno char   but one Patty was uncooked so I had to give it to my dogs.   I guess next time I'll say well done.  So there's no misunderstanding.

Burger / sandwiches not so much. Pretty messy greasy, and leaves you feeling unhealthy after you eat. Fries also taste just a bit off.</review>< Pictures>

<text>Ordered golden fried chicken sandwich, was paper thin, like 1/4” thick, with rubbery breading.  NOT acceptable at all for a $9 chicken sandwich. You know where It is acceptable? Burger King, for a 99¢ chicken sandwich. Looked nothing like the picture of a thick, juicy CRISPY patty. (Update) Thought the basic cheese burger was safe, was wrong.  This location terrible. Done going to this place.</text><pics>None< /pics><Resp>{'time': 1588267850362, 'text': 'Hi Colleen, we are so sorry to hear about your recent experience at one of our restaurants.

After leaving drive thru I realized  my sweet potato fries didn't get rang up so went inside. They also forgot to give me the kids drinks too!! Glad I went back in to get my fries. Staff are really nice and food is delicious 👌<//review>

The burgers here are absolutely amazing. Even the veggie burger is delicious and I'm not a vegetarian. It's nice being able to order tempura green beans instead of french fries. It's usually busy but that's just because it is so good< /text>

They forgot the dressing for my wife’s salad. Drove all the way home then all the way back to sit in another hour line because they wouldn’t open the door to bring out the dressing for the salad. Also tried calling but the operator is not located in the actual store. So what is the point of having a phone if you cannot speak with anyone inside the store anyways!?</text>

<text>Whoever was the girl working the front counter on June 5th ~3:15PM needs to be retrained in customer service. She wasn't rude per se but was unpleasant and gave me a hard time over a penny on an $11.26 order. I'm not kidding about the 1¢. In the past I've frequently asked for a side of garlic aioli with my order and have never been charged. She wanted 50¢. I come this location maybe every other week. I live quite locally. I enjoy their burgers. But if I see her at the counter the next time, I'm turning around and dining somewhere else.</text>< Pictures>

Fast friendly service. Good variety of meals and drinks. You can eat somewhat healthy. Go early as it can get crowded.  A very good alternative if you are looking for a Burger, salad, or chicken sandwich. Don't pass by this place.  Parking can be an issue, but they do have a drive through.<//Text>

Shakes were good. Usually I judge cleanliness by the bathrooms but in this case I didn't bother since the kitchen was in full view. The kitchen floor was a mess. Fries all over, surprised someone didn't fall. Last but not least, prices were high compared to other establishments for what we ordered and received. Quality and quantity just was not there! 😔</Text>< Pictures>

I wanted to give this place a try for a while so today I pulled the plug and went there and got the double cheese Habit burger. It did not disappoint AND the price was reasonable. Also unless you are really hungry get the double, otherwise the single is perfect sized.< /Review>

<text>Always a great pick! The Habit is one of my all-time favorite burger joints. From the Santa Barbara Char-burger to the Tempura Green Beans, this place has a good variety of indulgences, and healthier options. If you've never been, I strongly suggest you try them out.<//text><pics>None< /pics><resp>None< /resp>< GmapID>

If it wasnt wrong I would eat here every single day! I've never had a more consistent burger! Everytime I come here the food is always great, always made fresh. The staff at this location is always very friendly.< /review>

<Review>Tonight (the day before mother's day) I felt like having a really good hamburger. My husband suggested the habit. They are very reasonably priced and they even have sweet potato fries!! Off we went. When we were ordering the gal behind the counter heard someone in my party discussing how it's too bad the hamburger he wanted doesn't come on sourdough. After she was done with my order she said she could change any hamburger to sourdough. My son and husband were happy campers and I was one happy momma. And you know the saying, "if momma ain't happy; ain't nobody happy". Momma was happy! The food came within 5 minutes hot, fresh, and perfectly done. The sweet potato fries were delish and the onion rings and garlic fries added to a very pleasant dinner. I think the Habit is going to become MY HABIT! Lol...<//Review>< Pictures>

<Review>I'm so glad they sell vegetarian patties...I just so happened to be in the mood for a veggie burger because it was a little late for me to be eating and boom! They had some. Chill spot, cool crowd, awesome fries. My friends loved the food, my wife loved her burger. Say no more.</Review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

They always get my to go orders wrong, or an item is missing.. also saw one of the cooks use a tissue to wipe her sweat, didn’t wash her hands and proceeded to make a burger. The Menifee location is the best.<//Text>

<text>The Habit is really good no matter which one i have eaten at. The customer service was really good at this location. The cashier was cleaning tables and making sure the customers were doing good. She was very helpful. Food was very tasty and came out in really good time. Everything was cooked perfectly and correctly. This location has a drive thru which is really convenient and time saving as well. Parking will be tough though once the center is fully built and occupied.<//text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

New restaurant in town. Clean and new age interior has good vibes. I'm a burger/sandwich guy and boy is this a good value. Very fair and competitive pricing. I will be eating here on the reg. **update** after 5 visits, the new store is still holding up. They get a lot of business and it might be hard to get a spot to eat during high volume times.< /review>

Great food and fast friendly service. Even during lunch rush they are faster than the other "burger " joints and way better food. Tip: Try the green bean fries.</review>

I posted 3 ✨because granted I love their food, but this particular location is dirty!! I was in the drive thru, and noticed the prep female wasn’t wearing any gloves... no biggie, until I saw her picking up the shredded lettuce to transfer to another container!!! Gross!! Then, I saw her grab the lettuce and place it on a burger... with no gloves. The drive through attendant had a cut on her thumb.. and when my receipt was handed to me, there was blood on it! No thank you, I will avoid this location! Not sanitary at all!!!<//Review>

<review>Always amazing food here. My husband got his order wrong, but was too hungry to realize it until he had almost finished. He went to talk to someone about it to at least get refunded the difference and the customer service was great.</review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

I was in the drive thru, and noticed the prep female wasn’t wearing any gloves... no biggie, until I saw her picking up the shredded lettuce to transfer to another container!!! Gross!! Then, I saw her grab the lettuce and place it on a burger... with no gloves. The drive through attendant had a cut on her thumb.. and when my receipt was handed to me, there was blood on it! No thank you, I will avoid this location! Not sanitary at all!!!< /text><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None</Response>< gmap_id>

For Fast food their burgers are great I personally like their grilled chicken sandwich on wheat with grilled onions and teriyaki the best, never had a dry one. Now the Golden Chicken sandwich is hit or miss and can be dry. The sides are good, the onion rings and tempura green beans are my go to's. And the Santa Fe Cobb salad is great. Also keep in mind that if you are in a hurry for say lunch it can take longer than your normal fast food place to get your food.</text>

I have gone to this place a few times and hey it fast food not much to say. But, this time I went and I had a piece of chewed gum fried in with my fries. I was told it was a frozen potato but potatoes to leave teeth imprints. was absolutely disgusted and won't be returning. also it smells like poop in there as well.</review>

Didn’t get what I ordered through the drive thru they got my order all wrong went inside, mind you I’m on my 30 min lunch , after waiting in drive thru for 15 mins the women who “helped” she said I had to wait 7 mins for my food at the point I couldn’t wait any longer so I asked for a refund still no apology or nothing and was also extremely rude</text>

<text>Poor quality meat.  After trying the Santa Barbara char burger, in comparison to quality of meat, Inn & Out is by far better. I would choose Carl’s Jr. meat over habit.
I’m sure habit’s fries are better.<//text><rate>2<//rate></record>

GREAT FOOD & SERVICE! My wife and I were heading back home to Solana beach after visiting her Mom nearby. We Googled food and thankfully a Habit Burger Grill came up about a mile away.The place was very busy when we walked in the front door around 1.30pm but very quickly it was our turn. I even had a quick chat with one of the managers named Brittany while waiting in line. Another manager named Dave served us very efficiently at the cashier desk when we ordered a Teriyaki Charburger and a Tri-Tip Steak Sandwich on sourdough with Teriyaki Sauce.We found a booth table at the rear of the eatery and very soon our food pager went off.Our lunch tasted very fresh, full of quality ingredients, very well presented & most of all...delicious! It was very relaxing to sit in a pristine store and enjoy a very nice lunch before recommencing our long drive home.</Review>

In keeping with supporting my local businesses, I went thru the drive thru and tried a portabello burger combination with the mango ginger tea and a cesar salad with tri-tip.  The price was great and the food even better, definitely will go back.< /text>
