Although Garcías garage was busy, Eddie was able to squeeze in an alignment for my truck. I was told it was going to be done towards the end of the day. I was ok with that knowing he was willing to help me out by doing it even though he was busy. I got to the shop close to closing hours and once the truck work was complete, to my surprise he even took the time to point out a radius arm that needs replacement. You would think that after closing time they would want to rush things to go home, but not with these guys. Eddie and his technicians took the time to work on my truck and explain what I needed. Overall took care of me as a customer. Thank you Garcías garage!< /text>

<Review>Today was my first time going there and I will definitely be returning for any car repairs in the future. Eddie was absolutely amazing and very helpful. He took care of my needs very quickly and made sure to explain everything fully. I was very impressed on the short amount of time it took to service my car and would recommend this place to anyone after my experience today.<//Review><pics>None< /pics>< Time>

Quick and painless. I went in and was happy to find a mechanic that wasn't covered in oil. He had one customer/vehicle before me so I waited about 20-30 mins.<//text>

As I was waiting in line to get written up for a smog check, the gentleman took a phone call, somebody on the other line was asking for engine Diagnostics, Eddie gracefully told them I don't do that work here. And unselfishly referred him to two shops in town, and a assured that caller there honest people.
My first time here. I'm impressed. I found my new auto shop in Perris. Go see Eddie. Mom and Pop Shop when you get quality Care and you are not a dollar sign. Thanks Eddie. Find out what customer service is all about.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

Having never floated before I wasn't sure what to expect, but the staff was very helpful, answered all my questions and gave me a brief introduction of how things work. I started with the introductory 3 float package and have gone on to become a member. The facility is always clean, relaxing,and welcoming. If you have never floated before, I recommend it!< /Review>

An oasis in the middle of Oakland! A very interesting way to enjoy some peaceful quiet time, to relax and it feels very therapeutic for the mind and body. Facilities were clean and staff friendly and helpful. I really enjoyed the sample of CBD honey before going in and appreciated they had a hair dryer I could use after! Float on friends~< /Text>

I love Oakland floats. I had a subscription for a while so have a regular attendance now - prefer the tanks but their custom built chamber is cool, too. Staff I always super relaxed and I suggest reading the book on floating in the lobby. Also pay close attention to seal the ear plugs before getting wet at all - and if the water never touches your face it’s easier</text>

<review>I wasn't sure what to expect, but the staff always make me feel comfortable and answer my questions. It's clean and well maintained and a very relaxing and enjoyable space to visit.
I recommend the float chambers instead of the tanks because you have a private shower in the room. However, I've sometimes gotten cold in the float chambers and I'm told the tanks tend to stay warmer since they are a smaller enclosed area.<//review><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< Gmap_id>

<Review>I had my first float at Oakland Floats the day after I ran my first marathon, and it was an excellent way to help both my body and my mind recover. Oakland Floats is quiet and peaceful, and Hannah answered every question about floating I didn't know I had, telling me tips and tricks to ensure I had a good time--put Vaseline on any small cuts on your fingers; be careful not to get the salt water in your eyes; if you do get salt in your eyes, use this solution; even different float techniques that people use!  I really appreciated her taking the time to give me a thorough understanding of floating. I really feel like it allowed me to have a full experience!

I had a really restful time, and really enjoyed the amenities. The earplugs in particular are very impressive and high quality. I got to just think about my running experience and do some creative brainstorming for a while. It was very peaceful and relaxing. I can see how people could fall asleep in here!

My ankles felt so much better coming out than going in, and my skin feels super smooth today! Thanks Oakland Floats! :)</Review>< username>

<review>Very calming space and amazing experience. The staff create a tranquil vibe, the rooms are clean, the ear bud things were the most effective sound blocking device I've ever used and the infused water after the float tasted amazing. 10/10 stars, an Oakland gem.< /review>< time>

Living in Oakland you need to free your mind sometimes. And this is the place to do it. Awesome experience, I recommend you give it a try. Fun times but relaxing as well<//Text>

Go Warriors!  Apparently the whole Warriors team floats so I thought I might check it out.  I am super glad I did and I would encourage all to check out Oakland Floats.  They are clean, organized, and provide and excellent experience for a beginner like myself.  I will be going on a weekly basis for the next 6 weeks (bought a package) as they say it gets better every time!  Can't wait!</Text>

< Review>
My first floating experience was lovely. I wasn't sure what to expect and I was a little scared of the concept of a float tank but really curious so I went for it and im so happy I did.

The staff was really friendly and the atmosphere feels very private and calm. Upon arrival they offer you tea and water and once its ready, they show you to your room. They ask you to take a shower before your float and then you can descend into the shallow depth of the float tank. From there on you just have to let the water do the work for you. It is so relaxing and healing. You just melt and let everything go. It is the best place to meditate and just plain relax. The water temperature is perfect and there are no distractions.

You will get the best nights sleep after a float here. I plan on making this a regular part of my self care regimen.

Highly recommend.<//Review>

I had an exceptionally positive and relaxing experience at Oakland Floats. Having never floated before, I appreciated receiving clear and detailed email communication and verbal instruction from the Oakland Floats staff prior to my session. The facilities were clean, comfortable, and private. The float itself was magical! I reached a state of deep, full-body relaxation, and I felt physically and emotionally lifted for days.</Text>

Oakland floats is in my opinion the best floating experience that the Bay Area has to offer. The atmosphere is calming and inviting, just the type of space you’d like to be in before taking the voyage inside yourself. Wonderful employees ready to help accommodate you in any way on a moments notice. The rooms and tanks themselves are clean, neat, and orderly. The experience is one you need to have yourself, if you were interested I would recommend it 100 percent. The longer the better, empty stomach, and ready your calm mind. I have successfully learned to start to let go of my constant muscle tension and relax into the moment. Also they have great swag and supplements in the front!!</review>

<text>HELLO BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE!! Try floating if you've never done it before and TRY IT HERE!! I am SO PLEASED with my experience. The place was very clean. The service was efficient, very kind and respectful, and they do a very good job at creating a calming atmosphere. They also were very good at easing any concerns I had and were patient with all my questions. And the float experience was INCREDIBLE!! Definitely plan on doing this again. Thank you OAKLAND FLOATS!!< /text>< Time>

This was a great way to try floating without the fear of claustrophobia. It's not a pod that completely seals up but a giant bathtub with a sliding door like a shower. Would definitely recommend.< /Text>

I recently visited this hip, relaxing experience and highly recommend it to others. I received it as a gift and didn't know much until I researched the benefits. It's definitely worth checking out! Do you like relaxing, calming experiences? Then this is for you! It really helped me clear my head and cleanse. Also, it's right down the street from my favorite bagel shop, so I can see much more of this combo in my future.</Text>

<text>I had a wonderful experience at Oakland Floats.  It is hard to describe other than afterward, I felt the most relaxed I have in years.  I slept like a baby every night the entire week - it was unreal.  Try this place.  The facilities are clean, the rooms are pretty quiet, and the atmosphere lends to the experience.  I will certainly be going back.</text>< GmapID>

INCREDIBLE! I floated for the first time last week and I can't stop talking about it. After dealing with some life stresses, taking the time to fully relax and decompress what exactly what I needed. I left feeling like I was floating on a cloud. I look forward to my next float! :)</text>

<Text>Hidden gem. If you care about self-care, Oakland Floats has you covered. I’ve done a float session, light therapy session and Normatec boot recovery session here. It’s a one stop shop for all my recovery and rejuvenation needs. A+ staff and experience!< /Text>< pictures>

<review>I absolutely love my time here. The facility is clean and the staff is friendly. I am a Massage Therapist and have also recommended many of my clients to Oakland Floats for stress management. It's so important for us to take the time to get out of our heads and just relax without any distractions, and in the technology world we're living in, that can be hard to do. Oakland Floats is a great place to escape and let yourself have the peace and quiet that we all need to keep ourselves on a healthy path of mental health.<//review>< Pics>

This place is great. Simple and clean and not too much going on. The location is very great (walking distance from MAC Arthur bart. Arianne was great. Knowledge and pretty detailed for something so simple...
She knew great places to eat at after words which was great.

I like the chamber it has a lot more space than the tanks. I drank coffee before my float and could not relax but my legs felt much better and I slept so great<//review>

A few weeks ago, I was offered an opportunity to experience the wonders of sensory Deprivation at Oakland Floats ! After she serenaded me with tea, a warm shower and my very own suit (all complimentary), she sat me down for an info session! The best part about that: it was short, sweet, and highly informative. Afterward, I floated freely in a salt water solution for about 75 minutes, and allowed any cares or worries within me to fade away! The prices are inexpensive, and geared toward helping any democratic reach zen mode, whenever! I even gifted a maternity float to a friend! Dae, thank you for putting me on to my new meditation space!</text>

<text>Surreal experience!  My senses turned off, my mind turned off, I fell into a deep sleep for about 20 minutes.  The next day, I was more efficient in both my work and workout (xfit).  The prices are reasonable, I bought the membership.<//text>< Pictures>

< Review>
The sensory deprivation tanks are a surprisingly helpful way of  shedding the built up tension, anxiety and stress of the day. I was able able to let go of my usual circular thought process and let my mind pay attention to issues that have been put on the back burner for too long. The lobby is very inviting and peaceful. The facilities were very clean and organized. I had the pleasure of being assisted by Deja who carefully explained the whole process and gave me some useful tips for having a successful first float. I will definitely be returning to Float in the near future and let the troubles of the day melt away.< /Review>

Clean facilities and I feel like a million bucks!  Upon walking in, I was greeted by a friendly receptionist who took me through the float process.  I was not sure what to ask and I felt comfortable after the walk through.  The float was quiet and deeply relaxing. Actually, I think I fell asleep!  I woke up feeling refreshed and in a peaceful meditative state.  I was much more focused and task oriented at work.< /Text>

<review>It's the only place I've floated, but it's always a good experience. It can be pretty pricey, but they will occasionally have deals like the last Wednesday of the month.

Float tanks are generally seen as tight spaces, but Oakland floats has full shower size float rooms for the claustrophobic.< /review>< Pics>

<Time>1472019682307<//Time><rating>3<//rating><Review>Amazing facility (super clean, market-fair pricing), wonderful staff (both personable and profossional) who you can tell are there to be of service.

But I give it three stars because ownership gives the impression of not only being hands off but non existent in an industry that would benefit from a personal touch. Also, I've been a member for almost a year - which included paying monthly fees, despite the fact I didn't actually use the facility for about 6 months straight, and still got charged on a single occasion for a late cancellation...not a big deal, but again, no personal touch.

I love the service Oakland Floats provides, but don't feel valued as a customer.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1472053586428, 'text': 'Hi Robin, thanks for the feedback. I agree that as a long-standing member we should have waived the late cancel fee. I will ask one of the staff to put a credit on your account. As a small business, the late cancel issue can be troublesome and we are trying to figure out the best way to deal with it. We probably get one late cancel a day, so over the course of a month that really adds up. And then spots go empty that could have been filled by someone else. We will be adjusting our prices soon and one of the things we will be adding is a different late cancel policy for members. Thanks again and I hope we see you soon.    John'}< /Resp>< gmap_id>

The one and only.
It's all about location. And they pack it all in.
It's a hardware store not a supply house.
They have a superb selection of tools and drill bits blades etc..
If they can't get it for you you really don't need it.<//Text>

An amazing amount of selection crammed into a small space. This first of all is impressive. Secondly, the people were bright and inviting. I was greeted as soon as I walked through the door and my needs were addressed in a way that wasn't overbearing either. I will remember that this place is here and I will return.<//text>

Phenomenal service! I went to the store early in the morning to get some DIY equipment, screws, plugs and some wood. Upon my request for a specific length of wood, an extremely kind and lovely female store attendants (apologies I didn’t catch her name) kindly used a hand saw to cut the wood for me. What a fantastic level of service- highly recommend!< /review>

Great little hardware store stuffed with supplies and a really helpful staff. I can always get help here. A bit more expensive than going to Home Depot, but it's so convenient if you are in the Financial District.< /text>

Great little hardware store in downtown.  Obviously not as big with the selection of a giant Home Depot out in the suburbs, but if you need tools or hardware chances are you'll find what you need here.<//Text>

Best Customer Service I have experienced in a while! I had been looking for a specific cart that I needed, forever, but turns out they were a seasonal item. I found they had one on the Ace website and I called in to this location on Tuesday and Maria said she could get it into their store by Friday morning. She even called me this morning to let me know they had it in stock. I went in, it was right there at the front desk, paid, and I was on my way :D<//Text>

<Text>This is a super convenient location!  I've come here to get keys made, pick up plastic bags, and more.  It's not just geared towards the offices that surround it (even though there is almost everything an office manager or facilities person may need).  They have gardening supplies, paint, drill bits, bulk screws, tupperware, light bulbs, and more!  I'll admit that sometimes getting keys made can take a little wait.  I had to wait about 20 minutes to get my key made since there was a pretty long queue, but I just browsed and took a mental note of everything there so I could direct others to their location if they needed something.  The staff is also very friendly and always willing to help out.</Text>< GmapID>

The visit started of great then turned out really horrible because of their service. I went in with the intention of getting key copies, looking for drill bits, looking at foam, and looking for other useful things. At first it was great with the clerks assisting me. Then turned into one of the following me around the store and also stating to the person who she was talking to on her personal cell phone (I have to watch this guy.”. After in which I tested by going to multiple isles and saw that she was following me. I am appalled and insulted that this person whom is suppose to be working is on her cell phone, rather then asking if I need help again, rather then assume I am going to steal something. I was very appalled and upset by this that my hands where trembling as I went to the counter to ask if they had key copies for the keys needed at the end. The fact of the matter is that lady shouldn’t treat her job with such disrespect by following customers assuming they are going to steal, just because it seems like she didn’t want to hang up her cell(non-work) phone and actually interact. As I left I also expressed that I was glad they didn’t have the keys, I don’t have to do business here, and will not becoming back.</text>

The best hardware store in the Park CA neighborhood. Financial District Hardware is owned and run by two brothers who can fix just about anything!< /Review>

<review>I was surprised to find a legitimate hardware store in the middle of the financial district!  They had what I was looking for when I visited - a key making machine.  For larger hardware store needs I would still recommend venturing to a suburban hardware store because overall selection seems limited.<//review><rate>4<//rate>< Name>

Edited my previous review, as I was a bit disgruntled when I wrote it...
I have been skunked multiple times assuming they would be open at a reasonable (8:30ish ) time on the day after a holiday. All I'm going to say is check the hours if you plan to go on days around holidays, as the hours may not be what you would expect.

Otherwise the gym is good. Equipment is plentiful, and in generally good repair. It's always busy, so if you like to go at a time when it's less crowded, good luck- I still haven't figured out when that would be.</text>

<Review>Fraud! This place continues to charge my account. My wife cancelled and was told to bring a letter of cancellation and did so and yet again, another Month passes and another 49$ hit my account. This place is a total Joke and no seems to have any 'authority'. Go anywhere else but here. I'm having to change my card numbers to get this place to stop charging me.

<Review>Horrible experience at this gym
For starters I use to be a member at this gym about 6 years ago I had a bad experience then but came back because they were one of 2 gyms in town with daycare.....

I was charged for the processing fee which I was told would be waved off well I found out he wrote it on the contract anyways despite what he told me so that’s my fault

I then brought my wife and sister in law because they wanted to try out the gym and potentially sign with them as well but we were treated very horrible the lady behind the desk I believe her name was Cherry could be wrong but she kept telling us to read the sign that there was no daycare because Labor Day cool got it and then when I asked about my wife and her sister wanting to try the gym and potentially sign she said no they could not even have a tour of the place despite me telling her west sac location allows a day pass she turned me away and told me to go there instead I called and canceled my membership after leaving went across town to try out another gym and they treated us 100x better and carry newer equipment the staff even allowed me the month free just for canceling my current membership and signing with them....I will never be back fitness system ever again< /Review><pics>None< /pics><Time>1535999677955< /Time>< Resp>

Broken Machines and Dirty facilities.  People walk in with work or street clothing.  None of the workers give a Sh#T about who walks in and what their doing.  Nobody repairs the broken and rusted out machines.  Showers are always dirty.  They have a laundry closet filled with lint and cleaning equipment thrown in there like no one has used it in years.  Some of the machines are new but no one cleans them.  The workers don't care!</text>

I'm so bummed to be writing this; I really wanted to like this place since it's close. All the machines and free weights are creaky, ancient, and coated in a fine layer of sweat from decades of use. They don't have cleaning sprays or wipes handy. I asked about them and they said they just have a few up near the front desk. So if you're cool working out in the sweat of other humans, this place might be a great bargain for you.< /review>

<Text>I would say there's nothing special at this facility.
One of the nice things is that it is open 24 hours a day.
One thing I do not care for is that they tend to keep the pool temperature a bit on the cool side at least in my opinion.
When I'm doing my laps I'd like to see 83 or 84 degrees of water temperature but quite often it is down in the lower 80s or upper 70s.
Water temperature around 80 or below makes it very very uncomfortable for me.</Text><resp>None</resp>< date>

<Date>1537341262319<//Date><Rating>1<//Rating><Text>Fitness system is definitely not a welcoming nor friendly gym. Their stuff members don't bother to be polite to it’s gym members and treat them poorly. To make it worse, most of their equipment is old and requires maintenance. Lastly, but not less important, they don’t allow women to show their midriff, even if all they’re showing is 1 cm of it. I never felt welcomed, and I was constantly worried about showing some skin. I believe this is an absurd policy since there are plenty of men showing most of their abdominal sections. Not just it’s absurd, but not motivational to all those women trying to feel more confident and motivated to work out and look better everyday.
I definitely don’t recommend this gym if you’re trying to feel free to wear what makes you feel comfortable and confident.<//Text>< pics>

< Review>
If I could give this gym a negative star I would, THEY ARE HORRIBLE!!!!!! DO NOT GO TO THIS GYM!  They do things with your account that they are NOT AUTHORIZED to do!!!! The gym is always dirty, the daycare is HORRIBLE. There is always pee on the floor in the bathroom in the daycare, they don't clean their area, and the daycare room is way too small for all of the kids to be in. The girls at the daycare should not be working the daycare, they don't know how to do their job effeciently and do not know how to work with kids. I REPEAT THIS GYM IS BY FAR THE ABSOLUTE WORST GYM I HAVE EVER BEEN TO IN MY ENTIRE LIFE!</Review>

<rating>1</rating><text>Lame! I just wanted to workout for a couple hours while visiting family in woodland. This place already looks dated and equipment looks second hand. Although I can’t say for sure since I could not buy a Day pass without giving them and copy of my license. why does a gym need a copy of my CADL? The gym and yoga studio I belong to doesn’t even have a copy of my license. Fitness systems staff couldn’t give me an explanation for this expect “that’s just our policy” Woodland is in need of a gym that stays open past 8pm. Won’t be going back and will gladly tell people that their policy is ridiculous and not to waste their time.</text>< pictures>

This is the best gym in town. Its got everything and its open 24 hours everyday! Its big enough to not seem crowded during peak time. It has a great selection of machines and more than enough free weights. Pool, hot tub, basketball court...worth the cost of the monthly fee...whats the monthly fee you ask? 39.00 bucks is all it costs and they gave me the first month free. No start up fees and its month to month no contract! Hope this helps you decide to come try it out.</text>

Pretty good gym but they charge $15 to bring a guest. My daughter visits 1 or 2 times a month from Modesto and that is just way too high for no apparent reason<//Text>

<rate>5</rate><Text>Yesterday I enjoyed a wonderful shopping experience at Kevin Jewelers. I was at the Outlets in San Clemente for the first time and noticed the signs for 80% off throughout this store. I was browsing out of curiosity and was excited to find a display of solar-powered Citizen watches ⌚.  They never need batteries. The stunning one I bought includes a date stamp and has a very delicate, feminine gold and diamond look. At no extra charge, one of the jewelers removed a few links from the watch, so it would fit my small wrist. I also found a lovely ring at a good price. 👍Also, one of the jewelers discussed with me the topic of used Rolexes, which are sold there. Throughout our interactions, the jewelers were consistently pleasant, informative, and professional. They are obviously highly experienced and knowledgeable about the products they sell, and were eager to help me find jewelry that I wanted, at a reasonable price point. Additional warranties were offered on the items purchased, and although I declined, I thought they were a good value. In particular, I came in not wanting to buy a ring, as I usually buy only adjustable rings. But here at Kevin Jewelers, I found a gorgeous ring that fit perfectly and had to have it! Chalk that up to the wide selection  of rings offered for sale, at a variety of colors, styles, and prices. Do yourself a favor and shop here for jewelry or watches ⌚.  You may well find one or more pieces that you can't live without.</Text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>{'time': 1615855057285, 'text': 'Hi Ava, we are delighted that you had such a great experience!

He was a great person and trust worthy. He knew what i wanted right when i explained my ideal ring and he showed me a couple rings that he knew were exactly my taste. I was amazed and ended up picking my ring right away! He was a really good salesman and he immediately builds that relationship with a customer.</review>< Pics>

We had a wonderful experience at the Kevin Jewelers in San Clemente.  The staff was very helpful and very supportive of our daughter that is a new Marine.  She has been stationed at Camp Pendelton for a little over a month, and we were looking at gold chains that were longer than the one we bought her with a cross pendant, as she was being called out by superiors for the necklace being out of regulations as it could be seen.  We were able to find a great chain at a very good price, and our daughter was very happy with it.  We were also able to purchase some lifetime coverage for the necklace that she could use anywhere that she ultimately gets stationed if there was any breakage or other issues experienced.</text>

The sales associate was extremely informative , patient, and helped us find exactly what we were looking for, as well as info on how to take care of the piece that I purchased. I would go back for other diamond buys and to browse. Great experience at the San Clemente Outlet store. Thank you.<//Review>

We originally purchased the wedding bands in Lakewood and when we purchased them we were told they would be ready in 4 weeks.  We had to call for the rings after the arranged due date and were told they would be ready the week of the planned event.  Then I called again because many businesses were being shut down due to the corona virus.  My problem with all the delays is the lack of communication and because we were getting married tomorrow and the rings were already purchased, I had to email the business to see where we can pickup the rings.  In order to get the the rings on the due date, we had to drive to San Clemente...as soon as the Lakewood store knew they were closing it was their responsibility to notify us of alternatives to be taken, instead we had to be tortured believing that we wouldn't get them on time...luckily we decided to email for an alternative because we believe that you probably would've just let it go without taking us into account.</Text>

Beyond happy with Kevin jewelers! We went in browsing ideas for my girlfriends engagement ring and we were greeted by a very friendly staff. They were very patient and gave us so many wonderful options for our price range. Philip especially was awesome and very knowledgeable. They made the whole process easy and we are very happy! Thanks again to your awesome staff at this location!</Review>

< Review>
My boyfriend and I stumbled upon this place while we were at an outlet mall. We originally came to the mall to visit Zales and walked into Kevin's to price compare.

Kevin's ended up having the exact ring my boyfriend wanted so we decided to go ahead and purchase it. I got my ring as well. Prices seemed consistent with other stores and we liked the lifetime warranty that comes with purchasing from a well known store (though I had never heard of them until now).

The only issue we had was the salesperson quoted us a price that included the lifetime warranty and then when after they ran our card, we saw they had charged us extra $99 for it. I don't know if it was a communication issue or a salesperson deception. We think the latter. That is the reason for only 3 stars.

Once our rings arrive I may update this review. Fingers crossed there are no issues. They are supposed to be having them sent to a store closer to us. Mine will take a couple days and his up to a month since they have to special order his size 14. All in all we are happy to have our rings and move on to honeymoon planning.</Review>

I am an extremely blessed and happy customer today as  I chose to come in to Kevin Jewelers this morning and I must say that I was greeted by Farzad Shoja a wonderful, caring and incredible Jewelry consultant along with Cassy who is  also absolutely wonderful and incredible Jewelry Consultant! Farzad and Cassy both went beyond my expectations and both are so incredibly sweet!!!!   I ask Kevin Jewelers to recognize Farad and Cassy in every way that Kevin Jewelers does recognize their very best employees!!! I was treated like family!!!
Everyone looking for the very best Jewelry and the very best experience must go to Kevin Jewelers in San Clemente, California in the outlet mall!!! I am so absolutely thankful for these two incredible miracles Farzad and Cassy!
I want everyone to know how incredibly wonderful experience was and it was only made possible because of Farzad and Cassy!

I just purchased a Citizen watch here and was told I had to take it to a store in the Mission Viejo mall to get it properly sized. They should've given me a work order to present at the other store but they failed to do so. Thankfully the other store honored the free sizing.</Review>

< Review>
I travel often in 3 different Counties, in SoCal and eventually do business with many retailers (chain and independent). Today, I found KEVIN JEWELERS, San Clemente. I realized, each time I Bodyboard in Ocean I must remember to leave my wedding ring off (reasons vary- salt water, rocks, strong current/waves)... So, I stopped in and purchased a specific Gold Band in which I will wear for my sports. Gita M. And additional female associate were exceptional. I value both Gita and the additional jeweler's knowledge and respect the demeanor demonstrated. I highly recommend KEVIN JEWELERS for any purchase, and any budget.<//Review>

<text>The worst jewelry store ever ! Customer service is horrible ! I purchased a diamond ring in November and within less than 30 days  a large doom and had fallen off ! Took the ring for repair and was given a smaller lesser quality diamond ! After a 3rd time I got a call my ring was back but with the same situation ! Until today, I still don’t have my ring ! Don’t trust I even get a diamond back ! When I called asking for management I was told no no last name or contact number could be provided to me and wait until my ring is ready ! If you could avoid Kevin Jewelers please do yourself a favor a DO! Poor service all the way around and fraud!</text><pics>None<//pics><response>{'time': 1548459953602, 'text': "Hi Olympia, thank you for your feedback.

My absolute favorite donut shop. I love their #4 breakfast sandwich. Get extra jalapeno if that's your thing. You won't regret it. Only down side is, if your like me and go in at 4:45am, chocolate bars are not ready ! 😰 But aside from that, they have great donuts< /Text>

My family and I have been going to Richard's donuts for years now. They've never been anything but kind to us. Their donuts are delicious and their croissant sandwiches...yum!  😋 A little advice, you have to go before 10:30, otherwise you will find yourself disappointed since they sell out FAST.< /review>

<Review>Honestly I didn't know what to expect walking in. I was pleasently surprised by the friendliness of the staff, the other guests, and the tastiness of the donuts themselves. The staff had my order of 2 dozen donuts boxed up in less than 2 minutes and I was back out the door within a total of 3 minutes. I couldn't have asked for a better visit. I'll be back soon for sure!</Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

I have never had a bad experience. They’re all so welcoming and they always make sure you’re happy with the results. I am amazed because not everyone treats you like a friend. Some people just give you the service and bye, like they’re not humble, they don’t care if you’re happy or not with their service. These people make sure you are satisfied  and hoping that you come back. iThread is where you go when you want your eyebrows well done for sure!! 😉👌 Trust me, I can be picky!</text><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

< Review>
I started going here after other eyebrow places continued to make my eyebrows thinner and thinner. I let them grow out for months and finally went to iThread and let Angie know my situation and how I wanted to grow them out so they could be thicker again and she was very helpful and worked with me to get them to how I wanted. I’ve been going here for about 4 months now and I love it everybody is very friendly and I’ve only had to wait once which was the day before thanksgiving. Overall they’re very good at what they do and pay close attention to detail which is my favorite characteristic of this shop.</Review>

<Text>This is the only place I trust to do my eyebrows. They were voted best in Marino Valley for their threading service and it’s because they are the best in Moreno Valley hands down. I took my daughter to get her eyebrows done for the first time and she loves how they turned out. She keeps telling me how much she likes them!<//Text>< pictures>

< Review>
They are cheap, so if you want to clean your eyebrow definitely go there. I won’t return though, because I know how to clean my eyebrow the thing I can’t is shaping and styling, honestly, they can’t help you with that.
Anyway, maybe if you have a picture of eyebrow that you want might help it didn’t for me because the person who did mine, didn’t even look at it; but the other person did a better job on my friend’s eyebrow and kind of tried to styled it like what she saw in the picture. Anyway, we both agreed that we ourselves could do a better job, and won’t return for the next time.
They are so nice and friendly, I am sad that I wasn’t satisfied.<//Review>

<rating>5<//rating><Text>The only place I let touch my brows. Communicate what you want and they will do their job. Really inexpensive, $8 for brow only. I recommend Sabina and one other girl - can't remember her name. She has brown skin and dark hair. Both of them are really good. I normally go towards the end of day on Sundays, no line. Don't forget to tip!<//Text>< pictures>

This place is legit, totally radical! Bring all your cans and bottles from all your ragers here. I think they have a coupon or something if you come and ask OK.< /Text>

I conveyed to him the lady said $0.20 a pound. His response, “Oh well”. Mind you, these are clean aluminum wheels from a Chevy truck. No stem. No weight. No dirt.

Everything is organized. They get you in & out. Don't go just before or after a holiday.  Not a ton of parking, but a good amount. I'll never go to another place & wait for cans.</review>

I came into a lot of different scrap materials. I spent a days separating items. I looked online read some reviews and called a couple. West Coast was tje furthest from my home, but the girl who answered my call was very polite and helpful. My last question ess what time do you close. Im sitting in the parking lot outside writing this review i showed up at 3:51pm at no time on my call was i instructed you will be turned away by dome guy with a mask laughing and waiving his finger no no. He was letting someone out. I am in Fullerton drove pass to centers to drive out here. I would never recommend this business and i was management i would be very selective on who decides who to turn away during operating hours. The best part the gentleman who J Walked across Commonwealth which i arrived before this gentleman was not turned away when the giggling finger waiver opened the gate. What a waste of my time</text>

It's a great place to come, because the employees quickly get your stuff weighed, then you're on your way! Be sure to request the VIP card, in order to get a little more money, per pound.</review>

I just looked up the coupon that he is referring too and it expired October 31, 2015. So yeah if he's trying to use a coupon past an expiration date they won't except it. Read the fine print. I'm going to go there soon never been but wanted to clarify the coupon issue.<//text>

<text>I have an idea of the weight of things because I sell products online and I weight products for shipping every day. I cleaned my garage, I got 4 pieces of metal stuff with a total of at least 150 pounds. The guy who weighted the stuff was doing some weird things. They said that it was only 42 pounds. I didn't have time to argue, I just left and I will never go back there.< /text><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None<//response><Gmap_id>0x80dd2a4a6d27b2ab:0x327790f8898249dd</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Rate>4< /Rate><review>(Translated by Google) Buena Park, Fullerton and La Mirada are the only places to handle recycled items, so it's crowded in the morning and we recommend you visit them in the afternoon.

Our pizza was really delicious, however I was a bit surprised to pay $49 for a two topping large, a large half combo half cheese and 12 wings. Delivery was 1 mile away. No receipt was given.
Seems like it was expensive.< /text>

I could not be more impressed with my experience with happy jewelers. My fiancé & I will be forever customers! Josh absolutely killed it with my wedding band & was a pleasure to work with. There was a minor concern with my engagement ring & the customer service we received was above & beyond. Gabe & josh made sure everything was perfect. Thank you guys so much for making this experience so fun ! Can’t wait to build our jewelry  collection with more of their amazing pieces!</text>

<Text>Happy Jewelers is THE BEST place for jewelry shopping. My husband purchased my engagement ring from them and has since bought two wedding bands as well. The service is impeccable and they are truly on top of every detail when working with their customers. We were in a tight situation and needed our order in a short amount of time and Pete did so well to ensure our ring was made and ready in less than 3 weeks. Cannot recommend this store or give them a better review. Don't go anywhere else!</Text>< Pics>

<review>We had the best experience with Josh replacing the center stone of my engagement ring that was lost. The whole process was very straight forward. He was excellent at explaining the stone quality and helping us figure out exactly what we wanted. Thank you. We will definitely come back.</review>< Pics>

3 words: Best. In. Class. Listen to the reviews and RUN (don’t walk) to this store! They’re at the top of every list for a reason! Pete provided hands down THE BEST customer service we’ve ever received. We were new engagement ring shoppers and were pretty overwhelmed when we first stepped into Happy... until we found Pete. Pete gave us endless diamond knowledge, honest and sincere feedback, and a comfortable environment to compare every option. We went back and forth for hours across two separate visits. Pete and the entire team at Happy made us feel like family every minute that we were there. If the service alone isn’t enough for you, the selection and pricing is also unmatched - we shopped around quite a bit and no one could touch the quality or the pricing at Happy. We made our final purchase at Happy and we’ve never been so sure of such a large decision. We can’t wait to come back for years to come! We will be telling anyone and everyone who will listen to come to Happy. Thank you to Pete and the whole Happy Jewelers team from the bottom of our hearts. We will cherish and remember our experience forever!</Review>

<Text>If you have a vision, Happy Jewelers makes it a reality! Danny and his team of designers reset my halo engagement ring and matching band into this STUNNING knife edge design. The workmanship is beyond superb! Danny took a personal and vested interest in what I wanted, created a mold, and ultimately casted my vision into reality. I can't keep my eyes off of my amazing "new" beautiful ring - I absolutely love it!

I cannot say enough great things about Happy Jewelers. My latest purchase with them was an anniversary gift for my boyfriend. I asked them to recreate his passed father’s necklace and they recreated it perfectly!! The necklace was very specific so I sent them pictures and they were amazing to communicate with. They understood how important this was to me to get this necklace right, and it turned out amazing. He loves it and it will always remind him of his father! He also bought my anniversary gift at Happy Jewelers and I love it! Its a gold heart locket necklace with a K engraved on the front. It is so special to me. I will definitely keep purchasing from Happy Jewelers!</Review>

I have worked with Gabe and his staff at Happy Jewelers for 20 years now.  Their work is impeccable. Gabe knows i am very fussy about my jewelry and he always manages to make me happy. Excellent quality. Excellent prices.  One of my favorite pieces was a 4 ct orange sapphire that Gabe designed a vintage setting because he knew how much I loved that. He worked with my husband and they surprised me.  Another beautiful gift was a necklace that matched a ring I have. I opened it on Christmas and immediately said it matches my ring!  Gabe had done that not my husband.  With all of his clients he actually remembered my jewelry and suggested the gift to my client.  They stand behind their work and they stand behind their products.  I highly, highly recommend Happy Jewelers!  You will never be disappointed!</Text>

The quality and service is always exceptional, I bought my wife’s wedding band here when it was Newport Jewelers some 7 years ago, Gabe and his bro have always taken care of me, they can do some amazing custom work and the quality is above the rest. I highly recommended checking out Happy Jeweler especially if you have a design in mind they can help to bring it to life through many years of experience and being well know on the jewelry industry.< /Review>

Honestly, Happy Jewelers is so solid! I had been to a handful of other places both big and small stores. The sales people at HJ are super helpful, non pressuring and honest. Elaine was awesome! Easy to work with. Hayley and Lupita came over to help give their opinions, which were super helpful. I’ve referred my friends and family to Happy Jewelers because they’re the best! The ring I got for my fiancé was perfect! It was the cleanest and best Diamond I found out there. The pricing was comparable to other places but the stones are all real. Don’t go cheap and buy a lab created, get some value in a real diamond. If you’re cool and honest they will usually do their best in working with your price range. Go there and make your significant other happy!!<//Review>

Happy Jewelers is always taking care of you when you go in. They always make sure you are comfortable in the store and they go that extra step to make sure you are happy with your experience there. I purchased fiancé’s engagement ring and we purchased my bands from here. We will be back for my fiancé’s band as well as other great jewelry. I high recommend coming to this store if you are looking for a really good experience purchasing some jewelry.<//text>

I appreciate Happy Jewlers staff for their personalized approach and exceptional price for reattaching my wedding ring diamond within hours. They also cleaned my other jewelry while my ring was being repaired.  I even left with a bag of goodies so that I can continue to keep my jewelry clean and sparkling at no additional cost. A great experience, trustworthy .. a busy place with enough staff to care for all the customers and why I will return and have recommended them to my family and friends.  Thanks again 🥰<//Review>

To be honest my experience wasn't that great. I wanted to buy a gold chain and after doing some research decided on Happy Jewelers. I bought a 14k gold chain at what I later found out to be was a 40% mark up of what the actual gold is worth. In the end that's my luck for not doing more research on the value of gold, but I had no idea I'd need to be educated in jewelry shopping to not be ripped off here. Chains nice though so there's that, but odds are if you're new to doing jewelry shopping you may get overcharged.< /Text>

Every piece of jewelry is absolutely stunning and I would always show my husband all of the beautiful pieces. Back in September, he bought me my first custom name necklace from Happy Jewelers! It was so stunning and unique❤️ I couldn’t wait for his birthday because I knew I would be looking purchasing a chain through Happy Jewelers! Being that I’m out of state, I was nervous as I wouldn’t be able to touch/see the chains in person but thankfully I worked with Hayley who was extremely helpful.

Absolutely LOVE the attention to detail from Happy Jewelers. Gabe and his team really know how to take care of all customers. No matter how large or small your purchase is they will always treat you as if your the only one at the store. My husband and I have been going to them for over 10 years now and we don’t plan on going anywhere else for our jewelry needs. Congratulations on the new location it looks amazing and you deserve it Happy Jewelers! Thank you for the great prices and wonderful quality pieces you provide us customers.<//Text>

<rating>5</rating><Text>Happy Jewelers has officially won me over as a lifetime customer. Their customer service truly sets them apart from others. We came in without a specific design in mind and even though they were packed with customers, Hayley dedicated her time and attention to making sure we got exactly what we wanted. They were accurate to their quoted manufacturing time and their pricing is phenomenal given the high quality and craftsmanship. We’ve gone back a couple times since and every time we are treated with consistently outstanding service. Danny also deserves a special shoutout for his attention and help in guiding us through the process. Don’t be overwhelmed by the crowds, they are in the process of getting their own store nearby and truly, they are worth the wait (I’ve been there when I haven’t had to wait at all- depends on their high traffic times).</Text>< date>

We love Gabe & the entire team at Happy Jeweler! They’re all so friendly, patient and knowledgeable. They have a way of making you feel special and thoroughly enjoy what they do! We purchased my engagement ring and our wedding bands and they made such an exciting time in our lives out to be such an exceptional experience. Their quality is second to none and they absolutely stand by all their products. They’re confident in the product/work they perform and it surely shows in the quality. We will always go to Happy Jeweler and recommend them to everyone!</Text>

<time>1605554733061<//time><Rating>5</Rating><review>I've been going to Happy Jewelers for just over a decade now. I was initially introduced to them by my uncle when I was looking for a watch. I had a great experience, the people were super helpful and did not pressure me at all. Years later, I went back for my engagement ring. Again, had an excellent experience. My now wife had some ring questions, she visited them, and came home delighted with her experience. She echoed their helpfulness in answering her questions, and never pushed her just to make a sale or towards a more expensive item. I go back from time to time for smaller gifts and whenever I'm asked for jeweler recommendations, I send them to Happy Jewelers.<//review><username>Ricardo Morales<//username>< Response>

I worked with Armida to create a beautiful custom engagement ring.  She took my ideas, added her suggestions, and really brought my idea to life.  My fiance is thrilled with this piece, and I know she cherishes the quality of her ring.  We are currently working with her on the wedding bands, and the process is really fun.  I am a happy jeweler customer for life.</text>

She was so lovely to work with and was quick to respond, sent me pictures and videos, answered all my questions and was very professional.

I contacted them through their website a month ago and Brianna contacted me through text the following day. She was very helpful in answering my questions and responding in a timely manner. She also helped me find the perfect diamond in my budget. My ring had to be custom made and was told it would take 4-6 weeks. Today marks the 4th week and the ring was ready to be picked up. I am so incredibly happy! The ring came out perfectly and I am 110% satisfied. I can’t stop staring at my ring 😍 thank you so much for the amazing service and ring of my dreams. I will be back!< /Review>< Pics>

<Text>The best place in Southern California for all of your Jewelry needs. Great selection and great customer service. Attention to detail is clearly prioritized. Pricing is more than reasonable and better than any big box store. When you visit this location you will see why their counter is exceptionally busy compared to the surrounding counters.<//Text>< user_id>

<review>Happy Jewelers is my jeweler for life! Danny and Gabe as well as the whole crew Pete, Molly etc. are amazing!  It is rare to get this level of customer service anywhere let alone at a jeweler.  Danny and Gabe can literally find you anything. I kid you not, they found me an old school 24k gold & black Breitling Bentley with the gator strap. This was the exact watch I had my eye on for years, but I couldn't find it from a reliable source just shady folks on the internet. These guys went ABOVE and BEYOND to get the perfect watch and then followed it up with a custom Cuban/earrings/pendant for me and my wife. My loyalty has to be earned, and I wouldn't go anywhere else but Happy Jewelers.</review>< userid>

<review>The hype is real. After looking at what seemed hundreds of different engagement rings and jewelers, I decided to work with Happy Jewelers. I worked with Molly, who took the time to answer many questions lol After looking at rings on a Saturday, I made the purchase that following Monday. The ring arrived before I was going to propose to my now fiancé and wow, I couldn't have been happier with the overall experience. My fiancé LOVES the ring, and so do her friends and family. We will for sure be repeat customers at Happy Jewelers in the future. Molly is so great to work with and would highly recommend working with her!< /review>< name>

I've know Gabe and Daniel for years. When the time came for me to purchase an emgagement ring they were the first people I called. While I was there they showed me many options and answered any questions I had. Very knowledgeable. It was a great experience.

Took my finance there when it was time to purchase our wedding rings and that was awesome as well.<//text>

<Review>I love this place. When we first got engaged this is where we got the engagement ring and wedding band for my now wife. We keep coming back for best prices and service. The brothers who own this place are super knowledgeable and patient. We bought a number of items here and simply couldn’t be happier. Every time we go they also offer to clean my wife’s wedding band at no charge. They really take care of their customers.</Review>< Pictures>

<Review>Every purchase has been a Wonderful experience. I contact Lupe at Happy Jewelers whenever I am looking for a gift for family, friends or just for me. Lupe help me with a custom designed engagement ring. She has always been concerned about my satisfaction rather than making a sale and how much I am willing to spend. That seems to be the culture found at Happy Jewelers and, in my humble opinion, the reason that most of their sales comes from returning customers. They look to satisfy a customer and get them exactly what they are looking for while staying within your budget Level. No pressure or hard sales tactics, just good business and standing behind there product. Thank you Lupe and all the folks at Happy Jewelers.< /Review><pics>None</pics><Resp>None</Resp>< gmapID>

I absolutely love the new stuff that I bought from them and also things that they have upgraded for me and turned out to be so beautiful and exactly what I’ve asked for. The prices are unbeatable and the customer service is the best I’ve had buying all my jewelry. I cannot wait to go back and look at a rose gold Rolex. That is the next piece that I am going to purchase from only Happy Jewelers.
Thank you so much Gabe, you’ve done a great job building this business and top of the line customer service. I can’t wait to see all of you again.

Happy Jewelers is by far the best jeweler in all of Southern California. It’s a great family run business. Gabe, Danny and staff are honest, friendly, knowledgeable, and make you feel like family as well. They can accommodate any price range from big to small. They really take their time working with you to make sure you find exactly what you are looking for. You won’t ever leave there questioning your purchase or wondering if you made the right decision or not. I was the type to always get a few quotes on everything I buy, especially jewelry. Happy Jewelers has always beaten the price from other jewelry companies and it’s not even close. I have been coming to them for years now. Believe me,  once you go in there and find out for yourselves, you won’t ever have to worry about finding a jeweler ever again. I know I have mine for life and it’s Happy Jewelers!!!</review>

Happy Jewelers have been my trusted go to for nearly 20 years. Both Gabe, Daniel and their wonderful staff have treated me like family. Their designs are stunning yet affordable. Over the years they have created gorgeous jewelry pieces for many of my friends and family for all occasions such as wedding, anniversary, birthday and graduations. It is a pleasure to have such knowledgeable and trustworthy jewelers who create memories that last a lifetime!</Text>

Amazing business! Amazing customer service! And best of all; amazing product! Have always treated me like a high rolling customer even thought my purchases don't reflect that. I have brought and recommended about half a dozen people to them and will continue to do so because of the professionalism. I only buy jewelry from Happy Jewlers!</Review>

I found them through Instagram and I had to go see them. I went with my husband and we picked out my new rings Because sadly I lost my other rings on a Hawai’i trip. They were so sweet and kind very attentive and were listening to everything you had to say, ever since I buy all my jewelry with them it’s addicting buying from them they have the cutest things and very affordable prices. They have the best customer service hands down please dont ever change that ❤️<//text>

Danny from Happy Jewelers was amazing to us the whole process. He was patient, answered all of our questions, and let us steer the process as much as we wanted while also giving valuable direction. When the time of the engagement came, and Danny saw that the ring was not going to be delivered to the store in time for me to pick up as originally planned, he took it upon himself to drive to downtown LA, pick up the ring, and hand deliver it to my apartment in South LA. I was floored at the level of customer service. They also continued to follow up with me after the purchase was made, and they even clean the rings (of my wife's and mine) for free when we drop by. Would ABSOLUTELY choose them as my Jeweler for life.<//text>

<Review>I was referred by my hairdresser who has gorgeous jewelry & after walking in to the jewelry mart & seeing their site packed with people when the other sites were empty, I had hight hopes. A pair of diamond earrings later, I referred them to 2 friends, who also bought jewelry! I haven’t been for awhile, but, I’m getting in the mood! Can’t wait to see their new store!< /Review></record></dataset><record>

Happy Jewelers is hands down the best place for quality jewelry and fine watches. As long as they’re in business I won’t go anywhere else. Their prices are simply hard to believe and their service is amazing. Just stepping foot in the center where they are located is proof. Their counter is always buzzing with crowds while all the other adjacent vendors are sitting there staring at their phones.<//Review>

Great service. Works within your budget. No hidden fees or upcharges. Does not pressure sell at all. I have bought multiple items from Happy Jewelers and have been satisfied every time.  We had 1 problem where an opal cracked and half of it was missing and the replaces it with a similar stone no charge. I have not bought jewelry from anyone else in over 15 years.<//Review>

We LOVE Happy Jewelers! We’ve been going to them for close to 10 years and wouldn’t trust anybody else with any of our jewelry needs. They’re the kindest, most generous and trustworthy jewelers. They create incredible one of a kind pieces and if you need a specific watch they’re the ones to go to in order to find it. Have a repair? They take care of everything easily and with masterful expertise. Always a pleasure working with the whole crew and Danny and Gabe are truly remarkable people and jewelers. A+++++ all the way.<//review>

Happy Jewelers has the best service we have had at a jewelry store. I’ve bought a beautiful gold chain for my husband, had a treasured pendent reworked, had several rings sized, had the stone in a class ring replaced and sold gold to them for a very fair price. We’ll be back soon!< /Text>

Happy Jewelers was the best decision I made when getting my fiancée her perfect ring. They were receptive to your needs, offer great advice, and the price point is super reasonable. I would recommend Happy Jewelers, specifically Hayley for anyone looking to get any piece of jewelry! My fiancée went back to them for my ring and we are in awe with both pieces. Thank you so much to all at Happy Jewelers!<//text>

Purchased an engagement ring through Gabe Arik, he was unbelievable.  Answered every call, responded by text.  Sent pictures and videos.  We were looking for a specific diamond, he found it and it was more gorgeous then we could imagine.  The ring is so stunning, I have no words.  He was the best jeweler I have ever dealt with, I would highly recommend.  His price was amazing.</Text>

The Happy Jeweler team is the best of the best.  The jeweler is family owned and operated and because of it, every customer gets treated like family.  The quality of the jewelry is unsurpassed.  Their pricing is second to none.  Most importantly, the Happy Jeweler team is extremely trustworthy.</Text>

<Rate>5<//Rate><review>Happy Jewelry did an amazing job for me and helped me put together an engagement ring that my  fiance loves. I had a trip planned with my girlfriend and dragged my feet to buy the ring. I went to Happy Jewelry with an idea of what my girlfriend would like based on what her best friend told me. They spent time showing me bands and stones until we got close to the combination that I thought my girlfriend would like. While I was still in the shop my girlfriend's best friend sent me photos. After that we got fully dialed in. Happy Jewelry listened to what I wanted and built me ring that matched my vision completely (including an engraving on the band).  Growing up my brother was really close with one of the owners Gabe who has always remained a family friend. When it was time to buy an engagement ring I found a way to get his cell number from my mom's ancient phone book while visiting.  I spoke to friends who had just bought engagement rings and did some online research. However, I wanted a professional that works in that field that I could trust to make sure I got things right. I did not want to become a diamond expert and buy it online. Gabe was that professional and they did a great! My fiance's dad got a hold of me to say congratulations and then made a point of saying how nice the ring looks.<//review>< Pics>

<rate>5</rate><Review>I first bought my wife’s engagement ring after she saw her friend’s engagement ring and fell in love with it. I’ve since returned to purchase several other pieces for her. I can’t say enough good things about the personal service I always receive. I have the utmost trust in these guys. They stand by their work and continue to clean / service all pieces I have purchased. This is the only jeweler I would even consider visiting.

If I could rate 6 stars I would because I can’t think Armida and the Happy Jewelers staff enough. My fiancé loves her ring, and there’s not a day strangers don’t compliment it. We will be buying jewelry from this company for many years to come.< /Review>

He was very knowledgeable and professional.   Both watches were pre-owned (Tag & Rolex).  Both were priced right and in pristine condition just like the online description...NO SURPRISES!  Shipping was fast even during this pandemic.  Now I understand why Happy Jewelers has so many rave reviews.  They are well deserved.  They exceeded my expectations.< /review></record>

My wife's rings are gorgeous and we are both so happy with them. Happy Jewelers custom made both the engagement ring and the wedding band and they look so beautiful. The staff is always extremely helpful and friendly; I cannot recommend them enough. They even helped me fix my grandfathers tie pin! Thank you so much for your great service and beautiful jewelry.</Review>

I have been a satisfied and grateful customer of Happy Jewelers for more than 20 years! Gabe and the "Happy Jewelers Family" has always provided me with concierge services and regarded me with kindness.

Happy Jewelers has consistently demonstrated appreciation for my loyalty by assisting me with all of my jewelry services, extending great prices and greeting me with a smile. If you want quality jewelry and quality service make Happy Jewelers your personal place to shop!</review>

I’ve been buying jewelry from Danny and Gabe for many years now - always referring friends and family with confidence. I’ve dealt with many many different jewelers in the past, but no one comes close to these guys when it comes to quality, service, price, and attention to detail. The business successfully thrives off referrals - definitely check them out.<//Review>
</record></dataset><record>
<review>These guys are great! I am sadly not loyal to salespeople and I am one. I have been helped by 3 different people here and each one has taken great care. I went in and had a thought in my head of what I wanted for an engagement ring and they made it happen, custom and flawless. They are working on a perfect match wedding band. I also went in and found a wedding band for me that same day. Awesome service fair prices and high quality!< /review><time>1495738238134</time><Rating>5</Rating><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOHFQG3bfzuLA4h9H87Z3hqXHWjK8832W_6OSws=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics>< user_id>

<Review>Happy Jewelers was referred to me so I decided to pay them a visit. After meeting Gabe and Danny I knew I made the right choice. This team has to be one of the best when it comes to customer service and honesty. I traded in my 2 Rolex watches and received a great offer on both. Thank you guys for helping me find my new beautiful Rolex Submariner. I will definitely be back when I’m ready to upgrade to my next one.

Thank you both,

If you want it done right and by the best go see Gabe and the Team at Happy Jewelers. Gabe was referred to me and when I met him he was above and beyond helpful in designing an engagement ring. The crazy part, I ended up ordering the ring 8 months later and he knew exactly every detail of what we discussed months ago. With that said, Gabe truly wants you and your special someone to be happy with what you pick and/or what is designed.  5 stars doesn’t do Gabe and Happy Jewelers justice as its 5+ without question. More importantly for me and my fiancée we have a jeweler for life and a great group of people who aren’t just trying to make money. Thank you Gabe and Happy Jewelers!!!!< /text>

We had our ring resized at Happy Jewelers today. They resized our ring in less than two hours. The price was much cheaper than any jewelers around! A guy who helped us was Alex I think. He was very helpful and friendly. I strongly recommand coming here to get jewelries or get jewelries fixed. Thank you Alex and Happy Jewelers! You made our day😁<//review>

Happy jewelers is seriously the best! Gabe and his staff were super friendly and accommodating. They even delivered the ring to my office with no extra fee! My fiancé is in love with her engagement ring and I can’t thank them enough. Pricing was more than fair and their quality of service was top notch. Highly recommended 👍<//Review>

I live in CT, literally the opposite side of the country. But Happy Jewelers was better over the phone than many jewelers were that I went to in person here. I was helped by an amazing associate named Elaine. She worked with me through the whole process, found me the perfect stone and made the setting of my girl’s dreams. Everything was done quick and on time and they even helped me with financing even though usually they do not do financing for out of state customers. I will DEF be going back for my Fiance’s Wedding band too. Thanks so much you guys and especially you Elaine!< /Text>

Gabe and the free are the most incredible group of individuals. They take care of every person that comes to their shop and truly focus on the needs of the customer. They are MILITARY FRIENDLY! My husband and I are both active and I almost fell over when Gabe told me what discount he was giving us. We are SO grateful and I stare at my rings everyday - sometimes in disbelief that I own such beautiful pieces. I wish I could stay in California for Happy Jewelers alone! I’ve already shared my story with so many friends. They will always WOW you!!< /Review>

<Text>Wow, wow, wow!!! My fiancée has not stopped smiling since she saw the ring. I could not have found a more perfect ring and to top it off it was right at my budget. Everyone that helped me was so helpful, especially Hayley, she was great at communicating with quick responses about any questions. 10/10 recommend to a friend, no lie this was the first place I went to find a ring and I wouldn't have had to go anywhere else.

I’ve purchased my wedding band and other jewelry from Happy Jewelers, and I’m obsessed with every single piece! I’ve even had old jewelry remade with them and their work is always impeccable! They are so knowledgeable and really want to make sure you are 100% satisfied with their product. Couldn’t be happier with their work. Thanks Happy Jewelers!< /review>

We love Happy Jewelers! My husband & I went in totally clueless on what we wanted for our engagement & wedding rings and walked out happier than we walked in. We’ve referred a handful of family & friends to HP for business and they’ve all had the same experiences. Nothing short of great! Gabe & the girls are our family now. Everytime we walk in or text, he takes great care of us. Thank you Happy Jewelers for your amazing services!</text>

Very professional and great customer service! I was able to get credit for a few rings I had and I upgraded an average diamond ring to a stunning diamond! I also received a EGL USA certificate and the appraisal summary.  Diamond was Appraised for More than double of the purchased price. 😀 very happy customer.<//Text>

My wife has never been happier with rings on her fingers. They’re better than advertised. This ring is a great compliment to her wedding ring. Can’t beat the prices or the quality. Thank you Happy Jewelers!< /Review>

The people here are very nice and attentive. You show Gabe a picture of anything, he can make it!   I have recommended to many people. Shop around, get prices then go to Happy Jewelers, he will match or beat that price. You will NOT be disappointed!  Always my first choice. Thanks Gabe-< /Review>

<pics>None<//pics><text>I wanted to get my wife a new ring for our 10 year anniversary.  I shopped around and compared diamond prices and quality and also the trustworthiness of the vendors as I have been taken advantage of before.  I found Happy Jewelers and couldn’t have been happier.  Korrin met with me multiple times to ensure I found the right ring and her service and the service of the entire staff was top notch!  I have already sent a friend and a family member there for their diamond needs and highly recommend them to anyone looking for a great deal and an honest dealer.<//text><Response>None<//Response>< Date>

Happy Jewelers is the best! They helped my (now) husband design the most perfect ring for me!! And even got the size right just from looking at a picture of me!  We have gone in a bunch to pick out wedding bands, earrings, and other jewelry. Gabe, Danny, and the entire staff are always so helpful to us. We have recommended a bunch of friends to Happy Jewelers and will continue to do so :)< /Review>

There's no words to explain the experience you get with Happy Jewelers , they treat you like family and the prices are unbeatable.  I wouldn't buy jewelry anywhere else.  When you go to Happy Jewelers make sure you try the home made cookies 😊< /review>

<rating>5< /rating><Text>I was looking for a ring for my daughter for Rosary Day at her school (the girls are presented with their class ring). I was looking at a few local jewelers and was disappointed in the quality given the price. I remembered hearing about Happy Jewelers and decided to go there. My daughter and I were down right giddy at the selection in our price range, so much so, that I was more than happy to spend a little more to get her a ring she can enjoy forever, and not just as a young girl. Thank you Armida at Happy Jewelers.< /Text><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None< /Resp><Gmap_id>0x80dcd601d0029277:0xffb037f7b55943c< /Gmap_id></record>

Happy Jewelers is absolutely amazing. Every time I walk in to see them I am treated like the #1 priority no matter how many clients they have to tend to. They made my engagement ring, wedding band, my husbands wedding band, and multiple other gifts for friends and family and each piece has been nothing but perfection. Each & every employee as well the owners are so kind & personal. I would recommend them to anyone & everyone!!!<//Review>

<Text>You absolutely can't find a better place for custom jewelry designs, wedding rings, watches and repairs.  I've been going to Happy Jewelers for the past few years and their prices can't be beat. Gabe and Danny are the best and so great to work with. They treat their customers like gold and they do whatever it takes to make them happy. They are a class act and a company I'm proud to deal with. Thank you for all you do to make our jewelry dreams come to life.< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

Happy Jewelers produced every detail I expected on the engagement ring I asked for. I could not be happier with what Korrin helped me design and I could not thank Gabe for ensuring I got what I asked for.

I will never go to another jeweler other than Happy Jewelers. There is no other business as professional, empathetic, and compassionate as the jewelers at Happy Jewelers.

Thank you, thank you, thank you!!<//text>

They are amazing at what they do, very knowledgeable and extremely friendly. They made the process of designing a ring simple and exciting. I love my family engagement ring so much that I went back for my wedding ending band...and a couple more pieces because why not!

Thanks Happy Jewelers!</review>

Happy Jewelers was recommended to me a dear friend- I had many pieces of nice jewelry that needed repair. I had been ripped off before- I went in and an THRILLED that I did- VERY PROFESSIONAL, HONEST, AND REASONABLE!! Gabe and Elaine helped me! I winded up buying a new necklace, too! I already told my husband to design my 10 year anniversary piece of jewelry with Gabe. THANK YOU!</Review>

<review>THE ABSOLUTE BEST! Happy Jewelers was recommended to me by a close friend and they were phenomenal. From the first interaction, everyone was extremely friendly. Armida and Gabe assisted me with a ring for my fiance and it came out exactly how I imagined it. I had a bit of tight time table that I needed it for, and they made it happen! I will be going back for our wedding bands and anything else I have a need for. Happy Jewelers is the best, do not waste your time going anywhere else.</review></record>

She didn't stop until she found the perfect replacement diamond and setting for my engagement ring. I also had a lost watch replaced and couldn't be happier. I live nearly 2k miles away, and customer service didn't miss a beat. Armida is a gem! She's always willing to help. No matter what! Even after the sale! Although I don't buy a ton of jewelry, thanks to Armida, all future purchases will come from Happy Jewelers. I love my Cartier timepiece and custom diamond ring.</text>< pics>

I discovered Happy Jewelers on Instagram when I felt like I had limited options-- and boy am I happy I found them!!  My husband (then fiance) proposed with a custom engagement ring produced in NY, we live in LA, so I preferred to work with a local jeweler.  We searched high and low.  DTLA's jewelry district felt like a rat race and I felt like most of the jewelry was low quality and Harry Winston carried a few styles that were fine but I couldn't justify the hefty price tag for styles I wasn't in love with (HW was my last resort).  Finally, I stumbled across Happy Jewelers with some skepticism-- I've never heard of them and they were located in the Fullerton, away from all the hustle and bustle, would they have a good selection?  We are so happy we visited them!  The craftsmanship, quality materials, customer service and price is unparalleled.  My husband and I have personally interacted with Gabe and Danny and it's always been pleasant.  We've purchased both our wedding bands and a few gifts from their location.  Highly recommend!</review>

First off Lovella is wonderful!!! Please see her for all of your custom jewelry needs! My husband took me as a Christmas gift to have a wedding band custom made to match my custom engagement ring. She made the process smooth and had my ring ready even earlier than expected. She was easy to reach and so patient always answering all of my many questions. The wine bottle is a major plus with every purchase. The experience was so great I ended up ordering a wedding band for my husband and Lovella helped me surprise him the day we picked up my wedding band!! Best experience jewelry shopping. My husband and I will be making them our go to jeweler for all of our future purchases.< /Review>

Happy jewelry designed mine and my fiancé’s wedding ring and my wedding band. We have also purchased quite a few other items, such as earrings and 6 heart bracelets. We absolutely love the quality and the excellent customer service. Danny, Gabe and their team treat us like family and we couldn’t be happier with their jewelry!< /review>

<Review>I love this little gem nestled in Fullerton. We actually live in Vegas but have made a trip out to So. Cal to purchase a ring and set my diamonds on two different occasions. My husband and I have met the owners, Danny and Gabe. Every one there is super friendly and they have amazing prices for their jewelry. Their pieces have so much brilliance and are well made. They also have the best customer service as a jeweler and are willing to work with you to create your dream piece. Thanks again, Happy Jewelers.<//Review>< userid>

I have purchased several items for my wife, kids and myself from HJ. Danny and Gabe want you to become life long customers. There's something for everyone at HJ and you are treated top notch regardless if you are spending $100 dollars or 10's of thousands of dollars.</Review>< gmap_id>

<review>The crew at Happy Jewelers took a lot of time to help me find the perfect diamond.  They had an awesome inventory that eventually got me to the ring I purchased. My now fiancée could not have been any happier with it.  It was perfect, and very reasonable price wise.< /review>< pictures>

I was referred by my friend, steve to these guys.  I was looking for Rolex watch that was impossible to get.  Check 4 other places and no one had this but happy jewelers hooked it up.  Loving my new watch, the transaction was on point and very professional.  The price was also on point.  I will be definitely buying more watches from these guys! Highly recommend.< /text>

We were referred to Happy Jewelers by some good friends. It was a great experience through the whole process. Awesome customer service and took care of us. Super patient with us.

Very helpful and friendly staff; always willing to accommodate your needs and your budget.

Danny is such an awesome person to work with! He helped me upgrade my wife’s wedding ring set and gave us a very reasonable price. He was very honest and gave very valuable opinions. We bought another ring from them from one of their Christmas specials and the ring is beautiful. Their staff is very helpful and able to answer any questions you have about jewelry.<//Text>

< Review>
I had the best experience buying my engagement ring here.

I talked to a lot of other jewelers prior to coming here. Every person I talked to about rings immediately tried to sell me right away. That didn’t happen with Happy Jewelers. I never once felt like I was being sold. It was more about  wanting to get me something I would be extremely happy with.

I wasn’t sure what direction to go with the ring so I asked them for help. All I did was show them images of rings I was looking for, answered some simple questions, and they made the most amazing piece of jewelry I’ve ever bought.

Highly recommend.<//Review>

Korrin at Happy Jewelers is the absolute best! She is incredibly professional & takes excellent care of her clients. Whether I’m looking for a small inexpensive gift or a super high end piece she has it covered. I also appreciate that she ships my pieces out promptly & keeps me updated every step of the way, as I don’t live in California. Korrin is an absolute gem, or better yet a diamond!</Text>

Happy Jewelers was the best decision I made when I was choosing an engagement ring. I was assisted by Armida and she was exceptional! Armida was helpful and knowledgeable. She made the whole experience hassle free and easy. I never felt pressured or rushed. All of their staff is very nice. You are always greeted and attended to. You will always feel like family when you come here! I definitely will continue to come here and recommend all to come here as well. Thank you Happy Jewelers!< /text>

My experience at Happy Jewelers in Fullerton was amazing. I came in on my lunch to look around for earrings as a gift. Stopped at a few other shops near by before and the customer service was not the best I was shown earrings at the highest price even when I mentioned my budget. When I got to happy jewelers Hayley helped me. She asked for my price range showed me a few earring. She gave me a great price on the ones I was interested in. I mentioned I was on my lunch and that I was just down the street and she offered to put them on hold for me. She told me they will be on hold and it's okay if I decide to not come back today. After work I came back and she didn't have to ask me my name and grabbed them for me and showed me one more pair before I made my decision. The customer service by far was the best I received this Christmas year as in shopping for the perfect gift for my mother. I received extra gifts and they even steamed my own rings for me! Thank you so much Happy Jewelers! I will definitely return in the future and recommend anyone interested in jewelry or gifts.</review>

We have been customers for many years and will never shop anywhere else. In addition to their vast knowledge, their selection, and the excellent customer service they cannot be outdone.  The time they spend helping you make the perfect selection is amazing. They listen to what you want and will design it for you. I highly recommend you try them ....you will immediately become a lifetime customer.<//review>

<text>Happy Jewelers was awesome to deal with. Gabe, Danny, Sophia and others were very professional, helpful and had great ideas. They gave excellent advice that was in my interest, not theirs. They helped to design then create several custom peices for my wife and my daughter. I am thoroughly pleased. It is no wonder that on a weekend, their counters are very busy while others nearby are not. For me they are worth the drive, with many other jewelers closer to me. Great job guys! A+

Happy Jewelers is amazing! They were so helpful when me and my fiancé went in to buy our engagement ring. They gave us great advice and the price won’t get beat. I can’t thank them enough, and would recommend them to everyone!</text>

I found them on Instagram and reached out for a custom engagement ring. They made the process so simple and seamless. The ring came out gorgeous. I would 100% recommend Happy Jewelers!<//Text>

In a city full of high end luxury and standard, Happy Jewlers is the top echelon of quality and customer service. My family has been going to them for over 15 years and the area nothing we’ve bought there that doesn’t catch compliments and attention from everyone who sees their jewlery.<//review>

Had a custom engagement ring and matching wedding band made. The process was so easy and their prices are so competitive, I ordered from them without hesitation. Gabe was able to select a diamond for me that fit my cut, and was beautiful even though the certificate graded it lower. The ring took about 4 weeks and came out beautiful. Will definitely buy from them again.< /text>

Happy jewelers is a true 5 star experience.  I had the pleasure to meet the staff & purchase a beautiful engagement ring for my fiancé.    The experience was first class by all accounts.   This jeweler made the purchase so seamless & enjoyable.   They took the time to understand and find the exact ring I was looking to design & purchase.  I was thoroughly impressed traveling to Los Angeles & going through the process of finding the perfect diamond & design as I walked through their factory & shop.   Moreover, the owner Gabe & the General Manager, Armida, hosted me themselves which was so personal they made you feel like family.  I will honestly say , I have purchased many pieces of jewelry over the years, but now will only purchase from Happy Jewelers.  These guys are the best of the best & Armida is a true professional!< /Review>

Amazing customer service!  Everyone is friendly and their ability to help guide you through a selection was incredible.  Custom made rings were completed from start to finish in less than 3 weeks and they actually exceeding our expectations.   And if that was not enough, their prices simply can’t be beat.<//review>

These guys are incredible. I’ve had nothing but great results from them. They know their business well. They’re able to understand what it is I need and produce high quality work based off of my inarticulate explanations! They have a lot of options to choose from but in my case, it’s always been custom work. They do exceptional custom work, can pretty much produce whatever it is you’re imagining. They’re easy to talk to, and break down the terminology so you can understand. Definitely going to continue to use them for all my jewelry needs. Thanks guys!!!</review>

Nicole was very helpful and excellent. I also had the pleasure of meeting Gabe and Danny. All of the staff at Happy Jewelers are exceptional! The whole process from placing the custom order to pick up was super smooth and easy.  I communicated directly with Nicole every step of the way via phone. She was excellent at responding to all of my questions and concerns. Gabe is also so patient and thorough. I'm so pleased with my purchase and will definitely be returning for more! Thank you Gabe, Nicole and Danny for all of your help! I am so glad that I found an honest jeweler I can trust!<//text>< pictures>

They made the whole engagement ring process so easy for my fiancé. Korrin was amazing with helping him design my ring. They were all so helpful and so awesome! My fiancé and I went back to have my ring sized and they were seriously all the NICEST people ever! Would 100% recommend to anyone and everyone. We will be back there for our wedding bands and any other jewelry needs we have.< /Review>

<text>Happy Jewelers is truly phenomenal! We visited Happy Jewelers after we received a referral. Nicole was amazing and answered all of my questions. Every ring is a custom piece and I was so thankful to have Nicole provide her input and pull different stones, settings and bands to put together a gorgeous piece! I cannot thank this team enough for the great experience and an absolutely stunning upgrade. Thank you Gabe, Nicole and Danny for the exceptional experience from start to finish. I am so HAPPY with my custom rings!<//text>< pics>

<Text>I was recommended Happy Jewelers by a friend and after looking at a few other jewelers in the area I finally went in. Should have started with Happy Jewelers because it was hands down the best experience I had over all others. Staff is friendly and knew exactly what I was looking for. They have a ton of quality diamonds and are willing to show you them all if that’s what it takes to find the perfect one. Thank you again to Danny for helping me find the perfect engagement ring!<//Text></record></dataset><record>

<text>I went into Happy Jewelers to find a great gift for my wife. This was our first Christmas being married, so I wanted something special. I explained what I was looking for to Danny, and he gave me a few ideas. He showed me a set of Beautiful diamond earrings that had really great quality diamonds that really Sparkled. Right away I knew I wanted those earring for my wife. I had a budget that I needed to stay within, and Danny helped make that possible. Happy Jewelers always takes great care of us, and their jewelry is always to quality!!! Thank You Happy Jewelers!!< /text>< pictures>

AMAZING CUSTOMER SERVICE! They go above and beyond! I came in to pick out my wedding band and not only did they fix my engagement ring, clean, and polish it. But they also gave me a loaner band in the mean time while I was waiting for my new rings. I will gladly refer all friends and family here! Can’t wait to come back for more!< /text>

I have bought all kinds of jewelry from Happy Jewelers.  Some custom and some directly from their store.  Everything they do is high quality and Gabe and the team are high class.  Over the years, they have always made me feel like I’m a valued customer.   I wouldn’t go anywhere else.< /review>

Elaine was very helpful, I called her and she knew exactly what I wanted.  She sent me pictures and videos of the ring and explained all the details regarding the color, clarity and cut.  When I walked into the store I was amazed how big it was and how much selection they had! I was very impressed and grateful for their knowledge.  I will definitely be back again! Thank you again for all of your help Elaine and Happy Jewelers!</Text>

We Love love love Danny and his team at Happy Jewelers!  My now fiancé and I custom built my engagement ring along with this talented team.  Then 6 months later because I love change they helped me redesign my ring again!   They are all so friendly and helpful.  We’ve actually invited most of them to our destination wedding already.   Go see them! All our friends and family go here!</review>

Shana was great and helped me pick out a white gold cross and chain. They work with your budget, care about their customers, and are the best in the business. I will definitely continue to come here for all of my jewelry needs and will continue to recommend them to my friends and family... Thank you Happy Team you guys are the best!</Text>< Response>

<text>Happy Jewelers is the only jewelry shop we will give our business to. They are absolutely amazing! They are a family owned and operated business and it shows. They are warm, friendly and once you shop once, you feel like family as well. Their selection is BEYOND fabulous. I challenge anyone to go there and not find something absolutely beautiful. Jewelry is a very personal and tricky purchase. It's an investment financially and often romantically (lol). So if you want to be treated like royalty, shop with Happy Jewelers. You will not regret it.<//text><time>1533006636265< /time>< resp>

Happy Jewelers helped me re-size my engagement ring/wedding band and my husband’s wedding band! They were super helpful/knowledgeable and took a lot of time with us. They also allowed me to come back in to make a minor change to the ring sizing for FREE! Elaine was so kind and sweet and stayed with me the whole time to make sure the fit was exactly what I wanted! I highly recommend them!<//text>

I have referred a number of friends and co-workers to Gabe and Danny. The prices are great and the jewelry is of the finest quality. Gabe has designed different rings for my sister and I and we are always getting complements on them. Buying jewelry really gets down to who you trust, especially when it comes to pieces handed down from generation to generation and our family has trust that we are always getting a quality product at a fair price.</Review>< resp>

Happy Jewelers was very helpful and informative. I went to different jewelers but nothing compared to the customer service of Happy Jewelers! Once I picked up my ring, it exceeded my expectations. The ring was so beautiful and stunning, also they gave me a great deal! Nicole was the one that helped me and she was excellent and made the whole process easy. I would recommend this shop for anybody looking to get engaged :)<//text>

Came in with a budget, told them a lower figure, they found me something for an even lower price. Got it appraised by a different jeweler for about the price I paid so I know they didn’t rip me off either. Good prices, honest people, they won’t urge you to break the bank. Makes sense why they remain so popular.<//review>

<Text>Let me just start by saying 5 stars is not enough for the Happy Jewelers team. They have the most wonderful, helpful, knowledgeable and caring people working there and you can't beat the quality they offer. They go out of their way to ensure their customers get the very best jewelery for their price range. I have recommended Happy Jewelers to many people and will continue to do so. They have a lifelong customer in me, and quite a few people I know. The entire Happy Jewelers team is a true class act! Keep up the phenomenal work!<//Text>< Name>

Both Gabe, Danny, and staff are the most genuine and caring jewelers there ever are. They are less salesmen / salespeople and more jewelry artisans that truly care more for their customers investments than just making a buck. I have been with these guys for almost the last 20 years and recommend them to my entire family wholeheartedly. Our daughters come from out of state when looking to purchase jewelry and exclusively go to Happy Jewelry. They are very knowledgeable and honest about their inventory, and can get almost anything you can think of. And when they can't they'll refer you to any of their resources without hesitation. Honestly who does that? THEY DO...... Another perk I've been enjoying lately is that they do exclusive custom jewelry pieces, of which have become very valuable heirlooms for me and my family. Gabe and Danny treat everyone of their customers as family regardless of the size of your purchase. I've seen this over and over. I work hard for my money and don't take spending lightly. Best investment I can recommend to anyone. Don't believe me? Go check them out for yourself, let the size of the crowd tell you the truth. Some 10-15 vendors @ their venue and they have most of the customers and staff to handle everyone's desire. Love you "Happy Jewelers" signed Happier customer. Lots of love and respect for all your hard work and dedication to what your doing.<//Text>

<text>Went into buy an engagement ring on the recommendation of a buddy. Never bought serious jewelry before let alone been in a jewelry store so I was a bit nervous. To prepare for this purchase, I watched countless YouTube videos and read tons of articles all stating the best tips and tricks to buying engagement rings and diamonds. But to be honest,  nothing prepares you for this kinda thing except experience, which I had none.  Luckily the guys and gals at Happy Jewelers treated me like an old friend and took care of me. They helped me pick out the perfect diamond on the perfect setting, at a great price. I will Desiree be recommending them to anyone I know<//text><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None</Response><gmapID>0x80dcd601d0029277:0xffb037f7b55943c</gmapID></record>

<Review>Happy Jewelers is truly the #1 place to find the most beautiful and up-to-date jewelry. They always have the best selection, quality and prices around.

<date>1551389439959</date><rating>5< /rating><Text>I came here to purchase an engagement ring. I was made to feel very welcomed, was offered useful advice, and I feel that I was offered a more than reasonable price for my purchase.  As I was leaving, the owner came out to the parking lot to shake my hand and thank me for my business.  Considering that what I spent was probably nothing compared to what most people spend there, it was super cool of him to come out and say thanks in person.

A couple weeks ago, one of the stones chipped. We took it in, and they fixed the problem within a week, at no charge to me. I would highly recommend this place to anybody looking for rings, earrings, watches or other assorted fashion accessories.<//Text><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

< Review>
As soon as you walk into the Jewelry Mart the first thing you think to yourself is, "Happy Jewelers has more customers at their shop, than the entire store." This is a fact and says a lot about these guys. The first time I heard of this shop is from my friend Trina and my boss Walt, who both buy their jewelry here. They had nothing, but good things to say about the brothers who own the shop (Gabe and Danny) and made comments about them like, "they are the nicest people," and "they are salt of the Earth." Both of these comments proved to be true. I first met them about 1 month and half ago, when Trina took me there to go shopping for my girlfriends (now fiancés) engagement ring. I knew exactly what I wanted and Gabe treated me like an old friend and gave me a very good price on both the engagement ring and the wedding band (I feel like I got the wedding band for free, the price was so good.) All they needed to do was size it and it was mine. That same night I was having some problems and concerns and I was able to call Gabe at 12am at night and he answered the phone and took care of me and made sure that I was getting what I wanted. He understood the anxiety I was having before proposing and just made sure that I would be taken care of in time for my engagment. Gabe kept his word since I have met him and we continue to grow our relationship. I will be buying all my jewelry here for the rest of my life, no matter where I live, cause I'm sure they would mail it to me, so if your not local, don't worry about it. Just call and talk to Gabe and he will help you out. I have so much more to say, but it is getting late and I need to go to bed. BEFORE YOU BUY ANY JEWELRY ANYWHERE ELSE CHECK OUT HAPPY JEWELERS AND THEY WILL BEAT YOUR PRICE. I CAN SAY THIS WITH CONFIDENCE. WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO LOSE.????< /Review>

<review>Danny and Gabe are hands down the best in the US, I had previously delt mostly with places from NYC as they were the only ones capable of both completing custom work I wanted and maintaining a constantly updating inventory.  These guys get the best in high end watches, jewelry, and amazing diamonds.  Unbeatable customer service, and all right here in Orange County, I’ll never go anywhere else again!< /review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

This company really cares for their customers and takes pride in the jewelry they have. They are hands down the #1 jeweler I’ve ever experienced and they’ve just gained a lifetime customer. Special thanks to Armida, she did a phenomenal job making sure everything I needed was done perfectly and in a timely manner. Highly recommend to everyone!< /review>

I have nothing but good things to say about Happy Jewelers! They made the engagement ring of my fiancé dreams. Gabe, one of the owners, and Sophia worked with us to make sure it was exactly what we wanted. Not to mention, they were the most affordable out of all the Jewelers we shopped around at. You really get your bang for your buck. The whole staff is very friendly and helpful. I would recommend them to anybody! Thank you Gabe and Sophia!! We are customers for life.<//Review>

<Review>Gabe and his team are the best in the business! My whole family has gone to him for years and we won’t go anywhere else. Even though we now live in a different state he is so easy to work with. Their knowledge and non-pushy sales environment are what keeps us coming back. They can make anything custom but also have a large selection of unique pieces to choose from. I get compliments on my jewelry all the time!<//Review>< pictures>

Looking for the perfect engagement ring can be a nightmare. After numerous unpleasant visits to different jewelers, I visited Happy Jewelers and I'm so glad I did. Shana and the Happy Jewelers team was committed in finding me the perfect ring while still working within my budget. Shana worked with great enthusiasm and patience throughout the whole process and we ended up customizing a ring that my fiance absolutely loved. We'll definitely be coming back for the wedding bands. Highly recommend!!!< /text>

We went to Gabe and staff for help.  We have moved to Chicago but our trust and loyalty is always going to stay with Happy Jewelers.
Their customer service is so above and beyond.  We were given so much personal attention because we were working long distance.  Nicole was amazing and patient especially going back and forth with pictures and texting.  In the end, our girl had a beautiful set of diamond stud earrings that she loves.
We’re very grateful to Nicole and Gabe.</review><Response>None< /Response>< UserId.>

I know how hard it is to find a jeweler that not only does top notch work but to find a jeweler you 100% trust and on top of it beats everyone in prices! Happy Jewelers does all of that! Every time you visit Happy Jewelers you always get a great experience and they keep you wanting to come back for more. This family owned business has figured it out! They put their customers first which is why their repeat clients have been coming to them for years. I have recommended so many people to Happy Jewelers and I have never had one complaint.

<review>Amazing!! Gabe helped me build the exact ring my girlfriend, now fiancé, wanted!! She was so excited and amazed at the beauty and quality, while I was amazed at how well Gabe took care of me! It is rare to get this quality of customer service these days, and I can tell you that These guys are the real deal! They answered every question or concern I had very quickly, and followed through with their promises. I suggest giving them a try, you'll never go anywhere else!< /review><userid>110866646041193790467<//userid><username>Daniel Kihle< /username><date>1520228119777< /date><resp>None</resp></record>

<Review>Happy Jewelers is th best place to go for any first timers who are looking to buy an engagement ring. Gabe and his team were awesome and very helpful in the process of picking out the perfect ring for the happiest lady who is my fiancé now.😊 I had no clue what to look for since it was a surprise for her, but It was a fun and entertaining experience in picking the right ring with much thanks to Gabe and the team. I did not feel any pressure at all, and I will recommend Happy Jewelers to anyone who is looking to cherish a great moment with their love ones that will be remembered forever. Thank you Happy Jewelers!!!< /Review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

Shana’s personalized level of customer service is unmatched by anyone in the jewelry industry. She goes out of her way to make sure that you are happy and amazed by the end product. Amazed is probably the wrong word. Breath-taken is more like it.

In this case, the end product was a gorgeous rose gold morganite ring with a split shank and round brilliant cut diamonds on the halo and band. Shana made sure I got a great deal and that I was satisfied.

I am confident to say I have found my jeweler for life. Thank you Shana and thank you Happy Jewels!< /Review>

I sent Gabe and his team a design I found on the internet and in just a couple of weeks they custom made my fiance's engagement ring. She loves the ring and was thrilled at the quality and attention to detail. Hayley was great to work with too, sending me pictures and videos of different diamonds and walking me through the process. I could not be more impressed by the level of customer service I received from Happy Jewelers. I can definitely recommend these guys!</Review>

The only place I will ever buy jewelry! Great customer service and professionalism. Hayley Baray is an excellent jeweler. She is very knowledgeable and goes above and beyond to help you get exactly what you want! Even after my purchase she helped to make sure I was comfortable with the size and style of necklace.< /Text>

<text>Had a great experience. I shopped around for price and they were very competitive with everywhere I looked. Not having bought any jewelry before I had no idea what to even look for. Hayley helped answer any question I had and kindly guided me through all of the choices. Being new I wanted to see everything and all of the employees were very patient and helpful. I never felt pushed or rushed at all.</text><user>118397731138055666351<//user><Rating>5</Rating></record>

Only one criticism, we are still waiting for the written appraisal of the women’s Rolex watch we purchased. I Purchased a beautiful gold Rolex watch  with diamines and my fiancé and I purchased our wedding rings and all of the purchases were seamless and easy.  I dealt with Korrin and Gabe and they were both professional, efficient and true to their word. Thank you all. But please send us the appraisal for insurance purposes.< /Review>

Excellent service! I could not be happier with my experience here and the quality of the ring and stone I purchased!  Happy jewlers know their stuff and will not try to hangle you into an impulse decision.  It was a wonderful shopping experience, I will definitely be coming back in the future!</text>

My husband has been using Happy Jewelers for over 10 years and they continue to be our go-to jeweler. The service, quality, and professionalism is unbeatable. Gabe and Armida are amazing to work with. The majority of jewelry we have purchased has been custom orders and we couldn't be happier with the results. We have recommended them to a number of friends and family because we trust the quality. Thanks Happy Jewelers for all of the beautiful pieces that we love so much!!< /text>

The staff was so helpful and friendly! I went to Hayley and she helped me find a necklace that was the perfect style, length, and price! She had an eye for design and a real attention to detail that helped make the process of picking out a piece of jewelry for the first time, easy and exciting. My girlfriend was in love with the necklace and I couldn't have had a better experience anywhere else!! Thank you Hayley and the rest of the Happy Jewlers team!!< /text>

< Review>
I've been shopping with Gabe and his team for over 5 years. I found him when he was able to locate a vintage watch I was trying to purchase for my husband. Since then, I've purchased countless pieces with him, including a reset of my engagement ring. Not only am I constantly stopped by people swooning over his beautiful pieces, but he is also a true pleasure to work with. His attention to detail is simply unparalleled, and he always finds a way to envision and create my designs, even when I'm unable to properly articulate them! His entire team is genuinely kind and incredibly knowledgeable. I always enjoy seeing Gabe and his team, and look forward to shopping with them for many years to come! A sincere thank you from our family to yours.< /Review>

<review>Great experience every time. We ONLY go to Happy Jewelers for exceptional jewelry. I have sent friends and families to them and they were all taken care of and have become loyal customers to Happy Jewelers because of their great inventory and staff. Today is no exception; Danny, Armida, and Shayna were so awesome we were in and out of there in less than 30 minutes with awesome gifts for my wife's birthday and my daughter who is with me. Everyone should come and experience they're great customer service and by great gift items from this place.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics><Gmap_id>0x80dcd601d0029277:0xffb037f7b55943c</Gmap_id>< user>

If you are looking for an engagement ring, birthday gift, or something just because, I highly recommend shopping here and avoiding the mall crowds or overzealous salespeople at the brand stores.< /text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

<Pictures>None</Pictures><Review>Just wanted to thank you for such a great experience! I went in a year ago to find an engagement ring and Elaine was so much help, she took her time with pairing different stackable pieces. Since then, I have purchased a few pieces and continue to tell friends and family about you guys. You guys have gone above and beyond and will always be my go to jewelers!</Review>< Response>

<text>My fiance bought my engagement ring from Gabe. After the matter of the exciting event I asked him about the experience. He couldn't stop mentioning how knowledgeable and welcoming Gabe and the staff were. He went to a few places but he knew he had to return with Gabe because he was just so helpful. My ring is absolutely beautiful. I constantly receive compliments on the quality and look of the ring. Its gorgeous. When I went in to get it resized the staff was beyond nice and helpful. I got my ring back looking shinier and more beautiful. Overall if you're searching for a jeweler with an abundant amount of knowledge and trust, Happy Jewelry is the place to visit. Everyone is so great and they really work with you so you're happy with product. From here on out this will be our place!< /text>< pics>

First time buyer but couldn’t be more happier. Bought a stud through Instagram and even though I live east coast the delivery came literally next morning of the purchase. And the item is beautiful as well. Will definitely be doing more purchases here for sure.</review>

Most importantly she made me feel comfortable. Never pressured me as she showed me about a million different rings I said no to. Her patience and availability at all times of the day, during the week, as well as weekends, is much appreciated.  I’d recommend Shana to anyone looking for the perfect ring for the perfect someone.

<text>Happy Jewelers has always given us an A+ experience! The team is truly there for their clients. To meet our needs and to give us the feeling of making our dreams come alive!
Marko and myself have been, time and time again, genuinely impressed with how kind and communicative everyone is.
Always welcoming new folks that approach their vendor table. They ask questions and keep us smiling! A lot!
Also, they give hugs! I love it! I’m a hugger, and so the feeling of connecting that way made our purchase more friendly intimate. The women and men (owners) there are divine! Super knowledgeable in their element. Thank you Gabe and Danny!
I would recommend Happy Jewelers to everyone seeking a beautiful, sentimental piece of jewelry!
My engagement ring, and our wedding bands are absolutely gorgeous!
It was a memorable and exciting buy for us, and I wouldn’t have asked for better service. They are so wonderful!

<text>I went to Happy Jewelers today so that I could get my necklace repaired. I had just gotten off work, and almost didn’t stop by because I was worried I’d have to wait awhile. However, as soon as I approached the counter, I was greeted by Elaine who helped me immediately. I didn’t spend more than 5 minutes waiting! My necklace holds a very high sentimental value to me, and I was worried about the quality of the repair work so I took to Yelp to read few reviews and this place stood out to me. Many of their customers have been with them for years, so I felt comfortable going to Happy Jewelers since they have such a great reputation and rating. The work that was done on my necklace is fantastic and I could not be happier with it. The quality of the repair, paired with the incredible service and treatment I received will definitely keep me going back to Happy Jewelers.</text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

Last year a good friend and her son recommended Happy Jewelers when they heard that my son was wanting to get engaged! My son dragged me along and we were immediately impressed from the greeting we received! Gabe and Daniel and their staff treated us like we were family from the moment we introduced ourselves! My son picked out a beautiful engagement ring and I walked out with a beautiful retirement gift to myself - a Rolex watch!
Went there this past weekend with my son and future daughter in law to pick out wedding bands. Gabe and Daniel immediately remembered us and we were shown some beautiful wedding bands! The kids got what they wanted from the awesome selection they have! Yes - I walked out with a beautiful Cartier Roadster Watch !! Happy Jewelers is the only place I will go for jewelry from now on!< /review>

<Rating>5</Rating><Review>I am so picky when it come to real quality & value for the jewelry I buy. I usually drive to downtown LA, fight the horrible traffic and the huge amour of people to get the value & quality that I desire. Now, I have found Happy Jewelers and I could not be happier. Their customer service was beyond my expectations as well as the incredible job making the new setting for my wedding ring for my 20th Anniversary. I never imagined I could have such a beautiful new ring!! Thank you Danny & Gabe for going out of your way to make me much a happy customer. I will NEVER have to go anywhere else again!< /Review>< pictures>

Gabe is beyond phenomenal both in person and with his products. He truly takes his time in talilor fitting and customizing a spectrum of jewelry to your own taste and style. I bought my wife’s engagement ring , crosses, braclets and other items and the quality was amazing. I referred him over to 6 people so far from family to friends and even clients who truly would appreciate his products, taste and class A customer service. You would also see my testimony when you visit his store and you would see that he is the only one that is extremely busy amongst all the other shops beside him.

Thank you Gabe for all your help.</text>

<Text>I started buying my jewelry 10 years ago from Happy Jewelers and I'm so happy with all of my pieces. Armida has been such a rockstar! She helps me pick out such beautiful pieces and always finds a way to stay within my budget. Also, I love that this is a family owned store. Danny and Gabe make me feel so comfortable and special. I can't wait to buy more goodies! Thank you Happy Jewelers for being the best jewelers around!<//Text><pics>None</pics>< Response>

I recently bought an engagement ring from Happy Jewelers and they made the whole process of buying and receiving the ring a great experience. I went in there knowing very little about rings and what my fiancée wanted but with their help I was able to design the perfect ring.  They worked with in my budget and showed me so many great diamonds. They made sure to find me the perfect diamond and made the ring very fast. They made the engagement process so fun and exciting and eliminated all my early worries of buying a ring. I wouldn't buy jewelry anywhere else. My fiancée gets so many compliments on all the jewelry I buy from Happy Jewelers and they always have the best quality products. I can now rely on them to make holidays, anniversary, & birthdays so easy for me. Thank you Happy Jewelers for all the amazing jewelry. You guys never disappoint.</Review>

Best experience ever! My mom left me her emerald ring, which wasn't my style and I came in to Happy Jewelers and Gabe worked with me and designed the most amazing rose gold setting for the emerald ring, that I now wear everyday. I can't thank him enough.< /review>

Buying jewelry from happy jewelers is a great experience. I purchased a necklace for a friend from Hayley Geer. It was one of my first time buying jelwery and she made the experience comfortable and easy. She was very friendly and worked with me to find the very best deal that I could possibly afford with my budget. She even spent time answering my questions via text when she was off of work. I would highly recommend!!</Text>

This is without a doubt the best jewelry buying experience you can have. Gabe, the entire Arik Family, and all of their associates are extremely professional. If there is a piece you are seeking and they do not have it in stock, they will literally custom make it for you to your specifications in their factory. Not to mention their prices are unbeatable. Please, for your own good, make Happy Jewlers your first stop when purchasing a new piece of jewelry... you'll be happy you did.<//Review>

My fiancé brought my engagement ring through Gabe. He told Gabe exactly what I wanted and he did it! I am in love with it! I had to get it resized, which wasn’t a problem. I live in NY, he sent me the label for overnight shipping and altered the ring for no cost.  It was such an easy process. We recently reached out to him for my wedding band. He took the time to listen to what I want and matched my engagement ring. My set is AMAZING!! I’m marrying my best friend in 5 days and I can’t wait to wear it for the rest of my life. The staff is also super friendly and helpful. Korrin sent me a video of my set when it was ready and answered any questions I had. Happy Jewelers are the best and we will continue to go back for any jewelry in the future!< /review>

They made me feel very welcome and comfortable Since I’m not well versed in purchasing jewelry and very intimidated with the whole process. Shana is by far the epitome of great customer service and immeasurably friendly and curtious. I will absolutely be shopping for jewelry from now on through Happy Jewlery thanks to Shana.

Love this store and it's employees! I went here to get my grandmothers rings remade and they couldn't have turned out more beautiful. Armida was SO helpful every step of the way and always had great design suggestions! Since my engagement ring we've gotten my husbands rings made, and I had my a beautiful college ring remade for my mom! Needless to say this will be our forever jewelers! Thanks happy jewelers!

We've been going to Happy Jeweler's for almost ten years. I've had so many wonderful expierences with Gabe. We have also referred so many friends and family. We always hear great feed back from everyone. Gabe does such a great job at constantly having new and trendy pieces at affordable prices. My favorite is watching his Instagram LIVE to see the next new pieces that have arrived at the store.  I often let Gabe know of my favorite pieces and he takes care of the rest. Meaning getting in touch with my husband. Can't wait for the next time I get to come in and shop! Thanks Happy Jewelers for being the best!</Review>

<Text>My sister is a frequent flyer at HJ. Elaine greeted me right when I walked up, and asked if I wanted to see anything. I was looking at some rose gold studs for my sister's wedding. I was wanted something I could wear day to day, but was appropriate for the wedding as well. I didn't think I was going to walk out with a pair of STUNNING diamond earrings but I did, and I love them! Thanks for the awesome service Happy Jewlers & Elaine!</Text><Date>1499034038623</Date>< Pics>

Happy Jewelers was amazing. When my fiancé was ring shopping a coworker of his recommended them and I’m so glad he did! I’m in love with our rings and the service they provided made the whole wedding planning easier. My engagement ring needed to be resized and they resized it within the hour. Each time we visit, they take my ring to be cleaned while we look for jewelry. Our wedding bands were custom made and they were everything they hoped for them to be. Happy Jewelers will be our only stop for any jewelry needs!<//review>

<review>Happy Jewelers is the only place I shop! Anytime I'm in the neighborhood, I stop in to have my rings cleaned. I was there recently and a couple of rings caught my eye. Armida was so patient while I decided between the three rings. She even went through the differences and the similarities of each piece. She and the rest of the staff are so knowledgeable and friendly.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< GmapID>

I cannot thank Happy Jewelers enough for all of their help with our jewelry purchases. Armida and Gabe are true professionals and most importantly, they know what makes my wife happy when it comes to jewelry!

I did my homework when purchasing my wife's engagement ring and Happy Jewelers really blew the competition out of the water. It was even worth it to take a flight down from SF to LA for the day to make the purchase. Armida was incredible, providing updates and photos throughout the entire process.

I will continue to purchase any and all jewelry through Happy Jewelers and recommend them to friends and family!< /Review>

<text>“It’s easy to find the perfect ring, the difficult part is finding the perfect jeweler.”

Throughout my three month proposal planning adventure, the part I worried about the most became the easiest when I introduced myself to Danny. Our conversation started with talking about my fiancé and how we got to where we are today. He asked me three key questions, budget, size or clarity, and when do you need this by. He brought out 10 different types of diamonds all reasonably within my price point and explained what I need to know about each. He even made me walk outside with the diamonds to see how they shined in the light.  Have no fear if you are an amateur and simply looking to know the proper information. Danny instilled trust, communication and confidence that everything will go right.

Not only did the ring come on time, but it was more perfect than I could imagine. We texted throughout the process and till this day, I cannot believe I didn’t go sooner. I will continue to refer all of My friends and family. There is no question why Happy Jewlers is number one in the OC.<//text>< Pictures>

I originally took my ring elsewhere to get it resized and they quoted me $80 and told me I'd have to leave it there. Happy jewelers was helpful, personable, and had my ring resized in no time. Such a great experience and no complaints!</review>

I was speechless after my visit to this store. All the ratings and reviews are true. They really are the best jewelry store in Los angels.. they were so nice, helpful, fast, trustworthy. I cannot hype this store enough. They have an insane inventory and if you're  a clinical  indecisive person like me, they did what I EXACLTLY wanted in no time.</Text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><review>Happy Jewelers is THE BEST place to get your jewlery! I have been to many places for jewlery and NO ONE will take care of you like Happy Jewelers. I can’t rave about my experience enough! From the minute I started the process they were so attentive every step of the way. You can really see they truly care about you and your wants and needs. They will do anything to make sure you are fully happy with your jewlery! Korrin was the gal that took care of me during it all and wow she was the best! I must have had 100 questions and she was always so sweet. I would text her literally any time of day/night and she made sure to answer all questions I had! She made the whole process amazing and I will send all my friends to her! So thankful we found a family jeweler we can pass down generations.</review>< pictures>

I've been always skeptical about ordering online especially such a expensive item such as this but it went smoothly and it was the same watch as the picture I was very very satisfied . Danny made me feel at ease and answered his phone when I called if not he would call me back it's been a pleasure doing business with you. Aloha<//text>

I came across Happy Jewelers on Instagram and loved their live videos. I was stun how many customize beautiful ring setting they do. My fiancé (now) and I decide to visit Happy Jewelers to get a customize setting along with finding that beautiful diamond to fit with it. Danny was wonderful!! He explained everything we needed to know about the 4c’s and narrowed down our thoughts on which C’s is more important, that way we can help cut back on some cost. He also took told us that he can customize the ring setting, and if we don’t like it we don’t need to buy it. Along with that he was very good on always getting back to us through text messages on questions we had . He truly made us felt really comfortable like a friend and not just his customer. I can’t wait to go back and pick out the wedding band and future jewelry’s from here!:)

<Review>The whole experience was amazing and easy as can be. My fiancé (then gf) would send me dm’s from their instagram of rings she liked, which turned out to be extremely helpful. When it came time to make the purchase I filled out an inquiry and was contacted the next day by Armida. I was on a strict timeline as us guys tend to do everything last minute. She was amazing throughout the process as I really had no idea about anything diamond/ring related. Within a few hours she sent me different pictures of rings, diamonds and costs. I paid over the phone and 8 days later they mailed it to my office. I never had to step foot into a store and my fiancé has not stopped smiling. Recommend happy jewelers to anyone/everyone!< /Review></record>

<review>I just picked up my ring about a month ago and I still can't get over how gorgeous it is.  I worked with Shana and she assured me that I could find exactly what I wanted in store. I found a ring I liked but wanted to modify it without the halo on my pear shaped morganite. She said it was no problem and Gabe gave me a price immediately. I went home and couldn't stop thinking about it and came right back and ordered the ring. It was ready 3 weeks later just like she said. When I got the ring it was a little big and they resized it right there on the spot. My friend came with me and Shana wrote down exactly what she wanted and the price on a card so she could come back to her. I can't wait to get some stacker bands. I'm coming right back to Shana. I've gotten so many compliments and I send them immediately to their IG so they can see their rings.</review>< Rating>

I moved to California five (5) years ago.  I have a family Jewler in my home state and I needed to find an eternity band for my wife (at the time fiancé).

I could not find anyone, including my family jewler back home, who could help me in the time I needed, with my particularly challenging requirements, or for what I considered a fair price (I know my diamonds for a lay person).

I was recommended to Happy Jewlers by a colleague and couldn’t have been happier. Not only did Happy Jewlers come through for me in a way I never thought a Jewler would, they have continued to take care of me, my wife, my sister, and mother-in-law as well.

Since the original wedding band years ago, we have gone through 2 upgrades, diamond studs, a new wedding band for me, a second pair of diamond earrings, a diamond tennis bracelet, a second gold bracelet with a diamond disk, matching necklace, a new wedding band for my mother-in-law, a beautiful engagement ring for my sister, and more.

I honestly could not speak more highly of the quality, customer service, professionalism, or all around experience I get with Happy Jewlers.  Whether you’re local or across the country, Happy is there for you.

I’m not sure who should be more grateful for the referral years ago, me or Happy Jewlers. We’re hooked!!!<//text>

He worked with the jeweler to design me a custom ring. He proposed to me in the dark, and when he got down on one knee and opened the box, it lit up the ring and sparkled. Every detail that my finance and jewler took to make that evening memorable and perfect was taken into consideration. I highly recommend using them as your jeweler. We don’t even live in California, and they made it feel like we have known them forever. When it came to customizing my fiancé’s wedding band, I got a call from Nicole, who was incredibly sweet. She was so excited for us, you could hear it in her voice. Felt like I was talking to my best friend who was excited for me to receive a gift in the mail. Happy  Jewelers goes above and beyond. I will recommend you all to everyone I know.

Ps. I still place my ring in the lit up box when I work out. And every time I open it up, it reminds me of the day he proposed. Thank you for still creating wonderful memories.< /text><gmap_id>0x80dcd601d0029277:0xffb037f7b55943c<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Wife broke the back off a pair of sentimental earrings on the morning of  Christmas Eve. Not only did Happy Jewelers fix them that same day but also unexpectedly gifted me a bottle of wine when I picked them up!< /Review>
