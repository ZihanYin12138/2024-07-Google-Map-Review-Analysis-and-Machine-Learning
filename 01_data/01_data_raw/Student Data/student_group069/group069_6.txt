VERY EXPENSIVE for a simple tire change. The price was over $150! Then they send you someone who does not speak English, so you can't understand what they are saying. And then after taking your card information up front before the driver even arrives, the driver tells you you have to pay cash. Umm then why was my personal card information required over the phone and why wouldn't someone tell me I needed to pay cash??? Very disorganized and poor communication between dispatch and driver. Unprofessional. I will not be using this service again.< /review>

I contacted the company to have my motorcycle towed from Oakland to San Leandro.   I explained to the dispatcher that the motorcycle had been damaged because I was involved in an accident,  and the front fender is smashed into the front tire and pushing would be difficult.

I was told the driver would meet me in 45 minutes.  After 1 hour I called for an update, the dispatcher advised it would be 20 minutes.  Fast forward to 2.5 hours later,  the driver called and said he was outside.   I walked outside, no tow truck or driver.  I  called him back, he was given the wrong address.

Finally, he arrived with a flatbed tow truck but didn't not have a motorcycle dolly (fender is pushed into the front tire).  A friend at work had to assist with moving the motorcycle (I couldn't because I was injured from the accident).

The Road King is finally secured and ready to go.     We arrived at the location and needed assistance from a stranger to down load and push the motorcycle.

The driver was apologetic and professional,  but the overall service sucked.   I want to mention that the truck was not from the company I called and it was out of Union City.  I picked this company because they stated they were located in Oakland.< /Text>

DO NOT CALL THIS TOWING SERVICE. They will rob you.

My car broke down close to my apartment in a PG&E work area requiring me to tow my vehicle prior to 7am the following day. I scheduled a tow truck driver from a different service to tow my car at 6:30am. The tow truck driver ended up arriving 30 minutes late but within that time frame I called Rocket Towing to schedule a tow truck from their service to tow my vehicle as I was worried that the initial tow truck (from a different service) wasn't going to show up.
However, shortly after I scheduled Rocket Towing to come out to my car, the initial tow truck driver messaged me that he was still coming. I called Rocket Towing back, literally 13 minutes from when I first called them (saved a picture of it on my phone), and they told me I needed to pay a $50 cancellation fee.
It had not even been 15 minutes, and they were telling me I needed to pay $50 to cancel which, by the way, they NEVER told me about $50 cancellation fees during the initial phone call to Rocket Towing. Otherwise, I would not have booked it or at the very least, I would have cancelled the other tow truck driver.
On top of that, the tow truck driver who I had initially called, said that towing service actually gives him jobs and that it is common practice among tow truck drivers to not charge if a person calls and cancels in less than 15 minutes from the booking.

THIS PLACE WILL ROB YOU. DO NOT CALL THEM.  Rocket Towing, how can you people live with yourselves taking $50 dollars from someone who needs help, struggling to fix their car, in the middle of a recession??? Shame on you.< /review>

Omg Mario came through! We were on the side of the road where it was pitch black in Orinda where we aren’t at all familiar with the surroundings. He made us feel safe and secure about getting us and the car safely home. This experience sucked but I’m glad a person like him came along to ease the struggle and frustration of having your car not working and being stranded.<//Review>

<review>I blew a tire in Alameda and in the process of replacing with spare, the car fell of the jack onto the pavement. Because the car now rested so low, I could not get the jack underneath to lift it up. Another towing service answered my call and immediately put me on hold without my getting a word in. Juan and Rocket Towing to the rescue. After they quickly took my call and details in a friendly manner, Juan showed up on schedule 45 minutes later. Using several jacks, body contortionist maneuvers and much hard labor, he was able to get the car up off the pavement and change the tire. He did all this, reassuring me that all would be ok, and he kept a smile on his face. I would call these folks again and recommend them without reservation. Thanks Juan!!! And Rocket Towing!<//review></record>

BEWARE, this business does not state this at the time you call to arrange a tow, but there is a $49 cancellation fee which they assess even if you immediately call back and cancel the tow. Customer service team was inept and rude.</Text>

Do not use this tow service rude as can be . They seem to be a monopoly because if you live in oakland area and you Google tow service there phone number pops up like 5 times under different names . Pass on this company</Review>

<Review>Guy and Ori towed my van from El Sobrante to San Leandro. I was impressed how fast they were. I was told from their office that they should arrive in 35-45 minutes and they came within 15 minutes. If a towing experiene can be a nice one, this one was for sure. Thanks.

I ordered a BLT with chicken and they charged $2.99 for extra meat, so the sandwich was $11.23. Well, where is the extra bacon or chicken?< /text>

<review>The service is good. It is near businesses, so its convenient for me if I forgot lunch. It is way overpriced for what you get though. I have had better sandwiches and salads. The restaurant it self is clean but a little crowded.< /review>< UserId.>

<Review>Tasty, fresh sandwiches and generous made-to-order salads are the hallmarks of this lunch spot. Mostly take out with a few tables. Small selection of beer and wine. Friendly staff behind the counter. No wait staff. A bit pricey.<//Review>< rating>

<Review>Straight forward no-nonsense ordering - Sandwich or Salad?

They have a lot of ingredients to pick from to make your own salad. I especially like the ginger lime vinaigrette.

Their sandwiches are filling and tasty! I'd recommend the Cubano or the Jerked chicken.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

Sandwiches and Salads are both great.  I'd recommend the Cubano.  Dropped a star because the place is very pricey.<//review>

<text>Awesome local cafe with locally roasted coffee, mmm! I had a fabulous light roast, great flavor and a massive breakfast parfait. Ambiance is very nice, wide open windows surrounded by local art on the walls. Owner and employees with friendly happy to serve. Pastries also looked great, including some in house baked items.<//text>< Pics>

Great place! Can’t believe we live five minutes away and hadn’t been here before! Really cute small coffee shop with excellent coffee and a small but delicious sampling of baked goods. All 6 of us found something to suit our fancy. We hung out here with friends visiting from out of town for several hours, and that seemed acceptable and even the norm for this place. Absolutely did not feel rushed in any way whatsoever. Really helpful baristas. Cute decor. Will be back regularly!!<//Review>

<review>Super cute place with very polite staff and excellent coffee!  I ordered a dark roast (which still taste with characteristics of light) americano to start.  Very nice. Food menu is unique, fresh and so many items homemade giving it a wonderful personal charm!  Prices are excellent and reflect the quality of the coffee.  The server confirmed it was organic and fair trade and they roast in house.</review>< pictures>

<username>William Mee<//username><text>Good coffee in the heart of Paso Robles in a really comfortable atmosphere. The food was however surprisingly vegetarian unfriendly: there was very little vegetarian selection and even after confirming that their potato dish was meat-optional, they still served it to me with bacon: a frustrating way to start the day which the coffee didn't really make up for.< /text>< pics>

Took 30 minutes to get a latte (wasn't busy) and 10 more to remake it because it looked even worse than the one in the attached photo.

<Text>Dropped in for an early morning coffee and breakfast bite with my son. First, ambience is terrible - bad acoustics so voices result in a deafening racket. Coffee is passable but there are only two meal choices - bagel/cream cheese/lettuce/tomato or biscuit/egg. More importantly - no substitutes! I was not allowed to have a bagel and egg. I was told that the egg was in exact proportion to the muffin - I said I didn't care, put the egg on the side. Please try again. A conference was held in a back room whereupon the waitress returned and announced still no substitute! Later, an older woman appeared from the back with my egg and muffin - no explanation, no apology. IMHO a first class miserable bi-ch!
20 minutes after ordering, and going to the counter to retrieve my coffee, still no orange juice. 10 minutes after that, I went back to the counter and asked for my juice "OMG, I forgot" replied the waitress. Still, she proceeded to work on new customer orders. Again I went to the counter - "I'd like my orange juice now, please!" At which point, she reached for a plastic cup, swooped up a plastic jug of juice from under the counter and poured me a glass - it took 10 seconds (and hopefully didn't have her spit in it).
So, miserable inattentive service and an owner who doesn't give a sh-t. Avoid if you're looking for a decent breakfast.< /Text>< pictures>

Friendly vibe and helpful staff. Highlights were the smoked salmon bagels and Gibraltar coffees. My daughters also loved their hot chocolates. Recomended.</text>

<text>Awesome place. I like the tater tots that come with the breakfast burritos. Nine times out of ten someone has already used the paper and left the crosswords undone. Good chai. Like, not overly sweetened like at Starbucks.
Comfy chairs and a cute outside eating area.
Parking is a bit rough but I recommend just taking a right onto Spring and parking along the sidewalk there.

Remember. This place isn't a fast food joint. Food orders can take anywhere from five to twenty minutes. Cafes are meant to be places to relax. Don't treat the staff like servants.< /text><pictures>None<//pictures></record></dataset><record>

<text>We got gluten green breakfast sandwiches they literally fell apart. The eggs were extremely dry and I got a Mexican mocha. I got almond milk in it and it was literally sour. I loved the old copy shop that used to be there. $31 for it too, it was extremely terrible my coffee is chunky, I don’t want to chew my coffee!</text><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

This place was Kreuzberg which was amazing everything was on point the food the vibe the chai... today we went and I guess the ownership has adjusted (as the name to City something) and they are taking away the breakfast all day which was the best food and why I go besides the chai which always made my day. Needless to say we tried the sandwiches because we were famished which were okay not great but not bad. I love salad but I didn’t even finish this one however my partner didn’t think it was bad. The smoothie I got was good but hard to drink with thin straws since it was so thick. They took down the wall mural and one of the decor lights which created the ambiance I enjoyed so hopefully they are just in the process of changing and don’t leave it as is because it’s very plain and nothing to draw you in besides the tilted mirror which now just seems out of place.<//review>

Coffee was great vegetarian omelet was horrible, with cold tater tots that were hard. There was no cheese in the "omelet " and the vegetables were a couple pieces of zucchini mixed into the eggs that were overcooked. Ate the toast but I couldn't manage to choke down the rest left my plate in plain sight hoping someone would ask how it was, no one did. So ended up having some toast and coffee for $18 ,not a good deal.</review>

I thought when this placed changed from Amsterdam to Kreutzberg, maybe it would get better.  Unfortunately, it's still a fairly mediocre coffee shop.  The atmosphere is nice, but the customer service hasn't really changed and I always thought it was pretty lacking.  My most recent visit,  I asked for a double espresso and got only a single. And the cost is pretty high.  If you're interested in throwing some money away, go here.  It's not bad, but not worth what you pay.  I would suggest Spearhead, a block or 2 away, if you want quality and Starbucks if you're concerned about cost.< /review>

Cute place, great location and the barista was pleasant...but the coffee...bleh!

I ordered a dirty chai and it tasted neither of coffee or chai. More like room temp ginger milk. The ginger flavor was so overwhelming and bitter and the temperature of my latte was unacceptable. I'm a mom, if I want room temp coffee I'll drink it at home and save the $5. I dumped it out and hit the thru coffee place on 13th. Ordered the same drink and it was perfection.</text>

I love their coffee and pick up a bag of espresso each week.  They are out of the bagged beans quite a bit so I can't give 5 stars.  Service is hipster so sometimes nice ( guy with beard is super nice) other staff appear inconvenienced by customers.  I love the coffee so it actually makes me giggle when I get a staff person annoyed to get coffee at a coffee house.< /Review>

Consistently good espresso drinks. I've had drinks made by about 3 different barristas, all were good.  Not too sweet - as I find  flavored lattes have the potential to b-  but u can still taste the espresso, which is bold,  which I prefer, being a Peets addict...<//Text>

Sweet staff! Great choices. Laura, who was working was super accommodating and made a panini into a salad for me. She let me try all the Kombuchas on tap (sooo good)💗 Got an iced 'poor but sexy' tea - Using stevia leaf instead of the powder really makes a huge difference! Cute place too very calm and peaceful. Definitely recommend!< /Review>

Way over priced. I do not mind paying a little more for the ambience but $ 8 for a single blueberry pancake that measured about 5 -6 inches max was rediculous. I won't be returning.< /Text>

I love this veterinarian. There are other vets that are much fancier and offer a lot of frills that have nothing to do with your pets health. I also felt a bit lost in the crowd with the other vets. This is a very personalized and focused office. You save money by not paying for frivolous extras, can get an appointment quickly, and they know you and your pet.< /text>

We are so lucky to live close to and find Laguna!  The staff were extremely helpful, and the Doctor is so thorough and patient with her explanation, has some amazing techniques (cup of peanut butter around the rim to distract from a shot/vaccination) and has some very practical & user friendly policies (check out in room so as to not juggle dog leash, wallet, signing & dog trying to say hi or hide from other patrons).  As a military family member, we've moved quite a bit & I've had some wonderful vets, but Dr. Kholood Hassan just might be the best ever!  This experience honestly is on par with that which I might have when taking my children to the pediatrician!<//review>

<Review>Laguna Veterinary Care is the most beautiful veterinary hospital I have ever seen, and Dr. Hassan and her staff have personalities to match. My cat is usually wonderful at home and a complete menace at veterinary hospitals (scratching people, yelling, unable to be held), but when I took him to see Dr. Hassan last week, he was calm from the moment he came into the hospital, until the moment he left. She won him over with treats and her calm way. She had a heating pad in the exam room that he loved and he even laid still for a blood test while one of her assistants fed him treats! Thanks to Dr. Hassan, now I know my little guy can be just as good at the vet as he is at home!<//Review>< Pics>

<review>On 2/15/19, I had to go through what every pet owner dreads, and I had to put my sweet baby girl to sleep. I wasn't able to get her into my regular vet, and I didn't want to take her to the emergency vet in Arroyo Grande or Atascadero. Dr. Hassan was able to see me, and was so incredibly kind through the entire process. I can't begin to express my gratitude to Dr. Hassan, and her staff.</review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

< review>
This is honestly one nicest most friendly place I have been. I called in late because I had been refused service AT Morron Bay to put my baby down. At my XXXXXXXXX VET  WHOAfter making the appointment she called and said they would not put my baby who was screaming in pain because I placed a negative comment on here. Any way they heard her pain and told to come now and this was after 5. They took to a sitting room with a comphy sofa. She left and gave us private time. At no time were we rushed. The Dr and assistant we're very compassionate and carring. I found the best vet around!</review>

<text>The staff at this office understands the importance of providing a stress-free atmosphere, quick admittance, and one-on-one personal care for your pet. I was seen by the doctor within 2 minutes of my scheduled appointment and Dr. Kholood Hassan immediately started showing my puppy affection, making sure she was completely accepting of the vet office on her first visit. Dr. Hassan provided my new pup with treats as she continued with her work and answered all of my questions. It was very refreshing to hear her share a lot of the same mentalities I have on responsibilities of pet ownership and when there is an opportunity to save a few extra dollars without negatively impacting your pet's health. After finishing taking care of my pup Dr. Hassan gave me a tour of the facility and spoke about her capabilities as well as her inabilities/limitations which I appreciated very much. It shows a lot of trust between doctor and client as well as a sense of pride by the owner in her practice. I am very happy with my first visit to Laguna Veterinary Hospital and I definitely plan on returning with Dr. Hassan as my puppy's primary veterinarian. Thank you to Dr. Hassan and her caring staff!</text>< Response>

< Review>
My car broke down so im back to traveling by other means but when i had my car this place was the one and only carwash i went to. Still have tokens in my coin container. One time the attendant noticed that i was having trouble, he didn’t hesitate to offer assistance. I highly recommend Oasis for anyone who doesn’t  want to spend too much and likes to keep their car clean<//Review>

$1.25 for 2 min bay wash time. I spent like $10 but it's cool no doubt better than any drive thru wash. 1 vacuum per 2 parking spots. Everything coin operated(quarters or wash tokens) token machines for bills up to $20 and one for card touchless and swipe so it'll take Samsung and Google pay IDK about apple pay.. @eddie_va1 @loonytuners_official insta< /Text>

<review>Great clean space, friendly attendants. Price is hard to beat, though it'd be better if the machine gave quarters instead of tokens because if I don't use all of the tokens they start to collect in my car, which can get pretty annoying.</review>< Pictures>

Very late night car wash with the girlfriend but it was fun found a place that only 1.25 starts the water and time for you know the other places will charge $2 sometimes $2.25.< /Review>

This place is amazingly clean and there is always an attendant there. The attendants wear green polos and you can't miss them. The only con I can think of is how they now increased the price to $1.25 instead of $1.00 for 2 minutes but that's a small price to pay for how safe and clean the bays are.</Text>

<username>J barrera<//username><Text>I washed my truck here and when i was drying it i noticed the brush left marks on my truck. i have a black truck you could see the brush marks all over.  They need to replace the brushes more often or get better ones now i have to get my truck buffed and polished. Also note that the air pressure hoses spit out grease and oil along with the air. I told the worker and owner and said no and was ignored i showed him by pointing it on my side mirror glass and it left it al greasy and oily so won't be going there anymore if you have a dark color car stay away the brushes will scratch your paint.< /Text>< date>

<Text>This car was is great... Vacuums work well they have compressed air lines to blow off your car everything works well... You can trade in left over tokens for your cash back... Only down side is that this place is always busy so you'll be waiting for a stall and the dry stalls are super close together so you have to watch out for careless people dinging your doors...< /Text><username>F U</username>< Pictures>

Coin operated car wash that only takes tokens. You will can either use cash or card. You can trade in tokens if you don't use all of them. It will cost at least 4 dollars to get your car covered in soap and rinsed off. The soap in the brush it very thick and takes a little work to get off your car. I would suggest it to anyone who wants to save a few bucks on a car wash. If you want to spend a few more dollars you can go to one of the drive through car washes. As you can see in the photo there are multiple stalls. Sometimes it is packed so don't always expect to get a stall right away.</Text>

I really like this car wash. It is kept clean. There's usually an attendant on duty. It does get pretty busy but worth the short wait there may be. They have the air pressure hoses to dry your car for free and all the equipment is well maintained. It's my favorite carwash.< /Text>

<rating>2< /rating><text>I've washed my car here a couple of times here before, and the experience is great. Big bang for your buck.

Customer service is ass. I put in a five dollar bill and the machine ate it. No tokens, no nothing. I asked the worker on site if he could get my five dollar bill back.
He tested the machine himself and it spat out some tokens. Unlucky right?

He said that I could come back and speak to the owner another time, but there was nothing he could he could do.  This is perfectly understandable.

The thing is, he proceeds to call me a liar and thief, and proceeds to say that to my own father (who was with me at the time). He says it happens all the time and that your (me) son is a thief and lied about the machine stealing five dollars.

If you come here and the machine eats your money, don't expect a good time from some of the workers.

I'm returning tomorrow to wash my parent's car, and try to get my 5 dollars back. I don't expect to, but I might as well try. Will update later.<//text><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None< /resp><gmap_id>0x80dd27e4d0a26cd5:0x42c8bd22f4dd80df<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

This is my go to car wash, always clean and it has air houses to help dry off your vehicle.  You buy tokens for the wash and vacuums.  Weekend it gets very busy but worth the wait and easy to find.< /review>

I always wash my car here but the worker and the owner are pretty rude. They both need to have better communication skills using manners. I brought my own brush because there brush scratches my car and they came up to me saying I can’t do that here.. that I’m taking forever. I only spend 2-3$ hell I ain’t taking forever lmao that’s how ridiculously they are. They will also stare at you as if you’re theives. Another time I went and the worker cane up to me telling me I’m taking a long time when clearly the car next to me been there longer. ‘A long time’ I was barely starting. I was only there for about 2 minutes pulling my car up to wash. Then I called him out on it and he said “I listen to my boss. He tell me come tell you’ .. if they’re reading this then they know.<//Review>

This place has everything you need to get your car neat and tidy but recently gotten super packed so I had to find a different place to go to. Never thought I'd wait in a long line to wash my car myself.< /Review>

The owner here was so rude. I was looking for my money in my purse and had been there less than a minute and he came up knocking on my window telling me to hurry up because other people were waiting to wash. When I told him I was just getting my money he said oh well hurry up you should of had it ready. The car wash is clean but the owner is complete rude and unappreciative that he is getting your business. I will be taking mine somewhere else next time and so should you.<//review>

Good location. I especially like the air blowers to blow out water from crevices. I can't give it more stars because there is a slipping safety hazard if you walk just outside of the wash area. I, myself, slipped and fell on my last visit. A maintenance associate saw and told me, "You gotta be careful because it's slippery. A lady fell earlier today, as well!" Hmmm, that might indicate there is an issue that needs to be addressed. But it won't deter me from going back. That air blower is too good to pass up!<//review>

Confused at the payment system where you pay at a machine to get special coins to activate the car wash. Other than that no other problems; it's clean, there's a lot of stalls, and there's only a short wait.</Text>

< Review>
I'm very picky when I comes to my cars appearance and always personally hand wash it , so I go to alot of different coin-op car washs. I like this place because its is never crowded, theres no annoying music that someone always apparently thinks is everyone elses favorite so they turn it loud enough to drown out the sound of the vacuums and Its reasonably priced. What makes this place stand out to me is their free compressed air hoses they provide that are strong enough to do a spot free dry on your car and easily blow out the debris from all the hard to reach areas in the interior.</Review>

<review>Like any Gong Cha, their boba is great. When seating was open to the public, the upstairs environment was a pleasant place to sit and do some reading. Overall it's clean and efficient, and the staff are friendly and understanding.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

Ordered an earl grey milk tea. The team is delicious, top notch. Straw is cool, some sort of recycled paper I think? Neat texture. Bobas are cooked well, but plain - not sweetened with honey or brown sugar or anything. I'd prefer sweeter or flavored bobas. Not the best boba I've had in SF, but good! Recommended.<//Text>

Great boba chain with consistent and good boba. I’m not saying that it’s amazing, but it does all the classic milk tea drinks pretty well.

Edit: I had the taro milk tea with pudding and I still tasted taro the next day...< /Text>

Good boba place in SF. Recommend strawberry milk tea with 0 sugar. Note that on a lot of the flavored drinks, 0 sugar is still extremely sugary.</review>

The only time I've ever thrown out my bubble tea without finishing it. It doesn't taste like any of the other bubble tea I've had, from T4 or sharetea, etc. It has a different kind of 'off taste' and the tapioca is very hard to chew.< /Text>

I ve been to a lot of different gong cha locations (at least 5 different ones in Sydney, and 1 in New York), this one is fairly underwhelming in terms of drink quality. Pearls were undercooked but overall it's still okay<//review>

Literally the slowest place ever. Waited 20min and the line hasn’t even moved. The employees were chatting and slow and not even minding the long line waiting. Been to so many boba places and this one was literally the slowest. Two parties in line who were waiting before me left before I did, guess coz they have been here for forever.<//review>

Yess! I've been waiting for the SF location to open since the beginning of the year, it's been such a long suspenseful wait! I was hoping I would be the first customer and first reviewer haha.

I have always loved the quality of the Palo Alto location and believe that their milk tea is the closest to Taiwan's in the bay area. The boba is also the closest you can get here in the bay, it doesn't melt in your mouth like it does in Taiwan, but it's still honey sweet and chewy.

This location is good, but not as good as the Palo Alto location because the tea taste isn't as strong. However, I'm still rating it 5 stars because this is the best boba milk tea in the city after growing up here and seeing the quality of boba go downhill over the years.

And yes, boba guys don't come even close, it's definitely overrated and not authentic.
Gongcha is more authentic because they have a creamy taste in their milk tea similar to Taiwan's.

If you can't instantaneously travel to Taiwan but have a crazy craving for boba, definitely come here!< /Text>

Smaller than other gong cha places. The line at the counter was small but took long time to get my turn to order. They responded rudely when I asked to put less ice in my drink. Even my drink was not properly made compared to the other times I had it. Very disappointed!!< /Review>

<Review>(Translated by Google) Taiwan does not have sparkling QQ passion fruit. Can not adjust the sweetness, the passion fruit concentrated syrup used is a bit too sweet.

< review>
I applied for a sears credit card. I did not get approved which was weird cause I've never gotten denied anywhere I have applied but they told me that I got approved for their leasing program. I found a grill I really liked and had to have it so I asked them to explain the leading program to me. They explained it to me pretty much as a rent to own. I would have to make 5 payments and It would be mine. So currently 6 payments in I decided to find out why the payment is still coming out of my account.  Come to find out that it's not a rent to own type lease, it's more of a pay more then what the grill is worth and then tell you that you can outright purchase it for another 200 bucks when I've already paid over 300, for a 300 dollar grill. This is complete bull. They lied to me in store and we're very unprofessional and didn't have great customer service skills. So now I'm paying close to 600 bucks or I return it. Don't get caught in this scam.!!!!< /review>

Went in store on April 1st and Ordered almost $3000 worth of furniture and paid for delivery to my house. The delivery date (April 12) keeps getting postponed week after week. Now they’re telling me it won’t be delivered until April 26. Their store does not pick up their phones at all.< /review>

<review>My husband and I needed new appliances for our home and we are so happy we purchased them through Sears. We had an absolutely wonderful and knowledgeable salesman Chris R who helped us find the best brand and deals for our budget. He let us know when the appliances we wanted were going on sale and when the sale price didn't go through as planned he still matched the price for us. It was listed as $700 and it was supposed to go on sale to $567 but for some reason it didn't, but he still honored the sale price. The manager Ray is fantastic and is the reason we got the price we did because he approved Chris to give it to us. From beginning to end we felt taken care of. Both gentlemen have superb customer service and we will definitely be returning.< /review>< Pics>

Quality service starts with proper information,  don’t waste people’s time with your  in-accurate schedule.  You have posted on your website and also In front of your dealer that you operate from 10am to 7pm weekdays.  Yes I understand things can change but I also know that it doesn’t take much to change the info on your hours of operations.< /Text>

<text>What A WONDERFUL experience with this family owned and operated business!! We bought a 2017 Kia Soul for our daughter on 12/30/20. From the initial call about the car, test drive, having the car checked by an outside mechanic to purchase, the entire family were professional and helpful! Better pricing than the dealership. Thanks Abramovich! Blessings!!< /text>< Pics>

On 05/16 we purchased a 2017 VW Jetta and it was an incredible experience! A big thank you to Lana who helped us through the entire process. Along with her, the entire team was very accommodating and never failed to acknowledge your presence! Thank you a thousand times - by far the fastest, easiest, and best car-buying experience!</text>

Sold me car with frame damage and electrical problems. Should’ve known when they got me to sign contract with little more mileage than what was first stated on carfax and made up a reason for that. Will be seeing what I can do through an attorney. BEWARE DON’T BUY here. Prices seem extremely good for a reason!<//review>

< Review>
About 7 months ago I called about a VW Passat I found on their website. I forgot who I spoke to but they were extremely kind and explained everything perfectly. She offered to put my application in for the car over the phone since I lived two hours away. She called me back within hours to tell me that I qualified and to tell me what my APR and monthly payments would be.

I went into the dealer and everyone I encountered had amazing customer service. The woman that assisted me was the wife of the owner. The Owner was very friendly. It is a family owned business and everyone gets along very well. They make you feel like part of the family.

It has been 7 months and I have had no problems with the car at all. The only minor issue I noticed is that all my tired are different brands but all in good condition. The car has been amazing. The customer service was amazing as well.

They made everything as easy as possible for me.

My car came with a spare tire, all the tools required and a tire lock. It was very organized.

My boyfriend bought a VW Passat from a different dealer before I bought mine and his came with no tools, no tire lock, and a poor spare tire. He also paid more for an older model with more miles.

I got a great deal for the year and model of the vehicle I bought. I would highly recommend buying a car from them!< /Review>

My dad recently bought two cars from here. Purchasing both of the cars was overall a great experience and if we ever need another car we will be sure to come here first. The second car was actually a gift to me! The staff were extremely helpful when it came to making sure the car was delivered in time for my birthday and that the car was looking perfect! I highly recommend purchasing a car through Abramovich  Motors.</Text>

We have purchased 3 cars from Abramovich Motors and we always have a pleasant buying experience.  There is zero pressure and no slick salesperson hounding you constantly.  Their prices are always the best so it's worth the hour drive for us to buy from them.  The whole family is just a delight to work with.  We willl be lifelong customers!<//review>

This place lacks professionalism and super shady! I drove 2 hours to test drive a car and told them I would like to purchase it. I made an appt to come back the next morning to buy the car. I offered to give a deposit to hold the car, I was assured that it was mine and that was not needed. A few hours later they called me to let me know the car was SOLD! This company lacks integrity and very dishonest. Also, nothing on their website is accurate! The cars are priced well as they all have had damage to them. Do your diligence before purchasing from these guys!< /Text>

Best car buying experience we’ve ever had by far. We were so happy with their sales process afforded to my wife on her Benz purchase that we went back and bought my Audi 4 days later.<//Text>

Abram Motors was fantastic to deal with. The whole car buying experience was wonderful. We didn't realize they closed at 4pm on a Saturday and they stayed late to finish paperwork for my wife and I. I highly recommend!<//Review>

I visited twice and just settled the car I want today. Zade is the Sale representative who took care of me, and I have to say that I am very satisfied with his service.  I am a super detailed and cautious person, and I always have millions of questions when comes to financial related decision, and his patience and professionalism definitely are the greatest help throughout the transaction. Most importantly, he is very honest to his clients, which I see it as extremely valuable character for a sales person. He has no hesitation every time I have a request to him, and he has been done his best to meet all my needs. This is a happy and easy process to me, highly recommend him!</Review>

A lot of choice in cars.  Very reasonable prices and low mileage.  No haggling.</Text>

My family and I have purchased three cars from this dealer already. I was highly impressed with the professionalism, customer service and knowledge of the staff member at Abramovich Motors. I currently live in Hawaii and typically it takes months to process a car transfer/paperwork, but this team made it all happen within two weeks, which is usually unrealistic. I highly recommend this dealership, where the selection is great with the best deals!!!</review>

<text>Bought a car at the best deal in the market. Before going to Abramovich Motors I dealt with other dealers pushing you into out of budget options, but with them it was the opposite, they listened to what I wanted and provided it. The car was impeccable, the service was awesome, Vadim and Anya were very receptive, attentive nice and chatty to me. The place looks very nice and clean, loved that they had so many toys for kids to play in the meantime.</text>< Resp>

I recently purchased a car from Abramovich Motors and I must say it was one of the best car buying experiences that I have ever had. Working with Anya and Yevi was great and they went above and beyond my expectations to make sure everything was taken care of in order for us to get the car. We had traveled in from out of town so Anya made sure that we had plenty of suggestions and recommendations of places to go and things to see in Temecula. Overall a fantastic experience.  I will definitely be buying more cars from them in the future.<//Review>

Family owned business run by some very good people and because it's not too big, you feel comfortable speaking to and possibly making a sound purchasing decision with these folks. The cars they sell are for the most part in almost always very good to excellent condition.<//review>

Well, bravo. You guys got me on a technicality, and apparently a number of other customers as well.

If you're looking at buying from Abramovich make sure you THOROUGHLY read and understand ALL of the documents they have you sign and initial.  They love to tout the "clean carfax"... which is technically true at the time you buy the car.  Even if they know something just hasn't made it on the Carfax report yet.

If you're like me and don't pay close enough attention to the "Statement of Facts" under sub-section "G" you might not realize you're signing away on "structural damage per auction announcement".  A few months or years later you'll check the Carfax again and see the structural damage on there. But not on the "clean" Carfax Abramovich gives you. Sometimes it takes awhile for the damage to update on Carfax.

My personal opinion? Abramovich knows this and likes to work in the gray area, but.... i can't prove it. So what do I know?

Shame on me for letting that one slip by. I didn't want to believe it was true, but there was my signature. Unfortunately, I'm not the only one who's been awe struck at, what appears to be, such a great deal on a car.  Check out other Yelp, Google, and BBB reviewers on this place, and you'll see other customers who fell for it too.

Just make sure you read those forms closely and understand what you're signing.<//Text>

<Text>Abramovich family greeted my wife, Daughter and I with a smile and a handshake. Pasha and Vadim was very professional, treated us like royalty. Pasha took the time to go over all the special features our car has even showing my wife how the hands free features work. Anya in finance was a pleasure. She is kind friendly and explained the financial end of the deal with clarity and ease. It was nice that the general manager and the sales manger took the time to stop by and say hello to my wife, Daughter and I.
If you are looking for a Mercedes Benz, ABRAMOVICH MOTORS is the place to go.<//Text><resp>None</resp>< Rating>

Limit the number of questions you have before buying otherwise you won’t hear back from them. Wonder what kind of after sales they would provide.</review>

<text>I'm purchasing and shipping 2016 CLA 250 Sport P1 PKG to Minnesota for my son.
It's very rare car in Minneapolis and usually $4000 more expensive.
So far experience from initial contact was excellent.
Anya and Lana are very knowledgeable,  honest and very helpful.
We are very excited and looking forward working with Abramovich Motors.
If you looking for a vehicle they have awesome inventory.
Thank you.< /text></record>

I love my car, the reviewers made me kind of nervous but the car turned out better then they listed, I took a star away because they got some weird relationship with Ally financial, get your own financing- Ally is the worst bank in the world.< /Review>

This was the best car buying experience I have ever had.  They are a family run business with true family values.  I was running late past closing time and they did not hesitate to stay open late to complete my purchases. They are not there to sell you anything, but more to help guide you through your car buying experience.  They are very open to answers and questions you have concerning your cars and will answer with 100 % true facts. They don’t pressure you into any extras like extended warranties and such.  Defiantly go back for my next car.<//text>

<Text>I was looking for months for a c300 AMG package with no luck in Las Vegas, "the valley automall" more like overpriced auto mall, anyways  one day abramovich motors popped up on my FB timeline i found the perfect c300 low miles at an unbeatable price  they had a few choices  I gave them a call  next day I was on the road 300 miles away from home to go pick it up, I arrived they cleaned the car they let me test drive it at my own pace and left me alone with the car to inspect it witch I did "car guy here" and it was perfect.. everybody was a business professional, whoever owns the place has good taste in vehicles, no base models here !  Anyways thank you again this is the place to buy  lightly used Benz saved me 5k instead of Vegas prices.. let's say the round trip of 600 miles  was worth it go check them out!<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

After getting into a car accident, I found myself looking for another car. After days of searching for a Hyundai, I came across a listing on Abramovich Motors. The price was extremely reasonable for a dealer, and it left me wondering if it's just too good to be true. The next day I went down to their beautiful warehouse of beautiful cars. I had someone with me qualified to perform a pre-purchase inspection. It turned out the car was really a great car for a great deal! Abramovich Motors is family owned and operated. The family is very nice and honest. Definitely not your typical car salesmen. They weren't pushy or sketchy at all. It's no haggle, because they really do price their cars to sell. I am very happy with my purchase. 😊</review>

Bought a used car here and 2 weeks later I had over $2000 in repairs that needed to be fixed. Recently found out the car had fire damage and frame damage that they never told me about either. Be careful buying a used car from these guys.</text>

<review>My experience at Abramovich Motors was the most pleasant buying experience I have ever had! I never leave reviews but i had to share. From the minute my husband and I walked in, to the financing and the test drive was just the best. Everyone was so nice, honest and refreshing. I will recommend Abramovich Motors to everyone I know. They even filled up the tank on my test drive!

<Text>My wife and I had a wonderful experience purchasing a car from Abramovich Motors. We came in because of an ad for a different vehicle, but when the numbers didn't work out, Lana and Anya were able to help us select another car that would work with our budget. They were extremely helpful and forthcoming and they made us feel comfortable and welcome--like part of the family; not at all pushy or intimidating like other car dealers that I've worked with. We ended up with a beautiful 2011 Ford Flex with very low miles that runs really well and looks amazing. We will definitely come back here the next time we need another car and recommended them to all of our friends and family.<//Text>< Pics>

They were upfront and honest. I went to 5 different dealerships before this one, and this is the only one that was straightforward and didn't add in random fees. The staff is friendly and even follows up on a daily bases after they sold me a vehicle. I would highly suggest visiting them if you're looking for a car.</review>

Amazing dealer! I drove approximately 3hrs to purchase my car at this dealer. The process was extremely easy and quick. I was in and out with my new car in very little time which I loved because my drive back was very long. It's a family owned dealer and all the staff were extremely friendly and very nice. I got a great deal in my car and my overall experience for my first time car purchase wasn't as scary as I imagined because they are not your typical "pushy" car salesman.<//Review>

<rating>1</rating><text>Buyers beware!!! THIS PLACE IS A SCAM!!! I purchased a 2015 Z28 2 yrs ago, I went to a different dealership to trade-in and try to purchase a newer car. I wast told that the value of my car was half of what is worth because It was frame damaged. They knew that the car was frame damaged and they sold it to me like that. The car fax that they showed me did not show anything !!! because it takes some time to show in car fax. I talked to one of the owners YEVI and I asked for his help and his answer was sorry but your car is not worth the current value....I wonder WHY??? So please have your cars inspected before you buy cars from this guys. I made a mistake and trusted them. Just looked at their website and their CAR FAXES. Most  of their cars have have some kind of damaged or accidents. Because they buy them at a action for cheap prices and sell them to their customers for top dollar. If you want to avoid headaches and  have peace of mind do yourself a favor and DON"T TRUST THESE PEOPLE THEY ARE  A BIG FAMILY OF RUSSIAN THIEVES!!
And Please look at the YELP reviews towards the BOTTOM . You can see like bad 48 reviews including my review. Somehow they can control YELP reviews!!!< /text><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None<//resp>< Gmap_id>

I found them on the web searching for a used car, I saw the good reviews and had to see for myself.  Take reviews, as this one, with a grain of salt.  Go see for yourself.  They had the best price on the car I was looking for, beating private sellers prices.  I didn't have to haggle with them at all, price of the car was well below book value and I was very confident I was getting a good deal price wise.   They don't have a lot of stock, but what they have, from what I saw looking around, were the most popular cars you see driving on the road today.  All looked very clean and in good condition.  I will definitely be buying my next used car from them.</Text>< pics>

They're genuine and professional.
No non-sense.
We purchased a 2013 BMW
Fair price. Very clean car ...
Also, we noticed several different cars in many price ranges. I.e. Worth the visit online or in person no matter what you're shopping for.
My husband and I were impressed.

You'll be satisfied with their integrity whether you purchase from them or not.

I bought a 2015 Kia Optima and about a month later it broke down...repair shop advised doing a major repair that would cost thousands. I got in contact with the -smart auto care- extended warranty company and Abramovich motors as well to help out with the process, thanks to them the warranty company made a quicker decision!< /review>

Excellent customer service and easy negotiation and purchase process.  These young guys understand that the key to their success is having the customers walk away with a successful car-buying experience.  Lovely facility in a relaxed atmosphere only adds to the positive experience.< /Review>

Out of state buyer that really appreciated the team effort at Abramovich.  They stood behind their product,  assisted in getting me an independent 3rd party mechanic to look at the car,  and even coordinated shipping to AZ for me.  The car is clean, and just as advertised.  If you are looking for a purchase and don't love the traditional dealership experience I'd suggest giving Yevi and his team a shot at your business.</review>

Do NOT do business with this family!! Little did we know that two years ago when we bought a car from them they would cover up information and tell lie after lie to sell us a car illegally that had been in an accident and considered unsafe to drive. We went today to trade in the car and when the commercial dealership we were at pulled the car fax report on the car we were shocked to find out the car had been in an accident with structural damage. We came home to look at the car fax report we were given also had our signatures from Abramovich Motors two years ago and low and behold, they printed the car fax report on 01/20/14,m in the morning, the car was reported in the accident 01/20/14 and was sold to us on 01/30/14 and they told us the car fax was up to date. They were able to print the "clean" car fax report and then report the accident/structural damage later that day. What a bunch of low life liars!! The brother sister team said what a great, safe and reliable car it was. We have all of our paperwork and plan to take legal action. Don't let this family scam you like they did us!!
UPDATE; Abramovich Motors bought the car back from my husband and I no questions asked, interesting, huh? They did not have one single document on the car they had sold us just two years ago. What was their reason for selling us the car illegally, well  they really didn't have one other than there was a mix up. Oh and I should probably mention that they wrote us a check for the wrong amount (check should have only been for the unpaid off portion of the car) then promised to overnight us the correct amount and it came 3 days later in the mail. Didn't seem to bother them that we were down to one car and waiting on the money to buy a new car. Just be very, very, very careful when you read all of the positive feedback for Abramovich Motors...<//Text>

My experience with the professionals at Abramovich Motors was outstanding. They greeted me with a smile and a firm handshake. They answered every question that i asked in regards to the car that I was interested in. The car, a 2013 Hyundai Sonata, was in clean, excellent condition. Their open and friendly attitude, as well as very welcoming, will bring me back when the time comes to look for another car.<//Review>

I read the reviews so thought I would check them out, went there AFTER making an appt like I was going to a doctor, and they don't like answering questions, will not negotiate one penny, act like they are doing you a favor, at least some of the cars have been in accidents. There is zero professionalism from this bunch.
Do what you want but I will NEVER waste my time there again. I think these fantastic reviews were made by themselves.. notice you don't see any bad reviews, .as they are nothing like the reviews.</review>

<review>This family is the BEST to deal with.  Car was advertised for a GREAT price, i had been shopping for months and couldn't believe the price and the mileage was so low.
got there worried about up selling and usual car buying drama and there was NONE! it  was the best car buying experience EVER!
When i need another car, I WILL look here first.  It was worth the over one hour drive from Rancho Cucamonga.
Once again, GREAT family, Great Car!  I will be back!</review><userid>109322509078663148818</userid><gmap_id>0x80db68bb6e6cb7d3:0x9185e4c7bbfa7a3e< /gmap_id>< pictures>

I recently purchased my  BMW 528i, 2013 from Abramovich Motors and it was my best car purchase ever. The price was right, no pressure and their family environment customer service helped to sealed the deal. I've watched the holiday car commercials for many years and thanks to my experience with Abramovich Motors I can wrap my BMW with a bow.<//review>

Giving “As Is” a whole new meaning. I have mixed feelings on my experience buying a car here. It didn’t start well when I went to purchase my Honda Pilotonly to find out that the price listed was a mistake - and that they were increasing it $2k. Fine, I’ll do my best to trust that it was just an error and not them being shady as soon as I showed interest. Then it was the constant back and forth of bad information- to which I’ll assume was again just innocent human error. So, I get to the dealership to buy the car and the representatives are very nice and helpful- no complaints there. I do a thorough go through of the vehicle notating some minor damages - which, for the price are acceptable - but notice that it’s pretty dirty. I mean, they knew I came to buy the car and while I can see the exterior had been washed the inside had basically only been vacuumed. I would have expected the car to be detailed and shampooed in the least from a reputable dealership. I can absolutely without a doubt tell you that it was not - and this is how I know. When I decided to shampoo it myself (the morning after purchasing) I started to move the seats and found old dried vomit under the seat. Like a pretty generous amount - NOT easy to miss! I’m a mom of two. I know vomit well. Cleaning your own kids vomit is pretty awful, cleaning another person’s old dried stinky vomit is a new experience. So anyway, I stuck it up and detail the car myself. The carpet cleaner water was BLACK. It was soooo filthy. But it’s done and I’m loving my car. So you decide what you’re willing to put up with for a good deal.</review>

Stay clear of this place. They will lowball you on appraisals and some of their cars are not certified. Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere..< /text>

Great deal on the car I bought for my wife, family business, very straight forward worth the 2.5 hr drive, was missing a couple little things, but it was a used car so what can you expect.  I would recommend them, very friendly and awesome customer service made the buying experience very easy!</Review>

DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SCAM DEALERSHIP!!!! THEY ARE ALL LIARS!!!!
I bought a 2014 Volkswagen Jetta from Abramovich Motors July 06, 2017. Just after a year of owning the car I went to Volkswagen of Alhambra to trade in my car to see how much they would give me for it so I could purchase a vehicle from them, the dealership told me we cannot buy your vehicle due to STRUCTURAL DAMAGE!!. I bought a CarFax and reviewed it myself after Volkswagen of Alhambra told me it was in an accident and told the Volkswagen dealer that I had no idea that the car had this damage when I bought it from Abramovich Motors. I then proceeded to pull all the documents I had from when I purchased the vehicle. I found one document out of the 20 I signed that stated in very small writing that the car had structural damage. I also found the 2 copies of CarFax they sold to me with the vehicle that stated the vehicle had never been in an accident and had no previous history of an accident. I compared the CarFax they gave to me to the CarFax I purchased that night and saw that the accident was reported 7 days before I purchased it from Abramovich Motors. When I purchased the vehicle from Abramovich Motors I took the vehicle to Volkswagen of Murrieta to get a service to make sure the car was serviced and to take advantage of the warranty that was still left on the car and there was no verbal or documentation from Volkswagen of Murrieta that the car was in an accident either. I found out CarFax takes up to a couple months to report accidents or damage to their reports. I then was furious and called Abramovich motors and spoke to the owner Yevi. He proceeded to tell me he can't do anything about it because they sold me the car with telling me that it had structural damage. I am not the only one who this has happened to obviously because there is 10 other reviews with the same type of problem that I have had. I will be pursuing legal action and gaining the full amount of money that I purchased the car for back. If anyone has this same situation with this dealership please contact me.</review>

I am reading the reviews and I did not get that warm fuzzy feeling from the salesmen. It is raining heavy out, no customer that I can see. I went in for a specific car, I  was told it was sold yesterday.  The salemen didnt asked if I wanted to see anything else. It appeared as though they didn't or have time for my business. Could it have been because of my Nationality???  However the showroom was very nice, it reminded me of the Mercedes dealer, where I purchased my Mercedes from in San Francisco.
I will never recommend this dealership to anyone.<//Text>

<UserId.>106401874046712770999</UserId.><name>marc lewis< /name><Time>1515517292513</Time><Rate>1< /Rate><review>I came across this company through CarGuru and  submitted an application online with these people over the weekend for a vehicle they had. That was on Saturday morning. Never heard from them. I left a voicemail on Tuesday without a callback, then had to call again on Weds. A woman answered. I explained the situation and was told she would call back with information about what is happening. It is Thursday afternoon, and no call back still. I am usually very guarded with my personal info, so I am not sure what made me feel comfortable providing all of my personal info in a credit app on their site. That is terrible customer service. I am very uneasy now with this company  having my personal data.

UPDATE 01/09/2018:
I got a call from the original woman I was able talk to weeks back on 1/5/18 saying she had seen my review and wanted to apologize for not getting back to me. She said they were not aware of it, but she was the lady I talked to by phone and asked her what was going on with the credit submission. She was going to check it out and get back to me. If I hadn't spoke my mind here, I probably never would have heard back from them. I already have a new car, and asked that the application be destroyed. Take this all for what it is worth to you. Used car dealers are a dime a dozen though. Choose one carefully, or by certified pre-owned from a new car dealer.< /review>< pictures>

Just this past week, we bought a Hyundae Sonata.  Our buying experience with Abramovich Luxury Autos was very pleasant. My wife and I are very happy with the purchase and even happier with the price.  The next time you are looking for a car stop by and see their selection.  You will be glad you did.  Keep up the good work Yevi and Nadia.

P.S. I have already place my order for my next car, BMW in 6 months.  I look forward to doing business with them again.< /review>

Beware internet buyers... Vadim and I settled on a price that he said was agreed to by "the boss." However, when (according to him) other buyers showed up, the price was no longer the price, and they would only sell it if I paid $1000 more. Better off staying away from this "bait and switch" business.</review>

BUYER BEWARE! Me and my wife purchased a 2014 lexus es 350 from Abramovich about a year ago. When we bought the car a clean carfax was presented to us. Today we went to have the car appraised and we were presented with a carfax that showed a major repair including frame damage. This obviously seriously diminished the value of the car. I contacted Abramovich to give them the opportunity to take the car back and they were unwilling to work with us and I will now be forced to take legal action to try and recoupe my losses . I see in a previous review that this has happened to someone else as well. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS ESTABLISHMENT.</Review>

I bought a car a few weeks ago from Yevi at Abramovich Luxury Autos.  It was a great deal, in excellent shape, and the price was very reasonable.  While Yevi has an accent, he was able to communicate clearly and a very straight-forward salesman and very open through the entire process.  If they have a car you are interested in, I highly recommend giving them a call.<//review>

Be very careful buying your car from this place! Yes, their cars are very clean, but that's about it. I saw a Hyundai Sonata advertised on autotrader, I was informed that it was previously a rental vehicle, but was also told that the car is up to date and everything has been done and in good condition.

There was imperfections on the body of the car. Nicks, dents and scratches here and there. Stains on the seats.. Nothing major, but since I was paying in full, I figured I could get a better deal due to those issues. The younger guy who was initially helping me, constantly kept telling me the dents and nicks were unnoticeable, and that at night, you wouldn't even see it. He also said it's so minor that I won't need to fix it. I thought to myself, am I buying the car or are you buying it? Is it your money or mine? I also informed him that there was a more prestine Sonata we saw a few days prior for a better deal, but someone else bought it before we could. He kept questioning me, arguing with me and even spent time on his phone checking autotrader ads! Makes me wonder, they know what they can give the car to me for, what's the point of standing there, checking the competitors, wasting everyone's time. Either we're going to do this deal or not. That's all I wanted. I didn't want to go back and forth. I told them I was paying cash. In addition, I had just gotten off a 9 hr shift and took a two hour drive in traffic from San Diego.

So after dealing with the little guy, the big brother comes to save him from his terrible sales technique. He gave me the closest price, I agreed and closed the sale.

As he was driving home, about 20 miles in, he noticed a rotating, rocking type sound coming from the back wheels at around 60-70 mph. He informed me of it, but I told him he was probably listening a little too hard. So I decided to drive it. Initially everything sounded good for about 10 miles. I started noticing it and the car also felt like it was rocking.

2 days after having the car, the tire pressure light came on for the rear left tire, where the noise was coming from. Fast forward to 4 days after. We took it to the dealership and found out the alignment is off, so it caused the car to rock, which made the two back wheels wear from the inside out. The dealership also informed us that the air filters has never been changed. Estimated repairs will cost about $500.

We called yevi to inform him of it. We tried being polite, but he began arguing with us saying that it was normal wear and tear on the tires and that we just need to change it. We emphasized that he told us the car was in good condition. He just kept defending himself and arguing, saying this is "normal wear and tear". It wasn't getting anywhere. I understand the usual wear on tires, but this car is at 38k miles, and the type of rocking was not "normal". The type of wear on the tires was not "normal". Yet, the man kept arguing. So finally at the end he tells us to drive the car BACK to Murrieta and he will replace the tires. SERIOUSLY? That's the best you can do and you own a dealership? Is that how you resolve issues? I guess now we have to fork out $200 for repairs and find the time to drive all the way back out there, wasting time and money. Ill probably just save my time and energy and deal with this myself, rather than going back to deal with them again. Way to go guys!!!! I will be reporting to the BBB.

Note: They will trick you by putting a paper on the dashboard of each car with it checked as "warranty OR as-is". However, all vehicles have it checked for "warranty" but when they have you sign the papers, they may have you sign for as-is no warranty (the same paper, but this time they will switch it to 'as-is') and will explain that the car is still under manufacturer warranty and that the original dealership will take care of any issues, not them. Very misleading. So keep an eye on that. Additionally, they didn't wash my car after I made the purchase. I should listened to my gut feelings.

BE CAREFUL! DON'T FALL FOR THE PRETTY CARS AND YELP REVIEWS.</review>

<review>My wife and I had an amazing experience with Abramovich Motors.  We have never purchased a car online and were skeptical.  We live in Kansas City and Abramovich Motors is in California.  After deciding on a 2013 BMW X6 we went to our local bank and had all of the financing done.  Yevi, the owner, sent all of the paperwork overnight to me and I took it to the bank.  Yevi and my bank collaborated from there and completed the transaction.  Yevi shipped our car from California and we had it in 4 days.  Yevi also went above and beyond for us.  After we received the car we notices a couple of really small scratches on the hood and Yevi purchased the repair touch up paint and sent that to us.  Yevi also notice we had a low tire when he shipped the car.  He told me to take it to our BMW dealership and have the tire replace and that he would reimburse me.  The cost of the tire with labor was $479.48.  I sent Yevi the receipt and he mailed me a check within a week.  Abramovich Motors is solid online dealer with a high level of integrity and amazing low prices on their vehicles.  I hope Abramovich motors is still in business when I need my next vehicle.  Thank you Yevi for the fantastic experience!

So good! I got the Nutella funnel cake to share with my siblings. It came with ice cream and whipped cream on top. The staff was also super friendly and explained things on the menu for us. Highly recommend!<//review>

<text>This is a busy location. Workers were unable to keep up with who arrived first and skipped 3 people including myself when taking orders. Overall the place makes very good food. And could probably use another hand behind the counter.</text>< Pics>

< Review>
Staff is friendly & the treats are yummy!  The neighborhood was a big outdoor party when we visited on a friday evening.  The funnel cakes are the highlight of the menu, but they have so many other options too!  My favorite item was the real fruit mango slushee (raspado). The smoothie was healthy & fresh...exactly what my husband was looking for.  The churro was caramel-custard-filled & fresh.  I ordered a "custom" funnel cake w/ banana mousse & cherries and the whole family enjoyed it.  We didn't love the fruity pebble milkshake.  Next time we'll try the fried ice cream, which they were out of.< /Review>

<Text>This is a true Diamond in the Rough! Never would you expect such a quaint place hiding in the corner of a little mini mall, especially with such yummy options! I'm serious when I say; You NEED to drop by! Luis and his brother started this little wonder with their Mother's recipes that she always used for goodies at their birthday parties, I mean, how cute is that? Its ALL fresh made and DELICIOUS! My hubby got an Oreo Cookie Blizzard and I got a Churro and Ice Cream Combo with my choice of Thrifty Ice Cream! Oh my goodness, SO BOMB!!!!!! The Churro even has caramel inside! Then Luis topped them both with whipped cream and chocolate and caramel drizzle! The Blizzard had a healthy dose of Oreo Cookie chunks too!
Grab your kids, grab your friends and GO! You deserve it!
*Luis also said there will be a patio coming this winter to enjoy your Fair Food ;) ;)

<Time>1613053913419<//Time><rate>4</rate><Text>Its not surprising that the word "fun" can be found in the word funnel cake because everytime I had fun there was a funnel cake there. Normally, to find a funnel cake you either have to go to a  fair,  a  sporting event, or an amusement park. But now, you can get one of these delicious deserts anytime you want.
Located on the corner of 6th and Vineyard in Ontario, is Fairgroundz a modest size sweet shop that sells everything that will make your eyes pop and make your mouth water. If Willy Wonka had a second factory, this would be it. They sell everything from scoops of icecream, to shaved ice, to cookies. But their specialty is the funnel cake, made fresh and cooked to order. The one I had was called the Banana Cream Pie and it was amazing.
Lastly,  this past year was a year unlike any other, a year that none of us will ever forget. It has been like a dark cloud over all of us, but having that funnel cake was like having the sun touch my skin. It was a nice reminder that there was still good/fun things in the world.
Check out Fairgroundz in Ontario.< /Text>< pics>

<Review>Was hanging out with my friend who was in town and we both wanted dessert. Fairgroundz was open late so we stopped by. It was amazing!! Everything you would buy at a Fair, you will find here. They are known for their funnel cakes and the churro funnel cake is my FAVORITE!! I loved that he had the option of lactose whipped cream to top my funnel cake with.  I loved it so much that I ended up hiring them to cater for my wedding coming up March 7th. Can't wait! The strawberry cheesecake funnel cake is also great!</Review><GmapID>0x80c335268cadc493:0xf3fc9f4157a0fb14<//GmapID>< Pictures>

IF YOUR CONCERNED ABOUT COVID 19 DONT come here, the place is packed so tightly that everyone is nearly touching each other and top of that the door is closed, and to add to that no mask wearing rules, I couldn’t even order because it takes so long and your waiting in a room filled with people not wearing a freaking mask!!</review>

< Review>
This is a tiny home in the wall sorry of place. We were craving relief from the heat and stopped in for a snow cone. It was nice that they had a couple of sugar free options but the ice was much coarser than I expected it to be. They also serve ice cream, funnel cakes, and a couple of other deep fried goodies. But the servers, while friendly, were rather slow and they didn't seem to be excited it energetic... Since the theme of the place is food from the fair I was expecting a certain amount of happiness and fun... Probably won't be going back but if you have a craving, you should check it out.<//Review>

I was very excited to see that there was a new location opening near me, as I am a big fan of the original. The menu here is quite a bit smaller and the atmosphere seems rushed and thrown together. The smell of burning oil was so strong that we had to step outside while waiting in line.< /Review>

We were able to make a last minute breakfast reservation on a Sunday and glad we did! The service was attentive, the food was great, and the complimentary coffee cake was well done. I got the Tiki Bowl which I highly recommend! Overall, definitely a breakfast spot worth checking out.</Review>

This was our first stop on our girls weekend in Palm Springs and it was a excellent way to start off our trip. We had fun taking photos in front of the pink building before even getting inside. We sat outside and LOVED the atmosphere. There was a medical emergency with another customer. I felt like the staff acted quickly to help the man. My friend went over to help. They ended up comping her food and drinks. They didn't have to do that but it was definitely appreciated. Right after the incident the whole staff went back to buisness as usual without skipping a beat. We ordered bottomless mimosas and our glass was never empty cause they were always there to fill it back up.< /Text>

<Review>Tropicale is amazing. We go here for happy hour specials and have even been known to show up a couple nights in a row while visiting Palm Springs. We always sit at the outdoor bar. The outside dining area is beautiful. Bartenders are friendly and attentive and turn on my basketball games when I ask. Margaritas are very refreshing.< /Review><resp>None<//resp><username>Elaine Ilmberger< /username><rating>5</rating><pics>None<//pics><Date>1615771916705< /Date></record></dataset><record>

Pretension on grand display.   The guests are fun to watch.  The pretentious host was the best.  No greeting.  Total attitude.  If I had a tampon he might have been friendly (SATC).  Regardless: Great food.  Great space.  Great service< /Text>

The lengths that a restaurant needs to go to in order to protect their diners was accomplished deftly, from the seating to the exit last night. It was delicious as always, with Brandy giving our table impeccable service. The only downside was one of our drinks being rather off from the order but otherwise the experience was the best that we expect from a dining experience at Tropicale!<//Text>

Lovely desert gem! I loved my martini with blue cheese stuffed olives. The outdoor seating is huge and lovely. I didn't care for the cats running around my feet, but I did love the staff. They remembered me from my last visit and that I loved the fire cracker shrimp.</review>

As always, stellar service, and great food in a welcoming and fun environment. Spicy shrimp appetizer was excellent, as  was the fried chicken entree and fried chicken salad. Mile high chocolate cake w/vanilla gelato was ordered to go. Was not impressed with our dessert selection at all and would not order again. Everything else was perfect and very enjoyable.</Text><response>None<//response>< Pictures>

Hey delightful mix of flavor and atmosphere. Definitely a place to stop when you get the time if you're ever in town. I recommend the poo poo platter it's very mild but beware the peanut sauce is a lot hotter than you might imagine.<//review>

We started with the pu pu platter and it didn't disappoint. We tried a few different martinis between the 2 of us and they were all amazing.  The service was attentive and the patio had a chill and casual vibe with great background music.
And, what we discovered upon paying our bill was really cool: there is a small charge ($1.18 in our case; listed at the bottom of the bill) that goes toward helping the restaurant pay for full medical insurance benefits for all the employees! What an amazing idea...We were glad to chip in such a tiny amount to help with such a good cause! Kudos to Tropicale!< /text>< Pics>

The swings is very nice and you will be surrounded by palm trees the the garden, and they have misters in the summer and heat lamps for the winters.  The appetizers and the main dishes were all great.  The portions are huge.  It is a little pricey but the food is all good.<//Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM7jBdkaIViq-YO_BpmK_LBf0-UxD7VhE3ohz4P=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNUPJMgWYjJuMuYMaOnAieMOW5oI3f1Y1jeChKD=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMEXmyHSzMmUljNlFa6AdXBuBRg_bLEkgjjOQrC=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP2SjTChEueuuAUp298DAuEKff1NqyDoH6uJMha=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics><Response>None< /Response>< GmapID>

The restaurant is cute, the outdoor sitting with the birds chirping is very relaxing and good ambience. The food was alright, but our fantastic service were received made up for it.

The onion rings were soggy and too oily, but our server brought us fries which was much better.<//review>

We happened to drive by this place the day before and saw there were people in line, so we had to try this place. Glad we did! Food was delish! Service was friendly. This is what breakfast is all about. the owner came to our table to say hello and see how we were enjoying our breakfast.<//text>

All I can say is wow. I've been coming to Palm Springs for a while now, and this is the first time I've gone here. The service was absolutely amazing and our server, Karissa, was absolutely the best. The food was superb. I can't stress that enough. We ordered a punch bowl drink for the table. Normally when the menu says "serves 4" I'm like ok yeah sure. This was really a huge drink and it tasted amazing. I will definitely come back here for celebrations, and probably just because. Definitely recommend this spot.< /Review>

My experience at Tropicale was devine. We went there for dinner. You must make a reservation! It's a busy and popular restaurant. We got a table by the outdoor bar. It was nuzzled in a corner. The lighting is intimate and comfortable. We had a nice heater above us to keep us nice and warm. We ordered a blueberry mojito and then we ordered another one because it was absolutely delicious! The Salmon we ordered was perfect! It was very tasty, lots of veggies so many flavors!</review>

Beside $15 drinks and $26 pieces of cake, they are now passing the cost their employee's health insurance onto every customer with a separate charge on the bill. Customers already pay the majority of restaurant worker's salaries. Other countries pay their wait staff a living wage. The
U.S. restaurant owners do not. Don't allow this redistribution of wealth. Don't eat here and tell them you will not pay their expenses.</Text>

<Text>I left a review on yelp to which the owner replied with insults, the review is as follows:

They don't enforce mask wearing... While inside waiting for my order their friend walked in without a mask, stood next to me while they continued to chat and say hello to others who work there.... So I ended up just walking outside to put myself at lower risk.
Notice how the owner comes back with insulting me and calling me names. Unprofessional to say the least. Quite childish as well. Oddly enough, to flat out lie and say I wasn't near anyone is absurd. I was standing at the top of the stairs near the entrance, their friend was standing next to me within 6 feet. The owner is more than welcome to provide footage showing otherwise. To justify the events and to lie and say I was far away: well smart one, state mandate says customers are required to wear a mask regardless, even if I'm standing far away which I wasn't. A year into this and you'd think they'd start to understand reality.
Also, I would like to point out the hypocrisy, he says it's people like me that screw things up for everyone... Yet he allows people to enter his business without masks which leads to this pandemic lasting longer than necessary. 😂. Childishly coming after a customer who voiced concerns because I was put in potential danger during a global pandemic? It's no wonder why they were in the news months ago for not following guidelines.<//Text>< userid>

<Review>As a tourist from Seattle, this is my favorite restaurant to visit. The menu is varied and changes constantly. The wait staff is well trained and knowledgeable. This is a "can't miss" restaurant. Perfect for a first date or date with the spouse. My wife had cajun chicken and wanted to order another dinner to take home for leftovers!< /Review>< pictures>

<Text>Amazing food and atmosphere. Indoor and outdoor seating. Great menu with something for everyone. Service was top notch and our waiter was amazing. I can’t wait to go back.
Pictured are the pork chop and a dessert I can’t recall the name. Both amazing!
Great for dates, groups, out of town guests.</Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM8Gs2I_PCphzHaoL5Z2GsDRqaO2heNITkfZSuD=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNiNMRQtPDSfk4svCS91857qUZ7Wy-GzP-Abf8c=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics><Resp>None< /Resp><gmap_id>0x80db1bbb4e3ab7fd:0xa279cb4f4e6b940c</gmap_id></record>

<review>This was our first time there. We didn't know what to expect on the food. We ordered the "Tomahawk" pork chop ( we shared it) and it was THE best pork chop I have ever tasted. OMG, worth the price for sure. Had the peanut butter cake with raspberry jam drizzled over it and that was a pb&j in cake form. It was good. Tried the carrot cake. That was ok (not a fan of carrot cake) but everyone else liked it. Well worth the trip to PS.<//review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

Always a go to while guests are in town. Love sitting on the patio as Our environment allows outside dining virtually daily. Saw some pork chops go out last night that could have fed two people. Amazing presentation. The chocolate cake was one of the best in the desert. This is now a staple for us< /Text>

<text>Good food. The food looks like it came from your good friend's kitchen than a restaurant but still good. The ambiance and the servers here are everything.

I'm giving 3 ⭐ because the tables are too closer to each other. I'm glad everyone was wearing a mask but this is a good place, they can easily space out the tables in the outdoor garden area.

If you do go here just make sure to go to a corner so less foot traffic.<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmapID>

I’ve lived on this planet for 51 years, and this was literally the best service I have ever had. Came here for my anniversary and we were absolutely blown away by the level of service, the friendliness, the intimacy and romantic feeling of the bar and eating area, and the food was exceptional. I don’t say this lightly. I’m quite spoiled when it comes to service and food and this was amazing. Book it now!<//text>

This is a go to spot for me and my girlfriend whenever we come to Palm Springs. The atmosphere is lively, the service is attentive, and the food is memorable. There are lots of options depending on how hungry you are. When we're not super hungry, we stick to the (not so) small plates. We recently got the firecracker shrimp and the blue crab with sushi rice. The shrimp was perfectly sauced and not overly spicy, and the blue crab was refreshing and filling.<//Text>

<review>Here for our quarterly visit to P.S. and dinner at Trooicale....  as always, spectacular!  Beyond expectation!  Service is always outstanding and the food so delicious.     I recommend the Tomahawk Pork Chop...  always delicious... I think we always get one of every appetizer for our regular group of 10 and they are superb.
Battle of the desserts this time and I think it was a tie between bourbon cake and pumpkin bread pudding.....   ummmm. Love you guys.. thank you<//review><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None<//resp><gmap_id>0x80db1bbb4e3ab7fd:0xa279cb4f4e6b940c<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Simply amazing food every time I go here, went for breakfast had the chicken sausage Benedict was fantastic, went for dinner had the ramen and it was just mind-blowing. Be warned the chicken sausage is a little spicy but tolerable.the ramen is just incredible the noodles are done to perfection with just the right amount of chewy to them, if you've had ramen noodles or udon you know what I'm talking about.<//Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMY0_ESoxsXKfXuAziLjcgPJ6iIWCfZn7Z3V3e2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNXd9UHFGV8pX7WFeOwCvC2o3GFVeRcneHt26HW=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics>< resp>

Absolutely wonderful experience. This restaurant knows the meaning of service. From start to finish, everything was seamless and left little to be desired. Our Ukrainian waitress was phenomenal though... watching a true professional at work was great. From the time she took to get your order right without writing it down immediately, to passing by to check on you without necessary always stopping at the table, to the careful way with which she patiently poured beers into a glass, and all with a smile and pleasant demeanor...I would visit again with a doubt. That said, the food was also great but the fantastic carrot cake did it for me! It was the perfect blend of carrot and cheese cake perfection 😊< /text>

Aside from being greeted by a bearded host who refused to wear a mask (it was hanging from his ear) it was a good experience. But this almost made us turn around at the door. Bartenders were also preparing drinks maskless. Makes one wonder about what's going on in the kitchen. Spacing between tables was way too close. On top of one another.  It's my opinion, restaurants not following these basic safety rules, during this period (brand new all time high in US cases today! 80K) should be immediately closed. While it would be a shame, so would a dinner becoming a super spreading event, leading to multiple illnesses and death.

Having said that. Our waitress was lovely, attentive, and always near.  Her recommendation of the Blood Orange Martini was terrific. The fried calamari is pretty close to perfect. Fresh, crispy, but just a light batter.

Fried Chicken entree ($28) is as good as it gets in a restaurant like this, out here in Palm Springs. The Pork Chop ($42) was moist and not dried out. Served with a nice salad.

Fix the mask issues and this place is a winner.<//Text>

While on our first trip to Palm Springs, a place well known for its overwhelming amount of culinary options... we chose The Tropicale, which was recommended to us. We’re so glad we did! The dining room is beautiful in all its 1970s feel. The food was RIDICULOUS!

My son (this place is child friendly, though there aren’t kids menus) had the prosciutto and Brie pizza and it was GLORIOUS!  My wife had the burger which had Brie, caramelized onions and truffle mayo which she loved. I had their boneless fried chicken which I wouldn’t normally get but it was one of their specialties, and I SO glad I did! It was KILLER! We ended up spending a bit more than we would have liked, but this is the type of meal where you leave feeling like you stretched every penny despite the cost with no regret. Totally worth it.

The staff is super friendly too. Our waiter was great, but the busing team was fantastic too! They were like an army, always coming by, but never too much... they seemed to anticipate every tine they were needed to bring refills, take plates away or what have you. They were great.

I would make this a must on your next Palm Springs trip!<//review>

<Review>Fun and Hip atmosphere, awesome handmade cocktails, and excellent food. We really enjoyed our dinner at the Tropicale in Palm Springs. Even though we had to wait for our table it was totally worth it. We went to their bar and watched their very busy bartenders hand make our drinks. We chose from their excellent selection of fun, and artfully created cocktails. For dinner, the four of us shared some of their wonderful and Light flatbread pizzas, roasted asparagus and some of their fun and eclectic appetizers. Be sure to go there hungry and ready for an interesting, upbeat, and entertaining dinner. Maybe if you're lucky, you might even be able to spot Barry Manilow having dinner.!< /Review><username>Mary Biancalana</username>< GmapID>

So Good!!!!

Our first time in Palm Springs. So glad we tried this place. Fantastic Value. Great drinks. Very large portions. Friendly, and helpful service from all servers, especially Yasmine and Alexandria.

Poke was delicious. Fried Chicken SO good.

Would definitely return again.< /text>

Incredibly cool atmosphere, my wife and I sat outside in January under a lovely heater. We had the margarita and coconut martini both of which were fantastic, the martini was one of the best I’ve ever had. The calamari appetizer was wonderful. The service was exceptional! The brisket burger was not very good, the chicken fried steak was slightly above average. I recommend going here for drink and appetizers both were fantastic!</Text>

This place was fabulous. We got there early 3:50 and got the second to last happy hr table. It’s opens at 4:00. There was a private party that day but u want to be early if u want the happy hr, menu and prices.

The food was really very good, staff was attentive. We were there about and hr and the place was packed when we left. They was live music inside with a lovely atmosphere.  It sure looks like the place to be.

One of the many dishes was the bacon wrapped cheese in a plum. I am getting excited just thinking about it now. Yummers🥰< /text>

We were visiting from Canada and really enjoyed our dinner here seated out on the patio. A bit noisy for some but it had a great friendly atmosphere and vibe. My Steelhead Lock Salmon was excellent. Great service. Definately recommended.< /review>

< Review>
The outside seating area is excellent. The staff is like a well choreographed  ballet as they whizz around working. The margheritas and the Cobb salad were hearty and and tasty. The marinara sauce and meatballs left me wondering if there had been a theft of spices from the kitchen.</Review>

<review>Food was excellent 👌
Staff was wearing masks 👍

Only complaint would be that other patrons would walk in the building without a mask!  The restaurant should have an employee out front preventing this behavior.

Will definitely return on my next trip to Palm Springs 😁<//review><Gmap_id>0x80db1bbb4e3ab7fd:0xa279cb4f4e6b940c< /Gmap_id><UserId.>113023485763528950040< /UserId.>< Pics>

Got the fried chicken and wish I would have got something else. The greens were equally blah.

Swordfish was great, burger great salad great. Service beyond great. Got 4 stars because of the great service. Must have got the bad night of chicken.</review>

<review>Normally love this place !NOT HAPPY with them today. Manager didn't handle a noisy table as promised after several people moved and we asked him to please ask them to be a little quieter. He asked if we would like to move? No. We aren't the problem.  Obviously no one else wanted to sit by them.

Great food and service but only giving 2 stars for those two things. Their COVID-19 precautions are basically non existent. Servers are wearing masks and there’s hand sanitizer at the front but that’s about it. The tables are way to close to one another (as I’m posting this, I’ve noticed other reviews also mentioned this). There was a party of 30+ people sitting next to our 2 seater table. They were drunk and having a good time but none of them were wearing mask and only about half of them were sitting in their seats at any given time. When not in their seats, they were filling the isles between all the surrounding tables, including ours. Other tables who also had the unfortunate luck of being seated next to them also looked uncomfortable with the situation.

It’s disappointing that Tropicale is still booking reservations this large in the middle of a pandemic in a county that has so many positive cases.

I am writing this 3 days after I went and Riverside county has now shut down indoor dining. That party could’ve been a super spreader event happening right before of us.

I hope Tropicale actually reads this and reconsiders their approach to a safe dining experience in the midst of a pandemic.</Review>

My boyfriends never been to Palm Springs before and The Tropicale seemed to perfectly capture what Palm Springs is all about. The food was literally TO DIE FOR. We ordered the fried chicken, brie burger, and tempura prawns. EVERY 👏🏻 SINGLE 👏🏻 PLATE 👏🏻 was to die for. And Aaron our waiter, was great!</text>

Carissa provided wonderful service and is just simply lovely and likable, and all service personnel performed with the highest caliber.  Really just loved the Tropicale all the way around.

Sophisticated decor outside alludes to the promise of luxurious surroundings inside.

Clearly a memorable dining experience offering silky drinks, full-flavored food, top-shelf service.

The exquisite atmosphere fuses sultry tropical sensuality with a smooth, southern California  vibe.</Text>

A Limited Entre Menu.
$25 for a Brisket Hamburger seems a BIT high..
$117 for 2.
2 Brisket Burgers, Calamari Appetizer,  2 glasses of Wine and 1 Margarita.
Then a Charge to Pay for the Waiters Health Insurance?? OUCH
A Bit Expensive,  but its the First time we have been to a Restaurant in 7 months due to Covid..< /review>

My favorite happy hour on a patio.Evening scene is just as much fun as the happy hour scene. Indoor and outdoor bars mix up great cosmos, misters and fans keep it cool on the patio, or nicely air conditioned inside. Great happy hour specials like truffle fries and pizzas, and fun music.<//Review>

Drinks were fabulous, food wonderful and portions were large; couldn't get through all 3 portions of fried chicken on my plate!   The collard greens were so tasty.  Appetizers great for sharing.  Service impeccable and the atmosphere was lively yet intimate. Will definitely go back next time I am in the area.<//Review>

Step back in time to the mid-century modern era. Fantastic vibe with a lot going on. I had the largest and prettiest white sangria I have ever seen. We were a party of two and decided to do small plates. The Pu Pu platter was outstanding. The satay, beef skewers and ribs were exquisitely tender and seasoned perfectly. The shrimp were crispy and delucious. I personally didn't like the spring roll as I found the wrapper gelatinous and would have preferred a crunchy one. The Goat cheese and beet salad was excellent but it would have been better had the beets been roasted. The avocado goat cheese and tomato flatbread was also delicious but we had to take most of it home because the food was so plentiful. Would highly recommend going here.</Text>

Such amazing food and great atmosphere! Outside seating is great,  the inside looks awesome but have never sat inside. The fried chicken is a must order. They also have great and creative cocktails! Tropicale is in our regular rotation of priority places to eat in Palm Springs. You must go away least once.<//text>

<Review>This one of a kind place has the most unique and tasty food and the best drinks in Palm Springs. A very diverse cliental that is representative of Palm Springs a great Village style town in the Desert. The entertainment on Tuesdays and Thursdays with the Derrik Lewis Duo and Trio is like no other in town playing the "Great American Songbook". Very Upscale with the most friendly wait staff and delightful hands on owners Tony and Ranz.</Review>< Pics>

This place is amazing. Go there during happy hour. The drinks are good and they don’t skim on alcohol. Our server Irving was super nice! He suggested good drinks and had great conversation. We ordered small plates during happy hour and made that a midday lunch. The fried calamari were pretty good, the truffle fries are just amazing. Honestly, we’re leaving tomorrow but if we could stay we’d definitely come back.< /Review>

< Review>
Went here on 7/2PM. Crab wedge salad was great, & so was the pepperoni pizza. The bill for 2 salads, the pizza & 5 drinks (martinis and Budlight bottles) was $210. Bartender was super nice and on top of it with food and drinks. Staff was in masks, but tables & bar stools were not spread apart- it was absolutely packed. I understand businesses and people need to make $, but with COVID19 going on the bar stools should be spread apart as well as the tables. Health & safety should be the top priority. Also TONY D’s (an owner or manager) reply to STEVE H’s review was absolutely horrible. No one should speak that way to a paying customer- especially a manager or owner.</Review>

I thought i was the only one who thought it was odd that masks were not being worn on all staff.
Then i came across this post.
I love the food here, but won't be back until safety for the staff and patrons is top priority< /review>

<review>I don't give out many 5 Star reviews... But this place is definitely worth it. Great decor, great service, amazing food! Had the Pupu Platter, different kinds of meat skewers, fried shrimp and some spring rolls... It was all amazing! So unusual to find good asian style food in a restaurant like this!  It's a definite must go on a trip to PSP....< /review>< pics>

Fun  campy surroundings. Party atmosphere. Staff is wonderful. Food is fabulous, I had to bring half of my fried chicken home. I love fried chicken and this was one if the best.  The sound level.can get explosive but it was all part of the experience.</Review>

Always wonderful for a festive group dinner. Great drinks/wine, good portions & friendly staff. Off the main street so much less touristy. This has been a fun spot for awhile now and it's still going strong.</Text>

<Text>We recently dined at this restaurant making it my first restaurant experience since Covic19 as it's a favorite place for my friends and I to dine at.  The staff was so friendly and service was great.  All employees but one wore a mask including ownership.  I would say 50% of the people coming into the restaurant didn't wear a mask and as they got up to go to the restrooms wouldn't wear them.  I felt the tables inside the restaurant were spaced out well but the patio and bar needed further attention.  I brought these things up to one of the owners who said he would take it up under consideration.  I guess he didn't because friends dined there this week and had the same experience.  How disappointing.< /Text>< response>

This place is perfectly positioned in Palm Springs! It's got a Miami-like atmosphere and bright colors and energetic staff and guests. The drinks were plenty and the food delicious!</Text>

Lorrie is a standout among the standouts... she really makes me feel extra special... whether you sit outside on the wonderful patio, inside at the bar or inside in the intimate tables, Tropicale will exceed your expectations< /Review>< Pics>

We celebrated my mothers 83rd birthday here last night and it was wonderful. Jean Marque was our server and he was bryond excellent. My mother was thrilled with the entire experience and my partner and I are now convinced that Tropicale is the best fine dining restaurant in Palm Springs. Love this place!</review>

This place is super fun!

We ate here recently with our neighbors. The outdoor patio is lively and loud during happy hour but settles down at dinner.

The menu is interesting and the food was excellent. The specialty is the fried chicken. Yes, fried chicken. You will not be disappointed!

This is a great place for a night out with friends.< /Text>

This was a fun place with a very Palm Springs vibe. The menu is eclectic and varied so you can totally satisfy a lot of cravings and preferences for a big group. Cocktails are very sugary so beware if you’re sensitive to that haha</Text>

Great Happy Hour menu.  The interior has that retro cocktail feel with neon pink lights and dimly lit corners. The outdoor dining area is cute and sunny— great for some wine and apps. We had the molé nachos, which were delicious.<//review>

This place by no means is “fine dining.” The food is just fair, everything seemed rushed, as they sought to seat new guests at our table, probably won’t go back.<//text>

We ate here with a group of 7. Our waitress was really nice, we had a reservation and the host sat us immediately at an outdoor table. I appreciated the fans & misters, but the two sitting closest to the misters were visibly wet the entire meal. Especially the person sitting by the palm trees, the water was actually accumulating on the palm tree & soaking directly into her hair. We asked the waitress to turn the misters off, she said it would get too hot and they were all on one system instead of individual systems. It was around 80 degrees, so we would have been fine with just fans & not the misters, but it wasn't an option. Later in the evening, we asked a manager to turn off 1 fan which he happily did. So still wet, but not blowing air on us (by now it was dark and the fans weren't needed).

We got the large drink to share with the group, that was festive & super fun. Everyone liked their food and our waitress was very funny & the service was very quick.

I'm sure if we sat at any other table in the restaurant, I would have given 5 stars.< /text>

Our server had no clue how to serve tables, she left us sitting 40 minutes with menus on the table. We had to hunt her down to order. We sat on the patio and it was chaotic and uncomfortable. I had 3 staff bump into the back of us, startling us each time. Management should provide better training to staff on how to provide service. We were embarrassed taking our house guests to Tropicale.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None< /resp><Gmap_id>0x80db1bbb4e3ab7fd:0xa279cb4f4e6b940c< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

The cocktails were great, the service was mostly great, the food was meh! and overpriced.
Told it'd be 20 minutes for seats for dinner, I went to the host after 40 minutes, got seated 10 minutes later with apologies. That was nice. Waited in the bar area, the drinks were fantastic.
Menu was underwhelming. How can you screw up collard greens? Steak was cooked as ordered, but not the quality cut I expected.
If you want to visit a landmark, great.  It is a hopping place.<//review>

One the plus side, the food was great.  My wife's meal and my meal were exactly what we had wanted and were of good quality. Our neighboring table was doing and eyeing about their food and going on and on about how excellent their meals were so I knew it wasn't just us. On the minus side I'm not so sure that the ceiling is as clean as it needs to be but it's hard to tell because it was so dark that it was difficult to see what was who was not OK. Maybe I've watched one too many episodes of Restaurant Impossible?< /Text>

<review>We sat on the patio and that was nice. I ordered a ceaser salad and the classic spaghetti with clam sauce. The dish had egg noodles that were mushy and the sauce was bland and just not what I was expecting from "classic spaghetti". Others in our party said their food was good, but most just said it was ok. I think it is very expensive for the quality.</review></record></dataset><record>

Really great vibe to the place. Unfortunately that was the best part. Food was mediocre at best. We had the steelhead with ginger soy dressing and black rice and it tasted just like simply steamed vegetables. Wine selection was limited to grocery store vintages. And the menus and place settings smelled stale. Like someone had used a dish rag that had gone sour on them. Service was fine. Not amazing, not attrocious. Overall unmemorable, but very nice interior decor.< /Text>

The staff was friendly prompt and attentive.  Our waiter was friendly helpful and even gave us some tips about our first summer in Palm Springs.  We can't wait to go back for dinner.
I ordered the traditional eggs benedict.  The eggs were poached perfectly.  And it was served on a full size ham steak!  Which was also prepared perfectly.  The whole experience is top notch.< /review>< Pictures>

<resp>None<//resp><Text>the service was outstanding. I had the fried chicken with the mashed potatoes with corn in it and accompanying kale as a side dish. I personally did not care for the kale whatsoever! The Fried Chicken was okay but a little bit Bland by my Southern standards. the mashed potatoes were excellent. The calamari was excellent as were the shrimp. I wish they had not taken away the bread dishes when they brought the second basket of bread I had no place to put the vinegar and olive oil.</Text>< UserId.>

<text>Such a fun place!  Our server was really wonderful.  Gave us excellent drink and food recommendations, and didn't rush us at all.  We sat on the patio at about 7 pm... It was a warm day, but the misters and fans do the trick to keep you comfortable.  The menu is extensive, and covers several types of food... I would expect just about anyone will be able to find something that they are sure to enjoy.< /text>< userid>

I don’t think the food was good at all, everything I had was way too salty and the service was terrible. This is definitely a place for locals and if you are not a local you will be ignored by the servers< /Review>

This is a wonderful step back in time to the 50s but clean and current. Great staff, good menu. Strong cocktails and good happy hour from 4 to 7. One of our favorite Palm Springs dinners. Worth it!</Review>

What a great place! The staff, from hostess, waitress,  water guy and table buser were all great. Food great, and the decor is really impressive.  Apparently we aren't the only ones who realize this is a great place. It was standing room only!< /Review>

The pizza was under-cooked and was not a Hawaiian Pizza as ordered. The spaghetti was under-cooked as well with not enough sauce. The meatballs were okay. The appetizers of satay chicken was good but the peanut sauce was over spiced. The hummus and lamb meatball we're good. The salad with shrimp was also very good. The lighting was too low but was brought up a bit during dinner so others must have made comment.

A special thank you to the server who helped this disabled vet get out of the very low chairs along with my partner was appreciated and cause no attention to my issue. Thank you.< /Text><user_id>117630716867526747331< /user_id></record></dataset><record>

However, the food was just a little about average.  The food came out so fast I think they have quite a bit prepared in advance. The food was not as delicious or high end as the price point was.< /review>< Rating>

<Review>It's a nice sit down restaurant with a bar. Dimly lit on a Saturday night. I can see people of all ages. I got a vodka red bull, and the Bartender was nice. I'm not sure why it doesn't have any other reviews. It's been open for around 10 years. Food looks good.</Review>< pictures>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Text>I enjoy this place very much. It has a beautiful outside patio area and Bar in addition to the inside Bar and Restaurant. Drinks are good and the happy hour menu is reasonable and very tasty. The servers are very pleasant. Recently had Sunday brunch there with friends and I enjoyed my frittata and Bloody Mary a great deal. It tends to  get  quite busy quickly  and as the weather grows  warmer  the outside  bar and Patio seating area will become even more popular.  Get there early or  be prepared to  stand at one of the stand up  areas. Give it a try I recommend it.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

<review>Very big portions, leftovers are usually packed in bags. The food was simple, yet not so tasteful. Prices were a little bit too high compared to the taste. Service was efficient, even though they messed up our order first. The general mood in the restaurant was very tropical and classy. I liked how everything was organic in the restaurant.</review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None</response>< Gmap_id>

<review>The decor is retro chic aka mid century modern with an updated feeling of being seen in the right place at the right time.  Many people dine in groups here, as did we, to celebrate a significant birthday party on the outside tropical-themed patio.  Our server was excellent and brought our generous cocktails immediately.  Unfortunately, I ordered the wrong entree, but she replaced it  with my new palette-pleasing choice rather quickly, and did not charge me for my mistake.  You get the feeling the staff wants you to have the best time possible and they work in sync to make a great impression on you so you keep coming back.  Excellent service, fabulous drinks and cuisine, and you dine in a lighthearted stylish ambience.</review>< Pictures>

<review>Want to feel slightly Sinatra?  Enjoy the high backed booths & CA fusion menu.  Great bar w good bartenders. Live music some nights.  Outdoor patio too. Not cheap, but worth the money.  Save room for dessert.  Reservations highly recommended, even in off season.  They have a nightclub too across street.</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Date>

It’s has a wonderful atmosphere inside as well as on their spacious patio— a very old Hollywood feel. Every time I’m here it feels like a special occasion.

Very disappointing meal last night. Brought a friend from out of town. The  atmosphere was great, but otherwise not worth the $200 price for two. Service was surprisingly bad, waitress was timid, shy and uninformed. Jalapeño pineapple margaritas had no spice whatsoever and were rather flavorless. Entrees arrived while we were still eating out apps. Filet mignon was nothing special. Menu filled with random classic dishes, but everything we had was just meh. Wanted a cappuccino for dessert, but only coffee available. Waitress presented incorrect check amount.</Text>

Went for lunch with good friends. We were very impressed with the venue and the service. The lunch menu was reasonably priced and the food satisfactory. Clearly the Tropicale is more of a night spot as they have a full calendar of local entertainment. Would definitely return some evening.</text>

<review>Went for Happy Hour. We had Meatballs, Truffle Fries and Kobe Sliders and some Happy Hour drinks. Delis although we would skip the Truffle fries next time, not because they aren't good, they are terrific but overpriced. Service from Jeffrey was excellent!< /review><userid>100868576262262313231< /userid></record></dataset><record>

I have been coming here for years and have always said that this is the best place in town. However, I never thought that that the management would be so careless and pretty much gave us an F u when we complained about RAW chicken. They made us paid for a meal which was not eaten and well totally undercooked. No ma'm I will not mess with salmonella tonight, thanks though!!!!!  I'm sad and heartbroken because I will never come here again. I will not support a business who is so careless about food handling and putting any of their guest through that.</Text>

<Name>Jay Anderson<//Name><Review>Outstanding outdoor dining and patio bar.  This is where the locals congregate over Happy Hour drinks and grub.  An air conditioned inside bar and dining room is also available for those non-outdoorsy patrons.  The service is friendly, the drinks are good and the food is delicious.  Give it a try -- you won't be disappointed.< /Review>< UserId.>

With so many five star reviews to this place you might think "The Tropicale" is a Michelin rated restaurant?

We'll ... This Dade County reminiscent gin joint is far from it, but they try really hard in more ways than two.

Their service is in your face attentive and cheery from the eye candy in the front to the wait staff buzzing around. Weekend nights are simply a happening place to be here too.

The menu here is quite long and a bit over the top. It matches the decor quite apropos in a non sparingly manner too. The pizza is made heavy with lots of dough and lots of cheese. The Poopoo platter seems like a good value, but the chicken and beef skewers are tougher than Management's response to customer concerns and comments.

The only thing going for the many visits from folks are the drinks. The alcohol really flows strong in this joint. Cocktails are large and with big personalities. I can certainly imagine folks here writing their reviews immediately after getting hammered.

If you're looking for value or a near Michelin star meal, you will have to look elsewhere. If what you seek is a happening time, with some people watching and a stiff drink - The Tropicale is your place. Just don't confuse the line next door at the bumping club where the window glass is about to shake loose from the bass.</review>

We had long standing reservations for 8 pm with out of town guests... we were not seated until 9:10; rude staff and not accommodating. No apologies other than 3 large bachelorette parties apparently were given our table. We were 4; they, the batchlorettes,  were many more in number, Thus a bigger bill and more
Money for Tropicale. After finally being seated, we ordered. Well the pasta was terrible... 3 guests left the food... my salmon
Was tasteless and I almost cracked a tooth on the undercooked black rice! This visit was an embarrassment and total disaster...compounded by the management’s arrogance and poor attitude. We won’t be back! If this is how lgbtq people are treated,  by our own, we will take our business elsewhere. There are plenty of other venues with better good and more helpful Management !<//Review>

A hidden gem! Fun atmosphere, great vibe and amazing service. Friendly and warm. Menu is diverse with lots of options for everyone. Loved the tuna roll and pork chop. Deserts are big portions...perfect for sharing. A must visit in Palm Springs!!!! And the peanut butter martini....to die for!< /text>

A great vibe, always busy. Friendly, confident,  knowledgeable staff.  Dine inside or out. Menu leans toward comfort food. Nightly specials allow chefs the chance to stretch.  The seafood stew was fresh and perfectly prepared. You'll need reservations. Highly recommend.</Review>

We are regular customers. The Happy Hour Menu is probably the largest and best we've ever seen. The bartenders are so friendly. Especially Chris, Fernando and Tito. This is a very popular place so dinner reservations are necessary. Food is a little pricey. They have a huge outdoor patio. Better in cooler weather.  Don't miss this place.< /review>

<Text>Festive but not overly noisy! The ambiance was quite nice and the server was very enthusiastic...however the food quality did not match what the server was saying - the food was fairly decent for my taste but I would not imagine that it is the "top 100 restaurants in the world" like the server stated! It's definitely worth checking out!< /Text>< Gmap_id>

The food is ok-to-good, not great. Service was very good, not excellent, but very good!  Prices are way too high for the products served. Drinks are strong, but then expensive, so it's a wash. This was our 4th visit over several years, and the same each time.  The pupu platter is decent. The southern fried chicken salad is meh. The brisket burger with brie was ordered medium as the kitchen recommends, but came out well. There's supposed to be truffle in there too but tasted like a truffle was only waved over it. Popular with the "in" crowd, so if you care more about being seen...</review>

<Text>The filet was good but the mac and cheese was missing something taste wise and the crust was a bit hard and deep. Also button mushrooms were sliced up and sparse mixed in the spinach. Good atmosphere as usual but just something lacking tonight. Still recommend as a place to check out at least once in PS.<//Text>< Pics>

Incredible atmosphere, wonderful food. On the pricey side, but definitely worth it. I would definitely recommend dining on their patio (unless it's over 100°F out and you can't tolerate that kind of heat). The beautiful trees, lighting and music create a very warm and romantic atmosphere. Great selection of drinks/cocktails, and food, from a sushi menu to deliciously moist and crispy (but not greasy) fried chicken salad, and a perfectly cooked and very tasty skirt steak served with pickled jicama and beets. Everything is made  with much thought. The warm cookie selection for dessert is great! Wonderful restaurant for a romantic dinner or any  celebration.<//text>

Tropicale is a local favorite, nice brunch on the weekends although it would be exciting if they switched up some of their brunch menu and offered new items. Great patio, swanky interior.<//Text>

My galpals and I went to this place for a bachelorette party dinner and had a great time! Cocktails were very tasty, and food seemed fresh. We did think the prices were a little expensive for what you received (only three shrimp on the salad), but overall very pleasant time! Sushi was two thumbs up.</Text>

I enjoyed my time here so much, I contemplated going back during the same trip! Great decor, sat outside under heat lamps near a small fountain. The coconut martini is definitely worth it, similar taste to a pina colada. The pork chop was delicious as well. Lovely ambiance and great food, will return!<//Review>

Amazing. Simply amazing! I went there on my own as I'm visiting Palm Springs solo but Sean, the manager, and everyone else were so friendly and attentive that it made me feel like I was with a group of friends. Take my advice, just ask Sean for suggestions. He had tons and they were all delicious! Their banh mi was the best sandwich I've ever had; hands down!
I cannot wait to return to this beautiful restaurant. Thank you Tropicale!</Text>

Rushed service.  Did small plates which we're fine, but each had pickled vegetables with it.  The patio was pleasant.  Won't rush back but won't avoid it, either.</Text>

< review>
When I visit my girlfriends in Palm Springs we always go here for brunch or happy hour. They have the best brunches, you just can't go wrong. Their food isn't like a Marie Callender's with standard Americanized food. They have more specialty-type food. I love the salads and my girlfriends all the love the cheeseburgers, they are the best around. They have a nice, big bar inside, but we like the outside seating. It's awesome, especially at night. They have lighted trees and the nicest, most comfy patio furniture couches with fire pits. The wait staff is super friendly and always chatting us up. It's fine dining with a casual atmosphere.</review>

The service was very good. I didn't have a reservation and I was seated at a table top in the bar area near the reception area. A group of very rude men stood next to my table encroaching on my space waiting for a table with no concern for me eating my meal. I was hoping that someone at the restaurant would have told them to move away from my table. They didn't. I decided to leave. I did think the food was good.< /Review>< pictures>

Great vibe and staff are always helpful. One of my fave places for happy hour. The gorgonzola stuffed dry plums in crispy bacon are excellent, as well as the fish tacos. Great place for cocktails or dinner out on the patio.<//Text>

Fabulous interior and ambience. We had an excellent server. Took a long time for our food to arrive, but we didn't care much. Food was delicious and portions were huge. All 8 of us took home doggie bags. Loved the live music.<//review>

Eat outside if possible. Small plates are very good with an Asian flair and service is competent considering the number of people in the place.</Review>< Pics>

$78.00 for two margaritas more like strawberry lemonade, a disgusting hamburger and fried chicken that tastes like it was brought in from McDonald's.  The food was distinctly white trash.  Mildred Pierce would have vomited at the exit. Horrible food.  I am going to call the Riverside County Health Department on this dive.< /review>

Very nice place a little dark from dinner but food was very tasteful. Hawaiian pizza was delicious and really one of the best pizzas I tried flavorful, simply great. Tables are a little small but we had a great dinner experience. First time in Palm Springs and this place is a must try. Prices are good as well.</text>

<review>HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE.  WILL NOT RETURN.  LISTEN TO THE LOCALS.  I LIVE IN PALM SPRINGS.  I'm a regular who had reservations tonight for a specific booth at 7:00 pm.  I was promised a specific booth.  When I arrived at 6:30, I checked in with the host. I was told the table was ready and I said that I wanted to find my guest in the bar and I would return before 7:00 to be seated.  The host was very cordial.  Upon my return just before 7:00, there was a hostess ( a very rude woman) who informed me that my reservation would not be honored for the specific table I had requested (and reserved three days earlier), because they wanted to seat larger parties at the table, and since I was a party of two, my reservation would not be honored.  She further told me that no table was guaranteed, even though she had not made the reservation, or promise of a specific table.  I was told that a table would be available soon, but not the one I had reserved.  I said that that was unprofessional, that I had made a reservation, stated the number of guests, requested my usual table, and was promised it.  I was told by this rude woman that she would not honor my reservation, even though the table had been reserved for me and my guest, she had already seated a larger party at the table.  She was not even apologetic.  She was NASTY!!!  She was ARROGANT!!!  Three weeks earlier I had this table with three guests, and spent over $400.  While the food is not that exceptional at this restaurant, the service had always been good in my experience.  This woman was horrible!!! No manners!  No class!!  She should be fired, and would never work for me.  No honor for what had been reserved.  And, rude!!!  Just for the record, this was Friday, July 21st, 7:00, and reservations are not honored at this establishment.  Not only will I never eat there again, but I will tell everyone I know what a horrible experience I had at Tropicale.  STAY AWAY!!  THERE ARE MANY BETTER PLACES TO EAT IN PALM SPRINGS, THAT HONOR RESERVATIONS!!!!<//review></record>

Went with a party of 7 for brunch. The standout at our table was the Crispy Southern Fried Chicken on a Bacon Jalapeño Waffle. Add that to the complimentary coffee cake and the $12 bottomless prosecco, this was a great experience that was enjoyed by all.<//Text>

Classic supper club with a pomo sensibility: a little palm tree - coconut - tropical; a little naugahyde banquette - indirect lighting - Hollywood. Did I mention the wall-mounted marlin? Very nice menu, including a range of interesting craft cocktails. Our plates were excellent.</review>

<Text>Drinks were decently priced and the food was healthy and good. My friend had her wedding here, and everything on the menu was delicious. The outdoor patio area was cute, and there were two bars (one indoors and one outdoors). We sat in the patio. It was perfect for a warm Palm Springs evening.<//Text><rate>4< /rate>< response>

A happening scene with great food
Tropicale is one of our favorite places in Palm Springs. The friendly, helpful staff always steers us right when it comes to food suggestions. And if it's your first time, you'll definitely need their recommendations because there are a wide variety of things to try.
If you do the "small plates", keep in mind that these are not small! We always forget and order several and end up with far more food than we expect. You'll probably want to have an entree as your main portion because many of the small plates are fried and you don't want to miss out on the excellent entrees. Just remember to bring your appetite!< /review>

The Tropicale had a fun vibe and ambiance, but the service was only okay. The food and drinks ranged from mediocre to disappointing. That being said, I only ordered one drink and tasted a friend's, so perhaps other cocktails are better. The pours were generous, but that didn't improve my opinion because the flavor of one of their "most popular" cocktails was gross; it did not taste of lemongrass at all with a hint of basil, but mostly cheap/not-tasty vodka. I had a good time, but I don't think I would return and certainly not for dinner.<//Text>

<text>The food was divine, and the cocktails are fun and inventive. I subbed out the mango in the spicy mango mojito for pineapple and it was delicious. The wait staff was super knowledgeable about the menu and made great recommendations. There was a noisy bachelorette party, but I found it oddly comforting that the staff was just as annoyed by it as the patrons. Which is to say, you should still come enjoy the food and drinks but maybe don't scream and yell every ten minutes. This wasn't that kind of place.< /text>< GmapID>

Dark, dull, dated and disappointing. These sum up my experience at the infamous Tropicale.

The service was attentive and quick overall, but the food is very sub-par. Of our party of 4, no one finished
their plate entirely and wouldn't attempt the dessert.

The decor. Oh the decor. It was absolutely hideous. I get some places choose to stay with the true essence of an establishment, but a little updating helps. If you want a restaurant straight of the 1970's, this is the place for you!</Review>

My favorite upscale place for happy hour. Drinks are delish, food is incredible, and the staff is super friendly and helpful. The outside bar is especially fun, but inside there is a terrific trio playing background music. You'll like it there.</text>

A friend took us here for dinner, as he is a regular and thought we would appreciate it. Well, we loved the decor plus it was live Jazz night and we
were seated in a booth that was just far enough away so that we could hear the jazz and still converse.
Kamden was our server and did a fabulous job of recommending menu items and pacing our meal. He said they were known for their Fried Chicken.....so I decided to take him up on it. Deb had the Diablo Shrimp Caesar and Tony the "Everything Pizza". They both ordered Martini's which came in LARGE Martini glasses and I went with the Hop Nosh IPA. Hand on heart, this was probably the best Fried Chicken (Boneless yet!), that I've ever eaten. 3 large breast portions on home made mashed potatoes, perfectly cooked greens on the side and a tasty gravy. I give Tropicale 10 out of 10 for Bread and Circuses.<//Text></record>

<text>The happy hour martinis were large, potent and well worth the visit. Unfortunately dinner was not. There are too many excellent restaurants within walking distance to settle for the Tropicales mediocre food. The fried chicken was not crunchy, covered in sauce and tasted old. The kabob was chewy and flavorless. The accompanying veggies on both meals however, were surprisingly quite good. We gave our doggy bags to a homeless man up the street.< /text></record>

<rating>5< /rating><Text>Outstanding! If you are visiting the Palm Springs area, put this place on your list. The kitschy Cabana decor belies the excellent food and service. I had the filet mignon on arugula salad and it was cooked to perfection, lightly touched with truffle oil and delicious. My date had the fried chicken, which was also quite good. We finished with one of the best carrot cakes we've ever tastes. Our server was attentive without being ever present and the support staff on the floor who ran food and filled water were also efficient and pleasant. Highly, highly recommended!<//Text>< Pictures>

Ambiance was great, food was good. My friend had the boneless southern fried chicken, which he loved, though I thought it was a little overcooked and the crust was soggy. I had a Thai inspired beef salad, which was good, but could have used more than fish sauce and peanuts for Thai flavor, some lemongrass, birds eye chile and makrud lime leaf would have made it excellent.</text>

Always has been one of my favorite restaurants in the desert but for some reason tonight...not so much! Raw pizza, raw meatloaf and the service was just ok. So disappointed!
Just hoping this does not happen again...get it together in the kitchen boys!</Review>

Love The Tropicale, the food is amazing and it is always crowded even in the summer, the atmosphere is fun! My only caveat is that their drinks, that are very expensive around $14, are VERY weak. I don't mind paying top dollar for a drink if I get a buzz. I would highly recommend that you get your drink on some place else!<//text>

My hubby ordered what looked like a carne asada plate and that was good, all of it. Meat was cooked perfectly, green tomatillo rice and guac were great sides.
But...  my southern fried chicken was dry and lacked flavor. So I told this to the brunette waitress with an accent.
Waitress goes "oh thats weird that's our best selling dish".
Great. I dont give a shit. Must I explain myself? I felt I didnt need to. Dont have time for that....But I will explain HERE thanks to her arrogance cuz that bugged me, dude.
Im from the south. Lived in parts of South and North Carolina and im originally from Florida. I know what good southern fried chicken tastes like. This aint it. And honestly folks, I figured everyone would know a good chicken is packed with a good rub,marinade , or at least seasoned well with perfect moisture.
The rest of the stars actually goes to the bus boys especially ANDY. Omg; they did more work than the waitress did. Always repleneshing our drinks, asking if we need anything else (which we did while the waitress was nowhere in sight) and took our plates away and always had a GREAT attitude. Pay them more. Haha...

< Review>
As a picky, former fine dining manager, l am always thrilled to discover a restaurant that is beautiful, fun, well managed, with wonderfully creative cuisine and cocktails! Our waiter, José, was a delight. We had no reservation but we were welcomed like VIPs. Unfortunately, we can't enjoy Tropicale often because we live in San Diego.< /Review>

It was packed at 8:30p and thought my husband and I had to wait awhile but I'm guessing the advantage of being very pregnant (only two weeks left to go) was enough to get us seated immediately. Thanks to that lovely hostess!! Our waiter reminded me of The Wknd and he was absolutely Top Notch!! Our drinks were amazing (our waiter surprised me with a mocktail which turned out to be my fave alcoholic drink - Piña Colada - and my husband tried a new beer called Chimay). Food was perfect (I got filet mignon salad and my husband got the turkey burger). This was one of the best experiences I've ever had at a restaurant and we will definitely be coming back next time we are in the area. Next time we will try their famous fried chicken. My new fave restaurant!< /text>< pics>

Definitely over priced for the quality/taste of the food. The coconut martini was amazing, and the atmosphere is very nice so it's worth a visit.</text>

Just got home from Tropicale.  Great place for happy hour and meeting interesting people.  The drinks are top notch here, and the well brands are much better than what they try to give you at other places.  Great staff too.  We always get one or two of the small plates to snack on (or make a meal out of) during happy hour as well.  And, if you go next door to Copa for one of the shows, you can order Tropicale's small plates there up until 7 PM as well!  Very nice ambiance and always busy.  We haven't gone for a full dinner in a while, but when we do, we will let everyone know how it was!</review>

Given the prices I expected class and service but what I received was Applebee ambience and an overworked waitstaff. The pork chop was good and the rice was just covered in soy sauce. If this is in the top 5 for PS, looks like I'll be grilling out a lot.<//Text>

Horrendous Food and Horrendous Service!!
I will never set foot in this atrocious restaurant again.
The food is bland and goopy and God forbid you complain to the management, as they berate you and are completely unapologetic.
Truly gross.< /review>

Consistently good! Great service in a beautiful and whimsical setting, this is a must for a Palm Springs trip. Only complaint is they're very light handed on the booze in cocktails, which as a result are over priced, but great wine selection and fantastic food.<//text>

Favorite restaurant for locals, friends and their followers. Must come with an appetite, along with friends, family, a date, or yourself, who like to eat and drink! Portions are large and worthy to be called delicious - nothing terrible on the menu; prices are reasonable, too.</Text>

<review>We arrived 15 minutes early for our reservation that was booked one month in advance.  Our reservation could not be found i supplied my phone number and was informed that my reservation was canceled, which it was not. Clearly the restaurant was very busy and we were overlooked.  We had also requested an outdoor table.
A table was found for us inside after we stood around trying to stay out of everyone's way.    Our waiter was nice enough but just seemed to be in a big hurry when at our table. We all felt that we were in the right place to have that "amazing restaurant experience" but it just didn't happen the way it should have.  No outside dining for this group 😢 funny my reservation was canceled but got my notification to rate my ecperience.< /review><user_id>117285051692357796632< /user_id>< Pics>

Crowded. They kick you out of your table to rush next customers even when their service is slow. Bad planning in the assignment of tables.<//text>

<name>Robert Maykut<//name><UserId.>105249274928724491965</UserId.><text>Horrible experience. The place is overcrowded and management clearly has no concept of the volume of people that can be suitably housed in their establishment. Run over and pushed out of the way repeatedly by the wait staff, with no apologies and no chance to try get out of their way. Despite having made a reservation for 8 people weeks in advance, we were shown to a table for 6, then chairs crammed on to the ends. The only reason I gave this a 2 rating was because of 1 friendly person on staff, Sean, who waited on our table. Not going to rush back.</text></record></dataset><record>

This fooze mecca  is both sophistcate and alleycat. and both are made to feel welcome .....and  come to Tropical  to eat tasty food,  drink strong 'Make it all go away' cocktails, listen to live jazz, and remember when great places like this one were everywhere...sadly..so many are gone. But TROPICAL sparkles, sizzles,  and soothes.....the word you will be looking for when trying to describe your evening there is.....pizzazz...this lady has....pizzazz<//review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

<review>A bit too hip, too crowded and just okay food. Far better cuisine in PS unless being hip is your priority.< /review>< Rate>

< Review>
Been waiting 45mins for our reservation, the current wait times they tell guest is also 45 mins, still not seated at 50mins, food was subpar, atmosphere rushed, ruined our show we had lined up later(we were late), we didn't specify outside(inside was at 9pm), it was what was available when we made the reservation(730pm)at the time needed, Tony D would rather put down customers than correct the situation and admit they screwed up. We planned to have a full course meal w drinks but would you eat here after all that ?!? Still can't admit your mistakes!!!!</Review>

Good food.  But service is not so discreet. Feels like someone is always hovering. For the price of food,  would have expected more.</review>

< Review>
We came for Thanksgiving dinner, the food was OK but super pricy. We were forced to pay $65 per person. The thing was that most of the options in the fixed menu were not available. The manager was apologetic, but still overcharged us.
I guess we will not be coming back.< /Review>

Look, you know the Cobb Salad. You know it, everyone makes it. But this is more than that. The dressing, the chicken…I’ll never be able to eat a Cobb salad anywhere else. Everyone else piles on 20 different ingredients and calls it Cobb. When you look up Cobb salad in the dictionary, their Cobb salad should be the picture (this is only half.)</Text>

Everything closes early in Palm Springs but we wanted to get out a s get a drink. The desk concierge recommended The Tropicale. It said they closed at 11 we got there at 10:30 a d the place was jammin. Got a seat at the bat and had a BLAST’ Drink of choice a Watermelon Martini it was the bomb. Food choice was a Brie Burger for me and the man had the Calamari both were great. The bartenders were Ronnie, Fernando and Samuel excellent.  Will come again.< /Text>

(Translated by Google) Palm Spring Restaurant. A restaurant that has almost everything. Meat. Fish. Sushi. Mexican. All types of cocktails. Dishes .... The melir is definitely sane. Recommend to anyone in the area.

(Original)
מסעדה בפאלם ספרינג. מסעדה שיש בה כמעט הכל. בשר. דגים. סושי. מקסיקני. כל סוגי הקוקטיילים. מנות אחרונות....המליר שפוי בהחלט.  ממליצה למי שנמצאת באיזור.<//Review>
