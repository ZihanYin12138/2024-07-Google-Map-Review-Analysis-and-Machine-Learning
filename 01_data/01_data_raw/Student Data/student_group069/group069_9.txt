<user_name>Anna Huang</user_name><user>117484297776456111002</user><Review>I spent 30 minutes on the phone yesterday with a dispatcher on their toll free number to get literally nowhere. He was mumbling, also very obviously reading from a script. Didn't anunciate or take his time to actually tell me what to expect or what I needed. He apparently made an appointment for me, today- at 10am, I'm still waiting for a confirmation email to see the address because he literally told me nothing. Towards the end of the call he also yawned. He clearly does not want to be there nor does he actually care about building a profile with patients. What a terrible first impression.< /Review>< time>

This place is very unprofessional. Checked in for a 12:30 consultation.  The Dentist went to lunch along with the majority of the front desk staff. I decided to ask if i was going to be seen after waiting for 40 minutes. I was told i would be seen at 2. They failed to  communicate this long wait time to me. Not even a "sorry". They lack communication and it is a waste of time. I do not recommend this place.< /Text>

The office is clean, the staff is very conscientious of safety and their patients well being.  I am a big baby when it comes to dental work, but Dr. Liem helped me through it.  She was gentle and efficient.   The rest of the staff, (I apologize for not remembering all their names) were just as gentle and efficient.

I had my appointment at 2 it was 4:30 I asked how much longer and still asked me to wait another 45 min. As soon as i came in i knew that was a bad place, they had like 15 people in s small lobby. BAD BAD BAD ALLLLL BAD dont recommend. Dont come here. They dont care about patients they only care about getting money from insurance. The only reason i came here was because they recommended me for braces but if you’re looking for a nice dentist i recommend LOLLIPOP DENTIST ON PLACENTIA thats a very nice clean place, wonderful people, dont overbook themselves, in and out fast  every visit.</Review></record></dataset><record>

Everyone’s experience is different, but I can say that for the very first time ever. This place is and has been so far the best gentle and educated on their professions. If anyone is wondering if you have to live in this area to go here? No is the Answer. I’m from Palmdale 😁<//Review>

<text>These dentists are salesmen. They just want to make as much money off of you as possible. I was told I have gingivitis and needed a tray for my teeth which is custom molded and will put the medicine directly on my gums. The tray would have been for my bottom teeth only and cost $1000!! Once I refused because I can’t afford it(I’m unemployed due to the Rona) they were done with me. They never made any other recommendations on how I could try to combat this problem on my own... no toothbrush recommendation, no toothpaste recommendation, no mouthwash recommendation, no advice on any self care whatsoever. After doing a quick online search, I found out that because  I’m only at the beginning stage, I should be able to reverse it pretty easily, without spending $1000</text><name>Nicole Marcario<//name><response>{'time': 1603314955663, 'text': 'We are truly saddened that your experience was not as great as we would have liked.

Evey person in the Fullerton office is friendly n professional
They have a caring n genuine attitude n their personalities are comforting n have hearts .
Foom the time you in the woman that greets me n checks me in is very positive n happy n gives you a relaxing
Feeling before going in
They also are very helpful n gracious making appointments they are very nice
Also respectful about when I can come in .
What is really awesome is making sure that I can have a new smile n make it so I'm able to get the most from the resources available to me.
I give them 10  stars< /Review>

June R is nice but applied my braces too short. Another lady put my braces too long. Little inconveniences and they come to a halt with your procedures as if thousands wasn't enough. Can't get help until next appointment which is a month away so getting no progress done. They have forgotten my assigned appointments by them multiple times. They won't take me unless I have an appointment even though it was on them. They have me hostage to write a review after they've completed there few minutes with me.< /Review>

This was my first time visiting this dental office - nothing but great experiences from beginning to end  - I had a great deal of anxiety as do many individuals about dental care. The pain I was experiencing finally made it impossible to avoid.

I want to especially thank and recognize  Dr Shamooh. He is an amazingly kind and gentle oral surgeon ! His demeanor puts you at ease and his technique again was very gentle ! Great dentist !

The entire office staff has a pleasant flow and they demonstrate awesome team work which benefited me the patient and is highly appreciated !

If you need an extraction, root canal or dental surgeon again I can not recommend Dr Shamooh enough !<//Review>

I have been to western dental at Fullerton location three times now.  The first day they staff seem nice and professional, which encouraged me to come the next time with my family. However my second and third visits have been very terrible. They some of the staff seem rude and caring. They very disorganized and they not inform us about the long deals. They kept us waiting for 4 hours on our third visit. I became very sick and tired of waiting that I just left out been seen even though I had signed all the insurance papers.</Text>

I went in yesterday for a root canal and a crown. I was extremely nervous. I really thought it was going to be really bad. I was so afraid of the needles for the anesthesia, but the doctor was great, she made my whole experience way better. She was so caring, really understood my fears and needs and she attended them in a very human and professional way. She was very calm and knowledgeable, and her assistant Anjelica was the same way very professional, kind, caring, and knowledgeable too. The doctor really changed my whole experience yesterday. She put some of that numbing gel before she used the needles for the actual anesthesia, that REALLY changed everything for me, because then I didn’t even fell pain when she put the needles in. This office really is turning things around, please keep up the good work, and thank you for making my experience a whole lot better.<//Review>

Walked in without an appointment recently due to a dental emergency.  Was seen within 10 minutes!!  Walked out 10 minutes later with problem solved ! Total time: 20 minutes from start to finish.  I was truly blown away at quickly I was able to get in and out!< /Review>

I won't be giving Western Dental my business. After making a New Patient appointment online and being automatically rescheduled for a date that I was not available, Western Dental called me fifteen times from two different numbers, leaving a total of 6 voicemails about the missed appointment. Some calls came three or four times within an hour. After answering and telling them I was no longer interested in scheduling an appointment, I received five more calls before I decided to block all of their numbers. Absolutely unprofessional and borderline harrassing practices. Keep in mind, I am not a patient yet, I do not owe them any money, and this was simply an introductory appointment to see whether I wanted to use their services.<//text>

Please save your money and time and don't even think about it to go here.
waiting time with an appointment is more than the DMV waiting time without appointment. this place is just wasting time, make your angry and nervous. do yourself a big favor and don't go near this office at all.<//Text>

I took my son on wensday September 19 to western dental because his tooth where the filing was broke and it colected food. So when we got there we waited for about 15 minutes and final got into the xray room. The dentist said that he did not need a filing because the older tooth was coming out. But we went to the area where the dentist does there work. It took about 10 minutes to get it ready and finally it was done. On the 20 of September his filling poppet out. My problem is that they don't do a very good job.< /Review>

My appointment was at 9:15 a.m. so I got there at 9 a.m. I didn't leave till after 12. I waited over 3 hours just so they can tell me my insurance doesn't cover the deep cleaning. I did get x-rays but for what? Just so they can charge my insurance knowing that I wasn't covered for deep cleaning. What's the point of having insurance if you got to pay over $1,000 out of pocket. No wonder I haven't been to the dentist in such a long time because of all the crap you got to deal with. The place was clean and the staff was nice if that means anything to you.< /Review>

(Translated by Google) I had a bad experience in this office and it is not the first of western dental, I called to make an appointment to the number they gave me and when I got to the office they told me that they had called me to cancel and I had no call from them the answer they gave me Was it that the people in charge of making appointments do not have access to the availability of the office, so why authorize them to make appointments? LITTLE PROFESSIONALS AT LEAST I DO NOT RETURN an apology or anything for making me waste time.

I am so happy to have finally found a stylist after four years in Sacramento! I found Rosalie on Salon Bravissimo's website, which indicated she was a perm specialist. I had gotten a perm a few months prior at a different salon and I didn't have the best experience. I was hoping Rosalie could help me, and she did!! I went in for a consultation about a week prior to my appointment where we went over what she would do and exactly how much it would cost, which I very much appreciated.  My hair looks great.. I get so many compliments on it. She gave me her personal cell phone number and even followed up with me several times via text. I felt like, and still feel like, she truly cares about how everything turned out.
From what I could tell, every stylist there looked like they had their stuff together! Everyone client who left while I was there looked amazing. Could not recommend this place more.</Text>

Great salon!  Extremely clean and efficient. Love that I can make an appointment on line and don't have to call. Parking can be an issue, small lot and was very crowded when I was there, a Friday afternoon, but may not be so bad other times.  I will go back.<//text>

Salon Bravissimo is a fun and friendly place to have your hair cut and styled by knowledgeable
professionals.  My favorite is David Mary.  Ask for him if you are looking for a new and reliable place and competent stylist!  They do many other beauty treatments as well.  You can find a list on their web site.  They have something to meet every need.  I've been happily serviced by them for several years!  Give them a try!< /text>

Had my hair done by Katie, I showed her a picture of what I wanted and she nailed it. She took her time with my hair and made sure everything aligned perfectly. Got to the salon thinking I was just getting a simple haircut but the results made it feel like more.

I REFUSE to go anywhere else for my hair or eyebrows!! Salon Bravissimo has proven to be the best in Sacramento! Behnaz is an absolute hair artist and Denh is an eyebrow master! Love all the salon and spa artists here! Everyone is friendly and the reception area offers you water,tea or coffee right when you walk in. The prices are reasonable for how exceptional the service is as well!</Text>

Behnaz was amazing!! She understood what I wanted even when I didn’t know exactly how to explain it. She was so kind and personable. I loved my haircut, color, and overall experience and would highly recommend her.<//Text>

P-1 was absolutely AMAZING and very professional. He didn’t make me feel like a new customer, instead he made me feel like he had known me forever he made me feel like a friend! He  did an awesome job on my hair as well! I left loving my new hair.</Review>

< Review>
Had my haircut yesterday by Sandra B. At Salon Bravissimo- And I am very happy.  I can be a bit picky, but she exceeded my expectations from the way the back is blended and lays down to the fade on the sides and back.  I will definitely come back whenever I am in the area!< /Review>

<Review>I arrived to my hair appointment on time, however I was told to wait outside in 102 degree heat or wait in my car until my hairdresser was ready. I understand the need for social distancing, and the need to lesson extra bodies in the salon, but I was perturbed to find out that I had to wait outside, in the excessive heat, for my appointment when I arrived on time. I ended up waiting 30 minutes outside.When my
hair appointment was completed, keeping in mind that I've been to the salon for several years with the same treatment done, I was surprised that it  was $175, when I typically paid between $120-130.  I really felt price gouged. I never had that happen before. I understand that times are hard, especially for salons during this pandemic, but everybody's hurting and no one deserves to be price gouged, especially long-standing customers. So disappointing!< /Review>< Pictures>

{'time': 1593179053591, 'text': 'Hi Vanessa, we apologize that you had to wait outside in the heat. Due to COVID-19 California State Guidelines for Salons and Barbershops, Social Distancing requirements states -  "If possible, implement virtual check-in technology to ensure that workers are notified when a customer arrives. Ask customers to wait outside or in their cars rather than congregating in the salon or barbershop." We understand that these are unprecedented times and we are trying our best to do our part to keep clients safe. We will be implementing outdoor coolers to help make the outdoor seating area more comfortable. I also looked at your service history and your recent service was a highlight partial and color. Your previous appointments were color and toner. There is a price difference between the services rendered. I can also have your stylist reach out to you if you have any questions about your service. We do apologize that your stylist ran late as we try to be on time most of the time. We value your feedback and are constantly trying to find the balance in the new norm that has been recently implemented.'}< /Response>

I wanted a balayage instead they gave me highlights. Didn’t find out until after they were being half way done, and since I have never done balayage I wasn’t sure what was going on I was under the assumption I was getting that.<//review>

I went to see Avery Clarke at Salon Bravissimo and am thrilled with the cut and color he did for me. He spent so much time on my cut and color and it shows. The salon is really clean and welcoming. They use all the best products as well. Everyone was really friendly as well and  I will definitely be a return customer and recommend them to my friends and family.</Review>

<Text>Originally I gave a 5 star review back in November.   My cut and color was 135 for long hair (reasonable).  I went for the same thing in January and it was 90.  I went to today and it was 175 for the same thing I got the past two times!!! That's ridiculous and insane.  I thought I was building a relationship with my hairdresser, but I clearly was not.  I feel like I was taken advantage of.  Also note that when booking my appointment it said it would be 130 for cut and color.< /Text><resp>{'time': 1553155954843, 'text': 'Paige, wow!

I went to this salon and stylist because of their reviews-- but let me tell you: NOT worth it.

I went to get my medium/long hair (halfway down my back) cut-- nothing drastic, bringing it up a few inches and fixing the layering.  Online and when I called, I was told it would cost about $75, as I was scheduled to see a "master stylist."

Walked it, stylist was late to start the appointment.  After a very short consultation, had my hair washed by an assistant and the stylist started.  Fine-- not very friendly, but haircut was fine-- nothing special, but got the job done.  Took about 20 minutes.

However-- then, the stylist stuck me under a dryer, because she said she didn't want to dry my hair herself, but that she'd finish up once it was a bit dyer.  As I sat there, watching time go by, the stylist took ANOTHER client.  In the middle of my appointment, she ignored me entirely to cut this gentleman's hair.  Noticing that I'd been sitting there for 30 minutes, an assistant finished drying my hair for me.  Absolutely ridiculous.

Already unhappy that my stylist decided to put me on hold to deal with someone else -- and 2 hours later, no less-- I was checking out, and the total on the haircut was more than $100.

$100+ for a 20 minute cut -- and an appointment that lasted 2 hours so that my stylist could take another client.

Needless to say, this is the worst salon experience I have ever had.  Don't waste your time or your money-- unprofessional, overpriced, and a total ripoff.<//Text>

Don't go here unless you want your hair messed up. My hair was have platinum blonde and half black all I asked for was a root touch up and a few low lights in the back of my hair just light the photo I showed Tiffany the hair dresser she said she could do it. Then after she washed my hair and started blow drying it my hair was gray and she said oh it will wash it it just the toner. Which it never did so I went want and asked for a refund which all they said was we can try to correct it and all they did was put in four dark low lights which made it even worse. Then I went back a third time and told them I was very unhappy with my hair and they wouldn't even give me a refund so that I could fix it. Overall they had bad customer service and I would recommend.<//Review>

<Text>Hair is important! That is why I have been going to Salon Bravmismo for over seven years. Joy and her team do an amazing job.  I have fine, curly, thin hair. You would be shocked at my before and after pictures. Joy has given me a head full of beautiful extensions that are safe for my delicate hair; Katie and Julia have been handling my color and keratin treatments. I would not think of going anywhere else. My friend (who is lucky to have thick hair) gets ombré coloring at the salon and it looks amazing!  You can't go wrong with any of the stylists at this place. Well worth the price!! It’s a contemporary and elegant setting. Joy and her staff know the latest hair techniques. They make problem hair look great and good hair look outstanding.</Text>< pics>

<user_name>Tara Bite<//user_name><Text>My hair was a mess from a previous salon that did horrible highlights and I felt like a 50 shades of mess. So I read the reviews and made an appointment on a whim. My Stylist Ahmari (very young girl) was incredibly talented and thorough which impressed me. She informed me of what needed to be done to get the color corrected. I was also impressed that the manager came by and introduced herself and made sure I was comfortable with what needed to be done before and during my correction. It was one of the few places that listened to my concerns and got it right. Kudos to you!</Text><gmap_id>0x809ada5640b0cebb:0x9dc8be7268d4c9cb<//gmap_id><Time>1506064601766< /Time><rating>5</rating><response>{'time': 1506105185427, 'text': "Thank you for the wonderful feedback Tara!

I have visited this salon on three occasions, each time to see stylist Holly. The first two visits went well, and I had color and cut done each time. My last visit did not go well. I gave Holly a formula for the color which I have used for many years.  She wanted to change the formula, and was annoyed when I said no. She had used this formula on the two prior visits, and did not try to change it

I asked for a one-inch trim for the haircut to which she agreed. Holly then informed me that the hair in the back was longer and had grown out faster than the front. Without informing me or securing my permission, she then proceeded to cut at least two inches from the back. The front is also too short, and the cut is unflattering, since she also took off too much from the front . When I commented that she had taken too much off, she insisted she had done what I asked. Unfortunately, she did not. Holly also informed me that another client had called the salon to complain about the same issue--too much hair taken off.  She was apparently told to check with the client before cutting. Although we agreed on one inch, she took off far more.

The back of my hair had not grown faster,  but she used this as an excuse to cut far more hair than I requested. She did what she wanted. Some stylists want to impose their will on you, and she is one of them.   They want to change something that is already working for you. Unless you want to take this kind of risk, I do not recommend her.

I contacted this salon by email expressing my concern but received no response. This makes the business look bad as it is clear they do not care about the quality of my experience. This salon has been highly rated but I question this rating given my experience.

I have now discovered that hair dye came off on a brand new towel, even though I waited several days after the color had been applied before washing my hair. Hair dye also came off on a blouse I wore to the salon that day. The towel and the blouse are ruined.

I believe this stylist developed a personal animosity which came as an unpleasant surprise.  Her conduct was unprofessional and designed to discourage me from returning. She and the salon have their wish.<//Text>

<Text>I was a client here for over 5 years with Kristin Fitzgerald. Kristin destroyed my long dark hair by bleaching it all and leaving the product on my head for almost 4 hours. I trusted her to "lighten up my hair a little bit" for summer, as was suggested and actually pushed on me by Kristin. I DID NOT ASK for light or blonde hair, in fact she knows I keep it dark since she had been doing my hair for 5 years and she knew I was hesitant to do what she was suggesting. She even admitted that she should have prepared me better. She choses to LIE now and say that I asked for that service. My hair broke off and 6 torturous months went by while the salon charged me to try to mend it. My hair went from being down to the middle of my back to now being at my ears. Michael Wu and Joy Ho have ZERO regard for what happened. They cannot understand how my decision to cancel work appointments were affected by the huge patches of hair falling out of my head. They can't understand how they should be liable for the 12 trips I had made and hours in their salon because Kristin knew she was negligent and wanted to cover up her mistake. Now she just resorts to lying. They think I should be thankful Kristin came in on a day off to treat my hair. Why would someone do that unless they knew they screwed up? I feel assaulted by a group of people whom I've trusted and continually given my business to. Kristin knew she was damaging my hair when she left me processing for too long and by lifting my dark color so fast and now everyone at Salon Bravissimo accepts NO accountability. I now have to file a small claim in order to recover my financial losses due to their negligence. I never requested the service that took away 10 years of hair growth and my identity. I am saddened that Kristin would lie or that these salon owners would defend such negligent actions. I think even a new cosmetology student would know better than to leave bleach on someone for hours. At very least they would test a patch of hair first before trying to do such an extreme color lift, which by the way WAS NOT REQUESTED. I would think twice before trusting a salon owned by people who will completely ignore a long time client when their stylists are in the wrong. Kristin was up-selling me to increase her own profit margin and was not at all concerned with my preference of keeping my hair dark. You have no recourse when it comes to your hair and the trauma experienced when someone destroys your appearance and these people only care about your immediate dollar, not you as a person or your past loyalty. I will now be filing complaints with the board of cosmetology so this does not happen to someone else. See photos</Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Name>Carla Ferrante</Name>< userid>

From the moment you walk in you know you're in a posh salon but without the dismissive service you'd expect to see in other high end salons.

The products that are sold are top of the line and luxurious as well as the best styling tools.

You can see from every corner the hard work of Joys labor of love she puts in ensuring your service will be fantastic and making sure you'll br a repeat customer.

Joy and her staff always work me in even when she's booked to the nines and you feel welcomed no matter what.

And finally she treats each and every client individually and caters to their specific needs.<//Review></record>

< Review>
Had a men's haircut appointment and they scheduled me with someone that doesn't cut men's hair typically. So they offered me an appointment with Someone that does in 15-20 minutes; I accepted it. Then later they offer me another lady that charges even more. HORRIBLE customer service and the receptionists have no idea what's going on.</Review>

<Text>My girlfriend went here to get an ombre done, which her hair was half way there  the stylist or hairdresser told her she couldn't do that in one day. My girlfriend already knowing that showed her a picture and told her that the previous hair dresser did it in one day. The hair dresser seen a picture and still did it wrong, almost completely backwards.  Also the previous hair dresser charged her 50 bucks less then what she paid here. So now she hates the way it came out and feels like she wasted the money on what she didn't want. she couldn't go to the previous hair dresser because we don't live in that city anymore.  So yes you can say my girlfriend hates this place now.< /Text><gmap_id>0x809ada5640b0cebb:0x9dc8be7268d4c9cb< /gmap_id>< pictures>

Ask for Sooji!! She is the queen of hair. I found Sooji at Salon Bravissimo and have been going here ever since! From start to finish, my experience in the salon is always immaculate-- Joy and her team are phenomenal! Sooji always takes her time in whatever she does, ensuring the job is WELL done. She has an eye for what looks good or what might suite you better. Whether it's coloring/cutting/styling my hair, or touching up my eyelash extensions.. I have left extremely satisfied every time. Sooji pays very close attention to detail and I would recommend anybody to go see her!</text>

This review is for Behnaz Azargam. When my long time stylist moved away I tried for several years, and endured many poor cuts, until I found Behnaz. I have long, thick, wavy hair, and a LOT of it so I need someone who really knows what they're doing. I also like highlights that look natural enough when growing out, since I only like to do color a few times a year. Behnaz is wonderful, and you can tell she keeps up with all the latest hair trends. She offers great suggestions and styling tips. I'm so relieved that I can once again count on loving my hair each time I leave the salon. Thanks Behnaz!</Text>

Six to eight weeks ago, after my haircut with Emily, I scheduled my next appointment at the counter for 12/5/13 at 10:00 am.  I was given an appointment card.  I called today to confirm my appointment-they had nothing scheduled.  VERY frustrating as now my schedule has to be rearranged, because of THEIR mistake.<//Review>

Amanda at this location went above and beyond to make my experience fantastic. She made sure I was comfortable with the car and price and even picked me up from a near by hotel. Everything from getting the car and returning the car went smoothly. Thank you Amanda and your team!< /text>

<Review>Hello, it all started with I rented a car on Tuesday morning around 7:30, I didn’t brother checking the car because I was I a rush and had to be at work soon.  BIG MISTAKE. After work around 7 I smelled a strong order coming from the back I was shocked, disgusted and disappointed to see dried VOMIT in the back seat so I immediately called the store which was closed then processed to call the 1800 number to inform them about the situation they only offered to return it to the airport which I couldnt due to the fact it was late and I had 2 half hr drive so unfortunately I managed to drive smell of vomit.12/28 This morning while I was trying to return I spoke to Brice the manger and told him I either need my entire refund back and I’m not refilling up the gas or I need to keep the car until the main manger comes and will figure it out from there, he then process to take the keys and drive off with the car with my belonging still in the car. I didn’t know what else to do so i call the police when they arrived he stated he when to go fill up the gas and that I would be charged for the gas when clearly I didn’t want to return the car unless I was being refunded.. He is a bad manger and even worse human , you guys where clearly in the wrong and he made the situation worse and made me feel uncomfortable acting as if I was the bad guy the whole time.  It’s not only a safely hazard but just gross how he could think it’s acceptable. From the vomit to the car to the customer service I don’t know which one is worse. I would like my full refund and not to be charged gas for the rental if anything I need an apologize from both Brice and the main manger.
12/30 Received a call from Charlie the manger at the store instead of helping out once again he tried to cover up his tracks stating he took the car home the night before there no way there can be vomit and he proceeded to charge me for the rental except for the gas it’s not until I called back asking for my receipt he stated that I’ll get my full refund after he charged me because he doesn’t want this to go to corporate. Sorry this facility deserves a new manger</Review><Pics>None</Pics><Response>{'time': 1577809421662, 'text': 'Thank you for your review, 90stateofmind.

My Experience with this enterprise was really great. They gave me a very neat and clean car. Catherine was very polite and she made sure that we get a great service. Also they picked me and dropped with ease. I would definitely like to rent here going forward. Thanks for your good service.</review>

<Text>I rented twice with Enterprise Rental on Claremont, San Mateo, Ca. I was super impressed with Marcio and Charlie professionalism, warmth and friendliness. They treated me and each customer that hd come in before me with care and provided undivided attention.
This is the reason why I chose to return to this location vs. SF airport and Hillsdale location! They went out of their way to a specific car (Ford Hybrid Fusion) and they brought it over! I was so happy and feel super confident of returning to them for future rentals especially since they are also part of National Rental Car! Thank you Marcio and Charlie for your exemplary service!< /Text><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

The location is small, and the lot is a bit tight. However, the service was fast, efficient, and very friendly. I had the opportunity to work with both local agents, who unfortunately I can't remember their names. But, they both provided me the top of the line service I have come to expect from Enterprise.</review>

The staff here are great, professional, and very helpful best customer service in the area. The reason I gave it a 4 not 5 is the quality of the cars. They are clean and everything but every time I get a new one it drives horribly. This could be the make of the cars being low end.</Text>

Reserved a full size car, when I arrived at the counter at 1:30 pm there were no full size available and I was told I would be "upgraded" to a jeep vehicle.  This vehicle with 12,000 miles shut off while driving on a rural highway.  Called enterprise and it took over 2 hours for a tow truck to arrive in 100 degree plus heat.  Enterprise made arrangements for me to pick up another vehicle at another location.  I was told a Nissan Maxima was reserved for me.  The other location was 35 miles from the rural highway.  When I arrived at the other location I was informed that the Maxima was just rented out and I was given another high mileage jeep.  I had to drive 35 miles back to the highway to continue my trip.  A 5 hour drive turned into a 10 hour drive.  Terrifying experience!!!<//review>

Great deals on cars, sometimes the weekly rate is cheaper than the daily rate. They're open on Sundays too, so you don't have to wait an extra day to return your car.< /text>

They had several flies in the bakery cases which was rather offputting. We decided to try a few items anyway. There is a good variety of baked goods, we got a brownie and some cookies which were both good, but I won't be returning or recommending it due to the flies within all of the cases.<//Review>

I came here for the first time on a quest to find the best cannoli in San Diego. I've tried cannoli from about 30 different places in San Diego so far and I'd have to say that these are by far the best. Not only did they have great cannoli, they have a lot of other food options. The guy at the counter was very nice and let me try different samples before I bought items. I loved everything I tried. I wish I could give more than five stars.<//Text>

We loved this bakery. Not only did they have great Italian pastries but sandwiches, coffee and a few Latin food items. They also have a small breakfast menu.  I wish I could post a picture but we ate it all</Text>

Sweet staff - but the food was unforgivably old.  The cookies were beautiful; but stale. The bagle I purchased, was so hard there is no way they didn't know it was stale when they put it in the bag. We got our treats to go and (tried) to eat everything within an hour of purchase. 80% of it went in the trash.  Very disappointed.</Text>

It's alright.  Better options in Little Italy.  Probably a good breakfast option if you live in the area.  Very slow service for a time when the place was empty except for us. The pastachote pastry was very thick crusted, almost pie crust like which it shouldn't be.  Took about 30 minutes for two sandwiches.  Prices are good.  Wouldn't travel out of my way to it but might get something if I had the time to wait.  2.5 stars if I could put it instead.</Text>

The first time we had the pleasure of walking into this bakery, we we greeted by the owner who was incredibly friendly to my daughter and I, after finding out it was our first time there, he gave a free cookie to both of us. The prices are super affordable,  and since i have lived in east county a majority of my life, i was surprised to just discover it.</Review>

<review>Awful! Not a New York Bakery at all. Middle Eastern clerk and hard to understand. The bread was hard as a rock and cookies were stale.

A real New York Bakery knows what a Florentine cookie is. This one does not.

Skip this place, you're better off with grocery store bakery cookies.<//review>< Pictures>

I asked the lady at the front counter if they have Italian bread, she shows me medium Italian bread, I asked if they can slice for me, she said that they can't do the slice because the slicer machine is big for that bread. She suggested me to pace an order for big bread in order to be sliced. I found later that the slicer machine can be adjustable to any size of bread. It is clear that this lady did not want to do her job. Definitely, I don't recommend this bakery.<//review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

<text>I just visited yesterday being from new York wanted something sweet real fast. The clerk has her boyfriend just walking around cracked out... eyeballing girls as they walk bye or in the store. He was very rude and aggressive. Since it was Sunday I gave him the Lord's pass but I will never forget or go in that hole again. I promise to do everything in my power to have the business license revoked. To the weak ass womanizer that's hiding behind someone's store I will see you and it will be a different story next time.<//text>< date>

<Rate>5< /Rate><review>I didn't think a genuine New York style Italian bakery and restaurant existed in southern California. But then I found New York Bakery. The sausage and pepper sandwiches, the bread, the Arrancini (rice balls), and pastries are authentically New York Italian. I look for excuses to be in that part of El Cajon just so I can stop for a quick bite at this remarkable establishment.I am thrilled that I no longer have to drive from East County to Little Italy for good food and imported items. I hope this wonderful culinary Heaven remains in business a long, long time.<//review><pics>None< /pics><response>None<//response>< GmapID>

I always eat there bread and some tea. However, please patronize the NY Bakery when you park in front of his business. It's very rude to park your car then walk to the court house... Then leave. .. I have my breakfast here every morning. I see what goes on.</Text>

<Text>This place is a four 🌟 place but they have trump stuff everywhere... With approval ratings in the low teens (from "fake news") they might want to tone it down a bit.

Oh ya and the flies in the food case, that was just nasty...<//Text>< Gmap_id>

<user_name>Martha Riveros</user_name><time>1571185060878< /time><Rate>4<//Rate><Text>(Translated by Google) They offer Colombian pastries, tamales, chocolate, etc. I would really appreciate that they served Colombian chocolate because I couldn't take the one they offered super redulce. The tamale needs seasoning and that the almojabanas are not so floury.
I congratulate you for those milojas, roscones (I lack the one of Guyana) and other pastry.
Thank you and many successes.

(Original)
They offer Colombian pastries, tamales, chocolate, etc. Realmente apreciaria mucho que sirvieran el chocolate Colombiano porque no me pude tomar el que ofrecieron super redulce. Al tamal le hace falta sazón y que las almojabanas no sean tan harinosas.
Los felicito por esas milojas, roscones (les falto el de guayana) y demas pasteleria.
Gracias y muchos exitos.< /Text>< pics>

<Review>Never had an issue up until I had to do an exchange on a gift. Unprofessional to have a client wait 2 hrs just to be told that the vans can't be exchanged because they were probably not purchased originally at a vans store. Ridiculous.<//Review><gmapID>0x80dcaccf49a34e93:0x51691106e959f8d1</gmapID>< Rate>

<Text>The woman who helped us was rude. I didn't get her name, but she had  teal colored hair. We were trying to return some things and she gave us attitude like as if we were trying to rip her off or something. Didn't get money back but got an exchange that's the only reason why I'm even giving 1 star.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

My daughter and myself have been going to this location for over 10 years, I am so glad that they are able to open again since the pandemic closure, they have added so many safety measures that they should be commended, all of these girls work so hard snd with a smile. We go to Helen and Tina who are sisters and they are awesome, I can’t say enough nice things about them, but they are all great.< /review>

<Review>LONG WAIT!!! BEWARE!!
I went to this location for a very long time. I stopped going there because every time I had an appointment I would still have to wait up to 30 minutes to have my nails or feet worked on. I would actually get up and ask the girl I booked the appointment for if she was aware that I had an appointment with her and she would say yes but she’s working on someone else. I finally got tired of it and switched nail salons. What’s the point of making an appointment if you still have to wait?? I can understand a 5 or 10 minute wait but it was always 20-30 minutes. No thanks!</Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

Sky Nails was my nail shop for 21 years. If I didn't have to move I'd be going there for 21 more years! Lannie and her staff always have the best service. And their nails are bomb! People always commented on how my nails looked so natural ❤️<//Text>

I rarely see broken machines like the other gyms I have been to. The atmosphere is more intense which helps motivate me to do better. I love how everyone puts their weights and attachments back when they are done and wipe everything down. Masks are worn at all times unless you’re doing cardio then you can pull it down to reveal your nose. I feel safe and comfortable here- no creeps I must add as opposed to Excel, Cal Fit, and Fitness 19 where men would follow me around the gym, to my car, and even home.

<review>The facility is excellent,  but do not sign up for a trainer! You must sign a 12 month contract and pay up front. If you don't use all your sessions within 16 months,  you lose out. Also, there is no guarantee.  If you change your mind,  you will not get refunded. You can get all you need by watching videos on YouTube for free.< /review>< user_name>

Just joined. Friendly staff, very welcoming.  Super clean (seems even the patrons take more pride in keeping the gym as it should be, organized and safe) doesn't feel like a daycare as many other gyms have immature patrons. Here they rerack their weights, refrain from dangerous activities and all around  Etiquette. Highly recommend<//text>

Great gym. Here's a waffle recipe:

Ingredients 250g Flour (plain)
7g Baking powder
20g Caster sugar
5g Salt
475ml Milk
2 Eggs
30ml Vegetable oil

Method

•Weigh all the dry ingredients, place in a large mixing bowl. Break the eggs into the milk and beat the mixture.

•Add the egg and milk mixture to the dry ingredients. Add the oil and mix all ingredients together until all the large lumps have been broken up. Do not over mix otherwise the waffles will be heavy when cooked.

•Pre heat the waffle maker and spray with oil (1 cal spray works well).

•Pour 3/4 of a cup of batter into the waffle maker and cook for 3-4 mins or until golden brown and crispy on the outside.

•Serve hot with maple syrup. Also good served with sliced banana or blueberries.

•Cooked waffles can be frozen and heated up in the toaster. Unused batter mixture can be kept in a container in the fridge for up to 2 days.<//text>

This is one of the better gyms in the Sacramento/Roseville region. The equipment is clean and nice. People are nice and respectful, they are all there to work out and not chatter like other gyms. The monthly membership aren't bad either. I figured places like lifetime fitness charges $100+ a month for the same equipment, if you're serious about working out and don't need a built in salon go here.</Review>

Front desk understood right away how badly I needed to throw some weights around. After searching the area for a decently priced gym, low enrollment and no haggling with pricing until I at least explored the gym. I was offered a 3 day pass to explore and try a class. So I worked out and signed up right after because I appreciated the efforts made on behalf of the gym. Great atmosphere and motivated folks who are there to work out! Thank you Golds</Review>

<Review>I have to say, it’s a really nice gym. Very nice equipment and double machines. Me and my boyfriend were members here for about a month. I really liked going here. I have to say, I didn’t like that the rude/ steroid user guys that would stare at you while you were working out. It made me and my boyfriend uncomfortable many times. I also want to complain about the management and a couple staff members. I was very disappointed when me and my significant other were confronted by an employee. He approached me aggressively and scared me a little bit. He told us that we couldn’t park in the “non marked bike parking”. Which clearly, it ISNT marked. Some of the morning staff are utterly horrible and have terrible attitudes. They aren’t friendly whatsoever and are rude. They are unfriendly and it’s honestly annoying. I hated walking by them on my way into the gym, to do my early morning workouts. I got my money back but, I would NOT recommend coming here. Horrible staff and management.</Review><GmapID>0x809adf89fbe4e57d:0xa64ef7d4667312c9</GmapID><Response>{'time': 1547069216832, 'text': 'The only interaction my staff had with Lana was greeting her at our front desk when she checked-in and saying goodbye to her when she left.

<text>This gym had so much potential but after signing up my girlfriend and I quickly starting realizing we were lucky to have signed up with the one cool staff member named Brandon. Everyone else especially some guy named Joe and the manager or owner named David are complete douchebags. My girlfriend and I had gotten used to the unfriendly way that the staff was when you check in and leave by not knowing how to say good morning or bye even though we tried countless times. We decided to just ignore that Joe guy in the mornings to not let him ruin our workouts but then one day this guy had the audacity to approach us in an aggressive and confrontational manner over a parking space which apparently was supposed to be for motorcycles only even though it wasn't marked and numerous other vehicles parked there all the time. He continued by reprimanding us as if we were children and went on to say that he had warned us already when neither my girlfriend nor I had ever been talked to about any off limit parking spot. I tried explaining to Joe that he must be confusing us with someone else but he just kept wanting to argue so rather than lowering ourselves to his level we tried leaving and taking up the matter with a manager thinking he was probably better trained in customer service and conflict resolution. Needless to say the guy (David) who contacted us back was just as bad by completely fabricating the facts and turning the story and blame around by saying he had verified with another staff member who was supposedly working there that day and said we were the aggressors and Joe was merely trying to explain to us in a calm tone that we weren't allowed to park there. I know this is complete BS because there was no female staff member working there that day. I never thought for a split second that we would've received such a horrible response to our complaint about Joe. Our thoughts were that a good manager would apologize to the members and try to work on training his staff better. David and Joe must be friends or family or something because I can't explain it any other way. Stay away from this gym unless you want to have to deal with rude staff members and managers.< /text>< pictures>

< Review>
In relation to the gyms around this area, this gym is absolutely PERFECT for me. The staff are nice and easy to talk to and ask questions and the weight floor is full of equipment! They have nearly a dozen benches that you can move around as you wish (compared to Cal Fam Fit which only has 4) and they are the ONLY place that I've found near Roseville that had more than 3 power racks (They have 5!). This place is for serious lifters and that was exactly the environment I wanted to find.

The people are nice and I've only had positive experiences with the people in my short 2 month membership of this gym. I could ask other members questions about equipment and they'd often be more than happy to help.

Sure this place doesn't have a sauna or a pool but they have absolutely everything that you need to change yourself for the better. If I find that i'm in need of a gym again down the line, I will be sure to pick this Gold's Gym over anything else in the area.<//Review>

<text>Great gym. Friendly staff. Good environment. Very clean. Lots of high quality equipment. Fair pricing. Downside is that its kind of cramped in there. Sometimes hard to find what you need. Not a lot of room to maneuver or perform circuits and superset, etc.<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

Great place! Clean! Fantastic pricing and friendly staff and people.
Wish they remove some of the machines that no one uses and open up some space for more crossfit based work outs.
Locker rooms are always clean and showers are clean as well.</Review>

<text>Just signed up and the vast amount of equipment is drool worthy for a weight lifter. I have yet to try all the different equipment, but the ones I have I love tremendously. Right now they got a deal for no enrollment fee , then 9 bucks for your first month and 19.99 after being your regular monthly, very good deal and is why I joined. Everything is brand spanking new to.</text>< Pics>

<review>This gym has lots of different machines, classes, clean showers, and in the 3 years I've been going here,  I've never had to wait for a treadmill. I love love love this gym.

<Text>Auto charged $500 for personal training after a 3 month promotion that was cancelled before the trial period expired. When we spoke with them, our only option was to "use up" $500 worth of training or lose the money. 5 years of loyalty meant nothing at all.

We've been open at this location in Citrus Heights for 2 years (it's our only location in the Sacramento area), we do not offer a $500 personal training package, and your name doesn't come up in our membership database.

This is a great overall gym. They have equipment for the regular gym goer, bodybuilders, powerlifters and oly lifters. My only problems here are the fact they don't allow use of chalk at ALL. I understand it can be messy but its a gym. Maybe allow it in the power racks only? Also they recently banned all picture taking and videos. I can understand they want to protect the privacy of other members but they banned ALL of it so I can't even video my own sets to check form or post it on YouTube. I will probably be looking for a more hardcore gym but this place is cheap and well equipped. Most people with have no complaints.<//text>

Amazing mecca for a record collector in search of well curated 45s and LPs. The owner is very hospitable and will help you find what you are looking for. This place is a must and a highlight for 60s soul collectors.< /Text>

<user_name>Monica< /user_name><date>1600382290953</date><rate>5< /rate><Text>I had an amazing experience visiting Rooky's for the first time. Upon arrival I was blown away by the mass qtys of 45s, which is what I came in looking for. I was warmly greeted by the owner, who asked me if I was looking for anything specific.
I was a bit overwhelmed by how much there was so him directing me to the area he thought I might best find what I wanted (he was right) I started digging!
Within the first 90 mims I had pulled at least 20 of interest, before having to run out and feed my meter. (You know it's a good dog when you have to feed your meter several times in one trip!)
Once I realized how long I had been in there I decided to stop digging and make my final selections. Besides the more expensive records for sale- all which were priced $5 or $10- there was also three times as many for sale priced at 3/$5.
After dbl checking my discogs where I have all my records I own inventoried (no more duplicate purchases- yay!) I narrowed my final selection down to 12 which I was super happy with. The best part was that four of them were ones on my wishlist!!
When I went to pay, the wonderful owner mentioned that I could bring him a wishlist and he'd be happy to see if he had any of them, which I thought was so great!
Besides how huge of a selection and the fair pricing, it was the kindness and helpfulness of the owner that really impressed me most. He was very sweet and genuinely wanted to help me and not just to make a quick sale. I mean this bc when I was about to pay, I asked him what Styrene meant. He explained the easiest way to tell and explained how vinyl esp motown would wear out over many plays, and suggested that I listen to a stevie wonder 45 I had in my hands just to be sure it was still in good playable cond. So he took me over to the turntables and showed me how to properly use it to  DBL check my selections, which I did. As a result, I put 3 of my 12 back. And even though he might have lost $5 on my total sale that day, his honesty and helpfulness will keep me coming back now again and again!
Overall it was a hugely positive 3 hour shopping experience, and I can't wait for my next dig!!< /Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNPDPw_0PgaArmrj3keAMvanvLxLq2vYWaJqv0S=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMNmFuQaeeSY37NwCUVdB-Trq8gSyp3B4XZNZUm=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures><resp>None</resp><gmapID>0x808580a134cefa15:0x65eafed9f8b13133< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

If you are looking for vinyl this is the place to go. On a typical day, if you're at the listening station, you'll see the oddest selection of the Buying and Selling vinyl cognoscenti slink in and out of the back room as they work their dark deals. Good news though: The scraps left behind by these apex predators are an eclectic and fascinating mix of old and new Soul, Funk, Gospel, Blues - Rock and Proto-Rock and at fair prices.  Somehow I ended up with the new Nick Waterhouse (Self Titled) LP - and it wasn't even available yet online.

Word of warning though - the proprietor is not a patient man and should be approached cautiously - he really knows his stuff, but if you walk in there in your favorite loafers and no socks - and start musing about how well 'curated' the place is, you are looking for trouble (as I learned).

When I saw that the local game in the back room is Cassino - I decided flex my card tactics to recover my honor. I was soundly put in my place there too -  but ended up with a nice branded felt slip mat for my trouble.< /text>

A number of records primarily from the 50s/60s/70s. Knowledgeable owner but can come across as daunting due to his deep level of expertise. Go in with a few thoughts around what you want to buy or need recommendations on and prepare to have your wallet feel lighter< /review>

Phenomenal record store. Excellent prices, startlingly good vinyls, and wonderful staff. The ability to listen to LPs before buying them is something rare and priceless that really brings Rooky Ricardo's to the next level. Wonderful store! Would recommend to anyone and everyone 😊</Review>

If you love soul music, funk, r'n'b - you just gotta visit Rooky Ricardo's Records in San Francisco. This records store has got soul! And you can feel it through every vynil & through every 45. The collection is amazing and is full of rarities you won't find anywhere else. And it also has other stuff in jazz, rock & pop. Do not miss this little humble shrine.<//text>

This is a San Francisco institution and one of the few record shops in the country that specializes in 45s. The owner, Dick Vivian, knows his trade and handles his customers with poise and wit.</Text>

<Rate>1< /Rate><Review>Tried going there twice over the past week and wasn't open both times... just to give you context, I had to take the Caltrain to 22nd Street from Burlingame, and then take a pool cab or walk from the station to this record store. A plan like that is quite time consuming and requires clear planning.

But, despite me doing all of said planning, the store wasn't open on both occasions. Moreover, I went at 5.30PM the first time, and when I saw that it was closed, I thought 'Hey maybe they just shut shop a bit earlier today. That's alright... they have a life too'

But then I tried again a second time...this time at 3.00PM. After a long walk, mind you. I had planned my whole day around visiting this record store, in fact. But surprise surprise, it was closed. At 3 PM on a Thursday. Clearly they have their own personal interests ahead of business / customer service.

I'm thoroughly tired and disappointed.

I would NOT recommend that you go here unless you call ahead and confirm that it's open.

It seems to me, to be an operation run by real Rookies.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

Dick helped me find Bill Doggett and other great honky tonk stuff from the 60s. Could have spent hours in the store. There are listening stations, the prices are reasonable, and the selection is for real. This place specializes in Motown, funk, soul, and rhythm & blues, etc.</text>

Someone (forgot who) gave me a funky Turtles 45 for $10 when it was almost closing time. Buzz Saw b/w You Showed Me by The Turtles. I also got a soul ballad 45 in mint condition. Nothin' Goin On but the Rent b/w Endless Streams by Kenny Carter. This store has good 45s section organized by artists, new arrivals, labels, and reissues.

Living here is pretty good. The maintenance team is top notch. My only real issues that I have are the apartment management team.
1. They’re never on the same page with anything, with communication being non-existent.
2. Christina Mendoza the assistant manager doesn’t know California laws in regards to return of deposits upon move-out when residents depart the apartment dwelling damage free and clean.

The Reserve at Chino Hills will attempt to take a portion of your rental deposit upon move-out stating it’s in the lease (it is not) as well as refrain from issuing tenants an itemized copy of said funds withheld, as California Civil Code requires.

Advice to people moving in. Take pictures and document your apartment. Upon moving into mine, there were many things damaged and/or that did not work. (Maintenance fixed it fast). Furthermore, find yourself a good attorney that will work on contingency to take places like Decron Properties to court for their wrongdoings. I found a good one out of the Los Angeles area.

Overall though, I really enjoy the neighborhood and the complex in general. Just wish they had more employees that worked there whom actually work.</text>

Look no further! Guadalupe De La Rosa is the sweetest most helpful leasing consultant ever. She made everything worry free and easy for me. I’m so grateful for the help. I’m so happy.

There is parking in one section that a wall is falling over (which has been that way for YEARS), they’ve literally done nothing besides put pieces of wood to “hold” the wall up. I’ve called and asked about an update and they really don’t have an answer. So with parking already terrible not having a good 6-7 spots unavailable is a huge problem for many.

As always, prompt response to my request and feedback from maintenance guy about other things that need repair/replacement.   My washing machine's agitator comes off during cycles and he said it's broken.  Parts will be ordered for now to temporarily fix it but I will be put on the waitlist for a new washer.

<Review>"Keep up the good work!" - It was my review 5 months ago.

Now we really disappointed with the security system also the management. 24 hours security system doesn't work at all. We got our car parked inside the car port, and someone just broke to our car this morning. We reported it to the local sheriff and they said it happens so many times but the management never took an action. We pay a lot for a living right here, but they've never such a security camera on their own property.<//Review>< Rating>

I used to live here years ago, I am pleased to say this place is looking better then ever. I came in no appointment, was helped  immediately by my leasing consultant Guadalupe! She’s very patient and informative. Made my experience super fast and easy. Thank you so much Guadalupe. You are great. I will be recommending this place. All appliances included. Washer and dryer for a great price!! 👍<//Text>

<Review>I have had nothing but great experiences at Reserve at Chino Hills. The girls in the office have always made time for my questions and have always been there for anything I need. We recently got the pleasure of having Lisa as our Office Manager. She is amazing and is very communicative. Along with an amazing office staff, the maintenance crew is awesome! Our apartment has had a few quirks... what apartment doesn't. Luckily, Reserve has the best maintenance team I have ever had living at an apartment. Most of the time, they come by the same day I send in my request. If it's the evening, they are there the next day. They are always courteous and always fix the problem in a timely manner. The team even puppy proofed my patio after one of my pups managed to make an escape while I was running an errand. These guys are the best, and I thought it was important that they get the cred they deserve. Love this place.<//Review>< pictures>

<Review>Office staff was great!
In particular GUADALUPE.
We applied to live at:
The Reserves at chino hills.
She offered us beverages, seating, and a warm smile. And even candy! It’s was the day after Halloween 🙂
She gave us a great tour and answered allllll our questions. She was swamped when we came in too! But each person that walked into that office. She greeted the same as the last; kindly & attentively.
She’s a real pro! She was accommodating to each tenant & prospective tenants. We just adore her.
She is helping us with our move in as well. She our go to girl!
Thank you Guadalupe!!!

The maintenance crew is amazing. Always friendly, courteous, and efficient.
Mostly my experience living here has been good, except for a couple of instances of unruly neighbors.
The cost of living here is high, and rent raises every year above the cost of living raise,  which makes it hard on people living on a fixed income.
Other than the above listed annoyances, I like living here very much. I have lived here almost 4 years.< /text>

<text>I’ve lived here for 2 years it looks safe,clean,friendly but it’s NOT there are consistent car break ins for the whole time I’ve lived here my car got broken into 3 times. There security is more focused on towing people’s cars due to a max occupancy of cars that forces others to park in others car ports that they don’t utilize or even care to park in, The Reserve community and staff made it obvious that they don’t care or enforce others to use car ports. But while complaints from the residences doesn’t make a difference I do advise you either invest in a whole other carport which costs absurd amount of money or invest in some dash cams for your car because security doesn’t know how to do there job or the RESERVE owners cannot afford it.</text></record></dataset><record>

There have been ups and downs.  The Management and Maintenance teams are great. All are very knowledgeable polite and helpful.
The only reason I gave 1 point for the 3 questions regarding the completion of the work is because the part had to be ordered, and has not come in yet. Once that has happened I'm sure I would change those 1"s to 5"s. The Maintenance guys are amazing.
There have been a couple of times the neighboring residents have not been courteous, and considerate, but you'll find that anywhere.
Overall I am enjoying my residence here, just wish it wasn't so expensive.</Text>

Including my most recent maintenance request I am having some reoccurring plumbing issues. I bit annoying but I trust maintenance staff are doing all they can to help resolve the issue. Other than that, things are good. The improvements that have been done to the property are really nice. And I very happy to see the notice about the smoking. Nice to know the office is on top of things as much as possible.</Text>

<review>Enjoy living here. Apartment is nice, amenities are great. Staff is always helpful. However there is still a problem with inconsiderate residents not picking up after their dog. Dog poop frequently seen left on grass and sidewalk even though signs are clearly posted and bags are provided.<//review>< username>

<text>I called maintenance last night waited two hour a call back and no one called me back. There was a car parked in my port and I was left to park far. When I called back I was told reserved had no contract with a tower and it d have to wait till 9AM the next morning. I called the next morning spoke to a different person and was told whom ever I spoke to the night prior had lied to me and that there is a tower. After that it was resolved quickly. It was just unsatisfying that there was nothing done and I was lied to prior<//text>< username>

Worst experience ever! The receptionist named Guadalupe in the office was the worst help ever! She’s didn’t even greet us when we walked in, didn’t offer no water or a drink, she just said “What can I help you with?” First off, bad customer service , she seemed mad or something, so anyways she told my husband and I that our studio would be on hold for us since we met the requirements; income and credit wise. She made a mistake with my husband’s application social security number ( ITIN) number and our application was denied. She told us several times that she would talk to the corporate manager to help us out with the situation and everything would be fine after it got fixed. So she gave us a call a couple days after and said that they weren’t able to fix the problem. Then she called my husband back and told him that she was going to try again to fix the mistake she made. They kept lying to us and prolonging the application process. It seemed like she didn’t want us to move in. She was very very unhelpful. On top of everything she said to us that hopefully we wouldn’t find another place so we can be residents at their apartments. She not only wasted our time but lied to us all the time while we were trying to move at the beginning of the month of December. Total disappointment! Don’t ever get help with this lady, totally unexperience and unprofessional. Don’t waste your time moving in here. There’s a lot of other great apartments in Chino Hills. Thank God we we’re able to find an apartment in Chino Hills, with other great amenities and price wise so much better and way more professional!< /Text>

<review>The office staff were all very nice and professional. Erica assisted me through the entire process and was very nice and made the whole experience flow smoothly. As far as cleanliness of the unit it needed a thorough sweeping and mopping as the floor where very dirty and soiled, the patio need sweeping and clearing of dead leafs and such. The only issue with fixtures was the bathroom door does close properly due to a badly installed hinge and the stop installed on the door to prevent it from striking the cabinets when fully opened was not positioned to due so and is basically useless in its current location.<//review></record></dataset><record>
<Review>The management staff keep changing the rent price which ends up going                   higher and higher. Especially if you talk to Victoria about something she doesn't really like she immediately give you a listing term and your rent price ascends next month for no reason. They don't care about the residents comments which makes living here uncomfortable. When you go swimming or something like that she will talk to you about how many people your can only have and rules that you have to follow because we have bigger family. When you roam around the apartment like swimming or going to the game room, I feel like she follows you like a shadow which is creepy.  😭</Review><gmap_id>0x80dccd384729d617:0xeb57835ebce1770e<//gmap_id>< Resp>

After you move in, there is no smile on the staff’s face. They are all cold face! It is a suffer for me when I have to go to the office. There are three swimming pools, but millions of people.  One staff lives here , and she will bring more than 20 of her relatives to occupy the pool. Very loud and rude! She is also the coldest face in the office, it seems like that I owe her a lot of money! 70% of the neighbors left here during the period I live here. I haven’t lived here for one year. So, if you just wanna find a place to sleep, it is ok! If you wanna live here for peace and life , it is not a good idea!< /text>

<date>1565020186332< /date><review>We moved in on an exceptionally hot day and our A/C unit did not work. This was extremely disappointing and made it challenging to move in as our unit reached a temperature of 90 degrees. We also were not provided with our parking unit nor mailbox number. I was provided with 2 different parking spot numbers both of which someone was already parked in. I had to call back multiple times to determine the correct parking spot number. I was also advised that our apartment would look just like the model since we were getting the white renovation. This was not the case as the flooring isn’t gray like in the model, but is actually a medium brown. The blinds in the living room and kitchen are different shades of white and cream. Our mirror in the bathroom has a huge black stain on it. For a complex to boast about being a luxury apartment home, I have found nothing luxurious about all of the issues I have had with moving in.</review>< user>

DO NOT MOVE HERE! I've lived here for a year now and I just can't wait to leave. I'm going to be brutally honest with my experience here.
1. THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO PARKING. The parking spaces realistically can only fit little smart cars. If you try parking anywhere but your covered parking you will get your car scratched and dented. They attempted to say they're making new parking but they only repainted over the old parking, which made no difference to the problem. TOWING drives around the property every night, I parked in the fire lane for 15 minutes while I put groceries and my son in the house because there is NEVER any parking. and I come outside to find my car towed. Had to pay $275 to get it back.
2. SECURITY SUCKS. I got my car broken into and when I reported it they didn't even care. They acted like it was normal to get your car broken into. I also saw a homeless man in the trashcan near my unit EVERY morning. When I reported it because I was concerned for the safety of my son, they didn't do anything. The answer I got from the manager was "I have no control more than you do". Then I don't know why you're a manager.
3. THERE ARE ROACHES EVERYWHERE!

4. When I first got my apartment my appliances didn't come until a couple days later. all the grocery shopping I did went to waste. They said they were expecting it to come the day I moved in but it never did. Thats besides the fact that the apartment had so many things that needed to be fixed. There was a huge black stain in the bottom of my toilet. It looked like someone had pooped in it and it stained, except for the stain never came off. I was so embarrassed to have any guests use the restroom. When I asked them to come fix it or replace the toilet they refused to replace it. All they did was scrub it and say that's all they can do. it was so ugly and embarrassing. I was so upset I had to pay rent for something I didn't like.

5. My sink water was brown for a whole day before someone came and fixed it. It makes me wonder where the water is coming from.

6. When it was time for my lease to be over, they failed to remind or mention to me that I had to put a 30 day notice. I called and let them know I was moving way before 30 days of my lease termination and the lady I spoke to said the last day of rent would be August 13. Not until I called again and asked if I can leave the 7th did another girl say I needed to send them a 30 day notice. It was already July 18th so now I have to pay beyond my lease until July 18th. They gained an extra 5 days of rent and tried to say well its on your lease contract. I WAS ON THE PHONE WITH YOU AND YOU FAILED TO MENTION IT. Im not going to remember a year later esp if you made it seem like my lease was over august 13th regardless.

Overall, this was the worst living experience my family has had. Everyone should love where they live and that's why I made sure to be honest to all those who read reviews before moving into a place! they also never answer their phones.</text>

The location is great and the people we lived around were most pleasent. But the incompetence of the management is insufferable. A drain between two apartments constantly flooded with what could only be described as sewage water. This would flood our front porch along with our neighbors. The horrid smell remained in our front yard until WE cleaned it out and still there was not a single explanation. Further, this happened every other week or so.

Secondly, these people made it a point to specify BLACK MOLD. Should we see any when we move in then we should let them know....well, needless to say, it must not have been that important because they never came.

Parking is absolutely tragic and your car is likely bigger than most of the spaces. Hope you have good car insurance.

I've never collected more dog feces under my shoes than I have at this complex. Very little effort was made to combat those dog owners that refused to clean up after themselves.

Now the kicker which about sealed or fate at this complex.  The lady above us committed suicide. My fiance came out to our complex roped off and medical examiners rolling a dead body down the stairs.  NOT ONCE did management approach us or let anyone know what was going on. Not even after the fact. We asked if we could be moved or released from our lease because of the situation. And the corporate answer that came, as you can imagine, forced us to stay there unless we broke the lease.

Well we broke the lease. Sickened by this place we paid every dollar and confirmed 3 times "this is it? No more money is due." Annoyingly they said Yes.  Well, we just found out that we are in collections for exactly 99 dollars because.....well, we don't know because nobody has gotten back to us of course.

If you're desperate move here. If there's a cardboard box near by, I'd take a look at it first- it might be better than Village Crossing.</text>

<Text>My fiance and I love this place. The complex has great amenities like a nice clean gym, pool and club house that has foosball table and pool table. The apartment also comes with washer/dryer, refrigerator, stove, microwave and dishwasher. We have my moms dog once a month over for a weekend while she travels and we 've noticed that this complex is dog friendly which is a plus for dog lovers. They have free doggie waste bags and trash stations for it everywhere. This area of Chino Hills is lovely and it has a lot of different shopping centers and a mall near by. The complex is located right next to the 71 FWY so quick to get to the fwy.

I've seen bad reviews but honestly the only bad thing I can say is that the office management is very lazy sometimes, I've asked for simple questions before and they tell me they will get back to me and they never do. I always have to follow up and when I do they had already forgot about it. They are only quick when it comes to their convenience. For example this past February I forgot to make my payment on time because of the short month and I woke up the next day to an aggressive eviction notice. I knew it was my fault so I payed the late fee with no complaint but wow was that aggressive and I felt like, for being a A+ tenant I would get different treatment. I know at the end of the day that's their job but wanted to share this experience.

The good thing is that the maintenance management is great! You submit a request for maintenance and they come usually the same day to check it out and they are very friendly.

If you are a good tenant you should be fine with this complex. If you are a needy client and need constant communication with the office, you may find yourself very frustrated and upset.

Overall I love this place and been living here for 2 years but will unfortunately move out when my lease is over. The main reason is that I've notice the rent will go up every year and being a A+ tenant means nothing to them when in comes to negotiating last years rate. People have better chance at negotiation when dealing with smaller complexes.<//Text><GmapID>0x80dccd384729d617:0xeb57835ebce1770e<//GmapID>< Pictures>

I leased my Apt in this community for 10 months. Initially I was rushed in to my unit and was never shown the premises ahead of time. I was going to upgrade to a 2 bedroom but I ended up leaving this community in 10 months. You  will notice the main office and pool are are extremely beautiful, but there were many other issues that needed attention within this community. The management will keeps changing the rent, there is a disconnection between maintenance and main office and complaints are ignored.
This is Chino Hills and rents are very high, which is notable, you get what you pay for. Victoria will make your live miserable, once I started to document, take pictures to file complaints about the landscaping ( only the front is pretty), leaking sprinklers causing mud to flow on walkways, cockroaches under every Bar-bq  grills things very quickly turned south with her.
They have kids play area where my 3 year old got injured due to a very large wood plank which was not hoisted to the ground properly, there are a total of six 10 ft long planks that surround the play area and 4 of them were not hoisted to the ground, one of the wood planks rolled on my 3 year old little foot. I had made a request to Management but until the time I had left it was never fixed. After the first 5 months of living here my water pressure turned low,  I asked maintenance to check it and off-course it was ignored. Once I took this information to Decron, a District Manager contacted me and within a month a new GM started working in the office,  it turned out that my water pressure was turned down right from outside my patio wall. Their excuse was that rust may have caused it to turn down on its own.
Within the first 90 days my car was towed from my own parking spot which was approved by the management. Towing company informed me of that, there is a 90 day policy on the leasing agreement which they failed to follow.
Victoria also insisted tenants to pay rent in money order, at one instance she lied to me in her office that online auto pay system does not work for tenants any longer, many neighboring renters were charged law fees at several instances. She would collect the late fee only via cashiers checks.   1 bedroom can hold 3 residents it’s on their lease paper, yet when my 83 year old dad would come visit after my mom’s passing in May 2018, she  started to send threatening email messages.
It took them 4 weeks to replace a refrigerator for my next door neighbor.
There are 2 young ladies in the office, not management, leasing agents, were the only 2 who were compassionate and empathetic throughout this process.
If any other renters have similar problems or issues please contact me by posting a message below or via email.<//Text>

Everything is great except for the ant infestation a few days into moving in causing us to throw away $30 worth of food in the cabinets. The office did send pest control to spray the outside which solved the ant problem but then a couple days ago a giant roach was on the side of my fridge hanging on the oven mitts. The parking is ridiculous, the spaces are so tiny that it's near impossible to fit cars side by side without hitting one another. I checked my car door and there was a red scratch on the door clearly from the red car next to me. Your only option is to park super far away to get normal sized parking spaces or park in your carport. Honestly if they just remade the parking space lines to be a realistic size for cars including trucks, it would be significantly better. While there might be less parking available, at least your car wont be scratched and personally I would rather walk super far instead of having my car scratched.</text>

Just read all the TRUE REVEIWS. I am praying that i can break my lease and move out by the first. I started renting here in aug and no no no no no no. I have not had good experiance either. Dishwasher still to this day does not work .Management quick to add on money you owe them but yet i brought up that there is water damage to the maintance and sure enough it is said to be built up paint but now you can see the flooding by the wall in question water pressure and temp is not consistant . My unit was so dirty and disgusting when i moved in mainly floors and frigde . The a c sets to heater(86°) after a few hrs of a c being on. The person who came ti check it put said i cant set my a c too low because it will freeze the pipes and only let out hot air (um where has that EVER happened ?) I mean erika is really nice and professional. There are some good things here but honestly. Changes and possibly better upkeep? The gardener always cuts thing and instead if picking it up he blows it in to the grass so no one can tell. I still have dead leaves and trash in the little garden areas and cobwebs with a big spider on the light post. Just kinda waiting to see how long it takes for them to realize things because i can not baby sit some one elses job.I feel like ..... no one cares about me as a resident here  ... like i just bother them because i want my unit to be move in ready and it wasnot. I never get updates about any thing. Just expected to pay rent in full and thats it .😯😓😤😭< /review>

bad customer service,  there was a dead rat/mouse stuck thru the kitchen wall and it took almost a week for some one to come in and clean that. We ask for pest control several times and never showed up. I do not recommend this place. There were a lot of insects too, and roaches!</review>

Only been here for 3 days but they respond to maintenance requests right away. Neighborhood isn't bad. I had some (expensive) Walmart stuff delivered here on Black Friday and they were still at my door a week later! Didn't hear any disruptions during the weekend. Walls aren't that thin between apts so I can blast music. Always parking available at any time of the day. Christina's really on top of her stuff. Really can't beat $1400 for a 1 br with all appliances included..in Chino hills! I have to say though this wasn't my first time renting an apt so I took precautions to the extreme and inspected every inch for defects or pests and took a lot of pictures on the first day. They fixed all the leaks within the same day. Maybe just because I'm new or maybe they're cool idk I'll update review as my stay progresses but so far I love it 😊</review>

Dont answer phones. Management always seems confused. No cellphone reception for tmobile or metro. Literally none. Need to enable wifi calling services. Without it you cant even call 911 literally no reception.
Apartment itself is nice.
But remember how I mentioned you need wifi for your phone, well they refuse to work with cable companies to have a line installed if there isn't already one there.  Since these are 30+ years old apartments that isn't a guarantee.<//Text>

<Review>The price & location to my daughter was excellent.  The room was fairly clean, however the floor was sticky, so bring old socks to wear.  Probably too much soap on the laminate.  The fridge, that we paid more to have, was stuck on a too cold setting and exploded my bright colored sparkling water!  Bring your ear plugs; there is highway noise. Overall, I would stay again due to location.</Review><Name>Hotels.com reviewer< /Name>< GmapID>

We slept well and the room was fairly quiet. The bathroom was clean. There was hair in a couple of places and that completely grosses me out. The manager gave us a discount because we had such a difficult time from going from their hotels. Their staff was really friendly. The sheets didn't feel crisp. Expedia dropped the ball, so I'm glad Motel 6 helped us out, just a little more detail to the sheets, the cleaning.< /Text>

The more popular and obvious locations are not as peaceful as it should. The location draws more folks who are looking for close attractions to the location. I would recommend using some of the other locations Motel 6 has. Many of the more secluded ones are more conducive to having a good nights rest and to not be disturbed. Went to one that was closer to common path and that has proven to be disruptive and didn't get a good nights rest. Overall, Motel 6 is practical and satisfactory.< /review>

Not near anything very cool. Convenience store pretty close. Water pressure? There was none. Wouldve been nice to be forewarned of the roof work they were doing and that it started at 8am. What a rude wake up call.</text>

There were more handicap parking spaces than we usually see. The room was small but completely handicap accessible. The bed however was supposed to be queen but it must've been an rv sized one, it was tiny. The linens were little more than rags and there was mold on the ceiling above the shower.< /text>

We extended our stay and left around 10:30am when we returned at 6pm the maids had went into our room cleaned it out and threw all our food and hygiene away thinking we had checked out. Just returning from a friends memorial service we were not in the mood to deal with this. The front desk  apologized and comped us a room and tried to replaced items lost. .. which made us a lot happier.  Thanks motel 6</Text>

It was disgusting! Roaches! Dirty! They offered to switch my room to the opposite side of the wall! Like that fixes the REALLY bad roach problem! Customer service needs to be educated there as well as the day manager on how to treat guests. Pay $20 more and go across the street!!!!!< /Review>

The room was immaculate, the bathroom had some modernization to it, which was nice, and a colorful coat of paint in the sleeping area. Bed comfy and clean, plus couldn't beat the deal we got. Next time we're in the area, this will be our go-to motel.< /Review>

I was very disappointed in our stay. We stay at Motel 6 quite frequently and have never had any issues. This stay however, especially during the pandemic, was concerning. The cleanliness of the room was very worrisome. Didn't appear to have been swept, there were large pieces of trash under the bed, and under the microwave was disgusting. A few hours after we arrived there was a yellow/brown liquid that that was in the base of the shower (was not there when we arrived). I even killed a cockroach and two earwigs. I'm glad I brought Clorox wipes with me, I disinfected every surface I could find. I always try to give every business the benefit of the doubt, but in these times it just didn't live up to expectations.< /review>

<rating>3<//rating><text>No towels. No soap. Not much in room to miss so those are noticeably missing when housekeeping misses placing the items. Never had that happen. All else seemed fine.
Could have gone without smelling marijuana smoke outside while unloading car. But you know how some gutter-trash don't care about anyone butt themselves.</text><user>105139223849345462081</user></record>

Hotels are clean beds are acceptable no gross odors or visible peculiar stains. Relatively good price nothing fancy overall optimal spot if you wanna have fun but don't want alot of attention. Staff leave you alone won't charge you for smoking just don't ruin the floor or treat it like trash. Be a respectful human and enjoy your time whether it be something promiscuous or just harmless fun.</review>

<Review>First, never trust anything they promise you in advance. They do not live up to anything they promise. Change rooms, change prices, change things impacting your health---its pretty bad. Second, lots of low life stay here. Third, while some of the people working here are okay, the ones that give you the shaft on what they promised you do it with that syrupy sweet voice that makes me sick. Its kind of like a mannequin with a frozen smile that could care less about you.

Other than that, enjoy your stay.<//Review><time>1591415308918<//time>< pics>

MY ONLY SLIGHTLY NEGATIVE COMMENT WOULD BE THAT THE SHOWER AND THE SINK DRAINED VERY SLOWLY.  WE INFORMED FRONT DESK OF THIS ON OUR CHECK OUT.  IT WAS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME TO HAVE THE STAND ALONE SHOWER WITH HAND GRIPS AS I CAN'T CLIMB IN AND OUT OF BATHTUBS.  MY GRANDSON AND I WERE MOST APPRECIATIVE OF THE FACT WE COULD WATCH THE GOLDEN STATE WARRIORS PLAY OFF GAME ON THE TELEVISION.</Review>

<text>Stay away. There were no rooms available at check in time (and I reserved 2). After 1 1/2 hrs one room was ready and was told that the other room would be ready in 15 mins. We are a party of 7 and had to get ready for an event that evening. Needless to say, the second room was not ready by the time we had to leave for the event and left without freshening up and changing clothes!!
When we returned, we opened up the motel room with a terrible order of cigarette smoke even though it was a non smoking room. We had to spray air freshener and that really didn’t make a difference; it still stunk!!  So after it took over an hour and a half to get the room ready, it wasn’t even clean. The floor was dirty, it felt like sand on the floor, there was a shoe under one bed along with dust bunnies and the other one had trash. The towel holder in the bathroom had dead bugs in it; didn’t feel they were clean to use.
Save your money even if it’s free, go somewhere else!!< /text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

I stayed here last year and had a very good experience. This time I stayed  in March and it was not a good experience.  Room was dirty~ Hair on towels and floor dirty!  A homeless man knocked on my door 2 times in the night and I called the front desk in the morning and the man told me I shoulda called in the night I was sleepy and didnt know thr was rules to call. I saw a drug deal go down as I was leaving in the morning.<//review>

Your particular Motel 6 stands taller than the rest of the motels and hotels that I stay at during my frequent travels. I attribute that to the entire wonderful staff at this location. They are all well trained and very personable. This motel is maintained inside and out very well and the entire staff is helpful and courteous from check in to check out!<//Review>

When I registered it was for a queen bed. When we arrived, the desk clerk processed us, and when we opened the door it was a one double bed. I immediately went to front desk and informed the clerk. She then moved us to a room with 2 double beds. Still not what I paid for. We had to accept it as no other rooms available. That night the person in the room above us was having a shouting, stomping, moving things, pounding on the walls. We called the front desk and told the clerk but, nothing was done to remedy the situation.<//review>

<Text>Motel 6 North San Luis Obispo is one of the less expensive motels to stay at except on the weekend they jack up the price. The staff were friendly the maids are friendly everyone seems to get along there. they can stand some improvements it would be nice if there was a hot tub it would be nice if there was a little bit later check out time but all in all it's a good place to stay.<//Text>< pics>

We booked 2 rooms, one of which was smoked in and knowing that my reservation was with kids I would have expected that the staff pay attention to details and not allocate a room for a family with children a smoked room.  I know you can't control people smoking in room but you can air the room or give it to some who are not with children.

The non carpeted rooms looked amazing in the picture until I found hair in the corners indicating that cleaning is not done well.  The management couldn't not even replace an eight dollar toilet seat from home depot; our bathroom had no toilet seat! Mold was growing all over the shower which is usually an easy fix with some bleach and air.  A room for 4 people had only 2 towels.... Bed we're pushed against the wall so no space for anything else.

Worst place I have ever experienced, however I was there for graduation so this was the cheapest option at $200 a night per room.  Knowing how big the Motel 6 brand is I did not expect the price and moreover the issues.  To pay $200 for a dirty room without a toilet seat is what bothers me most. Even the small size was OK.

To top is all off, having a grumpy pregnant women on front desk on the busiest weekend is not a smart move form management, have her do something else instead! I understand that you can not discriminate but you can make a smarter kinder to her decisions.

Won't be recommending nor stying again.</text>

Cheaper than the other Motel 6 across the street! Seems to have nicer rooms than the other one too. The room had its own microwave and refrigerator. It's a little noisy being by the freeway. Plenty of parking. What else can you say it's Motel 6! Get what you pay for... A decent place to stay for a decent price.<//text>

<Text>This was s great place to stay. Most important for me was the cleanliness and the desk staff at check in and check out. The rooms were very clean and fresh and the staff was friendly and welcoming. Location was very easy to get around. This was my first experience with Motel 6 and if the are all like this one, I will definitely be using them more often when I travel. I was surprised that the room had no hair dryer or even a shower cap, but I'll. Ring my own on future trips.</Text><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

After 3 hours driving to get there, we were exhausted and ready to rest.
Well the bedrooms smelled terrible ( smoking + humid).
After change our bedroom, because we saw bunch of curly and gross ( pubic hair ) under the sheets.
The second one was even worst. The same smells and looks like someone has bloody hands and touched the bathroom walls.
You get what you pay for! But that was just disgusting< /text>

Good location for on and off the freeway.  4 miles for Cal Poly and downtown SLO.  The room was not the cleanest.  We were originally placed in a non smoking room that stunk.  They changed us right away, and were apologetic.  The second room smelled much better.  The card key worked once, then didn't work.  I felt in our short stay (2 nights), we were in the office quite a bit!  The office staff we ran into were nice and helpful.  The cleaning staff removed our old soap and didn't replace it with a new soap.  Again another trip to the front office!  No shampoo in the room.  Overall, ok experience.  Don't know that I will stay here again.  Plenty of other accommodations in the area.< /Text>

<text>The staff was amazing. My son and I accidentally booked at the North building and we wanted South. South campus was fully booked. The manager Christine was so nice. She heard my woes and she upgraded our room to a suite. What a beautiful blessing that was. We couldn’t figure out the free WiFi for the PlayStation and I had mentioned it to the front desk on my way out to get food. The young man at the front desk (I wanna say Hector, but I honestly can’t remember his name), came to the room (after he called first) to help my son set up the FREE WiFi. They gave us extra pillows, extra towels and just made a long drive from Los Angeles to San Luis Obispo a very memorable and enjoyable experience. Thank you entire staff at Motel 6 North.</text><Gmap_id>0x80ecf0ce8f23c2cf:0x9829ede04ee2907d<//Gmap_id><pics>None<//pics><userid>101135403837119907824<//userid></record>

<Review>It was just ok.  The ladies over in the motel 6 across the street were rude however.

When I arrived one of the people in my party was having it out with the front office as they were not providing good customer service to him.<//Review>< Pictures>

<Review>Room worked for a quick lay-over.  Road and parking lot noise was a bother.  Lighting on wall behind the bed was not behind the bed...it was way over to the side.  New rounded shower was wonderful.  Plenty of room and no sharp objects to bump-into.  Visible from Hwy. 101, so was easy to find.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None</Response>< gmapID>

This is one of Motel 6's quiet locations. Although it's very convenient to highway 101, the rooms are very quiet. I have stayed three times at this location, and have been very pleased with the rates, the quality of the room, and the courtesy of the front desk staff.<//text>

We stay at Motel 6 quite often and usually, we have quite a nice experience.  That's what keeps us coming back ... but, unfortunately, this time we had a few hick-ups.

1)  WAY TOO EXPENSIVE!!  We usually stay at Motel 6 for budgeting reasons ... this time, the prices were just too high!  Even though there is an event in town, the prices shouldn't be hiked up so very much!
2)  Shower wasn't as clean.  A simple final rinse from the cleaning crew would have been nice.
3)  Water dripping from light above/inside shower.  Was it from the shower upstairs?
4)  Refrigerator didn't work very well.  Just another observation.

Will we go back?  Of course.  And, like I said, we always do -- just, please take my points as strong suggestions.< /text>

So, when I first checked into the room, the floors were a little dirty.  I didn't make a fuss.  I ended up checking out a day early and left mid afternoon.  As I was packing, I noticed that a commemorative lighter I had purchased from a local shop was missing.  I spoke to the manager about it.  He then questioned the head housekeeper since they had cleaned my room earlier that morning.  No lighter.  I didn't loose it... or mistakenly pack it.  It was taken.  I didn't expect the housekeeper to admit taking it since it might have cost them their job... but it just sucked!  If you stay here, secure anything you consider valuable.<//Text>

Staff were nice but room was supposed to be non-smoking and it smelled of smoke so bad we could not sleep. We had to sleep with the fan on and window open in a not so great, loud area and it was cold at night. Also, not as clean as it should have been especially for $235 for 1 Saturday night. Only real positive is it was pet friendly.< /Review>

<rate>4< /rate><Review>All in all it was a pleasant experience after overcoming the first few unfortunate events. I was initially given a room with a water leak in the bathroom ceiling. The second room smelled so badly of smoke (even though I had requested a non-smoking room), I had to ask for a change again on my way out for the evening (the shower floor also looked dirty).  The clerk was very nice, apologized and assigned me to my third room, but forgot to write down the room number. Upon returning to the hotel after a night out, I could not remember my room number exactly-- and tried getting into the wrong room. Of course the key didn't work, so an attendant tried to help me with no success.  We then called the front desk and they were finally able to identify my correct room number and get me situated.  After that, all was well.  The room was clean, didn't smell of smoke, and the bed was comfortable.  I liked the bright, modern decor and the minimal design.  The room did not have a blow dryer, complimentary shampoo, or a coffee pot (coffee was free in the lobby).  Although you could ask for a blow dryer at the reception desk, I didn't know this until I checked out.  I do like this place for a no frills sleep over and next time will be better prepared. The staff were super-friendly and fortunately able to have back-up rooms for my situation despite a really busy open house weekend at Cal Poly.< /Review>< Pics>

We stayed at the motel 6 on 1433 Calle Joaquin in San Luis Obispo this past weekend.  Our first room had a brown sticky bad smelling substance on the sheets.  See picture. And the 2nd room we were moved to, was filthy.  My husband also found a bug in the towel he was trying his face with.  After multiple attempts, we spoke to the manager.  She blew us off.  Even told us not to bother calling corporate because they would send it back to her.  I think the hotel needs to be checked out for cleanliness.  It was just gross overall.
I need to know who to contact as I want a refund on our room.  The manager first offered 50% back, then changed it to 30%.   She told us if we want more back we have to call Wednesday and speak to the general manager.  At this point it like to speak to someone higher up.</Text>

The staff was so helpful.  It was a crazy weekend (SLO graduation) yet the coffee was wonderful - the iron was new, they were kind and accommodating!  Thank you so much for making our stay terrific.  I had three rooms.

Plus the management understands that everyone is working hard to be financially responsible.<//text>

I thought the front desk lady was nice and checking in went smoothly. The rooms were clean! But the man who was doing housekeeping kept trying to come into my room before checkout. The first time he knocked early in the morning and we told him that we aren’t leaving until noon, then when I went to go get breakfast the cleaning guy walked into my room without knocking and my suitemate was in there. Other than that I paid a good price for a last minute trip.<//review>

Great location, and friendly staff but the room was not as clean as we expected it to be. There were cigarette burns on the blanket, hairs on the bed sheet. The room also smelled like cigarette even though it was a non-smoking room. I will probably book a hotel nearby if I come back to the area again.</Text>

<review>I was so tired when I got there very sticky floors dirty, I go notify the front desk for asking when I got there I had just got there my daughter was in the shower and they said I could switch rooms to upstairs only thing is I was going to be able to carry on this stuff upstairs I was not feeling well not only exhaustion I had medical issues going on, they said they couldn't enter the room with it being occupied so I asked if I could mop it myself they said sure but they only use a dry mop and spray bottle that's how they clean their floors that's really gross this is the coronavirus x everything I wiped I didn't even use that mop because it just wasn't going to be enough everything I wiped was filthy dirty it's not a safe place to stay you can hear everything feels like someone's watching you no privacy no peace of mind doesn't feel homey I mean it's not an expensive hotel but it's not the cheapest and for the price you should at least get cleanliness there was no blanket it was just very uncomfortable and dirty and no matter how much I clean the floor I went through like 6 bath towels to clean it it was still filthy.< /review>< Pictures>

< Review>
When driving in rate says 55.99 but I was charged online fir 82.00 for 1 adult and 2 children. My family and I use motel 6 slot and you can usually get the room cheaper online but calling the 800 number I was charged 20 dollars more than usual. Over all they are usually good but I suggest when customers call and say the posted night rate says 55.99 you honor what you have posted regardless of whether you say you are full you still advertised 55.99...not happy this time around.<//Review>

Mattress was worn down on side closest to the door, felt like I was going to fall off.  Otherwise, the room was great, very clean and the staff was friendly and attentive.  Strange odor in the room with the vending machines and ice maker.< /review>

Service was nice. The key system was wonky at times had to get keys reactivated. Overall nice rooms for the price. Location a little out of the way but close to the freeway. There are two on the same street just the opposite sides of the main street.</Review>

I had a one night stay , the front desk lady wasn't rude but just looked like she didn't want to be there . Which I've stayed here before a few times but it's been a while and before front desk was for the most part really friendly and welcoming. The room were clean and smelled good. Oh and at some time at night I get a knock on the door saying front desk (actually a bang) got a little scared so it took me a while so had the safety lock and open it just a little bit no one was there , I was so tired and sleeping that I just went back to sleep and never called front desk to see if it was them and what did they need . Si overall it was okay.</Review>

When I stayed here it was clean and comfortable. Does not have landscape like the one up the street but its clean. The repair man helped me open my window polite. Close to downtown cost $12 to uber there. Check out time is now 11am and that's ok but I didn't know it. I would stay here again< /Review>

<Rate>2</Rate><review>We have a family member who use to work for Motel 6, and he took great pride in doing a good job.  His Motel 6 is still very clean and well kept.  I checked in and first thing I noticed was that the floors were not clean.  Their was hair and other dirt all along the edges of the bathroom, under the beds hadn't been cleaned for ages and there was a thick layer of filth.  The drain in the bathroom sink couldn't drain because of debris obstructing it.  The toilet seat was loose so it played slip and slide when you sat on it and it will break loose at some point and you better hope it isn't someone who will end up on the floor with an injury.  The otherwise white shower stall showed evidence of pink slime.  There were 2 of us checked in, but only towels for one.  I asked for another at the front desk but was told they couldn't assist me with that.  During the night, someone vomited in one of the stairwells, and I had to use an alternative route around it.  when I checked out 6 hours later it was still there even after notifying staff. The concrete surfaces are in need of a power wash, and even the doormats are filthy. We had just spent the previous nights at a different Motel 6 on our route that was well maintained and clean.  This site is an outlier and in need of remedial action.  Certainly not worth what I paid for it in comparison to the rates at other motels in the area.< /review>< Pics>

The staff was friendly and accommodating with allowing a late check out, however when it comes to the room it’s another story. There were ants in the bathroom and on the ceiling in the main room. The tv did not display any content when scrolling through the channels, and the sheets had stains and crumbs on it. All and all it did the job but not worth the price I had paid.<//text>

The young man who was doing the cleaning was overwhelmed so it wasn't his fault that he never made it to our room.  Also, in his defense, he promptly took out our garbage, gave us clean towels, and tidied up a bit as we were coming back from a very long day.  We left at 5am each day and when we returned at 6pm, nothing had been done in our room.  When I told the Indian lady when I checked out, she smiled to add insult to injury.  I have stayed at this location several times before, but never again.  Understaffing and charging that much for accomodations is not acceptable.</text>< gmap_id>

<text>The Good: Clean room, very comfortable bed with nice pillows and bedding as well. Nice TV, although a local news channel would be good.

The Bad: something buzzed or vibrated, loudly, in the wall that separated the main room from the bathroom. If you touched the wall, you could feel the wall vibrating. I'm guessing it might be a recirculating hot water pipe? It happened one night at 4 a.m., and the next night from 10 p.m to about midnight. I mentioned it to the desk clerk / manager when I checked out.

One other gripe was the weekend room rate jumping up an extra $90 per night. I recognize its summer in a popular place, but more than doubling the room rate seemed excessive and makes the place not the usual good deal. On another weekend visit, I'd be seriously tempted to consider another hotel.<//text><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None</response>< Gmap_id>

So I definitely love that this is a dog friendly motel aaaand I think that's just about all that I loved about it. I realize motel 6 is nothing fancy and it's very basic and that's really all I needed however there are super sketchy people everywhere and when I took my dog to go to the bathroom I saw a tweeker getting banged out by some dude and what I think was the laundry area... So I think I'm good on staying here again. Dont recommend.<//Review>

We were pleasantly surprised at this Motel 6.  It was basic, but very clean with a nice bathroom & lots of clean towels.  We had our 2 small dogs with us and there was no problem with them at all.  There was a grassy area for them to walk on to do their business in the back of the motel.  Everyone working there was very pleasant.  For the price, we were very happy.< /review>

My room was booked next to my 75yr old mom & 85yr old dad. However, an hour before I arrived my room was given to someone else. I had to stay around the corner in room 129. My room was dirty. Go in the bathroom & shut the door,(there is muddy marks on the back of the door.) My sheets weren't changed daily & the room smelled musty. For as much as I paid, I should have had a clean room & clean sheets. Also, my room shouldn't have been given to someone else because my flight was an hour late.<//text>

It took close to twenty minutes to get our keys for each room. I asked for non smoking and we ended up having to take smoking rooms because none of the other rooms were cleaned. So we that we were good once we got to the room but they ended up giving us a dirty room, so we had to go back down and get another one.
We weren't looking for much but a comfy bed and clean room to sleep but it didn't turn out that way at all. Location was fine, no surprises. But check-in was way too long.</Review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

The prices were reasonable and they had a room for the entire requested time of my stay. The staff was super friendly, and we had a regular house keeper that stopped by once or twice a day to make sure we had enough towels. He was very accommodating, and knew that my kids would need more towels coming back from the beach. Overall, very friendly and never intrusive.<//review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

<Review>Everything was perfect we were treated very well and was extremely pet friendly. It would have been a perfect stay except the little hispanic guy mocking me for being retired from the military.  Shame on you guys to let something like that happen to a military retiree. I stay at motel 6 all over the state and I've never been so humiliated in my life.< /Review>< pictures>

Friendly staff when we arrived. Housekeeper was very nice. Wood like floors. Clean towels and Sheets. Room next door was a little noisy but called the front desk and they must have taken care of it because it stopped. Friendly staff when we checked out and  coffee at front desk. Pleasant surprise overall for our 2 night stay.< /text>

The room had an awful smell, you could barely breathe. Everything was dirty, the bed was wrinkled and had hair all over the sheet, the bathroom was dirty, on the floor was so much filth, that we had to shower with our flip flops, but the receptionist was really nice and helpful.</text>

This motel ripped us off.  They charged my grandaughter for two rooms for the same night.  When asked why they said that was their holiday price.  Our receipt clearly shows they charged for two rooms.  My room was only 92 for a double, hers was 153 for a single. Rooms smelled, bedding was not clean.  This is a NO star place, but it won't let you post if you don't  give it one< /text>

Pretty much a standard roadside motel.

Good location, rooms away from the highway are quiet.

Clean, decent, safe and sanitary.

Weakest coffee I've ever seen. No "Do Not Disturb" signs.

Soap only in bathroom - bring your own hair products etc.</review>

The room was decent. It was clean and had the micro-fridge as advertised. This is a no-frills kinda place. There is wifi but only if you pay extra for it. They didn't have extra pillows or blankets, stating they had "run out", which is possible since the place was pretty full. I'd only stay here again if it was the only place with rooms available, which is why I stayed here in the first place. Not bad, not great, but much better than sleeping in my car.<//Text>

The front desk staff were very friendly and accommodating, but that's where the good ends. The price was $113 for a Saturday night stay booked in advance - that's expensive for a motel, but super expensive for how dirty and uncomfortable this room was.

The room was neatly made up, but it had clearly not been cleaned properly. The floor was disgustingly dirty - we didn't realize just how bad it was until we took our shoes and socks off to shower (picture attached) - the hardwood floor felt like it hadn't been swept or mopped in months.

The shower was dirty, with hair in the drain and recent dirt stains (not the permanent kind, the kind you can wipe off with a rag). The towels had multiple stains and were so rough it was clear their usefulness as towels had long passed.

There was a roach under my son's bed - roaches don't bother me that much, but they really bothered my young son, who almost didn't want to sleep in the room any more. That was a hassle I definitely didn't want to deal with.

The parking lot had a lot of trash and debris and the pool area looked like it hadn't been cleaned in awhile.

Finally, they offered kids lollipops in the registration office, but I took a look at the container and the lollipops all looked like they had had their wrappers removed and then re-wrapped. One of them was put back in with no wrapper at all! (picture attached).

Overall, this Motel 6 is much dirtier and more uncomfortable to stay in that most Motel 6s I've been in, especially when you consider it's in San Luis Obispo, which is a beautiful town. Not worth the money. Spend another $20 or $30 and book at an actual hotel.</Review>

Our stay was predictably nice, no problems with staff, cleanliness, coffee, etc.
Except for one thing: The towels are kept in a yellow box hanging on the wall, with holes in it for towels. The bottom part of each cubby was dusty when I came in - didn't check the 2nd day.<//Review>

Positive- the air conditioner worked, the morning coffee was good and the front office staff friendly.</text>< pics>

<rate>3<//rate><text>Positives: Front desk staff were extremely friendly. We only visited with them to check in and out.
No frills - sometimes they have a refrigerator which would have been nice. Only issues:
AC: when on - was freezing for the bed right up against the AC.
Window: didn't open - we probably wouldn't have used the AC if the window would have opened.
Neighbor Sat & Sun night left the TV on loud all night. Finally called him 2nd night around 4am after not being able to get back to sleep for about an hour - had to call twice (1st time he didn't answer, just hung up) but he did turn it off. When I mentioned this to the front desk staff at 5:30 when we checked out, they were extremely apologetic and told us we should have called them - that they would have handled it 1 way or the other.
Price: Rooms in this town on Memorial Day are pricey. Most other hotels were much more. Still...at $140 a night (for a Motel 6?) + tax would have like a refrigerator.</text><pics>None</pics><Response>{'time': 1497029105305, 'text': "Dear Dale, Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback and recognizing our friendly staff.

We paid $590 for 2 nights. That is more than we normally pay but it was all we could find because of graduation ceremonies. We walked into room and first impression was a dirty bed spread with big stains all over it. There were 2 dirty towels in the bathroom.
Our experience with Motel 6 has been very positive in the past. And at other locations.
We probably won’t return to this location.<//text>

<Text>The Motel 6 in San Luis Obispo is located on Calle Joaquin and is in sort of an out-of-the-way place but it's quiet there so that's a plus. The rooms themselves are clean but they are kind of dated and they little maintenance. The card key system for the door locks is Goofy and should be replaced. There is a convenience store close by and Margie's Diner is just down the way which is a good place to eat. In general it is a very good economical place to stay in my books there is a pool but it doesn't get used too​ much it is clean though.< /Text>< pictures>

<Text>The front desk check in employee was fabulous. Very positive and easy going. The site is well lit - with a car dealership next door. Did I mention the lights?  The black-out curtains in the room work - Yeah.  The room was clean and minimal. Another blanket available would have been nice. By the time I realized I wanted one, it was late and the fire dept. police, ambulance was on premises for a hotel guest so I stayed put and wore a sweatshirt to bed. Got settled in and turned on the T.V. only to find many streaks of color on the picture tube. The audio/visual would delay as well. Kind of a stop and start happening. I changed channels to see if would improve, but it was like this throughout each channel. I turned it off and on to see if this would help. Naaaa.  So read my book and went to bed. Woke up to the car dealership washing their vehicles and the employees loudly talking to each other near by the fence which separates the property.  Shower was clean and water was warm.<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None<//Response><GmapID>0x80ecf0ce8f23c2cf:0x9829ede04ee2907d< /GmapID></record>

<text>The service especially at the front counter was very very good. The front counter personnel were very helpful when I asked for help. The room was clean. Sometime during the early morning hours some people in one of the adjoining rooms were having a very expressive and audible sexual experience. I had two other reservations in different Motel 6 locations that weekend which were very very good so I hate to complain about this one instance but would mention it if telling other people about the stay in San Luis Obispo.<//text></record></dataset><record>

For the middle of October, I felt the daily rate was outrageously high.  One bed for one person should not cost over $100.  No carpeting, no decor, shower only, this is supposed to be economical.  It is not, and I will re-consider future plans to stay at Motel 6.</text>

< Review>
The check in service was fine but not good enough to raise it over one star because the Room was horrible And just disgusting.  The bed was so uncomfortable The floors were dirty the bathroom was moldy the shower leaked everywhere and the freeway traffic noise was obnoxious.  Even poor people who can only afford $75 a night should not have to stay in accommodations this awful.  I would not recommend this motel to my worst enemy. I think the president of Motel 6 should have the experience of staying there. You would think that such a rich city like SLO would have higher standards.  I have stayed in a lot of the renovated motel 6 locations on the west coast and this was by far the worst.< /Review>

<text>Having stayed at motel 6, many times in past years , I was disappointed at the condition at this location. 1) no toilet tissue 2) cigarette burn on bed spread 3) dirty floor 4) mosquitos in the room. On the positive side, a young man in the office, was helpful in directing me to Costco for a delicious salad for my dinner, I am so pleased that I am able to travel with my small, well behaved, poodle and stay with her at Motel 6. On my way to AZ, I spent the night in Blythe, CA, at Donlon St, 92225. Everything was delightful, there, in every way. See want them to be properly complimented.  Thank you!

6 of us arrived & all six were told at different times that there were no 1 bed rooms cleaned & we could get a 2 bed room for more money. This was 6pm. All of us had confirmation numbers for 1 Queen bed rooms.
They said i had not pick the bed choice, yet i also had a confirmation number for my room & 1 single queen bed.
Seemed very fishy & unprofessional. All of us got 1 bed rooms after we protested . The rest of the motel was just fine.< /review>

My experience here wasn't as great as I expected. The bed was made very nicely, but as I uncovered it I quickly realized that the bed was full of hair. Motel 6 should definitely wash the sheets after every person, instead of every 3 days! I am very dissatisfied with the cleanliness of this motel!!</text>

Staff was awesome and everything was what you’d expect from a Motel 6. My only complaint would be the cockroach roaming around the counter next to the tv & ice bucket in our room when we first arrived.< /Text>

<Text>When I checked in, I was informed that the rate I had booked the room for had changed and that when you make a reservation you are reserving the room, not the rate. That's never happened to me before anywhere in the US or the world as I've traveled. They stated it was because it was Presidents Day weekend and there was a storm. I had booked the rooms weeks in advance and chose this place only because of the cheap price. Needless to say I won't be staying at this Motel 6 or any others ever again. I did not get what I paid for; for the price I paid, I could have stayed somewhere else.< /Text>< Pics>

I brought my son to San Luis Obispo so he could check into Cal Poly the next morning to begin WOW there at the college. When we arrived at Motel 6 on Friday, we had to wait some time due to  several ahead of us also checking in. There was a strong cigarette smell in and around the office. The office staff were friendly and kind. When we did go to our room, it was very basic, accutally too basic for us. The room had no shampoo, only very small soaps (hardly big enough for two people), and no coffee pot. All it had was two beds and a small TV set. This might be normal for a Motel 6, but for $136 per night, I expected a little more. Also, the rooms had very thin walls and we could hear a lot of noise coming from other rooms above and near us.< /Text>

I had a wonderful stay at Motel 6 in San Luis Obispo (North); the amenities were basic but clean, and the rooms were serviced every day and kept very neat by the housekeeping staff.

What made this stay so memorable however, was Jeramie Gaines going ABOVE AND BEYOND. Whether it was me deactivating my keycard (multiple times, accidentally) and him helping me each time, to him giving us tips on where to eat locally, Jeramie made our stay incredibly pleasant. Each time we walked by the front office, he waved and said hello, and he did everything in his power to make sure that we were as comfortable as possible.

Though there are more expensive hotels in SLO, I have to say, I would probably choose to stay at Motel 6 again: the experience was incredibly pleasant, easy, and Jeramie made the entire process an absolute breeze.< /Text>

Although the location is great and the price is, well, affordable, the front desk agents need to be trained in the customer service aspect. When I arrived to check in, the gentleman at the front desk, with a baseball cap and plaid shirt on, was having a conversation with another guest, of other things not relevant to her stay. Not until about 5 minutes later and hinting at him by looking at my watch, did he say, "where is she, we are trying to see if we have any rooms". Good thing I made a reservation.

The room was just ok. The shower definitely needed some deep cleaning...almost didn't want to shower. "Fresh" towels had long hairs in them, bed sheet was stained.

Would think twice of staying there again.<//Text>

The front office staff were super nice people.  However, I didn't find the room to be very clean.  The floor was dirty.  The towels were very old and worn.  The ice machine wasn't working. The shower wasn't any bigger than a shower stall in a small RV.   It was just ok but I wouldn't recommend it unless you really needed someplace in a pinch.  We've stayed at better motels/hotels for less expensive and closer to the beach than the price of this place.<//review>

<Review>I always enjoy the value I get staying at Motel 6.  They have great locations, almost always located close to where I want / need to be.  The location was a particularly reasonable priced motel.  The room was comfortable and clean and I had a guaranteed room from an online reservation even though I arrived late.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

<text>Although the staff was very nice the rooms were very small. The towels smelt really bad, the shower drain was nasty and who knows what was on the bathroom walls and doors (boogers?) The beds were not bad, I always bring my own pillow. I'd stay here again but ONLY if I couldn't find a better choice. The Motel 6 across the way is much better.</text><pics>None< /pics><date>1499275285198</date><user_id>114003065802110907130<//user_id>< resp>

I booked my stay same day while on a road trip. I'm glad there was room and happy to get a fairly reasonable rate for a room. The woman at the front desk was short mannered with a new employee, I felt sorry for him. Very disappointed when I walked into my initial room that reeked of cigarette smell. When called front desk to be moved, they said they would only be able to move me if I did not use anything in the room. This is ridiculous and poor customer service. What if someone is pregnant, allergic, or has asthma? Anyone should be moved in a situation like this, regardless of if they use anything in the room. Luckily for me (I guess) I did not use anything and they moved me. When at the front desk, the woman said my room was supposed to be non-smoking, but people do it anyway. Wow, thank you. I found hairs in the bed and on each towel. The towels had stains. i really wish I didn't shower there. Maybe my standards are too high? In the morning, my second room began to smell of cigarettes coming from the bathroom vent. The person at the front desk assured me they will spray in the room, a band-aid to their issue. Something is extremely wrong if your motel continuously smells like cigarettes in non-smoking rooms.< /text>

<Review>Unfortunately this was not a good stay. Location was excellent though. For one when we arrived there was no rooms available. We arrived after check in time,  housekeeping did not change our bedding, they knocked on our door early before check out time we were sleeping n got woke up, it was very loud at night, staff was not friendly, we needed more towels for showers they were hard to get,  bathroom showerhead leaks and sprays all over, for as much as we paid it skunks of been a better stay! Will not go back.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

<review>Rooms were clean didn't smell like smoke the only thing that they need is comfortable mattresses a little bit more firm.
Our second stay on June 14th 2018 was a total nightmare! I will never recommend this hotel to anybody.< /review><Pics>None</Pics>< Rating>

I can't believe out of all the rooms this Motel had available I had the horrible experience of having someone upstairs that dropped things, slid the chair across the room and was extremely loud. Thank goodness I always carry ear plugs.
But, how inconsiderate of you, I will not recommend you and if you have a Facebook page I will also put this comment on it.
Google is even better!!
Will I stay there again, NO!!<//text>

<time>1497114670514< /time><rate>4< /rate><text>We stayed here for one night and had a good night's sleep, thanks to the front office staff who were able to find us a quiet room (we are seniors). At first we were given a room that was not ready but this was quickly and efficiently resolved by the ladies in the front office. The new room was very nice and clean. There was some spilled coffee-like substance near the sink and we had to use a couple of small towels to clean it up--besides this the place was spic and span, and the beds comfy. Plenty of ice for the hot weather. SLO is just a short drive away (our destination) and there are also some grocery stores and eateries close by. Would stay here again.</text>< pictures>

For the price we paid, it was not very good.  I have stayed at other motel 6 and have had a better price.  Usually it is about 80 dollars not $200 a night.  I was really dissatisfied with the price and it did not even come with any continental breakfast or any breakfast.  The double beds were very uncomfortable. For 60-80 dollars a night i can understand this but not for $200 a night.</Text>

<Text>People at front desk though nice not knowledgeable in using you computer system, we reserved 12 rooms through your group reservation, who did a great job , it took awhile for this lady  at the front desk to find it, she also canceled one of our rooms with double beds, and one of the families in our party (father-daughter) ended with a one bed room, then the rooms were not cleaned right, rooms were small for the price, just not the place we will pick next time we'll come to town.</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

The location of the motel was good, the room and beds were very uncomfortable. The room stunk of ciggerettes as you walked in, the beds felt like sleeping on springs. The floor in the shower was cracked open and one of the towels on the rack was dirty. We were supposed to stay 2 nights and ended up checking out early due to the beds being so uncomfortable that it was hard to sleep. I will never stay at this location again.</text>

My sister and I stayed at Motel 6.  We have never experienced such a horrible hotel stay in our life.  First, all non-smoking rooms were taken, so we had to stay in a smoking room the first night.  My sister is highly allergic and had some reaction to the smell of the smoke in the room.  The hotel clerk tried to accommodate our stay and moved us into a non-smoking room for our 2nd night.  This room was extremely dirty!  The floor was so dirty that we could not walk around without shoes on.  Both of our beds had a bunch of hair on the sheets and pillow cases.  The bathroom towels has a huge hair clump on one and the other towels were covered in stains.  To top it all off, our toilet kept clogging and the front desk made us plunge our own toilet!!!  They brought us a plunger and said that they do not have maintenance!  I have never stayed anywhere and had to plunge my own toilet.  Finally, there were 2 hoodlums standing outside our hotel room smoking marijuana.  The manager was nice to refund us for 1 night, but I'm still not satisfied.  I believe that both nights should be comped.  I will never stay at a hotel 6 ever again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Very disappointing.< /Review>

This was the 2nd Motel 6 I have stayed at & the one in San Luis Obispo (north) definitely gave the other one I stayed at a run for its money! The rooms are updated, nicely decorated, with a surprisingly amazing bathroom! Definitely couldn't tell I only paid $280 for 4 nights! The location is wonderful. You are just minutes from the beach & other attractions.<//Text>

<Review>I went here thinking ok just gonna rest my head.. wanted something inexpensive. so yes I got inexpensive and I got good reception from the girl at the front desk. My room had wood floors. I feel like it was cleaner than a Hotel I paid for up the street which was more expensive. Basic room but so happy for the price and the way I was treated. Only thing was it was a little far away from downtown so I had to Uber back after dinner and drinks but that was only $10 there and back. I will use this place again if I need a motel in San Luis Obispo</Review>< gmapID>

No clock or kleenex in room, so bring your own. Coffee in lobby, not room. No continental breakfast, but again the price was reasonable and a great breakfast restaurant across the street.
Also, door key did not work. I had to call the office twice. They said they would check the electronics after I checked out.

<review>Place was super dirty. And then there was dirt vomit and body fluids on the wall sheets and mattress review. They switched this rooms and got upset with us saying we didn't give them enough time to clean that room and they weren't done cleaning it yet even though they had set it up like it was. Getting dirty looks from the staff because we move don't feel comfortable here would not stay here ever.

The updated rooms are super nice. I like how the shower was situated too because hotel shower curtains can get really gross and being behind the shower head was a great design idea. The only reason it's not 5 stars is because I'm a residential house cleaner and I definitely don't envy some of the gross things I'm guessing people leave behind in hotel rooms but there are little things here and there. Target sells these awesome microfiber dusters I would recommend. Just to sweep it over the tops of things like the light fixture in the bathroom or any edges by the stand, the cubby holds for towels in the bathroom things like that. I love the new floor vs old carpet but cleaning under the bed shouldn't take that long. I get it I hate cleaning under beds but I'm sure most people check to make sure they didn't leave anything behind. And I would recommend standing in the shower and closing the curtain because my shower curtain had a blood stain on it. Lots of little minor things I'm sure a lot of people don't notice but for the ones that do it would make so much difference and maybe take an extra 15 mins tops. Other than that the place was awesome the people at the desk were super friendly.

<Review>Two issues:

1) TV in the was not functional all the time. The office told us that the signal was too weak.

2) At time of booking I was told on the phone that the last night Sat to Sunday was at about $180 +13%tax. I had booked 3 nights and had decided to check out a day early. Instead of getting the promised refund I got $183 refunded. They said that this is what the computer is telling them, no capability to give me further explanations.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None</response>< GmapID>

<review>Stayed at motel 6 in San Luis Obispo. Our room was smoke free. It was pretty clean. But I probably will not stay again. The bed spreads were not very clean. They had stains or dirt on them. Not very inviting if you ask me.< /review><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None<//resp><gmapID>0x80ecf0ce8f23c2cf:0x9829ede04ee2907d<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

I was really disappointed with our stay. The bedspreads were dirty; one had what appeared to be bowel skid marks. One of the towels in the bathroom had long blond hair stuck to it and it was a filthy towel. My guess is that the towels were not changed.  I had to go back to the office and ask for replacement towels. The nightstand was not wiped down, sticky residue was left behind. The room smelled of cigarette smoke as well. Will never go back to this place!</Text>

Charged us $18 for a second person in the room. Rooms smell of lemon cleaner.. very pungent but I guess at least they are cleanish. Bed is old and squeaky (without any shenanigans happening) ;).   No carpet in the room which is nice. Rooms are small but the staff were accommodating and polite. Ok for a cheap room but next time i would pay the$50 extra for a better room.<//text>

<Review>This location was quiet as I always hope. The bed was adequate and I slept well; a touch lumpy. Towels and soap are Motel 6 quality and in saying so I always wonder how much more I would need to pay for a higher quality. Wi-Fi is free most places and to charge is an example of being overly frugal.
Charge $5.00 to $10.00 more and provide a better quality.</Review>< user_name>

<Review>Not realizing it was Cal Poly's Homecoming the weekend we had a difficult finding any vacancy within a 25 mile radius, unless we were willing to spend almost $500 a night. All hotels/motels raised rates double and triple their normal price. More then we would normally spend on a Motel but since options were limited, we booked and we luckily found this gem. It was clean, comfortable and had a simple yet fun renovation. I will admit, we were hesitant because of some previous Motel 6 stays at other locations but we will be back here again if we need a room in the SLO area. Great job with running and decorating this location.<//Review>< pics>

Room was clean, everything inside worked, staff was friendly, however  person at front desk made mistake, it was about 5 hours after we was in our room, two guests used they key card and was able to enter our room, (right after me and my wife just finished taking a shower,) . My wife was freaked out by it. It seems the front desk did not know it was already occupied and was given to new guests.  So my wife decided to sleep in her clothes out of fear of someone else might come inside, even though we latched and dead-bolted the door. She was paranoid. We were also afraid to leave our stuff in our room when we went out. Motel 6 should have a better system to track which room is taken already.<//Text>

The rooms are Small and Dirty.
The mattresses were old and comfortable at all.
Plus we think that we was bitten by bed begs.
The room was full of dust and we saw some hairs in the sheets. The shower didn't work very well we had something very cold or very hot.
Although The receptionist was very nice he helped us with our luggages and gives us tips about the area aroud.</Text>

I asked to be in a smoke free move, but instead I was put in a room where people were smoking on the stairs on the stairs and there were also cigarette buds every where in the walk way leading up to my room.. People were loitering and starring, which made me feel uncomfortable.. Also, the the bathtub was dirty..</Review><user_id>None< /user_id></record>

Location is fairly easy to find. Just turn off of LOVR toward the Chevron station and keep heading down that street. You will come up on the motel on your left.</Text>

We stayed for multiple nights, when we asked for a discount for one night due to how disgusting dirty the room was,( Wich we took photos when we first walked in the room) we were told no we should have said something right away. But why say something when the mext room is going to be just the same. In the bathroom where there is a hook behind fhe door for your wet towel, there was mold from there constantly being a damp towel hanging there. Besides how dirty the 3 Rooms where that we stayed in, we had a good stay and house keeping was great on our requests for towels and trash bags. But i wasnt happy when i asked for a fridge and microwave and was told because it was after 11am they couldn’t accommodate my request.< /Text>

Easy to get to off the freeway. Great staff checking me in.
They said it was a non-smoking, no pet room, but the room and pillows reeked of cigarette smoke.
It's crazy that they have an ash tray in a non-smoking room, with a non-smoking symbol on the bottom.< /Review>

<review>This was the first time staying at this location. It worked out well as far as the location and the intention of this trip. HOWEVER, for the 2nd night, after being out most of the day, I came back to find that the front desk had put other guests right next door with two very loud, constantly barking dogs. Apparently those guests had left the dogs there while they went out. In contacting the front desk, they said they would contact the guests but had already moved them to this room due to previous complaints. Why the motel would move them beside someone else, in this case me, and continue the problem is concerning. One, as the motel wasn't very full and these guests could have at least been moved and isolated more so this problem would not bother anyone else.

As it was not known when these guests would be back, and as constant and irritating as the barking was, I chose to move to another room. I, and most people, could not stand having to deal with this for even five minutes. Not only did I have to move, which involved moving my cats and all their stuff as well, but was doing it on an injured foot which compounded the issue.

I got apologies and a free one night wifi ($3 value). Big deal.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None<//response>< Gmap_id>

<Text>The most terrible experience I've ever had in my life at a motel. They don't even changed the sheets, I found piece of nails on it!
And also the sheets are full of little wholes made by cigarettes.
Completely disgusting!
If you have better choices, don't book at this terrible place, never EVER!
This conditions are totally disrespectful with costumers!< /Text>< pictures>

Only thing I noticed was the bathroom door looked chewed up.  A previous guest must have locked their dog in the bathroom.  The door was then painted over.  Not the fault of Motel 6 that guests are not considerate of their own animals.  Bad pet owners!< /Review>

The room was beyond basic. Two cheap old pillows. No actual furniture just cubby holes. No trash can just a trash bag. No shampoo just a bar of soap.</Review>

You know exactly what you're getting when you stay at Motel 6.  The updated modern rooms are always clean and inviting.  We will always stay at this chain because it allows our doggie to stay with us and the price is right.<//review>

If you're going to hike the rates for grad weekend, everything should be in working order! The outlet in the bathroom didn't work, making it difficult to get ready so early the next morning.  My expectations weren't high but the sheets and towels were so scratchy and gray, looked dirty, I'm offended I had to pay luxury rates for this!</Review>

This place is a little better than the Motel six on the other side of the street. Though, I don't like their policies of non-smoking because they don't enforce it. People still smoke and they don't do anything about it. I didn't feel that safe in the parking lot as well.<//Text>

<Review>I booked this room online with the AARP discount, when I arrived, the clerk told me they didn't accept the discount anymore. She then gave me a smoking room. When I returned and told her this, she assigned me to another room that was occupied. The third room was fine, except the toilet was running, making noise and wasting water. I don't know why she assigned me to a smoking room, or didn't know about my AARP discount. Do they even read the reservation and hold the correct room for you?

I stay at Motel 6 about 10-20 nights per year. I like the value and convenience of a national chain. This experience was below average. I don't think I'll return to this unit again.</Review>< Pics>

<review>we asked for a non-smoking room and when we got to the room, it smelled like smoke. They switched our rooms right away and it didn't smell like smoke. Thanks for the quick change

Also, not sure if the room was cleaned but we found hair on our bed and the shower when we first got there< /review>< Pictures>

The bed was really uncomfortable and the AC unit was not working properly. It kept shutting off and you'd have to press the reset button on the plug to get it to work again. It was also very noisy in the room because of the road noise from the freeway. Considering how expensive the room was for one night, I was very disappointed.< /text>

The front desk employee told me that the discounts I was entitled to could be honored because "the manager needs to approve and he's not here right now."  Seriously? Takes the manager to apply advertised discounts?  The she added "Plus we are fully booked and we don't give discounts." What?!  You actually are full and now that triggers a "no discount" policy?  What the heck? Plus....I just hate paying that much for a room just because it is SLO town and motels stick it to all the clients unlike anywhere else.  $178 for one night with no discounts in SLO.  Seriously?</Review>

Was put in a smoking room.  Was charged for five nights when we only stayed for two. Front office manager was rude on the phone when straightening out the proper nights to be charged for.  Water pressure for shower and sink is way too low and it seems there is a water softener in use, which makes you feel slimy when taking a shower.<//Text>

The room was very dirty. The parking lot was very dirty. We would have complained but we got there at midnight I was too tired to do anything. Air conditioner blew directly on the bed so he couldn't turn it on. Stayed at many other  Hotel 6, But the San Luis Obispo North hotel was the worst we've ever stayed at. We will not be staying there again</text>

<Time>1485112082320</Time><Rate>1< /Rate><Review>I stayed for 2 nights and my room was never cleaned or even visited by a housekeeper.
Upon arrival, I found a sticky surface on a shelf I was going to use to put my things. I called Housekeeping and they wiped it. The next morning I was out for most of the day. Came back a 7pm and saw that no one has been to clean my room. The bed was unmade, the trash was full, the dirty towels I left on the bathroom floor were still there......
I informed the front desk and received a fresh towel.....but I still think I did not received the promised services.
I had already paid for the room, I was tired and did not want to go anywhere else.....
Would like a refund.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

no shampoo/conditioner in room. asked front desk person where we could buy and they told me to go down the street to a gas station. No luck there and too early for anywhere else that may sell it to be open because we had to get our daughter to an early college orientation. Later we found some in the vending machine when I went to get water. No cool! Why did they not tell us we could get out of machine?!
Also stained bedcovers and broken ice machines. Hookers out front and angry guy outside door.< /Review>

<text>I found it disconcerting that there was no shampoo in the shower. I've stayed at other motels in your price range and they had a refrigerator, microwave and shampoo.  It seems that at the very least some shampoo to clean the hair.  Also no free WIFI.  Again, those other motels had it in the same price range.  I hate to get all lathered up about the shampoo and the other amenities, , but . I would have enjoyed my shower and my stay more in one of those others.  Also the room was a little dusty. (there was what looked like a hair ball in one place and there was a dead spider next to the wall behind the bed) And one of the shower tiles needed repair.</text><pics>None<//pics>< GmapID>

< Review>
You don't expect much at a Motel 6 and you don't get much.  In our case, the shower enclosure had many long strands of black hair on the walls and floor and a partially used bar of soap in the shower.  Evidently it had not been cleaned since the last guest.  There were no shampoo or conditioner amenities either.  I don't know if Motel 6 is "bring your own" or if this too was an oversight by the housekeeping staff.  While the room seemed to have been recently painted, it and the bedding had that dank odor of stale cigarettes and I couldn't wear my pajamas when I got home the next night because they smelled of that room.  Our neighbors were very noisy, talking loudly right outside our door until very late and all of them were smokers, smoking outside their rooms all around us.  I saw a used hypodermic needle in the parking lot while walking the dog in the morning. (Good news, they allow pets which is a huge plus and the primary reason we stayed there).

It's not the Ritz but it's among the cheapest options around.</Review>

The only thing I didn't like was the $200 Labor Day charge but all motels were pricey for the weekend   The normal rate is $69.00.  the motel was sold out but clean and very comfortable.</Review>

It seems like it would be standard to have a refrigerator and microwave in every room. We spent a lot of money to stay at your motel and had to keep buying ice to keep our drinks cold and weren't able to eat our leftovers because we had no microwave. Last time we stayed in one of your motels, I was able to use my AARP discount, which you've stopped, and signing up for My 6 on your website is useless. When we arrived, we decided to get a second room, but couldn't get a discount for being a member...the discount would have been very nice considering how much the room rates were hiked up for the holiday weekend.</text>

<Review>Assigned a room that was not ready. Had to ask for another. The Expedia price was not honored. I had to show the Expedia confirmation to the MANAGER. Was told the AARP discount was allowed but not subtracted from total bill. Billing questions remain till Visa confirms excess refund charges.<//Review>< Rating>

< review>
I reserved my room online ahead of time and onve i got there I was put in 3 different rooms, first room I got checked into the door was wide open when I got to my room, second room air conditioner didn't work and when I went to let the desk person know I was told there was no more downstairs rooms available unless I wanted to pay more so I had to carry my children in car seats upstairs. I was very unsatisfied with my stay and will not be back, I was inconvienced by the hotel and wasn't compensated in any way, only told I had to pay more if I wanted to stay downstairs.<//review>

Jeremy, at the front desk, was awesome. If my rating were based on Jeremy alone, it would be 10's all the way, but the cleaning staff didn't do a good job, my room was left dirty and there weren't enough towels. Also I paid for wi-fi and on the second day it didn't work.< /review>

The room had a some problems. 1) we found ants crawling up the bathroom door jamb at approx 9PM. We did not call front desk because we were ready for sleep and did not want to smell insecticide if that was the option. Cleaned as best we could and rubbed soap over the area to discourage ants. 2) electric outlet in bathroom did not work and one of the GFI red buttons was missing. Pushing the GFI did not help. 3) One of the bedspreads had an obvious stain.< /Text><pics>None< /pics><resp>None<//resp>< Gmap_id>

It was a hassle to try and get 2 rooms together but they did it, that was great! What ruined it for us was the cockroachs that ran up the wall on the wall the bed was on, right over our heads. Totally gross. I know these places are used for low life people but when in a bind for a place to stay for the night, it's cheap and ok, this time was not ok. I guess it could of been worst, it could of been bed bugs. The room was mostly clean to the naked eye, but bugs tell me different.<//Review>

<text>For starters, we got assigned to a room that somebody was already In.   Then we downgraded to a room with one bed instead of the two beds we reserved. No discount was offered.  The bathroom ceiling leaked right above where you stand to use the sink. We were on the first floor, so clearly something was wrong with the plumbing in the room above.  So no, it really didn't work out.< /text>< pictures>

<text>I booked my room. I even called ahead of time and talked to Adrian to let him know that I would be doing a late check-in after driving four hours to him after work. He assured me that it was fine, he'd note the account, and that because I'd paid already my room would be held for 24 hours no matter what.

When I arrived at 2 AM, the new clerk said he'd given my room away. He was unapologetic and when I told him about my conversation with Adrian, he simply shrugged and said that Adrian never called him so there was nothing he could do. He gave my room away. He didn't apologize at all because he didn't care.

He did have a different room I could use, but there was ONE BED. I needed two as there was more than one person with me. It was 2 AM and we were exhausted so we uncomfortably and awkwardly shared a bed.

In the morning when I awoke, the shower was ice cold for myself and my guest. There was no hot water at all at 8:30 AM.

It was an awful stay and awful experience and I was saddened by the lack of care, remorse, and lack of treatment.

Location otherwise seemed okay, though the parking was extremely limited and crowded. I had to park all the way in the back, in a dark corner. As a female, arriving at night, this was unnerving.

There was no provided shampoos other than one tiny (smaller than a pinky) sized soap.<//text>< Date>

Things were clean and adequate.  The only drawback was that they did not have the ability to process credit cards.  Luckily we had cash.  Not always true.</Text>

Not a fair price booking from Motel 6. Priceline gave my friend a better price for a room with refrigerator. We booked the rooms on the same day. I got the same size room for a much higher price and have no refrigerator.< /review>

<Text>Rooms adequate, not great. Thin walls thus noisy.  Strange neighbors! Swearing, beer drinking lying around windows open so you couldn't help but hear rude conversations.......and extremely expensive for a motel 6....$120 approx. Granted it was in SLO on a weekend, but it felt scuzzy and a ripoff.
Room itself was ok, I did not interact with staff.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

<Rating>4<//Rating><Text>Very clean and neat room. Everything I needed. Except for no free wifi and when I called the front desk to add wi-fi I was told I would have to go down to the office to pay for it which seemed very inconvenient. Luckily we spent most of the night away from the room so it wasn't needed but free wifi just seems like it should be standard. Other than that, great room, easy to find and plenty of vending machine selection which we did use after a night out in downtown SLO.<//Text><pics>None< /pics><resp>None< /resp><gmapID>0x80ecf0ce8f23c2cf:0x9829ede04ee2907d</gmapID></record>

<Text>Everything, besides the customer service was fine. The young caucasion (bigger) female at the front desk (forgot the name) was not helpful whatsoever, she disregarded the booking sites I was attempting to use for a better deal. She took forever to set up our room, after i finally agreed to not use my sites. She literally ignored me, even though I was clearly the one paying. It was disrespectful, and i was placed in such an akward situation! My boyfriend enjoyed being complimented and hit on though -_- apparantly thats what it takes to get good service here. I wasn't intending on writing this review, but since google keeps insisting on it, here i am! Management, please review your employees! Also, I never got a hairdryer, even though I kept calling for one. Overall it was a pleasant stay, buuuut half the toilet paper roll seemed used... lol not a big deal, but kind of gross to me. 😅<//Text><userid>101585435197863711708< /userid>< rate>

< review>
The location was great and right off the freway. The things I didnt like was the rooms were dirry, the shower curtain smelled like mildew, the towels were GROSS! The receptionist at the desk was intiminatiing with bright orange -red hair, a hoop ring in her nose with tattoos. I feel people who works at front desk should be presentable! I have for many years stayed in Motel 6 but this one was worst and for the price I paid was OVER PRICED(regardless of what other hotels are charging)!

I will NOT EVER stay at that LOCATION AGAIN!

Sincerely,
Disappointed customer< /review>

Rooms are a bit bare, but the front desk was willing to give free WiFi since Expedia's entry says they have free WiFi.< /review>

I show uo an hour after  check in and they tell me i will have to come back in at least an hour. Now im not happy because i drove four hours and wanted a shower and to change before i went to my event. So i come back ar 11pm and they tell me they gave my room away and computers are down and i have to pay cash only. Now im realy pissed. No manager anywhere just the poor maintenance guy they stuck up there and he did his best. They lost me as a customer<//Text>

<Pics>None< /Pics><review>The hotel was ok the first 2 nights, on my 3rd night my room was not cleaned at all. When I went to the front desk the guy up front was telling me there was nothing he can do, when I asked for a manager he said he was on vacation. The lobby was full of unhappy guests, the guy said he was going to call the police, no idea why as I never did anything. The police came and said the hotel guy wanted me gone, it was about 8 at night. Just absolutely ridiculous! Worst hotel ever! Still waiting for my refund for the last night I didnt stay there. Guy was a completely inappropriate and worst customer service ever!< /review>< Resp>

<Text>The only complaint I have recently concerns the 10% senior discount. Twice in the last month I have stayed at Motel 6 after booking on line and receiving a confirmation # with the discount. THEN, WHEN I CHECKED IN THERE WAS NO DISCOUNT UNTIL I PULLED UP A .pdf screen shot on my cell phone showing the correct price with the discount. THIS HAPPENED TWICE- SO IT SEEMS TO BE SOMETHING INTENTIONAL. THIS NEEDS TO BE CORRECTED.< /Text><UserId.>111253477469390338701</UserId.></record></dataset><record>

<review>This chain is priced $49.99 to $69.99 all up on down the I-5. Whoever owns this location jacks up the prices on the weekends and is not consistent in pricing. Just looking to make money on a budget chain. Do not stay at any hotel that ups the prices on weekends at one of these chains.<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

I asked at the desk when I checked out for a refund - at least a partial refund would have been fair. The woman I spoke with said she'd have the manager call me but I didn't hear from anyone.

I don't think the service I received was very professional.</Review>< pictures>

I stayed for 5 nights, despite requesting for housekeeping, my room was never cleaned, on the 4th night just the towels were recycled but trash wasn't taken and vacuumed/mopped or whatever totally disappointed, there was no fridge, m'wave when asked why front office staff said it was because of the promotional deal, question is why wasn't it mentioned at the time of reservation?< /Text>

Well for starters when you pull into this location you have about 3 or 4 beat up cars with crackheads sitting in the parking lot asking for money or smokes from you while you try and go to the front desk. In the rooms itself, the AC unit is all broken and up in pieces, and when the fan is one it just blows dust and dirt for about an hour straight. Table in the room is wobbly as can be since not a single leg is even and all have different wear patterns on the rubber bases. Go to the bathroom and I had white towels with black stains on them all over, then go to grab a towel from the towel rack and the rack comes apart on me. Then we move over to the toilet and the only have a half used roll of toilet paper in the whole room. Went to the bathroom once and barely had enough to wipe my nose after. Then all night one of the crackheads was walking around looking in the bed of my truck talking to herself, then would go back to her car and scream while driving around. Don't go hear, pay the money to get a place that has a lobby and locked corridors so you don't get the same disturbances. But for what I paid in the price of the hotel room, feel like this place is an absolute waste and a rip off.<//Text>

<review>The floor in the bathroom was filthy. Had blood and hair and dirt. Looked like it hadn’t been cleaned in a very long time. The room smelled musty. For the price I paid to stay at a Motel 6, which was $150  I would expect it to be clean.</review>< user>

<Rating>3</Rating><Review>water was dripping from the light in the shower in room 111 and I did report that to the front desk, when I used my reservation I had for the third day the office attendant charged me more than my printed reservation I had  and when I asked him why he was charging me more than I was quoted he said Motel6 must have raised the prices. I did not challenge  the attendant on his answer but did ask him to cancel the reservation for the third day because I was paying cash and didn't want my card charged by mistake and he said he would but I found out the next day he didn't cancel it and I was charged twice for the same room.<//Review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

<Review>This is the first time that I have stayed in a Motel 6 in some time. I was distressed to find that neither shampoo, conditioner, or even wash cloths were provided.

And the price was not that much lower than a Marriott.

I will not be staying in Motel 6's again unless there are no other options.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>{'time': 1497029024972, 'text': "Dear Tom, Thank you for taking the time to share your review.

<Review>I checked in, went to the room and immediately went back to the front desk to ask for a refund.  The room smelt like cigarettes and urine, and there was hair in the bathroom sink and shower. I  thought I could tough it out since it was only for the night, until I pulled back the bedding and saw hair on the sheets. Thats when I knew there was NO WAY I could stay there.< /Review><pics>None</pics><Response>None<//Response>< gmapID>

The hotel is clean but very basic.  There was a charge for wifi and you could only connect one device to it.</Review>

<Review>My room was dirty and looked like it wasn't properly cleaned. My lenings looked old and not property taken care of or maintained. We also had uninspected run in with a rat in our room.

The room was clean. The AC worked but not well. I did slam my knee into it while sleeping because the bed is right up against it. Also the towels were so thin and small. However, it's what I expected.</text>

<Text>I made a reservation for 2 beds, checked in late and was only given one bed which was horribly broken down.  The front desk clerk treated me like I was dirt off the freeway.  The shower was dirty with hair and grime, sheets were dirty as well.  We are regular Motel 6 customers and I will never stay at this location again.<//Text>< Date>

Bed linen of very poor quality (rough) blood stain on the mattress, which gave the feeling of dirty.

(Translated by Google) To follow the hotel's environmental policy, I asked that towels and sheets NOT be changed in the 3 days I spent at the hotel, but they were changed. I think the front desk staff did not pass my request to the housekeeper. The reception staff must be well trained to pass the requests to the housekeepers and to comply with their important environmental conservation policy.
Thank you

(Original)
Para seguir la política de medio ambiente del hotel pedí que NO me cambiaran las toallas y sábanas en los 3 días que pasé en el hotel, pero SI las cambiaron. Creo el personal de recepción no pasó mi solicitud a la recamarera. El personal de recepción debe estar bien entrenado para pasar las solicitudes a las recamareras y que se cumpla con su importante política de conservación del medio ambiente.

<text>(Translated by Google) It's a good motel, perfect for sleeping if you need an intermediate location on the California coast. The beds are comfortable and it is very tidy. It has free parking, pool and Wifi. The only bad thing is that there is nothing nearby to eat, and if you arrive very late at night you must drive at least 15 minutes to get to the nearest In n Out (burger restaurant).

Es un buen motel, perfecto para dormir si necesitas un lugar intermedio en la costa de California. La camas son comodas y es muy ordenado. Tiene parqueadero gratuito, piscina y Wifi. Lo unico malo es que no hay nada cerca para comer, y si llegas muy tarde en la noche debes manejar al menos 15 minutos para llegar al In n Out (restaurante de hamburguesas) mas cercano.< /text>< date>

The rest very impersonal. Regular situation, area far from services.

(Translated by Google) Typical Motel 6 standard room. Relatively clean, full size beds, they only give soap. No shampoo, hairdryer, fridge, microwave or free WiFi. Compensates with a low price. It is to be appreciated that they have a 24 hour reception and they checked us in past 12 o'clock at night with no problems.

(Original)
Típica habitación de Motel 6 estándar. Relativamente limpia, camas tamaño full, solo dan jabón. No champú, secador, nevera, microondas o WiFi gratis. Compensa con un precio bajo. Es de apreciar que tienen una recepción 24 horas y nos hicieron el check in pasadas las 12 de la noche sin problemas.<//review>

<review>(Translated by Google) The motel was very neat and painted, it looks like it was recently maintained but we asked for a non-smoking room and it smelled like cigarettes, it had no fridge, no microwave oven, no hairdryer like everyone else
Moldy bathroom seals
The truth is to pay 200 dollars for that I did not like it.

(Original)
El motel muy cuidado y pintado, se ve que le dieron mantenimiento hace poco pero pedimos habitación para no fumadores y olía a puro cigarrillo, no tenía nevera ni horno microondas, ni secador de pelo como todos
