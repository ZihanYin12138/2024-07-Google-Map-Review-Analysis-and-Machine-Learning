After reading some of the other reviews, it seems to be a common problem. Not all the products are priced. There is no screen to see your itemized charges when checking out. My mom and I spent over $250 together, only to have to ask what the prices were on most of the things we bought. When I asked for my total the cashier said I could take a pic with my phone, huh? They really can just charge whatever. This just seems shady and it doesn't build trust with your customers. I would recommend going somewhere with more transparent prices and a more professional check -out process. I won't be back.</Text>

<Review>The service was great anf the staff was very kind and helpful, and for that they get a 5 star rating. However, I bought a wig which has to be assembled. Staff gave me no instuctions on how to assemble the thing. I was told to look on YouTube for tutorials. It took me forever to find the style of wig which they sold me. I finally found it only to find out that I needed to buy a mannequin head as well. I also was sold the wrong adhesive and when I applied it to the mannequin head pro tutorial, the adhesive Staind the wig Parts where the stitching is read or some color thereof and totally ruined it. So now I'm going to call them and see if they will take it back or just trade it in for a wig because I had to buy the adhesive had to buy the mannequin head and some stitching gear 2 put it together, which I was not told about. Had I known this I would not have bought this thing but would rather have bought a wig because it ended up costing me more to buy accessories put it together with no experience. So in that they get a one-star for lack of knowledge. I'm going to call them right now and see if they'll return it and I have lost the receipt so we have yet to see I will post the pictures if all does not go right. Peace shalom and all that good stuff. Your friend the rabbi. Stay tuned.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None</Response><gmapID>0x80c290db172e9a31:0x5add4d6ca4a86990< /gmapID></record>

First time here and super disappointed. The staff is not friendly at all. The girls will over price you... a lot of items are not prise. And if you ask for help they look at you up and down. Lazy girls that don't want to work.  The manager gives the girls the ok to charge what they want. So it all depends on weather they like you. Worst business ever.< /Review>

This beauty supply is OVER PRICED! The environment is unfriendly and their reward program is useless. Also for some very odd reason they don’t allow you to take pictures of the product to send to your hairstylist. I’ve never ever been told that this was not permissible in any other beauty supply I’ve been to. I frequently send pictures of the products i buy to my hairstylist so that I don’t mistakenly buy the wrong thing. This extremely important seeing as though trying to return an item they  treat you like a common criminal not to mention they do not itemize the products on your receipt! And this is coming from someone who never return items. I only return or exchange if i can find absolutely no use for them. It’s an utter and completed waste of time. I will not return. I’d much rather spend my money at the countless other beauty supplies throughout LA! Don’t go here!<//Text>

<Text>NOT HAPPY AT ALL!

I shop at this location for 2 reasons...the fact that I live in walking distance and the great service I get from the young girls working part-time

But let me tell you, the Middle Ages cashier/manager of Asian decent is extremely rude with a attitude! Someone please coach her on customer service!

My last purchase there was a $500 hand tied human hair girl wig that lasted 1 WEEK! After 1 WASH IT WAS TRASH

Wow is one. Only thing is the attitude of the cashier when asked about prices. A lot of products had no visible pricing.  When people Ask about the cost of something it does not mean they are Cheap. That is a smart shopper price comparing. Some things there you do better ordering Amazon. But they have everything and shopping physically is satisfying.< /review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

They have a wide range of wigs. If your a wig lover like me check this place out. I do however think they are way overpriced unless they have a sale going on.  You can find any wig they sell here online for half the price. I wouldn't suggest buying from here only for the fact that you can save money ordering online, this store is good for trying them on first before buying online. They charge $1 for a wig cap so you can try on 5 wigs at one time.</Text>

The merchant told me if I was on drugs , since I was having a hard time choosing the exact hair color . Obviously no one will like wearing something that’s not similar as your hair color .
Her name was Karen I believe , but she had black long hair .
I then purchased some extensions (not knowing about the refund policy because the merchant didn’t explain to me at the time of the purchase , so I left the purchase there with her and she said if I don’t walk away with the purchase she was gonna call security .
But I still did not take the purchase , it was a really bad experience for me .</review>

Customer service is extremely lacking they act as if you don't exist or they follow you around the store as if you're going to steal everything in it! Make sure you know exactly what to buy ahead of time and purchase exactly what you need because they know NOTHING about the products they sell and returning an item is impossible. Surprised they still get business with such poor customer service and the Korean lady with the short dark hair is the worse! Please stay home and hire people who actually care about the service they provide to paying customers who contribute to your livelihood. I will say the Reseda and Vanowen location has friendlier staff, better service and more pleasant atmosphere all around AVOID THIS LOCATION if possible or try Fox Beauty in Pacoima.<//text>

I shop at this supply store very frequently . I easily spend 50 to 60 bucks every time i go. My nieces and mil all shop here as well. BUT TODAY I GO IN AND BUY A 30$ SHAMPOO AND CONDITIONER THINKING IT WAS A SHAMPOO COLOR CORRECTOR . I REALIZE MY MISTAKE AND GO BACK IN MAYBE 3 HR LATER WITH UNOPENED BOX AND RECIEPT. THE VERY RUDE LADY WOULD NOT LET ME EXCHANGE FOR THE CORRECT SHAMPOOING SET I NEEDED. needless to say, she lost a few customers today.<//text>

Wow! Wigs’a massive inventory includes more than wigs and extensions.The store sells make-up, hair and skincare , jewelry and  more!
While I appreciated the selection,  customer service was non -existent (puzzling  ).
Special note: for  those hard -pressed to find   ethnic products in the valley, Wow seems to cater to all ethnicities, especially Black women. Huge surprise,  if you’re in the valley! I will definitely go back - next time, with a friend!< /Review>

BUYER NEWARE!!!!I came in to there atore and tried to buy hair oil that was priced and fully stocked for $4.99. The lady scanned it and said $11.99. I showed them where their employee stocked it wrong,and that by law they have to sell it to me for that price. The lady with dark hair yelled and was rude. I told her that she is illegal and that im giving a review. I would give less than a star but the system won't let me< /review>

<Review>VERY RACIST LOCATION!!! One of the fat young clerks actually followed me around the store! Really!? My damn car was literally parked in front of the store! If I was a thief, WHICH I AM NOT, a "quick getaway" was not possible anyhow! I even told her to knock it off, which she eventually did. Fat sloth! Stop courting dollars from people of color, all the while being ignorant and disrespectful! THIS LOCATION IS 100% LOSER LAND! For a pleasant, dignified shopping experience, I recommend the Reseda store on Vanowen street. This store is racist and employs fat baboons with third grade educations, whose pea brains have no idea what the hell customer service is! ZERO STARS! AVOID! AVOID! AVOID!< /Review>< Response>

I have been a member since 2017 but first time at this location and I’m very unsatisfied. It’s March 28 around 8:45 pm ( for the management) and the employee yelled at me “ aye you put your mask on”. I think my mask wasn’t covering my nose for a second. I mean if he were to ask me nicely that would be much better. Then he threatened me that he would have me leave . Unbelievable.</text>

I really like this place! Other then the really mean cleaning lady at night! I’m not one to call someone out, but she is really mean. I get you got to clean the bathroom. I also got to pee and change into my workout gear.  After 12 is a no go for the lockers</review>

It is small but I like it much better than other large 24 hours. If u come on certain times it will be free all around. The environment is good. No show off, no thugs, no judgments. The people coming over there are mostly the residents of that area.<//text>

< Review>
I joined the club to use the Pilates classes. However, after joining I was told that that classes are only online. There is not in person Pilates classes. I only use the GYM on the first day that I joined. I asked for a refund, and, they refused to pay me back. They should have explained their classes system clearly. I have found their advertisement system misleading.</Review>

After reading reviews I was very skeptical about visiting... This place is better than I expected. If you consider the age, it's super clean, equipment is decent, not crowded at all for a sunny Saturday afternoon. Came in at 12:30, and all machines had multiple vacancies.  I think some spin bikes would be awesome, but obviously not necessary. I'll definitely be coming back.</Text>

As everyone said the staff is great.. it's only a few mins from my home that's the main reason I go.. the club is way too small. and Fri-Sun are the only great workouts I can get due to less equipment than people.  I get a great price so that and the great staff keep me coming. . Otherwise, the gym is the worst one I've ever been a member of but I'm happy to have it nearby.<//text>

For the most part the gym serves it purpose. Though the place could use some up grades but convinced the experience could be so much better. Staff is real chilled and that makes a difference. Peace King & Queen< /review>

<Review>Welp i really love this location because it is right around the corner of my house.

PARKING

I have to admit this is one of the worst parking lot. There are too much retail shops nearby and parking isn't just enough. I have tried finding parking for over 15 mins before, they are always jam busy packed in this parking lot. I dislike this! There are additional parking behind the building and yes there are usually one or 2 slots open. i would recommend you just jog or run or walk or bike if you live nearby. Otherwise be prepare to stress over parking

INTERIOR

Inside is alway busy. I think the slowest time is usually is the mid afternoon like one ish to 3 ish. Also inside is crowded with lots of machines in the cardio and weight room as well. Also sometimes really warm and smell of sweat is what you can smell.

MACHINES

They did have old cardio machines but lately they did some upgrade and got some new machines so this boosts the place for a additional star. They are usually wet and dirty after someones workout who don't wipe after themselves like todays treadmill i got on. I usually try not to touch the machines and if i do i will go wash hands asap.

WEIGHT ROOM

They are a bit more organized for the weights re racking. Sometimes it could be messy and in the wrong category while people mis re rack them. The weight room is small and i feel like everyone is looking at each other lol.

STAFFS

The employees here are usually friendly and helpful. They are nice and always greet you when you walk in or walk out. They help change channels or help you operate a machine if help is needed.

VIBE

The vibe in here i feel like its chill place. Also feel like i workout with lots of elder people since this gym is more elder people attend during day time. Sometimes i feel like the elders are way more healthy and in shape for me by always going and seeing them go at it lol. i feel like everyone who goes here are to workout and stay healthy and are friendly.

LOCKERS

The lockers are old and usually you will need to bring your own lock to lock your stuff. Also they have an open shower room with no privacy. The stalls are usually wet and humid from the steam from the shower rooms.

SAUANA AND STEAM ROOM AND JACUZZI

Love the steam room, i feel like i demo everything from my body after a good steam after my workout. It also relaxes all my muscles and aches and pains from the body. Also feels like i did a deep cleanse on my face like a facial dextox. It is wet inside and adding your sweat can make you drench when you walk out.

The sauna is a dry version of a steam room. This one is more popular than the steam room, because no one wants to be drenched wet and go into the car or back into the gym. Also i feel like this helps you dry off from the steam room. also love how you go in dry and come out with real sweat dripping from your face.

TO SUM IT UP

I love the location which is in a nice area. I also love how it is close to my home. Love how My goal of coming here to get a good quality workout and be done with my workout asap and get out of there. Also love how there is a starbucks like 2 min walk and get a ice cold drink after. Thanks for reading and have a good workout and day lol.</Review><Resp>None</Resp>< name>

< Review>
The Good: Most of staff are very nice / helpful -- Pocket facility is the closest 24-Hour gym to my house

The Bad: Old facility - ofter stifling (staff have to prop doors open) - bad odor - old equipment - a great number of exercise machines (e.g. elipticals, treadmils) are repeatedly broken and out of service for extended times - small and mostly overcrowded - unclean - people sneeze, cough, spit, sweat and bleed on mchines and only rarely do they even wipe the machines down when done - staff use to go through just about hourly wiping down and sanitizing machines, but haven't done that in several years now

Bottom Line: This 24-Hour facility has slid onto the bottom tier - I (and a large number of other current members) are looking forward to checking out the new California Family Fitnes Center (A Sacramento owned and operated company since 1991) opening in the Pocket area soon

NOTE: Be very leery of the 5-star rating someone gave to this facility 3 years ago -- it just doesn't jive with reality< /Review>

I live only 5  minutes away but I refuse to workout at this location.  The environment and size of the gym is very disappointing.  The locker rooms, spa and pool are very old.  24hr has been saying they will upgrade this location but I've been hearing that for 3 years.< /text>

<Review>This is my home gym. It is small, and they haven't done much to it for years. Parking can be a problem at peak hours. But it's close to home and it gets the job done.</Review><UserId.>104153724584272463037</UserId.>< Pics>

<review>A friends recommend and it for sure didn't disappoint. Best Chinese food I have had in the TO area...now i don't need to drive all the way to LA for yang chow!!! The food was delicious! I got 4 dishes for my family of 5, the portions were huge, and still have leftovers . I got crispy shrimp( 10/10, best thing ever!! a must try), Ho Fun Beef noodles( 10/10, i didn't see it on menu but saw pictures from other people so i took a change...and it didn't disappoint. They are similar to glass noodles but wider/ thicker) spicy honey chicken( 7/10, A sweeter orange chicken) and dry chili chicken( 9/10, kinda like popcorn chicken with a dry rub)
Can't wait to go back!!<//review>< resp>

Sesame Inn is a small, local Chinese restaurant located in the hills of Newbury Park off Wendy Drive. The food is authentic and delicious with dishes such as the savory Hot & Sour Soup and the tangy sweet Szechuan Chicken. I haven't been here in awhile but I recently visited during the shutdown, and the takeout food is just as good as ever. Thank you Sesame Inn for the delicious meal!<//text>

My favorite restaurant in town for sure! We'd had a hard time finding good Chinese food after moving to the area, and I may or may not have teared up a little at first bite. Everything I've had here is good, and the staff are so sweet. I can't recommend Sesame Inn enough.</text>

<rating>5</rating><text>Nice neighborhood Chinese place that does a lot of business. Food has almost always been good.
The previous owners and staff really ran a good shop and the owner would be waking around checking to make sure that all was good. The new team is still learning but they need to make it more personable.<//text>< pics>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Text>I have fallen in love with glass noodles here. They serve it with pork belly and other sprouts and I can guarantee you that it's awesome.
I have also had Fish with Wine sauce  and it's good too. It's one of the rare authentic Chinese places I would say.
There is dearth of seats on weekends as it is a small place so early reservation would be wise.
Staff is very kind and cooperative.< /Text>< Pictures>

Been coming here for years.   Very good food and nice staff and good service.  Only negative is that there are so few places to sit and dine in comfortably.  I also have gone to Mandarin Inn where food is not as good but much nicer dining area.  I would say Sesame is best for take out.<//Review>

<text>Came here with my family and ordered the orange chicken, cashew chicken, and the vegetable lo mein to share. They were all generous in portion and tasted wonderful. Their prices are super reasonable. Will definitely be back here. The only thing you may have to watch out for is that the dinner area is small so there are not very many tables.<//text>< rating>

Best Chinese food in Newbury Park. Staff is very friendly. I go so often they know my order already. That's great service! Try the House Crispy Chicken, it's delicious. Great portion sizes for the price, I always have left overs. The food comes out fast, both for dine in and take out. It's a small restaurant, so it usually gets packed during peak hours, which is a testament to their popularity. Try it, you'll be glad :)<//text>

<Text>A solid 5/5!! This is probably the most authentic restaurant around the Thousand Oaks area!! The boss is very very friendly, I always see her with regular customers and always sparking a conversation with them. Being Chinese myself I believe that is the most authentic Chinese cuisine in the area. I would recommend this place to anyone.</Text><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

<text>We've  loved this place for 19 years since Jennifer and her husband owned it. We order mostly take outa at least once if not twice per month.  The quality of the food seems to be the same: excellent.

Probably the best Chinese I've had outside of Chinatown. Dry Chili Chicken is amazing along with their spicy green beans. Small dining room, so be prepared to wait or just take it to go.</review>

I haven't found any other Chinese restaurant in the Ventura County area that can come close to this place as far as quality of food and service goes.  Definitely on par with some of the places I've eaten in the Bay Area.  Nothing we've ordered was ever disappointed us.  Braised Green Beans, Dry Spicy Chicken (other menu), and Vegetable Egg Foo Young are my favorites.  If you like Orange Chicken, it is one of the best - crispy, tangy, and sweet!  Portions are huge and prices are very reasonable.  We always order way more than we can eat in one sitting, so we have lots of leftovers.<//review>< user_name>

You walk in and you are immediately greeted as if you're old, dear friends come to visit.  The staff is very warm, friendly and charming.  The seating is limited but stay, the food is the freshest I've had in decades and so full of flavor, it's just a sublime delight!  The serving portions will always leave you taking food home!  Seriously, this is the best chinese I've had in ages!</text>

Love the food! The people! The owner!
Only downside? The location is super small. Plan ahead for long waits and cramp spaces. Other than that; it's absolutely perfect!</Text>

Food is okay but employees on the phone don’t get the order right. This has been a consistent problem here and makes them appear rude. Wish there was another option in the area.</Review>

Menu on Google is not complete. It is missing quite a few items offered.

Adventurous diners and those that like highly spiced dishes should ask for the 2nd menu of new dishes.<//review>

Called for a delivery, but was told I'm to far?

I live off the Camarillo Springs exit, they are off Wendy Dr. According to Google Maps my location is 4.6 miles away, 9 minutes. They won't deliver to the very next exit?? Unacceptable. If you advertise delivery within a 5 mile radius you should uphold that commitment to potential customers regardless of which direction your driver has to go.</text>

<review>The best Chinese food around. Love the wonton soup and potstickers. The Kung pao chicken is awesome. We go here A LOT!!! It's a small place restaurant and it gets very busy on the weekends but because of the kids we eat around 5:30 so we have no problem getting a table. If all else fails you can call and get it delivered< /review>< rate>

Me and my wife visited California in the spring of 2008. We were at L.A. during the Easter weekend. My wife is a 7th day Adventist. We decided to attend the Sabbath school and the worship the Saturday just before Easter Sunday at the iconic Hollywood Seven Day Adventist Church.
We arrived really early because of our 8hour jet lag. I remember the deep blue sky and the tall imperial palm trees on the street nearby. The church was not very crowded but we got a warm welcome.
I was impressed with the type of discussions the members had at the Sabbath School.
But what I really liked was the warm and cosy worship, the informality of the pastor and the impressive band (with guitar, bass, drums and keyboards). It was a very unconventional ceremony for our experiences but I still remember it as a memorable one.
Next time we visit LA I will try to go there again.
Cheers<//Text>

<Text>For your church family in Hollywood, hoping that your church with the community of Hollywood need to get involved with Spectrum Cable, AT&T U-Verse, DISH Network, DIRECTV, AT&T TV, etc. to write or call them and to request 3ABN and Hope Channel networks to be added to their services.  Please pray for this endeavor to reach out and win souls for Jesus?  These and other SDA channels are also available on Roku, Amazon Fire TV, MySDATV, and Interless Box by MySDATV too.  Thank you and God Bless you.<//Text>< Pictures>

⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ 1/2

Overall: This is one the more progressive Adventist churches I've attended. The church gives a breath of fresh air to those looking for a Christianity that addresses issues that many churches do not, yet does so in a welcoming, supportive, and positive way. If you're looking for great contemporary worship music, this is definitely a place to check out!  Hollywood has a great community with church members that welcome everyone, despite their background!

Welcomeness: When I entered the church, I was kindly greeted by someone with a smile and given a bulletin. The congregation was also warm and welcoming!

Environment (what it looked like)
The sanctuary was set up like an open auditorium with cushioned pews. It was well lit with natural lighting. There were many screens for lyrics and announcements which made it great to view from all seating angles.  The church's audio and visual system provided great sound and helpful slides which were projected to help the congregation follow along with the songs and the message. The lobby had a cafe feel with tables and chairs.

Atmosphere in church (the shared feelings from the building)
The church gives a meditative and comfortable atmosphere. The church was 30% filled which made you feel like you had a good deal of space to yourself.

Worship Music
The worship music, consisting of a full band with guitar, bass, keyboard, drums, and a few vocalists were great! Musicians were well polished and the vocalists sounded great together. There were four contemporary songs in the set that the congregation was very familiar with and participated at a high level.
- category: contemporary
- instrumentation type: guitar, bass, keyboard, drums, 3 vox
- quality:  great
- crowd engagement: high
- duration: 4 songs

Sermon
The head pastor preached a message that connected with the audience. His message was very contemporary, drawing metaphors and connections from today's events and culture. He had a story-telling delivery drawing stories from his life.  Rather than exclusive, his message was welcoming and inclusive to all people, all denominations, and all faiths. The sermon was reflective and thought provoking.
- Duration: 11:40-12:05

Service (Order of service)
- Opening song
- Worship & praise music
- Welcome & Greet
- Offering / song

Demographics
- ages: young adult - young professionals - adult
- family oriented: few families
- attendance: 60-70
- single ethnicity / multiple: plethora of various nationalities including Caucasian, African-American, Pacific Island / Asian, etc
- dress / attire: casual - business casual

I celebrated my graduation last night in this great restaurant. I am glad to say that we passed a terrific evening and the venue was absolutely the reason for that happy gathering. The team  participated in a graceful way, the meals were tasty and my guests were very  glad. We shall absolutely come back again for more joyful events. Thank you very much.</review>

<review>We were looking for a no-chain coffee shop for breakfast. We found Dos Hermanos. It exceeded our expectations. My breakfast burrito was eggxcelent and they were accommodating to my daughter's vegan diet. She ordered the burrito in a bowl. Our order took about 20 minutes but everything was fresh and yummy. The wait was totally worth it. Also, there's a sign telling you about the wait which I think is really useful. The person at the register was helpful and cordial.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

GREAT FOOD!! My favorite thing from their menu is the hard shell tacos with avocado but my family always ends up buying 20 or more of the little soft tacos. Friendly service and not a bad wait time for your food!</text>

Very well kept and accessible spot. They serve big portions and for inexpensive rates. We loved the meals a lot and the waiters were super affable and chatty. Recommended.<//Text>

Stopped by for a burrito To-Go on our way to LA from SF. The steak burrito was fantastic, very well seasoned meat with yummy rice and beans. Shared with my husband and feel full with just half of a large burrito. Good place to stop for lunch during road trip.<//text>

I love their friendly staff and all their food tastes fresh.  I'm a regular here, because of that. When I place my order over the phone they don't even ask for my name anymore, because they recognize whos ordering, but it's like that for others as well.  They make you feel at home. You have got to love a place like that. 💖 I see a lot of regulars there, i'm not the only one.< /review>

We were traveling and our two year old daughter needed to use the restroom. We asked politely, were denied, purchased a bean burrito so our daughter could use the restroom, and left. Bathroom was DISGUSTING. Burrito was cold, and beans dried out and stale with no cheese. Do not stop here, just move right on through.<//Text>

<review>In the continuing effort to locate, taste and report on the breakfast burritos of the county, I bring Dos Hermanos Breakfast burritos. What fun, A nice drive to San Miguel to test another burrito. The place is busy, I mean busy, 20 minutes for a burrito. There are locals, to go orders, soldiers from Camp Roberts, and us! Popular, or the best place in town.. Well that is for each individual to decide. I had the chili verde breakfast burrito and my son had the bacon burrito. We were both very pleased with the content, size, preparation and flavors. I will be returning and bringing friends, relatives and others to this place to test the menu further. The staff are working their tails off as they serve both the in house and to go orders and are oh so polite and pleasant as they work. I will be back. Thank you Dos Hermanos! And I love the murals and the colorful decor, both inside and out! If you are on the freeway, pull off and enjoy a burrito, or call in an order and enjoy it in the park just up the street, either way it is a good stop.< /review>< Time>

We first discovered this restaurant while driving down to SoCal on our way to Arizona, a couple of years ago (our home is in the East Bay Area near SF). Wanting just a snack, I chose a couple of chili verde tacos. MMMMMM; my mouth came alive with the wonderful flavor! From that trip onward, we make sure to stop whenever possible (almost any trip down or back up the 101), to get our chili verde fix. The combo plate is especially satisfying, which includes high quality refried beans and Mexican rice, along with tortillas. I'm honestly not sure I've ever had better chili verde, which is one of my go-to Mexican favorites. I hear people talk about the tamales and burritos, too, which I'm sure I'll try at some point.< /Text>

First  time here and first Mexican restaurant that doesn't offers chips and salsa.. we wait for our food half an hour,  and they mess up with our order so my mother in law,  had to wait even longer, by the time we go our order we did not had any drinks, and i was almost done with my food..  "it take them half an hours to serve our food and there was not one else here..."</Text>

I've been going here for over 10 years. It's a great place for homemade food served with a smile. I recommend the machaca breakfast burrito.</Review>

Food wasn't bad, if you have 20 minutes to waste waiting for a taco. There was no line but it still took a ridiculous amount of time.</text>

<text>Good burritos,  disappointed,  I tried calling to place a order as soon as they open for a burrito, and they never answer the phone, I went there and ask the girl there if they dont like answering the phone, she stated to me , they dont answe until later. Why have a phone if you dont answer.  It makes it easier for people that go to work to order ahead of time.<//text><rating>2<//rating><resp>None</resp>< Time>

All I can say is WOW!! I love chili verde, have tried it all over Monterey and San Luis Obispo Counties and this restaurant has the best! Everything we ordered was great! They are very friendly and aim to please! I am so impressed I ordered chili verde to serve at my family's reunion! Can't wait for that!<//Review>

DO NOT go there to pick something up without calling in your order first.  You will sit there for 30-45 min while they make all the pick up orders while you sit there waiting.<//review>

Enjoyed the chicken and beef tacos, but was disappointed with the red and green salsas.  Wasn't terrible,  but nothing special.</text>

(Translated by Google) In the scorching heat we arrived here and ate very well. Very friendly staff - and everything is fresh, so no fast food in the strict sense. WC is also available and provided with a combination lock, the combination of which is experienced by the staff. We would return here.

In glühender Hitze sind wir hier eingekehrt und haben sehr gut gegessen. Sehr freundliche Mitarbeiter - und alles wird frisch zubereitet, also kein Fastfood im engeren Sinne.

<review>From the moment  you arrive in that place  they give you a nice feeling. Very courteous hosts, it is a kind place to go out with buddies or with your date. Great  cuisine, creative  chef de cuisine, reasonable  cost and attentive  service. Highly recommended.</review><rate>5<//rate>< user>

< Review>
When I ordered, I read it to the guy and repeated it to make sure he heard it right. Well got it home and I specifically said no beans... There was beans, also said no rice in the Amigo Burrito, there was rice. The food was not hot and the chips we're stale. The Albondigus soup was blane. Don't know what's happened there. But really dissatisfied.</Review>

I love this place. The food is fresh and healthy. The street tacos are tasty, and their meatball soup makes a great lunch for work the next day. The people are friendly and helpful, something I really appreciate because I have food allergies.</review>

<Text>My wife and I travel for work. We have been enjoying Taco Tuesday ‘s for awhile now. If you’re traveling anywhere close to the high desert then take a short trip along old Route 66. Stop in Helendale for the best carnitas tacos that I have ever had. Everything we have ordered for the 4 short months was exceptional. The service was awesome. I will miss this place the most when we leave this area for our next assignment.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None</Response><gmap_id>0x80c3829faaf7a15d:0x832c132abc530d5</gmap_id></record>

Second time eating there and the food was improperly prepared again but with the added bonus of poor flavor and severe sickness after eating. I should have listened to the locals and stayed away.</text>

<Name>Brandon Evan<//Name><date>1496023003873</date><Rating>2</Rating><review>I have been eating here since Los Amigos opened. The quality has steadily slipped over the last few months. We've provided feedback to the staff and no one seems genuine about what we have to say. Today was the last and final time we will ever eat at Los Amigos. Every single item ordered did not match the ingredients listed on the menu. I asked for extra sides of sour cream and green sauce, was charged for them, and then never received them. The "burritos" were nothing more than canned re fried beans drowning in sauce with a tortilla somewhere in the mix. Unappetizing to look at and even worse to try to eat. When I called to politely inquire about the missing sides and awful burritos, I was argumentatively told that they were "busy" and were unable to do anything about the inedible food. Roughly $40 dollars, zero customer service, and general apathy towards legitimate concerns means I can not recommend Los Amigos nor will I eat there ever again. I will also not patron the owner's other restaurants and establishments in the community including Fratelli's Pizzeria due to the shameful lack of customer service. I wish this was the one and only time experiencing this that prompted me to post this review, however, this was the final straw. Two stars only because your food and customer service used to be something my family and I looked forward to.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

I love this place and I eat there at least twice a week. The staff is always friendly and provide great service. The fried ice cream is to die for along with the carnitas quesadilla, carnitas crunchy tacos and the cheese enchiladas! Oh and don't forget the beans!! ❤️❤️< /text>

<Text>Excellent across the board, from kind and attentive customer support, immaculate facilities where there was literally no odor, no mess, and units were maintained in immaculate condition. Most importantly, very transparent pricing. They may not be the cheapest, but you get more for what you pay. Peace of mind in a trusted and will maintained storage facility.<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

< review>
Exceptionally clean, with an exceptional staff who is willing to do whatever it takes to resolve an issue. The manager I worked with was very professional and provided exceptional customer service. He made it a point to go over the paperwork and show how to access the storage unit with the security pad and helped navigate the labyrinth of hallways and units. I highly recommend Security Public Storage in San Ramon, CA. The area is secure, climate controlled, and staff and management are excellent. This storage facility is bar none the best storage facility I have dealt with and highly recommend Security Public Storage in San Ramon, CA.</review>

Wanda worked with me on finding the best unit size for my needs and then worked with me on pricing as well.  She is always available for questions and handles everything with a smile and awesome upbeat attitude.  Access to my storage is amazing and easy, carts for assisting with heavy items are readily available, and the units are temperature controlled and clean.  You won't find a better storage experience in the area. I recommend this facility to whoever is reading this as well as all my friends.< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

I have rented at other storage companies in the past and have experienced  less than 5 Star service. Wanda is always ready to answer any concerns and give me the take-away that my continued business is of foremost importance. Having the units in air conditioned comfort is a major plus!</text>

Your stuff will be happy here! Yes, Security Public Storage in San Ramon is clean, climate controlled, and secure. Wanda and Shelby are super friendly, always greet you with a smile, and are dedicated to continually improving this facility. We have been SPS customers for only two years and wish we had moved here sooner. Excellent service, comfortable storage, safe building.<//Review>

The facility is VERY clean and well-kept. Security appears to be very solid (police-response alarms for each unit - nice) and the units themselves are built well. The climate control keeps things very cool inside which is a big plus. Pricing was good, and Wanda was very helpful!<//review>

So happy to have found Security Pubic Storage to store my belongings on a temporary basis, of which parting with my belongings was very difficult to do, due to unfortunate circumstances. Wanda, the new manager at the San Ramon location has been so wonderful to work with. She is very pleasant and down-to-earth bringing comfort to this difficult transition period. With the set-up of the storage facility, along with the facility and the air in the facility being very clean, etc., I feel very secure in having chosen, I believe, the best all around storage facility...Security Public Storage...and their promos offered are not to be passed up.

Thanks again Wanda for your help.

It was only a few minutes after arriving at SPS and meeting Wanda, the facility manager, when I felt we were in the right place.  She was so gracious, gave us all the information we needed, and took us on a tour of the facility.  We saw all the options without being rushed, and we were very impressed with the cleanliness, the well lit aisles, and all the security measures one would want.  Boxes are available, as well as it being an Amazon Locker location, where your packages can be delivered to a secure spot for pickup.  I can't say enough about this storage facility. First stop and no reason to look further.</Text>

< Review>
As an active duty military member with over 20yrs of service, I have had to move around ALOT. Inevitably, I always need a storage unit. When I arrive in California I was a bit blown away with pricing here and was nervous about my choice in facilities. After some research, it was a no brainier that Secure Public storage in San Ramon was the place for me. Not only did they beat out the prices for the same size unit (10x10) then a place closer to me but they had all the rest of the creature comforts I was looking for. 1. Super clean. 2. In a busy safe area. 3. Cameras. 4. Individual security per storage unit. Not to mention, Dwayne was awesome! What a great guy. I would HIGHLY recommend doing business here!</Review>

The day I met Dwayne Townsend and his team, I knew that I was in very good hands. This particular group is extremely professional, knowledgeable and honest - all the right qualities. The facility itself is very well-located on Camino Ramon in San Ramon, and configured for maximum security. The only way to access individual storage units is by entering a security code which then gives you access to the building units from the inside - there is no external access, and the building is closed in the evenings to further deter break-in's. The storage units are climate controlled and well-maintained. There are no hidden fees, and monthly rates are extremely reasonable. -Hands down, a superior facility with an excellent team!.

We chose Security Public Storage because they offered a secure and climate controlled facility. The substantial winter/spring time promotion helped make the pricing even more appealing at a time we had a lot of expenses getting our home ready for sale. The manager Wanda never complained when we almost routinely arrived shortly before closing and never made us feel rushed, although we did rush ourselves out to respect the closing hours. Wanda also took some weight off my shoulders by offering to work directly with my insurance agent on getting the required documentation in order to waive there minimum monthly insurance charge. That was much appreciated especially since it was at a very busy time during our home sale transaction and our trying to secure viable rental housing. Wanda also referred me to a dependable and reasonable hauling service and even stayed a bit late waiting for my husband to come when we had inquired earlier in the day as to what time the facility was closing. Wanda has always greeted us cheerfully and genuinely has our best interest at heart offering little bits of helpful information when we have had an opportunity to speak with her in the front office. I would encourage anyone looking for a clean, safe, comfortable and well lit storage facility at a competitive price to consider Security Public Storage.<//Text>

The facility is incredibly clean. The on-site management is friendly as well. Climate controlled units are great for storing personal art and photos and anything else you need the space for. Prices are competitive and online specials are awesome!</text>

What a pleasant experience!  Circumstances found us needing climate controlled storage.  Being new to the area, we had little to go by except on-line reviews.  We decided to give Security Public storage a try, after conversing with Dwayne, we knew we had our solution.  Dwayne not only showed us our actual unit, but demonstrated the operation of the security system.  Dwayne was professional, polite and made the check-out process easy and seamless.  To date we are thrilled with our choice.  Not only are we assured the safety and condition of possessions but have the pleasure of dealing with a professional, customer oriented service.  Well Done!<//review>

They have climate control, 24 hour surveillance, well stocked packing and moving paraphernalia for purchase at great rates.  The best thing is the customer service.  Lisa and Bruce are Awesome.  They will take care of you and set you up with the right storage facility that meets your needs.  They take their time with you and every client they work with.  And you will walk away with a bonus if you end up conversing with them; they are full of knowledge about all kinds of topics and full of resourceful information.

We recently moved and we found security storage. Great place, excellent staff, reasonable. We found it to be very clean and convenient. The temperature controlled units are a added plus. They also provide carts for easy loading and unloading. One other feature is their check in check out security feature.<//Review>

<Text>I need a climate-controlled storage unit for work and this place is the best! Conveniently located off Crow Canyon and 680, it's easy to access. They have security cameras everywhere, a security code panel entry, and the facility is closed/locked at night, so I feel confident that my stuff is safe at Security Public Storage. Highly recommend!<//Text>< pictures>

Highly recommend this storage facility in San Ramon.  Have been using their services for years both when in the area and not.

- Convenient to some central roads but still quiet and safe
- Clean, climate-controlled units that are easy to access from exits
- Good security and facility notifications through e-mail
- Competitive prices with automated payment and monthly updates
- Lisa and Bruce are amazing staff and wonderful people

Would definitely use their services again!< /text>

My son was relocating from Austin TX and he told me he wanted to put his furniture in storage until further details were settled. I inspected 3 storage facilities before looking at Security Public Storage in San Ramon. The facility was so much superior to the other places that I stopped looking and chose Security. I was shown several units and the first thing I noticed was the cleanliness of all of them.< /Text>

Honestly I don't have a lot of experience with storage facilities, but this was so easy that I would never want to go anywhere else! I've heard great things about their climate control and so far It's been awesome! I worked with Jonah Bergevin and he was very friendly and professional.< /review>

<text>I have been looking for the best pediatric office for my younger children and I found it! Dr. Cat is the nicest dentist and person. She took her time and she was extremely patient with my children who are both under the age of 10. She understands the importance of building a relationship with the child and parent. She took her time cleaning their teeth and her evaluation.

I would recommend this place hands done 1000%! Great location, clean, and friendly staff. Thank you so much Dr. Cat!< /text><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None</Resp><gmapID>0x80c29c217046e7ab:0xe5c9ea703de4a344<//gmapID></record>

<Review>I cannot say enough about Dr. Catherine Guerrero, My daughter woke up with a severe pain at 6:30 am in her lower left . I search for pediatric dentist on yelp and her office pop up , the front office manager was super helpful when I called in about a dental emergency and they were able to fit me in today. The most important thing about Dr cat and the tooth office was she explained everything she was doing to my child, step by step. I’ve never felt more confortable and relaxed taking my child to a dentist . Sonia , Dr .Catherine assistant was so friendly, efficient, and very patience.  THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING PROFESSIONAL, CARING AND LOVING WITH THE CHILDREN. Dr. Catherine is TRULY A GREAT PEDIATRIC DENTIST DOCTOR much love and care for you child. I will recommend this place to anyone and everyone.< /Review>< pics>

Just to put things in perspective- our last doctor’s appointment was full of screaming and crying. I would definitely recommend Dr. Cat to anyone looking for a great pediatric dentist. She made his first trip to the dentist such a pleasant experience! Thanks Dr. Cat + staff.< /review>< pics>

It is always a pleasure to visit Dr. Cat and her team. She tries to keep everyone happy all day long, AND she does excellent work! She’s compassionate and understanding, and tries to stay on the cutting edge of technology.
I would recommend anyone and everyone to Dr. Catherine Guerrero and her team because they provide outstanding services. I’ve had traumatic dentist experiences in my time, and I’m no longer fear going to the dentist AT ALL.
I’m a college student pursuing to become a future dentist. Dr. Cat’s professionalism and excellence motivates me to one day be like her. An AMAZING dentist.</text>

We are so grateful we found Dr Cat! My two year old was terrified and initially cried (probably recalling last year's disaster of a first dental appointment at another practice) but quickly calmed as he realized the staff weren't going to force him to do anything he wasn't ready for. They were so gentle, friendly, warm, and patient he settled in and got thru the appointment painlessly. They allowed me to sit with him and he just leaned back and let the hygienist (who was so gentle and kind) and later the beautiful Dr Cat clean and examine his teeth. After he was done, Dr Cat educated us on dental hygiene and tooth development, and when she told us they had toys and sugar-free lollipops, my son hopped onto the ground and excitedly followed her out of the room like they'd been best friends forever! He chose his car toy, took a lolllipop, and walked out like he'd just had a fun play date. We are actually excited to come back in six months and see Dr Cat again. What a gift to have a pediatric dentist who you can tell right away she truly loves children, is warm and kind, has a great sense of humor and personality, and honors families. Highly recommend for anyone looking for their dream dentist for the kids!</Text>

Wow! This Dr and her staff are all amazing and so sweet. I’ve never had this luck where the entire office are patient and sweet. My son had three teeth extracted today and still said he loves the place. That says a lot. They are all great at explaining everything and giving visuals before procedures.< /Review>

We have loved every appointment (3) we’ve had with Dr. Cat. We transferred from a different dentist office in 2020 that claimed to be pediatric and was NOT. Dr. Cat & her staff are so good with kids and every room and tool has been chosen with them in mind. I’m so very thankful and impressed.< /Review>

BEST kids dentist EVER!! We went to Dr Cats for a 2nd opinion after my daughter’s regular dentist recommended general anesthesia & a ton of dental work. Dr Cats was able to get all my daughters dental work done pain free, no shots, no loud tools, no anesthesia!! Dr Cats & Ms Tish are super kind, friendly, and know how to keep a 4 year old happy & comfy while spending an entire hour in the chair!! I 1,000,000 recommended them!<//text>

Wonderful pediatric dental office!!  I took my very-nervous 13-year-old daughter in for some extractions in preparation for braces, and we had the BEST experience.  Dr. Cat was SO kind, patient, encouraging.  I would highly recommend her!!<//text>

My 2yr old needed some fillings today, and the dentist was so sweet. She did her best to rally my babe, offered some toys and her favorite show, and also was RESPECTFUL about the experience. She offered to stop after the first filling since my girl wasn’t feeling it (read hysterical!) because she is little and was overwhelmed and overtired. Dr Cat stayed calm and gentle all the way the through, and that’s the best I could ask for. Kids are kids, sometimes happy, sometimes scared, but I always felt Dr Cat remained cool, confident and in control. As a bonus—the office was beautiful, nicely decorated for Halloween and so clean! Thank you!<//text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><review>Recently, we found out our daughter had a cavity in her tooth. The dentist recommended us to a specialized children’s dentist which was Cat. Not only did our daughter absolutely love her and her staff, but she got to watch cartoons the entire time they worked on her teeth and then she got all kinds of fun stuff afterwards. Nothing can replace a happy kid after a dentist appointment that could be a super scary experience. Thank you so much to Cat and your entire team!!! We highly recommend this business.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None</resp>< gmap_id>

To find a great dentist is challenging.  Dr. Cat definitely gets a 5 plus rating. Not only is she professional, she is thorough and patient! Her staff definitely know how to work well with children! The office is well maintained. I recommend Dr. Cat to anyone who has children, especially children with special needs!!<//Text>

My toddler loves Dr. Cat she is super engaging with him. However the staff needs to work on greeting people when they arrive. I have gone now three times and each time no hello, no how are you? nothing. It may be they perform multiple duties in the office such as cleaning teeth and checking people in. But a warm welcome goes along way.<//Review>

Great experience thus far. I called Dr.Cat's office to schedule an appointment and I was given a same day appointment for my 19 month old and 4 y/o. We didn't have to wait long before we were tended to and they took great care of my little ones and adjusted treatment routines for my 19 month. I really appreciated the fact that Dr.Cat and her assistant personalized care for each of my boys.<//text>

Dr Cat is truly extraordinary at caring for our littles teeth. Our 6yr old daughter has cavities between her back teeth and required a crown. dr cat offered us a number of treatment options and listened and handled our needs with sensitivity and care. Our daughter has no fear going to see dr cat as the experience is always pleasant and she takes great care to really listen to her patients (and their parents).
Best pediatric dentist - hands down!!</Review>

My girls love Dr. Cat!  She is so sweet and understanding with the kids. My oldest daughter had a cavity that needed treatment and she had a panic attack when it came time for it and Dr. Cat was patient and willing to work with my daughter until she was able to relax and breathe through it. Since then my daughter can’t wait to go see Dr. Cat. Thank you for all you do!!< /Review>

Dr. Cat has an excellent approach to her practice.  After our first visit, my 12 and 10 yr boys said she reminded them of their beloved Aunt. She was super nice and caring and thats why they felt that way.  Her diagrams and images help any parent understand the road ahead.  Dr. Cat is the best.< /review>

I highly recommend Dr. Cat! My little girl needed some treatment and Dr. Cat plus her amazing team worked their magic and were so compassionate and comforting to my little girl.

There was no need to put my little girl to sleep like other Dr's suggested. She's very honest, detailed and shows empathy. My little girl watched her favorite movie and was able to raise her little hand when she needed a little break.

I'm very grateful to have found a Dr. that's so caring to the little children she treats. Thank you Dr. Cat, I wish I could give this review more than 5 ☆☆☆☆☆☆☆<//text>

I was nervous. I am a new mom and it was time for my 2 year old to see the dentist. You walk in and see a very clean and tidy waiting area, this made us feel safe since the pandemic is still going on. The receptionist was extremely kind and patient. She took our temperatures before entering the rooms. They have a cool set up where they have a screen in front of the patient chair and my son was so excited he kept asking for Peppa Pig and they had it! They were warm, friendly and allowed him to just be a kid. My son is an explorer and wanted to touch and see everything in that office and they were so kind to let him! Dr. Cat is kind, energetic and helpful. She explained how his teeth will be coming in, what to pay close attention to and how to take care of our child teeth! She answered all my questions and addressed all my concerns. The visit could not have gone better. I HIGHLY recommend this dentist.</Text>

I highly recommend Dr. Cat if you’re looking for a pediatric dentist. My daughter was in pain and needed treatment. We had a bad experience at another dental office before, so I was nervous this time. I found out about Dr. Cat through my insurance. I called and they were able to schedule her the very next day in the morning! Staff and Dr. Cat were SO AMAZING!! The Dr. is so good with kids; She walked my daughter through every step of the way and made her feel beyond comfortable. That really put me at ease! Dr. Cat made the process fun for her too. She is really patient and super sweet. Staff are very friendly and helpful as well. I live about 50 minutes away from Dr. Cat’s office, but the drive was well worth it. I can’t express enough gratitude for their great service. Such a good experience!< /text>

It was a Referal from another dentist and At first after I mapquest it it was very far away so I almost cancel but this place was worth the 20 minute drive.

Omg seriously it’s the place for kids. Amazing staff. People. Dentist doctor.

Amazing office window view. Toy and a rose 🌹 they gave my son to give to his mom for Mother’s Day.

Dr. Cat is excellent with kids, care, and providing a thorough diagnosis. It’s a great facility with a great staff.  The only concerning thing about our visit today was that they were doing construction during office hours and the workers were not wearing proper masks (handkerchiefs) while kids had their mouths wide open just feet away.< /text>

<Review>I'm so glad I found Dr. Cat. I love this office, and my kids, despite their terrible teeth, love going to the dentist. Dr. Cat takes the time to really explain the best plan for my kids' dental issues. She'll never offer unnecessary treatments and really has her patients' best interest in mind. She's gentle and patient... plus, she has popsicles, toys and stickers! What more can a person ask for in a dentist for their kids?< /Review>< Date>

Dr. Cat and staff did an excellent job. I was very happy with my son's dental appointment. He was able to go through all the x-rays without gagging which he has never done at any other place. Dr. Cat was professional and friendly.< /Text>

Dr. Cat is hands down the best. My girls love coming to her for their visits. Takes her time with the kids and makes them feel comfortable and is great at explaining the treatment plan which makes us as parents feel more at ease.</Text>

My first visit today was great. Dr. Cat is very knowledgeable & my 6 years old did well with oral exam. We are scheduled for 2 weeks so we can proceed with few preventive treatments. Also, big thank you to the front desk to make scheduling easy.</text>

My daughter was deathly afraid to go to the dentist but their staff had such a sweet and gentle approach and the individual tv screens also helped! When it turned out my daughter had cavities I thought there was no way she would cooperate however, dr cat and her team worked their magic and my daughter was able to feel at ease.</text>

The kids were greeted with big smiles, they only did what the kids were comfortable with so they would have a good experience and fond memory of their appt, and they even handed out lollipops when they were finished (which had VEGGIES in them btw so really they are for us, right parents?) This place is a gem and we are so happy to have found it! Highly recommend.</Review><Resp>None</Resp><Date>1602819397690< /Date>< rate>

Dr. Cat was so kind. She was extra patient with my 18 month old who was screaming at first but by the time we left she was a happy camper! I’m planning on bringing my older kids next time. She offers an in house dental plan that is very doable. I highly recommend her practice.

UPDATE: Is it normal for my now 3 year old to be this excited to visit her dentist?! Dr. Cat is a super star in her eyes. My older kids now 16 and 17 love her, too.</text>

<Review>My 3 year old son normally hates dentists. He starts crying as soon as we walk in the office- we went to dr cats today for the first time & he had a blast! He was having fun watching his iPad & talking to the front desk person.

When we went into the exam room he lost it, but was calm watching the tv they have attached to the chair - watching paw patrol. Dr cat was super friendly & helpful on information & understanding if my son didn't wanna do something.

After, she took him to go get a frisbee and toys! He had so much fun he was going behind the desk to find a new toy haha . The front desk lady was able to get us an appointment for his treatment quickly & understanding and reassuring that we were doing everything right! They gave me all the information & copies of documents for me. I love them so much!!

I will definitely be recommending dr cats office to everybody I know that has kids!! They're amazing with my son and I'm so glad I found them!</Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

Dr. Cat is the best dentist I have ever met in my life. She is a true caring honest person that I will make the drive to see for our daughters.
We LOVE her and her kid friendly office, staff and she does her homework to help you guide making the best decision for your child. She is amazing and I pray God Bless her with just kind patients.< /Review>

<text>This pediatric dental group goes above and beyond to give my kids the best care. The women and men in this office clearly love what they do. My kids feel comfortable here and love going to get their teeth counted and cared for. Our last visit was my 18-month-old’s first visit. Because of the kind a d relaxing atmosphere, my daughter did great. Dr. Cat and her tooth fairies are incredible!< /text></record></dataset><record>

<Review>My daughters and I have visited Dr. Cat two times so far and both times she's given us big, friendly hugs as if we've been seeing her for years. The office is clean, comfortable,  and welcoming. The staff is very kind and relational. Dr. Cat is great at putting young people at ease. I am grateful that each visit has been a happy,  positive experience - promoting in my children a willingness and excitement to go to the dentist for preventative care.<//Review>< response>

Dr. Cat and her team wonderful work! They’re so nice and understanding, they never pressure my son to do anything he doesn’t want to do. They take they’re time explaining and waited for him to get comfortable. We very much enjoy going to Dr. Cat and you will too!

Update: we took our 2 year old to Dr. Cat for her first dentist appointment. It was ridiculously easy. Even with all the COVID changes. It was still a great experience, with a positive attitude, and no parent shaming. And of course they never forget treats for the kids, nor the parking validation for the adults.</text>

Sonia, the dental hygienist, kindly explained each tool and step of the process to us and our two year old. She allowed our daughter to familiarize herself with the dentals tools to put her toddler fears at ease. Throughout the process, Sonia cleaned our daughter’s teeth quickly and efficiently. Dr. Cat struck the optimal balance of being professional and thorough while simultaneously exuding gentleness and kindness in her approach. Dr. Cat and her staff clearly care about their patients, their dental care, and their comfort level in this office. My husband and I both agree that we are thrilled to have found such a gem in Dr. Cat and the Tooth!<//text><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None< /Response><Time>1559100066938</Time></record>

Very positive experience. We will be going back again. A kid friendly office. Great video options for children. Keep up the good work!

We went again this year and had a terrific time. 5 star review easily.< /text>

<Review>The hygienist and Dr. Cat were very patient since my son wasn’t to keen on having half his month cleaned. They just kept trying different ways to encourage him to let them finish. Everyone is always very sweet and friendly in the office. I’m glad we found you guys.< /Review>< pics>

Dr. Cat was amazing and very patient with my daughter, as well as the staff and the lady at the front desk. My daughter got X-rays, a cleaning, and a tooth extraction. I was very worried that it would be a traumatizing experience, like when I took her to Western Dental to get work done. My daughter felt at ease and comfortable with Dr. Cat. The dental office had a TV for the kids in every room, so that they can be distracted and watch a show when they get work done. My daughter also played with the toys in the waiting room. She loved this dental office so much, that she hugged Dr. Cat after her dental procedure. I was very pleased, and I will be coming here from now on.<//Text>

Took my 2 year old daughter and 6 year old son to Dr Cat today and they handled my son so well. He was a little apprehensive but they calmed him and handled him with such compassion and care! My daughter had no fear and both enjoyed there experience in the office. The staff and Dr. Cat are fabulous, the office is so clean and kid friendly with toys in the waiting room and a treasure chest of rewards for the kids after there exam. I highly recommend Dr. Cat.< /text>

It's no wonder she has a 5 ⭐ review from 100's of patients.  Devyn did well for his 1st dental visit and had 0 cavities. Dr. Cat and staff welcomed my 2 year old and played with him while I was filling out paperwork and he enjoyed them so much.
Afterward,  he enjoyed his all natural,  sugar free,  veggie/fruit lollipop with a big smile. 🍭 😍😘</Review>< Pics>

Dr. Cat was amazing as well as her staff! She is truly something special and I will recommend her to anyone in need of a dentist for their children.  From the phone call with Renee I felt comfortable bringing my son in and it was a 5 star treatment start to finish!

<text>Dr. Cat and her staff are so personable and professional. They made my 3 year old son feel so comfortable at his visit to "the tooth doctor." Dr. Cat and her staff explained things to my son in terms he understood and made him feel so comfortable with all the tools they were using. I can't recommend this team highly enough.<//text>< pics>

<Review>Dr. Cat and her crew are amazing. Each of my three girls have some difficulties trusting others, but over time (4 years now) they have no problems getting their teeth cleaned. Dr. Cat has the greatest amount of respect and patience for both children and parents. Her staff has been great at encouraging my girls to be brave through teaching them about the tools and what procedure will be done. I love when adults treat my children as smart learners. We also got great advice on all the insurance policies offered.

<Text>Dr. Cat was very caring. She took her time to explain things to me in details and did not rush us and answered all my questions. It was my first visit there, my daughter's face was swallown. She did all the necessary tests that needed to be done. After we left her office, the next day she called me personally to follow up, which meant a lot to me.</Text>< pics>

Dr. Cat was absolutely amazing and the staff was perfect. My six year was very nervous about her appointment and everyone in the office made her feel so comfortable. From the waiting room to the exam room, everything was very clean and well maintained. The staff even made me feel comfortable. The dentist is usually a dreaded place but this office was nothing short of excellent. I recommend this place to anyone looking for a safe and pleasant office for their children.< /review>

<review>Dr. Catherine Guerrero and her staff are amazing people. The moment we walked in the room, it was an instant of welcoming and loving environment. My son suffers from anxiety and he does not do well in medical or dental offices. He will not let anyone near his mouth, however, Dr. Guerrero and her staff were able to make my son feel very comfortable and at ease. They give hope and really do care about their patients and will not do anything that would scare them. I feel more comfortable that my son is more open to dental work. We are grateful that we were recommended to Dr. Guerrero’s office.   :D<//review>< UserId.>

Dr. Cat is so good with our son. He’s nine and autistic - he needs to take breaks and everyone handles his needs with sensitivity and expertise.  He had a great visit and is learning to enjoy his trips to the dentist!  That’s a big accomplishment.<//Review>

Dr. Cat and her staff are fantastic! My 6-year-old was nervous about his appointment, but left asking if he could go again tomorrow! He’s disappointed that he has to wait a whole 6 months to go back! Lol!
The staff and Dr. Cat did a great job comforting my son while giving him a thorough exam and cleaning. Dr. Cat was so warm and inviting, and took special care to discuss my son’s dental health with both my son and me (even explaining with comparison photos for reference, which was helpful).
The office is VERY clean and decorated very cute. We absolutely loved our experience with Dr. Cat and her team!< /review>

I found Dr Cat through research I made online and I'm so happy I found such a wonderful Dr. My daughter felt so comfortable in her office that is very clean and smells good ( was important for my daughter) she took care of my daughter so well she always smiles and so patient and very very professional!! My daughter had 2 major procedures which took more than 2 hours ea h time and also cavity and Dr Cat was beyond expectations. Her staff is great too and very helpful.
My daughter had some bleeding after treatment and Dr Cat gave me her private cellphone to call for any problem any time and you know she means that. Sbe always hugs us and give us worm feeling so my daughter has no problem going there even when she knew the procedure won't be that easy...Really wonderful Dr and staff We love her and  had great experience!!<//review>

Let me start by saying my son 3 1/2 years old and is not an easy child.  He overheard me discussing his upcoming appointment earlier in the week and he already started having a fit about going even though he had never been before.  This is why I was blown away by how WONDERFUL his first experience was at the dentist and can’t thank Dr. Cat and her team for making my son feel so welcomed, having such an amazing environment for him to feel at ease, explaining everything to him in a fun way, letting pick out his favorite flavor of toothpaste for his cleaning, putting on his favorite Netflix kids show, allowing me to sit in the chair with him for the first part of his appointment. I mean we just had the most amazing experience that by the end of the visit my son said DR. CAT WAS HIS BEST FRIEND as we got in the car.  I really feel that they set him up for success for future visits and his dental health.  We can’t wait to go back.</review>

<Review>Dr Cat and her associates were so great with my kids. Both my 6 and 9 year old felt comfortable and safe the entire time. She cleaned their teeth, did X-rays, put sealant on their molars, and had to get rid of a tiny cavity. I felt like she was knowledgeable, and genuinely cared about my kids wellbeing and dental health. She took her time with explaining what was happening, how to take the best care of their teeth and it was an overall great experience for both my kids and myself.<//Review>< Pictures>

First time visiting today - Ms. Cat and her staff are amazing! My daughter had to come in due to an emergency, and with no hesitation they told me to come right in! We’ve definitely found a dentistry for our kids and I’m so happy I’ve found them!

My kids can’t stop taking about their experience.

Thank you ladies!<//review>

<Text>We love Dr. Cat and her team! Our daughter is 21 months and on her second visit, she had her teeth cleaned and flossed without a whimper. The office is super clean and the room we were in had a TV so it was a nice distraction for our toddler.<//Text><Response>None<//Response>< pics>

<text>I never do the comments on these things but I have to this time because the doctor and her staff are Amazing! I took my son there to get his teeth worked on and he was really nervous and hates going to the dentist because of a previous bad experience he had at another office. The doctor and her staff were so informative, nice and caring. They really took the time to make sure my son was doing ok and comfortable the entire time we were there and I am very pleased with the work that was done on his teeth. When we left Doctors Cats office my son was happy and wanted to go back the following week.<//text><GmapID>0x80c29c217046e7ab:0xe5c9ea703de4a344</GmapID>< name>

Always the best. Felt very safe with check in procedures, we were notified to come up from the car when the office was clearer and dental chair ready for my son. Dr Cat Is always impeccable, we have gone for 3 years now, she helps us get everything done when I have the day off work. My son thinks she’s the nicest dentist and was even laughing and dancing during his procedure last year.< /text>

<text>Dr. Catherine is really terrific. She makes the experience fun and does not try to rush any procedures that your child may not be ready for. Her motto is "if he or she will let me". That creates a trust that is crucial in childrens dentistry. I highly recommend Dr. Cat and her staff, your kids will love them.</text>< Name>

We had our 1st dentist visit ever and my twins did great thanks to the extremely friendly staff and Dr. Cat. Amazing all around. The kids were anxious and excited going in and even more excited when we were done. They said it was FUN! :) Quick, comfortable, efficient visit; Clean bill of dental health, lots of bright shiny smiles and we will definitely be going back! I couldn't be more happy with the experience my kids (age 3) had today with Dr. Cat.</review>

Dr. Cat is the best! I followed her from another office because she was the best dentist there and when she was gone I knew I had to track her down. I’m so thrilled I found her new office. My 6 year old son had a bad fall and needed help with his injury and Dr. Cat has been patient, understanding and so loving with him. And she’s been amazing with me when I was frustranted and didn’t understand why certain procedures had to be done. I’m so pleased with her and her work.<//text>

Our son's first dentist visit, and Dr. Cat and her team made it as smooth as humanely possible. Sweet, sensitive, and understanding. Office is very clean and welcoming.  Can't wait for our second visit.</text>

<Text>I was expecting my son to cry again for the 3rd time but my wife and I were so surprised when he didn't cry during his appointment and it is largely thanks to Dr. Cat!

Dr. Cat and her staff are awesome! My 3 year old son started to cry once we went into a room. The nurse was patient, calm, and the best at making my son not feel nervous. They are a great team, and I will be taking my son back there.< /Review>

Depends on the assistant. The dentist is amazing. She listens to your concerns as well as diagnosing and treating efficiently. Very friendly. Very critical. It seems that her office also trains dental technicians. Could be a good thing to properly train new technicians. Her office staff is amazing. Could also be a bad thing if the parent/guardian is not present. I advise staying with your child while with an unfamiliar face. The dental assistant might be new and has not learned all the amazing tricks of the office yet.<//review>

<Review>After a pretty scary dental experience as a child, I was worried for my 5 year old when she starting getting cavaties, despite our best efforts. Dr. Cat came highly reccommended, and I can definitely see why. My 5 year old, who is very shy and on the spectrum, was excited about the toys in the waiting room, and felt comfortable enough to start playing from the get go. The staff was incredible. Despite being a child who never leaves her momma, my little girl felt comfortable enough and loved the staff enough to go back to her room by herself while I took care of an insurance issue. The absolute highlight was Dr. Cat. From the moment she entered the room, it was like a ray of sunshine walked in. My daughter was immediately at ease some some sort of magic, and was happy to go along with whatever she suggested. Dr. Cat made things so easy to understand, and when i was feeling terrible for my little girl's situation, she really put me at ease and explained how there are so many factors that we cannot control that lead to these things, and even gave me a hug when I got teary eyed with relief. Everyone had great things to say as bout my little girl, which made us both feel so loved and accepted. And everyone went above and beyond for the best customer service I have had since we moved to Cali 4 months ago.

If you are worried about your child, please consider Dr. Cat. I've never felt more comfortable or at peace over someone taking care of my little girl. ♡♡♡<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None< /resp><gmap_id>0x80c29c217046e7ab:0xe5c9ea703de4a344</gmap_id></record>

So glad we found this place! Dr. Cat is amazing. My son was not a fan of his first dentist and Dr. Cat made him feel at ease. She is very warm and caring. The staff is always super friendly, welcoming and professional.  The office has a very comfortable feel vs. a doctor office. The waiting room has a good selection of toys to keep the kids entertained. Actually nice and unbroken toys! (The last place we went had overly nasty broken toys) The exam/patient rooms have TV's with Netflix so the kids can watch anything they want. Which in my mind is a total plus.< /Review>

<review>Dr Cat & her amazing staff have made going to the dentist something my 6 year old looks forward to—even after fillings! They do everything with your kid’s comfort in mind. They get to choose what they want to watch on tv while they get their teeth done, what flavors they want for the polish (they have cool flavors like marshmallow), & afterwards they get to choose a toy. Everyone is so kind & gentle here. I’m so glad we lucked out & found this place! 😊<//review><GmapID>0x80c29c217046e7ab:0xe5c9ea703de4a344< /GmapID>< username>

I can not say enough positive words about Dr. Cat and her entire office staff! She even brought a therapy dog in to help with my son’s anxiety! My son ended up needing to see a specialist and she took the time to call around to find one who would see him and take our insurance. Talk about above and beyond... so grateful to have found this office!!!< /text>

If anyone is looking for a Professional and child friendly environment, the Dr Cat is the women you need to see. Dr Cat and her staff are 1st class. When you schedule a appointment, thats it! No waiting 30mins and then your child is seen. Clean office space and our very knowledgeable staff help you feel relaxed. I have recommended her to lots of friends.

I loved them, my son had a traumatic experiance before and them knowing this made it better.  First  took him to teddy bear  dentistry in West Hills  and when he was not Cooperative they ended up holding him down  asking me to quiet him down because he was scaring the patients  so I stopped  the appointment  and they decided not to charge me due to the negative experience. I then decided to take him to my dentist dr. Gregory Turk who has worked on my teeth for over 13 years so that hopefully him knowing them would help the situation however it did not so they referred me to dr. Cat. The office of dr. Cat was able to get everything done without him having anxiety once he meet the employees and dr.. They made it a magical moment talking about fair dust. Which was a powder they state with his daily toothpaste. My son is very particular about his toothpaste and will only use one particular kind so I thought it would be helpful to bring it and they were able to use that toothpaste mixed in that powder to clean his teeth.< /Review>

<review>Went by this place today (Sunday) and it was closed up tight  Their hours on Google say open today and one of their two signs with hours says they're open on Sunday. The other one has no hours listed for Sunday. Kinda sneaky, right? And, not cool if you're the one who drove all of the way there.
Called while sitting in their parking lot and no answer either. Bad customer service.< /review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPH81R0MLSCfA4M4H4sjqdj3iRNQlNXRxEYtl1L=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics>< response>

I had a great experience at Florin Cell Phone Outlet. They fixed my phone swiftly with affordable prices. Also my girlfriend bought a phone and they gave her a screen protector for free. The staffs there were so friendly, professional and helpful. I will keep going there. All l can say thank you so much for your warm hospitality and service. LOVE THIS PLACE!</review>

They saved my phone. Verizon and the geek squad at Best Buy were useless and wouldn't even try to help. This place is super awesome. Good staff and quick service. I am grateful.<//text>

<Review>Amir is the best...we have done business many times and I have never left disappointed of feeling like I got ripped of or taken advantage of.I have been a satisfied customer since they first open the doors of this business and anytime someone is looking for a phone or phone repair I always send them here. Best service and price that's why I give them 5 solid stars!< /Review>< time>

Called them 5 times 3 of those times they hung up on me 2 they just let it ring. After they finally picked up they told me they couldn’t buy my phone and just hung up. Didn’t even wait for me to respond. Worst place. Don’t go.<//Review>

It i could give 0 stars, i would. This place is a joke. They took my phone for repair, installed wrong part, made me wait 1 week when they clearly told me it would take 2 days. On top of that they said they installed new battery, they did not, they charged me for it thou.. DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THIS PEOPLE.. BUNCH OF THIEVES.<//text>

DO NOT TAKE YOUR PHONE HERE!!
I took my IPhone here to get the screen fixed and they messed up my battery! Smfh my battery wouldn't charge higher than 10% and they gave me a dam 5c which was a down grade. Now the 5c doesn't even work good it powers off on its own l. Plus this shop reeks of weed smoke like they smoke in the shop and they have puppies and dogs running around one puppy was chewing my shoe while I was waiting. Very unprofessional and they RUIN your devices! STAY AWAY!!< /text>

Wow i just called  this metro store location to bring my business to them  but never mind..
They don't even know how to answer the call to a customer.. The person who answered  just said
(Hello wait)  to me and he just hung up on me. So this store it's not for me.< /Text>

(Translated by Google) This place does not compare with others, they really treat it as a client should be treated, personal attention, and also know the needs of the Hispanic community, without thinking, or doubting it!
I recommend it.

A small intimate beautiful park overlooking San Diego Bay. Like a hidden treasure.  I got married here 2014. No charge under 25 people at that time. Overlooking downtown and boats going by.</review>

< Review>
It was my first time coming to Bayview Park today to have a picnic with my boyfriend and I couldn't get over the scenery of the city from where I was sitting. There was a sign on the ground that said about keeping their dogs on leashes which should be enforced because there were a lot of big dogs running around and fighting other big dogs. The only bad thing was that every 5 minutes, a cop car would pass by us to check what we were doing but we were just eating. Other than that, I really wanna come back again especially when they have movie night.< /Review>

This spot in Coronado is the most relaxing spot ever. It it completely silent the only sound you hear is the waves crashing into the rocks with a soothing fizz. You could bring your family or partner here to just have a good talk or just enjoy the view and relax. There are benches for you to sit and stare right into the abyss of the ocean and just over the horizon is downtown. Very accessible with parking and almost never packed.<//Text>

My husband and I got married here a few years ago. Fantastic spot for a small informal quick ceremony at sunset and no permit was necessary for under 20 people. Absolutely gorgeous skyline and super quiet!<//Text>

Please note that this is a very small park, and that fishing is not legal here. The rocks behind the houses on 1st Street are privately owned by the houses, which is why the rocks look different behind each house. We didn't notice that. A homeowner called the police on fishermen who went on the rocks and they were ticketed for trespassing and fishing without a license. One of the guys said he didn't have any identification with him, and that conversation didn't go well with the police and miraculously he found his ID. Bayview Park ends where the houses around it begin, please be aware of that. Also as I am typing this (June 26) Bayview Park is actually CLOSED and will be closed for the next few weeks--- Not due to Corona but due to a sewer repair that required a complete excavation.<//review>

Small park located in Coronado right on the shore. You have great views of San Diego, bridge, boats crossing, sea birds, and much more. You can get great shots of the city as the sun goes down.</Text>

<Review>Bay View Park is a small, secluded shoreline park with shade trees, benches and nice landscaping on the island of Coronado. The park is named after the great views it offers of the downtown skyline and bay at this almost secret location. When you are on the bench at this place, the rest of the world drops away behind and around you and makes the views of San Diego “pop out” even more.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>

This is one of the nicest places on the island to just sit and enjoy the peace. I've spent a lot of my life on Coronado and, even though I didn't live here, it will always hold a very special place in my heart. Go pick a bench, sit and enjoy the small moment of stillness in your life.< /review>

Clean, well maintained park with 3 benches.  The view is terrific of the downtown San Diego skyline and is a perfect place for a small gathering.  It is small, roughly the size of a house lot so not much room for much else than a short walk.<//review>

I've been enjoying this area for over 30 years..
And the best part about it, has always been the view and solitude...
Keep in mind this is a very small area inset between two homes...
Always be respectful and quiet, and please pick up after youself...</text>< Pictures>

<Text>I live here, grew up across the street.  Played lots of capture the flag where one base was this park.  If i had any problems with this park its that everyone is always getting married here, its normally filled with lots of drunk people that in no way live on the island.   I have lots of memories here but its far to popular now.  At least its no longer a gay sex meet up.<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None< /response><GmapID>0x80deacaddb8f0b7b:0x55d50f60e7e36130<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Though very small place and it may not look like a park. It is nestled between big houses. But view of downtown is great. Very peaceful place to catch fresh air with view of San Diego.<//Review>

<Review>Views may not be quite as perfect as the main park a few blocks down, but they’re still very good, and it’s a little less crowded feeling even though it’s smaller.

(Translated by Google) Beautiful place, just please be considerate, as this park and beach are close to family houses, etc. At the same time, enjoy the beautiful view of the burgher skyscrapers.

Krásné místo, jen se, prosím, chovejte ohleduplně, neboť tento park a pláž je v těsné blízkosti rodinným domům atd. Zároveň si tu užijte krásný výhled na měšťanské mrakodrapy.

<Review>(Translated by Google) Very nice view, at night it is much better because you see the lights of San Diego.

Really nice, in the night its even better ´cause you can see the lights of San Diego.

<text>(Translated by Google) TIP! Optimal holiday photos in front of the San Diego skyline! Whether during the daytime in the sunshine or at night with illuminated skyscrapers, do not miss these pictures!

My special tip: You can combine the journey with a roundtrip: from downtown to the south, across the Mexican border to Tijuana (DO NOT drive!), Then a stop at the Imperial Beach Pier for a popsicle. Then from the south to Coronado to 1st Street to Bayview Park - not to be confused with the Centennial Park - take pictures and then drive in over the big Coronado Bridge back to San Diego.

Duration about 2-3 hours, but all the time in the car with stops to get out. Have fun!

(Original)
GEHEIMTIPP! Optimale Urlaubsfotos vor der Skyline von San Diego! Ob tagsüber bei Sonnenschein oder nachts mit beleuchteten Hochhäusern, lasst euch diese Bilder nicht entgehen!

Mein Special-Tipp: Ihr könnt die Anfahrt mit einem Roundtrip verbinden: von Downtown Richtung Süden, über die mexikanische Grenze nach Tijuana gucken (NICHT fahren!), danach einen Stop am Imperial Beach Pier für ein Eis am Stiel. Dann von Süden nach Coronado  zur 1st Street zum Bayview Park - nicht mit dem Centennial Park verwechseln - Fotos machen und nachher dann über die große Coronado Bridge wieder nach San Diego reinfahren.

Dauer ca. 2-3 Stunden, allerdings die ganze Zeit im Auto mit Stops zum Aussteigen. Viel Spaß!< /text>< username>

<userid>105108658992886070271</userid><Review>The staff was extremely accommodating. One item had not been sent from our doctors office that was needed in order to undergo the CT scan and they worked for 20 minutes, making calls and jumping through hoops to acquire this report. They did it!!! We didn’t have to reschedule, which was a relief because it was Friday and the test would have been delayed over the weekend. We are very relieved and appreciative for the attention and compassion we were shown.</Review></record></dataset><record>

The facility is very clean and the reception staff members were kind and helpful. The CT technician was respectful and informative. He was gentle when inserting the IV contrast and made sure that I knew what to expect throughout the test. It was a very positive experience.< /Review>

<Review>Everything and everyone was wonderful. As the first step towards chemo, it was quite comforting. Thanks to the nurses, the doctor who did my procedure, and the receptionist who wished me luck on my way out. Highly recommended.

<text>I received a HSG two months ago, from another location and it was a horrific experience. It was the most excruciating pain ever and I was told both fallopian tubes were blocked, and that I was infertile. I am healthy, mid thirties, never had a painful menses, and have not had any underlying conditions that made sense for me to have these blockages so my Dr wanted a second opinion. She referred me to Dr. Chin assuring me that technique matters and that he is one of the best. I was extremely hesitant when I arrived because of my previous experience. Hazel, Dr. Chin's tech, greeted me and showed me where to change, she provided clear and accurate instructions with a warm and reassuring approach. Next, Dr. Chin welcomed my husband into the room to address any questions prior to the procedure. Hazel and Dr. Chin talked me through everything, went slowly, and performed the procedure methodically and seemingly painlessly! Hazel held my hand and reminded me to breathe throughout the procedure. I experienced mild cramping however, it was brief and tolerable. Dr. Chin has a refined approach that truly makes a difference! And while I appreciate him making the experience so much more tolerable, he also diacovered that both fallopian tubes are actually open! So I was previously misdiagnosed, as suspected by my Dr. I am so thankful for
the second opinion, and I am grateful for experts in the field like Dr. Chin and Hazel!<//text>< user_name>

Gave this place 4 stars because the drs are super nice.  They took great care of my 1 year old, the lady at front desk check in was so sweet also she checked me in. However the other lady that is at front desk was super rude. Lobby and got a little full and she tried kicking me out. Now I understand due to covid or capacity I would need to leave. But the other girl with braces had her mask down the whole time and she could have asked a little nicer rather then bad attitude leaving me with uncomfortable while waiting for my 1 year old to get done with her mri. I don't know how these sweet drs or whoever hired her cause she clearly hates her job with her dirty looks and attitude ... I don't see any of that professional at all.</Review>

< Review>
The staff, the doctor and, his assistant were absolutely extraordinary. I came in quite anxious about having fluid removed from beneath my lung. Both the doctor and the assistant spoke to me in regards to what to expect. They answered any and all questions I had. When the doctor gave me the shots to numb the area I noticed that he had stepped back after a moment and just was watching the screen. I kept thinking he's waiting for the area to numb and within minutes or so it seemed or, less he simply said hold your breath and he said ...okay, you're done..... I didn't realize that they had removed a half a liter of fluid and I felt no pain, fear nor anxiety. Everyone, as I mentioned before, were absolutely extraordinary and Dr. Kashefi and his assistance, absolutely wonderful....🥀< /Review>

<Text>Crystal was so helpful in scheduling my daughter’s appt quickly after our insurance directed us to this facility. I was so anxious for our daughter’s MRI but that quickly disappeared with the professionalism and friendliness of Dr. Ekoff and Robyn. Everything was quick and painless and we had such a wonderful experience. Top notch facility and staff.< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None<//resp>< UserId.>

<Gmap_id>0x80c2982708f51cfb:0x90cedc279879e8a</Gmap_id><text>Not following Covid protocols. They had a sign on the door saying you could check in via text, but they did not reply to the text. So I went in, and the waiting room was very full. They had 2 people working at the reception area, side by side. That means that the patients need to stand next to each other as well, and not even close to 6 ft apart. The patient next to me had her mask on her chin, so I asked the receptionist to please ask the other patient to put her mask on. The receptionist tried, but the maskless lady and the other receptionist wouldn’t stop talking long enough to listen to the request. Eventually, the patient pulled up her mask (although she wasn’t happy about it).

They didn’t take the Covid precautions that other medical facilities routinely take. There were no “clean” pens for the paperwork. They didn’t do any temperature checks. They didn’t have any of the waiting area chairs blocked off so as to encourage distancing. They didn’t have those entering wash their hands or use hand sanitizer.

If I didn’t have a 12 year old on crutches with me, I would have left and rescheduled at another facility. But it is a huge effort to move my kid around at this time, so we just stayed and got it done. I won’t be returning.</text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

My experience was wonderful and I am especially grateful since my surgery at another facility from a week ago was pretty awful. Nurses Frank and Barbara took very good care of me. Frank was thorough with pre-OP details. Barbara and another nurse that I sadly didn't catch the name of, were very kind, friendly and empathetic. And of course Dr. Chin performed a quick and painless procedure, and was very warm and friendly. So nice to have had the last stage of my treatment, removal of my port, be accompanied by truly caring and fun staff :) Thank you so much!<//Text>

It was my first time being there. The receptionist was very professional, the time wait was amazing I only waited for like 5 minutes in the lobby, the ultrasound tech was very nice but the radiologist was simply the best! I was thereto get a thyroid biopsy and he made sure to walk me through every step and took his time. Thank you so so much.
My overall experience was awesome.< /text>

He is a rare person who is above excellence in his chosen career 🤩

A God send for any patient ; being treated well is a. gift that is healing in itself 💙

It’s second time I bring my mom to this clinic for MRI
Scheduling is worst, assistance doesn’t have any responsibilities for scheduling?
You know how long it takes time for each patient. Last week we were waiting 1 hour because you had another patient.

I do think it would be worthwhile, during COVID to advise patients that they can only have a single caretaker with them. There were many many people in a rather small waiting room and the poor receptionist/nurse had to ask people to leave as they signed in. A policy communicated when booking an appointment might alleviate that.</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

<text>These guys have it down good. I’ve been at several imaging places before and have had to wait hours past my appointment time for my imaging. Not this place. I was  early so they returned the favor and saw me early. I was a bit concerned about the MRI because of claustrophobia and a special accommodation I required. The technician was knowledgeable of my ”issues”  before I got there and we discussed them head.-on.  The scan went without a hitch and I was on my way back home in what seemed like no time. I Highly recommend these folks for your MRI Imaging needs. Professional and courteous staff, clean and well maintained facility and the waiting room was not overflowing. Yes!<//text>< pictures>

<text>I came 45 minutes early. The girl said there was one person in front of me. They didn’t call me back until my appointment time. Then the technician was nice and efficient and had me
in and out in 6 minutes flat. Go figure!!

<text>My visit with Dr. Chin was extremely satisfying.  He always does a great job.  He’s fast, professional, knowledgeable and compassionate but best of all his results are perfect.
His office and staff are a reflection of him as they too comply to the highest standards of excellence.</text><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

<text>This was one of my worst “medical” days I have experienced in 2 decades. I still have black & blue bruising from SEVERAL fumbled attempts to produce an IV pic line (for a w/contrast MRI) a week later. I can still remember my audible cries of pain after her last 4 attempts, both arms each...  Was it because I was there the day before a 3-day holiday weekend why I waited 1&1/2 hours to be seen for my appointment?

It was 3 hours later when I finally emerged Post-procedure with the front desk closed, dark with no souls in sight. Thankfully, my tech was able to rally an RN to give me my promised parking validation. Not a good day. Will be seeking another lab for my future services, but at least most of the staff were kind.</text><rating>1<//rating><Response>None</Response>< Pictures>

<Review>Had my bone marrow biopsy here on Friday. I love my nurses! Franco and Robin were the absolute best. They explained everything before, walked me through during, and made sure I was ok after. The whole clinic made you feel relaxed and comfortable despite the reason for your visit. They are so nice and super kind. I felt like a VIP because they treat you as a friend instead of a patient. They really go out of their way to make you a happy customer. Thank you for taking such good care of me!!!</Review><rate>5</rate><date>1576024952239</date><Resp>None</Resp>< userid>

I had an HSG done here with Dr. Chen. He and his team were absolutely wonderful. I'd done the same procedure a year prior at a different facility and had a horrible experience, so I was extremely nervous. The nurse and doctor both were excellent at listening to my concerns, getting a full picture of my history and then communicating clearly every step of the way. Unlike my previous HSG, this team works slowly in order to lessen pain as much as possible and they made an effort to get to know me, which helped immensely in letting me feel cared for rather than as if I were just a number. If I ever have need of radiology/imaging in future, I will make sure I go to them!<//Text>

Dr Chin and his nurse were fabulous.  They were kind and thoughtful, walked me through the whole procedure beforehand and were also very aware of my cues and how I felt during the procedure itself.  They also took the time with me after to show me the results.  Highly recommend, they were wonderful.< /Text>

The front desk check in girl was friendly as well. I’ve been going to SFV Interventional radiology for six years now. They are the ones that found and diagnosed me with breast cancer in October 2013 which did not show up on a mammogram at different facility.<//review>< Pictures>

Everyone was very friendly and helpful and answered all my questions. My procedure was late starting because of an issue with the procedure ahead of mine, but they kept me informed and made sure I was comfortable while I waited. My procedure went quickly and smoothly, and my experience was a good one.< /text>

I was very scared and nervous about the procedure I was going to have but from the moment I checked in I was treated super nice from every staff member.
They made me watch a video of the procedure I was about to have and made sure all my questions were answered. I’m very happy and blessed I was refer to this wonderful facility and I wouldn’t hesitate to come back if ever needed any further test. 😉< /Text>

Called to make an appointment for a liver biopsy and got an appointment a month later. The day before appointment we get a call that they reviewed the case and they made the wrong appointment. They make us wait 3 more weeks for another appointment. If that’s acceptable to you as a cancer patient then this is the perfect place for you. Teresa was the woman I spoke with and I can’t explain to you how careless and cold she was. It’s mind boggling how employees and health care providers can be so indifferent to those that are ill.< /text>

<text>I had an HSG conducted by Dr. Chin. For a procedure that is quite uncomfortable, he made it very easy with light humor and with some distraction (which was needed in this case). His assistant was also extremely kind (I hate that I forgot her name!) and warm in demeanor, so that will add to diffusing the nervousness. Everything was done gently and easily - I greatly appreciate all they did to get me through today.

The front office is also easy going and will make everything simple. Overall, great experience and appreciate all they did.</text></record>

Many thanks to Robin and Jared, who helped to ease my fears over my lung biopsy. Robin, you are the BEST!!   I was made to wait for a pretty long time, but that's almost to be expected. Thanks again.< /text>

This has been the most frustrating place to make an appointment. When they call to schedule your appointment, you get thrown into a voicemail situation As soon as you answer the phone, to then wait on hold for five minutes+ only to be told by the person who picks up that they don’t schedule what you need but they will transfer you. When they transfer, you have to go through the same voicemail-type call and wait on hold another five minutes or much more. Eventually you are able to leave a message. When they call back, you go through the same thing. Seriously? You called me!!</text>

<Name>G</Name><response>None</response><Review>Text and phone call reminder of appointment is awesome. I have been here a few times with my mother but this visit was different, possibly because I sat in the waiting room.. The employees seem more occupied with personal chit chat (not work related) amongst themselves .. maybe it was down time .. but a lot of talking. What really sucked is not knowing that they no longer validate parking. Yeah I should have asked cause it has been about 4 months since the last visit, but the office could've also let their patients know.

My mom's last visit was to get a chemo port put in. The nurse followed up after the appointment to check in on my mother - concern of the swelling and possible infection around the port .. kudos to the nurse ! She was quite attentive, whatever she explained she was thorough and clear. Loved dealing with her !< /Review>< rating>

Lauren and Theresa greeted me with smiles today and were very helpful. They were knowledgeable, answered all of my questions, and made me feel very comfortable. Jared was the tech who worked with me and he was so great! He informed me about what was to take place every step of the way. My appointment lasted exactly as long as they said it would and there was never any delay. This center has a great group of individuals!< /Text>

<Rating>3< /Rating><review>We had a really great experience here. Dr. Echoff (pediatric anesthesiologist) and his nurse, Robin should teach a class in bedside manner. They are so patience and wonderful with both children and parents. They kept us informed during our daughters MRI and we felt she was in great hands.<//review>< Pics>

< Review>
When I arrived for my appointment all the paperwork had been done and ready to be signed.  I was very early for my test and figured it would be a long wait  but I was taken ahead of schedule.  Both the Dr and tech explained everything in great detail as what would take place during testing and told me when my Dr. would get the final results. The office staff was very helpful and friendly and answered all my questions.  I would not hesitate to go to San Fernando Valley Interventional Radiology again.</Review>

<Review>I was there trying to do a CT scan. There was a misunderstanding which wasn’t the fault of this facility nor anybody in the company(Radnet) so I couldn’t do the scan.  I didn’t have the necessary medication to prevent an allergic reaction. Brandon tried so hard to help me out. He was sympathetic, kind and acted professionally. I really appreciate what he and his staff did for me. I couldn’t say enough ‘thank you’ for his help. I know I will do a CT scan in the future and I will definitely go to this facility.

Also the scheduler Teresa Nguyen was extremely helpful. She explained clearly what I needed, the prep, the parking validation,etc. She was so calm even as I was hyper and antsy to get my scan done before going out of town. She found the closest  facility for my scans and my desire date and time . It was the  first time that I had the same day appointment for a bone scan . She did a super job.</Review><Response>None</Response>< rating>

We took my 88 year old mother to have a CT scan.
It's been a horrible experience ever since.
Whoever handles the insurance and billing issues, is a heartless, dishonest, lying, motherless fraud.
What makes a company or business good or bad? People.
This establishment has some really bad apples.
They lie, their fraudulent, dishonest, predatory practice of squeezing
their defenseless costumers out of their limited resources is disgusting.
Shame on you!<//Review>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Review>I was there trying to do a CT scan. There was a misunderstanding which wasn’t the fault of this facility nor anybody in the company(Radnet) so I couldn’t do the scan.  I didn’t have the necessary medication to prevent an allergic reaction. Brandon tried so hard to help me out. He was sympathetic, kind and acted professionally. I really appreciate what he and his staff did for me. I couldn’t say enough ‘thank you’ for his help. I know I will do a CT scan in the future and I will definitely go to this facility.

Also the scheduler Teresa Nguyen was extremely helpful. She explained clearly what I needed, the prep, the parking validation,etc. She was so calm even as I was hyper and antsy to get my scan done before going out of town. She found the closest  facility for my scans and my desire date and time . It was the  first time that I had the same day appointment for a bone scan . She did a super job.< /Review>< Pics>

<Text>I took my 94 year old mother for biopsy of a nodule on the thyroid.  The doctor was "wonderful", but the male technician assisting her and preparing the patient for the biopsy was HORRIBLE. He started out by asking my mother and I why in the world would any doctor send a 94 year old woman for a biopsy. What were they planning to do if she has cancer, perform surgery, not going to happen.  AND he asked the same questions several times until I stopped him and told him I did not want to discuss this in front of the patient.  However, he proceeded to ask the same question during the biopsy procedure with my mother hearing all of this, making comments that a 94  year old woman with thyroid cancer would not be treated anyway, so this biopsy would really just be a waste.  HOW INSENSITIVE!!!!!  My mother was very upset.</Text><date>1542218346553< /date>< pics>

Dr. Chin at RadNet Encino is amazing. He talks to you and puts you at ease. His assistant Hezal (said Hazel) is a sweetheart. I have had problems with uterine testing being very painful and Dr. Chin is a rockstar. He is gentle and always makes sure you are not in pain.<//Text>

I would have given a 5 star but there was ONE question on my paperwk i had to fill in when i arrived that completely soured me to this place. I do not know why i got the question , as 3 other ppl in same wtg room did NOT.... but it asked " are you Hispanic?"  y or N were my choices.   It did not ask me if i was White, African Amer, Jewish , of Asian decent, Chinese, Japanese, Catholic, etc.... ONLY if i was " Hispanic" .... i was offended, DISGUSTED, and only felt like we were bk in NATZI occupation where you HAD to disclose if you were " JUDEN/JEWISH" . Why was that question even there? While i am NOT Hispanic.... i cant even try to understand how that question might make anyone feel. Does it mean if they marked " Yes" they would be treated worse than Me? It made me very sad and uncomfortable. Everyone there is wonderful, this was my 4th time there, and they WOULD have received 5 stars had this extremely provocative,  racist in nature, question NOT been included on their regular paperwk! WRONG WRONG WRONG ....new visit today 8/16/19.justtook it to 1 star. Most unprofessional and horrible MRI  experience i have EVER had. Appt time 12:30... theresa called to say i “ would need to come an hourblater because they werebehind” of course i did because i cant reschedule. Got there waited an addtl hr and Patricia the tech tells me she cant take me if my stimulator implant doesnt show full charge. I had NEVER heard that in apprx 10
Previous mris. I challenged her knowledge about my specific device but she refused to take me. Front office said they had no other times for today even if ingot it to full charge. I then called the manufacturer of my device and she agreed with me....patricia the Tech was wrong. Asked theresa to please let patricia speak directly to the lady on phone but dhe refused and said “ partricia with a.NEW patient now and i would have to wait another 45 min. I took down all the numbers for all of the owners, ops mgr etc and the Director, went home, called him and within 90 more minutes at my request called theresa at the location i originally had a 12:30 apptfor, and drove all the way back where patricia took me.NO APOLOGY whatsoever from her. The frt office staff treated me terribly and i deserved an apology. Im glad my MRI is over. 3rd one at Radnet. Will not EVER use RADnet again. Too many choices for me to ever be treated that way again!</Text>

<Text>I was recommended to meet Dr chin for a Hysterosalpingography because when because when  he does it and you feel no pain and I’m glad I did because I really felt nothing !!! and to be honest I was little scared ..

Melisa one of nurses was super nice from the moment she welcomed us :)
Very professional informative and helped keeping me calmed

Dr chin is super funny gentle and professional
We spoke through the whole procedure which helped kind of not thinking about what he is doing down there

There are many more things to say only good things they were both amazing in every way

I would highly recomand San Fernando Valley Interventional Radiology and Imaging Center for any of the services you may need

Thank you so much !!!!!< /Text><response>None<//response>< gmapID>

Although it is a very busy office, every time I have to have an MRI or anything radiological, the staff is incredibly accommodating and caring. They do their very best in a stressful environment to get your paperwork done, you processed and your tests done as quickly and efficiently as possible.</review>

I would give it Cero stars if it wasn't for the nice front desk clerk's and very nice asistent Ashley. I really didn't like the Dr. Susie mur she wasn't nice .she was very cold Everytime I asked her  Something. I ended up asking Ashley instead because she really knows how to treat a patient. I also asked Susie not to put the instrument on my chest because I was starting to have panic attacks and she said "I have to put them there otherwise I can't do the procedure" but in a cold tone of voice and what I needed was someone with a nicer tone . Luckily Ashley stepped in and made it all better. 5👍for you.<//text>

We had a horrible experience with this place.  After we waited around 3 hours to be seen the machine broke (out of their control I get that) but then they sent us to another facility of theirs.  Spent another 90 minutes at that facility only to be turned away because they decided the second facility treats their clients different than the first facility.  All could have been avoided or at least we could have been given a heads up if anyone would have simply read the paperwork.   But no, instead it took almost 6 hours to just be sent packing.  They will not be receiving any business from me, and I recommend anyone reading this to consider somewhere else.  I will also be telling the referring doctor (whom I like a lot) that he should no longer refer patients to a facility that will ruin his reputation.<//review>
