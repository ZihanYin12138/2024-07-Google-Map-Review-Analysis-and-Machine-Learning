< Review>
I wasn't expecting this fantastic barbershop to be so fantastic. My hair now seems to be quite good! I am fully pleased with their employees' assistance. They answered all of my questions and presented me with a clear price for the services I had requested. I'm sure I'll inform all of my colleagues about them.<//Review>

I have been searching for my go-to place for over a year now. I’ve tried several places but I’ve  had no luck. I’ve finally found the place where I plan to be a regular at! Gabriel took his time to discuss the look and explain what he did once he was done. Super detailed-oriented person, highly recommend him!</review>

My barber left town so tried these guys out. Really nice guys, great space, average haircut. A bit overpriced.< /review>

Awesome experience!!!
Usually I don't really like to do haircuts. Because it comes up not how I wanted, but this time it was different. Barber Olga did an amazing job. She had listened to what I asked for and did exactly how I like it.
Great service. It was fast and accurate.
Definitely will be doing my hair over there.

If you’re looking for a great barber, look no further, Kirill is very detail oriented and is a true professional, I’m very excited to go back for next time!</text>< pictures>

Everyone in barbershop is focused on chair of Olga(she is beautiful and professional), she is little beast that will cut a grass on your head. Have been in 25-30 barbershops all around LA; i am very happy that found this place with my barber for ever.  Don’t hesitate to ask Olga to give you suggestions about your hair style. See you soon guys🙂<//review>

<Text>This place is my new go-to! It's a bit on the pricier side but it's worth every penny. Great atmosphere, music, and interior decor. The theme is on point! Hell, they've even got beer 😂👌 The hours are second to none. If you need an emergency cut I'll bet you this is one of the few places that'll have you covered. The cuts? Amazing🔥🔥🔥 Kirill is the man!</Text><user>112090531044466106700</user><user_name>O B<//user_name><Resp>None< /Resp>< Gmap_id>

Classic barber shop vibe and I got a great haircut. I actually can’t remember the last time I didn’t feel the need to grab scissors and fix something as soon as I got home. This is my new go-to barber shop. Best experience I’ve had on the west side.< /Text>

Just got a haircut from Kirill and he did a really great job. It was my first time here and I normally get a classic sidepart. I showed him some pictures of how I normally get it, and I'm really happy with how it turned out. I'll definitely be back again. Make an appointment with Kirill if you go here.< /review>

<Text>Decent haircut, not sure if it's worth $49. The barber had me face away from the mirror the entire time, so I could only see the end product. Not sure why any barber would do that.

The place is pretty cool, though.</Text>< Response>

I had a great experience at Manly & Sons. I booked an appointment right through Google maps and it matched me up with Charly. I've been trying to grow my hair out and Charly did a good job of educating me on how to style my hair each morning for the length I was currently at. I was impressed with both the business and Charly himself. Highly recommend.< /Review>

Went to Manly and Sons on a Saturday and got a haircut from Caitlin. She's the coolest, friendliest hairstylist I've ever met. She listened to what I wanted and gave me exactly that. I've been to other hairstylist before at other locations and for some reason they all try to out their own special spin on what I ask. Not Caitlin, she's freakin killed it! I've been to a lot of places in LA and I won't go anywhere else now. The place itself has a really interesting atmosphere, plus free water or beer while you wait.<//Text>

Angel is the man. I have hair inbetween curly and wavy(not easy to cut correctly) & I am not often this impressed with a barber's skill. Angel did a great cut, and the shops atmosphere is a relaxed place with cold drinks. I can't recommend this place enough, one of the best in the area for sure.<//review>

I got a shave and the guy didn’t want to clean up the back of my neck or sideburns. When I asked him to cleanup the sideburns instead of making them a straight line he told me that’s not included in the shave and ignored my request? Not cool.</Text>

Haircuts are always perfectly dialed in and the atmosphere is always comfortable and fun. Plus, free beer or a shot!</Text>

I got a haircut here and they were rough, cursed, and didn't match the top and the sides together. I still feel bad about it. I have people asking if I am in the military.< /Text>

<text>Excellent service! Jesse took real good care of my Camry when my power steering wasn't working. He worked quickly and I could hear and feel the difference when I drove away. He even took the time to explain the process to me and show me the parts he replaced. And the price was very reasonable for the great quality of work that he did. I chose him because of the great reviews and he lived up to my expectations.</text></record></dataset><record>

Jessie the owner is amazing. We broke down several miles from his shop shortly before he closed on a Saturday and we were almost 300 miles from home, he came to our rescue, worked more than 2 hrs after he closed. He had to go too a few different part  shops before he found the parts we needed. Honest, hard working and goes above and beyond.  Thank you sooo much. Definitely recommend this shop.</Review>

I recently took my truck in because it would turn off on us everytime we would come to a stop. He said he would charge us $95 just to diagnose, all he did was tell me the check engine light codes. I could have had that done for free somewhere else. He explained the check engine light codes and what needed to be fixed. So we agreed, he charged us about $600 for the first fix. As I am driving the next day my truck turns off on me again and the check engine light is back on. So I call Jesse and let him know, he told me to take it in so he can take a look again. Second time he inspects it he says the part he fixed is working fine and he has no idea what could be causing the truck to turn off. The check engine light was reading the same code he had supposedly fixed the first time. He checked to see if anything else was leaking and could not see anything. As he was showing my husband that there was no leaks my husband pointed out to him the leak was coming from the fuel area. What kind of mechanic let's that slip? A customer telling him how to do his job. So he says the fuel pump need to be replaced, so then we agree to get it replaced. There goes $800 for the fuel pump. He then calls us later on that day saying the fuel tank is leaking and needs to be replaced. So again we agree to get the fuel tank replaced, there goes another $1300 for the fuel tank. You were suppose to tell me the problems it had the first time I took it to you Jesse, not after you fix the only thing you said was wrong with it. So our original quote of $600 turned into almost $3000 by the time he was done with the repairs. Not only that but after paying him so much my truck still turns off, and he can not deny this because he backed the truck up out of his shop and it turned off on him. After all this trouble he could not tell me why my truck was turning off. I took it in wanting to get that problem fixed, instead I feel like I'm back at zero with the problem. I also reached out to him because there was some stuff missing from my glove compartment. He wrote back saying he put my owner's manual back in the glove compartment, and yes it's in there but as soon as I asked him about the missing items he never replied. Sorry for the long review, but just stay away from this man. He takes advantage of people willing to pay good money to get their cars fixed. And yes I have receipts to prove it!

Update: Thank you for your response Jesse, but I still have not heard where my missing items have gone?</Text>

Scam! Do not take your car here! I took mine in and he told me it needed $900 some odd dollars worth of work but I had to give him $600 up front. I have NEVER heard of any shop doing this! I paid him for his time and I got my car back, took it somewhere else and there was nothing wrong! I was just low on oil. The second shop didnt even charge me because there was litteraly nothing wrong. I still gave them money though. This place is a scam.
I also got a print out of what he said the parts cost and he was over charging.
**edit**
My poor granny your  referring too was LOANING me $300 because I only had $600. Everybody needs help once in awhile so that's irrelevant. My car didnt need any major work. And you told me I had to give you $600 before my grandmother was ever mentioned.  I have never had a shop ask me for that much money at front and my grandma wanted to talk to him about it because she thought it was a scam. And obviously it was because I took it to a reputable shop who told me everything he said was false. He said the oil and it was old and it needed an oil change little did he know I just came from getting an oil change. This guy does not know how to run a business. Im glad I took it elsewhere rather than paying him to "fix" my car that wasnt even broken. I have two jobs in one of them is a delivery driver. I missed out on a week's worth of work because he lied and told me my car needed work and it wasn't true. I took it in because I ran out of oil and I wanted to make sure I didn't cause any damage.< /Text>

<review>The guy was very helpful and arrived exactly when he said he would. Only 30 min after I contacted him. I had a flat tire and a full size spare in the trunk but no jack or bar to switch them out and I was stranded at a motel6 and it was after dark. I only had $40 and he initially told me they charged $80 I think, might've been $90... when I said I couldn't do that he asked me what I COULD do, so I could still be helped. He took it and was very polite. I'd recommend this business to anyone in need of mobile tire repair.< /review>< Gmap_id>

Jesse and his team are very professional and got the job done perfectly on my VW CC 2012 in the exact time he stated. I thought no one in Bakersfield could fix my car except the dealers but Jesse and his team proved me wrong. Such a huge relief! I completely recommend them for car repairs!</Review>

If you’re reading this because your car broke down passing through the Bakersfield area and you’re trying to find an honest mechanic that won’t take advantage of you like I was, congratulations you’ve found them!!!
Jesse took good care of me and my ford expedition with a bad alternator, he was very transparent with the diagnosis and my options which built trust very quickly. I checked with my brother-in-law (who is a mechanic) about his pricing for parts and labor and he confirmed it was more than reasonable. Thanks again Jesse wish you and your business much success. 👍🙏<//Review>

Very professional, honest, friendly courteous very knowledgeable I will use him again and again and again it’s hard to find reliable honest mechanics and Jessie is everything I could ask for.

@@@I hired Jesse to do a pre-purchase on site on a truck for me Jesse went through that truck with a fine tooth comb and discovering many many issues he was professional and precise took his time and went through everything with me.
The people that owned that truck didn’t like that Jesse knew what he was doing because I see that they gave Jesse a very bad review they had no right to do so its complete LIES & dishonest straight out slander.
Bakersfield mobile auto repair gets 5 starts thank you for you Honesty I will be using you as my mechanic from now on. Thank you again from saving me from getting into a complete disaster< /text>

<Review>So my tags were due and I had to get a smog to renew them. I went to a smog shop they failed me and when he explained why he said “I couldn’t really administer the test because it’s an automatic fail due to blue smoke” so I brought my car to Jesse and he did two different diagnostic test and my truck came back clear, he even went under the hood and checked it himself! The truck is older it’s a 1999 Ford F 150 it belonged to my now deceased father but he kept it in good condition. My point is Jesse told me the truth, did a thorough investigation to find a problem and there wasn’t one. I recommend him 10/10 he’s honest, price is always affordable and he works with your budget and schedule. I can’t make this stuff up he even gave me a discount because of the $60 I had already spent on a bad test. I don’t write reviews but I appreciate his honesty and the lengths he took to help me. I took my truck to get smogged the next day and it passed, why? Cause nothing was wrong with it!</Review>< user>

Called for a quote because his website says he charges less than local competition (has horrible grammar and misspelled his email), and was told he would charge me $95.00 to come to my location (4 miles away) and then $70.00 just to look at my car. So I'm already down $165.00 before anything is fixed on my car. Not worth the price. A tow and a reasonable mechanic will charge less than his $70.00 "looking fee."

Update: One day later, and the owner of this shop is messaging me nonstop on Google begging me to change/remove my review. When I said I wouldn't remove my review because it's an honest review, he responded very unprofessionally. He keeps suggesting that I am looking for free service, but I'm simply looking for cheaper/more reasonable service. I ended up just towing my car to a neighboring shop and having my work done for a combined cost less than $165 that he was charging just to look at my car without promise of repair.

I had to block the owner of this business because he was contacting me too much on Google. It's borderline harassment. His business is obviously running poorly if he has the time, energy, and willingness to harass potential customers that leave a bad review. VERY UNPROFESSIONAL.< /Text>

My wife and I were driving through Bakersfield and out truck broke down as we stopped for gas. We had to call a tow truck to take it to a shop, but didn’t know any of the shops in the area since we live 4 hours north.  Found Jesse’s Mobile Auto on Yelp and had the truck towed there at 3:00 and planned to stay the night nearby. Jesse quickly diagnosed the problem (bad sensor), got the part and even worked late to ensure the truck was repaired properly. Jesse is a very good mechanic and honest.  We really  appreciated his sense of urgency to fix our truck so we could get back on the road.  Thank you Jesse!<//Review>

I did the initial review on Yelp but figured people need to know how good Natalie and Jesse are on Google too:
Jesse and Natalie were amazing! Where should I start..firstly I was very lucky to find them on a Friday night when my car completely broke down on a highway..Natalie was very thorough on the procedures and fees when I first dropped my car off, not to mention how personable and sweet she was. For the next few days, Jesse and Natalie kept me updated on the problems they found, and were very patient to explain the functions of the parts I asked about. I appreciate their honesty about the problems they ran into, and I’m glad I followed their advice on how to get the problems solved. They went above and beyond and offered help after I mentioned that other things in my life weren’t going well. I’m truly grateful to meet the family and highly recommend their auto shop to everyone in Bakersfield. Oh most importantly my car was fixed at a very reasonable price!< /review>

Jessie is a great, trustworthy mechanic, the best I have seen. At last, an honest repair shop.
He worked late into the night to get me back on the road!
And a follow up phone call to make sure I made it home.

< Review>
Great mechanic with great professional values.
I came in with several problems with my car like trouble shifting, car overheating and what turned out to be a BAD oil leak. I know almost nothing about cars and any mechanic could have easily taken advantage of me. Jesse, however, did not. Right off the bat he explained to me that he could not install parts that I brought myself (I was going to get a radiator fan from LKQ thinking that caused the overheat) He was more than willing to elaborate about the major risks and mechanic places on their business by installing parts with unverified sourcing which was definitely understandable. In the end I didnt even need the part as his electrical guy found a simple problem with my electrical and fixed that. First plus for Jesse seeing as he could have sold me the part too and I would have been none the wiser.
After a good inspection he came back with the list of problems my car was facing. My father, who is most definitely a car guy and uses Jesse regularly, came along and looked at the items that needed repair and all seemed to check out.
I paid a total of $876 for the diagnosing, multiple parts, labor, repair and an oil change to boot. That may seem like a lot (and feel like a lot when you're low on funds) I also gave the man a mess of a vehicle and basically just said fix this please.
Not only was the car idling, shifting, running so much better when I picked it up, but Jesse worked hard to have it done by the very next day. He had finished not 30 minutes before I came to retrieve it.
All in all he's a good mechanic, takes pride in both the quality of his work and the honesty with which he deals with his customers and I would recommend his services to anyone.</Review>

<Review>We broke down 6 hours away from home. We were lucky enough to have him come out to help. After a roadside diagnosis he towed our boat and truck to his shop. Long story short he stayed up until 4 AM to help us get back on the road. We are so appreciative of his help.< /Review>< pics>

After getting stranded on highway 5 i was calling different shops. Jesses shop at jesse mobile auto repair was the only one open on a Saturday and said given the circumstance he would wait till we arrived with our car being towed. He was able diagnose and fix the car in a timely professional manner mean while keeping us updated the whole time.
Thanks to Jesse we were able to make it home safely.</review>

Sure, I can Tell you why I choose 3 Stars. We paid about 110$ for 20minutes of easy work. The Work was done fine, but neither the customer Service Nor the work justifies the high price. Also its a quite sketchy place. AS we were Just travelling through and necessarily needed that Work done on that day we accepted that price. Still i have made better experiences at Other places, without Feeling to overpay. As the Work was done fast and We came as a drop in and were Served directly i guess you deserve the 4 stars. Eventhough I dont agree on the pricing.< /review>

Jesse is an outstanding, thorough, personable mechanic. I have used Jesse’s mobile service and his shop service, respectively, and he gets the job done in a reasonable time frame. He details the cost of service to the last cent. If he finds more issues with your car while he is repairing the approved service, he calls first and does not perform additional service without consent. That’s good business. After Jesse services our cars, we have peace of mind because he fixes the problem correctly the first time. Go see him and you’ll be happy you did.</text>

Mechanic was very knowledgeable and professional.  Customer service representative was really nice. We had trouble with our car. It was stuck in the middle of nowhere and the mechanic and customer service representative where very helpful. They helped with finding affordable and reliable tow truck drivers. My insurance gave them a run around and the receptionist was so nice about it. They where helpful from begging to end. Unfortunately they couldn't fix my car not because the mechanic didn't know but because my insurance didn't want to cover the cost.</text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Review>My Rv stalled on I5 southbound, Grapevine area ( ECU Light ). I picked this shop because it received positive reviews. I'm glad I did.

Jesse quickly diagnosed the problem ( Failed Fuel pump and filter ) and came up with a plan. Although the OEM part he ordered won't arrive til the next day, Jesse offered to drive this family of four to a nearby hotel and provided us with a car at no charge so we can enjoy what Bakersfield has to offer until the Rv is ready for the road.

Jesse and Natalie, the owners and operators are the Dream Team. They are fair and honest. My family are thankful for the hard work and going the extra mile. I HIGHLY recommend Jesse's Bakersfield Mobile Auto Repair. It's rare nowadays to find good honest working folks, and you Sir is living proof.

Best wishes and Thank You,
Roger & Rose

<time>1556585326031<//time><Text>Jesse and Natalie are outstanding—we would give more than 5 stars if we could! Our 1992 dodge campervan broke down on a Thursday night at 10:30pm. Jesse spent two hours working on it that night, drove us to a great motel, diagnosed all of the issues going on, and tried to get us back on the road in one day. When it wasn’t possible because the van needed non-standard parts, Natalie spent hours tracking down the discontinued sensor and somehow got it rushed from Napa to their shop so the van could get repaired as fast as possible. They did all of this for an incredibly reasonable price. This is an honest, kind, family owned business, with both excellent skills and a willingness to go above and beyond to get the job done. We are so grateful to them!< /Text><rating>5<//rating>< Name>

Jesse is the kindest, most helpful mechanic I've ever encountered. When we broke down in the middle of the night in Buttonwillow, he took us in the next morning without a moment's hesitation to fix the timing belt in our 2005 Subaru Legacy (a notoriously difficult repair!!). He ordered and received QUALITY parts the SAME DAY and completed the repair before closing, ahead of schedule! Regrettably, we had another issue with our car starting that night (not Jesse's fault -- there were deeper issues with the car that we discovered later), and Jesse took us back in that night without a moment's hesitation to run more diagnostic tests and replace the alternator. He is an honest, fair, kind, and knowledgeable mechanic, who charges good prices for quality parts and amazing service. And on the topic of the timing belt --Jesse replaced the part PERFECTLY (again, and I cannot emphasize enough, this is a VERY difficult repair for a Subaru of this kind that usually requires a specialist!!). Had he not, the dealership we followed up with for the other issues would not have been able to identify the source of the problems our vehicle was having.

So if your vehicle is having an issue, go see Jesse! Your car will never be in better hands. :) Thank you, Jesse!</Review>

I ordered my food on the subway website and when I went in to pick up, I gave the lady my name and she said I had no order. So I pulled my
Phone out and showed her two different forms of receipts 1) from the subway app 2) from my bank statement and guess what she did? She said well nope no order for you sorry. She didn’t even offer to help me or offer to serve me she just said she couldn’t help me and walked away!!!< /Text>

Saw a new item ...Sliders. So i got 4 with a different meat. After toasting, the woman (appeared to be a supervisor?) didn't allow me to add the veggies i wanted. I asked for onions on all 4, she refused. She said it wasn't part of the menu. What a freaking joke. This item was badly fixed up. Staff didn't how to fix a slider in the first place. The same woman was verbally giving the staff instructions. And since when does staff dictate what i WANT on my food?....i will never order sliders again. This was a waste of money. Look at the photo. I almost threw them away. But had to eat something before work.</review>

Open till 2am, a boon for those returning back home a bit late and enroute decide to get something good to eat. Courteous staff, neat and well kept. Being on the university road no parking problem. Great experience overall.</Review>

Rude mean ugly dark man won't let me use bathroom.until sandwich is paid for. They have 8 sandwiches to make. Bathroom smells like terrorists and makes me sick finally after I show them subway gift cards . Having bathroom emergency felt very sick now I'm even sicker. Lying dark man said bathroom closed. No it's not you have to have available your open 24 hours.not first time this happens to Chief Stand
in sky. I should own all good parts of America!<//Review>

<review>The Desert Rain Spa was in the vicinity of this fascinating installation of Desert X, one of several imaginative and very creative projects that were installed through the Coachella Valley and other more remote areas of the desert.  The next Desert X will occur in 2021.  I was able to view and experience nine of the installations.   Some of them actually caused me to think outside the box.</review>< time>

<review>We spent one night in this motel. The beds were different heights and sizes, one of them had some hair on the sheets.
Four of the hot tubs were gutted with construction cones all around. Very "rustic" overall, kind of reminds me of a place where you stay when you have no other options. Not the stunning place of all the reviews, maybe they take down bad press? It was worth a $50 fee, but not $109.<//review><UserId.>112862882897018922606< /UserId.>< Resp>

It has jacuzzi, swimming pools, and sauna. However,  we can feel springs under the mattress and feel like it's under construction. Price is fair comparing the same area, so don't expect decent price break.<//text>

< Review>
This is by far the best little secret in Desert Hot Springs California..
I love everything about this spa hotel,the owner of the Desert Rain gave me his personal cell phone number..
Whenever I need a break from life all I gotta do is call or text him an let him know I’m gonna be needing a room an I will Be give the red carpet...
I just wished that they would have the pools and spas open all night like the Desert Hot Springs spa hotel does...
Maybe I possibly gave um the idea...
now they might need to at least try it out...<//Review>

Had to go to hospital because it had a lot of heavy thick mold. Day we moved to Miracle Springs, the owner tried to force himself into the room when my husband was gone trying to get us a last minute booking. Horrible people. I recommend DHS SPA, Miracle and even the Hundai just up palm.< /Text>< Rating>

Very clean, Staff was friendly, Price was great, 5 hot tubs and a pool with a deep end that is heated year round, bathtub in the room was deep and clean, bead was flat and not lumpy.  It was a fantastic value for the money.  If you have Children be mindful someone who can swim will need to be watching them continually on account of the deep end there is  NO Lifeguard.  I loved my experience here I plan to come back.< /review>

One of the strangest places I've ever stayed. Rooms were cleanish, but lacked some basics like a night stand on both sides of the bed. The mattress was as basic as they come, but no bedbugs, which is a plus. Great pool and jacuzzi although they were resurfacing half of the spa area when we were there. Staff were not very helpful. We arrived at 2pm and were told we would need to wait until 3 to check in. Small TV in the room, stained carpet, poor location. Price point was good at $75 a night.< /Text>

The staff were very nice, accommodating. The room itself was fine, but the bed was very hard and difficult to get good sleep.
The pool area was nice and they are currently building four smaller hot tubs which will be nice once finished.<//Text>

Good value and quite friendly staff. Nothing really special, and not convinced about the spa part, last time I visited the pools were closed,  but hopefully that was just temporary,  awaiting something better than before. Overall good value for money and good location.</Review>

<Rate>5< /Rate><text>I give these 3 stars for now cause,  I will be arriving there soon. I have seen many reviews. So far I've only seen one negative review out just the few i had read. Sounds like a great place to stay. I did call once to confirm my reservations. The staff member sound very friendly and answered my questions. Until I get there i will found out for myself. Price is definitely my range.💞 Though I do have a question? Is there any real close by food joints or restaurants? And also is there like any parks close by too?
Just wondering. 🤗

Very nice place to stay. Clean rooms. Lots of privacy. Excellent staff, very nice. Price can't be beat in the entire desert area. Amenities are great. Room we had came with a full size kitchenette.. We stayed for an extended stay and we never were bothered by any noise or  staff unless we requested their assistance. Monir, the manager, went above and  beyond to make sure our stay there was comfortable. Desert Rain must be doing it all righ because they are always sold out of rooms before the weekend. So reserve earlier and in advance. You will be pleasantly surprised at this  gem of the desert.</text>

Located 15 minutes from downtown Palm Springs. Quiet and clean neighborhood. Workers were nice for the most part, but when I asked for extra towels and shampoo, they were a bit reluctant to give me any. They had 4 hottubs in the middle with music playing all night which is nice but the music could get annoying. Nice indoor jacuzzi and saunas to hangout in. Clean large, heated pool to swim and have fun in. Technically, they have a gym but it is a joke of a gym with nothing to really get a workout in. All amentities close at 11pm. There was daily house keeping. Room was clean and comfortable. WiFi was pretty slow. Overall, great price for what it is!< /Text>

Really enjoy this place, it's our monthly get away! The staff, the people we've met here the surrounding environment (mts), desert skies, of course the hot tubs and even Rocky's pizza nearby so good! Affordable, relaxing, and hospitable/friendly staff. Check out the sauna too! Something in the works for Coachella season per GM. Just fyi< /Review>

<review>WARNING! FRAUDULENT CHARGES!!!!!!  I have been charged by this hotel and have never even known what this place is and have never even been to California. I discovered a fraudulent charge and called hotel management. The hotel did nothing to help me and the matter is currently being investigated. Don't stay where criminals have access to your card info. It's bad enough that I never stayed there and they still obtained it.</review></record>

<Text>We were informed that the rooms have plumbing issues right before we reached the hotel and we were suggested to find a new hotel by the receptionist. But as we told them that we had 3 bookings, they told us that the plumbing issues were all fixed. That's just now how you deal with a customer.< /Text><Name>Arjun U Prabhu< /Name>< UserId.>

<Review>All the pools have closed signs on them due to no permits “we have to have those up but you can still swim” - so if anything happens in your faulty pools, we'll be responsible? No thank you.” We went as an entire family with 5 kids (nieces and nephew too)- with the soul purpose to swim over the holiday. Also the owner was rude, we stopped by when we got into town and were told we could check in at 1, we show back up at 1 and the same guy tells us not until 3.  Day pool use is $20 per person per hour (for pools that aren’t even ‘open’). We checked in, looked around and noped out. It’ll be worth it when they have the pools up and legally running but to not let any clients know while booking was pretty crappy. Now they won’t even acknowledge our calls to get it sorted out.

Edit - front desk guy was fantastic and accomadating. We are will to give this place another try once everything is up and properly permitted.

Edit # 2 - says there’s BBQs that you can use - it’s one (1) small round Webber grill with a bunch of Park benches that are lifting and splitting. FYI just Incase you were thinking that might be redeeming.<//Review><Date>1530746295127</Date><UserId.>103497824153055121714<//UserId.><Rating>3< /Rating>< Name>

<text>Horrendous experience! Stay away!  I wish I could leave less than one star.

My wife and I booked to stay here through Priceline. First off, they had us scheduled for the wrong weekend. I received a call at 6pm on a Friday three weeks before we were going to be in California asking why we hadn't checked in yet. After calling them I spoke with their OWNER, and it was by far the worst customer experience I had ever received. The OWNER was YELLING at me, the customer, accusing me of having my dates wrong, however all of my confirmations through Priceline were for the correct date. The owner refused to acknowledge that his system was at fault.

I call up Priceline, double check with them, and they had the correct dates, and they contacted the owner of the hotel to fix my dates. After not hearing back for a couple days, I cancel my order (which I still had 2.5 weeks before I should even be charged for any stay).

Fast forward a few days past our actual stay in California, we notice a charge from Desert Rain Spa Hotel for our stay that:
1. We canceled.
2. We never even set foot on their premise.
3. They had the wrong dates for our stay.
4. They didn't even have authority to charge us (canceled within the $0 booking time frame).
5. The amount they charged was a few dollars MORE than the amount on my CANCELED Priceline receipt of what we would have paid.

After contacting Priceline again and spending over an hour with them on the phone (They were INCREDIBLY helpful, I highly recommend them! The reason it was so long was because the owner of the hotel kept putting the Priceline agent on hold for minutes at a time.) Finally, I get confirmation from Priceline saying the owner has acknowledge a refund and will submit it. Normally it should take 14-15 business days to process. Sweet.

Now, sitting here 18 business days post that confirmation email - still no refund from Desert Rain Spa Hotel. So now I have to deal with the rude, inconsiderate owner of the hotel again, and contact Priceline again.

I RARELY write reviews, but this frustration warranted enough to inform others - Stay away!< /text>< pics>

(Translated by Google) If a little construction site, great hotel. The pool with the water from the hot springs was awesome.

(Translated by Google) Perfect overnight stay for a single night. Affordable, free parking, close to the motorway, gas station and a big plus to start the day taking a dip in the pool.

(Original)
Perfekt övernattningsställe för en enstaka natt. Prisvärt, gratis parkering, nära till motorvägen, bensinstation och ett stort plus att börja dagen med att ta ett dopp i poolen.< /Review>

<Review>(Translated by Google) The thermal pools have very good thermal quality and water temperature. The place needs a lot of maintenance. It is very deteriorated and neglected. The room we touched recently remodeled and with everything new and nice. The window of the washroom and dressing room has a curtain that lets light in and it is very annoying because it gives directly to the bed. It does not let you sleep.

(Original)
Las albercas termales tienen muy buena calidad termal y temperatura del agua. El lugar necesita bastante mantenimiento. Esta muy deteriorado y descuidado. La habitación nos toco recien remodelada y con todo nuevo y agradable. La ventana del area de labavo y vestidor tiene una cortina que deja pasar la luz y es muy molesto porque da directamente sobe la cama. No te deja dormir.<//Review>< pictures>

Solid truck, reliable reservations, good customer service. I rented a 26ft truck and all went well. Only issue was that the truck seemed to lack guts climbing hills.<//text>

<name>Ja'net Raines< /name><Review>As a user of quality reliable truck rentals I found Penske not only has the newest and best maintained Rental Trucks available to the public.  Besides quick help service and the by far options and rates for every renter.  And the Mechanic's are friendly and knowledgeable.
I highly recommend PENSKE to everyone for all your rental needs and moving supplies and dollies blankets etc.< /Review>< userid>

BEYOND UPSET WITH THIS PLACE! Would leave 0 stars if possible. Completely screwed us over thousands of dollars! We were renting one of their trucks to move important large pieces of material, when we arrived to get the RESERVED truck, they said they had none left! Did absolutely nothing at all to help remedy the situation either. Go elsewhere if you would like the business to honor your reservation.</review>

<text>I went to pick up a truck that had been reserved the week before and they didn't even have it there or anywhere near. The closest place that had one was over an hour away. This is the most unhelpful worst Penske dealer I've been to and I work for a commercial moving company and use Penske and Ryder and uhaul all the time.<//text></record>
</dataset><record>
< Text>
Horrible service, I called before hand to let them know I was picking up a truck, that was paid for, upon arrival, they said that the truck was not ready and needed maintenance done, which they said would take only an hour, after an hour I asked for the status, and they said more problems where found, which would take an additional 1 hr and a 1/2, they did this 3 different today, penske is closing now, and I'm just hanging out in the lobby while the mechanics are on lunch break, they don't leave until 10 at night, so I'm just sitting here like an idoit<//Text>

Been taking my vehicles to this shop for a long LONG time. My Mitsubishi,  Mazda, Dodge and Infinity. My cars have always consistently recieved great service at a fair price. I've never driven away thinking "I think I just overpaid for this or that". I've also never had to take any of my vehicles back to the shop due to "this or that". I've also never driven away feeling like "this or that". Says a lot about a Auto Repair Shop!! Everyone there is hard working, friendly, genuine and do a great job. Thank you for taking car of my cars over the years!! 🚗 Go check'em out! 🚘</Review>

<Review>Absolute awesome experience here.  Michael is the absolute best!  He's honest and thorough.  He had my 15 year old 290,000 mile truck in tip top shape and safe for a 1000 mile road trip.  Their prices are beyond reasonable and their work is top notch.  I've already recommended this place to several friends.< /Review>< pics>

I thought
I had a leaking head gasket because I was loosing coolant slowly. After checking my truck out I got the call I was dreading but it was the water pump not a head gasket. Much cheaper! They did a great job replacing the pump. Very refreshing to find honest reliable auto repair! I will definitely use Reliable Auto Repair for all of my vehicles. Thanks!<//Text>

< Review>
I've been a regular customer of Reliable Auto Repair since 2014.  I drive a 1976 Buick Century Wagon and a 2012 Toyota Camry. Both are kept in top running condition by Michael and his staff. Keeping a 44 year old car in good condition can be a challenge but Reliable Auto Repair seems to have no trouble getting parts or diagnosing any issues that come up.  The staff is professional and courteous.  I've never left feeling like I paid too much for the services received. Their prices are reasonable and the quality of their work can not be questioned!</Review>

Me and my family have been bringing our vehicles here for over 20 years. They not only have great prices! Their work is top notch in my opinion! I believe many others can agree this is the right place to get your car worked on!<//Review>

I've been brining my vehicles to this shop for about ten years.  The level of service is bar none, let alone the work.  It's difficult to find a mechanic/mechanics you can truly trust and this is exactly why I continue to come to Reliable Auto Repair.  Michael explains and recommends exactly what's needed.  I highly recommend people to bring their vehicles here for said reason and because you will be supporting a local business.< /text>

< Review>
Brought in our 2004 camry which was long due for some repairs. Michael gave a detailed breakdown of the items that were in need of repair and answered my questions about them.

I had AAA do a diagnostic on the car a year back but waited to do the repairs due to the cost and this car not being heavily used much until now. Michael's assessment of the car was pretty much the same, but his quote for most of the repair items was lower.

He waited for my directions on which ones to fix and got the job done in a timely manner. I'll be doing heavy repairs like this with Reliable Auto again in the future.<//Review>

You'll like dealing with Michael, but simply listen to their customers as they come in to drop off or pick up their car.  You'll understand why I only use this business for my automotive repair and advice.< /text>

Michael is an excellent communicator, extremely knowledgable, and has a good sense of humor -- even at 7am on a Monday.  Their estimates are accurate and reasonable,  outlining what repairs are important or a safety issue, and what can be deferred. I've brought 2 vehicles to him for a variety of service items as well as diagnosing &repairing. His team did the work on both very well -- and got everything right the first time.  Reliable is our family's go-to mechanic now.</text>

By far the best automotive shop I've ever been to. Mike runs the shop and is HONEST, respectful, and well educated. He has been present at the shop EVERY time I've walked in for the last 10 years.

He frequently gives me options on how I'd like to proceed with repairs, often times patching me up and sending me on my way for little to FREE. After this many years of business together, I consider Mike the ultimate professional and a good friend. I haven't trusted my car with anyone else in a decade. You shouldn't either.

If you want the highest quality work for the lowest price, you won't find it anywhere else.

Love you guys! Never leave!!!</review>

<Text>Another shop trying to take advantage of the vulnerable. contracting a $100 to diagnose to ensure they have you on the hook for repairs regardless of the cost. The OWNER of the shop of which I spoke to was unwilling to give me his information after he refused me service because I was asking him questions about his costs.</Text>< Pics>

<review>If you’re a woman in need of an oil change or repairs,   please run far, far away from this place. After getting a normal fully synthetic oil change, randomly being quoted $3,000 in “needed repairs” I declined multiple times, and when I received my vehicle they may have broken my newly purchased car on purpose as the same day of service it mysteriously had a $600 part problem in the clutch mechanism rendering it impossible to drive and dangerously broken as I was on a street heading home.

When I had it taken in to a reputable mechanic who works at a Shell, he let me know in his 37 years of being a mechanic he had NEVER seen the stick shift clutch mechanism piece split perfectly in half like that.........

When I got itemized car repair quotes from 3 different mechanics in San Jose, Milpitas, and San Mateo after the stick shift piece repair, I noticed a massive difference in pricing ($350, $570, $227) compared to Reliable Auto Repair’s $3,000 recommendations.

I absolutely hate places that target certain customers and prey on them for money. If you possibly can please have a man go in for you for any future oil changes and avoid the discriminatory hassle. And don’t go here. Please. They’re a giant lawsuit waiting to happen.<//review>< Name>

Great place. I take all of my company and personal vehicles here. They're honest and tell you what's needed and if they can handle the job. They don't waste your time. I've been to many other mechanics that just blew smoke and when it came time to pay it was a lot more than the quote. I'll keep coming back.<//Text>

I chose Reliable Auto because of the great reviews and am glad that I did! My AC  in my Honda stopped working on Wednesday, I called Michael on Thursday morning,  took it to the shop on Thursday afternoon and it was repaired by 1pm on Friday! I needed it fixed before Saturday morning to drive an hour north for work and he made it happen! Because the AC compressor/clutch was not working,  I was scared to drive it and cause more damage.Thank you Michael! It works great now!</Review>

First time customer - soon to be long time customer. Michael was courteous, friendly, and knowledgable. Gave me a quote within an hour after doing a full look-over of my truck - and did the repairs in a few hours. Got a plan for further repairs at lower cost than I had anticipated. Super!<//text>

To whom it may concern , everyone knows how hard it is to find a good , honest and reliable mechanic ( no pun intended) , while look no further . Michael J. is the general manager of Reliable Auto Repair and is the place to take your vehicle for all your auto repair needs . He really stands behind his work . He's both professional , honest , and above all reasonable . So if you do one thing this year , save yourself some time , money and above all peace of mind , take your business to rReliable Auto Auto Repair  for all of your automotive needs.<//review>

The good: their fluid exchange package is low-priced. 3 fluid exchange for $99.
The bad: My A/C does not work. It would not hold the coolant for more than a day. Inspection was free. At first their technician told me I had a blown compressor. I brought in a compressor from a junk-yard. One day after the comressor is replaced, the AC will not start. This time it was the high side valve. Had it replace and recharged. It lasted two days. Then I was told that the monifold has a (old) hole, and the price tag is $500. At that moment I stopped.
how good is their service? You tell me.<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmapID>

<Review>I love this office and the care that is given to my girls. I feel like I am visiting a part of family when I enter the office. Debi and Natasha are the sweetest and very welcoming, no matter the circumstance of my visit. Dr. Phan and Dr. Hagar are the best doctors with the best bed side manner and knowledge of both my dog and cat. I cannot rave enough about this office and I have been coming here for 10 years!! I don’t live close to this office- but I do travel to see them because they are the best!! I wish I could give 100 stars!!<//Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

<Review>We recently moved to Orinda and had not found a new vet for our three cats. We called Mt Diablo for an emergency paw situation with our one year old kitty and they took us in right away/same day with a drop off before 9am. This was truly a life saver. We are now moving our three cats to Mt Diablo Vet Medical Center as regular patients. Excellent service, communication, and attention to detail. Our kitty is now back home feeling better! Thank you!<//Review>< Pictures>

Love this place! From the moment you call or walk in the door, you are greeted with a smile and a caring tone.  Only after a couple of visits did they remember our dogs' names.  Excellent communication and care for our beloved pets. I highly recommend!< /text>

I appreciate the details of everything the doctor told me about my pets. They are on the expensive side and they don't take Care Credit which I don't understand why. Most every other vet I visited accepts Care Credit.<//Review>

Caring and friendly staff.  They take the time to discuss the best options for your pet.  Reasonably priced and open on Saturdays.</text>

<text>I have been taking my dog to see Dr Fan since I adopted him 4 years ago. She is awesome! The veterinarians and staff at Mt Diablo Vet are professional, friendly, and sympathetic. I recently moved from Lafayette but still make the drive to take my dog to Mt Diablo Vet. I highly recommend them if you live in the area and are looking for a great team of veterinarians.</text>< Pictures>

<Text>This is a wonderful veterinary clinic. They are personal and you can tell that they all really care about your pet. I have been going to this clinic for the last five years and love it. I have been to other veterinary clinics before with my pets and the experience wasn't the same. I recommend them to anyone who wants quality care for their pets with people who care about your pets!<//Text>< gmap_id>

I have been a client of Mt. Diablo Veterinary Medical Center for over 15 years.  I keep going back because the quality of care and the expertise and kindness of the staff are outstanding. They have been there for my pets through the worst and my dogs still like going there! My cat is almost 19 and still happy.  I attribute that to the excellent care Dr. Hagler has given all my pets over the years. Highly recommend!</text>

Mt. Diablo Veterinary Medical Center is a great place to bring my animals I would never go anywhere else. The people there are compassionate, hard working, and love what they do. Debbie, the receptionist, always greats me with a smile and makes me feel comfortable leaving my beloved animals in their care. Kim, the lead technician, has such a big heart it is immeasurable. Whenever I bring in my cats or dog she talks to them in a sweet voice and wants to give them a nail trim. Dr. Hagler always spends time explaining exactly what is going on with my pet and I never feel like I am lacking information. I feel like all the people at the Mt. Diablo Veterinary Medical Center take great pride in ensuring the happiness of my pets.< /review>

I highly recommend Mt. Diablo Veterinary Medical Center. We originally went to the Lafayette Animal hospital but did not appreciate the treatment of our pets. We now have five cats and a dog and have been going to Dr. Hagler at the Mt. Diablo Veterinary Medical Center for five plus years.  Dr. Hagler and his staff are amazing. They truly care about the well being of our pets and are always well-read on the latest information to keep our pets happy and healthy.<//text>

I have been a client of Dr Hagler's for over 15 years. He is an incredible veterinarian who focuses on the care of the whole patient. He is extremely thorough in a particular diagnosis of a health condition of an animal. We travel over 100 miles to avail ourselves of his care for our animals. We live in the Sacramento Valley and it is important to us that we have the best care possible for our cats and our dogs. Sometimes as in the case of a dental the patient will not be released until the following day, but we don't consider that a burden to drive a second time. - Bonnie & John A.<//Review>

<rating>5</rating><text>We took our doggie here for surgery and the staff were very kind. It's a shame we don't live closer or this would be my dog's new vet. The service was quick, amazing and the after care was easy. The vet was informative about the procedure and the staff there really love animals. Its easy to spot people who are doing vet work because they have to work and those who are doing it because they are animal lovers and trust me, this place has people who seem to feel blessed to be in a job that excercises their animal loving feelings.

My dog usually gets incredibly nervous with other people but he was very relaxed when the vet picked him up for surgery and also relaxed when he was dropped off. We have to bring him back for a check up and while I occasionally find this to be a chore with his current vet (the only vet in town who seems to have gotten stuck with being a vet), I'm excited to see them again!

TLDR: if you live near the area, your animals will thank you for making them come here for vet work and check-ups.<//text><Gmap_id>0x808562380c4f396d:0x70fbc7fcec025c42<//Gmap_id><Name>Nathan Knight</Name><Resp>None< /Resp>< pics>

Mt. Diablo Veterinary has been our Vet for many years.  In that time, we have brought in everything from rats to cats to dogs and all have received the very best of care from everyone who works there.  Dr. Hagler is extremely knowledgeable when it comes to treating your pet.  We have a "high maintenance" breed that has been the picture of health under Dr. Haglers care.  We've also had to say goodbye to some beloved pets and the empathy and compassion the office has shown our family will never be forgotten.  I would highly recommend Mt. Diablo Veterinary to anyone looking for an exceptional Veterinarian.<//Text>

I was referred to Dr. Hagler by a friend when I moved into the area 5+ years ago.  He is, by far, the best veterinarian that I have ever encountered.  And that's saying something as anyone who knows me, knows I have many animals!
Dr. Hagler takes time with each animal, thoroughly explains any needed procedures, and has provided excellent care for the animal members of my family.  The staff are friendly, helpful, and highly competent.  One of his employees actually adopted a feral kitten that we had captured!
I highly recommend Mt Diablo Veterinary Medical Center for their excellence in veterinary care.<//text>

I have been going to Mt Diablo Veterinary Medical Center for 26 years. I would never take my dog to any other place. Debbie (much more than the receptionist) always greets us with a smile and is very helpful with answering questions and scheduling our appointments. Kim (Piper's best friend even though she cuts her nails), is a vet tech who sure appears to love her job. Dr Hagler, our amazing vet, never rushes us when we have an appointment and really listens. He is an excellent technical vet with the bonus of being a very practical down to earth person with advice that works. The whole staff was there for us when we said goodbye to our 16 year old Border Terrier, and now there for our Miniature Australian Labradoodle.  I have 1000% plus confidence in all of the staff.

<review>Mt. Diablo Veterinary Medical is simply amazing. I trust each and every member of the staff with my "fur-babies" and have never received anything short of absolutely fantastic service. Their medical expertise has helped my cat to overcome his seizures and my dog to overcome an infection that affected her white blood cell count; they have made me feel comfortable, no matter what the issue, with each and every visit. When I think of just how important my pets are to me and the lengths that I will go to make sure that they have the best care possible, I think of Dr. Hagler and Mt. Diablo Veterinary Medical - they are the crème de la crème.<//review>< GmapID>

Local family trying to make it with covid restrictions. Best pizza in the linden area and surrounding. My kids when coming home make this one of their required dinners. Now call them and place your order!<//text>

I love the pizza but they actually close at 8pm.  Not 9pm as what google sAys. This made me upset as I have a family function and wanted pizza plus because it posted 9pm.  They need to update this ASAP To not disappoint anymore customers.  BYW I called T 8:11pm to only heat thru were closed :(<//Text>

<Review>Great place, with great food!  They have a salad bar, arcades, and a soda fountain.  The food is always good, and they have rapid service.  High quality toppings for the pizza, and the crust is absolute perfection.  Never disappointed in visiting this place!  I drive 40 minutes to eat here, and there are several big box pizza companies inbetween, but prefer this spot.  Try them out!</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

Friendly staff! If you are a regular they make the effort to know you by name and treat you as a well loved family member.  Great food at fair prices! Made fresh daily as you wait. Hand made crust with fresh ingredients! My favorite pizza place!< /text>

<review>Christian,  family owned place.  Just moved across the street.  Best pizza IN THE VALLEY! Friendly staff, fresh toppings. Very clean! The bread sticks are unique and truly AMAZING!   Drove 60 miles just to have this pizza again.  Don't have pizza often,  so we do it right!  Well worth the drive!< /review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPP9yLTzF4uHmaSRyMDSm9e80seOliInW4F4m5g=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNfAuR2f1C6MIYElHZOGH0o2r_iFIMUBXVn9MQd=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPP8SMcC_W9KY7k1j_MxQsa_LfDh5p_1RY4SHEG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMfm4350e-3UwLP7Md7B6aoP_tTlTDofO_6JxZn=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP3ZxncSkhSfMXQUZrCmQJl4N9NDnDZbn9WWpRR=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN8t5RjxWoLAOxEAogp9ZVIRxjwAbaPxnndkTTb=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics>< resp>

<Text>Loved their all-meat pizzas! Loved their breadsticks! Love their Hawaiian but add artichokes to it. Right now it's take-out or delivery but I hope they'll have the salad bar someday soon. It's a really family oriented place and their employees are so helpful! Definitely a thumbs up place!!< /Text>< Date>

I totally loved the crust of my pepperoni pizza and we also got cheesy bread which was awesome. We were with a big group and everyone loved everything they got. We were passing through town headed to Yosemite from Arizona and the hotel staff recommended this place for our group. They didn’t disappoint!< /Text>

Corsaros is possibly my favorite place for pizza! It is quite a drive from where we live, but whenever we are in the area, it is always on the top of our list of restaurants to go to. The pizzas are a bit pricey, but this is a family run restaurant that provides great food, so it kind of evens out. If you go, you absolutely have to have the breadsticks!!! I'm not a fan of pepperoni in general, but their vegetarian pizza is top-notch and loaded with delicious veggies. My parents get pepperoni and they say it's very good, too. As far as COVID,  I haven't been inside the restaurant but my parents have. The staff are friendly, wearing masks, and cleaning any surfaces you touch as soon as you're done, and pickup is a breeze. There's a nice area with some benches and beautiful plants as well as string lights on the same street where you can eat if you want to.<//text>

I was extremely pleased with Corsaros. Felt very good with how we and our food service were treated as far as Covid safety.... But more than this... Their vegetarian pizza was probably the best, freshest veggie pizza I've ever had. I wholeheartedly recommend trying this restaurant!< /text>

I was taken here on a work trip by a local Rep and he swore it was the best pizza he'd had...

...and while it may not the absolute best - it's certainly SOME of the best Pizza I've had!

It's thick and the toppings are good and it manages to not be greasy at all.

I still crave this pizza and despite it being a little out of the way - it's worth the trip.

So good!

Awesome staff too!</review>

I Love it when our pizzas are made to order because I have this "picky, picky, picky" way about getting extra, extra cheese and cheese 'all the way' to the edges and Not overbaked!! This place has "Thee BEST Pizza EVERRR..." and 'Thee Best staff!!!!' Thank you to the AWESOME Corsaros Crew!!!
Plus... if by chance something isn't right - which is very, very rare... they will make it right and keep you happy and coming back for more!!!! We Love their bread sticks and sandwiches too! Missing that great salad bar, but that's the pandemics doing waah. Thanks again to all of the staff!!!  🤗🤗< /review>

<Review>Came here with my daughter's softball team, and we enjoyed the food and atmosphere.  Friendly service,  good prices, and great tasting food. I only tried a basic pepperoni pizza and chicken wings, but even that tasted well done and with good flavor. It's big enough to host a team event.</Review>< time>

<text>We ordered the garlic chicken pizza and some cheese bread. Both delicious. I did ask for some plates and they were very nice in accepting. That's when things took a turn. No plates. While not quite there yet, it is this America's dream to own a kitchen full of cutlery and food holding surfaces but until then, the food service industry should treat me and my ilk as who we are. People. People who need plates.< /text>< rating>

Usually enjoy their Pizzas, but not tonight.  I ordered a large combo..there were hardly any toppings.  Usually the toppings are falling off when you pick up a slice...not tonight.  Very disappointed.👎👎👎👎👎</Review>

<Text>Bought a Family size  half Hawaiian and half linguica with bread on the side recently.  Normally a generous toppings on the pizza but this time hardly any toppings and some areas of the pizza was bare and nothing on it. The quality seems to be deteriorating.

<Review>My first time going into this pizza place with my boyfriend and son and I left satisfied ! Pizza and bread sticks were great. Customer service was perfect. It was a busy day but yet, the guy managed to come around and ask if we needed anything which was really nice. It's a place I felt welcomed and i will definitely go again when I come to Kingsburg !<//Review>< Time>

<Text>my family ate at Corsaros for the first time this past weekend.  We had a small Spicy pizza that was really good hot but not over the top, with great flavor.  We had combo that was on point all the way through and a small Garlic combo, absolutely delicious.   As good as the food was the Service was even better.  They were attentive, friendly and incredibly polite.
I can't wait to go back.< /Text>< pics>

<text>First off the pizza is really really good. I get the impression that most of the stuff is made mostly from scratch, or at least of really good quality.

When you have an understanding of unavoidable circumstances, and you show respect while they prepare your meal. They will show you the respect in return (times 2). This place is very professional and worth the wait when it comes to flavorful and handsome looking pizza! Don't miss out! Give them a try!</review>

The food was great, however the service isn't. They should have wait staff to serve the customers sitting in the restaurant. Had to wait over 10 minutes in line just to order. Had to place drink orders for all 7 people in our group as well. Will eat from here again however it will be take out. This is the reason for theb3 out of 5 stars.</text>

Food is great! People are sweet and attentive. Only thing I would list to improve on is to not use as much styrofoam, and to improve the salad bar. Switch out iceburg lettuce for romaine/mixed greens, much healthier. Fun family atmosphere!!</Review>

<review>Love this restaurant. Not only do they have great pizza, and "famous" breadsticks, but there is also a great fresh salad bar, burgers, sandwiches and hot wings. Super friendly staff and a casual atmosphere. You should try it out if you are in the area!<//review>< pictures>

Best pizza anywhere. I went there to drop off my Granddaughter with her other Grandmother  and joined them for pizza. I had never been there which is funny because I live in Kingsburg. I will  recommend this place to every one they get a five star and a triple a rating from me.
BEST PIZZA EVER !!!!!!!
My favorite is the Vegitarian Pizza and they have a great Salad Bar< /text>

<review>Had this pizza ordered by my relative about 6 months ago and then had never chance to taste again. BTW, I forgot how it was but the review was still great. Tried one more time, now thinking to go there often. Really a great taste and combinations. I ordered on the phone and picked up. I hope that in future they can be ordered online. BTW I ordered chicken barbecue pizza with olive and onion.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

The customer service here is usually outstanding. I've been here a couple times where I've had to ask for my own refills on drinks but generally they're on top of it. The pizza is great and the bread sticks are amazing!< /Text>

Best pizza place in town. The garlic sauce is great and the bread sticks are excellent. Check out the Monday night special for a great deal.

Edit: 7-30-19 wanted to add a bit to this review:  I had a very slight problem with our order. It was something that had happened before. I messaged Corsaro's FB page with my concern. They promptly apologized, addressed my issue, and offered me a $20 credit for the next time I would go in. The issue was significantly less than this in terms of dollars. Great friendly folks here.<//Text>

< Review>
The staff was so welcoming and friendly. They made the pizza beautifully and exactly like we ordered. Their breadsticks are to die for, they are delicious and so tasty. I would definitely recomend this place to anyone. Its welcoming and the food is amazing. The employees are very tentative and helpful. I loved my experience there and would definitely return.< /Review>

<review>Best pizza I've had hands down. TO THE STAFF OF CORSAROS WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN ALL MY LIFE?  i wish I would have known if this place a long time ago, I would have drove from both parlier and fresno for this perfect pizza. My delivery wait was about 20 minutes and I had no complaints. Everything was perfect and i highly recommend. Thank you.< /review>< pictures>

Best breadsticks you can get anywhere. Period. Pizza is good and they also have good sandwiches but I still have to say the breadsticks are the reason to go back over and over again. And I do. Also note that they have one of the few good salad bars in town<//Text>

It was our first time so we were a little confused, the girl with the glasses made us feel hurried & she looked annoyed so we just ordered the pizza & breadsticks, other than that the pizza was really good</text>

Their pizza is delicious! Since i am a Clovis High alumni i used to think that BC's pizza in Clovis was the best however now living locally in Kingsburg for five years now, Corsaros has won me over. Their pizza quality is just as good if not better than BC's and their prices are more affordable. Great family atmosphere with a few beers on tap and the pizza always hits the spot!<//review>

I did the event for the Harvest Moon Festival. So of course before coming, i looked at the maps to see whats around. When i saw this pizza place, i had a feeling we would be eating there(daughter LOVES pizza). We ordered the family size 3 topping pizza, 6pc wings, and 4 pc garlic cheese bread. The garlic cheese bread is EVERYTHING i have ever wanted in a cheese brrad/twist/stick. IT IS AMAZING. Hubby liked their wings and thier pizza is wonderful. We live in Fresno, but we will def be back to this place. I LOVE trying local places and i was SOO happy to find out it was as amazing as quite a few people have told me it was.<//review>
