Awesome food!! Very professional and friendly service. Our server Danny made sure everything was perfect! Great job to the guy! If you ever wander to the area and needed a nice place to eat, ask for Danny, and he will take care of you.< /Text>

From the outstanding service to the Hurst burger that ordered another one on a side order, to the NY-style cheesecake that I had to fight over with my friend, this restaurant is very understated. Sweet potato fries were great, chicken fingers were 7 large pieces.

So glad I stopped in here! Nice, although a bit distant, ocean views were a bonus. Worth the stop.</text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><review>Outstanding visit at the resort.  The food from the restaurant was outstanding.  The chicken marsala was unbelievable.  In the top 2 or 3 that I've ever had. The charcuterie plate was my first but definitely worth it. And when we go back I will have it again. 😁😁😁</review>< pics>

We had breakfast this morning before heading off to Hearst Castle. The food was fresh and fast. The service was friendly and very helpful. We had waffles, hashbrowns and a breakfast burrito. Everything was brought out very quickly and was very tasty. Great spot to eat while in San Simeon with beautiful views of the ocean too.< /Text>

They told me that I can use my breakfast vouchers but in the end I could only use one of them for no obvious reason. Overall service is polite though. Eggs benedikt were overcooked.<//review>

This place was a great place to grab a quick bite, also one of the few places that had WiFi / Cell / network connections. It was amazing to unplug and get off the grid, but it was also nice to check my email, and get a soda and a sandwich. I for sure will be back the next time we visit hurst castle.<//Text>

<username>Holly Leas< /username><date>1599277160554</date><Rate>3< /Rate><Text>We ate this evening as a 2 top in the tented outdoor seating area. The only other table at this time was another 2 top. So the restaurant was nearly empty. My husband had the Hurst Burger (Huge, delicious, perfectly cooked), I had the charcuterie plate. I asked our server, Rio, if the charcuterie plate came with crostini's before I ordered. He said yes. The board came with sesame dinner rolls, no crostini’s. I asked Rio where the crostini’s were and he said this bread is what was served with it... so he didn’t think I would know the difference? Nor did he care? We may be just a 2 top in an empty restaurant but the service by Rio was very poor. Being in the service industry, if your asked a direct detailed question about the food, you should not lie. The charcuterie plate itself was terrible- don’t waste your money. The Breakfast staff at this restaurant is exceptional though, and breakfast was very good, with a fantastic serving staff. The only reason I’m giving 3 stars is the breakfast and burger.<//Text>< pics>

<text>This used to be one of my favorite restaurants in the area. I have been visiting here for over 20 years. In the last couple years seems the food is going downhill. We have dined here for breakfast which has always been exceptional. Yesterday our food was served cold for breakfast also we were told they were out of hash browns? Then last night we go for dinner and buy a $28 steak and $19 bolognese bolognese was served cold and the rolls that came with the dinner we're old and stale. All of the above meals have been fully enjoyed prior to this year. I cannot understand what the problem is here. I'm very disappointed as someone who has thoroughly enjoyed my stay at this location and having the convenience of eating at the restaurant. Previously I would have given this restaurant five stars.< /text><pics>None</pics><Response>None</Response>< GmapID>

Nice service. Not much of a view. Quality of food mixed. FRITTO MISTO & CHIPS for $19 was HORRIBLE! I returned it. I got the BBQ for $24, and it was awesome! My wife really, really liked the hamburger, and the salad was okay. The coleslaw was pretty bad.<//Review>

This place only got one star from me because of the staff, the staff was nice and always very helpful. HOWEVER The food was absolutely awful and soda was flat. I honestly couldn’t even eat it’s super convenient to eat if you’re a guest at the hotel but trust me eat somewhere else.</text>

< Review>
I ordered the shrimp and grits to go. I was blown away by the delicious flavors. The shrimp was cooked perfectly--overcooked shrimp is a real pet peeve of mine--and the grits were creamy and cheesy. I didn't know what to expect but this really exceeded anything I might have imagined.< /Review>

<username>Noelle Fawver< /username><Review>Excellent food: I recommend the catch of the day! Large food portions all seasoned well. And Danny was an eager and attentive server. Side note: I loved their denim serving attire with their camel-colored aprons. It somehow worked with the beachy resort ambiance and gave it a trendy vibe. Small ocean view. Would definitely come again if I’m ever in the area again.</Review>< UserId.>

We visited the cavalier twice, both times we had a BLTA sandwich to go and both times we were very happy. Excellent value. Delicious chunky crispy fries, and an extremely good sandwich to eat in our car by the sea. We Couldn’t recommend this place enough.<//text>

<Rating>4<//Rating><text>The Cavalier Restaurant, part of the Cavalier Oceanfront Resort, is located on the north end of the property, where the views of the Pacific are not to be believed. Breakfast through dinner service is available.

The eatery offers a good selection of popular American restaurant foods: pastas, meats, chickens, fish, potatoes, and salads. Several vegan items are available. The chef will attempt to modify recipes to meet your dietary requirements. Many beers and local wines are served. Non alcoholic beer available.

Service is friendly and knowledgeable at this large, busy restaurant. The decor is comfortable.  Warm rolls, delivered to the table, are served with butter. I asked for and received balsamic vinegar and olive oil. Servings are resort large and mildly spiced.

This eatery is a favorite of locals. Several locals in Cambria mention the restaurant.  At dinner time, the restaurant can be quite busy. It's best to make a reservation.

Parking is free and easy. Everything is wheelchair accessible. Morning newspapers, from up and down the coast, are available just outside the restaurant. Since the papers are delivered by truck, sometimes, due to fog or whatever, they're a bit late.< /text>< pics>

<review>I like to hit this restaurant in the morning after shooting photos at the beach in the morning. The breakfast food is good and the hot coffee will warm you up after being in the elements. I've also stopped in for a sandwich after the lunch rush. Skip dinner because the prices skyrocket and the quality of the food is not worth the price. The wait staff is excellent.<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

Tldr; Despite high rating, avoid at all costs.

Long wait, but empty tables. 30$ dollar main course, but 70s furniture. Ocean front, but no ocean views and smells like old grease. Exactly what you would expect from a decaying rut of a place. Unfit to be called a restaurant, more of a cafeteria galore. Nothing more to be expect from a business monopolizing the San Simeon area...

We went across the street to the bar and grill and were super happy. Read the reviews, they are from pensioners who think this hotel/restaurant is a great place to go on a honeymoon...</Text>

Restaurant by the Cavalier hotel. Great view of the beach. Was able to see whales passing by in thr distance. Service was good. Food was okay. Nothing special. Would rather go elsewhere for the price.<//Review>

Summary: Nice and friendly service, good take out container, good location, and bland and tasteless food.

Got a burger with coleslaw. It was just so disappointing bland and without any flavour. Save yourself the disappointment and try to see if something is open down the road in Cambria. I wish I had. I was desperate for a warm meal of any kind after eight hours of travel and I had adequate expectations for the food I could expect in a very small highway stop.

Unfortunately the reality felt way short of that. The burger was cooked well enough but there was just so little flavour to anything, even with added cheese and grilled mushrooms...extra price I paid to ensure some sort of deliciousness. Nope. The coleslaw was quite poor as well. No seasoning. No mayo or vinaigrette to add some taste. Just shredded cabbage.

The positive was that the price was decently reasonable at $14 plus a couple bucks for premium toppings given this was a captive audience in the middle of a couple hotels. However the meal was so poor I felt like I just paid to fill myself instead of getting any enjoyment. At least a fast food burger should give you a few minutes of pleasure for the few bucks.

Also positive was the gentleman helping me place my order. Very nice guy and professional. Service was quick as well and the take out packaging was great.< /review>

We ate breakfast here and felt that the portions were ample. Wanted to try the buckwheat pancakes w boysenberry syrup but was informed they were "all out." Ordered the Belgian waffle w seasonal berries. Strawberries and blackberries were very sweet and large and good. My partner wanted to try the beef from the Hearst Ranch and we asked the waitress if particular items from the menu were made with local Hearst Ranch beef and she answered "I don't know, I'm new to the area." Not the answer we expected -can you go find out? But aside from the food actually being good we were disappointed that there were flies buzzing around and hanging around the windows. Also, our coffee was never refilled and when the waitress remembered we had already gotten the check. It looks like a nice establishment on the outside and all clues point to a semi upscale eatery. We did not stay at the resort. We landed here for breakfast after a walk from the beach just below. Would not eat here again due to the service.< /Text><response>None< /response></record>

Food had no flavor. Scrambled eggs tasted horrible and were burnt. Syrup spilled everything on my plate when they brought it out to me. 1 small napkin per person. Learn from our experience. Go elsewhere.< /Text>

First of all I like to see how much my food will cost to make sure its worth the price, their menu doesn't show prices unless you're adding a side. I ordered the shrimp & chips with a cup of clam chowder soup. The shrimp and chips were great but the clam chowder I believe could've been better. My partner ordered fish and chips and that I highly recommend. Yes I tasted and it was really good!</Review>

This resort hotel offers one of the best views of the Pacific Ocean.  It's pet friendly hotel and has a pool and offers bonfires overlooking the ocean at night.  There is a wonderful ocean breeze that makes you happy to be at the beach until someone ruins it by smoking. Then the entire area is filled with disgusting cigarette smoke instead of sea air. This hotel is 100% smoke free. I think it is so rude to smoke when others are trying to enjoy their surroundings. I mean if you smoke once then stop and forget it, but the guests staying some where near us smoked 3 days in a row, all day. I mean, really. Come on.</review>

<text>We have been going to this restaurant for years. And after an absence due to life, we went back during our a recent visit. It was so good to see Travis and we were immediately seated for lunch. I ordered the clam chowder and Caesar salad with grilled shrimp. My partner ordered a side salad with the Mozzarella sticks. Perfection! Great food and great service. It is the best restaurant in San Simeon and Cambria. Thank you Cavalier!< /text><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmap_id>

Great food and wonderful service.  We stopped in for lunch after visiting Hearst Castle, the staff are fast and friendly, the portions are generous and the menu has a little something for everyone!  If you are in the area check out the elephant seals to the north and Moonstone Beach to the South. 👍🏻🌊.... The view was also great, right on the water.</Text>

<text>This restaurant shares the parking lots with the Cavalier resort.  The food is just good.  Nothing awesome, nothing terrible.  The place gets packed though because it's one of the few places to eat in San Simeon and a lot of the people from the Cavalier resort eat breakfast and dinner there.  They take reservations which I recommend if you don't want to wait.

And most of the time you will wait.. a while.  The service can be slow at times.  One of those places where you have to ask for the check because it's never going to show up otherwise.< /text>< pics>

So delicious for breakfast, lunch, or dinner (or all three!) and very reasonably priced for the ocean views and fine-dining atmosphere as the day wears on.<//Review>

<text>We have been going here for the past 20 years except we were not happy with our last orders . The filet mignon was not too good ,However their Hearst Bacon Burger was good since it came from the Hearst Ranch cattle. However the bun is a bit too small to keep it all together ! Eggs Benedict is also good !< /text><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

Pros: Great food, big portions and nice personnel.

Cons: The restaurant was full and the staff was really stressed. Had to wait 30-40 min for our food and they forgot to give us bread.

To sum up, I would recommend this place but I think it's better to come later in the evening.</review>

Understaffed and overpriced. We were warned to go somewhere else on our way in by customers on their way out. We should have listened. The waitress did the best that she could, but the place was woefully understaffed. Our appetizer was burned, the meat was overcooked and dry, and overall the service was atrocious.< /review>

<Rate>2< /Rate><review>Second time eating here and second time eating the worst meal of a 7 day trip. It's like a wanna be restaurant with stuff on the menu that looks and sounds great but then when you get the meal - it's a "wanna be." For example, the caprese salad - something you'd find at a nice restaurant and it sounds good - we ordered it - dominantly cherry tomatoes cut in half - some of which were VERY old and turning rank, chopped up mozarella cheese and basil that must have been just lettuce cuz no flavor and all with a not very tasty vinagrette - oh and this salad (that had to be choked down) was $14! Won't bore you with all my groups orders. It's like Denny's but food is way worse and prices are three times higher. Gave it 2 stars for convenience off the highway and nice staff.< /review><pics>None<//pics><Response>None<//Response><Gmap_id>0x80ed33bd07fa2629:0x2e600e408eb5c3e1< /Gmap_id></record>

We started with a Shrimp Cocktail which was not chilled but room temperature at best and just warm at worst.  Then the Prime Rib which my wife ordered medium and I ordered medium rare. Both came WELL.  I sent mine back and my wife tried to eat hers as originally delivered.  I got a nice looking piece of meat but neither of the Prime Ribs had any flavor. The veggies didn’t have any flavor either.  The waitress didn’t charge us for my wife’s dinner which was the best thing that happened during our visit.  We will NEVER go back.<//text>< Gmap_id>

A cheap restaurant trying to be fancy. I ordered $26.00 prime rib which had no flavor served with brown water(aju dip) no exaggerating. My husband ordered fish and chip. The fish was mushy. Waitress was nice enough but not worth the lack of quality food.</Text>

<time>1527166178544</time><rating>4< /rating><review>Cavalier is a clean and quiet place in San Simeon with a pretty diverse breakfast menu. I ordered the Ortega Omelette and added ham which was only one dollar more making my meal and whole  $12. I had choice of hash browns or homestyle potatoes and a bread. Service was fast and friendly and the food delicious.
We showed up with a party of 9 on Sunday morning, there were only 4 tables being used when we got there and no more than 6 besides our own when we finished but they would not move tables around to accommodate our larger group. We were split into separated adjoining booths. This made conversation as a group difficult, almost felt like eavesdropping on my own family but it was just breakfast.
I recommend The Cavalier over other breakfast joints in the area because the food is great, people are friendly and the price is well within reason for the area.</review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

Great food, we all liked it, reasonably priced. All the seafood tastes fresh. The pasta tastes fresh-made.
4/5

Wait time
About 30 minutes from seating to entrée, not long for almost every table being filled.
5/5

Service
Wait staff were friendly and funny, and they refilled our drinks quickly. They clearly cared.
5/5

Atmosphere
Almost every table was filled, but it didn't feel crowded. The interior design was well-done and modern. There were huge windows on three of the sides of the dining room for natural lighting, and on side had an ocean view.
5/5

Overall
5/5
You should go here if you're ever in Cambria. We went to another place first (Moonstone Grill), but the the staff there were rude right when we came in, it was too hot inside, and the food was way overpriced.<//text><Name>Jack Albin< /Name>< response>

Much better than the $50 a plate dinner we had the night before. With prices around $20 a meal. Friendly wait staff who were very quick to refill our drinks. Good wine with a view of the beach.< /Text>

Found something in syrup. Asked waitress, wsitress said it was a piece of hashbrown that fell in. Was too hard to be hashbrown honestly. They gave us credit, was appreciated.
It's in a great place. Stayed at the sister hotel. I would stay there again for sure.</review>

It is quaint, great, attentive service, poor wine list. We had the crab cakes and dumplings. Both were very good. A dressing was used with the dumplings that didn't belong. The crab cakes were perfect! 3 of us got the seafood medley and my husband got the chicken parmesan. He said it was good but not great. The seafood medley was very good. It came with prawns, scallops and either salmon or red snapper. It was very good. Dessert and coffee were just ok. It was right across the street from our hotel so it was convenient and decent for having very few choices in San Simeon to eat.</Review>< Pics>

Service was really nice!
Had steak and fries and pasta. Steak welldone instead of medium, fries so lala not crispy at all, but maybe this is only my taste.
Pasta completly overcooked.< /Review>

<review>First day was great with connie taking great care of us. Second day with Qui? Key? Ignoring us and treating us so badly that we swore off ever coming back after more than 30 years of going there annually.<//review>< username>

Excellent wait staff, very good cattlemen burger with Hearst ranch beef, excellent crab cake app with citrus salad, bruschetta was good but a little bland, fries were over seasoned. Definitely a place we would come back to.</Review>

Very bad service. Our waiter was very rude. Expensive breakfast, not teasty and very small meals.
No value for money.
בכלל, שונאים כאן ישראלים. הרגשה מזעזעת. אל תאכלו כאן !!< /Text>

< Review>
This review is for the restaurant only. We walked in, Hostess was extremely rude. Never made eye contact and appeared mad. She sat us down by throwing the menu on the table next to the door  as if it were a  burden for  her to serve us. We had to walk out before ordering because we felt very uncomfortable.< /Review>

(Translated by Google) Would not eat here again. In terms of taste, all of the 4 things we ordered were barely edible. Accordingly, we have given back a lot and have left the restaurant just short of fat. We were never asked if anything tasted. The ambience was cozy, so 2 stars, instead of 1.

(Original)
Würde hier kein Zweites mal essen gehen. Geschmacklich war alles der 4 Dinge, die wir bestellt haben nur knapp geniessbar. Entsprechend haben wir vieles zurück gegeben und haben das Restaurant nur knapp satt verlassen. Wir wurden aber nie gefragt, ob etwas geschmeckt hat. Vom Ambiente her war es aber gemütlich, daher 2 Sterne, anstatt 1.< /review>

(Translated by Google) The restaurant serves good food for a fair price. We recommend that you wear a jacket or sweater. The air conditioner is very cold. Several customers found this. Nothing is being done about it. Unfortunately, there is no other restaurant around.

(Original)
Het restaurant serveert lekker eten voor een eerlijke prijs. We raden u wel aan om een jasje of sweater te dragen. De airco staat erg koud. Verscheidene klanten vonden dit. Er wordt niets aan gedaan. Spijtig genoeg is er geen ander restaurant in de buurt.</Review>

(Translated by Google) I would give 0points if I could. 15 $ for a, if any, half pizza ... ne absolute impudence even if food in California is rather expensive. A pizza 16 '' is priced for $ 21 and you get half a pizza for $ 15

(Translated by Google) We found it more out of necessity of the trip than because we actually went to it. The place is very peculiar, they have rooms but they are not for tight budgets. They also have a leisure area, with typical games and bonfires to watch the sunset.
The restaurant has a fairly contained menu, a bit of everything, I would recommend the fish and chips, the clowder, and for dessert the carrot cake, although the cheese one was not far behind. They have free wifi, and the toilets were decent. The price per person is between 15 and 20 dollars, there is a children's menu.

(Original)
Lo encontramos más por necesidad del viaje que porque fuéramos realmente a él. El sitio es muy peculiar, tienen habitaciones pero no son para presupuestos ajustados. Además cuentan con una zona de ocio, con juegos típicos y con hogueras para ver atardecer.
El restaurante tiene una carta bastante contenida, un poco de todo, os recomendaría el fish and chips, el clowder, y de postre la tarta de zanahoria, aunque la de queso no se quedaba atrás. Tienen wifi gratis, y los aseos estaban decente. El precio por persona está entre los 15 y 20 dólares, hay menú infantil.<//Review>

We love our tub enclosure  door! The installer was on time, very professional and friendly. He installed our door pretty quickly and answered any questions we had. He also cleaned up after himself. We had the diamond fusion applied which makes cleaning the glass so easy! I use cold water and a squeegee and it looks great when done. Would definitely use H2 again to install our door.<//Text>

<Review>I am so pleased with the new shower door that has the protective coating to eliminate the hard water spots.  Thank you for a wonderful product.  After each shower I rinse it with cold water and towel dry the door per your instructions.  So easy!  I will enjoy my new shower door for years to come knowing it will look as good as the day it was installed.  I couldn't be happier.  So glad I found you.
Thank you. Hamida
Update: Per your request:  Danny's Glass Inc., Yorktown, VA  installed the shower door on 2/19/2021< /Review>< pictures>

< Review>
We recently had our entire bathroom destroyed due to the freeze in Texas back in February.  As we were renovating it, our contractor INSISTED on using the Diamon-Fusion glass as our shower replacement.  He said, "trust me...its worth the extra investment!"  So we trusted...and we are SO GLAD we did!  It is simply beautiful and so easy to take care of!  It's been 5 months and it still looks brand new!!  I highly recommend this product!< /Review>

Only had the doors installed a few weeks ago,  but good so far.  Had the green tint instead of clear which gives a richer look to it.  After wiping down, the doors seem to have a film to it, but after it dries completely, that film disappears. Guess that's a characteristic of the coating?? The lady that lives below me had the same installed AND hers recently shattered in a million pieces.. WOW,   now I have questions......< /text>
<pics>None</pics>< response>
{'time': 1623690723232, 'text': "Hi Ellie! First off, thank you for your business and the 5-star review. The film you are seeing may just be an excess amount of coating the supplier applied to the glass; however, rest assured, it should not be an issue. Sorry to hear about your neighbor's shower glass; however, once again, please rest assured this has nothing to do with our coating being on the glass. Diamon-Fusion is nanometers thin, and does not effect the integrity of the glass."}</response>

The manager of Shower Door Source, Dave, sold us on your product. However, when the doors came in from our order, weeks earlier, the sliding door didn’t have your product on from the source. So Dave said they would apply locally, no problem.
We cannot see that it works at all! The glass still spots badly, every time, whether it’s rinsed or not. If it’s not wiped frequently, every other day, it spots every where. Not happy!< /review>

Very happy with them & finished product .  From the initial meeting when the knowledgeable rep offered great options and gave me pricing.  I was expecting to have to wait a few days for the prices; what a nice surprise.  They delivered within the 2 week time frame he quoted.  Installation was neat, clean & on time.  The new shower doors look great; what a nice improvement over a shower curtain!  Highly recommend them.<//Text>

<text>The coating does protect the glass from water droplets stains. I was surprised that all I had to do was to wipe with a towel or sponge.  Other houses that I owned with a showerr glass coating did not hold up as well.  I guess the technology is finally here to have beautiful shower glass all the time.  Worth the extra cost to have the clear glass with the coating. I highly recommend this product.<//text></record>

We are very excited about our 2 new glass panels, floor to ceiling 10' x 30 "" each. We had them installed on each side of the remodeled shower with a 3' walk thru in the center. The special coating on the glass allows us to squeegee it easily after showering to keep it like new and stain free. Love it< /text>

The company we went through provided us with Diamon Fusion protection and the glass still looks AMAZING! We haven’t cleaned it (shame on us) but there are no streaks yet. I love that I didn’t have to buy special cleaners and I can just wipe it down with a squeegee or soft cloth. I hope it continues to hold up this will because it will definitely cut down on cleaning time and we can see our beautiful marble wall tile.</Review>< Name>

Absolutely love our new DFI shower door enclosure. It's the clearest door I've ever personally seen and the upkeep is so simple. My wife was hesitant to have it installed for fear of keeping it clean, especially with the hard water of Pleasanton. No one was more surprised or pleased than she. We simply wipe off the door with a towel and its done. It sounds cliche, but if there wasn't a handle or hinges in the door, you couldn't tell there was a shower door at all....very pleased with the product and the company.<//review>

We just got our bathroom remodeled and needed a huge shower glass door. The company we went through provided us with Diamon Fusion protection and the glass still looks AMAZING! We haven’t cleaned it (shame on us) but there are no streaks yet. I love that I didn’t have to buy special cleaners and I can just wipe it down with a squeegee or soft cloth. I hope it continues to hold up this will because it will definitely cut down on cleaning time and we can see our beautiful marble wall tile.</Review>

<review>Glass stays super clean with a spray down and the odd squeegee. Once I month I clean it with a puff ball and soap, then spray down and squeegee it and the doors look brand new. This whole process takes me less than 5 minutes...Much quicker than the old fashion way. Great work and product!< /review>< rating>

<Text>I have a two panel "barn door" type of sliding door in my bathroom tub.  I enjoy that one of the panels has a bar where you can hang a towel.  It has been easy to keep the panels clean and I love that I'm able to admire the tile surrounding my tub.  Whenever I'm blow drying my hair and can see the beautiful tile because the clear panels allow that transparency.  It makes my small bathroom seem larger.  I also keep a digital clock in the bathroom and I'm able to keep on schedule because I'm able to clearly see it while I'm in the glass enclosure.  I'm really happy that I chose this type of door.</Text><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

It's beautiful, changes the whole bathroom.. We waited an extra day to use it, just to be on the safe side..  They have a customer for LIFE!!, I'll recommend them any day, any time.

<text>I purchased a semi frameless shower door from Donovan Mirror and Glass in Wisconsin and requested the Diamon-Fusion as suggested.

After a month of use by three people daily, the glass is crystal clear! Not like the glass door my mother had about 35 years ago. Her door was a constant thorn from hardwater marks.

I would fully recommend the coating to anyone!

Thank you for a great product!</text>< Pictures>

No issues.

<pics>None<//pics><Review>I opted for the Diamond Fusion International treatment on my new frameless shower enclosure. The new enclosure has been installed for about a month now and I love how easy it is to squeegee off the water on the glass and there is none to little spotting left on the glass. So far, I highly recommend this treatment to make cleaning your shower doors easier and keeping that 'new look'.<//Review></record>

Had the Diamon-Fusion glass shower doors installed 4 weeks ago and they  still look like new as we follow the recommended rinsing practices.  No soap scum or water spots and they glide open and closed with ease.  These doors are a wonderful upgrade to our remodeled bathroom.<//review>

<text>We had been wanting a glass shower enclosure for a while, and were glad to make contact with local distributer who came out and measured and advised on the different  styles and options offered.  We decided on the Diamon-Fusion model because of its clean modern looks.    The installation team that brought the glass out was professional, perfectionists, and meticulous.  Installation took about an hour, and the team cleaned up everything before leaving... Great choice...

I have had my shower doors and glass for 18 months, and I squeegee them and towel dry after each shower.  They still look like new!  I'm very happy with the Diamon-Fusion product on that glass.  So much so that I also got the Diamon-Fusion coating on the glass for my Master Bathroom shower in July 2020.< /Review>

To be honest at first I thought this was going to be one of those thing that'll be good only for a few day and then I would end up paying for something else just to keep it clean, but I was wrong. I am super glad I went with the DFI treatment cause it really makes a huge difference. After the install and using the shower for 3 weeks I started noticing the glass was starting to haze because of the water droplets and soap residue. So I read what DFI recommended which was really simple, just use a soft cloth and go over the surface in circular motion and then rinse (no cleaner just water). I really couldn't believe it, I really thought this was BS but to my surprise it really worked shower glass looks like new again. The haze, droplets and soap residue all gone. Wow extremely surprised I would definitely recommend this to anyone 110%. I will be using DFI again on future projects. Thanks DFI great investment. Now I help the wife with cleaning the shower 😁<//review>

<review>I squeegee or dry my shower glass after each use to keep it looking like new. It takes a minute and saves me from having to do a deep clean weekly. Our water is some of the “hardest” in the country.

Glass Rescue has worked better than the automotive products I've tried to remove lime scale from our shower doors.  It took me far less effort and time to clean our doors.  Also, I liked the smooth, creamy texture that allowed the product to stay on the glass as moved it around in circular motions...so much better than the clear watery products I've tried that merely dripped down the glass.  I highly recommend Glass Rescue.< /text>

WE have had the shower door for almost a month. It is easily dried with a towel and it is clean as new. We have yet to do a monthly clean and to tell the truth I do not see any real need for it. It is stain and streak free just with the daily cleaning.< /Review>

<Review>My new shower doors are beautiful! However, if you follow the instructions to rinse the doors with cold water, the water actually splurts out underneath onto the floor! So instead we gently squeegy the door then wipe with a microfiber cloth. Also, on install the seal along the door cracked while they were installing. They reordered and came back a couple weeks later and that one cracked as well. I am now waiting for a third seal. In the meantime the seal doesn't look terribly bad but it's an annoyance.</Review>< pics>

My shower doors are definitely easier to clean now vs what it was when I didn’t have DFI coated shower doors. I’m pretty impressed how the water glides off. I’ve had these shower doors for about a couple months now and glad I switched it up. Highly recommend! Coming from someone who lives a very busy and work-filled lifestyle and doesn’t always have time to clean.</text>

<review>Unfortunately at this time I am having leaking problems with this brand new frameless installation. The installer has come back once already and it still needs to be corrected. They tell me all frameless shower doors leak. If they had told me that upfront I never would have purchased them. Let's hope they get it right this time, I'd really like to be able to use my new shower.<//review>< Pictures>

The first time I cleaned the door with Diamon-Fusion a weeks or so after installation, there were water spots near the bottom of the glass.  I used the recommended cleaning method of just water, that did no good to remove the water spots.  I looked over the cleaning guide, it recommended to use  'Sprayway' glass cleaner.  It did not seem to do much good.  I'm not sure what I am going to do, I have not reported this to the dealer at this time.< /text></record></dataset><record>

< review>
I thought it was a great product too, until a month later I noticed spots on the glass. I followed directions as per their video, their followup email to me (that requested this review) and in the warranty card provided at time of installation.
A customer service rep told me (when I wrote about the stains)--that the glass has to be squeegee EACH USE. My other shower door looks great after 5 years and we only squeegee it periodically.
Chose this product based the need for rinsing only: I have a spinal fusion and cannot bend to squeegee.
So this company is selling fake news.< /review>

<review>Finally!  A product that works on glass shower doors!  My home is at the beach and the water leaves spots on my shower doors.  I just used the trial packages of DFI Restoration Powder and DFI Glass Rescue.  Each product totally removed all the water spots from my doors.  They look brand new!  I have not yet applied the Clear Fusion Protective Glass Coating, but I am sure it will be just as effective as the cleaner products are.  Great products!</review>< pictures>

Thank you for this wonderful product.  Our shower door and side panels are a beautiful asset to our new home.  They are always so clean looking regardless of how often they are used.  They upkeep is simple and the results are clean looking glass.  Traynor Glass Co did a great job installing this product and recommending Diamon-Fusion.  Thank you both.<//review>

We got the DFI coating on our new shower door from Original Frameless Shower Doors and we're very happy with the appearance and performance of the coated glass, especially when compared to our old mineral etched ugly shower door.</review>

These are the nicest shower doors I've ever had.  It's easy to keep them clean.  Just wipe down after each use and they look like new.  Great product and worth the price.<//review>

< review>
Getting the DFI coating on our Frameless Shower Doors was definitely money well spent.
I recently got the Cosumer Maintenance Kit because I was having issues with hard water deposits.. I honestly thought my shower doors had been ruined for not maintaining them properly.
I contacted DFI, and they were amazing. They sent me the kit, together with a detailed explanation on how to use it, which was very easy, and my shower doors are looking brand new!!!
I want to thank DFI for their excellent customer service. Dacia was very polite and helped me solve my issue right away.</review>

<review>Diamon-Fusion is a must have product. I cannot imagine living without it, every time I take a shower I thoroughly enjoy looking at my frameless doors which sparkle and shine like actual diamonds! Installation was smooth and simple, any time I see a bathroom I can tell right away if they are in need of Diamon-Fusion and most are! Can't wait to remodel my other bathroom to enjoy the glisten of Diamond Fusion on the doors.</review><gmapID>0x80dce8279dac1ecf:0xbee523676ade339d</gmapID><response>{'time': 1571874002298, 'text': 'Thank you for the great review Narbeh!

The shower glass cleaning solution was the only thing that worked in getting the streaks and water stains off the glass shower enclosure BUT it takes a lot of elbow grease as well.< /text>

Started going here for brewing supplies, but Scott has expanded since. Not his bottle emporium is one of the best (if not the best) in the area. He curates some really good stuff from all over. I also have been enjoying the natural wines they've been bringing in.</Review>

I live in TX now, but make it a point to stop in when I'm in CA. Been homebrewing for over 6 years now and this is by far my favorite shop. Always friendly, always helpful, and always stocked up on supplies and great bottles.
If you're thinking about homebrewing, this is the spot to start. If you're looking for supplies, Scott has them or will get them for you. If you're looking for hard to find, solid beers, he's got the bottle side of the shop going too.
Pic was a recommendation from the shop and it didn't disappoint.
Cheers!</text>

Great brewing classes, staff are friendly and helpful. The guys are all really knowledgeable and none of them have ever been condescending at all, which is rare in any hobby store.

Prices!
Believe it or not, the prices here are a little bit cheaper than Amazon. I don’t know how they do it.

It’s convenient and fairly-priced. Support local businesses like this one! Even if you don’t know how to brew, they’ll teach you. Well, maybe not now. I hope they’ll move their classes online, because we used to really enjoy those!< /review>

This place is great! Everything a homebrewer could want, plus a great craft beer selection. The only problem is everytime I pick up a brewing recipe or equipment, I end up picking up a few beers as well.< /Text>

<Review>This is the best shop for brewing supplies and a great selection of beers to drink. Scott (owner) is one of the nicest guys you'll ever meet. He has curated a fine selection of hard to find beers and is always willing to help you make a solid choice no matter what type of beer you're looking for. I have yet to start brewing my own beer, but when I do, I will definitely reach out to Scott for advice and come to Windsor for my supplies.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None</response>< Gmap_id>

<Review>I've been to quite a few homebrew supply stores in my brewing journey and this is one of my absolute favorite locations. Scott, the owner, is a super chill and knowledgeable guy.  The prices in the store are actually competitive with what you find online (which for any homebrewer actually comes as a bit of a shock!). If you're into brewing or just great beers in general, be sure to stop by and check this place out.<//Review><Resp>None</Resp>< rating>

The shop is tidy, organized and packed to the brim with equipment and ingredients. The customer service is helpful and humble and knowledgeable. In addition to being a great place to purchase brewing supplies, they also have one of the best selections in craft beer in the county. Do yourself a favor and go here.< /Review>

The 5 star reputation is for a reason, folks. Such a wide variety of top of the line beers. Knowledgeable stafff, etc. I don't think you will find a more unique select in or around Costa Mesa. It almost pains me to give this place another 5 starts, because it's probably going to result in me missing out on a true gem in the future, but I'll be damned if they don't deserve it nonetheless!</review>

This place has a great selection and fair prices.  From brewing equipment, to grain variety, to hop selection and yeast, you should find everything you need under one roof.  I find it a lot less expensive and more convenient to take a trip over to Windsor than ordering from online home brew shops.  Even if you prefer the online stores, this is a great place for a last minute item needed on brew day!<//Text>

Home Brewer? Beer snob? Industry personnel with a beer emergency? Scott at Windsor has got you covered.

Whether you're just getting started or a serious home Brewer, Windsor carries all the homebrew supplies you could possibly want. Looking for so thing specific? Talk to Scott. He's quite often happy to oblige.

Beer snob looking to learn more about where your beer comes from? Be sure to check out Windsor's events- you'll find many of southern California's top craft brewers stopping by to chat about their industry.

Or, if you're like me and finding your beer on the go setup kind of lacking (jockey box missing some attachments), or your CO2 tank needs to be filled, let Windsor help you out.

Call ahead if you're on the hunt for something special, you'll know before you go!< /text>

I live in Anaheim and have other options for home brew supplies but I prefer to drive all the way to Costa Mesa because Windsor has everything I need all the time. Scott is also very helpful and knowledgeable with brewing so you can pick his brain.< /text>

Awesome Shop.  Scott keeps the shop spotless.  Based on every other homebrew shop I have ever been in, I'd say keeping a homebrew shop clean is no easy task.  He always goes out of his way to help.  Example.  I was brewing a beer for a comp that used German Pilsner.  He went to the back and opened a new bag of extra fresh malt.  Finally, prices are very reasonable on par or cheaper than many of the online shops.< /Text>

This is a great example of a homebrew shop owned by a homebrewer who cares about the hobby and the craft. He regularly helps supply local microbreweries when they are in a pinch, and is active in the local homebrew community.<//Text>

We've done a fantastic job of accommodating you. It was a fantastic place to relax. The tour was also fantastic and well worth the money. The experience was fantastic. It comes highly recommended!<//text>< pics>

The food was well priced and delicious, but there was nothing that came with it as a side dish as part of the meal unless you pay extra. The service was great. I enjoyed the food, I just wish there was more to the meal--like rice and beans or something</Text>

Went in for the posole. Craving it all day. Was dissapointed. Posole had no flavor and was very bland. Like the chicken had been cooked separately.</text>

<text>The food is always soooo flavorful and delicious! Right off the hot stove! The meals are so fulfilling because it feels like a home cooked meal away from home. I love this place! It’s very homey, and everyone is so kind. I love the fried fish, horchata, and fish soup!! Yummm< /text>< Rate>

<GmapID>0x80dcec33baeb78a9:0x9c00b399bb2c3bfa< /GmapID><review>My hiking shoes are getting a little bit run down and I thought a new pair might be in order before my trip to Joshua Tree this coming weekend. I ended up mixing it up and getting a pair of Nike Wildhorse’s. Super comfortable, great grip on the bottom and I loved the vibrant color pops. Time to break these puppies in< /review></record>

I’ve had the same casual athletic wear for awhile and it was time to renew my wardrobe a bit. I found so much great stuff I loved. I got a couple of Nike ¼ Zips, a Few t-shirts, two polos, a pair of golf shorts, and a pair of joggers. It was not a cheap trip but I loved everything I got and it will completely revitalize my wardrobe!</text>

Dick’s give you the whole selection when it comes to sporting goods. No matter what sport or hobby you’re into, you can almost always find exactly what you’re looking for at Dick’s. Indoor sports, outdoor sports, apparel, workout equipment – They have it all! All of the staff is really helpful too and they do a wonderful job compartmentalizing their specialists to provide top notch customer service.</review>

<Rate>1<//Rate><Text>I purchased two 45 pound weight plates from them online for in store pickup on the 2nd of January — ten days ago. I picked the items up later that day. I naturally assumed that I was charged right then and there, and the transaction was done.

I was wrong. Apparently, the store attendant forgot to mark my item as picked up. And because they forgot, they forgot to charge me — because you are only charged upon pick up. And because of their forgetfulness, I was just randomly charged $200 — two days before next pay period. That’s a major blow to someone financially, to charge them $200 without them being aware of it with only a few days remaining in their pay period. It’s completely to the fault of the store employees who forgot to mark my item as picked up. I tried reaching out to the store and to Dick’s customer service, but they have failed to reach back out to me.< /Text>< pics>

<Review>I find this store excellent in its size, inventory, and service.  In addition to numerous other items over a couple of years, I have purchased several pairs of athletic shoes there, including one pair yesterday, and Jen, who runs their shoe department, is absolutely THE BEST. . . . She is totally knowledgeable about all the shoes, brands, types, best styles and fits for the individual, as well as the good deals and best buys.  And she is tireless and happily willing to bring out as many pairs of shoes in different styles and sizes that it takes, so the customer can try them on to get exactly the best fit, look, and model for their particular needs and likes.  She does all this with a smile and good attitude.  I love the shoes I have bought at Dick's Sporting Goods from Jen.  They fit, feel, and look great!!!  My shopping experience there is wonderful, and it makes spending more money than planned painless.< /Review>< Pics>

Warning!!! Don’t have Dick’s work on your bike!!! They promise a phone call to pick up when complete. They promise a time frame when complete. I finally called Dick’s as the bikes were almost a week overdue with no phone call. When I called to speak to the bike tech, “he no longer works there”. When I spoke to another employee, I was told the bikes were done. I asked what was done, if the check list was complete, they had no idea, no documentation, no notes, the checklist was empty...nothing! They just thought they were ready and finished. I was told, “it looks like the bike was lubed”. The bike chains were black with crud and had dirt in the links. I had to remove the front wheel to load in my SUV, I put the wheel on loose when I dropped off. When picking up, the wheel was still loose...never inspected, the bike was never taken for a test ride. They didn’t bother to adjust, clean or inspect! They have no knowledge on working on bikes. The store is poorly managed. I was told John, the manager would get on the phone and talk to me, I was also told the manager would come talk to me when I picked up the bikes. I never spoke or heard from the manager. This place is a class act! Why can’t I rate this store and the employees with ZERO stars?<//text>

The inventory is low and I suspect that it's going out of business. I had trouble finding items I expected there. I'm not sure I was greeted by the staff, but they seemed under staffed and stressed. I enjoyed it while it was here. I might go again if they have a clear out sale.<//Text>

I made bunch of calls and the estimates that I got where a over the place. When I saw their add I called them and they where exact on the parts, labor and the price. Thank you guys! You are the best! Keep up the good work and I know whoever uses your service will be happy. Make it a beautiful day - God bless and keeps us all save.</Review>< gmap_id>

<text>Great service and fair prices! I came in 15 months ago and got the least expensive rebuild battery for my Prius (because it's a 2004 with almost 250k on it). This set me back just under 1k and came with a 16 month warranty. It worked great but started to act up a little yesterday. I came in with my warranty in hand, a little worried that with only 2 weeks left on it they might try to get out of helping me. Well, i had no need to worry! Mo remembered me, where i worked and detailed of our last conversation over a year ago. He IMMEDIATELY got to work replacing my battery and the process should only take about 30 min! I highly recommend this place! Wish i could give 10 stars!</text><time>1555348259318</time><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMByunjKeKXzhB3NdLfTARHB9zDjpVd8jZydbTL=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics></record>

The owner provided a free diagnostic and told me why my engine lights were on. I checked out their website and it has all the information I needed to know about my car and what battery is the best option for me.  They also provide same day service if you really need your car the same day for no extra charge. Fast and much cheaper than other places I contacted. Would recommend Ace Hybrid Group.< /Review>

<Text>I spoke to the owner of the business asking if they helped install batteries and he said he would do it for free. I was really thankful at first and was going to leave an awesome review. However, after he did the service and replaced one of the fasteners, he charged me $50. I chose not to dispute it because he did a great job installing the battery and did it within ten minutes. After I left the business, I couldn’t help but realize that I felt I had been taken advantage of. I do recommend this business but the owner could have been more reasonable with the pricing and charged me $20-25, not twice that amount for ten minutes of labor and a fastener.<//Text>< Name>

Went in for a diagnostic and my inverter cooling pump was broken. I asked how much it would cost total for the part and labor and they told be $450. I asked how much the part was and they told me $300 for an original part. I told them I would look at other options and they tried to intimidate me to stay and get the work done there. They told me I would destroy my car if I drove it and would damage this and that. I called the dealer for the part which was only $89 dollars including tax. This place is a straight up rip off they take advantage of their customers. I called the next day to see how much labor would cost if I brought in the part but they never answered or returned my calls< /Text>

<review>Moe and his team are outstanding, and offer world-class, same day services that put dealerships to shame.

Backstory: I was driving my 10 year old Prius on the highway when the hybrid battery DIED, cutting my engine on the highway. I cruised to the side, panicked for a moment, then got referred to Ace Hybrid Group from my paint serviceman Erik from ER Painting Services in Santa Ana. I called Moe in a panic, slightly frazzled from my near accident on the highway, but he was calm, kind, and professional in my inquiry.

I got my car towed to Stanton all the way from South County, and it was definitely worth it. I walked in, half-expecting to call my husband to pick me up after the preliminary quote so they could order the battery, BUT BY GOD, THEY HAD MY BATTERY THERE AND INSTALLED IT IN LESS THAN 45-MINUTES!!!!! It was an absolutely MIRACLE!!!! I had called a dealer earlier, and they dismissed my urgency and said they would have to "order a new one" which would take a week or two to come in. And yet, here, Ace Hybrid Group not only has my battery, but installs it IN LESS THAN 45 MINUTES. Take THAT Dealership!!!!

My day literally went from narrowly avoiding an accident, to needing a replacement hybrid battery, to being back driving on the road, heading home, in the span of 5 hours. THAT is world-class service, my friends. Plus I have 7-year warranty from Ace Hybrid Group, and Tim was so friendly and courteous in the front office. This truly was the oasis business in my dark hour of need that I could not have dreamed up better, even if I tried.</review><user_name>Ari Leon< /user_name></record>

Great quality and service! Super knowledgeable and purest customer service satisfaction! 5 star is not enough for it! It’s 6 years that my battery is functioning well ! I changed it on 2012 and today we just bought another car and that needed a battery! We call them and found their new location and just leaving a review because they improved it very well as far as quantity.
Thanks Ace ...</review>

<Review>The shop itself is clean compared to most automotive repair shop. Receiving area and bathroom were very clean .I met the owner and owners son. They were extremely kind and helpful. Explained my problem and repair options for my aging 2008 prius. The price was very reasonable as this is the second shop I went to.  And even gave me a senior discount. Definitely recommend this place.</Review>< Pictures>

<review>My 2003 Honda Civic Hybrid's IMA battery has been dying for the past year. Last week, I finally put together the money to get it repaired. I was never going to go to anyone but Ace, having already done my research. Ace's new location is so much better than their previous Westminster site with a great waiting room/clean bathroom. Mo's attention to detail and knowledge is great. This company has been in business for more than 11 years doing hybrid repairs; why get financially creamed by a dealer when you get better customer service and, most likely a better unit for your car. I am totally pleased and so glad to be able to finally drive this car (rather than tiptoeing around in it); I recommend Ace highly.< /review>< GmapID>

Best quality of customer service! They are A brand! At the first I thought I am going to a normal battery store, but after I walked in and checked their wearhouse it was amazing how they are comparing with Toyota dealer and big brands as far as quality, price and customer service ... it’s almost a year that my Toyota Prius is running awesome with a green light .

Thanks to Ace hybrid group and its staff ...< /text>

Their prices are amazingly fair bacause they have so many customers every day.My Lexus hybrid battery was dead they back it to the lif within only 30 min. This shop was the only shop I found after 3 days searching which had the long term warranty with a very very fair price of only 2000.00$ . I’m really satisfied from the Moe’s service and his friendly team workers.< /text>< Response>

<Review>Good place and good service up until the warranty wears out. We changed our battery from our Prius 2006 in April 2017 with a 18 month warranty. Since then we had to go back twice since their new "remanufactured" battery didn’t last more than 6 months.

The warranty is now over and we had our battery checked by an other hybrid technician since all the dashboard lights turned on...  The diagnostic revealed that 7 cells were bad and the other ones were about to go bad since the pack that was put in our car is an older assembly that we had originally. We are now basically stuck at spending an other 700$ in order to get our Prius in good shape again :(

I wanted to leave a review since when I did my resarch before I was seeing only good feedback about Ace Hybrid Group and I don't believe they are all true.<//Review><userid>118044124893863580820</userid>< gmapID>

< Review>
We've been there 3 times. Each time we ordered some hours before via phone or website. The first time our order got cancelled on a very short notice. The second time they completely forgot to prepare our order. They didn't have enough bagels (at 11am!!!) to prepare it on spot. The third time we finally got the bagels, but when we arrived we were told, that they don't have the açaí bowl.
Moreover the service was not friendly. When entering the door they were shouting that they ran out of bagels. We felt like they just wanted to clean up and call it a day.
The only reason why I gave two stars is because the bagels are actually good!< /Review>

<review>If you want your order to be totally wrong and take more than 30mins to receive, well you have to come to right place :) ! I told myself I wasn’t coming back but I was given a card FREE BAGEL for the inconvenience.  Big mistake again, the experience was terrible so I won’t be returning.  Which sucks because I like their bagels but not worth me leaving mad.</review>< pics>

<Text>Nice bagel cafe in La Mirada. The Signature 421 coffee is amazing and they have free samples. The Bagels are fresh, but you better come early because they’ll sell out!!! The display is full of bagels from savory sweet like chocolate chip, red velvet, cinnamon glaze, cheese type like Asiago, Parmesan, jalapeño, wheat, garlic, onion, sesame, everything, blueberry and many more. Mostly all gone by 11:30-12. Great spot has WiFi, a work space area and a corner for kids go play in.< /Text><Date>1569542357459< /Date><name>Nathaniel Buado<//name>< gmapID>

<time>1460313708972<//time><Text>Came over here when we found an hour wait at ihop across the parking lot. I love bagels and these are delicious. Soft and chewy on the inside and a nice crust on the outside. The  people behind the counter were nice and had good customer service. No blueberry bagels, so that was a disappointment to my husband. The store seems a bit clustered with boxes and cases of juice out in the open. Overall, I would definitely come back.<//Text></record></dataset><record>
<text>First off, the bagels are amazing & the bagel sandwiches are delicious!!! Their coffee is good, but not very strong. The place itself is cute and cozy but often cluttered with boxes. I highly recommend visiting this hidden gem!!!</text>< pics>

<Text>If you ask for a toasted bagel it’s usually burnt on the edges, and they only put cream cheese on one half of the bagel...I have gone a few times since they changed to Cassidy’s and I think I am done. Looking for another bagel place.<//Text>< UserId.>

Best little bagel shop in town! Beats panera bread by a mile. Sweet little couple that run the shop they treat every guest like family. I've been going here for 2 years now. Bagel sandwiches are delicious</Review>

That's all well and good, but for an employee on the clock at a business it can come off as pretty unprofessional. If it were a male employee I would say the very same thing. Not the biggest issue in the world but professional appearance should count for something and covering up the stomach is really not that much to ask.</text>< pictures>

It was cool. The garlic butter fries are really good. Our lemon pepper chicken was very...... Lemony ..... If that's a word. Still pretty good though.<//Text>

This is my new favorite chicken wing joint at the moment!

Dispite only having 3 flavors, each flavor is equally delicious. Soy Garlic and Sweet Spicy is tied for my favorite. The breading of the chicken wings are also delicious. The flavors enhance the breading. The wings are also meaty! Each wing is consistent with flavoring, breading, and meatiness.

The fries are the perfect compliment to the wings. They remind me of McDonalds fries. For me, I love the fries. Theh compliment the flavors just as well as the wings do.

Staff has always been pleasant, and happy. I've made several complicated orders for coworkers, and the staff is always helpful.

Haven't tried all food menu items, however this place easily earned my 5 stars!</review>< pics>

Wanted something different for lunch, so we Decided to try Running Chicks... the inside is clear, friendly staff, and the lemon pepper drum sticks that we ordered had great flavor, and was cooked thoroughly. All on All we gave then a 9 out of 10! I'll be back again!<//Review>

Tara Shaw walked me through the estate planning process with patience, courtesy, and professionalism.  It can be intimidating with all the specialized legalese.  Tara knows her stuff and makes it seamless for the lay person.  I would recommend Shaw Legal Office for your estate planning needs.</Review>

<text>Tara Shaw worked with us to prepare trust documents for our family. In her time with us, she was very knowledgeable and worked really fast to complete all of our requests. Communication was very clear and she answered all of our questions in a timely manner. She did all of this and made the process very easy, in spite of the challenges of the Covid-19 pandemic.<//text>< pictures>

<Text>Ms. Shaw was very kind, professional, patient and reasonable in explaining the process to me for setting up my children's Trust. She completed my trust documents within a week of me supplying her the necessary documents, was kind enough to write down clear instructions for me to follow on what was required of me so I would not get confused, and registered my Trust the same day she received my signed trust back and at an affordable price. I highly recommend her.< /Text>< pictures>

<rate>5< /rate><text>I don't leave reviews as a matter of practice, but I had to take the time to write one for Shaw Legal. My husband and I began the very dreaded search of looking for an attorney to help us with estate planning and documentation. If you are like me, selecting an attorney really seems like a shot in the dark, and with something this important, we really wanted to feel like we chose someone who would document our wishes clearly. We happened upon Tara Shaw, and we are really grateful we did. Tara was really easy to work with, very responsive by email, text, and phone, answered any and all our questions thoroughly, and without hesitation, and ultimately, put together our estate plan that matches exactly what we wanted. We recommend Shaw Legal highly and without hesitation. You will be glad you worked with Tara.< /text>< Pictures>

We had a terrific experience working with Tara Shaw. We had been putting off creating wills and trusts because we thought it would be time-consuming and complicated, but she made the process easy and efficient. She is very responsive and professional. I highly recommend her.</text>

Tara helped me with setting up my will and living trust. This is an area of specialty for her. Among those that I have interviewed, she is the most systematic in how she acquires information from clients to make the process easy, smooth and quick for them. She always addressed my concerns and questions promptly as well.</Review>

<review>After conducting our interactions through email and over the phone, we met in person to sign and notarize our Trust Restatement Documents.  Tara was extremely professional, efficient and patient.  I had several detailed questions which she always promptly and clearly answered.  Having gone through a Trust Administration as a Trustee for my father after his passing, I was very particular about how our Trust be drafted and she always met our needs.  Her office was setup for COVID distancing and we felt very comfortable meeting.  Her preparation before the meeting made the process extremely quick and efficient.  Extremely happy we chose her.<//review>< Pics>

<review>Tara was/is EXTREMELY patient. After many questions and email correspondences - all of which Tara took in stride - we got the task of establishing our trust done. There were estate lawyers much closer to us, but because of the glowing reviews, we decided to take a chance on Shaw Legal. We are glad we did.<//review>< Pics>

I would highly recommend Shaw Legal Office.
Tara was prompt in replies to me, thorough in her answers, patient with my numerous initial and subsequent questions, and flexible with her schedule to allow me to come in earlier for signing.  I will definitely return if I have any additional legal needs in the future.</Review>

I was looking to create a Will & Trust for the first time and looked around for what felt like ages until I chose this firm. I was quite intimidated by what the process would be but Tara has a very simple and straight forward process that even a simpleton like me could understand. She was very understanding and patiently answered all of my questions...and trust me, I asked a lot...some good, some dumb. The overall process from start to finish was 2 months...which could have been even quicker if I didn't sit on my thumbs for a couple of weeks.

Overall, very happy and very glad that I chose the Shaw Legal Office. If this is your first time creating a Will or Trust, she makes it very simple and easy to understand. I didn't feel overwhelmed at all.</Review>

<Text>We had an overall positive experience working on our estate planning with the Shaw Legal Office. Tara was helpful and professional and gave us good guidance through the process, which went smoothly and was completed within reasonable time. She was organized and accommodating and it helped also that she had arranged the in-person signing at a satellite office conveniently in our area, so we didn’t have to drive all the way north to her office far from our place. We will definitely seek her service again should the need arise in the future and would gladly recommend her to other people.<//Text>< pics>

<Review>We would give Tara 6 stars if we could!!  We were more than satisfied with the work she did to revise our trust.  She was so organized, smart, responsive, helpful, direct, honest and professional.  She explained complicated things very clearly.  Her end work product was as organized as she is and covered all the necessary things we needed to do to move various assets into our trust.  And in the era of COVID, she was extremely careful with our health.  She was a pleasure with whom to work.  Thanks Tara!<//Review></record>

<review>I found Shaw Legal through my Metlife legal plan at work, and I'm so happy with the results! I needed to establish a Living Trust, and had no idea what I was doing. Tara helped me through the whole process, and always responded in a timely manner. She even came up with a system to do final signings through a solid window to support social distancing by using cell phones to communicate!

Shaw Legal set us at ease with their clearly indicated preset prices. Ms. Shaw saved our estate thousands and the Trust she created will make money immediately available to our beneficiaries by preventing probate.

We were thrilled to find Ms. Shaw after years of being reluctant to create a Trust. She completed a Living Trust for our family in three weeks. This quick process required that we have all our information for her, that we review the emailed draft over a weekend and that we make concise decisions. She made everything easy for us.

She answered difficult questions we had had for years, questions during the process and final questions upon signing. She has encouraged us to call whenever we need her.

We will recommend Shaw Legal for exceptional legal advice for a Trust for every friend & relative we know.< /text>< pictures>

Shaw Legal Office (Tara) were an immense help in creating a trust for both my girlfriend and me. We were putting it off for a while and finally did it. She made it very easy. All we needed to do was answer a questionnaire and she did the rest. Great experience and feel at ease now knowing everything is taken care of.</Text>

My wife and I contacted the Shaw Legal Office in need of having a living trust. Tara was professional, well organized and answered our questions in a timely manner. Due to the Covid-19 situation, we did all of our communication through email except for the signing of the documents which was done outside her office window while communicating via cell phones. Thank you, Tara, for a very pleasant experience.</Text>

We have just wrapped up with Shaw Legal on putting together a simple estate trust plan, and I have to say the whole experience was straightforward, professional, simple, and priced fairly. We originally hd contacted a few different options to seek rates and information, and Tara was by far the best communicator, the most efficient, got back to us in a timely manner, answered all our questions knowledgeably, and even went to the trouble of seeking a consult when we had a complicating out-of-country factor for our estate. Her pricing is very fair, and her system is very simple. We highly recommend her!</text>

I contacted Tara via a personal reference to help get my parents moving on thier end of life legal things. I felicated the meetings between Tara and my parents and after 2 meetings she was able to work directly with them without needing my assistance. My parents tend to avoid uncomfortable things unless initiated/done for them. I was happy she was able to keep my parents on track and follow through with them until the completion of thier trust. It's a huge relief to know that this is done and Tara did a great job. We will continue to keep going to Tara in the future.<//Text>

Tara helped me set up a living trust and it was easier than I expected. She was knowledgeable and flexible with our meeting times. She is responsive and takes care of every minute detail.
I highly recommend using the Shaw Legal Group for anyone looking to create or update their Trust.</Text>

My wife and I recently retained the services of Tara Shaw to update our living trust and will.  We both have very demanding jobs, and since this required both of us to be present, we visited Ms. Shaw’s office during our respective lunch breaks.  Two visits was all it took to get this (albeit very important) business finished.  AND… we were able to squeeze in a couple of noontime meals and get back to work and get back to work in under an hour and a half.  When one embarks down this road of getting sound legal advice and/or service, there are three things you DON’T want:

1.	Getting overcharged
2.	Dealing with an amateur
3.	Unexpected Surprises Down the Road

Ms. Shaw charged us a very modest fee; far below the sum we paid when we initiated the trust with another firm 20 years ago.  She obviously has a great deal of experience and expertise as she was able to answer all our questions to our satisfaction and suggest additional considerations we hadn’t thought of.  By the second visit, despite the fact that we showed up 15 minutes early, she had everything set up and ready-to-go.  She conveyed to us a professional-looking leather binder with all our important papers within; replete with detailed instructions for the next steps and… supplemental documentation that we’ll hopefully never need (e.g. Power of Attorney, health directives, etc.).

No fuss; no muss.  We’re all set for the next 20 years.  Thank you Tara Shaw for your first-rate legal services!

<review>I highly recommend Shaw Legal Office for your estate planning needs.  Tara Shaw is a consummate professional with a keen eye for detail and, perhaps most importantly, a true pleasure to work with.  She answered all of our questions with ease and and an abundance of patience, and helped us to finalize our trust (which we had started and stopped multiple times over the last decade).  We received excellent service for a very fair price. Thank you, Tara!<//review>< pictures>

My husband found Tara from Shaw Legal when we decided that it was time to draw up legal documents after being married and starting our family. Tara welcomed us and made the process simple - she communicated questions and updates clearly and quickly and the overall process was just easy and pleasant. Tara was always so kind when we visited her office and  it was clear she is knowledgeable about her work. While she was happy to explain anything we had questions on, she was great about summarizing legalese. Tara, thank you so much for your help!  We feel better having these documents and it was so nice to meet you!< /Review>

As we are recent retirees to the San Diego area we needed to update and renew our out of date estate planning documents. After contacting the Shaw Legal Office we were emailed a questionnaire asking us what documents we currently had and what services we desired. A meeting was arranged and a short time later we went over our existing estate planning portfolio and agreed upon a course of action. Everything was handled in a very straight forward and professional manner. What a relief it is to now have an up to date estate planning portfolio. I give Shaw Legal Office my highest recommendation.<//Review>

<text>Tara Shaw is a breath of fresh air when it comes to estate planning attorneys in San Diego.  We have worked with other San Diego attorney’s and Tara Shaw is by far the most competent and efficient attorney to work with.  She listens carefully to your concerns, she asks the appropriate questions to get to the core of issues, and she efficiently comes up with good solutions/options to address issues.   Most importantly, her competency in the law is coupled with the laudable qualities of kindness and respect.
Every time we met with Ms. Shaw, she was ready and prepared for the meeting.  We did not have to wait or repeat any information from previous meetings/documentation.  She clearly did her homework.  She remembered all the details and was able to quickly synthesize new information into our documents and plans.
Her office is tasteful, modest and efficient.  It is easy to get to in Bay Park (right off I-5 and Seaworld Drive) with easy parking.  Our kids valued the snacks and books that kept them entertained while we met with Ms. Shaw, while we valued the lack of useless overhead that can be so obnoxiously apparent in other lawyers’ offices.
She has a transparent scheduling system that allowed us to quickly identify dates/times that would work for us.
In summary, Ms. Shaw makes it easy and enjoyable to get your estate in good working order.   We highly recommend her.< /text></record>

<Review>It seems as if Tara is one of the best kept legal secrets in San Diego. I completely agree with these 5-star reviews and think they cover the waterfront on what you can expect.

However, I must point out that another great thing about working with Tara is that her scheduling process is incredibly consumer-friendly. It is rare to be able to look at available appointments and choose something that fits your schedule, rather than seemingly endless back and forths.

She is also incredibly organized, thorough and pays attention to details--exactly what one wants in an attorney.

My husband and I would not hesitate to work with Tara again in the future and recommend her without any reservations whatsoever.< /Review>< user_name>

Tara Shaw did a comprehensive job of taking care of my estate planning and provided needed advice on a living trust. She was readily available to answer any questions I had about the "legalese" that goes into these documents. She is professional and attends to the fine details you want an attorney to focus on. Best of all, she has a friendly and calm demeanor that put me at ease dealing with an issue that felt very weighty and burdensome.</text>

We rarely give 5 stars - as 5 can come across as inflated or solicited.  But that's not the situation here.  Highly recommend Tara Shaw for the following reasons:
1. Professionalism
2. Use of online scheduling system, easy to find mutual free time and to change with enough advance warning
3. She provides calm, grounded energy during this "adult" decision making
4.  Qualified, experienced and associated with ARAG, a membership offered through employer
5.  Location in a neighborhood we've lived in/live near, not only easy to get to for us but she does business amongst the kind of people we are< /review>

< Review>
Tara Shaw is an amazing, helpful, and incredibly talented lawyer who worked hard in my case! Not only did she explain the entire process and all of the steps for my case, regarding legal guardianship, but she made sure that every single document that was required for the case was properly signed and given to the appropriate people. I did not experience a single mishap, or any issues throughout the length of the case, which was not even long thanks to her knowledge of these types of cases. She set up a plan with me on day 1, and we were swiftly able to take care of all issues and submit all documents ahead of schedule.
If you need any help in legal guardianship cases, I GREATLY recommend Tara Shaw's counsel!< /Review>

<Text>Tara was very knowledgeable and professional as she updated a rather shallow trust that I had previously had created. She is very pleasant to work with and was very responsive to any and all inquiries I had. Her ability to provide services as an attorney and notary allowed me to have a complete one stop shop experience. I strongly recommenced her services.

<text>I was diagnosed with cancer and needed to get wills, medical directives, trusts and all the other tasks I had neglected addressed immediately. Shaw Legal stepped right up and cleared my backlog of stupidity, even bringing the documents to me for review and signature when I was unable to get to their office.
The fees charged for all the work was very reasonable. If I live, I would certainly use Shaw Legal for future legal issues.

We met with both and decided to go through with Tara.  She restated our trust, answered all questions we have and was happy with the result.  Everything got done in a timely manner and she even accommodated us on a couple of weekends since we cant make it on weekdays.  Definitely recommend her.<//Review><pics>None</pics>< response>

<text>My wife and I used Tara to create a trust, something we had put off for a very long time because we didn't want to think about the inevitable, plus we thought it would be a time-consuming hassle.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  Tara made the process very accessible and very easy.  It did not take much time at all.

Since we didn't want to burden friends or relatives with handling our affairs after we had "shuffled off this mortal coil," Tara gave us a list of professional fiduciaries and also provided us a website we could use to search on our own.

Our entire experience with Tara, from booking our first appointment to
our final meeting to sign trust documents, was very positive.  As others have noted, she was responsive, timely, professional and very detail-oriented.  We recommend her without hesitation.</text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

Tara prepared our trust and estate docs, and the entire process couldn't have been more easy, efficient and simple.  She took her time to explain the entire process, and what I found especially beneficial is her ability to translate legal jargon into every day language. Tara was very professional, responsive and flexible couple of scheduling conflicts we had. Highly recommended.<//Text>

Ms. Shaw was prompt, professional, and friendly. She answered all of our questions and put up with our foot-dragging on scheduling a second appointment like a champ.

Working with Tara, I have seen her provide the upmost professional experience- she listens, is very informative about the law, and makes her clients feel comfortable, even though thinking about writing your will can be difficult. She has educated not only me but also her clients on all of the ins and outs of Estate Planning, and helps everyone understand the importance of planning for the "what ifs."<//Text>

My first visit here,  I ordered the huevos rancheros. I dined in.
I was not offered chips and salsa.
I was not asked how I would like my eggs, so I incorrectly assumed they would be over easy or over medium, but the eggs were hard, rice and beans on the side.
It was edible but fair at best.</Text>

<Rating>1</Rating><Text>Paid for a unit on 04/16. $218 and some change, which covers me for a month. I get off of work at 4pm in LA and they close at 6, 5 (I thought 530) on the weekends. They have an access gate off of the street that was closed once close to 6 on a weekday, but my experience today was UNREAL! I get here to get stuff out of storage. Get in my car to leave and tend to the rest of my day. The outside gate is locked!!! I’m stuck inside. I called just to get transferred by 3 different agents to 3 different managers vms! Ultimately had to call the fire dept. I’m going down tomorrow morning to request a full refund. WILL NEVER DO SVC HERE AGAIN!<//Text>< pictures>

Great customer service. Stephanie was very friendly and helpful. She followed Covid regulations in the office while getting my paperwork done and it made me feel extra safe. She showed me the unit right away and made sure it was clean before I used it a few minutes later. Lots of parking spaces, close to freeway.</Text>

Stefany and Anthony was wonderful. She helped me with all my needs and was super knowledgeable.

Update: I can't say enough good things about this storage place. Eva helped me secure a dolly when I left mines at home. She saved the day.<//review>

Huge shout out to Anthony and Stefany here- they went above and beyond to help me manage my stuff and make this move happen. When I realized I had requested too small of a unit Anthony found me the right size on the same floor so I didn't have to drag everything all over the facility. Top notch service, friendly staff, and secure storage- recommended!</Text>

My roommates and I were moving out of our apartment super last minute in May and needed extra time in our unit. Jasmine was THE BEST and stayed an extra 1-2 hours after close to ensure that we were able to finish. She made our moving experience so much better, and was super friendly every step of the way. Thank you Jasmine :-)< /Text>

But once I got there, the women who assisted me were EXTREMELY helpful in finding me a unit of the right size, got me set up very easily, and the entire thing ran so smoothly. Shout out truly to Eva + Jasmine for helping us and making this a stress-free experience and for being so friendly and conversational in general :)</Review>< pictures>

<Review>My daughter recently got accepted to USC and we had to place things In storage until she moves on campus. Dominick and Asia were so kind and patient with us as we figured out which size unit would be best, and explaining the process to us and my daughter. She will be on her on and they made us more than comfortable with the whole process.

Thanks<//Review>< Pics>

Jasmine was so lovely and helpful about keeping our items safe in between moves. She even stayed passed closing time to help us get all of our belongings out of our storage unit. She’s the G.O.A.T.<//Review>

< Review>
Moving is always stressful but Mario made this experience seemless from the phone call to the end of the move. Everyone was very helpful but special shout out to Mario and I believe her name was Jasmine!  I’ve seen Jasmine at other locations and she’s always the one with all the knowledge!

Thank you again to everyone that helped me! 💖< /Review>

<text>Excellent customer service! The manager Jeffrey was quick and efficient with explaining all the paperwork and processing. I even bought some moving supplies that I didn’t think I needed until he and his coworker explained to me the benefits of using their products for my storage unit. Highly recommend this location. Friendly staff and exceptional management!</text>< Pictures>

Came into Public Storage with a friend to help them move out. We spoke to an employee by the name of Eleanna. She was very friendly and made sure we moved out easy and quickly. Would definitely recommend this location to everyone. The place was also very clean and had a warm environment. 5 stars for sure.< /review>

public storage is unethical. They donr give homeless people a chance and how would they feel if everything were taken from them from the top down. Give people community service and a chance to work off their fees and get their storage. Public storage will keep your treasures and you still owe them money and it goes on your credit report and that is theft and white collar crime. I will never store with them again. Society has changed maybe you could change and be kinder so people can keep their things instead of you being such a wicked parasite.< /text>

By far the best service I have ever received at a Public Storage.  Alexus and Eliza were very helpful in explaining my options and showing me the units.  They were very patient with me and actually brought a smile to my face.  Great job Ladies you never know what someone is going through and how much a little patience helps.< /Text>

My experience so far has been great!

My property manager Eliza, has been very helpful, in showing me the proper size storage for my storage items and making sure I understand all the requirements, and safety at this public storage location.

Eliza is a pleasure to work with, and very helpful to all the customers in the building, and on the phone.

She is a whiz on the computer, and has outstanding customer service.

She will make things Right if there is a problem.

The property is kept clean, and that is a big plus for your storage items.

This public storage is a pleasure to go to if need be, do to its customer service team.< /text>

Once again, Eliza was professional and very helpful. She made it simple to rent a space for a third time. She suggested the best way to do it.

very conveniently located near USC. Eliza has been great with both of my daughters so this is the second time we have rented a space. excellent service.<//text>

First of. If you own a unit here and are trying to call to ask a question good luck. You cant. If you're trying to rent a unit you get connected right away. Staff at least on a monday is horrible. Unprofessional and downright unhelpful.<//text>

<Text>I would normally rate Public Storage a 1 star because their business ethics are the worst.  However, I give them a 3 today because of the customer service of Raelyce.  She is a bright spot in the company, and Public Storage is lucky to have her.  I've been a customer for many years and have had storage units at three locations.  If I could rate Raelyce separately from the company, she would get 5 stars.< /Text><Time>1548617184111< /Time>< Rating>

Great location and staff! Princess was very helpful, courteous, and professional. I really couldn't tell she's was new because of her confidence and great personality! I've used public storage at a different location where the staff was rude, but the staff at this USC location is much more welcoming. Princess was very nice and did a great job ensuring I had everything I needed for my storage room!< /Review>

my experience at this facility overall has been fairly good, Raelyce  is amazing, she is always  incredibly helpful and accommodating with a pleasant and inviting attitude, I always see her smiling and being helpful.
I had originally moved in here for 3 montha temporary storage yet this enthusiastically charming young Lady has inspired me to continue renting here even though I live in the valley now💜<//review>

<Review>In the midst of all the madness from moving from one state to another an angel popped up and smoothed out my entire situation. This storage facility has it all including easy freeway access, a loading dock and excellent parking for my semi-truck. (***Bonus*** Great customer service!)
If you are ever in need of a storage facility I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this place for business.</Review>< Pictures>

It was a really great experience. We just gave them a call 30 min prior and they showed us the storage and the renting process was easy and smooth.
Katrina was super nice, friendly and energetic.
The facility looked clean, neat, and very professional.
Overall it was great!<//Text>

I came in to make a payment for my mom and now I have some questions about storing. I was helped by Dawn, she was sweet and very attentive. It's hard to find great customer service at many places but she impressed me with hers. Very good experience!<//Review>

I went to this public storage and I was very stressed about moving. Katrina is the person that helped me. She was so friendly and her spirit was so sweet. I was able to vent to her and she never rushed me along. I left there feeling a lot better than when I came. Go to this public storage and ask for katrina</text>

<Text>We had a great experience working with Katrina today. Booked online, got a call from her like  minutes later, and found the place easily near DMV.

Katrina was real professional and friendly, and when we visited we immediately booked the first floor space.

Recommend to all!

<Time>1388173500918<//Time><resp>None< /resp><Review>First I like to say I was happy paying $70.- a month for storage rent when I first opened my account this past January 2013, then I was notified by mail that my storage rental would increase from $70.- to $100.- as of July 2013 and I was not happy about that.

Second of all the hours of operation you as a tenant is only allowed access during business hours Monday thru Sunday and if you are there after business already inside once you leave you cannot re-enter which is foolish to confused tenants that have access 24 hours...

Third of all the staff meaning the Customer Service Desk Staff is just horrible the Spanish girl who works there has a nasty attitude and does not know how to talk to clients in a professional nor acknowledge or greet clients professionally.

The Hispanic male associate is somewhat okay in acknowledging and greeting clients but he looks as if he is in another continent of the world and not down to earth.

The Property Manager is very nice, professional, and acknowledges in welcoming and appreciative manner.</Review><gmapID>0x80c2c80a9c130ffd:0xfa6066b3ddcb7e10</gmapID><pics>None<//pics></record></dataset><record>

I went about last week to rent out a unit with my father and the young lady that helped us out was very friendly. She made sure that all of our questions were answered since we had no clue about the terms since it was our first time needing the storage. Very knowledgeable and patient because we had lots of concerns and questions. Didn't make me feel like an nincompoop since i had no idea of how public storage works. Her name i believe was Dianna or Dianne. She had glasses and always smiling. Thanks for providing me with excellent customer service im glad i made business with you guys.< /Text>

Do not take your thing to this storage. All of my thing were STOLEN. And the employees could care less. When I told them my storage was burglarized, no one apologized or had any sympathy for my situation. They simply continue to try to take my monthly payment! Really! ... After the Police report was file, the officer stated "There storages are burglarized ALL the time so Im not surprised." Furthermore , ORANGE DOOR is a SCAM. The company is owned by public storage and I was told it could take up to a year before I recieve any compensation.<//text>

I moved out because they do not care about keeping the facility clean also there aren't any cameras on any of the floors so people do as they please.  Someone kept urinating on the corner of my unit, it was disgusting the pee got inside on the edges of it and  the smell was so strong bc it fermented in the corners even bubbles were at the surface of it.<//text>

<Review>I am a student at USC and live far away, so I have been renting with Public Storage at this location for the last three years. This year, the rents were raised (a lot), and spaces in the size I needed were no longer available (though there were listings the day before), so naturally, I expressed my disappointment over the phone to the poor employee who answered. When I showed up to move in, prepared to pay an inordinate sum of money for storage, the employee who had answered, Patty, remembered me and informed me that a customer had just moved out of a much more reasonably sized/priced unit. She and Catrina provided excellent customer service, and Public Storage at this location is a great and convenient option for students/faculty nearby.<//Review>< Resp>

I had such a great experience today! Deiseree was extremely amiable and helpful. It was very hot and I was pressed on time, but Deiseree provided such great customer service so that I was able to get my stuff done before the location closed. Everything went smoothly! There's more than enough parking, and I'm so glad she recommended that I go to La Mercado de la Paloma, a group of restaurants right next to the public storage, to grab a delicious bite to eat after!<//Text>

DO NOT RENT FROM HERE!! I REPEAT DO NOT RENT FROM HERE THEY ARE SCAMMERS & THE INSURANCE PEOPLE! THEY HAVE BUGS & ROACHES  INSURANCE DOES NOT COVER EVERYTHING EVEN WITH FULL COVERAGE! ALL OF THE DAMAGED ITEMS THEY'LL ONLY GIVE YOU $250!! SWITCHING STORAGES NOW. They tried to spray before we can take pictures for insurance. So we took pics of what we can.</Review>

<text>I needed a storage unit for my furniture and belongings while I travel for a few months, and I settled on this location because the price was right. Moving day turned out to be as rushed and stressful as you can imagine, but I underestimated the time it would take to load up the U-Haul and get downtown from West Hollywood. I rushed there and made it around 4:45pm but they close at 5pm, so I was losing my marbles that I would be in an awful, awful predicament of not being allowed to empty the U-Haul into the unit, butttt Katrina and Patty were absolute saints and expedited the paperwork, while my roommate started loading my stuff into the unit. Katrina and Patty were so calm and helpful and even let me switch to a bigger size unit after I viewed the one I was meant to have. They set me at ease and EVEN tolerated me the next day when I took a carload of boxes to the unit at, again.. 4:45pm when they closed at 5pm. These women are the reason why I did not have an anxiety attack on moving weekend, and so far I am super happy with having chosen this location. Thank you so much, ladies!!!</text>< Pics>

All these reviews before are completely not true. All these customers have been tricked or begged to give a good review. Im coming back from my review b4 and say this place is nasty and these girls Paulina and Eliza are careless and unprofessional. I just saw a roach and a mice going behind my unit. I told that lady paulina who seem to be on the internet all the time, that behind my unit is creepy and nasty with food that has been there for years. Til now it's still there. I tried to reach upper management but their phone is neither working. I already signed this damn rent otherwise i would pay more to rent somewhere else. You do not wanna even think of coming here. Its nasty. Some people think they can tolerate dirt and everybody should. Nasty!< /Review>

<Text>I was working on a project near there and needed to store some parts, since my company do a lot of work in the area I thought it would be nice to keep product near the jobsite. Well after to weeks someone who  I assume was the manager called me 2 days in a row the 2nd day leaving a message telling me their is an urgent message and I need to call. I'm thinking a break in? She goes on threatening me with late fees on the 25th I said I have only had the unit for 2 weeks I'm not late. She said it was a curtisy call No it's  harassment!!! We argued and I hung up on her. I'm out.< /Text>< rating>

<Text>(Translated by Google) Bad service. The person who treated me with a very bad temper and it seems that she was the owner of the place and they want to charge her what she wants, not as she has booked online 😡
