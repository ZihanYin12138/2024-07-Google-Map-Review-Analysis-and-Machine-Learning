It was very beautiful. Though the museum and gift shop was small. The local historical society and community are really working at putting together some more informative and interesting events.< /review>

< review>
St Raphael is the Archangel of Health.

And boy is he handsome!

Being healthy is being wealthy and being wealthy from health is Wise and Wisdom brings real lasting Joy.

So Archangel Raphael is by far a good guide for us to consider:
Rest, healthy food, and prayer to have a good heart along with lots of exercise daily is what Archangel Raphael encourages.

The church itself is beautiful. People are people,  not always nice but they try.
The service is usually a helpful one to start the week and there is a prayer book to write prayer wishes to have prayed by the clergy there.

There is a beautiful room on the left with the Virgin De Guadalupe inside, or is it Mother Mary? I think both.
The beautiful stars in that room make for such a beautiful sleep.

The majority of the attendees are hispanic so sometimes that can be a bit much without enough diversity, but overall the church still has a mission they try to upkeep.

There is a full blown school there and many other projects going on. There is a lovely store that sells nice crosses and gifts.
I had to ask for the ascended swedish cross to be ordered though because this cross is very rare in the U.S.

Some of my friends who attend from time to time and my family, we enjoy taking the best from the experience and work in our little ways towards the type of improvement that Archangel Raphael would approve.< /review>

< Review>
200th anniversary of the founding of this historic California Mission, dedicated to the Angel Rafael, the Healer. The well-meaning missionary Padres, like so many of the European colonizers, contributed to the decimation of the Native peoples who they came to "evangelize".  Masses here are in Spanish, Vietnamese, Portuguese and English. A warm and inviting parish Community.<//Review>

While not much of the original Mission is left, the site remains worth a visit if interested in Mission history. The dedication to Saint Raphael (patron of health) and the use of the site for medical purposes were very interesting.<//review>

<review>Many people confuse Old Mission San Rafael with the current replacement Mission San Rafael. Others confuse it with the Church of Saint Raphael. If you're looking for the historical old mission, it just doesn't exist anymore.

Old Mission San Rafael was founded in 1817. Originally built to serve as a sub-mission and hospital to Mission San Francisco, it basically contained two adobe structures that served as a hospital building and housing for the Catholic Fathers. It did eventually receive mission status.

By 1844, after Mexican Secularization, Old Mission San Rafael was abandoned. Completely in ruins, another church was built nearby in 1885. Old Mission San Rafael was completely torn down by 1870. At that time, only a single pear tree was listed as the last remnant at the original mission site.

Even the church built in 1885 no longer exists. The striking Church of Saint Raphael was built here in 1919. It is adjacent to the smaller Mission church.

During a rush to save California's historic mission ruins along the Camino Real, this mission was different. There were no ruins. There were no records, drawings or pictures existing that showed what the original Mission looked like. In 1949 when architects designed Mission San Rafael, an old romanticised postcard was used as a basis of its construction. Mission San Rafael was rebuilt using a fictional image drawn by Felix Raymaud.

All that remains of Old Mission San Rafael are the original bells. Three currently hang outside the doors of Mission San Rafael.

If visiting Mission San Rafael, the museum and gift shop are currently closed on Mondays and Tuesdays.< /review>< Name>

Interesting historic site, although the mission is basically a reconstruction with only limited fidelity to the original.  Nice little museum.<//text>

< review>
The service with Father Teodore was absolutely wonderful. But unfortunately it was a lot of people packed like Sardines!!     in that a little Chapel, and the big Church was
Close and locked. We need more of Father
Teodoro Dirk Kranz. I'm a  Catholic and I came back to the Catholic Church through a
Priest  like Fr. Dirk Kranz.</review>

A word of caution: this is the site of the San Rafael Mission. Nothing remains from the mission period except for a couple of artifacts in the gift shop. There's not much to see, so don't go out of your way to visit. It's really just a parish church and school these days.< /review>

(Translated by Google) In San Rafael downtown it is also not that there are many things to do, although charming, and the mission is a small oesis among the most modern constructions.

The place keeps a lot of history about San Rafael and the historical moment of Hispanic California.

(Original)
En San Rafael centro tampoco es que haya muchas cosas por hacer, aunque encantador, y la misión es un pequeño oásis entre las construcciones más modernas.

El lugar guarda mucha historia acerca de San Rafael y el momento histórico de la California hispánica.</Text>

<gmap_id>0x80c2b58f8832d48f:0x53e3af39ea452ab9</gmap_id><review>It's time to go to small claims court.  We paid $1490 to fix motor mounts, left & right wheel bearing, replaced two tires, thermostat, gasket and 2 rear brake drum.  It turns out that the car is making the worst mechanical noise after driving it less than 20 miles.  The bearings have shredded!  It is time to go to legal court and use the media to bring truth on what kind of "repair" on this establishment.  I am determined to find justice and protect the little people from untruthful, deceitful all time low scammer.  It's about time the public know that Tony's Auto Repair Center is nothing but an auto scam machine.</review><Response>None< /Response><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPRGXXxFFPxPHgo-YeFeXFSsTwPEOCiHAhBz83p=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics>< UserId.>

< review>
The owner Tony was super nice, honest and easy to work with. I was in an accident so my car needed a new headlight and bumper. He tried getting the cheapest prices which I appreciated. Some places don’t care how much you will have to pay. My car was done in a decent amount of time (roughly a few days). When I went to pick up my car I forgot to bring cash for the balance due (I thought I would use a credit card). He was very nice about bringing the money the next day and let me take my car anyways. The job was excellent and the paint job work was superb for the amount of money spent. I'm so happy I took the referral to go here.<//review>

<Review>I have been coming to tony for years. It’s hard to find a honest mechanic. And that’s what this shop is. I came to Tony’s Auto repair in Gardena with my car and Within 24 hours Tony was able to tell me all what was wrong and it’s not even worth fixing; Instead of fixing something and me having to come back. I like there quality and honest. They are worth a referral. Hello guys at TONYS< /Review>< pics>

Tony's auto shop is without a doubt my main shop and if you are not satisfied Tony will make sure your car will be taking care of but also give you the best price and will make sure the problem is solved and complete.I use to go too the dealer found out that they were just a pocket dealer.< /review>

<Review>One of the pizzerias I've had. The foods are amazing, the service is great, and the prices are good enough to buy some. And, in the menu for pizzas, there are a lot of choices for toppings, which is better than Domino's Pizza and Pizza Hut. I'd recommend it.<//Review>< Gmap_id>

*UPDATE 4-1-21* Lately, I've had issues with the delivery drivers being lazy and making excuses to not bring orders to the door. If Pizza Go drivers aren't delivering to the door, then what's the point of having a "delivery notes" and "details" section on your website?! Instead it should say "drivers will not deliver to door". I've been at this address for over 20 years and never had any delivery drivers complain about parking with hazard lights on for deliveries. Fact is, some drivers are flat out lazy and unwilling to walk an extra 45 steps which makes me lose faith in ordering for delivery from this business. Based on recent experiences, 3 stars.
Located in Koreatown with ZERO parking. I recommend ordering delivery although a small pickup window is available. You can also utilize their website with its numerous misspelled words and odd discounting. For the creative pizzas they make the delivery time is good and I must admit that their pizzas are quite bo-delicious! Only pet peeves I have is when you order extra side items such as Ranch sauce, drinks, etc. They sometimes forget to deliver it with your order and my credit card has been mysteriously overcharged by $10 before, which they'll refund the next day once you call to complain. They will be unaware of it without your inquiry. Overall, my experience with Pizza Go has been a good one! 4 Stars! (Try the Tater-Tot pizza, 🤯)< /Text>

Everything is good. Food taste great. However, on their website they have coupons that they don't honor it when you choose for pick up. Don't bother with coupons, they aren't honoring them at all!< /Text>

Pizza here is pretty! The Sweet Potato Pizza is what drew me to this place but we also ordered the Ranch Chicken Pizza. The sweet potato was pretty good, but I'm not sure if I really like the mix of cheese and sweet potato puree. I think if it had more of the sweet potato all around I would have been more on board. We both ended up liking the Ranch Chicken Pizza, goes really well with their special Garlic Ranch dipping sauce. There's a ton of yummy looking specialty pizzas and I'll definitely order from here again over the national pizza chains.</review>

I love Pizza Go! My son’s favorite pizza! The staff is always so nice and accommodating. I always order the same thing but for some reason this time they got it wrong. So I called, just to inform them of the mistake and they wanted to send me a whole new pizza. I actually had to beg them not to! Impeccable customer service! They’re awesome!<//Review>

<pics>None< /pics><review>Very good pizza. We love their pizza and wings. Their prizes are good too. I only give 4 star because there were few pieces of sausage or some kind of meat on our veggie pizza. We are non vegetarians so we didn’t mind too much but if someone is strictly vegetarian, it could be a huge problem.<//review>< Date>

This was a buzzy restaurant with a great ambiance. Terrific service and friendly waiters. The food was pretty good and included some interesting menu choices. We shared Sicilian pizza and Lasagne. Our main courses were a tempura red snapper with wildflower plants. Great food at a very agreeable price! Highly recommended!<//review>

This restaurant is certainly one of the tastiest restaurants in the area. Every time I come to this place I am deeply happy. They preserve their high  level service and the highest level of dishes  they give. You will be always satisfied with this place. Very  recommended.< /review>

Their combination is a must. This small mom and pop shop serves some amazing pizza. It's different from your pizza hut or dominos. It's not a pie or New York style pizza. It has it's own distinct taste. If you've never tried and want to try pizza in ktown, this place is it. I've been ordering for over 5 years and it's always consistent. They make their own dough and they use two different types of cheese. They also give you a red sticker, collect 10 and you get a free pizza.< /Text>

Wow! What a great find for vegan pizza selection! Not only was the staff friendly and accommodating, the pizzas were delicious! Super quick turnaround time from order to plate. Can't wait to eat the leftovers!
Tip: inside seating is small and they have a few tables outside which is great for nice weather.< /review>

Best. Pizza. Ever. I've never had a more amazing pizza ever before. The wait was reasonable, you pay up front (cash only), service is phenomenal, flavors are AMAZING. This place is in such a beautiful part of downtown La Verne. Definitely a great place for some delicious food (at a great price) and great ambiance!< /Review>

Best pizza in LA. It's not fancy, or gluten free, or any of that BS. Its consistent great tasting pizza without any of the gimmicks. Meat Eaters deluxe with extra garlic and jalapenos.</Review>

This is hands down my favorite pizza go in the Bay Area, and I have tried a lot of pizza in the 20 plus year I have lived here.  I spent a year in Italy when I was in college and returned with a great appreciation for good thin crust pizza.  I know that good to me, may not be good to someone else.  Everyone has their own taste.  And I am a firm believer that any pizza taken home should be reheated on a pizza stone for maximum Pizza Go<//Review>

Went there with high expectations and it lived upto it. Their fries were the best thing I had. Wouldn't necessarily go with the cheese fries since they use mozzarella on it. Also had the chicken gyro and a pizza slice which were good too.

Quick service and tasty food!</Text>

<Text>I am pretty surprised that this guy can get a crist like this out of an oven like that, I think he's probably doing something special with a combination of flour.

anyway a pizza like this is going to be very hard to beat.   i'd say it's somewhere between Vera pizza and a New York street pizza, but it is remarkably good.

<time>1354336361855</time><Review>Called three times for delivery order. The guy hung up on me three times by mistake. Succeeded to make an order at my fourth try and was ready to wait 40~45 min. After 30 min of waiting, I've got a phone call saying that my place is too far for delivery.
I heard their pizza is good and that's why I called them four times to make an order.
Now I don't care if the food is good or not. It can be worth try but I won't come back.
Be careful when you make a delivery order.< /Review>< userid>

Pizza is solid here. Wings are average.

This is not a sit-down restaurant... It's a place that you can stop by on your way home or have them deliver. There is literally no sit down area, just a pick-up window. They have a deal where you can buy 10 pizzas and get one for free. Their ranch sauce is the best- made from scratch!

If you want a pizza that is not too greasy (like Pizza Hut/Dominos), and not too Korean (like Mr. Pizza), then this is the place to try!</text>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) The sweet potato pizza is really disappointing. Two minutes after I wrote a review here, I ordered the sweet potato pizza because it was really delicious and recommended. .ㅡㅡ;;;
When I first bite it, the garlic taste is strong. The sweet potato is crushed and put on the pizza. It is a pizza made with bitter garlic and green onions.
This is the worst pizza I've ever eaten!!!!! I couldn't eat a piece with my friend, so I threw it all away!!!! Really tasteless

(Original)
고구마 피자 정말 실망입니다.   여기 리뷰 쓰신 2분보면 고구마 피자 정말 맛잇고 추천한다고해서 오더햇는데.    .ㅡㅡ;;;
처음 한입 베엇을때 마늘에쓴맛이 강하게 나요..  고구마는 으깨서 피자위에 살짝 올렷을쁀..   쓰디쓴마늘 과 파 가 잇는피자임.
이제껏 먹어본 피자중에 최악임!!!!! 친그와 한조각 도 먹지 못하구 다 버렷음!!!!   정말 개 맛없음<//Review>

<Text>(Translated by Google) On the weekends, you have to wait for orders.
If you wait with time, you can find a delicious pizza.

주말에는 주문이 밀려 기다려야 한다.
여유를 갖고 기다리면 맛 좋은 피자를 만날 수 있다.</Text>< Pictures>

<userid>104918756370583385903<//userid><Text>(Translated by Google) This is a really delicious pizza shop. The Korean boss is very kind. This is where you always order without regrets. It is a little inconvenient when picking up due to the narrow parking lot, but it would be nice to have a drive-in system because it works well. Personally, I recommend hot Hawaiian pizza and sweet potato pizza.

정말 맛있는 피자가게 입니다.한국사장님이 아주 친절합니다. 후회없이 항상 주문하는 곳입니다. 주차장이 협소하여 픽업할때는 조금 불편하지만 잘되서 드라이브인 시스템이 되면 좋을듯 합니다.개인적으로는 핫하와이안 피자와 고구마피자 를 추천합니다.<//Text>< Pics>

It's not salty and the bread isn't too thick, so I think I'll use it often.

<text>Office people are very courteous. Office and restrooms are very clean, free coffee and drinking water available.
Once inside of the safety gate, there is driving access to the units....and other than the rents increase 3 times in less than 2 years, I have no complaints.<//text>< Date>

All storage is outside in shipping containers with 7 days a week 12 hours a day access. Except major holidays. Which is great for my mobile business. Grounds are clean and cats keep the rodents out.</review>

Great facility, that is both clean and safe. The staff are professional and friendly and there are security cameras that monitor the premises as well as patrolman that routinely surveys the areas as well.  It also has easy access to the units where you can drive right up to them as well.</Text>

The manager Manuel is a total prick, the website says call for assistance and all he tells is that you have to come in personally cause he can't discuss nothing over the phone... Either fix the site or you gotta do better to help the customer after all you are getting payed....</review>

Excellent! So well organized. Thank you to all of the staff. Person who checked my dog in was friendly. Veterinarian giving the shot was professional. Person who gave me the certificate after my dog received the shot was kind and patient. She took time to answer my questions.<//text>

Nice inexpensive way to get your dog or cat vaccination but hard to get a hold of someone if you have specific questions. Had to email them and did get an answer but it took a few try’s via email and phone.<//review>

<review>I normally have a good fast and accurate service but today I don’t know if they was having a bad day but VERY UNORGANIZED  I made it 10 mins early to my 11am appt just to pick up my dog flea meds that was already paid for they was helping everybody else that came after me and the vet man accused me of trying to argue when I got out my car asking what’s going on really made me felt some type of way this was the location in the target parking lot in Vallejo</review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

Extremely fast service with no fluff. I love their online platform and how easy it is for us to obtain service and access to our pet records online.

It is best to set up your pet record online and schedule your appt ahead of time. On the day of service simply drive to the designated location and wait in your car for their text. When it is your appt time, they text you and have everything prepped for your pet.

The vet does their thing and will address any question you may have. Of course, they also have a lot of customers waiting so don't expect to be able to cannibalize their entire time. If you want that type of service, go to a brick and mortar vet.

Once your pet is in their system, you will also get email remainders.  Thst works not very well for our furry family members.<//Review>

<Review>The staff that comes out to run these clinics are absolutely fantastic. They have a lot of patience when it comes to dealing with pet owners. When I’m standing there waiting I see a lot of different personalities but the staff are  able to be calm and courteous while directing all of us to where we need to be.

Thank you for keeping the prices affordable so we can keep our pets healthy even when money is a struggle.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None</resp>< GmapID>

This is an organized and efficient operation- I am always impressed by how well they wrangle so many people and pets. I appreciate the low price on vaccines to keep my pets and my community safe. I highly recommend this clinic to anyone who needs shots for their dogs and cats.</text>

Quick and easy. Show up with pet (must stay in the car), wait in line, give then their info, then when it's your turn, grab your pet and receive the shot for less than half the cost of a clinic visit<//Text>

< Review>
Hands down the best vet clinic in Sacramento . . . I've taken puppies to other vets before and they've gotten sick from them over doing it on the vaccines . . . At Yolano they take the puppies age/weight among other things into consideration . . . It seems like most every other Vet you go to these days is trying to sell you something extra you don't really need, not to mention the hidden costs . . . Yolano Mobile Pet Clinic is the real deal, they love what they do . . . The last of a dying breed</Review>

Arrive early to avoid the heat for your pets/animals as well as yourself, your friends &/or family. Your pet will have to be in your vehicle with A/C running (until called up to get their vaccinations) accompanied by a friend and/or family member of yours to keep them company & watch your vehicle to prevent theft of your vehicle &/or pet(s). Cats must be in a carrier or pillowcase for yours & their own safety. Dogs must be on a leash when not inside vehicle. All of this information is on their website. As well as dates, locations & time ranges they are in each place. They're in Sacramento County once a month, one weekend on a consecutive Saturday & Sunday.<//Review><pics>None< /pics><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

Went to get my pitbull his annual shots, everyone--except for one staff, were professional and got their jobs done. However, when we got to the point to where our dog went to get his shot, he started to cause a scene in front of other people, and made wild accusations that our dog was out for him. Just because he was a pitbull, and because he barked once. Sorely disappointed with how he behaved toward us. Thus, is why I give a 2 stars rating.< /text>

< Review>
Subway another best option for vegetarian people , order veggie delight best option it's my all time favorite ,6 foot long (🍞 9 grain wheat ) u can order it's enough for 2 people n finally wats goes inside is all ur choice ,my choice is always some American cheese,lattuce ,black olives,capsicum,onions,tomato, mayonnaise and Chipotle sauce that's all perfect to eat fully flavoured veggie delight . It's cost is just $7.05</Review>

We chose Subway Restaurants to cater our office lunch with two days notice and they delivered, literally and figuratively, above and beyond. They arrived 10 minutes earlier than our scheduled delivery time and helped with set up. We will definitely be using Subway Restaurants again for future catering needs. Thank you for the delicious comfort food and excellent service.</Review>

All over the place, the subway sandwiches tastes somewhat same. But customer service matters, I don’t find that in this location. Some rude employees are there, not everyone.</review>

<date>1548218056567< /date><Review>Bad service i asked lady working here for cheesey garlic bread which i always get but instead of meat i always ask for veggie Patty.

But that lady said no no no we cannot make it there is no way to make it

I just said instead of meatballs or meat just add veggie Patty but she said it is not possible at all it can never be done no one can make like that.. like seriously i always get it from another subway restaurants...

For me this is the one of the worst subway restaurant i have been.< /Review></record>

<Review>The food wasn’t that good., may be due to COVID. The pho broth was oily and the egg rolls were sweet. The meat was sweet also, this food tasted more like Chinese food. Food looks good but doesn’t taste that good.<//Review><Response>None< /Response>< Name>

My daughter and I came here today. The service is horrible. Order soup and did not like it. They refused to accommodate. They acted like it was our fault the food sucks. I would never ever come here again. They need to learn to speak English since they run a restaurant.< /Review>

All I’ve tried so far was banh mi but man, it was BOMB! Large, stuffed, I asked for extra toppings and they gave them, ratios of ingredients were PERFECT👌 The sauce was better than any I’ve tasted in the past too.</Review>

< Review>
Today I went here, first my concern is I came before all the other customers but I was served last I don't know why 2nd when I said I wanted a well done steak and there still red on the meat and the ladies called The Cook I guess the guy came out and then pick up my fork and he said you can dip your meat a little bit and it will go away I don't know but I don't I don't like what the way he did touching my Fork right before I start eating. And lastly this is probably the worst one, I was still eating halfway done my food still a lot my baby still eating and the lady started cleaning the tables and she sprayed it and I smelled and tasted the spray what to use to clean the other table. It's so nasty I had to leave I paid though good luck to you guys<//Review>

I really enjoyed the house special P2 Pho. The restaurant was clean and the service was very friendly.  I wanted to sample more but my belly wouldn't let me. I will be returning soon. A side note, bring cash because they have a $10 minimum for card use.</review>

Not impressed by the service and the people who work at the House of Pho.  The most very Sorry Sad and Pathetic Pho restaurant in National City.  My advice is to go somewhere else.   I ordered two orders one to eat in and one to take out.  My in house order was cold  and not very good and gave me diarrhea.  My second order just sat there on the counter for 45 minuets or longer (I thought they were cooking my order) when I finally asked about my order they tried to give and serve me the food that had just been sitting on the counter.  ( very unhealthy and a high potential for sickness and food born illnesses). I didn’t pay and left the restaurant never to return.< /review>

The pho here is decent.  The taste is good (not excellent nor outstanding) and the prices are reasonable.  They do put significantly fewer noodles than other places, so there have been occasions that someone in my party has had to ask for extra noodles (obviously charged).  The spring rolls are fresh and flavorful and the beef skewers are yummy.

Parking can be hit or miss.  There are a lot of businesses in this strip mall and during peak times you may end up having to park over by the Jack in the Box where there's more parking.  The place is clean, I've never had to use the bathroom.

Service is VERY hit or miss here.  I've read some of the surveys about the lady taking orders "sighs deeply like she's being bothered."  I know exactly whom you guys are talking about, my friends and I nickname her Surly.  Half the time she's friendly and talkative, the other half she acts like she absolutely hates being there and it shows.  If you happen to catch her when she's sitting and eating, which has been MANY times in my experience, she will be in a bad mood 100%, as she gets up with a sigh and an eyeroll.  C'mon, people, give this lady an  uninterrupted 30-minute lunch break in the back or before/after her shift so she's not in a bad mood half the time.

In a nutshell, this is a decent place with quick service and decent food.  It's not a place you go out of your way to visit, but if you happen to find yourself within 1 mile or so  and feeling like pho it's not a bad decision either.</text>

If you've ever read my reviews before, I'm not big on criticizing the "taste" factor. How good a meal is, depends on each individual palate.

The place was decent. I can't complain there. Clean and simple. No surprises. I stopped in, this morning, and had the P2- House Special. And in my opinion, the pho was good. I can't complain there either. And at least the price was decent.

The only thing that was a bummer for me, was the service. After my meal, I was clearly done and ready to go. I waited for a little bit to grab my check and a container for my left overs. Eventually, I got up and walked to the counter to find someone. It turns out the lady was literally hiding down behind the counter, texting on her phone. Not very business like. It was obviously laid back to say the least. No biggie, but minus one star for that.

Cheers :)< /Text>

First time there. Ordered 3 drinks to go and the lady receiving the order gave a deep sigh like it was a hassle for her. I heard great reviews about this place from friends. Hesitant to return back.</Text>

It has been almost a year since my abuser attacked me, I still remember that day, and parts of it still haunt me. The actions of the City of Bakersfield's address data breach have completely impacted and changed my life. I cannot even begin to describe the feelings of terror I felt when I was attacked by my would be fiance.

I spent over three months hospitalized and endured six surgeries. I am including photos for you to see. I could speak for hours about the complications in care, the financial burden it has had on my family, the stress of not being able to work and struggling to get assistance. The pain I suffer knowing the city has made my address available for him to get is unbearable. It was in moments like this that I had to remind myself that I have control over what has been taken from me. I am a survivor. I am still the same person that I was before this happened to me. But now I have scars and old wounds that remind me of how strong I have become. You haven’t taken away my will to live, you haven’t broken my spirit. These scars are a constant reminder of what happened but don’t define my future.

Councilman Gonzales, Mr. Clegg, Mayor Goh ... we want you to know how the city's posting of deeds online has impacted us and do more to protect the victim's whose addresses Bakersfield posted on the city's website. What is the city doing? Why can't I get a response from our city? You should be recalled.<//Text>

I have been a client of Stewards Inc. for over 11 years and I have NEVER had a single problem with the services that I recieve there. I would recommend  them to anyone that needs to have a payee. I have moved out of Bksfld but remain in Kern County and although I  may have to travel to Bksfld. once in a while to go into their office, I don't mind. I have the option to use an alternate payee that is closer to me yet I prefer to stay with Stewards Inc.
Thank You to all of the staff at Stewards for everything that you do for me.< /Review>

For the better part of 20 years. Never a problem. And if I thought that their was a problem. Thy took care of it fast. Thy have always treated me with the utmost respect. Even when I went in there thinking there was a problem. Thy have to deal with so many different kinds of people. To put it nicely. I don't think I've ever seen him disrespect anyone. And being a client with them for 20 years. I've seen quite a few crazy things that has happened in that office. Thy have a grate staff of people that do care about their clients.

(Translated by Google) The place is very busy. There was a very strange smell upstairs. The food, despite being posted on a website, was not. We didn't get a key for the room.
Cheap but not for me not worth it.

(Original)
A hely nagyon lelakott. Az emeleten nagyon furcsa szag volt. Étel -a weboldalon írtak ellenére- nem volt. A szobához nem kaptunk kulcsot.
Olcsó, de nem számomra nem érte meg.</Text>

<review>This is a solid location for the franchise. I always find the fries to be underdone for my taste, but I recently got a tip to order them "well done". Much better! Also, ask for fried onions.

Definitely makes for a satisfying meal after a day of wine tasting!<//review><response>None< /response>< date>

Never had a bad experience here. The food is fresh and the staff is friendly. This particular location has a full time dining room person - Dave - who goes out of his way to make sure you have a great experience. The only downside is the parking, which can be stressful during busy hours; it seems that all In-N-Out burgers have the smallest parking lots.<//text>

They really shouldn’t be calling names all at once having multiple groups and families bundled up just to get their drink or food. When I brought this up to an employee she responded with “I’m just doing my job”. It’s obvious they get zero training other than using a cashier or making a burger. Plus this same day, they conveniently forgot my animal fries. Loosing money is not cool and management needs to be on the floor.<//review>

This location killed it! Food was nice and fresh. I ordered a double double anima style and they nailed it. The line was wrapped around the corner but well worth it! This location was prompt, clean, workers were polite.

Parking: plenty unless super packed.

Food: hot, fresh, and got my order right the first time.

<Text>I'm a Tampa girl so this was my 1st time having In-N-Out. My bf who used to live in Petaluma raves about it. The service was quick and the food was hot. The burger is a cross bedwetting a big Mac, having something similar to Mac sauce on it, and a double whopper since it had lettuce, tomato & onion on it. The burger was delicious! I'm not really a fan of their fries though, so I gave 4 stars instead of 5.</Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOsn36MGE29oQf1HGzFFkVRp77tJ4fQfwjY7DLw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures><resp>None< /resp><GmapID>0x8084388c86efee91:0x8c755c5baeb27781< /GmapID></record>

The first time I had In N Out I was 11 years old. It was in 1969 at the drive thru on Arrow Hwy. in San Dimas, CA. The only other location was in Baldwin Park, CA.
I moved to Northern California in 1980. Really missed those great burgers!!
In the early 90s I heard In N Out was expanding to Nor Cal. I couldn't wait! Would it be the same?
I wasn't disappointed! Same great burgers, same menu, the only difference was that you could eat inside. The original locations were drive thru only.
I have had In N Out countless times over the years, but every single time I chomp into one I'm back to 1969. Sitting in a Plymouth station wagon with my brothers, sister and Mom and Dad, stomach growling, waiting for our turn at that drive thru window.

You guys are the BEST!!</Review>

Best hamburger. Not too big, not too small. Perfect size and there's always options for those who like more than just 1 patty. Can't wait to go back.< /Text>

When I want a burger, I usually opt for a grass-fed one. BUT every now and then I get a craving for an In-N-Out burger.  They ARE pretty tasty 🙂.  I prefer to order inside; it's quicker and then I can eat at one of the sanitized outdoor tables. I must say that the"crew" are ALWAYS smiling and friendiy.</text>

<Rate>5</Rate><text>Fast, family friendly, clean fast food, and a California classic. Fresh quality ingredients make these simple burgers truly delicious and always fresh cut fries just taste better. I love em animal style and there's a lot to try on the not so secret menu like the protein style burger. When you just need a really good simple burger nothing beats In-N-Out.</text><time>1596669472567<//time>< Pictures>

Not as good as the one in Rohnert Park. The drive up line was totally messed up with two separate lines trying to merge. Need better traffic control. We went inside to order.  Burgers cold.  Did not order onions but they appeared on the Burgers anyway. Disappointed.<//text>

Simple, fresh, incredibly satisfying. These burgers rule. Try them “animal style .” Though the line to order was long, it went pretty quick. Worth the wait!!</Review>

<Review>Always incredible and fresh! Not only do I, as a Californian, love it, but my British husband is now totally on board. He wasn't to sure the first time he tried it but it's grown on him and he even has a custom order now with chopped chilies, pickles, and whole grilled onion with well done fries! I get a double double with cheese and whole grilled onion only with light well fries. If you think I'm picky because I only get cheese and onion on my burger, then you're wrong. I could get salad on my burger, but you try it once without the lettuce and tomato and tell me it's not a deliciously different experience. I've also realized I love eating here more than almost anywhere else. After eating at a restaurant I think, I could have got in n out for less money and enjoyed it more! Also, the fries people like to hate on, are REAL fries. People just aren't used to what non-frozen fried potatoes taste like.</Review>< Pictures>

I'm not your typical Californian. I don't swoon at the thought of In and Out. But my hubby loves it. We go once in a great while. We live hours away from one, so since we were in Santa Rosa, I thought we'd have this for dinner.

At almost 8 PM on A Wednesday, it was a typical In and Out experience. Line around the building, out into the road. There must have been 30 cars at least, in front of us. I was convinced we would be there an hour.

The line moved surprisingly fast. We were literally in and out. Haha. Maybe 15 minutes to get through. There was a guy out there taking orders, so it would be ready when you got there.

I got the double double animal style. Yum! Extra everything. With grilled onions. It was delish. Actually better than I remember. I got animal fries, which has sauce, grilled onion and cheese. So good! And a large coke.

Hubby got a double single. (Double meat, single cheese). With regular fries, and a root beer. We scarfed it down. It was pretty darn good.

We asked for no tomato on my hubbys, because if he eats any seeds, it can make him really sick. But, they put tomato. We also asked for a handful of sauce packets. The guy handed us one. Haha. They must take it out of his pay or something.

It was a great meal. Yummy.</text>

I was there a couple of weeks ago with my girlfriend & we were in line waiting in the drive thru to get our food. The cashier at the first window’s name was Tony. He was one cool guy. He was very respectful to me and my girlfriend and I don’t live in Santa Rosa my girlfriend does. We went here to go eat dinner. I called In N Out & made a good complaint I hope Tony got the message. I’ll for sure will be coming back here again.</review>

<text>Always busy, I like it that they provide jobs for young people, the food is always fresh (has not been sitting under a heat lamp for ?) and the prices are lower than other chains who spend on ads/promotions. A tasty burger, fries, cola can't be beat. Easy freeway access, close to center of town, late hours, always clean. I shop other burger chain stores occasionally but they don't have the consistency of I & O. Yum!</text><user>111466936193233333214<//user>< Rate>

<Review>I ordered a meal here today around 6pm and by the time it was handed to me the fries were cold, not just barely warm but actually cold. My cheese burger was cooked well but the bun was also cold to the touch. I've been here many times and have never had any complaints so I'm hoping this is an isolated incident. I will be going to the Rohnert Park drive through next time. Disappointed in this meal. On a positive note the staff was friendly as always.< /Review><Time>1597301923393<//Time><pictures>None</pictures></record></dataset><record>

<Review>I thought I hated In-N-Out Burger, but then I went to this one and have been back several times since. It's always delicious.

This was my first visit to an In-N-out Burger, I heard from Swedish friends they have the best burgers.
But the place was packed with people, such long lines, no where to sit, long wait for the food, the shouting in the speakers from the staff was very disturbing. So even if the cheeseburger and milkshake was very good, all the other things drag the review down.<//text>

< Review>
If I want a decent, quick inexpensive lunch, this is where I go. If you've never been to an In-N-Out, and you aren't looking for a "gourmet" burger, give it a try. The menu is limited to burgers (you can get a grilled cheese), fries and shakes, BUT they have perfected what they sell. My other main reason for liking In-N-Out is that the employees are always smiling. VERY family friendly.< /Review>

< review>
As a child I once lived in Baldwin Park in S. Calif. also home of the 1st "In and Out Burger". When we moved, part of our annual trip in the summer to visit family that we made "In and Out"  became part of that visits ritual. I was so happy to see that upon its success and growth they made it North and even further... Las Vegas and ..? Definately a Burger worth making part of your familys life, with its quality as well as affordability .<//review>

Generic review, as opposed to location specific, as in my opinion, in-n-out have done a good job of providing exactly the same experience wherever you go. If you have never heard of in-n-out....they are a burger joint. Freshly cooked, high volume, high throughput. Famous for their basic no frills menu and their extensive a la carte "secret menu" that everyone knows about. IMHO, good burgers.< /Review>

<response>None< /response><text>One of the worst experiences at an in n out I have ever had. First off.. we ordered our food from the drive thru (we had no mask on). We got to the cash window (no mask) and once we got to the food window the employee I think his name was Zac said it so rude. “Put your mask on” and while the window was still open was talking rudely about us and cussing and everything. I understand it is a law but when we have gone to all the locations in this county and not once have been told to put on our mask in their drive thru and it’s 11pm at night after just spending 7 hours in the emergency room for pregnancy pains. I have never ever been treated so poorly there.  I WILL NOT BE BACK.</text></record></dataset><record>

The only issue is that people (the employees) keep talking about politics.< /text>

Way too crowded.  The burgers are great and at a good value but not worth the wait and noise. The bathrooms are spacious, updated, and clean and there's plenty of parking. The drive thru is almost always crowded with the line out to the street but, due to the location of the restaurant, it doesn't impede on traffic or cause too many traffic safety issues as does some other In-N-Out locations. Recently, there has been a security guard patrolling the parking lot. Not sure why but it kinda causes some concern as to the safety of the patrons if there is a need for security.</Review>

Its fine it's burgers and fries. The Patty was super salty during my recent visit. But I asked for the fries well done and they were perfectly crispy!!<//text>

If you must do fast food, In-n-Out is the place to go. This location is busy like the others. Quick service though. Wait times no more than 5-10 minutes.</text>

<Text>Im from the south and this was my first time trying In-N-Out, I wasnt honestly impressed. I thought the food was decent but didnt warrant all the hype ive heard for years. Maybe I just tried the wrong location? Will definitely be open to trying agin though to make sure this wasnt a fluke experience.</Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMvV25B-V1nCdCXRQ_O5g92eViERCoxx06K4PZa=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM1fC6a0isP8S0M5bhA4sjGtPeSqJcoELzXt9Jk=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics>< Response>

As a fan of the franchise, I already have a decent idea of how the stores tend to be like. However this one in particular had superb service. Obviously there were long lines and crowded seats, but the one kicker of this location in particular was a certain gentleman who greeted nearly every customer at the door, politely opening the door for guests, walking about the store and cleaning up any messes, making polite compliments, and asking guests how their experience is so far, like a more formal restaurant. This alone made the experience absolutely exquisite for an In N Out experience. Highly recommend visiting this store in particular, hopefully so you too may meet the fine gentlemen I met.</Text>

In N Out has a very simple formula and they stick with it: clean, bright atmosphere, two or three things to eat cooked exactly to expectations, and great milkshakes! Perfection! And they ALL seem to be equally perfect!<//text>

Tomato wrap is the new protein style. It can be messy but it is tasty. Try this order:

- Mustard fried (patty)
- Whole grill (onion)
- Bun extra toast or tomato wrap in lieu of bun

Enjoy!<//review>

I mean, this is in n out. They don’t have bad burgers! Dining time is definitely need to wait, parking sometime is little bit of a headache. If you prefer walk in to order in a busy time. Is possible to find some street parking across the street. Drive though in peak hour will be a long line. But normally drive through is always faster.< /Review>

First timer from the East coast. You guys have something here. A really good fast food burger with excellent service. We were in Santa Rosa California at lunch hour. The place was so hammered, we almost didn't stop. Lines at the counter moved fast, but I wasn't rushed when my turn came. During my short wait I got the best treat....watching the behind the counter/kitchen performance. Well trained and executed. An older employee, David, was wandering the eat in area, checking on customers, offering pickles, and engaging in friendly conversation when a customer seemed open to it. 35 minutes to get in-N-out during lunch. A very good value for the area as well. If all of your stores operate this way, we'll be seeing you soon.</text>

<text>Great food! The reason I'm not giving it another star is because most of the time, THE LINES ARE LONG AS FRICK. I got lucky and got no line the day I came. The inside of the place is cool. I definitely recommend this place if you're looking for an *iconic* burger</text>< pics>

Loooooooong lines as usual,  but obviously well worth the wait, otherwise the lines wouldn't go on for days.  The grilled cheese is awesome for vegetarians, and you can order a patty on the side with no sodium for your K9 friend...my dog KNOWS the smell of In-n-out means shes having her own burger soon!!< /text>

<Review>West Coast classic. My go-to order: double-double animal style, french fries, and a neapolitan shake. You will not find tastier fast* food with friendly service for less than at In-n-Out.

* In-n-Out is definitely not the fastest of fast food. Get ready for a wait when busy, which is pretty much always.</Review><userid>109402057036578263005< /userid>< time>

<text>Despite being busy and it being lunch time, the clerk was very friendly and accommodating of my dietary restriction (gluten allergy). The food was great, we found seating outside, and someone came by our table to ask if we needed anything! Parking can be tight, I recommend parking on the street next to the administration center in the industrial park. Do not park in the parking lots -- they will tow you.</text>< date>

<Response>None< /Response><Text>I am from Ohio, and was excited to try this legendary place.

The burgers were not all that special to me, even animal style. Too much lettuce and not much flavor.

Their animal fries are amazing!

The parking is mostly a nightmare

I prefer a burger from Five Guys but not their fries. The wait at Five Guys is better and so are the burgers, but their fries don't compare. It depends which you like better.</Text>< Gmap_id>

<text>Huh...???  Why tell others when EVERYBODY already knows what a Fantastically YUMMY place this is!
I mean, as packed with customers as In & Out ALWAYS is, that would be like "Cut'n My Nose To Spite My Face," wouldn't it?
The employees ARE Friendly, Silly & quite Professional at the same time. Always a pleasure to watch a "Winning Team" in action.
Thank you ALL, (BOTH Locations)

Fantastic burger. Great fries. Love the Bible verses on the wrapping of the burger and the fry and drink container. Long lines, but totally worth it! Great team of people pumping out the burgers and fries!!<//Text>

Always a classic. I love that they have a non-burger option available, the grilled cheese is amazing. For a simple menu, there’s still a lot to choose from. Wait times are consistent with other locations, always long at peak times but the food is worth the wait.< /text>

In-N-out burger is honestly the best chain fast food restaurant. The fries are perfect and have just the right amount of salt. Also, unlike Burger King, the paddies are not just frozen paddies or packaged cheese.</Review>

Great prices and friendly staff that's open late. The food tastes pretty fresh. You can watch them cut the fries. While a good establishment I find this place very overrated. They don't offer a large variety of food options. Unless you order any of your food "animal style" it really  has no taste. The fries need better oil and some salt. The burger patties are pretty bland. You also usually have to wait up to 30 mins in the drive thru line. Not really worth the wait.< /Text>

Visiting from Denver and we had to make a pit stop here of course. Place was clean and the food was good. Not many 5 star reviews came out of our trip but this one definitely made the cut.< /review>

When the inside is closed due to the pandemic and the guy taking orders in the drive thru cause the lines backed up to the street on a hot day starts to walk back inside tells you "no i can't get you a cup of water" when askes politely but then walks out almost immediately after going in holding a cup of water just to drink it in front you</Review>

< review>
Visiting some of my family here and they decided to “treat” me to the In and Out. David (who works at the I&O) greeted us at the door and made sure my 89 year old mother got the best and closest table. He was so great and really made the visit. I was treated to animal fries (very different and definitely delicious) and a big juicy cheeseburger all the way.
A simple menu makes it easy to quickly decide what to order. Not wordy and complicated like those other places.
It’s no wonder why the I&O is such a great success...great food, smiling people working there, and a menu that’s just a little different from all the other places.
It’s one of those places you can go to five times a month and never get tired of the food.
Five stars every day for this place.

<Review>It's probably the best fast food chain burger. It's just a very tasty burger. Gordan Ramsay likes em and he seems pretty selective. I used to hate the fries but they grow on you. They cut em up and make em fresh right in front of you and you can really taste the potato. They taste like they were alive at some point which is more than I can say about other burger places. If you've never been you should really go at least once, just to see what the fuss is all about.</Review><date>1519797272510</date><Resp>None<//Resp>< pictures>

<Review>Definitely the best quality of a fast food place, if you can really call it that. It's got a drive through but, while it isn't exactly slow, it's definitely not fast. The service is great too, always very friendly and they know all the orders so they are good at managing alterations to the standards. Even without that they'd still absolutely be worth the wait just for the burgers they have :)<//Review>< Gmap_id>

<Review>I'd like to know who doesn't like In-N-Out? Vegetarian/Vegans don't count.  I'm talking to the meat people. Whether you're a health nut (don't get fries and opt for a bun-less burger with "Protein Style") or a Quarter pounder freak (grab a "Double Double", Triple Triple, or whatever number your heart desires) In-N-Out burger will do you right.

Animal style adds mustard, diced grilled onions, and pickles onto your burger or fries (sans pickles/mustard) while grilled cheese sandwiches, protein style burgers and I'm sure others don't quite make the menu.  Some secrets have to remain, but who says you can't have it "your way" at this burger joint?</Review>< Gmap_id>

<Name>Amber Sheridan</Name><Review>It is In N out. What can you say? The food is consistent, the people are unfailingly friendly. They have no issue qith changing every last item for your food allergies, prefrences or because you like some freaky combination of tasty fast food. It is busy because they are all busy. But the food is fresh and you don't wait all that long.< /Review>< Rating>

A great place for a burger.  You should always order it animal style.  "In-N-Out Burger is an American regional chain of fast food restaurants with locations primarily in the Southwest and the Pacific coast.[3] It was founded in Baldwin Park, California, in 1948 by Harry Snyder and Esther Snyder. The chain is currently headquartered in Irvine, California and has expanded outside Southern California into the rest of California, as well as into Arizona, Nevada, Utah, Texas, and Oregon. The current owner is Lynsi Snyder, the Snyders' only grandchild."  Wikipedia 2019</Text>

Good shakes and fries to die for. Burgers are okay, I liked the lettuce wrapped burger. But they seem kinda small and thin. I'll always love In-N-Out just because it's a Californian staple tho.<//Review>

<review>The drive-through line is always long, winding like a snake through the parking lot, and sometimes backed out onto the street. But fear not, they are very, very quick. My go-to order: cheeseburger animal style, regular fries, Neapolitan shake. The best. I have to limit myself to one visit a week, which is hard because I work in the area.</review>< Rating>

My favorite fast food yet!!!   It's soooooooo busy it's not in and out, but find a parking spot, wait in line to place your order, and find a seat.  That's the fast part.  Then you wait 5 (if you're lucky) to 20 minutes waiting for your delicious double double with fries and vanilla milkshake to arrive.  When it finally arrives your in heaven!!! The quality and price are amazing!!!  When you leave it's a breeze!!  Is the 10 minute to 30 minute wait worth it?? Yes!!!<//review>

In-N-Out .... great place though has lost it's truly legendary status with expansion. I love the cheeseburger and the many off-menu options. And the best of all: fries that taste like potatoes becuase they are made from potatoes.< /text>

Love this place. The line was so long it wrapped around the building for the drive through. Only took about 15 minutes to get almost 20 burgers for the work crew. Super fast and delicious. Very friendly staff.<//Review>

I can't remember why I used to like this burgers, the fries were soggy and tasteless the same as my burger, I had a completely different image of In-N-Out, I don't know if they changed or it was me but I didn't like it at all.< /text>

After a full day if traveling and not having In-N-Out for some time, this was the very first place I went to after I got my vehicle. Food was very good as always. The line was extremely long, but that's just part of the experience.< /text>

<Review>If you've been to an In-N-Out burger before, this location is exactly like most other locations. Same layout, same hats, same food, same beverages, not as much parking as you want, and many more people inside than the parking seemed to suggest.

If you haven't been to In-N-Out before, then you may as well try it here since everybody raves about it in California, and if you don't go now, somebody will probably want to take you later. The food tastes more fresh than most fast food places (some of my friends would probably get angry for me just calling it fast food), but it's not like insanely good. The prices are reasonable, the shakes are good (vanilla is bae), and the fries are good. I like to eat a pepper with my burger, but the peppers are spicy so be warned. The lemonade here is sweet, but it tastes good as well.

If you're a tourist, may as well ask them at the front for one of those hats as well. Or get it for the kids.

Why 5-star if I think it's so overrated? People talk about it like it's a 7/5, but really, it's just good fast food. I rate it 5/5 for fast food, not for some fancy anniversary dinner.</Review><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

Just be cautious about when you come in. If it during rush hours or after work times (4 to 7 pm workdays) expect rhe drive thru to be a +45 min wait. At that point you might as well go inside. The drive thru can circle all the way around and to the street 😂😂 honestly it is just a testimony how great this place is. Regular diet cheat day.< /review>< pics>

<pics>None< /pics><Name>K M< /Name><Text>Of course they're awesome. Usually long lines, drive thru line sometimes complicates parking. Outdoor seating. Next to gas station on corner. There are off menu items, in case you haven't heard, like "animal style". Also Atkins lettuce burger, tell them gluten allergy and they'll accommodate your order.<//Text><GmapID>0x8084388c86efee91:0x8c755c5baeb27781</GmapID>< Rate>

Always a good time, the guys taking orders for the drive thru need a raise, very professional. A homeless man yelled at our guy while he was taking our order, but he still repeated the order back flawlessly. Impressive considering it was an order for 4 people with all their various preferences.< /Review>

It's a good burger, that's for sure. The fries were a little salty for my taste. My meal price was extremely reasonable and the people were polite. However, the 20 min wait in drive-thru isn't worth it.<//Review>

I am an east coast man primarily but while I travel alot I have never been to an in n out. With that said, I'll never go to another. I do not see what the hype is all about. 5 guys has them beat hands down. The french fries are wierd almost like the texture of pringles which I've always wondered if they're even real potatoes. The burger was fine but nothing to write to your mother about. My wife didnt even eat most of her food. Dont waste your money.< /review>

Can you go wrong with In-n-Out? The answer is no. Eat inside and beat the drive-thru lines.< /text>

I live in orcutt and I'm a volunteer SAR member. Unfortunately they forgot my remaining items to my order due to the fact that I was being called out. Unfortunately when I came back around to retrieve the rest of my order they ignore my presence and continue on. As a loyal customer this was a shock!< /review>

Great that a young man takes the orders outside so our food is expedited, but if your going to require someone to stand outside in cold weathet to take orders,  the least you could provide is an outside heater.<//text>

<Text>Trash service. Completely made my burgers wrong as if they just handed me some random premade burgers. Guess I’ll wait for the MAIL for a refund. What an absolute joke. Your burgers don’t compare to a real burger place like SWENSONS<//Text>< username>

<time>1547351176978< /time><Rating>5<//Rating><review>I love In-N-Out!!!! Their hamburger patties have some substance and taste fresh and all the toppings make for a delicious burger. In the past I have not been impressed with fries at other locations which were limp amd soggy despite being made from fresh cut potatoes. But this location has it down! Delicious crispy fries! The shakes are nothing exciting (I grew up on Burgerville milkshakes, sorry). There is also a secret menu which I rarely order from but I'm sure you could Google. I do know you can ask for grilled onions on your burger and I have tried the "Animal Style" fries which are pretty good (smothered in fry sauce and grilled onions). Plan ahead for a bit of a wait. There's usually a line at the drive thru and a slightly shorter line inside.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None</resp>< gmapID>

This place is on FIRE! Every time we go there, no matter what time of day it is, this place is PACKED. Their burgers are so grubbin' and the prices are so reasonable,  it is worth the wait! I can see why this girl (the owner) is in the top 5 richest in the world!!< /Review>

<Review>This gets a 4.9.  They could earn a 5 if they would only find a way to get rid of the lines.  Nevertheless, the lines indicate the popularity of the food.  You always know what you will get here.  Of course, one can't forget to mention the real ice cream milkshakes.  I better head to In N Out right now...</Review></record></dataset><record>

What can I say, it's In-n-Out, awesome burgers your way all the time. Go with my favorite, double double with Animal fries and an Arnold Palmer with a slice of lemon. For fun get yourself a grilled cheese with onions and pickels.< /text>

I bought every solid thing they had, but found a distinct lack of poutine lol. In-N-out, get on this! You've got all the ingredients lying around and it's hella good. Make it a month long Canadian special or something to try it out.</Review>

<review>What can I say? Consistent In-n-out resto. Friendly, helpful staff, limited menu made with good quality ingredients. The entrance is hidden, very frustrating, but even worse is the horror of a parking lot that is confusing, always full, and hard to turn around in, especially if there are a lot of truck-nut style pickups in the lot.  But I love the friendly, helpful service, freshness and consistentcy. Good for late nights rather than lunch due to parking frustration.</review>< Rate>

Single patty cheese burger is a B+.. Protein style cheese burger is a solid B, and a burger with out cheese i would never eat so i can't speak to that.< /review>< pics>

<text>If you don't know what In-N-Out Burger is, a trip to one of their stores should be the next thing you do. Just stop what you're doing and go get a Double Double, because whatever other Hamburgers you have been eating (with a few exceptions) were full-stop worse that what you can get here.

This store is just as nice as any other In-N-Out. The service is generally quite fast except at peak evening hours.< /text></record>

Who doesn't know In-N-Out Burger? Simply one of the best fast food burgers.
Ask for grilled onions, or Animal Style. They have a secret menu.</review>

I asked for a plain cheeseburger with pickles and o got a cheeseburger without pickles. In addition I got pickles on my 4 x 4 with anions on both burgers and we clearly said we both do not like onions. I asked for chilies and I got a bunch of ketchup and mustard like seriously🤨<//Text>

Service was good,but the buns of our burgers was soggy but it could have been the extra pickles too. It was fun for the kids to feed the pigeons out side with the food we did not want to eat.< /Text>

What's not to say? This iconic chain burger joint is always a crowd pleaser. Always go animal on the burgers. If you've never had animal fries, now's the time to try them. Their shakes are pretty decent. My favorite is the neopolitan shake. All three flavors in one shake. Enjoy!<//Review>

No real gluten free menu items except for using lettuce instead of a bun.
I wish they would get with it.</Review>

The design of the parking lot does not meet the demand of the customers. The drive through needs to be routed a different way; the people in the drive through are blocking people from leaving the parking lot.</review>

<review>What can be said? It's In-n-out and it's the best!
The parking can be a little cramped at busy times, so you will have to park across the street, but the short walk is well worth.
You can expect a relative wait time depending on what time of day it is, but that is because every other person in town is coming here for lunch or dinner.< /review>< time>

Delicious burger was amazing the sauce they have couldn't get enough, French fries could of been better but bland and not cooked right but overall definitely a place to go when your craving for some meat in between two buns</text>

Im not a fan of in and out. Lets get that out of the way. I don't see what the hype is all about. They have average food like any other fast food joint. If the food is so good then why are they just a regional restaurant?</Text>

One of the few last remaining chains that hasn't gone megagodzilla on us and our environment. The food is better than most fast food venues and the help is as scrumptious as the meal - stellar service and great prices.</text>

<review>While food and staff are great trying to enter and exit the parking lot is a nightmare. The restaurant draws crowds larger than it can handle and the adjacent areas are littered with trash from their drive through. I wish they would redesign their entrance and exit not having the dive through line snake through the parking lot effectively blocking access to restaurant.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

Fresh ingredients, quick service, cheap prices. Can't come out west without an In-n-out trip.< /text>< Date>

Always busy, parking is limited, especially because of the way the drive-thru and street traffic is structured. Noisy, crowded interior that is about 80% college and high school students, but usually everyone is friendly. The food is worth it, value and taste wise. Just go already.<//Review>

15 cars in the drive thru and a full parking lot everyday. It took me longer to pull out of my space than it took to get the burger that was luke warm by time I could eat it. Waste of your time if you ask me< /Text>

I got food poisoning from their store ..I called to let them know and they didn't seem to care didn't really want to do anything about it. I was very disappointed in them considering I'm a long time customer and loved eating there now im afraid too< /review>

The only problem is their popularity!  It doesn't matter how early or late you go, be prepared for a 15 to 30 minute wait!<//text>

This is the busiest In N Out I've ever seen since it's the most northern one on Hwy 101.  At 9pm, the parking lot is full and drive through line stretches all the way past the gas station.<//Text>

I CAN eat these hamburgers without any problems.Prices are unbelievable,
From $2.30 to $3.75 for one hamburger,
Coffee is only $1.25 served in a large cup and it is delicious.<//review>< name>

(Translated by Google) It is in my opinion the best burger, I love the taste. Another detail that I like is that they are well organized to be able to attend us as quickly as possible due to the drive-thru and the attitude of the people who work there is very good.
