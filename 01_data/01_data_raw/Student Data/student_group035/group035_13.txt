Amazing. One of the better shawarmas in the city. It’s filling without feeling to full and bloated. Everything tastes fresh. They’re not lying about making everything one by one.

Note: The hours are a bit strange here. Based on a yelp review, the own and the land lord have some beef.</text>

My God! I am not a "sandwich" lover, but this was the best darn sandwich! Tunisian tuna with fantastic baguette (perfectly soft on the inside and crunchy on the out). The Moroccan mint tea was expertly steeped with just the right sweetness. Yum 😋!</Text>

<Text>I took my friend here on a whim, never eaten here before but it was close to his hotel.  I highly recommend the house tea which is served sweetened.  I order the chicken special which was awesome.  My daughter wanted the soup but I wasn't sure if she would like it, the owner offered her a sample cup on the house.  It was almost a full order.  She asked for seconds and he brought her an even larger bowl and didn't even charge for the first.  After we finished our dinner, the owner gave us a free desert to try.  Also very yummy and rich.  It rare to have this type of mom and pop service in the City any more and for them to offer samplings just to see the enjoyment of their cuisine.< /Text></record>

<review>We stopped by here while visiting SF. This is not a review for the food as we didn't get a chance to try it. Rather this is a review for the lack of respect for the customer. We parked near by and walked to this restaurant. I tried to open the door but it was locked. While checking the other side of the corner to see if there is another door two men unlocked the door talking in their native language one trying to convince the other to allow us to enter. The other one didn't want us to enter for some reason. There was still 2 hours to their closing time. I am guessing it was because the restaurant was full and/or we had 2 small children. I don't know. While they are talking to each other I asked whether they are open. They kept ignoring me and continue their discussion. Soon the guy was convinced and signaled us to enter at which point I was pretty annoyed by the whole ordeal. I thanked them and we walked away. I would totally understand if they addressed me and told me that they are full.< /review>< Rate>

This is one of my favorite places to eat. The food is always great, and at a very good price.

Make sure to call before coming though, because their open hours are very unusual, and tend to be closed for several months at a time.< /review>

Everything we tried was amazing.  Go during late afternoon when it's not crowded as the food can take a little bit but is worth the wait.  I had the lamb kebab couscous and it was simply awesome.  My girlfriend had a chicken shwarma, and the grilled wrap that it comes in makes its perfect.  We also ordered some bread, pita, and hummus, which were all about average....but they also have a roasted red pepper spread/dip that you HAVE to try.  The staff seemed pretty quiet and reserved, and we just started talking to the cook and telling him how much we enjoyed it all.  He seemed appreciative and offered us mint tea and a pistachio dessert. Nice little place, very reasonably priced......and I was completely stuffed when I left.  Even if you know nothing about moroccan cuisine - you'll be just fine.  Just get the lamb or chicken kebabs with couscous and you'll be happy.<//review>

Although the Couscous and Shakshouka Merguez here are good this is NOT authentic Tunisian food whatsoever! The flavors are night and day different from what I ate in Tunisia. Food is expensive, a meal for two is never less than $45. I go here only when I have an extreme craving for couscous.< /text>

were microwaved. Ditto for falafel. Hummus was lame, but the babaganush was edible. Salad had wilted and black bits in it. I don't know who posted the previous positive reviews, but I seriously doubt their credentials. Why 3 stars then instead of two? Because there is potential here if the food was made fresh.</text>

<Text>Stopped by here for Sunday afternoon brunch and the food was delicious. I usually opt for Aicha's Moroccan which is only two blocks away, but I am definitely glad I decided to try something new instead. We ordered the breakfast burrito with merguez added as well as the shakshouka, both of which were delicious. I also ordered the mint tea, which was absolute heaven - fresh, minty, and just the right amount of sweet. Each table also receives an Acme baguette that is served with a delicious harrissa paste.

As someone who eats halal meat only, wherever I travel I usually find myself at Mediterranean type places when I crave meat, and so I've come to develop a rather high standard when it comes to this particular cuisine. I can honestly say that this place has hands down the best merguez I have ever tasted - the lamb was fresh, juicy, and perfectly spiced. I would return here just for the merguez. In fact, I look forward to returning for lunch and dinner and sampling what else they have to offer.

Overall, if you're in the area and are looking for an affordable and delicious meal, you won't go wrong with Cafe Zitouna!</Text>< name>

Cafe Zitouna serves amazing Moroccan food, and they have a very nice family-run feel. The chicken-pie-in-phyllo-dough (B'stilla) is fantastic, of course, but I really like the tajines the best.< /Text>

<Review>Current Hours are:

Tues-Thurs: 11:30am to 9:00pm Fri: 2:00pm to 9:00pm
Sat and Sun: 11:30am to 9:00pm Closed Monday

We stopped into this light and airy corner restaurant for lunch and were amazed at the wonderful flavors of the various "fait maison" dishes served.  We ordered a delicious spread of appetizers, including the Breek (Tunisian crêpe), the Moroccan eggplant and pita, and the perfectly spiced Merguez sausage.  The fresh mint tea (lightly sweetened) was a very refreshing accompaniment to the meal.  Finishing off the lunch was a homemade pudding featuring essence of geranium and topped with ground pistachios.  Excellent end to a perfect lunch.

Within a day, we were back at Café Zitouna this time for dinner.  We ordered the Mosaic of kebabs (lamb, chicken and Merguez) and the lamb stew couscous, both served with a basket of fresh French bread.  Once again, chef was spot on with the dishes.

Unlike many of the city's other restaurants, all of the dishes at Café Zitouna are made in house (including the owner's excellent Harissa sauce).  Both times the welcome we received was warm and genuine.

Thank you for two excellent meals, Chef!  We look forward to our next visit to Café Zitouna.  A bientôt!</Review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None< /resp><gmap_id>0x80858094439acddf:0x698cf43d4c42b19c< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<text>great tasty  north african food .  the couscous is good as well as the lamb sausage and lamb meat. The spicy "Harissa" paste is in-house made weekly. The brika are like fillo dough pastry was amazing.  The "Chackchouka " is a stew like with vegies and meat taste excellent.  A sweet pastry called "harissa" also  is mouth watering.  Prices are real cheap for the quality and quantity of food you get.  NO alcoholic drinks are served. But the green well steeped tea is more than compensate for this .  Go and will go back for sure.  Bon  Appetit</text>< pics>

(Translated by Google) Gosh! I'm not a "sandwich" lover, but this is the best sandwich! Tunisian tuna with fantastic baguettes (completely soft inside and crunchy). Moroccan mint tea is professionally steeped with just the right amount of sweetness. Yum

(Translated by Google) Apparently this restaurant opens and closes when they feel like it, not at the times they post on their site.
Looks like they open and close whenever they want. Not respecting the business hours.

Apparemment ce restaurant ouvre et ferme ses portes quand ils en ont envie, pas aux horaires qu'ils affichent sur leur site.

<review>Beautiful mosaic steps in Sunset area of San Frsncisco. Both sides of the steps have very beautiful a d delightful garden. You can see the view of San Francisco bay and Marina district clearly on the clear day. Upon coming on top of the steps, you can climb up a zigzag stairs up to the top of the hill where the Grand View Park is located. From the Grand View Park you can see everywhere of San Francisco, down town sky line, the Golden Gate park with De Young Museum poking through, the Twin Peaks near by, the Land End etc. It is a very good experience. Best of all, it is usually not very crowded and there are plenty of roadside parking nearby with need to pay for parking.<//review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNrpNWCuzyd7dz-2Bh95elTHiSBPNnhDUkCmx6S=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM7CvH42yPjqO-Jn9Sjz-0kTOgrrehOXfF_4teu=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM7VA6Ixopf68S1wggGLkY3gNSKRDmY8B5RJlIc=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMUwZ9gKIDIJ99HVZ7t-b1k400m_e3md3t3Xnzs=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMYGtex3qj9KpVharSnzVU9XUckWY0JjdVCB6xx=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM6PlVHpV4PcoO3mJDIlHko08K7tt2yCH3m-nY8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMq2VgqN3qMLMvz7SBsOgPnnFKiaqhKFkx7ZE6P=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPyAIOsNAQ1GKoA0_-HwNNm4O_QSlDaFtcI2_7d=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMT8sEQ-wtDBgpWsD_y-G61CyeTZJoIsEMY5q1r=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMgN_v96HxgSWcNiKPcL3Zj_P39Cq4vQWt_41xo=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPUNAfqSgu3NtATvzEsM4lJ79W2f46rOb9nK6hS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNJ1shJfVTRlx33yYuWrrC4X4KyUMBgqoRLOx74=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNctoRU97ghdnDumkDTZwXOoVgMPk_jj1VHFLy8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP2MK_oS2pw0nFfs3iSSG6dHsFvWX0WBAMV7uz3=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOaB3yNjAcK_9D-F-TghWFMPXQ9Iz27Wg6bTN65=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOoB7Y7E8GdAJXI6c_i2tqDX4reYVjkFTCjOL-X=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOzsWYHNkqokVrw8Hj1HL5rHL2ZtOltpnoamzZe=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOfVf5_gVbXably7KLkBwbH3_JWZPJZ74f97kYj=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPMv186LPm5DHuLvgz98Qv95bbfC-bIgYLwQkbu=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNg1MymBB8wTIkOMHFyjpRXCqCZdylB0O76BIcM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures>< Response>

It is a fabulous spot for pictures with the mosaic steps on the stairway.  Walking up and down the steps would be a good exercise for the day.  View from the top let you see the Pacific Ocean.  You will enjoy the great view during sunset.  So get your camera ready.

By the way, bring a jacket since it could be chilly and windy...<//text>

<Text>The staircase is beautiful and the view from it is also exceptional from wherever you stand, whether you’re on the stairs, on top of them or at the base. Neighborhood parking is available, although depending on the time of the day, there might be a lot of people on the stairs.< /Text><user_id>111461044523184372709</user_id>< name>

<Text>I've been here twice. The stairs are pretty. There aren't very many of them, but interesting to see and I wish more stairs were like this elsewhere in cities. There is a spectacular view from the top, almost 360 degrees and see a lot of the city at once. Great for a sunset too. There's another small stair with mosaic nearby too. There's also a bus stop at the bottom, so you can go even if you don't have a car.</Text>< user_name>

<text>The hidden steps start on 16th and Kirkham so don’t miss that part!! There are a LOT more steps than i thought and i think it’s worth it to do all of it. Great view. bring water though. And don’t plan anything to be right after because you might not see it all or you’ll be late for your next thing.<//text><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

Great spot to take in some local sightseeing. Heads up: don't leave your purse or any important belongings in your car. A group is going around breaking into rental vehicles or cars with obvious belongings in them. The neighborhood has posted warning signs, listen to them.</Review>

Don't park here! There are robbers breaking into your car and stealing your stuff. We left for 5 minutes, barely the time to take a picture and the result was: thousand dollar to fix the car, lost our flight, tablet, jewelry, documents, credit cards!! If it were Texas this wouldn't happen. Stay clear, of this trap.< /Review>

Once you get up the first set Mosaic  stairs continue on your far right will be a mid staircase once up those stairs to your far right we'll be another staircase lead you up to the top To Grandview Park where the view will be A Sweeping 360 Scape View . It it is a wonderful way to get some exercise  . To get there take the N Judah To  19th Avenue walk  to Moraga Avenue or take the 28 19th avenue.

<review>(Translated by Google) The design of the stair mosaics is very nice, perfect for taking pictures. In addition, these stands lead to a park that has a very good view of San Francisco. It is worth visiting if one has time to spare in the city, especially to go see the sunset from this place.

El diseño de los mosaicos de la escalera es muy bonito, perfecto para tomar fotos. Además, estas gradas llevan a un parque que tiene muy buena vista de San Francisco. Vale la pena visitarlo si uno tiene tiempo de sobra en la ciudad, especialmente para ir a ver el atardecer desde este lugar.< /review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPiChakpsm0tK2HVfcm6S49iXhGzmuT1u5Dp4oS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMNEUFjFwLeji29KhAEqmS6LNDf_PnkrEl4YxMh=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics>< Response>

Don't even think about eating here! New owners have completely ruined this place. They have erected massive glass screens over the counter area and speak to you through an EXTREMELY LOUD PA system. It is deafening. I have never seen anything like this. The loudness combined with the broken English is almost impossible to understand. Mean, scary, aggressive lady behind the glass. There were three customers in the shop and we waited almost 30 minutes for our orders. We only received our orders after we banded together and demanded our food. The food, if you can call it that, was uneatable. The fish was oily (low temperature cooking) and tainted with a rancid oil taste. The batter, fell off of the fish. I had ordered 3 pieces and threw away 2. The coleslaw tasted of raw fish juice. Disgusting. Threw it away. Stay away, far away from this place. I never write Yelp reviews - consider this review a public service. Minus 4 stars is my rating. Pray that I live through the night.</text>

The food was good and greasy. But when i asked for a couple extra condiments they said yes but never put them in the bag.... That's the second time... They charge for each little condiment you get.. Or don't get.....<//Review>

Greetings, I have enjoyed H.Salt Fish & Chips for many many years. But!!!!!! Today!!!!!!! This was a very disappointing eating experience. The fish & hushpupies were cooked entirely in  OLD OLD OLD oil, the food including the chips were DARK & Ugly. It is my desire to return someday and see they have improved< /Review>

<Review>First time coming and to be honest i dont really think that the close to 25$ i spent was worth it. I had a 2 piece fish and shrimp combo with side of coleslaw and drink.</Review>< pics>

The fish is the bomb!!!
I was there 3weeks ago.
The place is a bit freaky looking inside and out.  I walked in to find all the tables and chairs had tape on them.  Looked like a crime scene but it was obvious no dining was allowed indoors due to COVID.
The lady at the counter addressed me through a cheap loud microphone.  I hadn't been to an H.Salt in over 25 years, the menu was a bit overwhelming but she was patient.
The fish and coleslaw were fresh and delicious OMG!
The fish was a tad too oily but a few napkins solved that. SOOO GOOD!
If you can, definitely call ahead to place your order.  I was the only customer and waited about 30 minutes.< /Text>

<review>My husband stumbled onto this place one day and brought his left overs at home. My daughter made the fish into a sandwich and fell in love. Second time he went back I placed my order for a 4pcs of fish & Chips as well as an order of scallops & Chips (order first/saves you waiting time) both are delicious. I really love their fish here. It's not dry, it's not oily and the best part is, it's still good for a fish sandwich the next day! My family & I buy their fish & Chips atleast once a week now.</review><pictures>None</pictures><response>None< /response><Gmap_id>0x80c2be1fbe6d46a1:0x9620bb95c23fd40</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

You know first off the restaurant is no longer H.Salt Fish & Chips. When I arrived I noticed that the sign on the building they had removed the H Salt and the only thing left was fish and chips. So the restaurant is still a seafood place now. To the food once I ordered and received my food which I ordered the 3-piece fish and chips. I was actually pleasantly surprised by how wonderful and fresh the fish tasted. The batter that they use to fry the fish in was excellent the flavor was phenomenal. I will absolutely go back to this little joint. And I call it a little joint because to me it seemed like it was a little hole-in-the-wall but a great one.</Review>

When I went to the business, I thought it was an H Salt location but when I got there, it is now NoHo Fish & Chips. That being said, the food quality was very good. The batter on the fish was crunchy and lite and not greasy.  The "chips" are French fries but perfectly acceptable. Also got s side of coleslaw which was also nicely done..not too watery. I know businesses are having a tough time during this pandemic and some take shortcuts on preparation but not the case here. Enjoy!<//Text>

I had a terrible experience, after coming for years never again. The owner was severely rude to us, overly trying to sell add ons, and when I returned to ask for utensils she insisted we had them, was very hostile, and even has a sign posted that if she doesn't like your attitude she'll add $10. A guy came in after us, placed his order and was served immediately we had to wait even longer than that! NO.</review>

I had really high expectations for this place, but boy was I in for a treat. When I placed the order , the lady on the phone asked when I was going to be there, and I said in 5-10min, but then she said well it’s going to take 15min. Okay. When I got there, there was a gentleman who took the food from the heater, and served it to me. As I got to my car, I couldn’t wait to eat, and so I tried the fried banana. Looking at the photo, it was burnt, soggy, and old. So, I tried a fry, and it was limp and old too. Bummed, I went back inside and asked for a refund. The same gentleman grabbed the owner or manager. This Asian lady storms out YELLING at me, insanely belligerent demanding that I leave my phone number and that they’ll take care of me later since she was on an important meeting. Calmly, I asked to resolve everything now. She just kept her loud, disrespectful tone repeating what she said. She wasn’t even wearing a mask and she was in the kitchen! Finally, I asked the gentleman to help me. All he did was simply void the transaction. I thanked him and told him I’m sorry for him if he had to deal with that lady as a manager.<//Text>

<Text>This location its just false advertising, first of all its no longer "H.Salt". And on the front window they have that they accept EBT.... Which in fact they don't. Second time we get the same excuse that the system is not working properly for EBT, but this time she stated that they just set it up today about 30 min ago. And that's when me and my bf notice she's lying. They just want customers to come in thinking that this place accepts EBT, then get them to pay cash or credit card. Which this time didn't fall for it and walked away. But Did tell her that's she's false advertising with EBT sign on the window. But didn't respond. We would not recommend to anyone.<//Text><pics>None</pics>< Response>

For fish & chips,  and Other Breaded Seafood Favs this is a good go to.  A bit pricey and the location isn't the best.  But Friendly Owner and Worker's.< /Text>

<review>I had not been to an H Salt in many, many years. After today's experience, I will never go again. They have turned into nothing but little grease balls. Barely any fish, mostly deep-fried batter that wasn't even drained. Too much grease for me. The one star is only because the people inside were extremely nice and accommodating.< /review>< date>

<text>Classic H. Salt just like i remember it from years back. This location was awesome, super friendly and accomodating and the place is spotless, i dont know how they can keep a restaurant featuring a fryer so clean, great job! Fish wasn't the triangle shape I expected and this caused a bit of worry. But it was every bit as good. Light and crunchy with an excellent crisp. Beverages are cans and bottles and they have all the condiments you'd expect including, tartar sauce and malt vinegar for your fries.<//text><gmap_id>0x80c2be1fbe6d46a1:0x9620bb95c23fd40</gmap_id>< date>

Under new management and she is the WORST! The prices seem to be higher, she charges for condiments and she asks for tips
I've been coming here for several years and it WAS really good. Now, it seems that this new lady has run all the customers away! I was just there on Saturday and I think that will be my last time coming. Sad...cause I like the jumbo shrimp.<//review>

This is a MOST horrible business and horrible owner who refuse to pay employees salary. The lady who work in the store is actually the owner of the business and do not even understand that it is illegal to refuse to pay for employee’s salary.
BTW: They have a lot of cockroaches on the floor in the back of the prep area. :)< /Review>

I ordered the fish and chips through postmates. What a waste of $26.00! The fish was soggy, had no flavor and tasted like it was fried in old grease.
The fries were not fresh.  They were hard, nearly burnt and tasted as if they were cooked in old grease. I will never order from this place again.< /Review>

First the lady that took my order was rude n when asked if I wanted to pay a tip I said no. Probably a mistake.There were 3 customers that came after me with several minutes in between. It took almost 25 min for my food to be ready but the rest of the customers got it right after me. My food was horrible specially the fish. I bit into oil n my fish was mooshie, not sure if overcooked or she just let it sit in oil for getting no tip. Everybody’s food looked better than mine. It hasn’t been my first time there but it will be my last! I felt discriminated against! Lastly she told everyone to order ahead to avoid a wait except to me!! This ruined my day! I never do this but here it is! The truth!!<//text>

It took 20 minutes to make our food. Extra charge for tartar sauce and all they serve is fish/ seafood! This place used to be excellent. Never again.

Check receipts THEY SCAM PEOPLE!

I just ordered food from this establishment. The manager wasn't on time to HER OWN BUSINESS?! While I was trying to pay she was yelling over the phone to the back of the house cook Donovan (who was an angel) He did everything right and was very kind, UNLIKE the new manager. She told him over the phone to not allow me the paying customer to assist Donovan out with transaction.
We waited a while for the food, which wasn't a big deal but as we arrived home to finally eat our food, the jumbo shrimp was missing from our ordered. We called the manager and told her the shrimp was missing, she immediately was defensive and said maybe our dogs ate the shrimp?! What?
She then called us on videochat by our private number after we told her our order was incorrect and proceeded to harass us even more. (Which is highly unprofessional.)</text>

First time in this place, have eaten in west LA before. I came here an was immediately taken advantage of. Was charged 16.95 for what I thought was a 3 piece. Then the lady says she would’ve given a fourth piece when I order a 3 piece. Then when I caught her she got angry. I’m never coming to this location again. We will see how the Reseda one is<//review>

<Review>I only gave 1 star because you cannot go any lower.  First, she gave us a bill for $59, when I questioned it, she said it was correct! When I started adding things up verbally, she looked at the receipt and said she had made a mistake. Then she tried to get my husband to sign the receipt and said she would refund us the excess in cash. I insisted on her voiding it and giving me a correct receipt. Again, all I got was the credit card receipt, when I asked for a detail slip, she said, that was it! I insisted on a detail slip which she eventually gave me with the food.  Despite being told this was the orig H Salt and her family was 4th generation owners and the batter that they used was the same, did not believe it.  We ordered 4 pieces of fish and various sides, everything came back over fried to the point of being burnt and dripping in oil. Out of the 4 pieces of fish, only one was somewhat edible, the others were batter shells with barely any fish in them! The hushpuppies were so hard, my husband bounced it on the table. I wish I had taken photos! We left most of the food on the table and just walked out.</Review>< pictures>

Yes please!  One of only a few remaining locations...but sooo good when you crave everything battered and deep fried.  Always served fresh and hot.  Gotta have the deep fried mushrooms.  Very small, but never a wait.< /review>

Great customer service. But the food was too expensive and terrible. They probably use there cooking oil for about a year now. I will be embarrass to be the cook over there and the owner over there.  I will never go over there again. Please save your money and time!</text>

The gentleman who helped was very courteous and polite. The food is as good as the H. and Salt I’ve come to love even though the fish is actually on the bland side the tartar sauce makes up for it lol. That’s the way I see it at least.<//review>

<Rate>1< /Rate><text>I was craving some fish and chips and was excited to see this place. However,when I walked in, I could hear the fish frying and could tell the oil wasn't hot enough. This explains why the fish was WAY too oily. The fries tasted old although I had just watched the guy cook them.

just can't go wrong with fish and chips. This place has been around forever the prices are getting a little higher however it still seems a good value. They've expanded their menu and have some other things on it besides Just Fish and Chips but fish and chips is my go-to and a side order of coated and fried sweet potato slices< /Text>

Their sanitation and the way they preserved the food is risky for your health.

<text>Used to get carry-out lunch there sometimes when I worked in Tower Burbank last year.  Always enjoyed the good old-fashioned fish & chips and hush puppies, etc.  Unfortunately the place had been modernized and already lost much of its original character, and not long after it closed for even more remodeling.  Not sure if it's reopened since.  Good for carry-out fish & chips when in the area, but I like the other store in Hollywood over by Hollywood and Vermont better as it has not been modernized and still has it's original 1970s look inside.< /text>< resp>

Ordered light batter and there was so much batter you could hardly see the fish. You certainly could not taste it. I could have wrung out the grease and filled a cup. Not to mention the grease clearly had not been changed well beyond its intended lifespan.

Do yourself a favor and stick with the freezer section at your local grocer for fish. It would well exceed this location on its very best day. A total waste of money, buyer beware!</Text>

Place was very dated and dingy.  Only 1 person working, and it took some time to get mediocre food.</text>

Waited 40 mins for my food and it was nasty af. I got a fresh batch (hoped so considering the wait) and you could see the frying oil on the plate from the fish. The frying oil was so dark Im positive they haven't changed it in at least a month.< /review>

This is a small location that has been here for years and the reason why is because the food is amazing and the fish does not make me sick. I like the old fashion aspect of the location with outdoor seating and the whole place is just cute.</Review>

I guess I don't really like Fish & Chips. It was very oily even though it was freshly prepared. And it took 10 minutes to prepare food that was kind of bland.<//review>

I am never coming here again. This was place I grew up for years going to with my parents. The hubs and I decided to come and her dinner for the 1st day of lent for us and our kids and spent $80.
This place was HORRIBLE.

1st they had someone who didn't know the menu to well and we got charged for extra things we didn't order. Told the manager and it wasn't fixed.

2nd it took them what they told us would be 15 min.s to have the food ready, took them nearly an hour. And to make matters worse, they were serving others while they were working on ours. And so by the time we got our food it was already cold.

3rd the food tasted HORRIBLE. It was either over cooked or burnt. None of us was able to enjoy any of the food. I was so mad that we wasted $80 on food that had to be trashed.

I will never coming here again.</text>

This place has been there for like 30 years.  I remember going there as a young kid.  They added more items to the menu.  Freshly cooked to order.  My favorite are Chicken strips (delicious with Vinegar), Oysters, hush puppies, and fried sweet potatos.< /Review>

I LOVE H SALT FISH & CHIPS! I've been going here since I was a child. It's been in the same location forever! The owner Jason keeps the restaurant clean, and ran by valued employees. The food is terrific, always fresh, and usually not very greasy, even though it is fried. I love their Combo plate 1 - 2 pc of Shrimp, 1 pc of Fish, and Fries under $10! Great location right on Lankershim, and Camarillo in North Hollywood. You can sit inside, or outside. Across the street is Jersey Mikes, a new Gelato place, Unleashed, CVS, Little Toni's, Adult Movie House, and a bar, so I guess you can say you can do a lot @ this location! Park, walk, eat, and shop.</text>

<text>I went there a few times, and while I think the food is a bit too greasy, I love the interior and appreciate it being kept unremodeled, but in a good shape. Maps of the UK on the walls, posters with old menus. If they were showing British news instead of the CNN, I'd think I'm not in the US.<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< user>

It is what it is. I think the only thing that really surprised me was that the fish was a large rectangle. Otherwise passable gooey deep fried junk food. Also the interior was much more pleasant than I would have expected.</text>

Wow waited years to come back to my favorite H.Salt location and it was terrible, perhaps the worst ever. The place smelled like 45 years worth of old oil and fish. I remember when this small chain was the place to go for Fish in Southern California. You've been warned!<//Review>

I never thought you could get  fried food wrong but I was mistaken. Batter has no flavor. I had the seafood combo and all of the "different food items" on my plate tasted the same. I could not get the aftertaste of oil out of mouth ..yuck!< /Text>

They need to change the oil. Oil is way to old and makes the fish taste 👎</review>

I used to like this place because I took pride in eating it when everyone else said it was gross. I would eat it a lot when I was hung over. Then the prices went up and I realized how freakin gross it was. I would recommend eating this if you are homeless and accustomed to eating garbage. But, if you are a regular person, go across the street to the habit and order a #1 combo for way less money and more quality food.< /text>

You will remember this review, so read on. When you walk into this place hungry- you are excited. The young blue eyed brown haired girl at the counter is super sweet. She really works hard to be on point in that American Pie kind of customer service and feel.We had ordered a Combo which she cheerily suggested  and also the standard Fish and Chips. After she was bombarded by a slew of creepy and sad customers and 1 bum that walked in- she still managed to treat everyone with respect and politeness. This chick is new I thought, she is how we all were at 17- young and bright full of eagerness to be a good employee. 25 minutes later, our food was ready. Excited, I go to the counter. Now she had asked if I needed anything else- and thats when the troll owner chimed in-" that will be 75 cents more". I felt bad for the young girl. This owner clearly needs that 75 cents enough to embarrass and undermine her only hard working employee.

The food: When I first saw the pile of grease that sat before us I said. "You've got to be kidding- is she trying to give us a heart attack" Here's why: for the 37 dollars we paid- this was all kinds of wrong. This owner needs to stop being the cliche dictator and CLEAN the OIL. When you fry fries at Burger King the Oil is changed 4 times. This seemes like it is changed every 4 months. Everything was soaking in grease. As if said owner never fried an eggroll in her life! You have to strain in- and twice before you pile it on. The fish: paper thin slices of frozen cod that will.make Gordon Ramsey slit his wrists. The dough fell apart as we bit and separated 3 slices of paper thin fish in hopes that it was fish...the Apalling! and to top it all off- the fries also frozen-were dark. Now look, I had heartburn all night and needed 5 tums to get through this situation. Incredible: the last thing is that the owner looks really busy, but I don't know what she was doing. Being a manager of a restaurant for many years- you can get sued for this kind of food and management style.
The KICKER: We see troll owner getting lunch from another restaurant, yes an Asian place, since the overpriced slop is not good enough for her. NEVER a good sign.
There's a time and a place for Fish and Chips, its not here- its not anytime soon at H Salt ( which btw nothing is salted here), maybe and more likely- in the owner's  back room sweat shop. But bring a hazard suit. Disgusting! and that young girl. Honey, Run. I feel like I paid 40 bucks to see abuse and have my heart attack 5 years earlier. Namaste North Hollywood.<//text>

Not what I remembered H.Salt being like. Fish was not good. Very soggy and greasy. Disappointing. I should have gone by previous reviews, but I thought that I'd give it a chance. I would not recommend eating here.</Review>

<Review>The batter was gooey and tasteless even though we ordered extra crispy and the fries tasted day old.  I see why they made squares or rectangles with the coating so it looks like you are getting more fish where actually the portion of fish inside is very small thus more batter.  They use to just coat the fish and gave you more fish.
Prices are high for the small servings on paper plates so save your money and go somewhere else.</Review>< user_id>

< Review>
I came here for lunch ..12$ for 2 pieces of bland fake fish , fries & onion rings , I tasted more grease than seasoning which disappointed me ...😒 you can go to a place like this in the black community and get real seasoned fish & fries for a reasonable price< /Review>

I want to put zero stars but I can't! This is the most greasy, bland, horrible fish that I've ever had! I can't believe they're still open! Please don't go here!<//Text>

We're in London and wanted to send our friend who lives in SF a gift for his birthday. We emailed La Luna asking if they could help us out. We had a very quick reply saying no problem, just let us know what you want and the delivery the address and we'll do the rest. And they sure did. Delivered exactly as promised as fantastic selection of cupcakes. We now have a very happy birthday boy and happy customers the other side of the pond. 😊< /review>

They were so patient and communicative from the start, and so gracious helping me correct my dumb mistakes! I placed my order online via the Google form, and got a response shortly after. The cupcakes were also reportedly delicious. Thank you so much for going the extra mile (literally) to make my grandmother's birthday special.</Text>

<Review>I first found La Luna when I started working in San Francisco. The location is dangerously convenient and the cupcakes are just so good! So much so that my husband and I ordered cupcakes for our intimate wedding reception. We had a hard time deciding but ultimately went with tres leches, hot chocolate, duo chocolate and vanilla, strawberry. So delicious and perfect for our special day!< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

The cupcakes are deliciously expensive but they have very friendly staff and can expedite a line quickly. It was a tougb decision on how many stars because for $3.50 for a single cupcake and & $1.75 for a mini that seems a bit high.<//text>

Omg. This place is so good that one cannot believe they haven't died and gone to heaven. The original is amazing, but the Oreo flavor is on another level too. Look no further for the best desserts spot in the world and indulge!<//Review>

It is definitely one of my favorite bakeries!!! I was quickly hooked on the caramel cake but I am a fan of the lemon cake, strawberry cake, and Oreo cupcake! The owner of the bakery has a very hands on approach to the business which I appreciate.< /Review><pics>None</pics><response>None</response><gmapID>0x80858089b4baa38d:0x3f1c37717fcea2e6< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Every cupcake I have tried has been delicious and they swap out flavors of the day to give a variety. I went in three days in a row for my office and the owner remembered me after one time. He welcomed me back with a smile and on the third day he gave me a free cupcake. He was always laughing and giving me suggestions on which cupcakes were his favorites. I would go back anytime!</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None< /resp>< GmapID>

The red velvet cupcakes had the creamiest frosting, and the best flavor! These are the best cupcakes I have EVER had!! The cupcakes weren't too sugary, and the staff were amazingly friendly! Definitely a must when coming to Sans Francisco!< /Review>

Love the cakes!
But once I order this mini red velvet cheesecake, and was just not worth it, it looks really cute, but it's just too expensive for nothing.<//review>

Although a lot of their cupcake flavors are just okay, they have one real winner. The tres leches cupcake is delicious! It's super soft and has cream in the middle. The frosting is also good and not too sweet.

They also serve froyo. The consistency is good, and more on the tart side which I enjoy.< /Review>

<Review>Elvia made mini-cupcakes for our wedding. They were absolutely delicious, drawing raves from our guests. She also came and built a lovely arrangement. On a scale of 1-5, I'd give La Luna a 6.< /Review><time>1407904302406</time>< resp>

They were so nice! The first time I ordered I need cupcakes at 8:45 in the morning, they usually open at 9 or 10. And they were ready! And were delicious! Tres Leches cupcakes taste exactly like Tres Leches Cake!

Going again soon!<//review>

<Name>Christine Mamuad<//Name><Review>Lovely people and the most delicious cupcakes make for a sweet experience! Tres leches is my undisputed favorite cupcake EVER, with its light, heavenly frosting and a delightfully moist, tasty cake that's not overly sweet, unlike most other cupcake stores. All the other flavors I've tried have been fantastic too, including red velvet, mocha, carrot, chocolate tres leches... oh my, I'm making myself drool. I usually monitor my caloric intake, but I make an exception here. Omnomnom!

UPDATE: I found a new favorite. The VEGAN vanilla cupcake. I am on the opposite spectrum of vegan, but boy oh boy do I love the vanilla vegan cupake.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

I met Ricky through a friend and he’s always made sure to get me in at his earliest convenience. Usually within a 24 hour notice. I come from a family of cosmetologist and a lot of friends that are barbers when i lived in SoCal. So i know what to look for, and these guys got it all. Clean even fades, no dark spots or low points. Perfectly blended cut lines and very understanding of different hairlines and styles. 10/10 would recommend.</review><Name>Chad Branson</Name><GmapID>0x808567da719d8d2f:0x81cdebce3f314f38<//GmapID><rate>5</rate></record></dataset><record>

About a year ago during my previous heavy use of social media,  I stumbled upon my highschool friend's (Ricky) post on IG regarding his and his brother Isaias' grand opening of their new own barbershop (1920 Barbershop)... although it's been many moons that Ricky and I have actually talked aside from the typical 'likes' and/or 'comments' on social media platforms, I was still very proud to see their accomplishments knowing that they've been in the barbering industry working for other barbershops for quite awhile. Due to my employment status with various jobs and also during my time in the military, I had been in and out of the 925 Concord area and state and also moved away from the 925, in which resulted in me having to find a barbershop closer to my location(s). As I was already living in Alameda and as soon as things settled with my regular job and transitioning out of military work, I decided to make an appointment with the shop to kill two birds with one stone -- simply say 'hello' and catch up with the brothers that I've friended since highschool (Ricky and Isais Huerta), and of course, stop by and support them by opting in for one of their gentlemen's cut services. MAN WAS I BLOWN AWAY! It really is the best feeling ever to receive a great 'fresh' cut, especially in a timely manner -- but... the VIBE of the shop including the Huerta brothers and the other fellow barbers and their clients.... definitely a great time! They've got great taste in music (chill vibes, in which now being in my 30s, I've transitioned to a much more 'chiller' state of mind haha), provide water/coffee, great hair products for almost every type o hair (and mind you, it's hard for a Filipino like me to find some good product to produce the hairstyle(s) I want due to the type of hair we have!),  awesome atmosphere with a definite '1920s' vibe mixed with a little modern stuff,  great conversations (aka 'therapy' hehe), and GREAT SERVICE OVERALL! Since then, I've been coming to the shop every time I needed a cut, despite now residing in Alameda. Why? Because not only are these guys my highschool friends,  the Huerta brothers AND their staff know how to work around my type of hair and understand the different 'cuts/styles' I mention to them despite the way I explain to them not being 'barbering technical terms' -- they follow through with a "I GOTCHU." statement, but also follow through in real time, producing the type of quality I like and love. I am also very proud of the way they handle the post quarantine lockdown situation, in which they've got signs all over the front door mentioning and showcasing the COVID-19 rules/workaround while being in the shop and receiving a cut/service -- MASKS ON upon entering and also a temperature check right then and there! Great job, 1920 Barbershop! 💈✂👏🏼< /text>

First time getting a real cut in over a year, and man it’s was worth it. Ricky was super cool and chill, and gave me the best cut I’ve ever gotten. Everything is super clean and and everyone is masked up. A+, s/o Ricky for bringing me back to life !< /review>

Beautiful shop, clean, great music and even nicer barbers.

Highly recommend them to anyone looking to get a cut in the East Bay. Fair prices and always enjoy my visit there. Shop is well located and very nice inside. Check it out yourself!

I decided to check out this barbershop because of the amazing 5 star reviews! 💈 I showed up with out an appointment and they sat me immediately! I was happy to find out they take walk-in haircuts. The barbers there are very talented. They live up to the 5 star reviews here on Google! Isaias Huerta cut my hair and he did such an amazing job! He recommended a new product for my hair type and showed me how to style it properly! I recommend you to stop what your doing and head to 1920 Barbershop for a fresh fade!<//Text>

I highly recommend this barbershop for anyone looking to get a great cut at a great price with a great experience!

I was recommended this barbershop from a friend and I’m so glad I decided to check it out. I called the shop and was able to schedule a same day appointment with Jonathan. Parking was easy and when I arrived everyone at the shop was welcoming and friendly. Jonathan was awesome! He made me feel comfortable even though it was my first time there and the haircut was exactly what I wanted!<//text>

<Review>Really welcoming place; had a great experience with Javier. As a transgender guy that doesn't pass as male, I was nervous about going to a barber shop, but these guys are queer / lgbtq+ friendly. "Hair is hair" is what they told me. Great prices, great cut, and great conversation.</Review>< rate>

<time>1593271090638< /time><text>I’ve been going here since opening, Ricky is my regular barber. The shop is clean, the barbers are friendly, the banter is lively- everyone talks to everyone sort of way. They’ve got a few screens with a mix of movies or sports playing on mute usually and the music is different every visit but always has a chill vibe. As to the haircuts, these guys are at the top of their game. They listen to what you’re asking for, they take their time, they pay attention to detail, and they get it right. Best haircuts I’ve ever had, and I’ve changed the style up a few times with him but he consistently delivers. My son’s become a regular, too, always looks sharp. I recommend them to friends all the time.< /text>< user_name>

Jonathan Corral is the best barber I've ever met (sounds hyperbolic but seriously not exaggerating). I've gone to him on and off for the last 2 years, and he does consistently great work.

He teaches barber techniques at a school for others studying to get their license, and just really knows his stuff and cares a lot about his craft.

The shop is a great place too, and always a welcoming place. Great sanitization and compliance with covid regulations as well.

Thanks y'all!<//review>

Carlos has been my barber for a while now, he’s great at what he does! I would get a haircut from any of the guys there, I’ve spoken to all of them, they’re personable, knowledgeable and all around great people. I feel comfortable going there with my kids.< /text>

<Text>I have been getting shaves and haircuts from Javier Ramos for years now and have never been disappointed. Clean, professional, detail oriented.  1920 Barbershop has an awesome vibe and all of the barbers are professional and genuinely friendly leaving you looking sharp.
Always welcoming to new comers, they listen to what type of style you like and they’ll make it happen.</Text>< username>

I have been to multiple barbershops and all feel like a business. 1920 barbershop is family owned and the staff are beyond friendly and helpful. It’s a great place for people of all ages to get a haircut. They also offer the full 1920 barber experience. Definitely recommended. Trust me, you will not be disappointed!!<//review>< Pictures>

I recently move to Concord and was looking for a place to get a haircut, I founded  this  amazing barbershop and decided to give a try. I Called and was able to make an appointment with Ricky. When I walked in to the space I was mind blowing by how nice, clean  and welcoming this place is. Everyone is super friendly and they make you feel they appreciate your business.
I’m very particular on how I like my haircut done and Ricky did an amazing job, that here I’m getting my haircut every other week.
Definitely not going anywhere else!!!< /text>

<Text>I've been getting cut from Ricky for over a year now, and I'll say his craftsmanship with cutting hair is by far the best I've ever seen with my past experiences! I'm proud to be his regular customer when it's time for my cut! He's a really humble and chill guy! He will take his time with you and make sure he does whatever it is you ask of him! If there's any barber I trust, it's him for sure! Besides, when I set up an appointment and go to him, he already knows what style hair I've been going with for a while now! His brother is really good too as I watch him cut other people! The shop is nice little spot for him, his brother, and the other barbers there! Got the nice music to set up the vibes while you are in the seat getting your cut as well! Set up an appointment with them and trust me, you will not be disappointed! I Highly recommend this nice spot for a cut! Keep it up Ricky and everyone else in the shop!<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures><response>{'time': 1567656578407, 'text': 'Thank you for the review'}< /response><GmapID>0x808567da719d8d2f:0x81cdebce3f314f38</GmapID></record></dataset><record>
<Text>Overall a great experience! Quality hair cuts in a great atmosphere. Not only are the hair cuts amazing, but the customer service is always professional and premium. Also what separates them from other barbershops is the professional and casual/laid back environment. Top tier shop to get a quality hair cut, have good conversation with adults, and relax. The barbers make sure that everyone feels welcome in their barber shop. Definitely will return and highly recommend everyone to stop by!</Text><resp>{'time': 1568354729160, 'text': 'Thank you so much for taking the time to leave us this amazing review.'}< /resp><pics>None< /pics><date>1568266084495<//date><gmapID>0x808567da719d8d2f:0x81cdebce3f314f38</gmapID>< Rate>

1920 Barbershop has unique atmosphere with state of the art equipment. Definitely the best spot in town. The barbers here are very friendly and do a great job. They are really good at listening to what you want and will regularly check to make sure the haircut is coming out the way you want it to. On top of that they give lots of pro tips and suggestions. The over all vibe there is great, I highly recommend this place!</Text>

This place is the best shop in Concord! Isaiah and his brother recently opened up their own barber shop. These guys are the only ones I'll let cut my hair. Every time I go here they do an excellent job and are fast and professional. They go the extra mile and make sure that they didn't miss anything and check with the customer that they gave them exactly what they wanted. Don't go anywhere else.< /Text>

The barbers here will listen to what you want while still providing their expertise to get you looking sharp. The shop is always exceptionally clean and the relaxed atmosphere as well as good conversation will keep you coming back on a regular basis.< /Text>< Pictures>

<text>Just came here with my son and am so glad to have such a classy barber shop to cut our hair. They are all about service and creating a partnership between themselves and the clients. They are people whom I can trust and can look forward to enjoying their service monthly. The shop is clean, with beautiful antique barbershop chairs and items from the past. They are committed to providing both an exceptional and memorable experience and I highly recommend this shop to anyone who appreciate these values.</text><gmap_id>0x808567da719d8d2f:0x81cdebce3f314f38<//gmap_id>< rate>

<text>Place is super clean and brand new. The owners, who are brothers, know their stuff and treat you well. I think they recently added on two more barbers to accommodate walk ins, but it’s always better to book an appointment. Any one of these guys will get you right though. Isaias cut my hair and paid extra attention to detail, making sure my fade was on point. I’m a firm believer that getting your haircut should be a relaxing experience and this shop does not let you down. From the moment you sit in their vintage barber chairs they make you feel like you’re being taken care of. The shop is close enough to Hop Grenade that I walked over and had a bite to eat and a beer for lunch. Not too bad for an afternoon of self care.</text>< Pictures>

The haircut was FANTASTIC. The barbers are friendly and welcoming and the overall feel of the establishment was exactly what you expect from a barber. I have already scheduled my next cut. I will be a repeat customer for quite a while.< /Review>

<Review>We drove all the way from San Jose to get an open barber and boy, what a pleasant surprise  The ambiance in this barbar shop is great. Mix of anciant luxureously restored barber chairs with uplifting music and videos nicely complement the passion  and skills of the barbers. Isaias did an awesome job resulting in lots of complements on my new style. Definitely worth the hour drive from San Jose. I'll have to do this again even after my local barber shops open  up again after Covit</Review><gmapID>0x808567da719d8d2f:0x81cdebce3f314f38</gmapID><Rating>5<//Rating>< user>

Great little gem of a barbershop! Located in the wonderful Todo Santos park, it's a shame that many are sleeping on this place. Stop by and hit up Carlos Leuterio when you do. He did amazing work on me even though I had no idea what kind of look I wanted. Give him a small picture of what you want, he'll craft it before your eyes. Keep up the good work guys!< /Review>

This is a TOP Notch Barbershop 💈. The Barbers are experienced and the atmosphere is very friendly. First rate, high quality  and very affordable.  You can get the works done here. I get a haircut and beard groom. They also sell hair and beard products also very affordable. A one stop shop. If you looking to get well groomed, I recommend you stop by and check out 1920 Barbershop.< /Review>

<review>1920 is a great place to get a nice haircut. Ricky has been cleaning me and my kids for the past 3 years. He is super nice and professional. The kids love seeing him. He's easy to talk to and his cuts are exactly what I ask for. I leave there feeling Hella Handsome. I highly recommend Ricky and 1920 Barbershop.<//review>< Name>

<review>I have been getting my haircut by Ricky at 1920 Barbershop for almost seven years now; i can say every cut has been five star worthy! I honestly have not had my haircut by anyone else since. The babershop is clean, inviting, and has me feeling like a brand new man everytime I leave. These guys are top notch and are sure to give you the best haircut and shave you have had.</review><pics>None</pics>< response>

1920 Barbershop is definitely a great place. I been going there religiously every two weeks since they opened and always got great service. They have nice retro decoration all over the shop and 2 big screen TVs to enjoy while getting your haircut or waiting for one. I will keep going there and I am really happy with service that my Barber Isias provides.</text>

I have been going to Ricky for 6 years and he is the only person who I will let touch my hair! Him and his brother a true professionals.

If you want that haircut that gives you confidence to get that next job, that new girl, or whatever else you need to look sharp for Ricky Huerta is your man!</Review>

<Text>Best barbershop in the West! My son gets compliments all the time about his nice ‘doo’. Before Isaias and his brother opened shop my son hated going to get his haircut but now he tells me it’s time! Another great thing about the shop is you can make appointments easily they text you within an hour so no waiting around for hours!

This spot is legit. The barbers are very professional, skilled, and friendly. Been going to this shop since it opened and I don't trust anyone else to cut my hair anymore. Isaias always does a great job getting me in for appointments. definitely recommend this place for anyone looking for a dope barbershop in the Concord area.</Text>

<Review>This spot is legit. The barbers are very professional, skilled, and friendly. Been going to this shop since it opened and I don't trust anyone else to cut my hair anymore. Isaias always does a great job getting me in for appointments. definitely recommend this place for anyone looking for a dope barbershop in the Concord area.< /Review><pics>None<//pics><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

Great location and high experienced barbers. Been going to Ricky for over 7 years. The shop is brand new with nice wooden floors, custom old school chairs, TVs and quality barbers.< /Text>

Been getting cut by Isaias since like 2012, even before they opened up this shop. He and his brother are very meticulous and really listen to their clients and make sure they’re getting the exact haircut they want. They cut all hair types and can do trendy or classic styles. Just speak up and make sure to tell them what you want, bring pictures, etc. Isaias has helped me come up with what I want to do with my hair every time I change up what style I’m going for.  They’ll  impress you with their flexibility and versatility. They do fades, hot towel shaves, scissor cuts, beard line ups, shape ups, you name it.

The shop itself looks really modern and cozy. Big screens, good music and a wide range of styling products, from pomades to beard oils and more.

Couldn’t recommend them more if you’re looking for a more premium haircut, help with a new style, or beard clean up.</review>

<rating>5<//rating><review>1920 Barber shop is a local hidden gem for those men that need to get a great quality gentlemen’s haircut. I highly recommend both Ricky and Isaias. These guys do amazing work on any style and any type of hair. I have relied on these guys to keep me looking at my best. They always find time to get me a quick appointment! The new Parlor is amazing with authentic 1920’s era barber chairs, twin flat screens, and...a bar downstairs! If you are looking for your next hairstyle or a new barber.... I would give 1920 a look.</review>< pics>

My first experience with the owners, Ricky and Isaias, was a few years back, at the last shop they worked at. I had haircuts by each of them over the years. They both were super personable from the day I met them and continued to be easily accessible and flexible for appointments (and sometimes even last minute drop ins).
Unlike A LOT of these barbers you get now-a-days, they never make you feel like you’re bothering them or you should “feel HONORED” to even have them cut your hair. They’re two good dudes, raised polite and seem to want to get to know you the more you come see them.
Isaias is the first barber to make my young son feel comfortable and actually look forward to getting his haircuts.
So of course, when they told me they were starting 1920 Barbershop, I followed them! My son and I made our first visit to their new shop today and we were VERY impressed. The shop has a cool old school barber shop feel with modern touches to freshen up the vibe.
I highly recommend you visit these guys and you’ll see why I rated 5 stars and speak highly of them. Keep it up fellas!!< /text>

Just got my first cut here and it went beyond expectations, the place was nice and clean along with the barbers being very welcoming. The room itself is spacious and has 2 flatscreen TV's (where I enjoyed watching The Matrix) and the place is kept very tidy. I recommend this place to anyone looking for a legit, clean, and timely haircut.<//Text>

<Review>My son and I have been getting our haircut from Isiahas for many years now.

When Isiahas and his brother told me they were opening up their own shop I didn't think twice about sticking with them.

If getting a top notch, clean and consistent haircut is important to you then go to 1920.<//Review><Response>{'time': 1568421293246, 'text': 'Thank you for remaining loyal to Isaias and 1920!'}</Response>< user>

If you want a top grade cut, 1920 Barbershop is the place to get it! I've known the owners, Isais and Ricky, since 2013 when I first met them at the barbershop they previously cut at. Ever since 2013, I've been getting cut by Isais, and I can trust that my haircut will always be top quality when I go to him. He offers great advice on hairstyles and will work with you to make sure you get the cut you want and are more than satisfied when you walk out. I can guarantee that you'll look fresh once you walk out of there. My fade, line up, and comb over always looks fresh and I am always complimented by others with Isais's work. Both Isais and Ricky are personable and professional. They will make you feel welcomed every time you come in - it's like seeing family once you walk through those doors. The shop is clean and has that 1920s barbershop feel with a touch of modern to it. They also have a variety of hair products for sell, so if you need to restock your hair products at home, you can do so here! I don't trust anyone else with my cut besides these guys. I always make it a point to schedule my cuts in advance with Isais to make sure he is the one cutting me. I definitely recommend this barbershop to anyone in the area looking for a top quality cut!<//review>

I  really like Ricky Huerta barbering. He styles my haircut to what I ask for and does a great job.   Everyone wears masks.  Second, because of his appointment booking, I never have to wait.  Third, the bathroom is always clean and is frequently checked.  The large barbering room is very neat , sunny, and airy.  The atmosphere is 1920's  along with the refurbished old barber chairs  and the leather aprons his crew uses.<//text>

<Text>Authentic. Love.

This church has changed my life and offered me a 2nd chance at Christianity.    I've been jaded by church and by religion.  I could honestly say - before coming here - Christianity was dead to me.   If that is you too -  you might want to check this place out.
My experience at Centerpoint has been only positive.   These people wake up every day and seek to change their world for the better.
They care about their community.  They care about each other. They are compassionate, intelligent, and genuine.
I work behind the scenes at Centerpoint -  I see the REAL story here - and I have been deeply impressed by the authenticity of this place.

All types of community - all backgrounds and ethnicities.   The vibe is young, passionate, and free.

If you want to surround yourself with genuine people -  come and see for yourself.<//Text>< Pics>

I first drove by Centerpoint Church In January 2012 and since then my life has never been the same! I had been church "shopping" for awhile and the moment I stepped foot on this campus, I knew I was home! Throughout the years I have been able to grow in my relationship with God and get in touch with my spiritual gift. Whatever it is you are seeking, for a stronger connection with God...somebody will help you find it here!!< /review>

<review>The reason I got connected at Centerpoint a few years ago was the value for community and the vision to reach more people with the love of Jesus. I wanted to be a part of a church that embraces the call to live like Jesus and is on a mission to make a difference in the community. And since being here I've built relationships that inspire me to do just that! I love the people of Centerpoint and the heart of the church. It's home.</review><Resp>None</Resp>< GmapID>

I love centerpoint church. They offer a phenomenal children’s program as well as youth program. The pastor preaches the word of God and they have an awesome freedom prayer ministry. They also offer celebrate recovery on Friday nights. I would definitely say check it out.<//text>

<text>Seek Night is like going to a free Christian concert! But it's even more than a concert, because there's a sermon, too. Seek Night is young musicians singing, & playing their hearts out for God, church members coming together mid-week to praise God, an amazing sermon that's real, down-to-earth & relevant to what is happening in these times. It's a wonderful, God-glorifying, uplifting experience.</text>< Pics>

Worship is AWESOME, and takes you into the presence of God. The love of God envelopes you as the musicians and worshippers play/sing. It's like waves of water flowing over you. I love how Centerpoint has speakers who are real, and raw. What Life throws at us is beyond candy coated christianty. So, hearing speakers who deal with real life is refreshing.< /Text><user_name>CJ Bluebow< /user_name>< rating>

Pastor John Hansen is touched by God.  He has a depth of annointing transcends and is infectious. Pastors Kim, Tim and Allen make you feel right at home.

They have wonderful youth pastors and children's program, including babysitting.

I can't attend every live service on Sunday ... I do live  stream every Sunday.< /review>

I’ve been a couple times with my family, and this church is flat out blessed. You can just feel Gods presence when you walk in. No fakes, everyone just comes as they are and I really appreciate that. God deff has his hand on this church. Keep up all of what you’re doing center point, because God is deff using you to work in mine and my whole families lives. We love you ❤️🙏🏻< /review>

This church is amazing. I love my church family I go here on Saturdays and love the people and the fellowship.</Review>

< review>
The people are very nice, the music was great, the pastor was friendly,  but we were very caught off guard by the fact of that this church is very Pentecostal. There is people shouting out at random times, even during the service,  people speaking in tongues out loud without an interpreter as the Bible says to do,  people will laugh out loud, I have heard that  some people believe it’s the Holy Spirit coming over them, there is a lot of dancing and waving of the arms, and people gathering in front of the stage and doing all these things. Some people may be fine with this, but it is not what we were expecting at all, and it caught us off guard, And made us uncomfortable. Especially because they’re not called a Pentecostal church as far as we know, and they are very Pentecostal here at this church.  All these different things were going on at different times during the service, and for us it was very distracting.  We were even surprised to see that the pastor walked out and people were cheering and yelling for him as if he were a rockstar, and he started singing. It was very different. Not something you see every day in a church.  I just hope and pray that this church remembers what it is supposed to be all about and that they keep their eyes on Jesus.<//review>

I am with promise Keepers. My Name is Coach Scott Brescol and visited your Church the Sunday before Father's Day. Through God I met his word Coaching 10 year Olds, years later he introduced me to a Heavenly Vision Lisa Blake. God has mysterious ways introducing people that Comfort the Heart through Jesus. I have a Friend Nashville writing a Song about her" The Friend I Never Met!"  For her Mom and Her and Her Children a 2018 Calendar of her and her Family. I went to see people I had Coached and saw in 30 years, now in Arizona taking care of an 89 year old Uncle and Mom who are dying. I gave up two great jobs and Coaching and a Solid based God fairing people. When I was heading back from Temecula and stopped in Murrietta to get gas Sunday they told me about your Church so I stopped in and this I have to say; So Spirit filled I was led to try and Start a Group called (S.A.N.G.) Save America's Next Generation. The Lady Lisa and Her Children and there Smiles helped me want Young ones be able to have 600 more years and try an put this Earth back to a Garden of Eden. Thanks through Coaching again eating with former Students and Stopping for Gas I was led to Centerpoint and now every morning I lift Your Spirit Filled Church and The Heavenly Vision From God Lisa Blake and Her Beautiful Family. I may never see your Church again unless you invite me to Speak, but if You see me on TV lift me up in Prayer that I may reach the Hearts of Millions to bring Peace to the World.
May God Bring Your Church Body and Community Love, Joy and Respect.
Coach Scott

I Can Go On And On! The Pastors are awesome! John and Ann, you take time to study the Bible and pray for all of us! You communicate well with each other and the "church family" which immediately welcomes us. You give us Truth and Hope. Thank God for You! If anyone has had a bad church experience, you can change that around at CenterPoint. Start living Free! This church is truly a life changing connection closer to Christ...and we're all apart of it! Wanna know how I got connected? Check it Out! "Living Waters" Album by the CenterPoint Worship team! They have the continuous gift of giving! Youtube them or get a CD at the church or website. Everyone needs to get their CenterPoint On Sometime.....Sunday at 12Noon! See you there!< /text>

<Text>I like going to Juice it Up. I’m a regular customer.  Today was not a pleasant visit at the Moreno Valley store. This was my first time stopping at this store. My daughter was visiting the ATT Store next door. So my mother in law and I walked in and stood at the counter for a few minutes. We were not greeted, did not receive a one moment please, nothing! We looked at each other and we both were thinking the same exact thing. They won’t get my money today. We just walked right out. Most locations yell greetings as you walk inside or at least acknowledge your presence. Very disappointing!< /Text><user_id>115024370077213192759< /user_id>< Rating>

I used to work at this place when I was 19 and the customer service I provided was GREAT! The owner(s) of this franchise are good people and are always focused on providing their patrons with fast and friendly service. The only reason I can think of as to why some people might say the customer service *is or *was bad is likely do to the hiring of some kids straight out of High School looking for their first job which can be a detriment sometimes because such "kids" aren't always MATURE enough to realize that quality service is a vital skill in the workforce.< /Review>

<text>I Always like going to this juice it up , the staff there always make my day. I appreciate how the staff/management are always on it by keeping the place tidy and always helpful when it comes down to recommendations . The Juice It Up by my house is a little closer but I still drive to this one , I always tell people that this place is the spot. Always friendly and calm environment.</text>< pics>

The place is great. My smoothie was good. But they really need to work on their customer service. I didn't feel welcomed at all while in there. I didn't even receive a greeting. And the workers just stared at me blankly until I ordered. The people at Jamba Juice are way better at their friendliness. I hope they reconsider how they treat their customers.</Text>

Hit or miss...visited several times in the past few weeks and sometimes people working there have been nice and smoothies were perfect. Other times the smoothies were terrible and we had to toss them...what a waste. Taste your smoothie before you drive away.</Text>

I asked if she had a juice with spinach and kale. And she oh we have something like that with orange juice. Really  🤦‍♀️< /Review>

My wife and I went in before our work out and the lady was so rude because we only had a $100 bill ...like you don't have to be super sarcastic to serve drinks or decline our money because you can't count to make change 😎<//Text>

I'll admit, I always thought of Little Caesars as low quality due to the low price. I've had it a few times before and decided I'd finally buy some for myself. I tried almost all of the specialties, the extra pepperoni, the baked cheese crust, and the pretzel crust with cheese sauce. All three were great and the cheese crust with fresh mozzarella and basil actually tasted like the pizza you'd get from a restaurant. And you can't beat the price, paid less than $20 for all three pizzas. I was pleasantly surprised and I'll definitely be coming here for pizza from now on.<//Text>

< Review>
Slowly this location has bit the dust in terms of food quality and service. I have continued to go to this location for a year now and will now switch, just so I can have better consistency with my pizza.

I grew up in Michigan surrounded by Little Caesars pizza so I love the company and taste. This location however has continued to mess up called in orders, overcharged five dollars on pizza, and consistently produce terrible breadsticks.

I am not saying Little Caesars is the most gourmet pizza out there, but burnt breadsticks with no butter and very little cheese is definitely not what Mike Ilitch, the founder of LC, had imagined or produced when he started his own LC.

I hope more people stop going here because I know I am. I gave them multiple chances to get right and they just continue to disappoint.</Review>

My wife & I were not impressed with the lack of  basic manners of the employee who took our order at the front counter. He seemed more interested in contradicting us than in helping us with our order.  (Friday evening 9/7/18). This has happened on other occasions as well. We'll be taking our business to a different pizza parlor in the future.<//Text>

<review>Well I first tried placing an order online and it wouldn't allow me to choose a payment like it asked me to so I then I called the number on their website for the exact store I was going to and the number is not excepting calls. Now I'm stuck going down there to just sit while the make my pizza. What's the the point of having a web page if none of the information is incorrect?<//review>< pics>

The girls here have no idea what they are doing. They ring you up wrong, have no idea how to void their mistake and then overcharge you because they have no idea how tax works! It was a pathetic visit and the pizza was not put together well either. I used to love this location but now I think I will make the drive to the one on Chapman and Raymond! Much better service and quality there!<//Text>

They have the cash to make change for the $100, they just won't accept them.

Kinda ridiculous if you ask me. Wonder if they would accept a $100 bill if I order $80 worth of pizza?< /text>< Pictures>

<Text>Arrived  at  store at 11 am door unlocked  when  in no one at register  stood there for a few minutes  watching employee  make pizza call and asked if  anyone working register   woman  said  someone in bathroom

Waited several more minutes  watched employee  put 6 pizzas  in ready rack.
Woman came  to register  told her I wanted 2 pizzas  she stated won't  be open and ready for  another  15 to 20 minutes
I told her there are 6 pizzas in rack  ready to go
She stated were not set up and ready  to sell

When  then was the door open register  turned on and rack had pizzas ?

We're they only for display  they just came out to  oven

Also they charge  more than any other little caesars
Won't  be going back to  this store again

<review>The pizza prices are the highest among other Little Caesars I go to. The others I go to are the the advertised prices on tv, but not here. They charge more and cover the prices with a file envelope and use a Sharpie to write their price on it. At least make it look professional and use a computer and print the price. Also,  they were closed down by the Health Department. The pizza taste is not consistent.</review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None</response>< gmapID>

This was the worst customer service I have received. I placed my order over the phone. The girl who answered seemed bothered that I had called and couldnt not even tell me my total so i knew what I would be paying. When I arrived 2 guys were sitting on the counters in the back watching videeos on there phone. The girl who helped me again seemed very bothered. I asked if they had any other soda then the Pepsai and Sierra Mist like their website says they do. Her response was " No, we dont go by our website I dont know why they have one". I understand that these are young kids and need to be trainined, so I am not saying it is total thier fault. But where is management? Why are they not training and overseeing their employees. I will not go back to this location again. Management needs to do thier job and maybe the employees will do theirs.</Review>

I hardly ever write reviews for anything since I’m always on the go but I felt like in this scenario little Caesar’s deserves to be recognized & Recognition I was just there maybe about 10 minutes ago after a long night of sleeping in my car and being stressed when I was able to gather a little bit of money to buy myself a pizza unfortunately I did not have enough to cover the pizza but this really sweet cashier named Jocelyn was nice enough to cover it for me. Not only do I feel like I was blessed but I just want to give her a big shout out ! Thank you little caesars I truly appreciate it & thank you Jocelyn. May your 2019 be filled with blessings.</Text>

the employees are very friendly especially the assistant managers Jordon and Samantha who display a professional demeanor and the pizza is great, especially the new pretzel crust. however i did notice that a man who seemed to be the manager either sat in his office all day or just stood there on his cell phone while the employees struggled when it got super busy. i just thought that was very lazy and unprofessional of him to not help at all.<//Text>

If I could give this place no stars I would, not for the pizza since it all comes out of a freezer, but the piss poor customer service.

This was my experience: I needed a pizza place close by for a large order of both cheese and pepperoni pizzas for my daughters school. These bozo's were close so I called, and called, and called. After an hour someone finally answered. That should have been my first sign. I placed my order for many pizzas for pickup in 2 days. 2 days later, I arrived promptly at 10:30 for pickup as I was instructed and was informed they did not make the correct amount of cheese pizzas and I could either wait an extra 20 minutes + so they could make more or take more pepperoni. The rude blond girl child at the register became upset at me when I was frustrated at this, no manager there by the way and definitely no apologies. Since the planned lunch for the kids was at 11 and I could not just run to another pizza place and have the pizza in time I took the pepperoni and went to the school.

So some of the kids did not get to eat due to dietary restrictions (no pork) not enough cheese pizza to go around or some just did not like pepperoni.

Point is they messed up sorely and did not care about customer service. They informed me they needed 24 hour notice and I gave them 48. No excuses for this. I reported them to corporate.<//text>

<Text>It is a great little Caesars. Remeber that they are cheap pizzas that are not usually made to order. The food is good and service is fine. Just don't expect gourmet food or service. It is clean but a little more expensive than other LCs. I like the location better than the one near me. Anyway it is good for a quick cheap pizza. Dont expect anything other than that and you will be fine.<//Text>< Pictures>

<review>I received a pizza, realized it was cold when I went home, but tried to eat it and the pizza was tasteless!! Took it back thinking it would be better, but even with a hot pizza the pepperoni had no tasteless. I went back twice to talk with the manage, whom did not give me a call. He suggested I call corporate office bcs they supply all the ingredients. So if they is the case shame on you Little Ceasar for putting out inferior pizza!! I had pissa from the same location with no problem, my roommate tasted the pizza and commented on the tasteless pizza. To top it off the market/owner insuled me in front of two customers saying, "If everyone did what I expressed Little Ceasar would be out of business." I doubt that many people would who expressed their dissatisfaction would put the company out of business!! I could not even talk with Little Ceasar Corporate off to see what the problem was. Iay try another LC, but if it's not up to the quality I had experienced to be very good with previous and bragged about how good it was at that time!! Two thumbs down to the manager solution to insuling me to try to make him look good!! Look in the mirror and brush up on how to assist a customer!! Very dissappointed with LC Corporate, LC owner/mgr, most of all the quality of the pizza I used to enjoy!!< /review>< Pictures>

i used to work here and the employees give a spectacular effort into making each and every customers pizza perfect, however one thing that isnt right that i noticed about the manager is that he has made crude comments about the african american race. The manager is very unprofessional and treats his workers very poorly. other than that the employees do a great job making sure the customer gets their food as quickly as possible.<//review>

<text>I am not one to write reviews, but given my experience today, I found it imperative to give my highest recommendation.

My experience at ZenDental with Dr. Raschkovsky, and her professional amicable staff was impeccable. As a longtime resident of DTLA, I am thankful for her expertise, her friendly nature, and having a safe clean environment. I can not recommend her enough.

My visit there was not for a good reason, because I got a tooth broken and unfortunately we had to extract it.
But Dr. Alessandra was very super professional and kind and made everything happens smoothly with no complications after the surgery as well.</text>

I love this dentist & staff! I went there today for the first time and it was sort of fun. I have never left the dentist thinking that, let alone leaving having a cavity filled. Best dentist in downtown los angeles for sure. Highly recommend.<//Text>

<Text>New patient. I've chosen Dr. Alessandra based on the reviews I've read about the office and the bonus that is within walking distance of my current home. I'm glad i made the choice and if it happens that i move somewhere else in LA it's quite likely I'll continue to use this office for my dental needs.< /Text>< pictures>

I always enjoy my experience when I visit Zen, all of the girls, and Alessandra are hilarious.. I think they could eventual turn the practice into a TV show :) Thought I would show some public love, thanks for taking care of the broski, wife and I's mouthses. Attached is a picture of Wolfie - I hope you all like him :-B< /Review>

I hadn't been to the dentist in an embarrassing amount of time. But, I am so glad I found Zen Dental. The staff was so friendly and welcoming. Dr. Alessandra was hilarious and informative. Like, I literally kept spitting on her due to laughing so much (and spit glands). So glad I found her. Also, if you're in DTLA, it's in walking distance. HUGE Bonus!!</Text>

<review>I had not been to a dentist in a while and man was that a great experience! Pain free! I even got to watch one of my favorite movies on a headset while she performed a deep cleaning.

I have been twice now, and I'm thoroughly impressed by the speedy but thorough work of their staff, how modern and clean their facilities are, as well as how reasonably priced their services are. Truly a trustworthy dental practice. Couldn't recommend them enough!< /Review>< Pics>

I hadn't been to a dentist in a couple years, due to a bad experience. I finally had the courage to go see a dentist and my wife introduce me Dr. Alessandra, I can't begin to say how grateful I am.

From the moment you walk in you feel welcomed (thanks to the receptionist!). There's a nice cozy feel to the office.

Once you're in the dreaded "chair" Dr. Alessandra and her team of hygienists make sure you feel comfortable a ready. They are clear to communicate what they are doing and pause when the occasional break is necessary. For those looking for a distraction during longer sessions they even have headsets paired with Netflix!

Personally I had a lot to be done, cavities, crown and cleaning. All it took was two visits and were near painless and they reached out to me after each appointment to see how I was doing. In addition, Dr. Alessandra was also concerned with other aspects of my oral health and helped me create new routines and action plans to help prevent further damage in the future.

The hygienist I had was great. She took her time and wasn't rough with me.
Dr. Alessandra is seriously the best! To the way she went over my teeth with me and just chatting. She really helped me have an enjoyable experience!
After my first cleaning in 2 years I was surprisingly looking forward to the next time I would be in the office. Never thought I'd say that!

Just an amazing office overall!!!</review>

<text>I don't write reviews but I have to share my impeccable experience.  I came here because I had a dental emergency and received the most amazing treatment in a state of the art facility.  They were quick fast and didn't treat me like a number but truly as a pampered patient.  I am a single parent on a budget and they helped me with all of my options.  The doctor truly provided me with a plan to remediate my dental issues and didn't make me feel bad for not going to dentist.

I am so happy to feel like I am part of their dental family (so to speak).  The office is immaculate, state of the art, clean, and has a spa atmosphere.  The Dr. Is quick, fast, smart, and personable.

I recommend this office for parents who want to take your teens to the dentist.< /text><pics>None</pics><resp>None</resp><GmapID>0x80c2c7cb74e3b761:0x9baaf7cdb8f61c60<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

I have found a new dentist and her name is Alessandra. My old dentist only saw me as a customer and didn't offer advice or care about my teeth, so I went out looking for a new dentist. The moment I sat in Alessandra's chair, she immediately made me feel comfortable and took notice of my teeth's condition. I grind my teeth bad and have been for years but my old dentist never made a comment however Alessandra gave me some advice and even recommended a specialist to help assist me with another procedure. Not only that, I was able to see her in less than 48 hours after I reached out; everywhere else had over a week wait. Hands down the best and I highly highly highly recommend Alessandra.</Text>

I had a crown fall off and Alessandra and her staff were amazing. Not only did they take me right away, she fixed the chipped part of my crown and evened out some asymmetry so my smile looks better than ever. I have lots of crowns and sometimes dentists try to up sell me lots of things I don’t need, but Alessandra was honest, funny, and did the best work. She’s definitely an artist of teeth. Thank you!</text>

<Text>First off, this place really bullied me into writing a five star review when I went to them. I decided not to do so. Now that I am no longer a customer of theirs I feel that I can give an honest opinion here. They were not up front about any of the costs with root canals and with crowns.

They send you elsewhere to get the root canal done, this other place drains any insurance that you have. Then you come back to them for the crown (you can't go very long without a crown after a root canal). You're forced to pay them for the service. I paid everything up front, as I didn't want any bills.

The treatment was moderately adequate. I do have to say that the topical anesthesia for the gums did not numb me and the dentist didn't care! The crown also ended up coming out a year after that, so I went to another dentist for a quick fix (they are now my regular dentist).

Two years later (today) I received a bill in the mail saying "final attempt" for almost $500, they never tried contacting me before and now I owe them money? This is disgraceful. BEWARE OF THESE SCAM ARTISTS AND FAKE REVIEWS (Save your money and go elsewhere)!

UPDATE: They also "responded" saying it's for another office - don't believe them. This is ridiculous ... protect yourself and go elsewhere!<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

<Review>Let me share my experience of my visit to zen-dental this morning. After an easy scheduling  I went to place well located in downtown LA. Parked on the extra door public parking building (5$ After validation on zendental)
The facility has a great waiting room. Is amazing how relaxed you could get after seeing the design and colors from inside.
My problem was an impacted wisdom tooth 🦷, i got an X-ray followed by an extraction.
Dr Alessandra and her assistant Marcela were very attentive to everything. I didn’t feel any pain. The whole procedure last less than 15 minutes !
Totally Recommended !!!
Thank you zen dental !!!!</Review>< Pictures>

<text>I've always had a good experience at Zen Dental.  Dr. Alessandra is very nice, thorough, and makes sure you get good care.  They're good about making sure you're thoroughly numbed when drilling--there's no need to feel anything.  The office is clean, staff are friendly, and they always remember you and there is rarely a wait when you have an appointment.<//text><response>None<//response><UserId.>117933012196832669332<//UserId.><pictures>None</pictures><time>1533931669881< /time>< GmapID>

Always a wonderful experience, came in for a regular cleaning as usual... Zen is close by to my office in downtown, so it's super easy for me to just stroll in. The office staff are very polite and personable, suggested some useful dental insurance programs I could jump into... (Have some pretty serious cavities I've been procrastinating on.) Anyway! I'd highly recommend, especially if you live within proximity. Super comfortable to visit and I always leave feeling far more confident about myself. Couldn't be more pleased with the experience. Will likely be in touch soon.<//review>

As always, Dr Alessandra and her team never disappoint.   I am always met with a friendly smile and hello by everyone there.  What a great warm atmosphere that is not usually associated with a medical or dental office.  I love it and recommend Zen Dental to all my friends and relatives.</review>

<Review>I can't say enough good things about Alessandra and her wonderful team. I'm not a fan of going to the dentist. Maybe I have a low pain tolerance but it always seems to hurt-even just the cleanings. However, Alessandra actually cares about how I'm feeling and it doesn't hurt when she works on my teeth. I was a fan the first time I walked into their office but what really made me write this review is the way she worked with my kids. I have 4 and 6 year old girls. My oldest was terrified of the dentist. We tried every kid dentist in the area and she wouldn't let anyone near her even with the laughing gas. After two visits with Alessandra she was smiling and sitting still in the chair. Alessandra took the time to build a real relationship with both my girls and gained their trust so quickly. I watched it and still don't know how she did it. Her team is also amazing. My youngest helped clean my teeth and now tells me she wants to be a dentist. I can't thank Alexandra and her team enough. Their patience, kindness, and talents have made a huge difference in my family's visits to the dentist. Thank you!</Review>< pictures>

<review>Went in to have my 4 wisdom teeth extracted due too complications. I was nervous and skeptical, super afraid of the pain and the results.
Dr Alessandra made sure i felt comfortable enough, made me laugh a lot, made sure I wasn’t feeling any pain before she even started the procedure, also gave me an AWESOME 3D glasses to watch Netflix while she worked on me. All in all, it was an amazing and super quick procedure, decent price and NO PAIN! Im so glad I’ve got to cross paths with such a professional Dr, feels like I didn’t even had a surgery!!

I recommend and will be getting back any time i need to visit a dentist again. 100% trust! Thank you thank you thank you!</review>< Pics>

I never thought I would enjoy going to the dentist but I do now! I had severe anxiety over the dentist until I started going to Zen Dental. Dr. Alessandra is warm, kind, funny and smart but most of all, she genuinely cares about me and the health of my teeth. Since taking her directions on oral care, my teeth are in the best shape they’ve been in in over 15 years.
Since 2003, I’ ve had extremely  complicated health issues (PTSD, CRPS II/RSD, CTE, IP) which, along with side effects of my medications, have caused a serious deterioration of my mouth health over the years. Prior to seeing Dr. Alessandra, I was getting cavities every 6months, or less, on average and began needing root canals& crowns regularly. However, within 1year of going to Zen Dental, I had significantly less problems and within 2 years, I have not had any cavities! This is because I take her directions to heart. She knows what she’s doing and has created a safe, relaxing environment that is a huge help if you have severe anxiety like I do. I know no matter how I’m feeling going into my appointments, I will always leave with a smile. Seriously, I’ve never laughed so much at the dentist!
If you have anxiety, severe oral health issues and any kind of past dental trauma - Zen Dental will help turn that around for you. I know from personal experience!<//review>

<review>Overall, I am a fan of Kaiser. I live in Seattle and I am a member. I also used to work at Kaiser. Just a top notch experience overall. Two weeks ago, my parents were hospitalized with serious COVID symptoms. One was hospitalized at KP Sand Canyon in Irvine, dad. My mother at Anaheim. They were hospitalized in two different places because of two different medical incidents. My dad rapidly declined and passed. My mom was on the second floor unit also in decline. The second floor doctors, charge nurse, attending nurses were outstanding. Since the situation was dire and under extreme circumstances, I was allowed exception to visit them both throughout their stay. My mom was then transferred to the fourth floor.  Never have I been treated from any medical professional or hospital with as much disregard and hostility than that  floor staff (charge nurse specifically) ... That includes working at two hospitals --- including Kaiser.  Right now, since the care of my mother is still in their hands, I will not file a complaint till after she passes.

I have been given conflicting information about visitation and then blamed for following that conflicting information. I have been kept waiting between 45 minutes to an hour for escort to that floor or just making deliveries.  We have left messages, legit medical questions and inquiries, five or six times, with no call backs.  One particular incident was particularly traumatic. My sister called the charge nurse and asked if I could visit. The charge nurse told her that I could because mom was in end of life care. I got to the hospital 20 minutes later, went to the security desk, a security guard asked me what I needed, and I said, "I'm visiting a patient in the fourth floor." He directed me to the elevators. I thanked him. I got to the fourth floor and was confronted by the charge nurse, asking what I was doing in the fourth floor. I told her she had talked with my sister 20 minutes earlier and approved my visit. The charge nurse then denied having that conversation and asked how I got past security. I said I didn't, someone from security told me to come up. She then asked me to wait outside the unit. security then came up and asked me why I had bypassed security. I said I didn't. The guard then said, "I didn't give you approval," I said, "no, someone else did."  I then called my sister. She then called the charge nurse and the charge nurse denied ever talking to my sister. The security guard meanwhile escorted me out of the hospital. I then said, "my mom is dying and this is how I am treated." The security guard than followed me and  demanded to know how he treated me "wrong."  At that point, I realized, that I needed to placate, since the care of my mom is still in their hands.

I called the social worker on the palliative care team, who had ensured that she was an advocate for us, and left a message of what had happened. That was two days ago, no call back.

My mom's last days will be in the hands of the fourth floor. At this point, I fear any responses from me, any complaints, etc. other than placation could jeopardize her care.< /review>< Pics>

<review>Would it hurt to allow both parents into the NICU or at least for one to wait in the NICU waiting room? It's a daily stress for my wife and I when we go to visit our son, the security guards are inconsistent or have very little knowledge of the current Wuhan virus policy, Kaiser's own policy states "Special circumstances will be made for NICU patients" My wife and I tend to visit our son later in the evening, since we both work and have other children at home, all I ask is that she be allowed to wait in the NICU waiting room while we switch off in seeing our son. I don't like the idea of my wife having to wait in the car, at night in the parking lot.

Update: I spoke with a Kaiser rep and an accommodation was made.< /review><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>{'time': 1599414859922, 'text': 'Hi Kevin. We value and thank you for your feedback.

i went to parmacy and i was so disappointed with Kaiser. it is a nice place but I was scared. and my wife wanted to leave when we walked in.  they have lots of staff standing around but nobody is sanitizing anything. my wife is in the medical field and said that at her job they have people sanitizing and cleaning all areas, especially the high traffic areas like counter tops. when we left my wife said I am not about coming back here.< /review>

If I could give this place 5+ stars I would.

I've always been a big fan of Kaiser. I didn't get to be a Kaiser baby but all of my early care, teenage care and other needs have all been addressed by Kaiser because it's just easy. They have everything you need in house - a lab, pharmacy, and doctors for everything you need. You don't need to leave to get your stuff done anywhere else - it's all in house and that's why these facilities are so huge.

This is a newer location and so gorgeous - inside and out. There's a lot of parking, signs to point you where you're going, and friendly staff on the ground.

I was so impressed with how they handled things. Everything is computerized here. When a doctor comes to visit, they log it in a computer near your bed, then scan anything they give you - no charts, no paperwork - all technology. What's not to love?

Also the rooms are huge and spacious. They even have enough to give you your own room if needed but at an extra cost which is well worth it if you need that privacy.</Text>

I was very happy with the medical services when it was under Group Health.
Since Kaiser Permanente took over, everything went downhill! Unable to message doctors for questioning  except for the primary doctor only.  And was forced to change primary doctor without consent. When they have shortages on meds, they just send one month supply for a higher price without notification and make no attempt to put a back order in for later delivery. And, not even attempt to apologize for the mishandling of the matter! How rude!
I would shop for different health providers at renewal time.</review>

I have always been able to pay cash upfront for all appointments, $250. My beef, when I made the appointment last month, they said $250. Fine, no prices were changed.
This morning   , the woman who looks like she clearly does not wanna be there said $850. She had me waste my time with financial services, when someone could have notified me PRIVATELY that cash isn't a option anymore.
Now, miscommunication is fine from time to time. Don't waste my time when you send me four dam voicemails a week before, and have the wrong info at check in!!!!< /Review><date>1519237530048<//date><Rate>1<//Rate><Resp>None</Resp><UserId.>107845847940419857635< /UserId.><Name>Max< /Name></record></dataset><record>

Horrible! Staff! Horrible doctors incompetent and treated my mother like she was a piece of dirt. 7 hours with a nightmare staff. I screamed at them because they did not take care of my mother and they threaten to call the police on me. Yeah if she would of stayed they could have killed her. WRONG! Stay away from this untrained location. I have been in the UCLA Harbor and in the worst situations and let me tell you! Day and night to a rich bull neighborhood and can't take responsibility!!!!!!!  They would not help her dress! They would not help her put on her close! They did not help her at all! I had to call a lyft for her to get the hell out of this nightmare!<//text>

This is outside my normal healthcare network but we used the ER here a couple times because it was a close by hospital.  It was much faster than our usual hospital and the staff was awesome. Quickest ER trip we have ever had.</Text>

My son was born with gastroschisis there and the Dr. there were simply amazing . They took care of the surgery quick and he has had no problems . The person in charge talked to us and told us what they would be doing told us the guy doing the operation is amazing . How long it would take and updated us on everything .</review>

I hate coming to this Kaiser. they always take for ever to call you in and if your 5 or ten mins late they won't take you. I've never had a pleasant experience here. prepare to wait for upwards of 30+ mins before being seen. try going to another Kaiser!! run. run away.</Review>

< review>
My son - 8 years old - broke his arm on 3/19/15 and was seen by a doctor at Kaiser on 3/21/15 who decided against taking an xray of his arm.  The child was taken back 3/22/15 as the pain grew worse and at that point an xray was demanded and completed which verified the fracture.  The child was sent away again since there was not a radiologist nor a physician to see him.
We then started to make calls to the appointment help line to get our child seen and ended up having to drive to Mission Viejo - 30 minutes away and had to be seen there.  The child was seen and a temporary splint was put into place and we were told to call and schedule to have the cast put on by the pediatric orthopedics department on Monday.
Monday 3/23/15 we phone numerous times and are told it may be two to four weeks for our child to be seen for a cast as they only have one person that can do this.  As we were told by the staff the injury heals in 3-4 weeks on an 8 year old and at that point we are alarmed to hear that if the arm is healed improperly that the arm will have to be re-broken and reset.
We asked to escalate this as this is a ridiculous amount of time to wait and are told it will be escalated and the department will phone us no later than lunch time.  We wait until 1 pm and we receive no phone call and we start the process of contacting Kaiser again asking for help and are told that the case will be escalated and a case manager will be in touch with us in 8 - 10 business days ---two weeks.
This company has no business being in healthcare as they obviously do not care about someones health or well being an is willing to cause more pain to a child instead of finding a solution to their issues.< /review>

Waiting time is not regular, there are emergency department and inpatient department. There are orthopedics, oncology.

<Text>What an amazing place!! I felt like a kid in the toy section at Walmart 🤣 Honestly, I don't think I could even imagine an item used in the history of art that is not somewhere in that store. Awesome store all around though, for real 👏👏 oh and the guy working the graffiti-life counter was hilarious 🤣 I'll be visiting again for sure.<//Text><Rate>5< /Rate><Date>1623205418971<//Date><user>110116494758605378865< /user>< Name>

My favorite art supply store, as they have an incredible selection, so much so I drive from San Diego. Their prices are very competitive and when they have a sale, some awesome deals. All range of products from beginner level to advanced. Good parking, excellent friendly & knowledgeable staff.</Text>

<Text>Best place to buy anything honestly. The prices are fantastic, the savings are huge, and the staff is the friendliest and nicest people I've met. They're all pretty knowledgeable about their products and even the new people help with that. The store is always clean and the people who shop here are considerate and socially distance. They put in the best efforts to prevent the spread of covid-19. 100% would recommend.< /Text><user_name>Deborah Fernandez<//user_name>< Gmap_id>

I have been a returning customer of Art Supply Warehouse for almost 10 years now. It is a great place to get beginner and professional level artist supplies and materials. The store is great and usually well kept. The staff is the best part of the store, in my opinion. They really are great at customer service and genuinely know their supplies. Not to mention their teaching studio adjacent to the store- Catalyst. I applaud my old friend Dean(who still works there?) and I also applaud(Rebecca, I think that's her name) I applaud Rebecca for helping me troubleshoot an online on-demand class that I bought as a gift for one of my friends... Dean worked on the floor and I think teaches at Catalyst. This store is amazing... you will feel a "pick-me-up" by shopping here if you are an artist. So many things to inspire and talking with fellow artists gives a sense of community to all us art nerds. Keep up the great work you guys! I hope to shop in store soon!< /Text>

I love how big the store is, lots in variety in there which is great! I didn't catch their name but had amazing help from someone working in the printmaking section. Helped me find the custom paper they had and also went out of their way to find a tool for carving that they only had one of. Really appreciate that they went above and beyond to help me out.< /text>

This place has everything you can thing of regarding art supplies and they're accessories! Scratch board, canvases of many sizes, clay molding supplies, paint of any mediums, and many, many more. The customer service is very friendly and helpful. It's a large location, so prepare to become lost for a little-- walking the store itself is an adventure! Highly recommend.< /Review>

Holy Moly!!! If you need anything.... ANYTHING art related? You must go here. Every aisle, every section.... I found 2 mm leads for drafting I couldn't even find online. Seriously, this place is the absolute BEST STOCKED STORE for art supplies I have ever visited, and I've been to most of them. Art supply addicts... It's a must.<//Review>

The place is awesome and has a ton of hard to find items the big box stores don’t carry. They really do cater to the art enthusiast and the reward program is great. The reason for the 3 stars is because 1) the short haired manager is way too aggressive on the loss prevention stuff. If I spend $100 what makes u think I’m going to steal your clearance brushes, get real! Stop following me around the store, seriously. 2) the girl in the spray paint section...the one that looks like a haz mat worker with the gloves, the mask, and the glasses and face shield...yeah her; get some training on customer service. Every time I’m in there she acts annoyed when she needs to help get cans. Put them out on the floor then, don’t carry so many colors, or just put someone back there that’ll help and u can go stock the shelves and be happy! It’s the only place local to find these cans or i would probably go elsewhere. Yes, she’s that bad. Kick rocks and stop acting like your 50s hair is so cool.< /Text>

An outstanding art supply store. Anything you could need, you will find it here. Paper, pencils, pens, ink, clay, books, model making, and more are here. Even better, the employees are all helpful and friendly, and since many of them are also artists they can talk with you about projects. Classes are available if you want to learn a new skill, or pick up a how-to book or a kit. Whether you're brand new to art or a skilled professional, this is an amazing estsblishment.</text>

You can find about almost anything art related products here. From well known brands to not so well known. At a fair price. Would give this place a 5 star rating only if it had more model building supplies and paints.<//Text>

<review>I was worried this place would be packed, but I was able to find my item, pay for it quickly, and leave--a surprisingly painless experience in these painful times. Customer service was helpful and friendly and there were tons of neat little gifts lining the checkout aisles that helps me round out my holiday gift shopping.</review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

<text>It was my first time coming to this store and I happened to visit during the 25% off sale! I was so happy with my visit and so was my daughter. She loved her new children's easel with the dry erase board and chalkboard. I will recommend this store to everyone.<//text>< pics>

I have been going to Art Supply Warehouse for over 20 years now. They're simply the best. Best costumer service, best prices and most important best selection of everything from sketchbooks, brushes, canvas, paints, paper, etc.<//text>

Positive, helpful, and very informative staff. If what you're looking for is unavailable on their shelves, they will order it for you. ASW has an excellent website with many more products available that aren't in the store.</Text>

Let me start by saying, I love this store! It has every item, everything you need as an artist. Beginners to advanced artists, this is your home! I've ventured in different mediums, and each time I know I can find what I need for my courses. The staff is very knowledgeable about all the products and are artists themselves. They are not as pricy as other local art stores. This is an artist home, enjoy!<//text>

<Text>Could not believe that they had such a great deal on MOLOTOW spray paint
2 spray cans for $5.00 dollars. This deal also includes some IRONLAK's which were beige's and brown's. Also which were also part of this deal were transparent white and transparent black. Sole writers at a local yard told me about this place and the 2 for $5 deal so i came right over to see what colors were left. It turns out that alot of what was left are matte finish colors which i do prefer. The gloss colors that were available happened to be CHALK PAINT, which us temporary paint that is easily removed with water, something that I am not interested in buying. Overall, they have a huge selection of Graffiti spray paint and the prices are pretty reasonable.  The pricing really gets competitive the more that you buy. Starting at 5% off when you buy only a few and all the way up to 20% off when you buy a 20 or more cans. I was also really impressed with the huge selection of acrylic paint markers like UNI, POSCA, SHARPIE, MOLOTOW, MONTANA, etc. I would recommend this place to my friends, especially when they have these types of Clearance Sales like the 2 for $5 deal.<//Text>< pictures>

I was attacked by a female worker for having my mask only half way on when I had to take an important phone call. It was only on one ear.  I didn't mean any harm.
I was in the midst of putting it fully on too. But she verbally attacked and embarrassed me when I honestly was trying to put it on completely.</text>

No leg pain in my shop. Number one activity until they fired me they're taking girl to pick up a computer Christmas Eve. Her boyfriend got the job only lasting 2 weeks. Deception. Some people took off started making thousands of dollars a month . Others just did it for themselves their time in the mission. Incidentally nothing lasts that I can find. I try to do it the old-fashioned way. Like what I eat is coming from the Earth. A lot of things that is taking this country down there., like from the 1950s that's when they started putting detergent and things that we consume and use.

I live in Georgia and couldn't find a particular style ink anywhere in stock on my side of the country. After a relentless search I came across Art Supply Warehouse. I placed my order online and waited a few days to confirm my order, given this whole quarantine ordeal going. I had to wait a couple weeks from placing my order to receiving a package, but I want to personally compliment Mario, Gino and Owen for their attentiveness and eagerness to help! Owen confirmed my order, Mario confirmed what they had in stock and Gino shipped out my order. All three of them were wonderful to work with and I hope their supervisor sees this so they can get compensated cos these three gentlemen treated me with superb customer service and even worked with me on shipping since it took so long to fill my order. I received the items today 5/12 even though tracking said it'd be here on the weekend. My ink packs came in intact, sealed and in perfect condition. I will definitely be ordering from ASW again, even if it takes a minute to ship from one end of the country to the other. Again, a personal thanks to Mario, Owen and Gino! You guys are awesome!< /Review>

< review>
My nephew, a 1st year art student, and I recently went into Art Supply Warehouse with only a photo from his art teacher (no list). The picture was overflowing with supplies many of which were unfamiliar to the two of us. The only instruction seemed to be "get these items".

We were overwhelmed to say the least & likely we'd still be in the store today had it not been for the AMAZING customer service "above & beyond" excellence that we gratefully received from an employee on duty. Her name is Teren. She made our task fun! A scavenger hunt complete with economic sound advice and expertise. She LITERALLY availed herself as our personal shopper! Customer service A #1!!</review>

My nephew, a 1st year art student, and I recently went into Art Supply Warehouse with only a photo from his art teacher (no list). The picture was overflowing with supplies many of which were unfamiliar to the two of us. The only instruction seemed to be "get these items".

We were overwhelmed to say the least & likely we'd still be in the store today had it not been for the AMAZING customer service "above & beyond" excellence that we gratefully received from an employee on duty. Her name is Teren. She made our task fun! A scavenger hunt complete with economic sound advice and expertise. She LITERALLY availed herself as our personal shopper! Customer service A #1!!</Review>

<text>Over priced goods due to ease of access to the products. They basically have a monopoly on art supplies, as most other places do not carry what they carry.

Great place for art needs such as sketch pads, canvas, paints, pens, pencils, brushes and.other stuff. Great selection,  friendly staff. They offer a student discount so that saves you some money. I love this place. It's like an artist's candy store!!</text>

This is the best store to get your art  needs by far.  Hobby Lobby is a close second but to get high quality art supplies and items you can only get online, then ASW is the place to go.  Also, they have awesome customer service and everyone is highly knowledgeable on any question you may have.  I have lived within a mile of this place for over 35 years.<//Text>

<Review>It feels like an artist heaven and they have multiple kinds of artists working there so if I need help with a new medium, there is someone who can steer me in the right direction. It's got everything from diorama models to sculpting clay to airbrush machines. The book area has so many art books from modern artists as well so I can study more concept art and game art as well as different mediums. Screw Disneyland, this is my happiest place on Earth.</Review><gmapID>0x80dd28a70c97c5c3:0xea318d4aa8206870</gmapID><Pictures>None</Pictures>< rate>

This is an amazing art store that always has great deals and good prices. I see a lot of college students shopping here. Unless you're an artist with your own Gallery making tons of money, art supplies are not cheap so it's good to have places like this to support local artists trying to get ahead. You're not going to necessarily find the top of the top quality but really good mid-range stuff at bargain prices. If you're an aspiring artist please come support this place it's amazing</Review>< pictures>

< review>
It feels like an artist heaven and they have multiple kinds of artists working there so if I need help with a new medium, there is someone who can steer me in the right direction. It's got everything from diorama models to sculpting clay to airbrush machines. The book area has so many art books from modern artists as well so I can study more concept art and game art as well as different mediums. Screw Disneyland, this is my happiest place on Earth.<//review>

I wish I would have had more time to really explore. The artist in me didn't want to leave empty handed. We decided just to check this place out since we were in the area for a family event.</review></record></dataset><record>

The place to go to for all your art supplies!

I got (2) 18x24 canvases, (1) 12x12 canvas, (2) 8x8 canvases, (7) different brushes, (1) large oil color tube, and (2) medium oil color tubes for only $72!

Very friendly staff and great place to browse for fun too. They even had a selection of vinyl toys which are regularly priced but still fun to look at :)< /Text>

I dont know if its pandemic wise where people lost jobs where as going here to shop for art materials before this happened was no problem but recent visit, I could not put anything into my cart because the things I needed where pricey. I found the same exact things for 1.50 elsewhere brand and I was soo happy. I would travel from Whittier to my favorite art store. Last experience, we were rushed because "their was a line" and were asked to expedite our experience and felt rushed - we came out and there was hardly a line. When I needed help they didnt look at me to direct me, the employee was looking at something and told me the aisle. Granted I've been here plenty of times but what if this was my first visit, I would find this place unhelpful and not come back. I needed new paint and then I found great brands at Walmart for acrylic paint for 50 cents - this place is far for us anyway, we wont be coming back, great selection though!< /text>

I cannot get enough of this local treasure! Nice and knowledgable staff, cute "guard" dog, great stuff!

I shop her for all of my art needs, when I want to buy a pen or when I need to pick up a little gift. They have a tons of stationary, beautiful postcards and a surprising selection of varied art supplies.

Shop here often!!</review>

I love this place. It is always fresh and clean. The staff don't bother you but if you need help they are always nearby. They have a huge selection. I don't know how they fit it all in that little store. They now have a rewards club too. They always have flyers on events and classes. If you're into art culture this is definitely a place to check out. Honestly its the only place you should by your art supplies in Orange County. Everywhere else is overpriced and overrated.</Review>

<Review>Came here with my cousins and it was going good, shopping around for like 20 minutes finding my art supplies that I needed for school until a employee told me I had to take off my backpack cause he said they dont allow bags while shopping and then i look around and saw other customers with backpacks, bags, and fanny packs. I mean why tell me something when I was in the store for 20 minutes. He kind of forcefully took off my backpack without letting me take it off myself.

Sometimes it can be hard to catch every backpack or large bag at the door when guests come in to shop, but we make sure to do our best to implement the policy when we see them on the sales floor.\nWe will be sure to speak to our staff members about this issue and hopefully prevent this from happening again. We hope you accept our apology and give us a chance to make it right. If you have any other concerns, please email me directly at melody@artsupplywarehouse.com\nThank you,\nMelody'}</Response>

<text>Ive been coming to this place for years and it is a one stop place. I can get everything I could need and its also helped with me trying new products I may never have been aware of otherwise! The prices and deals are remarkable which is why its my top choice and the staff are super amazing. And if you ever come in with a large bag (purse or backpack) they will make you leave it at the front. I see no problem with this, Its understandable to prevent theft and such.<//text>< pictures>

Best kept secret with a great selection and terrific service. Shout out to David who gave my daughter the full tour aisle by aisle, showed us the studio nearby where they do the figure drawing classes and also have their art shows 😀 Let's see where her first art supply store visit leads her on her journey of loving and creating art ❤️< /Text>

It also has a variety of markers including Copics and Posca paint markers, as for the inks it has acrylic ink and ink for clothing, the watercolor section has lots of brushes and different kinds of paper. Overall the place was good for finding any kind of media and the staff was really nice, I definitely recommended this place. ❤❤❤< /text>< pics>

Fun local art supply store. Has a bevy of goods. Used to have the best bargains, but not so many now a days. That's the going trend everywhere. Lots of pens, markers, ink, colored pencils, so much fun. Hard to leave with just a single item< /text>

My favorite place to go. Not only is their service BOMB (literally everyone is so laid back and helpful) but their prices are UNBEATABLE! I literally go nowhere else for art supplies of any kind. I can't make myself clearer; art supply warehouse tops all.< /Text>

I love getting my art supplies here because the people are very helpful the staff is always walking around seeing who needs help and they always have a positive attitude.  I also like the fact that it's close to the freeway so I can get there pretty quick. They also host pretty cool events for people who love doing art all you have to do is ask.< /text>

Sleays a pleasure. They stock a variety of items at an affordable price. Theres nowhere else id rather go to get my art supplies. Customer service here is excellent. The staff actually knows their craft and their store. If they dont know the answer to your obscure question about whether or not this brand of lead will work under extreme heat without melting then they'll find you someone who does. Do yourself a favor though and bring more money than you intended. Because youre going to walk out of there with much more than you came in for.< /text>

<Text>Always a great place to find any art need. Need a new canvas, no matter the size they will most likely have it! Want some crafting tape? They will have you on aisle 4 for hours. The staff is beyond helpful and incredibly knowledgeable. The best part is the large homage to King Bob Ross.</Text>< Time>

<Review>Art Supply Warehouse is not only an institution, it is a fantastic place to pick up supplies at great prices.  It's not a huge place but they have so much to offer you know you are getting a good selection.  Super helpful associates, too.  I happen to live close but it is worth the drive if you live kinda far.  But be careful, you will want all the things!! ;)<//Review>< pics>

<Review>Best and sweetest staff there. I don't have a license and took the bus there. When I  realized I had bought heavy stuff, the employees offered a box to help carry my stuff to the bus stop. We quickly came to an idea of putting the small stuff in my back pack and carrying the big stuff by hand. Luckily there was a bus stop nearby and the employees still offer to help carry the big stuff. Now that is good Customer service. Best and sweetest staff there.<//Review>< response>

Very compact store but it has EVERYTHING you need for any art project! Staff is very knowledgeable about the products and they all seem to be artists too so they offer their own opinions and expertise. The prices are very good as well. Parking can be a challenge though</Text>

<review>This place is huge! I've been here 3 times, and I haven't seen even half of what they sell. I take my sister here to get very specific supplies for her college art class. The store is organized in a way that I can get in and out quickly when I have a supplies list.<//review>< Pictures>

<review>I've been to about 4 different states in the US and I have not found another art supply store like this! A definite must visit place when you're an art student/artist wanting a store dedicated to paints, canvases, lighting, portfolios, spray paint, and quirky/hilarious nick-nacks. Although few of their supplies have prices higher than Michaels you won't find another store w/ staffs knowledgeable in their field of art AND they got a cool point system where you get some money back when you buy from them!!!! *be sure to ask a staff member more about this system because I left some  important parts out to get the gist of it*< /review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

<name>Jeremy Littlefield< /name><Pics>None<//Pics><text>So this is not the cheapest place to buy art supplies but it's more of a quality store for mid-level to professional not to say they don't have entry-level stuff but it's all really high quality for the most part and casually they'll be a sale and you can get really great deals. We just purchased some paint pens into MM 4 mm they had various Brands to choose from including deco and the Brandy ultimately went with although I can't think of the name really good and that lot of colors too. If you're into spray painting or graffiti this is like the Megastore they have everything from gloves to spray can tips to Montana cans and the tips have all the classics like that dots pink dots Fat Boys etcetera</text><Resp>{'time': 1567638261502, 'text': "Thank you for the awesome review Jeremy!

< Review>
I discovered Art Supply Warehouse on a whim, by searching for an art store, hoping to find a real one. From the second I walked in, I found friendly faces and employees who (and I'm generalizing, I know) look like artists themselves (they are). After wandering around happily for I while, I sought help for my uneducated desire to give watercolors a try. I lucked out and got David, the manager, who went out of his way to assist me, from paint color choices to which brushes would be a good start.

I left happy (and supplied) and will go back again soon with my artistic kids. I highly recommend taking a trip here. You'll have plenty of brands to choose from and non-pushy help available if you need or want it. Please visit and help keep stores like these successful enough to stay open; there's just something wonderful about the scent of creativity you can't get online. (I mention this because the art store near me recently closed down, which is why I searched for another one—there really aren't a lot left).</Review>

Amazing store with everything an artist may need. From professional supply to kid toys/art kits. Price range is huge so any budget can shop here. Only thing is that during busy events you can't find parking here but have to park across the street by the movie theater/home depot.< /text>

Best and sweetest staff there. I don't have a license and took the bus there. When I  realized I had bought heavy stuff, the employees offered a box to help carry my stuff to the bus stop. We quickly came to an idea of putting the small stuff in my back pack and carrying the big stuff by hand. Luckily there was a bus stop nearby and the employees still offer to help carry the big stuff. Now that is good Customer service. Best and sweetest staff there.< /Text>

Art Supply Warehouse in Westminster provides that feeling and more, with a wide selection of art products are affordable prices.  The staff were also extremely helpful and made the store feel less daunting than it seemed when I first walked in.

The store is worth the drive if it is far from you, and if it is close by there is no excuse not to at least take a look around if you are an artist or aspiring to be one.< /Review>< Pics>

<Review>The staff was super helpful and friendly. They do what they can to make sure you're satisfied and will readily answer most questions you may have. They have all the essentials and then some for every artist. The level of specialized materials is also great. You won't find as varied of a selection of supplies anywhere else. Love this store.</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

They almost always have what I need at a fraction of the cost elsewhere. Plus they have cool crazy stuff by the registers. Sometimes I go there just to find a wacky gift.

<Review>Whether you're a hobbist or an up and coming (2D) artist, you can find the most extensive selection of tools here. Plan on being distracted for at least and hour.

The staff is helpful and very cool, with knowledge about pens, paints, and more. Ask them to recommend something, they want to help you.<//Review><UserId.>103766312003874681335< /UserId.>< rate>

This place is incredible! I go there whenever I need anything art related, and sometimes when I don't need anything at all, just to marvel at the possibilities. Supplies are limitless, and the prices are great. Visit just once and you'll never go anywhere else again!< /Review>

Yes, go here for all your art supply needs and wants. I think they work hard on keeping great prices rotating and do the best deals when school starts up. They all so have such a great detailed selection of a diverse range of mediums and media. It's fun to walk thru and really great for getting what you are looking for exactly.</text>

This store has the coolest stuff! I've been looking for Lazertran paper for a long time. Thought I was going to have to order online. Came here and they had it. This is a true art store where you find stuff you've never seen before. If you're into making masks or scary zombies this is your store. It has everything art related that your craft store doesn't have. Not much to look at from the outside but the inside is cool. The employees are very nice & friendly too</Review>

The best source for art supplies in Southern California.  Prices are great and selection is unmatched.  Hard to find soft pastels and sanded papers are in stock.  So much fun.....</Review>

I've been going here for a couple of decades. Definitely the best art store in the LA/OC area. They keep their prices down, they have all the art supplies you need, and have very helpful workers.</Text>

This store has the coolest stuff! I've been looking for Lazertran paper for a long time. Thought I was going to have to order online. Came here and they had it. This is a true art store where you find stuff you've never seen before. If you're into making masks or scary zombies this is your store. It has everything art related that your craft store doesn't have. Not much to look at from the outside but the inside is cool. The employees are very nice & friendly too<//review>

<Text>Huge selection of art supply for acrylic, watercolor, oil paints, screen printing, and more. Almost every size of canvas is available-even some unusual ones. Light boxes and easels. Tons of brushes labeled by purpose. Travel canvas and paper pads. Crafting paper. It's my go-to store! It's related to the Catalyst gallery/classroom/studio in the same strip.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

For all you creatives out there this place is it. All round great except for parking. Expect to fight dirty to steal a spot from a grandmother with the mini van. Bring the Brass if you want to survive.</Review>

Great place for gathering art supplies at a really good price. After doing comparisons online directly on the sellers site as well as comparisons to other brick and mortar stores, art supply warehouse seems to have some of the cheapest prices.
The staff is all very friendly and down to earth and knowledgeable.
It's conveniently located near a freeway as well.

The parking is a bit tight though and the lot is shared with a small strip and has a large incline driveway, though there are side entrances too.

I can't recommend this place enough for anyone who does any kind of art, from street art to studio art, they have everything you need!</text>

Awesome people. Sometimes I made a great purchases, comparable in price with online options for art materials. Good collection of professional acrylics (no Golden though), big containers of gesso for the best price I found (not the best, but good quality), and watercolor (decent price on Daniel Smith). I only wish they had deals on 100% cotton surfaces.</text>

It's always organized, clean, and well kept even on big sale days. I much prefer ASW over BLICK :)</Text>< Pictures>

<review>I've tried this place 3 times... If you have tattoos be prepared to have employees watching your every move. Sorry Art Supply Warehouse, you could leave your doors unlocked around the clock and I would never take something I didn't pay for. I'm  way above that. Needless to say,  I will never be back. I would not recommend this place to my enemies.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

Art supplies for pros, students and beginners.  Check, sometimes better prices online but, get it immediately at ASW.  Stock is sometimes low or gone but huge varieties.  Recommended!<//Review>

Such a great variety of art supplies and the store is pretty easy to navigate on your own.  Specifically I came looking for a floating frame to put a canvas painting in, and I was pleasantly surprised at the number of options I had to select from.< /Review>

<Text>It had just about everything a linoleum print maker would want. Large selection of inks at beginner to professional level, rollers and carving tools at good prices. It was a little lacking in the paper department, lots in the midrange and lie range but not as much for high end prints. Didn't see any zinc plates for that crowd.</Text>< Pics>

I tried for 6 months to buy a certain pouchade for my oil paints.  I already had one like it for my acrylics, and I knew exactly what I wanted.  It couldn't be found!  Working together, Justin (or Dustin, or both of them) and Ali found one for me and sent it on its way very quickly, and they were very polite, funny and diligent about it.  Thanks, Persons!  I am now a devoted customer.<//text>

<Text>It's the only place I go to for art supplies when I'm in need for great products, cheap/affordable prices, with great staff and nearly always in stock of what I'm in search for. I live in Downey and always willing to make the drive no matter what LA traffic looks like. This place is a must, wish there was more places like this for us artist. Nothing comes close. Sorry Michael's stores may look larger and have some things, but this place has it all. Must I say it again, go here, you won't be disappointed. 😊< /Text><response>None< /response>< UserId.>

If you are an artist, this is a great place to shop for almost any art supply you can imagine.  And the prices are better than most art stores.< /Review>

The one thing I can't stand is the fact that they have students and they're basically internships. I'm learning how to frame my own art and when I come in to buy materials, and want an opinion, help or I'm not sure what I want... because I'm new to this. they pull them away and say you are spending too much time with the customer? you need to come over here and stock? you need to go over there and do that? Well....I have a piece of advice for you all... especially the owner. the most important thing that you will ever teach these kids especially in an art supply is valuable customer service. if it takes 2 hours to help one person, you give two hours to help one person. you never know who they know, what they're going through and why they're there in the first place. Maybe they're sick, lost someone, maybe they help others and are time limited.. the last time I was in there... Was the very last. I was buying a book of archival paper, I needed help. I asked can you tell me... GAL interrupted " with a customer" as walking away. I said "absolutely no problem". She comes back, I'm holding a book in my hand looking at the specs on the front.. size thickness etc. she says to me rudely "I thought you said you needed help" huh? WHAT? Yeah I do... but don't hurt yourself..I SAID..I don't want your help now. go do what you were doing. just looking at something doesn't mean that I still don't need help! she literally turned and walked away, JAW DROPPED! So I just want to let you know AS I won't be back...I've spent $342.00 change in 3 trips within 2 weeks.  you have the most paranoid, lifeless, place of business. employees look afraid of helping a cust. Customers feel ignored, spend too much time looking for a few things on their own. Also.... I came in last summer with my daughter and I have a backpack, it's leopard non student looking... in the summer I use it as a purse.. we go to the beach, we go do things a lot and carrying a purse is not my favorite thing. I was asked to leave my backpack at the front counter? I said its not my backpack im a grown adult,it's my purse. they said well we need you to keep your backpack/purse up here at the cashier. WTH?  I have a question for you! why is it that I can't take my purse in your store, but you want me to trust you to leave my purse behind the counter with you? unattended by me the owner of the purse? I get it people steal but with your 596 cameras placed every 6 inches in the store, I don't think it's that bad... And I'm not coming back for 3 reasons.1 that you're teaching these kids its more important to stock things on the shelves that it is to help people. 2 anti trust issues having a person feel they can't walk in your store without first and foremost being looked at as a possible Thief. 3 lack of help buying the correct material. The archival paper book that I purchased I picked on my own it was correct after spending literally 45 minutes looking it up on my phone. the only problem I had with it was your rude employee and the fact that it was in a section that said it was $8.98 but I don't know when I got home I had spent $22 on it. More than half of what I wanted to spend or could afford to spend at that moment. Had that girl taking the time she would have been able to direct me to the correct paper still good quality but within my budget. I could go to Michaels Hobby Lobby and other places and find the stain items even online get better customer service in and out people who don't mind giving an opinion or the professional advice and spend less money. I looked at a matte cutter online and your prices were double for the same exact item your prices on this particular item were $9 more than Michaels you are not discount at all. I'm not an artist I like to create things and have fun and have a hobby. But I don't like being treated like I'm going to rip the place off simply because I have a cute leopard backpack. As a purse! come in and 15 things I need to frame I'm new, I need this, that and the other and the only one's helping are the interns pulled away to stock?No thx -$ 🖐️< /Text>

They also carry a huge line of paint supplies such as spray paint and airbrush supplies. The only down side I found is that they don't carry any automotive grade paints for airbrushing other that House of Kolor One Shot striping paint.

It is a really good store. Good people BUT sometimes they make mistake. Last time I asked them for a specific drawing pad but they gave me a wrong one. I didn't know the product otherwise I wouldn't ask them :)

Good store though<//Review>

I go here about every other week, and it lives up to its name!  There are plenty of art supplies stocked in the aisles, from graphite pencils to gouache paint, and their supply of art books (used and new) covers practically every art topic you'd ever want to study.  They also sell a wide variety of paper in all different colors, sizes, and patterns; their selection of fabrics and sketchbooks is worth taking a look at too.  This is the total go-to place for any artist, even if you're a beginner or a professional.< /review>

Ordered over $50 worth of mat boards on their website: waited two weeks before I had to email and remind them to fill the order.... When the mat boards finally arrived they were packaged horribly. No corner protection (which is usually standard for other online art supply stores), and all four corners of each mat I ordered were compressed and crinkled in transit. Basically had to trim a couple inches off each side to get clean corners.</Review>

If you find better pricing elsewhere you're always more than welcomed to ask for a manager to see if there is something we could do for you :)\n\nThank you very much again for the review, the continued support and helping us stay on our toes!

O M G!

If you are a paid artist, seldomly do art, want to be an artist or thinking about art, come check out this spot. They have EVERYTHING. Their selection is remarkable. They also have a lot of novelty items such as octopus finger erasers for example (lol).<//review>

<review>I'm just grateful this place is here. There is a somewhat similar art supply store in Long Beach, however the prices and the selection are no where near ASW. Keep up the good work ASW and I'll keep coming in to spend half my paycheck.

< Review>
I've had some pretty negative experiences with ASW. Recently, I ordered markers for my business and received a response they wouldn't be in until the middle of the month. When the middle of the month came around and I hadn't received the markers, I called and found out they wouldn't be shipped for a few more weeks still. I know unexpected things happen, but they should inform their customers about delays. It just seemed unprofessional and made them unreliable. I won't be shopping here anymore.</Review>

O M G!

If you are a paid artist, seldomly do art, want to be an artist or thinking about art, come check out this spot. They have EVERYTHING. Their selection is remarkable. They also have a lot of novelty items such as octopus finger erasers for example (lol).< /Review>

<name>Deborah Weinstein<//name><Time>1519570271756<//Time><Rating>5< /Rating><Text>ASW carries a very wide range of materials and tools used by artists and architect-type people.  Prices seem fair to me, probably competitive with Dick Blick, but you’d want to do your own price comparison for large-ticket items.  There is a gallery space called Catalyst in the same strip mall as the store that is operated by ASW and used as both a classroom and exhibition space.  A reception there for a juried art show was the actual reason for our visit.  The show was nicely presented and well lit.  I think that organizing and hosting shows is a very nice (and smart) thing for ASW to do for their artist-customers.<//Text>< pics>

This is the local art supply offering a large variety of products it's a good place, prices are slightly higher than average so u get less for your $, friendly staff, definitely worth checking out but go early weekends they close like 5:00 & weekdays @ 8:00pm, they ought to stay open you at least until 9:00pm everyday, thumbs up been going for years!< /text>

<Review>Pretty much a bad experience.  I ordered two colors, 25 of each of some paper.  It took a really long time to ship them (about two weeks).   On top of that, the link they emailed me for the tracking number was wrong and it was actually shipped a different carrier than the link/what they mentioned in the email.

Then when I received the items I was short 7 of one color and 12 of an other.  It ends up in the shipping notification email in one small little part they mentioned that 18/25 and 13/25 were shipping, but that's it.  No simple sentence saying something like "sorry, we couldn't complete your entire order and we're refunding some of your money for the partial order"

Then I contacted/emailed them via their website to ask about working on the full order of what I asked for and no response in over a week.

On their website they still list these items as available.  It seems they off to sell what they don't actually have.    I'm never coming back.< /Review>< gmap_id>

They're great but there are some things that are also at Michaels that is more expensive. Plus Michaels give out 50% reusable discounts every week. I like art supply cuz they do have a lot more stuff and the staff usually know what they're talking about</review>

All u can get for painting and drawing.  That only thing that I didn't like the service.  I walked the entire little store and not on person that could help.  Then found a girl and she was on her cell on a personal call.  I waited and when she finished her call I asked tldor the item I was looking for and she answered with an attitude that they didn't have it there.<//Review>

Either way you deserve a stress free environment and at ASW we pride ourselves in giving you the best service. We try to inform you of any current sales to give you options, but we tend to stay away from being pushy. If it was in our store, then it seems we may have over stepped some lines and we deeply apologize for the experience. Rest assured management was notified as an overview for team.\n\nThank you very much for your informative review and your support! We really wouldn't be here without you!"}</response>< pics>

I went in there to buy oil paints for my first time and they seemed very pushy when I kept telling him I only had a budget that kept trying to to soda push me into buying today's the last day you can buy this and I didn't like the sales pressure I prefer Art Supply Warehouse.<//review>
