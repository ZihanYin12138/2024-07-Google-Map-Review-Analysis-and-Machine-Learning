<text>Brett and his team communicated well with me throughout the process keeping me up to the most current date with the loan process.

Brett made himself available day and night to answer any of my questions. He made understanding documents and numbers on forms easy. I am happy with the customer service I received. Brett and his team did an excellent job. I would recommend Brett and his team to my friends and family.</text>< pics>

<Text>I worked with Eddie Rea at loanDepot and he made the process smooth from start to finish. Eddie is honest, upfront, personable, and knowledgeable and I trusted him completely throughout the escrow process - and even before entering escrow he was really helpful and took the time to answer my questions. He explained everything to me thoroughly and took the time to really listen to my questions. I would HIGHLY recommend Eddie and loanDepot.<//Text>< time>

Eddie has been wonderful to work with. His response time is lightening fast, he is honest, transparent, listens, and is highly knowledgeable!

<text>Javier was awesome!  He kept in constant contact with us even when he was on vacation!    This is the 3rd or 4th loan we've had with Loan Depot. I thought the first time was great but every time the process gets easier and easier.  I loved the hybrid process for signing loan docs.  We had a couple hiccups in the process but your reps jumped to address our concerns.  I have referred my sister  and son to  Loan Depot and my sister just signed Escrow yesterday!

<text>Compared to other financial institutions , that tend to be intimidating and dismissive.
The team that worked with me had an open line of communication , courteous, and friendly, as if they genuinely had my best interest in mind. I got to say that was the best part that we were on the same page during this whole process, making it so smooth and stress free.

I believe Jeanne Ball and her team, was exemplary, I couldn’t ask for more, I am extremely satisfied.<//text><Pics>None</Pics><response>{'time': 1616436106953, 'text': 'Hi Paul Beye!

<review>From my first interaction with Natalie, she just has this very welcoming and calm demeanor. She was so patient and very knowledgeable on the entire process as it was our first time buying a home, let alone, a new build. Natalie was very responsive via text, call, and email and set expectations clearly on communication.

She even took an hour of her day to walk us through our loan documents, highlighting the most important things as well as addressed our questions. Extremely happy with Natalie!</review><GmapID>0x80c3350996b5678b:0x1809583e6a5b036c</GmapID>< response>

From the beginning of the loan process everything has been done smoothly. Jeanne has been so helpful with the loan process. She has gone beyond her will to answer all my questions. She is always professional and has responded to all my emails and calls in a timely manner.  Overall, Jeanne made this experience easy for me specially for been a first-time home buyer.

She provided precise, specific instructions that allowed me to assemble exactly what was needed with ease. She provided answers and advice usually within minutes, not hours or days. Early in the process she actually anticipated a couple of questions and concerns on my part and proactivlely addressed them. Often in the past resolving issues meant endless voice mail chains and ambiguous instructions that had to be revisited over and over. As always, there were last minute requests or clarifications from underwriting and these were addressed and resolved quickly and professionally without the sense of crisis I've experienced with others.</Review></record>

The process didn't go as easy as I thought.  I wouldn’t recommend loanDepot to anyone because the whole experience was to stressful and there were too many bumps on the road.   The loan officer was helpful at first but not honest towards the end of the process. I feel customers are deceived in believing that they will getting the incentive offered at first but at the end it benefited the company and/or the loan officer.  Documents were not sent in a timely manner.  I was asked to sign documents with prior dates and with figures that ended up changing at the end.  Very unsatisfied customer.  People should research this company before using them.</text>

<text>Left it one star only because they didn't have -10 stars.  This was a fiasco and, I felt, a total scam.  The person I dealt with was gung ho about all the things he could do for us in refinancing our mortgage - the low interest rate, the lower payment, no PMI - and sent me a loan estimate to prove it.  Even low closing costs. Ended up with two more loan estimates with $230 to $290 in PMI and $14k in closing costs with NO COMMUNICATION. I left messages, I texted the loan officer, I emailed, I called his manager and I called his manager's manager.  I got nothing for 3 weeks until I eventually called their customer service line and complained.  STAY AWAY FROM THEM!<//text><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>{'time': 1584030804436, 'text': 'Hi C.l.

< Review>
Got my haircut here for the first time. I am very impressed.  They are very friendly and welcoming. The shop is very clean.  This is probably the best barber I've had since moving to Glendale. I showed him a picture of what I wanted, he looked at it quickly and nailed it.  Thank you 😊<//Review>

<review>Excellent service! This barber shop is high quality without the high price tag. I like that I gave minimal directions and yet I loved the haircut. They vacuum your head for those annoying little hairs!! Never had that done to me before and it saves you from getting hairs everywhere. The neck massage before the shave was nice too.<//review>< Resp>

I got a haircut here and the barber is oriental and apparently doesn't speak good English as he misunderstood what kind of haircut I wanted and cut too much.</review>

Called to make an appointment, made it on time and was seated right away. Place is very clean. Told him what cut I wanted and VIOLA he got it just the way I asked him to do. Now, I found the Barbershop I'm gonna visit once a month.< /Text>

I frequent this shop since it was located in the same parking lot as the Big Square market in Pacific Ave and when it used to be HK Market. Since 1998, it went through at least three different barbers. Even through different barbers, the shop provided and continues to provide consistently good men's haircut.< /Review>< Pictures>

He’s a great barber with very affordable prices. I have thick Asian hair and I have to say he knows how to cut it quickly, efficiently, but with a good eye for detail. The fact that he is able to do a fade with scissors is great as well as many barbers don’t know how to do this, and it definitely leaves a more natural look in the hair as it grows out. Prices are very affordable as well for $15 for a basic haircut, and $17 for haircut plus shampoo as of June 2018. I’m not sure if he does more extravagant styles you may find at fancy salons and $40+ barbershops, but if you want a no-frills, neat, well done classic haircuts, this is a great shop to visit.

Side note: he doesn’t speak English all too well, but as long as you are patient, and bring in a picture to give an idea of what you want, you’ll be in good hands.</review>

I'm extremely happy with my choice to come here! This guy's ability to shape and fade with scissors is impressive. They also clean up neck/sideburns with a razor which makes for an altogether exceptional cut @ $15.<//text>

If you don't speak Korean, don't expect much small talk from Mr Choi or his wife, but you'll not find a better haircut. Very professional, good price ($15), walk-in welcome, full service barber. Never been disappointed.< /review>

Went in early on Sunday because they were open which was nice since Most barbers are closed on Sunday.   On to the haircut, the barber is precise with scissors and then uses the trimmer to complete a mens fade. They also vacum your hair clean. I paid the extra 2 bucks for the shampoo. They also clean your ears with a q-tip and give you a quick massage and you're good to go.  I would definitely come back. 5 stars!!<//text>

I do love me some jersey Mikes and the two young women who were there in the late morning on 4/26 were super nice. I got a B.L.T. (not for me) and a Big Kahuna (for myself). The store was clean and it looks like they do a lot to keep the store clean. I would recommend this location to anyone in need of a good sandwich.< /review>

<review>Another great Jersey Mike's.  The food was delicious and was worth the wait.  Not really a line but it did take a few extra minutes to get our sandwiches.  Maybe they were new.  Parking here is limited and same with the dining room seating.   But the food was fresh and tasted delicious.< /review>< Time>

Sorry the 1* review was meant to be a 5* review. The experience was great, I told them exactly what I wanted, what I didn't want on my sandwich, and got a drink. The cashier rung up my order as a Regular instead of a Giant, and they appreciated my honesty. In general, they have often got my orders right and I have never had an issue. That day had an issue, but it got resolved quickly.<//text>

Overall experiences with Jersey Mikes have been good, but today I realized the confusion that comes to the employees when making pickup orders. I ordered two separate orders with the same name from the app. Both were completely different orders. When i come my first order is done but not the second. I ask them about it and they say that someone took the second order so they have to remake it. They begin making it hastily but I did not get to clarify with them what was on the second order before they started. When i brought it home they had given me the same order as the first one which was a tuna sandwich, chips and soda, but i didn't get a chance to tell them the 2nd order was completely different. I had ordered a Big Kahuna Chicken sandwich. Sad to say, I did not get my Big Kahuna Chicken today.<//text>

<Text>Jackie and Jacob (sorry if that’s wrong spelling) we’re so friendly once I came in, they greeted me with a warm hello. They both were cleaning and preparing their stations, the phone rang and Jacob says “got it” and Jackie said thank you as she was sanitizing the counter before preparing my order. They had great communication while multi tasking. Jackie made my sandwich quick and with ease. She offered other options as I requested avacado and reminded me that it was a little extra (which I knew but still). Then came checkout, I told her I had shore points but another phone number linked to it, she then checked with Jacob to see if we could transfer points to the new number I want to register. AGAIN, their communication and teamwork shines! I told her no worries I didn’t have much points left but she was willing to find out how I could do that (online tech support that Jacob gave me the number for :) ). These two made my visit incredibly pleasant in these crazy times. The store was organized and clean. Overall these two cannot be stopped, GREAT SERVICE!< /Text>< pics>

<review>I came in today for the lunch rush and there were 3 employees working and I have to take a second to call out this amazing employee (akira- I’m sorry if I spelled it wrong) she might as well have been working alone. She was the only one hustling and she moved doing the grill and picking up the slack of the other two (boy with glasses and blonde girl) it was so hard to watch as those two moved slowly and looked confused the whole time, honestly this location needs to do better, it used to be so quick and now people are waiting a long time for their food all because they hire kids like those two. Anyway I gave it a 5 star because akira made my subs so well and I just felt bad for her.</review><gmapID>0x80dca71720d1ddf7:0xc544819a9fd6a6a0<//gmapID>< user>

Placed an order for pick up and not only did they get the sandwiches wrong they also forgot to include several side items we paid for. When we called them their solution was for us to drive all the way back for replacements. The store is far away as is, and driving there twice because they failed to complete our order correctly is not a reasonable solution. I wish they would have just gotten the order right to begin with. All we wanted was to enjoy our incredibly expensive meal but now we can't even do that. Won't be returning here.<//Text>

<Review>I give a star because the food was edible.  Waited 30 min for an online order. 4 employees, 2 looked really busy, 2 stood around a lot, as if they had no idea how to do anything else besides what their station required of them. Poor cleanliness and sanitation of work stations. Poor organization of orders and sandwich making. No courtesy. No customer service.</Review><response>None</response>< rating>

<Text>This was my first time coming here and let me just say, this place is amazing! The girl at the counter with the pink hair was so sweet and had a really great attitude, she gave me suggestions when I said it was my first time coming, I ended up with a chicken cheese steak and my friend had an Italian sub, a young man with glasses put the toppings on the Italian and my friend loved it. I didn't get either ones name but they both were so kind and helpful. I will be returning soon!<//Text>< pics>

< review>
The service was average, finished my sandwich before asking me if I wanted any extra toppings like tomato or peppers including your vinger and oil, the first lady that prepared my food was horrible service, the second lady did a great job and put my toppings on as I wanted after it was wrapped, the second lady told me the first lady assumed what I wanted on my sandwich  with no toppings because that's how most people like it. Other than that it was a good meal before going to class on a Thursday around 4:30 PM.<//review>

<text>Love this place! I would’ve given it 5 stars, however there is an employee that was just rude! First off, none of the workers had name tags to start off with. In the Jersey Mikes off Iris, there was an employee who had her hair dyed blonde with some color in it and she was on the thicker side, I would give a name but like I said, they weren’t wearing any name tags. I asked to have my sandwich cut into 3 pieces and placed together like a whole sandwich, not wrapped individually. She was not friendly at all and complained to the other worker right in front of me because I didn’t want to have the 3 pieces wrapped separately. I wanted it the way I wanted it. What is the big deal if I want it placed together? Don’t like it, work somewhere else 🤷🏻‍♀️ However, thank God the other employee was very kind, too bad neither of them had name tags< /text>< userid>

I love sub sandwiches. While their selection may seem a little bit less than other places, it's not true. They'll merge sandwiches, add and custom them, and their food is FRESH. Man, I just crave their spicer chicken subs, this place is delicious. Fast service with great staff. SUPER CLEAN location.<//text>

Generally I am completely satisfied at Jersey Mike's.  This trip  not so much. There was only one person working the counter when I walked in. Eventually another employee came out from the back but seemed oblivious to the customers waiting. He eventually called to a third employee in the back and she eventually came out and took her time getting busy. I get far better service at the Riverside store and even though the Moreno Valley store is only a few blocks from home, I will travel there if this store doesn't shape up.< /text>

Enjoy the food very much the 99 is my favorite which is a combo of a Philly cheese steak sandwich with jalapenos and chipotle mayonnaise on it 😋 PS the staff is outstanding very helpful and very friendly.
GOOD EATS!!! I personally go there at least twice in a month and order 3 giant sandwiches each time ☮</Review>

<text>My husband and I are season ticket holders for USC and we've ordered sandwiches from there for the last 3 weeks and not one of them has been right! Not only not right, but they were so drenched with oil, one of my usc shirts had to be soaked before I washed it. Teach your employees to make the food the way they would appreciate it. And offer napkins!!<//text><name>Dianna Fortie<//name>< user>

<username>JNQ<//username><date>1491865525285<//date><Rate>5< /Rate><Text>4/10/2017:  An outstanding service provided by the team working this location.  Not only did we get outstanding service when we ordered our meals, but the team is one of the most honest I have encountered.  I forgot my iphone when my friend and I were eating there, and after a couple of hours I noticed I had lost it.  I called the them back to verify if I had left my iphone there, and they confirm that they had an iphone and I could go pick up and verify if it was the one I had lost.  I went back to the location, and the team asked me to opened it to verify it was mine.  I did not catch all their names, but a young lady that works there apparently found it and turned in.  They are the most honest and nice people I have encountered at a fast food location.  Thank you guys for the integrity and honesty, as well as being the nicest people I have encountered.  Enclosed is a picture of two of the 3 outstanding workers/citizen that assisted me.  The female that found the phone unfortunately is not on the picture, but also deserved great credit for doing the right thing.  It's great to see there is still outstanding and honest people in this world.  Thank you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  JQ.<//Text>< Pictures>

So much yum! I love that they give you so many pickles n things with your meal. Our server was a dear. Their hours are kinda frustrating, as they actually close from 2:30-5pm, so be warned, no late lunches! And if you want those veggie pancakes, get there before 6:30 or they might have run out!< /text>

This place is obviously one of the most attractive place in the region. Whenever I go there I am incredibly satisfied. They hold their very high  level service and the highest level of food  they provide. You can never go wrong with this restaurant. Very  recommended.</text>

We love Hi Tofu, because it's a quaint restaurant but with really friendly service. We always get the tofu bowl, and just enjoy going in and having a delicious meal. The ladies who work there are always so sweet to my son, and it's part of the reason it's one of our favorite places in Temecula to eat.<//Review>

Terrible foods and no service and a somewhat obscure location with a bad sign deserved 0.5 rating.

Very disappointed. Went there at 7pm. They couldn't take my husband and I because they only had enough food for the  catering. The least they could have done was to say" please come back and here is a coupon for buy one get one ". They lost a good customer. We would drive to San Diego than ever go to HI Tofu. Good Bye Tofu !!!. You deserve 0 star.< /Review>

Asolutely delicious!! The food was fresh and the vegtables were awesome tofu was the perfect texture !!! The Mushroom Tofu soup was AMAZING and he took into account that I was vegan and did the rest without me having to ask them to take out too many ingredients! The mushrooms were fresh it was so good will definitely come back<//Text>

I am very happy  to found a korean restaurant in Temecula.  It has very convenient location next to Walmart shopping mall in Temecula.
All food was great,  especially soon tofu and chicken teriyaki.  Great service and good price. Try example of all Korean food here.
I guarantee it!!!<//Review>

The taste is good, traditional Korean food, the price is reasonable, but you need to wait some times, no fast as fast food shop.<//Text>

<Text>Summary: Because of the grand review on Yelp I decided to give Hi Tofu a try. This place was a little hard to find, it was tuck in the corner somewhat on the side of La Cocina Restaurant.

Foods: Korean Style Veggie Pancake, Hot Stone Bibimbap, and a spicy Seafood Soondubu (which according to Hi Tofu Menu is just: Tofu Soup).

The Veggie Pancake was very bland and oily, I don't understand how the reviewer speak so highly of it. The sauce for the Bibimbap was a non spicy flavorless paste and anyone with experiences should know that the sauce is the main ingredient which completes the Bibimbap dish. As for the Soondubu (or Tofu Soup), I was devastated. The silken tofu was completely unseasoned and uncooked, which is... unacceptable. And why were there jalapenos in my Soondubu? If you call this place you run authentic then you shouldn't be adding JALAPENOS.

Service: The old lady (whom I assume is the owner/relative) was very kind at first but became hostile when I told her how the cook should use less oil for the pancake, jalapeno should not be in the soondubu, and the kimchi should be fermented a bit longer.

Overall: Maybe, just maybe when I can no longer drive myself to Korea Town in Orange County, I'll give this place another try. But for now, I'll stick with Kaju in Garden Grove as my go to authentic korean food.<//Text><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

< review>
(Translated by Google) I have a bit of a misfortune about Sundae. I feel like Kimchi stew. Bukchang-dong Sook-boo If you think about it, you might be sorry. Note please

Friendly service is good

(Original)
순두부 조금 아쉬운 점이 있어요 김치찌개 같다는 생각이 듭니다. 북창동 순두부 생각하고 가시면 아쉬울 수 있어요 한국 사람 입맛보다는 현지 입맛에 맞춘 듯 합니다. 참고하세요

친절한 서비스 좋습니다< /review>

(Translated by Google) I ate some soft tofu and ribs, but the taste is not good at all, and the amount of ribs was very different from BCD.

Very efficient and professional. I have been going there for 3 years and i haven’t had one complaint. The work is very adequate and the staffs are very polite. I recommend asking for Sabina. She’s very respectful and great at doing eyebrows👍< /text>

I don’t really do threading and stuffs but when I do, I really want it to be perfect. Just tell them how you want your eyebrows and you’ll get it. If you want perfect, this is your place. And also extremely humble staffs. Loved it.< /Review>< UserId.>

<text>Just wanted to take a moment and thank Sabina for taking care of my eyebrow. I'm very particular about my eyebrow because it's very light colored and I've thin hair.I don't trust anyone but ladies from Eyebrow Threading. I had a very thin eyebrow but wanted to grow it thick beautifully. Steps by steps leaving some hairs to be grown for the shape I wanted,They exactly knew what they were supposed to do.Now I can leave my brow natural without using any eyebrow pencil.It's thick as I wanted. I've been doing my brows with them ever since I moved to California. Quick service,friendly Staff,good price.

Thank you for the service ladies. Highly recommended!!!</text><Gmap_id>0x809add6b64602e35:0x7cd9f371fdc1891a</Gmap_id>< Pics>

<text>This was my very first time trying threading, and it was a great experience! The environment was calm and nice and open. The lady was very nice! I got my whole face done - I am a natural light blonde so I have lots of fine hairs ALL OVER my face. I posted before & afters and you can see all of my little hairs are gone! :)< /text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOlQ6xtdAfOgsw2FwxzxmL0_PRPGyBNPdqBg2iQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO03L3dDqSRxJWAePomMQyunmwI3f2aOpwm_81p=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics><Resp>None</Resp>< Gmap_id>

<review>Never like to leave bad reviews but I'm highly upset with quality of her work. BECAUSE IT COSTED ME MY EYEBROWS! It was my first time so I had anyone do them thinking they all had a good work. I told the lady THICK, because I had been growing them out for a month. When I saw the finished product I almost cried. I would not RECOMMEND this place if you want thick eyebrows!<//review>< time>

<Text>I was so mad!!!!!!!! I have been there a couple of times. Its a hit and miss with these people. I was happy the at first then on my last visit I think she made a mistake instead of telling me she just made my eyebrows super thin! I have been growing them out and was finally at a point where I it looked good with out filling them in. I asked her why so thin she didn't answer. I asked her what dose a touch up mean? Why would I come in with thicker brows and want super thin without telling you? I will not go there again and it smells weird too!< /Text><user_name>Tiff Timberlake< /user_name>< response>

I thought the saying goes that you get what you pay for! So I took the 8000.00 plunge buying a arose Gold Chainlink bracelet for which I sent back to the manufacturer early March because I noticed the clasp was loose and the bars inside ad a bend to them. I wore this two times because I am athletic and in the pool daily so could only wear it going out. I purchased this expensive item for my birthday in August 2020. It’s 7 months old. I requested a replacement and communication with this company once it was received at the repair center of theirs. I only received an email confirming that they got it back. No calls at all, holding onto a very expensive item of mine with zero communication and resolution. I was planning on buying the same bracelet in 18k gold this year but based upon this experience, I would never purchase again from Tiffany-it’s hugely expensive and at the very least they should offer impeccable customer care and they really don’t through the 800 number. Going into the store is great but getting things done through corporate and their 800 service is such a joke. They are the most expensive game in town-they should do better.
Update! If it wasn’t for Keith at the Pasadena store location, I would never purchase from this company but he makes everything better with his impeccable customer service bending over backwards to help his clients! Love Keith at the Pasadena location!!!!< /text>

<Text>I had to stand, wait, browse and then ask for someone to help me, probably because I was returning and not purchasing. But the clerk was nice in a condescending way.

I brought in for inspection a charm purchased on eBay that I suspected was an imitation.  The manager assisted graciously and assuaged any fear I had of being duped by attesting the validity of the piece and complimenting me on the purchase and then going above and beyond by not charging me for an O ring so I could attach it to my bracelet, even giving me a little blue drawstring pouch for my goods! What a class act and proof that the Tiffany name still stands for outstanding service and quality.< /review>

I love the little blue store! My sister is about to turn 16 so I wanted to get her something special so I went to Tiffany and found this beautiful necklace that really wasn’t too expensive (at least compared to some of the other items they sell there). I can’t wait to give it to her because I think she’s going to absolutely love it! Thanks you to the amazing staff for the help too, even if it was just a small sale!< /Review>

Tiffany & Co. has very nice and helpful employees. From the door man to the sales reps, they're never to pushy, snobby or impatient. The item I got was a gift for a close friends birthday and even though they were temporarily out of stock, my sales person called and the signature Teal colored box was waiting for me in perfect time.< /Text>

Came in looking for rings. Melissa was incredibly kind and helpful. Though they didn't have what we were looking for, she genuinely wanted to help us on our ring search rather than simply trying to make a sale. Tiffany may be overpriced compared to your local jewelry store or cousin who has that connection in the diamond district, but you're paying for service and here they've got it.</Text>

First visit and I loved it ❤️ went there on a lunch break. Due to Covid 19 had to wait outside but the wait was brief and someone would come out  to let  you when it was almost your turn. Transaction was quick but not rushed. I will probably come back again.< /text>

The customer service at this Tiffany’s if horrible. I bought a ring during quarantine and I couldn’t exchange it during that time, so I called this Tiffany’s because they have my size available. Well the girl that “helped” was not helpful at all. She said I couldn’t exchange it anymore even though the stores have been closed. I asked for a supervisor and I was told they were unavailable. She pretty much said that I was stuck with the ring that is too small. Horrible service. I actually expected more from them.</review>

<Review>I wanted to return the Tiffany necklace my friend gave me for Xmas gift because I already have the same one.  I went to the Tiffant &Co in Pasadena, CA and told the sale associate that I want to return the Tiffany necklace.  The store associate misled me by saying they can only issue store credit for the return.  I was suprised with her answer because most stores in America accept returns within 30 days of purchase in the form of original payments except final sale items.  Then I told her " no I don't want store credit because my friend paid this necklace with cash".  Then the sale associates misled me again by saying if my friend paid it with cash then I have to bring my friend to the store for the cash refund or they can only send the check to the original purchaser's address.  Wow! this person intentionally falsifying the store refund policy because with the cash purchase the receipt doesn't show the name of the purchaser nor their address.  How would the store know the name and address of the purchaser so they can send the refund check to?
I can just simply ask my friend to send me the receipt and bring to the store for cash refund right?  This sale associate gave me a false statement about store refund policy by misleading me from store credit to refund check being sent to purchaser's address to having to bring the purchaser to the store with me for cash refund.
when you read this review remember to watch out for these tricky and stealing acts of TIFFANY & CO sales associates!
They are BAD.< /Review><time>1577660651873< /time>< Resp>

Walked in to choose a birthday gift for myself. An Asian lady walked to me and asked me if I wanted something very rudely. I wanted to try on a silver ring. The employees were pretty busy talking amongst themselves and ignored me. The blonde woman with long hair was very nice and so was the very tall gentleman at the entrance. When I did get to try on a ring, the same Asian woman from the beginning, told me to tell her if I wanted a different size again, very rudely. So, I took my husband to buy me a gift somewhere else. This is not the first time I have had issues at the Tiffany stores.< /Review>

Amazing, the team there has been so helpful. Went with my sister to drop off some pieces to get cleaned, picked those up for her and dropped off a piece I needed to verify if it was real or not, and they were nothing but nice!</Review>

<review>I have been shopping at Tiffany's for the past 10 years.  I have never had such a horrible experience in my  life. For mother's day, I originally went to the Glendale location because we were having dinner near by, I purchased something there that I ended up sending my boyfriend to return it in Pasadena. This time around I sent him with ALL my jewelry to get polished, and 2 necklaces to get sized. Pictures were taken with instructions as to what needed to be done, as to not confuse him nor the sales reps. He was first assisted by a helpful associate who them handed him over to Mrs. Y. WANG. She completely ignored all instructions as far as replacing the item being returned. I specifically asked for a 22 inch necklace and she went ahead and ordered a 16 inch and told him, "Its ok she has lot of necklaces she can use on that charm." She then waved him off to the repairs section without letting anyone know he needed assistance. He was asked several times if he needed assistance with sales, but explained he was there for polishing...30 minutes later someone appeared and apologized because they had not been informed. When my boyfriend explained his whole ordeal, they again sent him back to Mrs. WANG who was too busy to correct her error because she was having an espresso with a prestige client. Today I received my necklace in the mail...and it is STILL the wrong size! After already having been charged for alterations I'm still something I didn't order. Never shopping there again. Going to start shopping small business from now on.< /review>< Date>

This Tiffany has been my go to when I need to shower my wife with affection. The staff is always attentive and helpful. With Tiffany, the timeless designs they are known for seem like money well spent to me. I like the silver pieces for small gifts. I bought a wedding and engagement ring through another Tiffany and the service they give my wife when she goes to clean and polish it is top notch. Tiffany offers that service for life for no cost other than the premium you pay when you purchase. I'm very happy to be a Tiffany customer.<//text>

<Date>1512970916856< /Date><Rate>1</Rate><Text>Hello and welcome to my review, I’ll try to make this short and sweet. I have no interest in Tiffany & Co. or their products, but I do have interest in the happiness of my friends. What does my friends happiness have to do with Tiffany and Co.? Well if you bring your attention to the review below this one of “BLuna Snaps”, my friend was publicly humiliated at this Tiffany and Co. location. Was it because of the color of his brown Mexican skin? Or the fact that he has the face of one under 18? Either way I’m not happy. Now I understand Tiffany and Co. is a classy establishment who likes their stores to maintain a certain look and my friend was carrying a skateboard and backpack, but he was still a paying customer. Tomorrow I plan on getting to the bottom of what is going on there, I’m going to get on my friends shoulders and we’re gonna put on a long trench coat to look like one adult because adults are tall. Thank you for reading my review, Coco 10/10.< /Text>< pics>

<Text>After having a good experience buying a bangle online for mother's day, I decided to visit this store to purchase a gift to my father in his day. Unfortunately, I met Mrs. Y. Yuan. I asked her for a pendant, she showed me it and I decided to purchase it. I asked her if the pendant was brand new, because I saw some scratches in there, she said yes and those scratches that I saw were only "fingerprints". I don't know why, but I trusted her, and as soon as I got home I gave the pendant to my father. When he opened the box and tried the pendant, he realized that the pendant had scratches. The "fingerprints" were actually scratches. I ended up returning the pendant and buying one online. I was basically mocked that day.<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

< Review>
I visited Tiffany to purchase a necklace as a christmas gift, and my experience here was not an enjoyable one. Upon asking to see the necklace I had in mind, the woman helping me, rather than allowing me to see it the first time I asked, told me the price instead, hinting I may not have the sufficient funds to purchase it. After paying with my card, I was prompted by the woman to enter my information into their computer while she went off to wrap my gift. As I entered my information, I was approached by two angry female workers who asked me if they could "help me with anything" in a demeaning manner. Astounded, I searched for the woman helping me to prove that I was a customer. Without an apology, the two female workers continued on as if the confrontation never even happened. I left the store with a Tiffany blue gift bag, but no dignity. I'm not sure whether it was my 16 year old age, my Mexican race, or both, but all I can say is that shopping at Tiffany's wasn't the experience that I expected from a luxury jewelry retailer.<//Review>

I went here to grab a last minute Christmas and the service was terrible I understand you let your guard due to the busy season but I felt like I was in a Zale`s or another low end jewelry store, disappointing ! I waited over 30 minutes with many employees just standing around and the associate that assisted me ( i use the assist loosely ) she could not even tell me the size of  beads I wanted to purchase and this is why retail is dead, next time I will just buy online.< /Text>

<Text>What do you need to say other than it's Tiffany. I did notice they had beefed up their security staff since I was last there. The rep that helped me was somewhat patronizing which keeps me from giving the final star.< /Text></record>

< review>
Upon entry of Tiffany & Co, associates were unwelcoming and had poor attitudes. I felt as if we were immediately profiled as individuals who weren't worthy of being in their establishment. When asked for help, the associates were cold and short. I understand that Tiffany is a high end retailer but regardless of that fact, they should treat customers with respect regardless of how they may appear. If I was unkind, rude, or unfriendly, I would have understood such behavior.<//review>

I will say that this review is a bit overdue... I live in Sacramento and drive all the way out to Modesto specifically to get a fresh cut here. I’ve been going out that way for well over a year now, and it’s 100% worth it. I never leave the shop not feeling like a new man. Not only do they do an excellent job cutting hair, but there’s just a ton of life and personality in the shop which is always something I look forward to when I come visit.

Thanks for all you do guys!</Review>

<rate>5< /rate><Text>Best haircut and experience I've had at a barber shop.
Went here for the first time to get a haircut for my wedding. Yasmin cut my hair and beard and did a fantastic job! Not only that, she helped me choose what I wanted for my hair when I wasn't sure and was patient when I was indecisive about the beard style. The other barbers also seemed very professional and skilled.

Atmosphere is nice and simple, not too loud or annoying and they kept things tidy. Highly recommend.

Easily 5 stars.< /Text>< gmap_id>

This place is always awesome! I got my beard shaped by Morrio today and let's just say that I can add him to the select few that I can trust with my beard. This place remains busy at all times because they are all OG's when it comes to being barbers. I recommend this place to everyone that I talk to or anyone reading this place.<//review>

I will say that they do a great job on hair. They took their time and made sure it was done to my liking.  I liked the music they played and the atmosphere was cool as well. The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because we had to wait for about 4 hours before they got us in a chair. They were telling everyone about a hour for the wait. I will definitely go back, just make sure to go during a week day and make a appointment.</review>

I went to two other places prior to this one since I moved to Modesto, and this one for the price and quality is far and away the best I’ve experienced. For those of you complaining about the wait times, some of, if not all the barbers, have an app that one can access to schedule appointments. Personally, I’ve had Danielle for all three of my cuts and she’s been excellent!</review>< pictures>

<Text>Love this shop. The work they do is great.  Nice atmosphere and the friendly staff. Went in today with a picture and asked if they could give me that cut and Jess got it handled.  I love that it's a small local business.  I heard today that they are expanding, which should help cut down the wait times.  But I'll never go back to a chain haircut place again.  The hot shaves are excellent, so relaxing.<//Text>< Pics>

<Review>Glad I found this place. I liked the vibe, haircut and beard service. I had to wait a long bit because Saturday is first come first served.  Their play list is same as mine. Didn’t hear any Elvis P. like the other reviewer noted; I don’t mind Elvis, but he’s not on my play list. Ike had me.  I’ve been going to another place for a long while, but they cancelled my appointment and I had to scramble.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

Really Amazing atmosphere, Making your way in the world today takes everything you've got.
Taking a break from all your worries, sure would help a lot.
Wouldn't you like to get away?
Sometimes you want to go
Where everybody knows your name,
and they're always glad you came.
You wanna be where you can see,
our troubles are all the same
You wanna be where everybody knows
Your name.< /review>

<review>Referred here by a coworker. I was hesitant at first, as I am extremely picky about my barber. There are some great barbers in the area that put up a lot of competition, and I thought I had already found my end-all shop until I gave this place a try. The service is simply superb. These guys are friendly and conversational without being too chatty. They also lack that air of pretentiousness that seems to stuff up the shops of other barbers who are keen on their craft. The esthetics of the venue are second to none in Modesto. The joint is roomy, comfortable, away from the hustle and bustle of busy streets. They always have excellent music playing. Shoot, they even offer coffee, which comes off as complimentary rather than gimmicky. Most importantly, they work a mean cut. These guys know and love what they do. Whether you are set in your ways about where you go or are looking for some new stomping grounds, you owe it to yourself to give this crew a shot. Set an appointment for Monday thru Thursday or walk in Friday or Saturday. Get ur done. Good on ya.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None< /response><GmapID>0x809054391dbcb973:0x1e8f936e38090835</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

In addition to that everything that i like on Old Navy website is not available in this store. I am really sorry that this store is the closest one me.< /Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNIf-V52BOB04ufX7EFso-zcn4Quwb29XjxaBal=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPWlJE0a1dR4M-euEkqsQKlZ8OPzbU1aP0WY2Xv=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMmwgmNw6q-s2b_VwTangto5Kh8l20hVD-Ry9v3=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures>< response>

This location previously had a nice selection of affordable plus size women's clothing. I went in and found that the plus size section had been greatly reduced. Was very disappointed.< /Text>

Great affordable selection. To improve, a suggestion would be... Increase inventory in common sizes and increase cashiers
If there were better support, I'd visit Old Navy more often!<//Text>

<Text>SLOW SLOW SLOW. Waited for 5 minutes, 4th in line. Not moving. 5 more people behind me, not moving I left.  I went back later explained and asked them to match their own online prices and they couldn't. I left again and bought online shipped for $15 less free shipping!!<//Text><Time>1567302355569< /Time>< userid>

Good store. Staff kinda ignores you. My main complaint is the have stuff priced at one price then you ring it up and they say that's not the price. Definitely makes me not want to waste my time shopping here.<//review>

Sales person  Michelle (lead) and Mercedes (leader) at the counter were very helpful. Helped me with ordering items that were not in the store and they get shipped for free to my house. They were very patient with me changing sizes and picking patterns. Love this staff and store</Text>

I love old navy but I went in to return a dress that I had paid about $30 dollars for and I had my receipt with me and the "manager" tried giving me $10 cash back and I told her no that it wasn't right because I paid $30 . Why would I be getting $10 back ? & she said that the numbers on the tag or on the receipt I guess didn't match with the ones in the computer , which really isn't my fault if they did or didn't but that was my original receipt and she tried telling me other . She ended up giving me store credit which I didn't want but had to take it because I had no option because she said she couldn't give me it in cash not unless it was just $10. I thought customers were always right, which I really was . WORST EXPERIENCE ever because I've never had that problem.< /text>

This is the only only navy near me I like to go there to shop for sales , well I recently went and was being harrased by some guy who I guess works for customer service  he thought he was intimidating someone with his fat as arms this man was following me throughout the whole store while I carried my daughter  ,he approached me very aggresivley and asked Me if I needed help many time I ask to speak to the manager and he just look plain stupid he didnt even acknowledge what his employee was doing was wrong . just because you walk into an old navy doesn't mean u have to walk with an item out . I felt so uncomfortable and this needs to be adress cause the way that man approached me was very wrong to the point where I walked out the store.<//Text>

<text>Wonderful, dimly lit (how I like it) bar. Very friendly & affordable. Pool table & juke box, always comfortable. A good place to while away a few hours. Good mix of friendly regulars & random people off the street. Very personable staff. Honestly my favorite bar in the Mission. On a shoestring? Enjoy $2.50 Hamm's all night.<//text>< Pics>

The worn in couches and booths are comfortable places drunkenly discuss philosophy. The bartenders are well read, nimble, and charmingly snarky. Thursdays, around midnight the place is overrun with poets and romantics. A real piece of San Francisco.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

I'm pretty sure it's cash only. If you want to get away from all the hustle and bustle of Valencia st, head on over here for a smaller crowd.< /text>< Rate>

Stumbled upon this restaurant with a friend as we were craving some Korean food! Ordered through a touch screen computer and waited outside until food was ready. Very quick and easy! We ordered tteokbokki! It was very good, perfect amount of sweet and spicy. Prices are fairly cheap with good proportions!<//review>

The thukbokki (spicy rice cakes ) is also full of flavor - sweet and spicy (spicier than the fried rice) but so good! My favorite was the fried seaweed rolls and dumplings (I dipped them in the thukbokki sauce and it was a perfect combination). Totally would eat here again when I'm in the area. Friendly service too!<//Text>

No-Frills Eatery, order at the counter. Very reasonable student prices, two can have a good dinner for $30. Good meat for the barbecue and very tasty. Not so loud that you can't have a good conversation there. Lively neighborhood which is fun to walk around. Kimchi Garden is tucked away and upstairs but worth finding, the nappa Kimchi is fresh and delicious.< /text>

it was recommended by the cab driver . the service was good ,the restaurant was empty. half way through the meal another customer came in and they were alone so invited them to join us and that seemed to put everyone at ease staff including. it was around midnight left with some soup  and found some of the best  doughnuts known . its close bye like 2 min walk i believe . find that you wont regret it< /review>

<user>114708326181144572323</user><review>Went for lunch with my Bf.  He ordered a Beef rib rice plate ($16) which was delicious but PRICY.
I ordered the Dolsat Bibimbap ($10 or $11 i believe) with beef. I was really disappointed as they gave me 4 VERY SMALL pieces of beef which was about 2 small bites. Also, the self serce miso soup didn't taste right.
Good customer service.
If I return I will NOT order the dolsat bibimbap again.< /review><rating>3<//rating>< Name>

The only criticism I have is that their tables are oddly small, so it feels a little crammed when you have 4 people to a table that is better suited to two or three people.< /Text></record>

<Review>Loved going to this place when I was at college. It had free WiFi, electric outlets, free tea, and good food. Obviously the kimchi  dishes are good but I always enjoyed the Kim bap for something that was lighter</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

Their beef bulgogi was dry, Theo selection of drinks could be updated, small cans. Pretty expensive for the quality of food</Text>

Waiting a simple udon noodle in a not-crowded and smelly restaurant for 25 minutes! I could eat in somewhere else. Actually I should, because the noodle came so small, but no indication about that on menu. Just waiting my time and life.<//text>

(Translated by Google) Kimchi Garden is my favorite Korean restaurant in Berkeley! It is very close to the university and very convenient. My friends and I go to this restaurant when we want good Korean food. They have delicious rice with vegetables, noodles, and of course kimchi. If you like inexpensive Korean food, I recommend Kinchi Garden! You need to try!

Кимчи Сад мой любимый корейский ресторан в Беркли! Он находится совсем недалеко от университета, и очень удобный. Мы с друзьями ходим в этот ресторан когда мы хотим хорошую корейскую еду. У их есть очень вкусный рис с овощами, лапша, и, конечно, кимчи. Если вам нравится недорогая корейская еда, я рекомендую Кинчи Сад! Вам нужно попробовать!< /text>

<review>(Translated by Google) It's a bit of American sweetness to Korean flavors.
It's not bad.

한국적인 맛에 약간 미국적인 단맛을 추가한 느낌.

(Translated by Google) It's at University of Berkeley, and it's a good homestay! The atmosphere in the restaurant is also active and I remember it was good.

(Translated by Google) A Korean restaurant that fits most Korean tastes around Berkeley. Just a restaurant! Very friendly to run by the host family.

When I received my buffet the cabinet door didn't close properly and the delivery guy assured me he opened a case and a technician would call me promptly to schedule a time to repair it. This never happened. I called the Ashley Customer service number and after sending photos of the necessary repair she asked me for the serial number on the piece. Couldn't find it anywhere so when I said it must be on the back and I couldn't move the piece to find it, she was annoyed and said so , I will need to send a tech JUST to get the serial number to order the part and then to return to fix it. I'm thinking to myself, this is crazy. I paid 1200 for a piece of furniture and they're annoyed at me. And the tech won't be here for 3 weeks.
So, their delivery guy lied, the customer service group is not really great at customer service, I'm kind of scared to see if the tech guy is really able to fix the little magnet attachment on the door. We'll see how this ends up. Not looking good so far. Next time I'm buying from RC Willy.<//Review>< Resp>

<text>Got a call that the table and center console delivery for the ordered set is outside our home, cancelled the delivery cause we’re not at home, and called the store, informed us that they will delivery the set at the same time, scheduled the delivery and been waiting, until we finally called the customer service cause we didn’t get a call from the delivery guy, and says that it cant be delivered that day. A 9 piece living room set ordered, arrived with only 6 piece set, called the store, they said only the 6 piece was in the statement. Not as promise by sales rep inside the store... BEWARE!!!</text>< rate>

<review>Absolutely horrible experience!  We bought a huge amount of furniture over 3 months ago and have got nothing but the runaround.  They lie and ignore your messages.  They will never call you back or follow through.  They just keep saying some items are on back order.  They won't deliver what is in stock because they don't want to make two trips.  The manager is never to be found and never returns a message.  Take your business elsewhere!< /review>< pictures>

Terrible customer service, damaged goods, managers won’t return calls and delivery stole sentimental item in the home. I wish I would have read the reviews prior to my purchase. Customer service is terrible and managers do not take calls or call customers back. Purchased a bed frame, delivery was scheduled pretty quickly. Item arrived broken and the delivery guys tried to tape the broken boards but ultimately couldn’t put the bed together due to other pieces being the wrong size. During the assembly they decided to use some tools my husband left on our dresser and somehow 1 of the tools in the set went missing. I’ve been trying to get in touch with the distribution center to get the tool back, since it has sentimental value - it was a gift from my husbands father. No one will return my call, the driver won’t admit he “mistakenly” took our tool and somehow, 3 days later the bed frame still hasn’t made its way back to the distribution hub so we can get a redelivery date. This has been a nightmare and it’s clear that Ashley doesn’t care about anything but collecting your money. They need to take a good hard look at there company values, ethics & staff. Allowing delivery staff to go to customers homes, only to take what’s not there’s, is bad business. Do better and hold your staff and managers accountable for behavior.<//review>

First time we have ever been to this store,  we were introduced to Aman. He was a really knowledgeable about the things we were in need of. We really felt comfortable with him, he is very kind and just a likable person. We bought what we came to get, and received a great discount and were treated great by all.</text>

<Rate>1</Rate><text>Worst customer service I’ve experienced in ANY industry. Purchased our sectional in October and we still don’t have it. It’s COVID times and we understand there are delays, BUT lying to your customers because your computer system and warehouse don’t sync up is completely unacceptable! Alex is the most unprofessional Store Manager and has trained his customer service reps to respond to customers via email saying “I cannot force my boss to call you” (Thanks, Sherry!). We still don’t have a delivery date and all they have offered to make any of this right is a $200 store credit that I have to go to the actual store to pick up. Still waiting on a call back from a manager (it’s been since Dec 26th that Sherry relayed our message to her boss) and corporate escalations hasn’t responded either (also since end of December). Never buying anything again from a company that doesn’t care about their customers.<//text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

<Text>Just sayin like it is...
May you rest well at night knowing what you have said and done. Hopefully hellions will come beckon in your dreams night after night. For we have done nothing of any sorts for you to treat us like so. We do not accept your racial profiling nor do we accept you ..who had given us false information. The days turn into a month, waiting patiently. We wait for our purchase items. But your customer service/billing/shipping old hag looking like a busted can of biscuits with gray hair and creases Of lines on her face that shows Wear of how much misery that she has cause to other people..having said a lot of things that she can not take back nor will she will want to be held accountable. May all you have said not become undone as you will live the remaining moments living with them and remembering them until you have become dust once more.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

I wish i could give 0 stars. This store is a joke. No one ever answers the phone or calls back. Still waiting on items ordered in May. Multiple items have come broke. No call when items do not show up on time. Rude and absolutely horrible customer service. Honestly, I have no idea how they are still in business<//text>

<Review>I guess I should have read the reviews prior to our purchase as well. We made a $2800 purchase (SO-776560) and found the corner wedge to be damaged after the delivery drivers put it in our living room and tried to position it so we wouldn't see the damage. I caught it and called customer service 2 hours after delivery to explain what happened and they said they would send a tech out to view the damage. That was on Dec 24,2020.... 2 weeks later a tech came out and said yes this damage looks like they dropped the couch and it needs to be replaced. It is now going on a month since delivery and silence on their end so I called and left a voice mail because ofcourse their "experiencing high call volume" and they said they will respond back within 48 hours and that came and went so I decided to chat online and now they stated that I'm not approved for an exchange but they will come to my house and fix it. What? That doesn't even sound right. There's a deadly virus called Covid-19 and I don't want 2-3 workers in my house if I don't need to. This is ridiculous and my advice to everyone is STAY AWAY FROM ASHLEY FURNITURE. THIS IS A HORRIBLE COMPANY THAT DOESNT STAND BEHIND THEIR PRODUCTS AND IS NOWHERE TO FIND ONCE THE PRODUCT IS IN YOUR POSSESSION!</Review>< pictures>

Buyer beware. Matt McCoy at the folsom store will be great at first. You’ll order your stuff and be told it’s available only to learn it’s not. Then when you go to the store he hides and won’t help you. This has been the worst experience. Do not purchase from Ashley Furniture. Go to a more reputable company.<//Text>

I bought over 13k in furniture in July and am still waiting for the rest of my order. The manager Alex is a lier, he says that he will call you, but never does. I never got an email or phone stating that my order is delayed. The salesperson was great, but my  experience with them has been an nightmare if I can give zero stars I would.<//Text>

<text>Paul was exceptional and Mitchell! Great Customer Service. We were greeted upon entering by Store Manager, Alex. I appreciated the help and discounts provided. I purchased two living room sets one for my mother and one for ourselves! I have had other purchases for Ashley’s in the past and purchased my Tempur-pedic and a bedroom set for my son. Lots of eye candy and wiggle room for some good deals!<//text><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

Horrible experience  -- 3 months delay to deliver a bed!

Would give 0 stars if possible

I ordered a bed frame in Dec 2019. The salesman in the store paired the wrong bed frame and headboard in the order, so when the bed arrived it couldn't be assembled. A technician who came to fix it thought the wrong screws had been delivered, so ordered them -- from the factory in Wisconsin.. 10 days to arrive, and when they did, of course did not solve the problem. When I complained a different tech ordered a new set of legs, --another 10 days to arrive, and again did not solve the problem.
At each visit to the store I was asked to wait at the customer service while a ticket was opened. Talked to the manager in person, and he couldn't help. The staff in the store seemed confused and kept passing the buck around about whose fault it was -- the factory in Wisconsin, the store etc.
After 2 months, the root cause was finally identified when they reviewed the original order. Then a new headboard was ordered --again 10 days to deliver. Finally got the bed set up in March 2020 --  3 months after the delivery!. No apology from the manager.

I observed the way the staff behaved during the whole episode -- the ladies at the front desk genuinely tried to help, but were hamstrung by their order process. The manager and other staff  could not identify the problem for a long time, and their discussions indicated they were just trying to point fingers.

Will never visit this location again.<//text>

Although our sales person was very helpful and professional, we couldn’t help but notice that many of the gas and quite a few of the employees were not wearing masks. We pointed this out and of course nothing was done. We purchased our furniture on a visa card that we had not used in months. Within hours of making our purchase our information has been stolen and somebody was on a spending spree at the Apple store in our town. Either Ashley furniture is extremely careless with their customers information, or someone did not appreciate our comments about mask wearing and decided to have a little fun with our credit card. I notified the manager, Alex, the very next day and received absolutely no response whatsoever. We have yet to receive our furniture...so I can’t comment on quality, But I would be very reluctant to shop at Ashley furniture again given the experience<//text>

This store is great but the customer service on the corporate end completely ruined it for my household, two attempted delivery both times products came damaged or didnt come at all, no call back, no apology, absolutely the worst customer experience I've had with a big store like this one...</Review>

You can't reach anyone by phone ( local store or customer service) for an update.  It appears to be designed that way.  Manager was suppose to get back to me to provide an update as to the delay in delivery.  INever did.  Finally, we got a refund and went somewhere else<//text>

Thanks to Mr. Longtime Employee Michael who blew us off when i mentioned not wanting to max out my credit card and acted like we didn't have the cash(when we did) to make the purchase, we took our business elsewhere and got a much better deal, and worked with a much nicer person. Thank you Michael for inspiring us to leave.<//review>

Today was an emotional day taking my nephews to buy new furniture since they have moved in with my husband and I after their father passed from cancer last month. Danka was so compassionate and took it upon herself to get John the manager involved to help give us the best deal for this transition for the kids. My family is overwhelmed with the professionalism and compassion of Danka and John during one of the most difficult times for my nephews. They are so excited to have new bedroom furniture that they can’t wait for the delivery. Thank you again we are more than appreciative of the two of you.<//Text>

Made a purchase 5/7/20 for couch, and artwork at Ashley Furniture in Folsom.

Couch delivered 5/14/20, though the quality is lacking and the couch itself does not compare to what was shown on the showroom floor. Was told artwork would be delivered at a later date. Countless DAILY calls, voice-mails, & emails on my part have gone unaswered almost 90 days now. I was charged for a product I never received without any follow up or correspondence from customer service. This company does NOT answer calls, respond to emails or voicemails. Customer service is non existent. I am absolutely disappointed in the quality of my new couch and would NOT recommend Ashley Furniture to anyone, nor will I make any future purchases based on my experience.

Mark my words, this company will put out a fake 5 star review right after this post in order to maintain deceptive 4/5 star reviews. Shameful...< /Review>

Had an amazing experience!! Our Sales woman, Karly, was very knowledgeable and was very personal. I would 110% recommend seeing her!!
She made our experience that much better! I personally am not too big into shopping for furniture, but she made it very fun and memorable.
Thank You to all the Ashley HomeStore Associates that helped us along the way!< /Text>

I should have read all the bad reviews here before purchasing. Horrible customer service and almost impossible to discuss your order with someone after giving them your money. Called yesterday to confirm by delivery was scheduled for today. Now I call today and they say it isn't scheduled for 3 more months!< /text>

My experience at Ashley HomeStore was incredible! Everyone had such a positive attitude and really cared about the furniture I was purchasing. The customer service team was amazing as well. Crystal Torres, the customer service representative who helped me explained everything in a clear manner, made sure everything was set to go for my delivery and reassured I understood everything.

They delivered the wrong pillows with my order. I called and asked for the right pillows to be delivered. I was advised they could not be delivered and I would need to return to the store for replacement. I went back to the store and was informed they never carry pillows in the store and they would need to be delivered. It took a solid hour for them to sort it out. During my wait, another customer had a negative experience and was upset the store manager was repeatedly unavailable and would not return her calls.</Text>

<Text>I am extremely disappointed at how I was treated at this store.  Maybe my purchase wasn’t expensive enough for anyone to care.  I have called this store and customer service several times to resolve the error the store made.  They never followed through with anything they say.

I purchased a mattress for my son over a month ago.  I never received a tracking number and when I search online using my order #, nothing came up so I had to call the store.  When searching for the number, I noticed the store used my old address from off my ID and not the address I used on my application.  This is the first time anyone used my address off of my ID without verifying it.  Also, what if I was sending my order to a different person?  It is bad policy to just assume an address without checking with the customer.  I just recently moved and I said that several times.

The representative told me that my mattress was being delivered the day I called to check the status and she asked me if I could go and get it.  I don’t drive a truck to transport a mattress, I don’t know who lives at my old home, and I don’t know the gate code.

The representative told me that they would send me a new mattress to my correct address because of their error.  This is lie #1.  She also told me she would send me the tracking number to my email.  This is lie #2.

I worked from home so I didn’t miss the delivery.  After a week, I called again only to be told the mattress was never ordered.  The call center representative said she would call me back in the morning to let me know what was going on.  This is lie #3.  No one ever called.  I called later that day to cancel the order.  This store was too flaky for me to continue. They told me I had to go into the store to cancel the order and that she couldn’t do it over the phone.  This is lie #4.  I left work early to be done with this mess and she told me I didn’t have to go into the store to cancel.  She said I would no longer be charged for the mattress but I couldn’t get a refund on my down payment.  That’s was lie #5.  A few days later, a payment was taken from my account.  I called yet again.  I was told that I had to continue to pay until the canceled order was approved.  I asked her to send me an email verifying I will get my money back and she said she would.  No surprises here, she never emailed me.  I think that’s lie #6.

This store is absolutely horrible.  No one has ever reached out to me.  Not once.  No phone call, no email, nothing.  I’m tired of calling and waiting on hold for 45 minutes-1hour.  Let my experience be a cautionary tale.  No customer deserves such treatment.<//Text>< pics>

This was my first time purchasing furniture. I decided to come into this location today and Alex and Aman took care of I and my family. They were very patient and accommodating being that we were super indecisive. I really appreciate the service I received and I will be back next week to purchase more furniture. Thank you guys so much! Anyone in need of furniture please don’t HESITATE TO STOP BY this location and get your furniture! I can’t express enough great service.< /review>

CAN THERE BE A 10 STAR BUTTON. This location is absolutely stunning. Jaime helped me find the perfect mattress for me. And the manager, Aarti, made the whole process a breeze. I was never pressured to buy, only assisted in making the best decision for me. THANK YOU SO MUCH. BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER. 👏🏼 👏🏼 I will definitely be sending my family and friends to this location.<//text>

My wife and I got an incredible deal on our new dining room, bedroom, and living room set. Jamie was fantastic. We never felt pressured into buying anything - she just gave us information to help us make the best decisions for ourselves. For any future furniture needs, we will be shopping at Ashley Furniture for their great prices and customer service!<//text>

<review>Very happy with our trip to Ashley. The sales were incredible and we ended up finding everything we needed to furnish an entire apartment at an incredible price. Matt was the salesman that helped us and I can’t say enough good things about him. He was there to help us if we had questions, but gave us our space and time to look around. He was very patient with our indecisiveness and spent a lot of time answering all our questions and helping us get the best deal possible. Love the look and quality of their furniture and can’t wait to have it all delivered!<//review>< pics>

<review>Had an excellent experience here buying a bed and bedroom furniture. Very chill sales process, not pushy at all, just helpful info to get me what I wanted.

Mohammed was really great in answering my questions and showing me options and furnitures that were in my budget.

John (manager) helped out in a big way also. Super chill, worked with me on my budget. Got us over the finish line.

Great team here. Great selection.  Highly recommend. Will return.< /review>< UserId.>

<review>If I could give Ashley Furniture negative stars I would. We just had furniture delivered less then 10 minutes ago and had the absolute worst experience. There is no return policy on the receipt.  The delivery men came at the last possible
minute to be within the window to which we waited ALL day for on a Saturday for a 7 pm delivery. We told the men that the furniture was not set up right. And for help to rearrange it. They just pressured me to sign the delivery and ran out. Ashley furniture is now refusing to return part of the furniture because it is used. Rest assured after many purchases with Ashley I will NEVER be returning and I will also be telling my entire corporation to never purchase from Ashley either.

Update 9/22- after multiple calls to store Gada refused to transfer me to a store manager. She also promised she would call back and never has.<//review><Resp>None</Resp><pics>None< /pics>< rate>

<name>Cayla Merchant</name><rate>1</rate><Resp>None</Resp><Text>Is 1 Star the lowest score possible? Maybe the worst company I’ve ever had to deal with. First, they tell us we won’t have our couch for a month because I guess you only make one couch at a time? Then, they give me a window for delivery and I request time off from work for that time period just to have you move it up 4 hours earlier. Then, I try getting the hours changed back to what it originally was and I sit on hold for 45 MINUTES. Then, the wrong couch gets delivered. Then, we’re told we have to call the store we purchased the couch from to sort it out except that store doesn’t open until 10am. I call constantly starting at 10am and don’t actually get to talk to anyone until 2pm. Then the movers finally come and get the couch again at 4 pm. Then, a rep tells us you’re out of stock on that couch and won’t be able to get the full couch for another month. (Again, you make this couch one at a time.) So we’re told we can get a partial order delivered tomorrow. We’ve waited this long so we say sure. I get a call and text saying you’ll be there between 12:45-4:45 on Sunday and so I request time off for those hours JUST TO GET A TEXT TODAY SAYING OUR TIME HAS BEEN MOVED UP FROM 8-12. Now, I’m currently on the phone trying to see if I can get it changed back to the original time you told us and I’ve been on hold for 20 minutes now. I imagine the long wait times to talk to reps is because I’m not the only one having these issues. Hopefully tomorrow we can get half of the correct couch and in another month we’ll get the other correct half but I’m not holding my breath.<//Text></record>

Matt McCoy at Ashley Furniture was a very relaxed and friendly guy. He wasn’t riding us, but was close by for every question. We enjoyed our “let’s look” intention that turned into “Let’s buy!”  Thank you, Matt, for letting us try everything and answering every question!  Can’t wait for delivery!</review>

If you buy furniture from Ashley Furniture in Folsom, I suggest you look up Erin in the sales department. I recently purchased several items from the Folsom store and she treated me with a great deal of respect and  professionalism. She went out of her way to help me pick out certain items, and was very patient when I took extra time to decide. After the sales were complete and before the furniture was delivered, I needed to change my mattress selection from one model to another. She took care of that without a problem. Then prior to delivery, I wrestled with a decision of keeping my original bedroom set choice, or going with another. I must have changed my mind three times over the course of two weeks, but she was upbeat throughout and helped me make the final decision, and she never appeared frustrated at any point. Plus, she set up very favorable delivery dates. I am very impressed by her patience, professionalism and helpfulness. She was great.</text>

The store itself is nice and i love going but the staff who sits at the desk always takes an hour to ring me up. It wasn't the guys fault the system is rediculous and kept not letting him finish the transaction and then the lady who was suppost to help him decided to help 2 other ladies who were behind me instead... so it took way too long not ok.< /text>

<Text>Ordered six pieces of furniture online, every single one arrived damaged or missing parts.   The tv stand I purchased arrived missing the screws and pieces to assemble it, so I was told they would be sending me an entire new unit (which I didn't want, I just wanted the assembly pieces).  I then received an email saying the stand was out of stock so they couldn't even send me a new one.  So now I have this tv stand I can't assemble taking up space and I have to figure out how to dispose of it.  I wrote an unhappy response email and no one replied.  I also note they do not reply to negative comments, only positive ones, so it is clear this is not a customer pleasing company.   I do not recommend buying from this company at all.</Text>< Pics>

<Text>I have to tell you . . .

. . . we were told that we would have the new fabulous bed delivered today between 8 am and 12 noon.

I have been in marketing and customer service most of my career, so I am a stickler for excellent customer service.

The drivers called a bit before 8:00 to verify the address and that we were here. They arrived at 8:00 am. But wait, there is more!

They arrived in a very large truck as these two, Eric and Santos, had 14 deliveries today. As it happens, it is a challenge to get a pickup around the corner to our drive at times. Santos driving and Eric guiding, they squeezed that rig through the corner and down the drive.

They arrived with a smile and removed the old bed and set up the new system in no time flat. They removed all of the debris from the delivery and took it with them too!

There are no words to express how delighted we are that Ashley took charge and stepped up their game in their warehouse and delivery department. A+++++! Now, they are going to be known for great customer service, not just from Million Dollar Michael Macy, but from the delivery team too!

THANK YOU!</Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

As soon as we walked in we where greeted by Brandon. He was very friendly and personable. That day we ended up with a bed and an entertainment center. Brandon was very helpful. He helped us get exactly what we were looking for. Made the whole trip fun and smooth. We are definitely going back. Hopefully to find Brandon again.< /Review>

<review>This review refers only to Folsom Location.
I live in Folsom for six years now and I have never seen such a racist customer service as in this store and in general in this city. The crazy thing is that all employees are like that except one lady her name is Love. I cant say anything bad about that lovely and caring person. Unfortunately, when i was shopping that day Love was on vacation. I really wonder how come they are still in business. I would not recommend shopping from this store. They do not care about their reputation, never return calls back, and have this arrogant attitude in store. When they realize you want to really buy something then they start looking at your face..... after waiting for a few weeks for my delivery to arrive i had to cancel it due to their sloppy and careless customer service.
DO NO GO TO THAT LOCATION. THEY DO NOT DESERVE YOUR BUSINESS.</review><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None<//resp><gmap_id>0x809ae500b32e579d:0xc5a750eddb7eea1d</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

This was my first time shopping for furniture at Ashley Home Store and I am now a customer for life. I was welcomed and felt right at home the moment I stepped inside the store.

Aarti and Matt from Ashley Folsom were knowledgeable, patient and worked with me to stay within my budget. There was never any pressure, just genuine Customer Service

The delivery was confirmed a few times and everything arrived just when they said it would.

There is something for everyone, so many designs, colors, styles and more. So far everything I have received is of excellent quality.

I just moved into a new house and so I will be going back soon. I'll be asking for Aarti & Matt, because I have confidence they will help me furnish my new home room by room...</text>

I had a very positive experience while shopping for new living room furniture today at the Ashley Furniture Store in Folsom.  My Sales Associate, Tina Turner, was so pleasant to work with.  She  was very knowledgeable and answered all my questions and provided helpful suggestions.  The Store Manager, Valentine, also provided excellent customer service.  I am extremely pleased with the outcome of my purchases.   I want to express my appreciation to Tina and Valentine for making the process of shopping for furniture a pleasant one.<//Review>

Brandon was the perfect sales associate for our sofa purchase!  He was not overbearing or pushy but extremely patient and informative.  He showed us options that met our wants and needs and suggested a few other styles, as well.  He was extremely personable and made our shopping experience pleasant and enjoyable.  We wish all sales associates were as informative and accommodating as Brandon.  When we need to make a furniture purchase again, we will seek out Brandon again, for sure!< /text>

Alex and the rest of the crew made our shopping experience fantastic. Easy to get along with, more than thorough in their knowledge about all the mattress options to select from. They provided a very relaxed atmosphere from the moment we walked in.
Thanks does not come close to how we felt leaving the store with so many fabulous and generous selections.

Definitely met and exceeded our needs... we will be back.</Text>

<Text>The customer service is extremely poor. It takes over an hour for them to answer the phone, then they hang up on you, give you the run around, tell you to call someone else. I spent two hours on hold listening to music before talking to an actual person.
I was sold an adjustable base with motion sensor lights, which was part of the reason I bought from Ashley, and then the base without the motion sensor lights was delivered.
I was told to call the Ashley 800 number, then they referred me to another 800 number, each of which were over one hour on hold. It was very frustrating!
Finally, they told me that what was delivered was not what was sold to me, and that it would cost me more to get what the sales person originally told me I was getting.
I would not recommend doing business with Ashley. This felt to me like it was “Bait and Switch”.< /Text><pics>None<//pics><Response>None<//Response>< Gmap_id>

I have to say going into this furniture store was amazing. Very wide selection. When it comes to kids adults living room any kind of  furniture you basically would want is here.  Angela is very very good and takes the time to know what your needs or wants would be and to fulfill them. CouId have not ask for a more amazing knowledgeable person to help me in my decision.</Review>

My husband and I went to Ashley Furniture in Folsom, California. We went there to kill time while our tires were being replaced next door. Fell in love with our couch right away. As soon as we entered Ashley's Furniture, a salesman greeted us at the front door. His name was Dale Krebs. He continue to help us through our purchasing experience. We chose to finance, so that we can get the extra percent off on the couch. The process was very smooth, and rather quick! Which was great, as for we had a tight time frame. And the delivery schedule was very open. We're going to get our new couch in a week! Thank you Dale for all your help. We will be back!!</text>

<Rate>1< /Rate><text>Worst furniture store ever!! I sat in several chairs asking for the one with support for my back. Found one that helped me. When the new chair was delivered it had no back/neck support. I have to practically lay back while sitting in this chair. And you can forget about return policies. Once you sign for something that’s it...the deal is closed. I don’t know what I was thinking buying from here. Live and learn as they say.<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

Everyone was very kind and helpful and the store was very clean. The lady who helped me, I think get name was Samantha, was very knowledgeable. She gave me a sleep test and was able to explain the differences in all the mattresses. I would definitely recommend this store to anyone buying furniture.</Review>

We came into the Ashley store in Folsom, California . We were approached by a salesman named Dale. It was our best experience ever in making any purchase. Dale showed us what we were looking for in couches. He was very knowledgeable and at no time hurried us or pressured. Our delivery was weeks ahead of schedule as well. Delivery team also handled our couches with care. Set them up and had us look them over. Quick but efficient.
We were in a recent forest fire and lost our home and all the contents. We’ll definitely look at Ashley Furniture but want Dale to assist all along the way.

Poor customer at the store level, and a failed delivery

Purchased a bed frame a week ago.  We had a delivery set for today (2-21-19). I was contacted a couple days before several times, and the time frame changed a little, but no big deal.  Drivers showed up on time.  However, after about 10 minutes, they said, “we have a problem.”  They forgot the headboard.

I was really frustrated.  The driver was nice apologetic, but didn’t even know what to select on his phone (one option was partial delivery, and he was asking me if he should pick that).  How should I know?

It ended with him telling me they would leave the pieces here they did have, and come back tomorrow with the headboard.

I called the store shortly after, and requested to speak with the manager.  A lady took my message, and stated he would call me back.

After 4 hours, I decided to call back.  Another lady answered.  I stated I have waiting for a call back.  This lady stated he was in an interview, and that’s why he didn’t call back.  I question that.  An interview for 4 hours?  Is it more important to do an interview, or take care of an existing customer?  That seems like a clear to me.  The lady told me someone should be calling me to reschedule, but could not tell when they would call, and stated that the drivers should have not told me tomorrow, because it’s probably not going to happen.   I can almost guarantee I will have to call again (I hope I am wrong)

After I get this frame situation handled (who knows when that’s going to me), I will never want to shop at Ashley’s again.  I also wanted to try and give the store the benefit of the doubt given they do not load the trucks and do deliveries. That being said, it was clear from the first phone call today they have no interest in caring either.  No apologies, no I’ll have the manager call you back, no empathy at all.

Poorly run company on the retail and delivery side.</Text>

Visited the store and were met with a salesperson who didn’t seem to have any answers, and couldn’t find details in their system of a piece I found online. He got a mgr to assist and the mgr got it all worked out and came up with a price that was less than online so we bought the sofa bed for guests arriving for xmas. Salesperson said piece was available and setup delivery for Dec 12th. On that date I called to get delivery info since no one called me as I was told would happen, and I was told delivery is setup for Jan 15th. I disputed that and she said the piece is not available until Jan 10th and that it was never setup for Dec 12th. I complained and she said she would let the store  and their logistics group know of my dissatisfaction and have yet to hear back 2 days later. I’m guessing my complaint went into the complaint bin which sits on the ground next to the desk.</Text>

I had the best buying experience with Dale Krebs, who helped me most of the afternoon with ideas and feedback. He advised me to look around and was available for questions once I found what I was looking for. It was a 50% off sale day, and I was very happy with that! I highly recommend Ashley Furniture, ask for Dale!< /Text>

I would give this place 0 stars if I could. Don't come here for anything. They are very unprofessional. I bought a bed set from this location and when it was the day to deliver they came late and brought the wrong size bed frame. They left the night stand and dresser at my house and when I called they said they would deliver the right size bed the next day and call me back to confirm. They never called and I had to call them again the day I was supposed to receive the bed set for them to tell me it's coming the day after. And they kept playing this little game and pushing the date back.very unprofessional and they're just trying to make money. Save your time and go to any other furniture store, there's millions of other ones that have better quality and service then this trash. Calling yourself the best furniture store isn't gonna make you the best. Im in the process of returning my entire set and getting a refund since my bed frame still hasn't came in yet. Just don't waste your time. They also left numerous marks on my hardwood floor and freshly painted wall!  Never going to any Ashley's furniture store again!!!!!</review>

We had a fantastic experience. Our salesperson, Angie, was great, professional and knowledge. We found a smoking deal within 5 minutes of walking into the store - a six-piece livingroom set that was only $200 more than what we planned on spending for just a couch.

Update - 2yrs later.  The couch construction has not held up... the support for the cushions is too meager and does not provide enough support resulting in the cushions sagging a lot...</Review>

<text>I went into the Folsom store and picked out some artwork (3) pieces. James our salesman was very kind but couldn't get support from management staff. After spending 40 minutes we were asked to come back by Alex (sales manager) in 40 minutes and start all over. Apparently being a sales manager doesn't give the authority to do much.</text>< rating>

<Text>Vinny Ly helped us find the perfect bed today! Along with his supervisor Ricardo, they fashioned an attractive deal that fit our budget. Vinny was professional, answered all our questions, and provided a number of options for us to consider before we made our purchase.  We experienced NO high pressure tactics at all!!! Thanks Vinny and Ricardo for helping us find the right bed for us!

My husband and I had a great experience thanks to Allen, he did not hassle us around. We took our time & made sure we were making the right decision. We went to Ashley's for a new dining table the deals were so hot that we ended up buying a dresser & a night stand. The only thing that sucked was that our table was out of stock =( but besides the fact it was our pleasure doing business with Allen. We will definitely come back again!!!!< /Text>

When the remaining 2 chairs were delivered after 10 days, guess what, they had the same problem. I have to sent it back again. As of today, I have not yet received call from customer service as to when it will be re-delivered.

Customer service was horrible. Online price for a twin bunk bed was $299. In the store it was on memorial day sale for $649. When I told them,  they informed me I must be wrong. Then I showed him the online price and they tried to come up with an excuse. Finally they were going to price match their own price, but by this time I had enough. I ended up buying from 1stepbedrooms.com with free shipping. They beat Ashley's price by $75.<//Review>

<rate>1< /rate><review>Notified delivery time changed the day before it was originally scheduled. It had been scheduled for the afternoon and then was changed to the morning.  After almost three hours of waiting we called and were told that the furniture was never loaded onto the truck yet no one bothered to call and tell us what happened.  only remedy offered after 20 minutes on hold was to send an email to the store to ask for a refund of delivery charges. We had already removed our old furniture because they wouldn't take it. Now we have to wait until Saturday or take off another day of work for them to deliver it. Called store to complain and was on hold for a half hour andawas told I was being transferred to a supervisor then they came back on and said they couldn't reach his supervisor only wanted to send us to the delivery service to discuss remedy. Kept wanting to put the blame on delivery staff even though they're the ones that manages the delivery service.  once they discovered that the shipment wasn't on the truck they should have rescheduled the appointment for the afternoon instead of leaving us hanging, since the original scheduled time was for the afternoon. Really regret buying this furniture from Ashley furniture.

Update: went to store to complain to manager, discuss resolution and compensation.  New delivery date of 4 days later and refund of delivery fees and $200 refund.  Was supposed to receive all three pieces on Saturday.  Tracking showed all three on the truck.  Delivery truck showed up without 1 of the couches.  Delivery guy said store should have called.  The one couch that was delivered was damaged.  Had called customer service. Rep didn't like what I had to say and hung up on me twice, called back each time claiming she couldn't hear me.  This is a common practice in call centers where the intent is to disrupt the flow of the argument in an effort to get control of the conversation.  Was eventually connected with store, told manager was busy.  Went out to store for face-to-face resolution again. Receptionist went to office where manager was with 2 other people.  A few minutes later he walked out, looked at me then walkedwoff in opposite direction and around the wall.  My sister pretended to be a customer and approached him and got him to come to customer service desk.  Because the clerk didn't listen to me they were going to to send out another rocking recliner when it should be the couch in addition to the missing couch.  Then they told me the replacement couch was back ordered and couldn't give delivery date for couch that wasn't delivered.  Walked with no offer of additional compensation and a promise that he was "105% certain" he'd call tomorrow at 11am.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><date>1547955918612<//date>< resp>

I was visiting my family in Folsom and decided to go look for couches for my house. I went to the store in Folsom to see if they had different couches than the store at home. As soon as I walked in the door, Samantha was very friendly and personable. She asked what I was looking for and right away showed me several options. She is very knowledgeable and was willing to work with me on the pricing. She made this whole experience well worth coming to Ashley Furniture to buy a couch. Samantha along with several of her co workers were great, and I will be buying furniture at this location in the near future.</text>

<Pictures>None</Pictures><Rate>1</Rate><review>We were looking for a table. There was a black wood one we liked. We asked if they had it in white.. they did!! They shipped the chairs to us and we picked up the table from the warehouse 2 days later.

When I picked up the furniture i asked about the return policy and he said you have to talk to your salesperson. Anyway, I get home and its a cream white color! Does not match our white wood cabinets and trim. Oh well... at least I didn't put it together.. I'll take it back tomorrow.

I called our salesperson to arrange the return and she said "oh I'm sorry, once it's in your house you can't return it!" WHAT! We just paid $750 for a table that we don't want! We were told we were buying a white table!

Make sure you 100% want the piece of furniture before you buy it! (which is not always an easy task)<//review>< userid>

Kim and Hider could not have been more WONDERFUL to work with. They knew my situation and worked with me to make sure I got what I needed and made it the easiest furniture transaction I’ve ever made. I will absolutely go back there for every furniture need I have in the future. Amazing experience!!!</Review>

I really like their quality. I enjoy my couch and love seat and end tables. They have delivered four damaged living room tables to me in a row over the last three weeks. I will see if the next one is undamaged, and then, if not, I think I'll have them stop trying.<//text>

Frank was very helpful and informative when we needed him.  He provided suggestions but in no way made us feel pressured or was pushy for a sale.  He was interested in our needs and provided us with different options to fit what we were looking for.  He was very patient especially with having a little one being all over the place and touching all the items in the store. He was pleasant and did whatever he could to get us the best available deal.  When the time comes and I need to purchase more furniture, I will definitely be coming back to Ashley Furniture and asking for Frank!< /text>

<text>Samantha Little helped me out today as the President's Day Sale was going on. She was very helpful and professional on the phone and in store. She helped me patiently for about 2 hours and put up with my indecisiveness very well. I ended up spending $4,500 for over $10,000 worth of living room and bedroom furniture. What a great deal! Also, Samantha quickly felt like a friend, and not a salesperson. Thank you Sam and the rest of the staff. I am now my own adult with classy furniture.< /text><user_name>Holly Wafford</user_name><rate>5<//rate>< Date>

We bought a new sofa set at a great discounted price! We came back to buy a king bed and we were not disappointed! These guys give great customer service and Bob made sure he gave us the best price for the entire bed including matress and the box spring! Definitely going there next time for new dining table!</Review>

<Rating>2< /Rating><Review>The employees at Ashley furniture in Folsom are the best! They go out of their way to help, unfortunately they are only the sales team.

When it comes to getting what you've purchased the nightmare begins. They charged me for my living room and bedroom furniture, then started moving the delivery date back due to "back orders" or "not available in the warehouse." My living room was due to be delivered 5 days after purchase, 2 days prior to deliver they told me it would be 20 more days. 20 days with no living room furniture in my loft, no thank you.

The schedulers that call you will lie to you knowing you are not going to get your furniture when they promise it. I confirmed this with the folks in Folsom, I was made promises twice that were total BS. It's frustrating for the store employees too because it costs them sales.

It's a really crappy way to do business, but they already have your money so it's not a problem for them. Before setting up a delivery, confirm that you can pick up your purchases up in their warehouse the next day, if you can you will know they actually have it in stock and you can set up a delivery. I ended up making a deal where they sold me the floor samples off the floor and threw in an $800 love seat to make it right. Like I said, the folks in the store are awesome. As it is. my area rug that I paid for in July won't be available until September.</Review>< pictures>

We bought a bedroom set from Ashley's from Folsom, CA. Originally, they delivered a wrong bed along with rest of the bedroom set... king size instead of queen size. Once, it was returned, they did not make the delivery when it was scheduled. We cancelled the order and they were scheduled to pick up the bedroom set. Well, then we get a call that they were actually delivering the bed instead of picking up rest of the stuff. We made compromise and decided to have them delivered the bed again. Once again, they failed to deliver... We cancelled the order once for all and asked them pick up their rest of the stuff from our resident.

Once again, they called and made an appointment to pick up rest of their stuff. They called us, stating, we are 10 minutes away. We were so happy to hear that and we were thanking god for this nightmare to be finally over. These Idiots called us to confirm our address, which we have not used over a year. We explained to them, we have not lived on this address and the city over a year and that was not the location they originally delivered the furniture.

We have been calling them numerous times but with no luck.

They have not refund our money and seems like they are not smart enough to pick up their stuff where originally, they left at our resident.

Ashley's at Folsom, CA is totally unorganized, a bunch of idiots running the business, they are so stupid that they can't get their ducks in row.

DO NOT SHOP AT ASHLEY'S, THEY ARE BUNCH OF AMATURES TRYING TO RUN THIS BUSINESS WITH ZERO CUSTOMER SERVICE. IF YOU SHOP WITH ASHLEY'S, YOU ARE ASKING FOR INCONVENIENCE, AND REGRETS TO EVER SHOP THERE.

We are contacting Ashley's corporation and Better Business Bureau.  I suggest everyone to do the same.< /review>< pictures>

<Rate>1< /Rate><Text>Would give ZERO stars if able to. They delivered my mattress set and I told them that my mom won't understand what to sign, and they still said don't worry as long as its in good condition it would not matter. Well once they delivered my mattress and box spring, they left. My mom  told me that its very high, I told her it should be a low profile box spring, which it wasn't I called them back 5 min after they left to pick up the box spring and swap it out with the low profile because of a mistake. The driver said that they're on the other side of Sacramento and will have their manager send someone else out, which never happened. I also called the store about the mix up and they said they'll talk to their manager, which didn't happen until I called later in the day asking what did the manager say. Vinny said that he didn't talk to his manager yet, which was about 7 hours later. After he talked to his manager, his manager said he could only sell me another one at a discount of $79 plus delivery. I told him no it needs to be exchanged, I don't need another box spring. He refused to do anything, so I called customer service and they said they will contact the regional manger to have it exchanged. A week later I called costumer service again, because no one called, so they sent out another email and still no one reached out to me. It has been about two weeks since I got my delivery and cannot use it because they are still in its plastic wrap for exchange. No one wants to be accountable for this mistake that the sells person did and Ashley furniture doesn't ACCEPT RETURNS, SO DON'T BUY FROM THERE, IT'S JUST A BIG HEADACHE!!!!!!!!!!!!!<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None<//Response><gmapID>0x809ae500b32e579d:0xc5a750eddb7eea1d< /gmapID></record>

I had been shopping for a chest and dresser for over a year now and I was so happy to have walked in and to have found the perfect match for my current furniture. Aman was super patient with me and showed me everything I asked for. He even waited for my husband to drive up from Sacramento so that I could make my final decision. The sleeper that I first picked out ended up delaying the order since their manufacturing plant stopped making the sleeper. They promptly told me about the situation and helped me pick one that was close in style to the one I originally picked out. Then when their prices went down during cyber week, Alex was more than happy to make a price adjustment when I asked. They have truly earned a loyal customer and I'll definitely be going back for all my furniture needs.<//text><username>G M</username></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Shopping at Ashley Home Store was GREAT!  I hate shopping where you are followed by sales people and bothered.  I prefer looking and getting help when needed.  I always greeted by Dale, he gave info about where to look and then stayed nearby, but never hovering.  He was there for questions and info... then gave me a fantastic deal.   I'll never shop anywhere else.</Review>< Pics>

Wow! What a great experience at Ashley Furniture in Folsom. This is our second time purchasing furniture from them. They worked with us on pricing- matching an online price, and gave us a great financing deal. Danka, Alex and Griscard were pleasant to work with and not pushy. Thank you for the great Holiday shopping experience.</text>

If we could give six or seven stars we might have been able to rate Carlos properly for the way he handled our desires for new furniture for our family room. Carlos paid close attention to our desires and offered extra help in allowing us to purchase our new furniture and some special extras. He treated us with respect and gave us an exceptional price for the entire purchase. We are more than 5-star satisfied.</Text>

<text>Consistently friendly, courteous and very helpful customer service from Michael Macy keeps us coming back to Ashley! A recent visit allowed us to also work with Ricardo, who went out of his way to ensure that my mother-in-law received excellent service and had all of her needs met during her relocation to Folsom. What a fantastic team -- thank you Michael and Ricardo! You will see us again!< /text>< Pictures>

So far a great experience with Sam on our new couch and bedroom set. Hopefully the delivery and set up is just as smooth!

Above is what I initially thought when we ordered a few weeks ago and then delivery came along. Everything went great with our first delivery of the bedroom set and then I got the call to follow up on that delivery so while on the phone, I made sure to confirm our couch delivery for June 30th. I was told it was now set for July 4th and that was the soonest it could be. Keep in mind I told them I could not buy this couch unless it arrived by the 30th as we were moving into a new house, have small kids, and would be hosting something that night. They assured me that there would be NO issues and we were set. I even got a text later that night from Sam telling me everything was taken care of. I made the mistake of trusting them and swiping my credit card - quite the bait and switch. Here we are on July 2nd and after going through a few customer service people and my sales rep we were able to get delivery today. Unfortunately we have been without a couch for a few extra days and hosted people Sunday who got to sit around in camping chairs. I was told the manager would be reaching out a few days ago and crickets. So be careful about listening to their empty promises on delivery dates if you absolutely need something.< /Text>

< review>
3-4 Years after purchase not very happy with the product. We purchased a sectional with recliners in the ends. Over time the vinyl begins to peel off, the padding insulation doesn't hold up and do not waste money on Guardsman protection plan or what ever plan they sell. We were sold that it covers EVERYTHING, but it doesn't cover everything and you only have 5 days from incident to report. We almost purchased a furniture set for our 5 year old a year later, but the quality of the "particle paper wood" and price was ridiculous. We purchased brand new solid wood furniture from a local business for a much better price. I'll never step foot again into an Ashley HomeStore. The store manager did off $100 credit towards a new purchase (Cost of the Guardsman Plan). I thanked her, but refused since I'll never purchase from there again.< /review>

<Text>7/21/2017 While I did give a good review. I must now change my review to the worst shopping experience ever. Merchandise was delivered defective twice, refund took over 7 weeks of daily drama to get check cut. I was told refund was done 3 times and it wasn't. Over charged credit card 1k+ dollars, corrected a month later after daily/weekly calls and then charged $326 of charges that no one to this day will tell me what it is and will not remove after much drama and passing the buck. I spoke to regional manager and he told me to deal with store manager. In the middle of this store manager has moved on. When I called corporate office they told me to deal with the store. The right hand doesn't know what the left is doing and everyone passes the buck and rolls over on everyone else. Meanwhile I am stuck in the middle STILL MONTHS LATER dealing with daily drama and stress. Short of the story SAVE YOURSELF THE TROUBLE AND DON'T EVER SHOP ASHLEY FURNITURE!!!!! EVER!!!!!!!!! on a final note the above is only a fraction of what has happened since 5/21/2017  I will leave 5 star rating to make sure this is seen by many. BEING THEY ARE THE BEST AT BEING THE WORST EVER!!!!</Text>< Pics>

<Text>Beware of them selling you stuff on sale. In addition they sell you the warranty that they do not honor. Bought some furniture with 5 year warranty. Now after one year, a defective item is not accepted by their warranty. Their excuse is tgat i did not report the problem when i detected that.< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

First starting with delivery services and dates being pushed back numerous time. Now with our current piece the delivery team split the furniture with the box knife while unwrapping snapped a few pictures had me sign and left. We noticed the slit contacted immediate they sent a tech to patch which he was unable to do. Now they are stating that per policy they will send another tech with a part to try and fix it we are going on a month of trying to fix a brand new sofa. I will never purchase furniture again from this organization. What they say and they do does not align.<//text>< Pictures>

This was our second time purchasing a room of furniture and the experience was exceptional. Lori was nonintrusive while we shopped around and very helpful when we made our selection.   She worked with us and her manager with financing and I feel like we got another amazing room with no stress!  Looking forward to the delivery!!< /text>

I had the worst  experience ever with my latest furniture delivery.  I was supposed to receive a 17 piece order on Wednesday 7/10 but due to mistake at the store with them ordering the wrong size mattress they decided (on their own, without notifing me)  that they would not not deliver what was available and I only received 1 item out of my order. I was on the phone for a total of two hours trying to get my my order sent to me. Horrible costumer service and follow through.<//review>

Don’t shop here! The Ashley furniture store in Folsom,CA is willing to lie to get your business and, of course, will not do anything to rectify the situation. Went to buy a Tempur-pedic mattress in May 2019, and was told if I don’t like it I could return it as per the Tempur-pedic return policy by my sales rep named Sam. Called back after a month to return the mattress, as Sam told me I could, but found out that Ashley furniture does not have a return/exchange policy and also will not honor the Tempur-pedic exchange policy advertised on a big banner in the mattress section of their store. I am now stuck with a very expensive bed that I don’t like. I am a rational person and don’t usually complain, but I feel it is very important to share my experience with others so they can learn from my mistake of trusting the word of this store and it’s sales reps. Despite Ashley furniture knowing that I was lied to by my sales rep, they were unwilling to own their mistake and at least help me exchange to get store credit. This store has low business standards, and will say ANYTHING to get your money. They use the usual politics and big business scams to get away with it.</review>

<Rate>1</Rate><Text>Store was fine to deal with. Customer Service is a nightmare to deal with after the purchase. Their shipping department is a joke. At this point according to them I'll be lucky to get my couches a month after original purchase afyer being garuanteed buy the sales associate we would get our furniture in no less then 2 weeks.< /Text>< pics>

Great experience! We bought our living room set today but had everything picked out last week. Each time we visited the store the sales staff had been super friendly and personable. If you're looking to buy a whole room, Ashley's is the way to go because for about $200 more you can turn your couches (2 couches and pillows) into a 14 piece set which includes coffee table, 2 side tables, rug, 2 lamps, a throw, picture frames, and 3 more accessories.
When we went to pick out our set there was a sale and that sale had ended by the time we purchased, but the manager was extremely helpful to do what he could to keep us in a comfortable price range to where we only had to pay $100 more than expected.
Can't wait to get our new living room! And we will be back for our dinning room!</text>

My product was supposed to be delivered and after waiting 5 weeks for it to come in they magically lost the delivery paperwork and told me I would need to wait another 5 weeks. Terrible customer service at the Folsom, Ca location. Delta the customer service rep was very rude on the phone didnt take any responsibility or pride in her job and hung up on me.</text>

We can't say enough good things about Danka! She welcomed us at the door with a warm smile, and was incredibly helpful and patient in helping us put together our purchase. The best part was that she talked to her manager in giving us a substantial discount since we were shopping for our living room AND our bedroom. We went to Becks, RC Willey, American Furniture, and LazyBoy, and by FAR, we received the BEST customer service and experience at Ashley. We should've come here first! Thank you Danka for a truly unforgettable experience!<//text>

Gary is the guy! I got a custom living room set and found a great deal on a floor model dining set. I am very picky and made 3 visits to the store before finalizing my purchases. I didn't like that they follow you around the store while you shop. Customer service/ warranty service needs improvement.< /Review>

My fiance and I recently purchased a new house in Folsom and needed some new furniture as well as a mattress.  Michael Macy and Olivia were amazing!!!! Their attention to detail, friendliness, and overall knowledge is refreshing. They took care of us every setup of the way and we will certainly make our next purchases from them!</Text>

DO NOT GO HERE OR ANY ASHLEY FURNITURE. I have been trying to cancel a couch order I purchased. It's been 3 weeks now, multiple phone calls with a phone system that is horrible and you either can't reach someone or are on hold for 20+ minutes each time. I have had to follow-up with this cancellation 5+ times. I don't understand why it's so hard to cancel an order. I am disgusted by the customer service I have received and will never make a purchase here again, it has been that difficult and so frustrating. If I could give them 0 stars, I would. I think the biggest issue I have is that they show 0 empathy regarding the situation whether it be on the phone or in person. A simple “sorry” goes a long way.< /text>

< Review>
This place is absolute TRASH. DONT ever shop here. It’s terrible how they treat their customers. They harassed up and didn’t deliver the furniture yet they charged us and when we tried to contact them to cancel the order they claimed that it was delivered. We have yet to get our bed that we ordered. We decided to return it all because they would not send the furniture despite it being almost a month since they were supposed to deliver the item. THey will not pick up their items we want to return. They tried to blame us for their MANY mistakes and charge us again for shipping a bed that did not ever arrive. Do. Not. Shop. Here. To top it all off they discriminated against us because of our ethnicity. When we contacted them over the phone we were placed on hold for HOURS and when they finally answered they either hung up or told us they couldn’t do anything or that they would call us back. They did not call us back. Save your money and shop elsewhere or you’re in for a lawsuit and wasted time.<//Review>

Mike S was great, he assisted my fiancé and I with choosing the right dining furniture, sleeper sofa, and 14 piece bedroom set. I was hesitant at first simply because I wasn't sure what I wanted and how I wanted to go about it. Any questions we had he was knowledgable and informative. All in all it was a great experience and the furniture arrives within the next week. I would also advise purchasing the protection plan, it'll be well worth it if you have kids or pets or even if you spill from time to time!<//review>

I love the Furniture .   I was attempting to order off the website.  The website  would not work.  So I called in and talked with an associate.  She was the most bombastic, ill mannered woman.  Blamed my browser on my laptop for the problem.  Listen Ashley Furniture my lap top is 2 years old.  Up date your damn site but don't blame the customer.  I almost did not place the order but wanted the side tables to much.  However, I'm done decorating that room and will not be shopping with you all again.<//review>

Supposed to have gotten a delivery between 8 and noon. At 7:53am the online app showed we were delivery number one! Yay! then I looked a little deeper and it showed they were already on delivery 3. Strange but whatever, apps screw up. At 11:30, still no furniture, the app shows they were on delivery 8 and I still hadn't heard anything. I called. Turns out they never loaded our stuff on the truck to begin with and no one bothered to call. So now I have no furniture in my house, I'm out a day's pay from work, and they can't redeliver until Saturday because I'm not willing to miss another day's pay on the hope that they'll show up.
someone from the local store is supposed to be calling. but then again they were supposed to call me this morning and let me know the delivery wasn't going to happen. Maybe I'll update this review if things improve.
Update - Rescheduled delivery and they still screwed up. Only delivered part of it and STILL no phone call to let us know. They just showed up with part of the furniture.</review>

The Sales person was very nice. However, the manager and the people that set up your order in the system was very disrespectful, manager is rude. He did not do anything to make me happy. In the beginning they give you all this good prices, but when it is time to pay they add tax to the delivery and other taxes, then your bill is much higher then you were thinking you are going to pay.<//review>

I went to Ashleys Furniture in Folsom in need of a whole house hold due to my ex taking everything we bought together. I was stressed looking for it all plus being there with my 18 month old. I went several times but was unable to get anything done cause of my baby. Went back in again on Labor day. Met with Angie and several other service men plus two of the mangers of the store. They all could tell i was over whelmed and was only  wanting certain furniture, and having my hands full with the baby. They were very helpful and making sure they could get me what I want. After several hrs there and my son running the store like a maze I was able to purchase a beautiful entertainment center, as well as two rugs and also free shipping due to the time it took to get everything through. I would highly recommend them and cant wait to go back and purchase more!!!!!!</text>

<Text>Horrendous Customer Service!!!! The sales people were great, however, once they got my money, they could care less about me or my future business.  They made a mistake on my delivery date then tried to make it all my problem.  Wasn't going to get my furniture until almost 3 weeks after I bought it because of their error on the paperwork. None of the departments communicate with each other and  I couldn't find anyone (even the store manager) to care about my problem.  Ended up demanding a refund before the furniture was delivered because of the awful customer service.  Will never shop there again.</Text><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

I had the worse experience with this store in Folsom on Bidwell.  Don't go see Angela, she is only out to get a quick commission from you.  She doesnt follow up, she doesnt return phone calls, she puts the customer off and makes them do all the leg work when it comes to calling for delivery schedules.  The store is great, but this salesperson, not so great!</text>

<Rate>1< /Rate><text>Instore costumer service is amazing and I feel bad for canceling my order and him losing commission. But the warehouse and delivery system is so unorganized/chaotic. We specifically bought our 2nd choice couch because it was in stock and the delivery was before our Christmas party. The day before the delivery we went through a 20 minute over the phone confirmation process. The day of delivery we waited out our 4 hour window. I called to get an update and the warehouse was closed on that day to count inventory. And to make it worse, the recovery was terrible. The couch is no longer in stock and there's no estimated time on when our couch would arrive and if they set another delivery date window, they couldn't guarantee that they would meet our window. We have a Christmas party and no living room furniture. We donated our old couch and tables to prepare space. I was also on the phone for over 30 minutes before hanging up after being on hold for 20 of that 30. The sales team is great though and I'm hoping they get a job where they aren't losing commission that they earned due to their warehouse system. My dad is a salesman and he relies on commissions, but I needed to get my order refunded (which that process is not going well either).<//text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

We purchased an outdoor furniture set (glider, table, two chairs, rug, and throw pillows) that we saw in the Folsom store. The in-store guy we worked with was awesome. I told him originally we wanted to think it, and he gave us his cell. When I called him back on the last day of the sale, he was out, but he made sure we could still get the sale price, and we concluded the transaction on his return. When I forgot to call him on our arranged day, he reached out to us, which I appreciated.

That’s where the good part ends. When we got our delivery last Friday, the delivery team said our rug was on back order. This was news to us, and the delivery team was surprised we didn’t know this already. They had no estimate on when we'd get the rug. In addition, two of our cushions were missing, one of the throw pillows looked like it had some mud splattered on it, and one of our glider cushions looked like somebody with grease on their hands had handled every side. I don’t think it’s reasonable to expect that when you pay a lot for new stuff that the items should (1) arrive; and (2) be in new condition.

I called the delivery number at around 10 a.m. that Friday and explained my concerns, and the woman who I spoke with (while polite and empathetic) said she didn’t know how to handle my order. She asked if she could call me back. By 4:30 p.m. that day, I had heard nothing, so I called again. I was advised that when they got everything squared away, they would give me a call. It’s now 11 a.m. on Monday, and nobody has called. I have no idea what the status of my order is. But what I can say is that every time I've called, I was on hold for (no exaggeration) at least 20 minutes before I spoke to a human. In the aggregate, I have probably now spent 1.5 – 2.0 hours trying to remedy this issue. I am posting this YELP review in the hopes that someone with Ashley corporate will read it and resolve this issue without any communication except to email me when I am getting my stuff. I should not have to another second on it, in my opinion.<//text>

<review>I did extensive research for a lift table and finally found one at the Folsom location.  I called and got Ryan Mcelwain on the line and bombarded him with dimension questions, color of the wood, etc.  He not only text me photos and measured for me, he skipped his dinner break because I decided to run over to look immediately. Ended up with a great table and at the last minute added 2 end tables.  At warehouse pickup, the 2nd end table did not look right and instead of asking me to make the almost 1 hr. trip back to the warehouse, he shipped due to the inconvenience (I waited at pickup almost 2 hours).  Excellent customer service and communication.  Next time we have any needs this will be our stop.  Very impressed.< /review>< Resp>

<Text>Terrible Delivery Service - Won't Answer Phone!  They delivered my furniture 2 hours AFTER my 5 hour delivery window.  Essentially expecting me to sit around all day waiting for a couch!  No phone call to say they'd be late - so rude!

I have spent at least 45 minutes sitting on hold waiting for someone to answer the phone over the past week (called 4-5 times), and NOBODY ever answers the phone - just hold music indefinitely.  I have purchased from Ashley in other states, but I will NEVER buy from this company again - anywhere.  Especially, with an RC Willey in town.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures><rating>1<//rating><Date>1528996363616</Date><gmap_id>0x809ae500b32e579d:0xc5a750eddb7eea1d< /gmap_id>< name>

< review>
The furniture and sets in the store are high quality, the prices are a bit high, but the service was so bad that it prompted me to leave such a poor review.  I would give 0 stars if I could simply because what I paid for has yet to even been delivered to me as agreed.

I ordered a table from this location on October 6th.  The rep was kind enough and fairly straight forward, though very slow (it took 30 minutes for him to fill out my information on the computer).  He told me delivery for Monday, the 8th.  I paid the cost of the table and the delivery fee, and signed the receipt and agreement, happy with the delivery time frame.  But an error occurred (gonna guess this was the fault of the technologically challenged rep) and the order had to be placed again.

After a few more minutes, the order was placed again - however now the delivery, told to me by rep and manager, was set for Wednesday the 10th.  Fine, not too bad - I leave.  Fast forward to Wednesday - no call, no delivery, nothing.  I look up my order and turns out it was actually set for Friday the 12th.  I am irritated at this point.

Come Friday, I'm taking time off work for this delivery yet - no call, no delivery.  I call the delivery center - they say that the truck tried to call me but could not get an answer (I received no calls).  After some investigation with the delivery rep, I found out the original store rep placed the wrong phone number in the computer.  It was CORRECT on my agreement and receipt, but he entered it WRONG on the computer.

After some time on hold with the store manager, I was able to get a measly refunded delivery fee and following Tuesday delivery.  Ideally, this store should have discounted my purchase as well, as I could simply charge back my credit card for 'no goods received as agreed'.  Because this situation is just that: my agreed upon delivery that I signed and paid for was three times dishonored, and I have yet to see my order.  On top of all this, I lost time from work to wait for this.

Please do yourself a favor and look elsewhere for your furniture.</review>

<text>As soon as we walked in my girlfriend and I were greeted by Giscard in a very friendly matter. He was able to help us find what we were looking for and gave us some great suggestions. Throughout our visit he made sure we were finding everything we needed let us know of the deals they had going on. Defentily would recommend this store! They have great furniture and great prices! Thank you Giscard for all your help, really appreciate it!</text>< Rate>

Danka helped us pick out everything we needed and we also purchased two nightstands for our bedroom. Danka was also very patient with us as we were kind of all over the place on what we wanted. For what we bought I thought the price was fair and Danka was great to work with. We will come back to buy furniture for our son room next weekend.

Placed order for King size bed. Sales person didnt adjust or give any discount despite of the Thanksgiving sale. they are looking for a bigger order or else bad luck on the single item purchase. Anyway Placed order. Got text that the furniture would be delivered on a specific day (today). Waited for it at home. No one showed up. Called the Store, they kept transferring one dept to other. Finally someone said.. that the driver went back and asked for reschedule the delivery.. The dispatch team was rude to answer me and didnt provide any reason as to what happened. I told them to cancel the order. They asked me to contact the store.. Called The store.. without even asking of what happened, they asked for my details and canceled my order. This very ridiculous. I would NEVER ever ever shop at Ashley. Does't matter if they have good collection in their store. What good it is if they can't satisfy their customers. Very bad experience.</Text>

<text>Phoned in to get clarification on financing options in addition to pricing listed in mailer and web pricing. Olivia answered the phone and transferred the call to a sales person. Sherri picked up and was bothered by every questioned I asked as if that wasn't her job. The level of poor customer service due to being over the phone was degrading. Considering the dining room set and accessories I was interested in was well over 5k I will much rather take my business else where. When calling back to confirm sales reps first and last name Olivia who answered the phone again said she was unaware of Sherri's last name. How the heck are you the receptionist and don't know the last name to your sales rep? Shady business all around. Will be contacting corporate.< /text><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmap_id>

Bought our couch from here after shipping around at all the furniture places as far as Ranchi Cordova. Prices were cheaper than most and product is known to be good.  They offer an extended 5 year warranty you should not pass up, no hassel sale, friendly helpful staff doesn't hover as you shop. Delivery is extra.< /review>

My experience at Ashley Furniture was amazing ! Me and my finance ended up going here and we were helped by Angela Harris and she showed us around to what we were looking for a bed frame for our cal king . We ended up going to look at the mattresses because we knew we wanted to upgrade from our current and they had a deal going on with there Tempur-pedic clouds to were u get a gift card and with the gift card we ended up getting a ridiculously great deal there regional manger Ricardo Gonzalez. They were not pushy or being the “salesman style “ they made us feel at home and as if we had new them for a while . after stories ,some paperwork and great convos we walked away with a cal king tempur pedic and a stunning bed frame for a unbelievable deal .

<Review>PROCEED WITH CAUTION
1) We were told we were purchasing a bedroom set that included a bed frame, dresser, chest and two night stands. The bed frame, one night stand and a broken dresser arrived 9 weeks after purchase. We were told our order never included the chest, they accidently broke the dresser upon delivery and the other nightstand would arrive in a few more weeks.
2) We were originally told that our furniture would arrive in 4 weeks, then 8 weeks, then 9 weeks. Here we are on the 12th week and the remainder finally arrived.
3) We were told SEVERAL times we would get a call from the manger and the general manager. We never once got a call back... from anyone... EVER.
4) BOTH times that deliveries were made we were given the delivery time frame of 1-5. The first delivery showed up at 7PM and the second at 9PM!! 4 HOURS AFTER the window. Right before it arrived the driver called us to tell us he only had 1 of the 3 missing pieces.  So at this point we have taken two full days off work for nothing and have received 3 of 6 of the pieces . Not to mention we were NEVER given a curtsey call to simply let us know they were running late. Upon calling to get delivery status, nobody can tell you when your furniture will arrive . That's IF you can get someone to answer the phone.< /Review><Rate>1< /Rate>< resp>

< Review>
Once they got my $$ for my very large order no interest in helping me. went to the store to ask why such a long back order ..over a month wait on half my order.. no one could help me.. the customer service desk was not available..they were all having a customer service meeting..how ironic..at least leave one person on the desk to serve customersor teach staff to multitask when customer service is not at desk...will never buy from this store again.. I hope I get my order before 2017!!</Review>

BUYER BEWARE! I really wish I would have checked these reviews before spending 5K on furniture that I dont have yet! Like all the reviews have said the sales team at Ashley's are great. Expected since they want your business (commission), but we weren't hassled, or rushed in the store. Angelina who helped my wife and I was fantastic. We bought a bedroom set (dresser, chest, night stand, bed frame head and foot), dinning room table with 6 chairs, 3 piece sectional couch, 2 rugs, and 2 sets of dinner ware and place mats. When purchasing we were told that we would have two different deliveries which was fine with us. 1st delivery was on time and the delivery drivers were great. We were missing 6 chairs, 1 rug, night stand, and the chest. Which was expected minus the rug. We got the call from Ashley's warehouse to setup the second delivery. They confirmed all of our items was in the warehouse except our rug. We scheduled for the most recent delivery which was December 16th from 3pm to 7pm. I took off work early to be there for the delivery. 7pm comes around and no delivery and no call. Wife calls and was told that the delivery truck was in citrus heights on delivery #10 and we were delivery #12 (the last one). We said okay - 9:30pm comes around and I get a call from the delivery driver stating that he was not going to deliver my items because he only has 4 chairs (of the 6) and 1 night stand. I told him regardless of what you have in your truck I need my items delivered. He then goes on about how he has been out since 9am yada yada. I told him that's unfortunate but I am still going to need my items. He then gave me more excuses and I told him I am going to need his supervisor or managers number to complain. He told me she wouldn't answer and then bagain to YELL at me. I hung up the phone and waited. 15 minutes later I get a call from the warehouse stating that I had declined a partial delivery and to setup my next delivery. I told the warehouse that was not the case I did NOT decline the partial delivery. She called the driver while i was on hold for 20 mins and then stated that the driver felt "threatened" and my items were not going to be delivered. The next day I went into Ashely's furniture to speak with a manger - Mike Wirth. Mike promised me a delivery date by the 21st and he promised delivery charge or $199 be refunded along with $150. Today is 12/27 I am still with out my furniture (6 chairs, 1 rug, night stand and chest.)

I recommend anyone and everyone to not do any business with Ashley furniture. Unless you're retired and like to deal with the bull *ish then have fun!< /review>

worst customer service ever i talked to amanda she was the only reason i bought anything she was great but next day called back and got the run around no one would call back and no one seemed to know anything about what they had in stock. Called all three stores and got the same thing 3 stores 3 prices and everyone said something different from we have to we don't have it. Finally delt with warehouse and lets just say they know more about the store them the people at the store congrats on at least them. Will never go back again.</text>

<Text>Ordered a chair that took 3 weeks to be delivered.  When we finally got it, IT WAS THE WRONG CHAIR!!!  The STORE MANAGER ordered the wrong one.  Now they are telling us that we have to wait ANOTHER 27 days to get the right one delivered.
Talked to the manager and they just blew us off.

GO TO BECK'S FURNITURE.  THEY HAVE THEIR ITEMS IN STOCK AND FOR LESS!!!!

We will never do business here again.<//Text>< Rate>
