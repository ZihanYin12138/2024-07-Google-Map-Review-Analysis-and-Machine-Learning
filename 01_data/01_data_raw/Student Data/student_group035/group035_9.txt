I appreciate the staff members. They work as a team... Monitoring people, making sure pods go INSIDE the washer. ALWAYS busy sweeping, cleaning lint trays for the dryers.
👍👍 EXCELLENT</Review>

I use the wash and fold service. Always done on time or early. It’s folded nicely and under garments are bagged separately.< /Text>

<review>Customer service is the best here. They make sure to greet you as you walk in and to dry your clothes is free if you wash your clothes there.

Don't use the wash and fold service.

1.Sudden schedule change without notice
: I ordered pick up on Friday and delivery on Saturday but they suddenly changed the delivery date on Monday and told me this on Friday when the driver came home.

2. Late for delivery
: The delivery date was Monday between 1 pm to 3 pm but got delivery on Tuesday after 4 pm.

3.Missing laundry
: Driver came home 3 times to get missing laundry. Found 2 strange clothes inside my laundry. Eventually couldn't found some of my towels.

I just want to say thank you to Ashley because she is very helpful.
Yesterday my son misplaced the detergent and Ashley fixed the problem. Also Ashley helped me to know how many loads of clothes I can put in the washer machines, and when I came back to pick up my clothes from the dryer machine, Ashley told me that she added more time because some clothes were wet.
Thanks Ashley, you are the best.<//review>

We frequent this laundry spot. We were customers to the previous owners. It’s a great place except they advertise a children’s corner and the last 3 times we’ve been here it hasn’t been working or the staff said they didn’t want to turn it on. Children’s corner is helpful when trying to get laundry done with kids. Also the staff was rude to my child. Maybe if they had the activity corner working my kid would have something to do.</Review>

I have nothing but great things to say about the laundry spot. The art on the walls gives a cool vibe. It’s very clean and I love the charging station, very convenient if you are going to be there a while. Overall, my experience here has been fantastic. I strongly recommend My Laundry Place.<//text>

I am in love with this laundry place 🥰🥰🥰. Just love the staff and everything. Robert was cool 😎. The only thing I am concerned about is the restrooms are nice and clean and easily accessible to everyone which is kind of bothering for me because there are always bunch of transients hanging around. I would really suggest that it should have a code or a key and should be accessible only to its customers. Also, I just saw a lady bringing in her wet laundry for free drying. I think they should really not encourage that and should only provide the service to people who give them business. Overall, I wanna go back again!

Your concern was originally one of our main concerns as well.  Just so you know, the bathroom does have a key pad which the attendant has to come back and open.  There will be an attendant there at all times.  Keeping transients away from our location will always be a priority, and the bathroom that we completely remodeled will only be accessible to our customers because of the key code lock that keeps it locked at all times.  This is the way we will make sure it will always be clean.  As for our free dry, the system will be changed within a couple weeks to only allow for free dry with a purchase of a regular wash.  So that is already in motion as well.  Again, thank you so much.  We truly want feedback so that we can continue to make this location better for our customers.  Can't wait to see you in the laundromat soon!"}</Resp>< gmap_id>

The dryers run cool, thus requiring multiple cycles. The staff is actively rude and often ignorant regarding those with disabilities. Crowded, tight space that makes mobility an issue. Wouldn't recommend or use again.<//text>

This place is so vibrant! The owner has really changed it. New washers! New dryers ........everything spic and span the people are warm. I loved it ❤️❤️❤️If you wash here the dryers are absolutely free. Do 10 washes here and get 11th one for free. Apple Pay, visa,discover , MasterCard welcome .... Soooooooo cool !!! Just love it 🥰< /review>

(Translated by Google) The laundry is fine, the only bad thing is the staff that they have in the morning, a lady who pretends to be Manager is very rude, according to her, you can fix all the laundry issues. For my part, I will not recommend it again to any of my friends ...... 6830 Stockton Blvd. # 120

La lavandería está bien lo único malo es el personal que tienen en la mañana una señora que se hace pasar por Manager  es muy grosera según Con ella se puede arreglar todos los asuntos de la lavandería Por parte mía no lo vuelvo a recomendar a ninguno de mis amigos ......6830 Stockton Blvd. #120

<Text>I got a front bumper paint correction (repainted) for my Porsche Cayman. The work they did is just fantastic - perfect factory colour match, and my ten year old car now looks brand new. They also returned my car with free paint correction on small areas, and polish all around the car. This is the best customer experience I've ever had with any service or product ever! Even if you think the quote may be slightly above the rest, just go for it! Highly recommended.<//Text>< gmap_id>

<review>I know nothing about car. So I am afraid to go to auto shop. But James & his team, super professional. He checks the car carefully, explain to u what need to be fixed, print out the quote. His front end staff deals with my insurance, book the rental car for me. It was excellent.< /review>< pictures>

<rating>5<//rating><Text>Talk about streamline service! Both Charles and Alicia made what was supposed to be a disaster and inconvenience into a pleasant and stress free situation. Charles is very thorough and responsive in quoting my vehicle and describing damages and Alicia was just as great in dealing with the logistics. Communication was key, service was A1 and the detail in work is outstanding. Hands down a great auto body shop and an even greater experience.< /Text><UserId.>107606250077345268667< /UserId.>< Gmap_id>

This is by far the best body shop I have worked with. Customer service and mechanics know exactly what they are doing to give you the best products and price. They didn’t offer any extraneous repairs for the car yet the final job looked excellent. See pictures of the front bumper, fender, and headlights before and after the repairs. They also installed new projector beam headlights and LED bulbs at my request. The lights make the car look even better than before the accident. Hoa and Charles, you are great at what you do. Keep up the superb work. I highly recommend this auto body shop.< /text>

The single best body shop I've had the pleasure of working with. They bend over backwards to accommodate you, keep you well posted on progress and any issues that pop up, and do an amazing job of sticking up for you to the insurance companies, I cannot recommend them enough. Even sent me the garage openers I left in the rental by mistake, you should absolutely bring your car here if you need to, they'll treat you right and guide you through every step of your claim< /text>

<Text>I can't recommend them.
There was a small dent in my car and they fixed it. No complaints here.
But when I got my car, I noticed that they did not install the molding and that the car was covered with a spray of clear coating - "overspayed".
They "tried" to fix it and removed about 20% of overspray. Only in those places where it was visible, of course. I don't want to deal with them anymore.
I spent hours and hours trying to remove their overspray but couldn't completely clean it.</Text>< Pics>

I have done 2 repairs with this company already on my BMW X5.  Charles and James are both amazing and honest.  The shop did an amazing repair and the customer service was spot on thru the whole process.  They even cleaned my car when I picked it up.  The shop is super clean and they have great snacks to top it off.  I will never go to another body shop in the south bay area.  If you want more references on this company, check out their reviews on Yelp!  Thanks again KAB.<//text>

Been there in Dec 2017. They've replaced the bumper on BMW 328i just fine and in a reasonable price (didn't compare with other places but seems ok). They ordered the part and installed it in about 2 days. Good job overall - bumper fits perfectly, color is original. Would recommend this place</Text>

I have to say I'm impressed. It's not fun having to get work done on your car, but James and the crew definitely made it a pleasant experience. The main body work looks great, but what I'm more impressed by is that they went above and beyond and took care of other things like a couple minor unrelated scratches, as well as detailing my car inside and out. This all happened in a good time frame at a reasonable price. Thanks!< /review>

This review is coming in a little late as life got in the way. However, what I can say is I've been driving in my car that I Kim's Auto Body repaired and I've had no issues after 1.5 months.

My Mazda 6 was involved in an accident where my front bumper was crushed in towards the engine, the radiator supports were bent, the sensors behind the bumper were affected amongst other things. Initially, my insurance strongly advised me to work with their recommended body shops. I did my research and chose Kim's Auto Body. I don't know much about cars and I found James to be honest, thorough in his explanation and patient. He walked me through the whole process, explained what parts would be best to go with, whether to take the insurance downgrades, etc.

In the end, I received my car with it looking and driving like it was never involved in an accident. I even got to test the front safety sensors when a car in front of me stopped short and I had to brake suddenly. I'm grateful all the safety features work as expected.

I would absolutely recommend Kim's Auto Body for their professional service and quality of work.< /review>

They did an excellent job on my Hyundai Genesis, which was near-totaled. It looks and performs like a brand new car. Their service was also unequaled, from getting a rental car to dealing with the insurance company. It was a true one-stop shopping experience with full service and attention to details a body shop can provide. I originally went to another highly rated shop in South Bay that I used in the past with a great satisfaction, but they told me to come back in 3 weeks because their shop was too full. Kim's took the car in right away and finished the car in about the same time that I can get the repair started with the other shop. This is a great shop. Ask for Charles.< /Text>

<Review>I don't leave reviews for anyone or anywhere, but this place is exceptional. The front desk was inviting and warm and when I met James I knew that I was working with a professional.

The front driver side fender was dented significantly a few days ago. My car was parked on the street and I woke up the next morning to a lovely dent. I took it in for a quote today and not only did I get seen on time, they went through the trouble of actually getting a good portion of the dent out in a matter of MINUTES. When you expect somewhere to be good due to reviews and then you go and they completely exceed your expectations -- that is service.

I wish more businesses operated in this way. Well done, i'll be taking my cars in here from now on.

Cheers,

<Review>I was T-boned in my minivan. I was found at fault and needed to get my car fixed on my own dime.  I had my passenger rear door and driver's side door replaced, frame work, and paint blending done. The work was top notch, done quickly for what needed to be done, and over a year later, has held up beautifully.  My rear automatic door mechanism was malfunctioning,  and Kim's worked out what the problem was and didn't charge me extra. The dealership recommended replacing the entire mechanism,  but Kim's saved me thousands of dollars by problem solving it. I cannot recommend them enough.  Hopefully I'll never be in an accident again, but if I am, I know where to go. Thank you Kim's!< /Review></record>

Amazing experience with Kim's Auto Body. My fiance and I have never been involved in a car accident until she was rear-ended. Charles helped us from the beginning all the way until the end of a not so pleasant experience and making the experience smooth. Charles educated us through the whole process and we were able to get everything squared away with the repair and claim!<//text>

They do a good job of setting expectations so there are as few surprises at the end of the job as possible.

This place is not trustable at all. I came here because I saw the good review on yelp. I am 100% regret to come here and will never ever recommend this place to anybody. The office looks fancy and the attitude is great at the beginning. When I picked the car, the Mileage increased by 200 miles. I do not understand why in 10 days the car has 200 more miles in the auto shop. The car accessory (the case cover) inside the car was missing. There are messy stuff on the leather of the seats, on the window here and there. When I pointed out the glue was on the seat and glass, they cleaned it immediately. What was worse, I found three new scratches one on the side of the passenger side door and another two on the front bumper. They did not admit it is their fault and refused to  take care of it. I am 100% disappointed about their ajtttude and how careless they took care of my care. Definitely do not trust them. They appear to be friendly but indeed they do not care about your car seriously. The car accessory was missing, there are messy dirty glues and dusts inside on the seat and on the leather. I brought in a new car where nobody has ever sit in the back seats ever. The back seats were 100% new when I dropped and were dirty and messy when i picked it up.<//review>

Got hit by a guy on a bicycle. Used Kim's for a 3rd time. Charles is great. I had them do a bunch of extra work just to keep my car looking good. I can't recommend them enough.< /review>

They did some body work on one of my cars and did a good job, the only thing is is that it was kind of expensive. The staff was semi friendly but a bit vague on how much it would cost, and gave me a price range. That is their only downside.<//Review>

Dr Suda has been our vet for about 20 years and I had the hardest day of my life deciding to put my Huggy Bear to sleep he was in a great deal of pain but his mind was as sharp as ever and I am very great full to the staff for understanding how hard this decision was and being so kind I am glad to have such good vet and staff<//text>

Awesome veterinary practice.  Dr. Suda is committed to giving his clients and patients the best service possible and is very reasonably priced.  He does not recommend or push unnecessary tests or procedures.  I am glad I was accepted into his practice before he stopped taking new patients.<//Review>

<Text>My family has been taking our pets here since 2001, this is by far the best vet in town and I hear this from many family friends and acquaintances from over the years as well. And also, they don’t charge an arm and a leg to tend to your pets, most vets and pet hospitals take advantage of you being desperate when your pet is injured or sick, but the olive veterinary Hospital has a heart and cares.</Text><Resp>None</Resp>< name>

Ive been taking my dogs & cats to This pet hospital for over 40 years. I can solidly say that Dr. Suda is an very experienced and friendly veterinarian, great sense of humor. The staff is beyond competent. Prices are very reasonable. Olive Veterinary Hospital will go the extra mile for you and your pets. I strongly recommend this group!<//Text>

The  Dr. Suda , is a straight forward man, and is very concerned with the care and treatment of all 7 of our dogs.  We trust no one else but him,  we have been with him over 15 years. His prices are honest, and fair.</text>

<Text>My family has gone to Olive Vet hospital since the 60's, yes he can be very busy, yes he errs on the side of caution and because he does not charge a lot, I get sticker shock when I go other places. I live in Texas now and if I could I would take all my pets to them because I know they will get the best and most humane treatment in town</Text>< user>

<Text>I came because it was recommended and they took one look at my tattoos and other mods they claimed to"not be accepting" any more animals" but there was no one else there. When I asked when I could come back they made more excuses as to why they wouldn't service my cat. You guys are disgusting... I'm a teacher for Christ sake.

< Review>
My family has taken all of our dogs and cats to Olive Vet for many years, first to Dr. Suda senior and now to his son, Michael. I have been to Vets in other cities but have never experienced the excellent care that Dr. Michael gives to our pets and he has never over billed as so many local Vets do. He has a very busy practice as there are obviously many people who recognize an excellent Vet and person. Also, Maggie and David who work in the office are always just as pleasant and helpful.

Dr. Suda has been 'our' veterinarian after the passing of his father. He has never failed to be totally attentative and complete in the care of our animals. I always receive 'call backs' concening visits, medications, etc. his care is reasonably priced in consideration of his clients - so rare these days. His assistant (Maggie) is a perfect fit for the office. She does a wonderful job considering what her 'duties' are: the most difficult I would imagine is having to see and give news to all of the 'parents' of the patients when it is not always 'good news'. I appreciate him and wanted to let him and his team know! Keep up the fantastic care to Dr. Suda and his team.</text>

Wanted to go to a pumpkin farm that wasn't an hour drive.  This seasonal farm is catered to families.  There r jumpy houses, merry-go- round (for toddlers), petting zoo, pumpkin shooting, human hamsterballs, face painting and slides.  Plus, the view of SF is beautiful.   Parking is free and u can get bbq from a food truck.  What a nice way to spend the day.</Text>

<Review>Unfortunately they moved locations and their quality went down the drain with it. It use to be an amazing pumpkin patch by the water with many activities tons of pumpkins and an overall great time. Now that they moved locations it is small, the pumpkin selection is limited, everything was dirty, all they had were inflatable jumpers and a pumpkin cannon. The quality of this pumpkin patch really went down the drain this year. After 5 years if visiting this pumpkin patch this will be our last. Sad to see a gem dwindle into a bad experience</Review>< name>

<Text>They let us in free bc it was the end of the night, it was nice but a little boring as there wasn't any activities aside from the $12 unicorn lightsaber and hatchet throwing . I should be thanked for not allowing my kid to hold a hatchet 🪓😲 But overall it was nice to get out after being couped up.< /Text>< rate>

Wonderful! This place is pretty spacious, and dog friendly! Many choices to choose from, and for pretty good prices. Lots of activities to do for children, very family friendly.</review>

It's okay they got me some slightly over priced pumpkins but they were nice and helpful. They had fun stuff for kids as well but I think it was a little lack luster maybe a 4 is more acurate but for now it's a 3 cause 3.5 doesn't exist< /Text>

<Review>This patch is pretty standard, but lacks some of the charm or a good pumpkin patch. Pumpkins are priced a little high and adult activities are lacking. Pumpkin discovery and selection is pretty bad. I'd drive out of my way to go somewhere else.</Review>< pictures>

<rate>2</rate><text>Right across street from Bessie Coleman. No matter how we feel about Hellenween and Pumkins to kids and teens they had a ball on the weekens. I have to give my hands off to the DJ on the weekends the corner turned onto block party. The public who went to  Pumkin Farm enjoyed themself, music and socializing. See you next year

The Xmas Tree group needs to learn from the Pumkin Farm. Even though the weather condition haven't been the best for the Xmas Tree Lot its a bite dull. What no Nelson song:"Grandmother was ran over by a raindeer" by favorite or 12 days of black sale bargins or returns and a partridge in a pear tree. Sorry can't rap. Next holiday New Years Eve fire works weather permits.💥🍺🎅<//text>< pics>

< Review>
This place is a scam $20 fir wristband so my kid can go on only 2 of the attractions. Yes he can go on it multiple times but $20. Then theres the little section of animals that you have to pay to feed them ? I have to pay to feed your animals. Not real friendly, not real clean, like they didnt giva a shoot. Some employees selling wristbands under the table and pocketing $$ like i said a scam, very disappointed.< /Review>

<user_name>Lauren Edwins<//user_name><date>1539735625905</date><Review>Not a pumpkin patch; just a bunch of pumpkins for sale in a parking lot. Extremely misleading advertising. I didn't look at photos--my mistake. However, I read a bunch of reviews and not one person mentioned this.

This "pumpkin patch" is just a little bit of hay with a few pumpkins strewn here and there. The type of thing you would go to on Christmas if you were looking for a tree.

There were a few playstructures that kids would be interested in, but I was looking for a pumpkin patch. Don't go here if you're actually searching for a farm. Speer Family Farms is a farm in name only.</Review>< Rating>

This place was located in a very odd place near the navy base. Lots of pumpkin selections and things for kids to do. But overall not a great place for adults. Pumpkin shooters was like $7 for one shot. Got some fun photos but likely wouldn't go back.</Review>

We had lots of fun here. Adults don't pay for rides if they are with kids which is nice. We were here for 1.5 hours and found plenty to do. I was with a 2 year old so traveling alone takes time.< /Text>

This is the best pumpkin patch we've been to. Not because of the pumpkins, but because it's a big pop-up fun park for kids with huge inflatable slides and bounce houses. Our 4-year-old had a blast.</Review>

<Rate>1</Rate><Review>Awful experience here. The power is run on generators for all the bounce houses and apparently it's status quo for the generators to go out while your kids are inside the inflatables. My two kids were in a bounce house and when the power went out that thing deflated so fast! Ok, no big deal, right? Except that all the other kids panicked and were trampling each other and the person monitoring that particular bounce house ran away!! Ran away, people!! That left several parents scrambling to hold up the bounce house and get all of our kids out by ourselves, no employees to be seen except for at the front of the entrance simply talking to each other. My kids were so frightened, we left immediately - never again!<//Review>< Pics>

Free admission in this lovely pumpkin patch, we quick forget that we are on a parking lot. You can have a lot of fun without the paid activities.< /Review>

The pig at petting zoo bit my daughter's leg. It was terrifying and the keeper wasn't bothered. Barely said sorry. That petting zoo is a liability.</Text>

It's ok, they have a decent selection of pumpkins, food, and kids entertainment.  The issue is they only have one person at the register for everything except food.  You spend most of your time here in line.</Review>

< Review>
I was in the bay area on business and had a few too many at a business lunch in chinatown, stumbled out into the bright daylight and dialed up an uber on my phone. It arrived and I fell asleep in the back. I guess I put in the wrong address because we ended up here, where I woke up to the driver yelling at me to get out. I obliged him and before i got my bearings he had driven away. The pumpkin patch was closed, but I was intrigued and stumbled in. As I wandered amongst the pumpkins and gourds, I just couldn't comprehend such a thing in alameda. My head started to hurt so I laid down on some straw bales and took a little rest while I waited for my lyft driver to arrive, which he shortly did - clearly amused and curious how I found myself there. He was discrete however and didn't inquire, so we rode in silence.

I had actually forgotten about this until google suggested I review the place and it all came flooding back.

Three stars only due to it not being open and the sense of existential dread and confusion the experience caused. Good for kids.</Review>

Not what I expected. I guess it works if you do not have access to an actual farm but it felt out of place on the old naval base.< /Text>

Do not go for the bouncy house, it was in terrible shape and wet. There was nothing else there for the kiddos. The trees were in bad condition too and service was chaotic.  We were really disappointed.</review>

<review>My daughter and I went to this place to fix a tire on her car, we both went in our own car.
When it was time to pay the main guy made us to go to the bank to get cash because he didnt know how to use the debit card machine demanding to stay one of us like guarantee that we wouldn't leave without paying. My daughter went to the bank and after several minutes i had to leave to work warning to him no to say nothing to my daugher because he was being VERY RUDE USING BAD WORDS (i wonder if he is the same with the men)  frustrated because we were using  a bank card. My daughter got back to pay but we both came late to my job and my daughter to school.
VERY RUDE AND UNPROFESSIONAL.  NEVER AGAIN!</review><Pics>None</Pics><Gmap_id>0x80c33212445f1e6d:0x3b508849bcb309d6<//Gmap_id><date>1552487311854< /date><userid>100078215477421169159< /userid><rating>1</rating>< Name>

This is a shady business. My tire needed a patch for a regular price of $15 and it took an average amount of time to be done, but then I noticed it wasn't my tire. I looked at the other 3 tires and the tire he installed was a different brand. He must've switched it for a cheaper tire! Stay away from this place!<//Text>

Went to replace my tires. They quoted me $25 per tire. They ended up scratching my rim, were not able to install my tire, did not fit the scratched rim, and doubled the price of installation to $55 at the end.< /text>

This business is the worst place ive ever done business with!! I took my car in for an alignment because i had just bought all new tires and they told me i needed a camber kit for my car so i figured since their the so called mechanics that they were right. They charged me around $400.00 for the camber kit, installation and alignment. When i showed up to pick up my car they told me it was ready so i drove off and as soon as i did my steering wheel was tilting all the way to the left and my car was making some weird noise. So they didnt even test drive my car after the work was done to it. I drove it back and they lifted the car and were just wispering to each other like something was wrong. They then tell me that i have to replace other parts in order to get it fixed correctly. I took my car to two other places which i had to pay to get it looked at and they told me that the car could not be aligned because the camber kit was installed incorrectly. The shop used a blow torch on the frame of the car to install the camber kit and they made the holes to big so that ment that camber kit was loose and the car would always drive to the side and the steering wheel would always tilt. My frame was no good any more since the wholes were to big. I went back and talked to the owner and he didnt want to deal with me, he said come back and deal with the guy who installed the kit but he would be back next week. I told him that was not profesional and that i would contact the better business bureau. He simply said do what you want. I ended up taking my car else where and had to spend another $400 to replace the bottom frame of my car. It turned out my car didnt even need a camber kit, they just said that to make more money off me. This place is nothing but a scam and they are crooks.I lost about $1000 just for dealing with this so called business. Dont do business here, you will get riped off like i did.<//review>

<review>Expensive very expensive and they aren't sure about their prices, they'll give you a price then change it to a higher price then ask you what you think is a fair price, and then they'll go back and stick to their expensive price if "it's a lot of work" just to mount a tire.< /review></record>

I've had Peter's Kettle Corn once but the kettle corn was so good the bag was gone in one day by me because it was so delicious. I would not give a better rating to any other popcorn place than Peter's. The kettle corn was absolutely AMAZING!!! It was the most wonderful popcorn I have ever tasted . There is no better place than Peter's Ktttle Corn. If you haven't been to Peter's, you should absolutely go. I give it a million stars.</Review>

<Text>Peters popcorn is more than just a local popcorn shop... When I visit I can expect to be met with a warm greeting each and every time! Not only is the popcorn the all time best in the bay area, the customer service is outstanding! Thank you Peter along with your friendly staff for remarkable customer service and for the best popcorn ever! I love the buffalo cheddar... I just wish that it was available daily!

<Review>Never in my wildest dreams did I think a popcorn store would be so delicious.
This small, local shop is easy enough to find and to find parking for.  The guy behind the counter was knowledgeable and totally willing to let us sample every popcorn available.  The popcorn was delicious, and honestly, the largest popped corn pieces I've ever seen.  They're really big!   I loved  the kettle corn the best, my kids loved the caramel one.
While we were there, a steady amount of people went in and out.  When there were 3 people in the store, another person came out from the back to assist, just as friendly as the first one.  Their customer service was spot on.
Movie night, game night, whatever day or night, even as a Xmas gift, this popcorn is worth stopping to check out.  it truly is delicious.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics></record></dataset><record>

Flavors like Maple Bacon (a house specialty and my personal favorite), spicy cheddar,  sea salt carmel, truffle white chocolate,  and much more.  All served by a friendly smiling staff.  This popcorn is sure to tingle your taste buds and sweet tooth. And it's worth every dime.<//Text>< Pics>

The best popcorn experience in the bayarea for me yet it was great and we'll price I bought a large bag to try and to share with family at home and I live not to far from Oakland and a nearby city and by the time i got home there was none left to share so I had to do the ratings alone lol I will recommend at least try the corn and you won't mind picking the corn cornel out of your teeth</review>

< Review>
I have been looking for employment for quite a while. Other agencies didn't get me anything, not even a temporary placement. Since I started with Express, I have been working. When one assignment ends, they find another that suits my skills. They're the best employment agency I have ever worked with. Thank you Gabby, Nancy and staff in the Oxnard office for your hard work.</Review>

Great spot to find temp or temp to hire positions.  Gabby was extremely professional and thorough with the process.  She was able to find exactly the type of position i was looking for.  Literally took less than a week.  If you are in need of employment or assistance in finding the right kind of job/career,  look no further than Express!</Review>

I was helped by a lady named Veronica and she was very nice and kept things very professional and answered any questions I needed help with. I finished with a lady named Brenda who was also very polite and helpful. I loved the energy they both had. I recommend this staffing agency to anyone looking to find a job.<//Review>

< review>
Guadalupe is the best recruiter, since she has been my recruiter she has helped me multiple of times.  I was unemployed, getting on my feet and had just moved in to a new place. I didn't know how I was going to be able to pay rent.  I called her and she came through. She gave me a short term assignment that paid me 30 hrs in 2 days.  Thanks to her I am not going to lose my place.   Now she has placed me in a company that is stable and I can do over time. Guadalupe, don't care what walk of life you come from . If you really want to work and want to do better she will Genuinely help you.  I will be forever great full to her.</review>

<review>Guadalupe Ramirez was very helpful, worked very fast and was very understanding on what I liked and did not like. She’s literally the best recruiter ever, once I was unemployed and talked to her we got everything ready and within the next morning of I had two interviews that fit into my schedule. Very satisfied.</review>< pictures>

Nancy Weintraub is the BEST,after months of searching she had my back and looked out for my better interests right off the bat and helped me land a job even better than the one I lost to covid. I lost my job due to the bad economic situation in 2008 and she helped me then too!!</Review>

<review>Let me start by saying I was nervous about going to my internal interview as it was. I had already completed my associate process that morning. Mind you not I had already spoke to two different recruiters for the position I was applying. This interview was with the general manager “Mayra” as I went in the back office with her I felt uncomfortable, she had already given me a bad look. She started off by saying why was I there when she New I was applying for her open position. During my interview she made me feel I had nothing to bring to the table, I felt judged without her even wanting to hear from me. Mayra raised her voice at me without letting me finish my sentence from her same question. She made me feel like she was even being racist towards me she is Mexican as well. She definitely needs to humble herself and have respect with out judging anyone. I seriously cannot imagine how her employees are treated. I can’t believe my poor friend in acquaintance works there.</review><gmapID>0x80e84c5155555555:0xa3dbb77ef403da54</gmapID>< user_id>

They have always provided quick submittal of great quality candidates that line up very well with the jobs we were needing. Many of those candidates have been hired on as permenant employees over the years due to their great work ethic and loyalty to their job.
Many temporary employees who have come through Express have also mentioned to me that they enjoyed working with Express and referred many others to them to find work. Through that, I myself have referred friends to them when I hear of someone getting out into the job search.
I greatly recommend them for all your staffing needs from warehouse positions to office staff support.<//Text>< Pictures>

Started in 1000 oaks office with Edgar. He is the man and will keep u working. He actually suggested I try the Oxnard office so I did. Went in  on the 23rd of September and signed up with Nancy dela mora and I haven't heard from her since even after leaving a voicemail on her service. It's October 8th, I'm just saying. very unprofessional. I  could tell as soon as I walked through the door that the experience was not going to be good the way business was conducted there. I would definitely recommend Edgar at the t.o. office because he's committed to keeping you employed. Dont waste your time at the Oxnard office.

This place is a joke , at least the young women in the front and place is like a zoo, I had my job listed on Cal jobs and express contacted me , I didn't contact them , I'm a class A driver with over ten years of experience, so I was under the impression I was there for an interview, lady I spoke to (not gonna mention her name) said come in at 330 pm for an interview, get there at 3 pm and I'm filling out paperwork and paperwork and more paperwork, been there for an hour and still no interview, healthy set lady in front says what's the rush you're still gonna be here for an hour and a half!!???! That's something you might wanna let that person know ahead of time, I got kids and things to do . Walked out of that kaotic place I'm good I think I can find a job on my own without the unprofessionals at express.< /Text>

<text>A very unprofessional environment. I am very disappointed and dissatisfied with the time i have been with express oxnard location. There has been multiple times where they have been late on pay/no pay, even when i have worked 40+hours. I would have to wait a week and sometimes 2 weeks just for a week of pay. its annoy and highly unprofessional, if i were you looking for a job at a temp agency, do NOT (and i cant stress this enough) work with express “professionals” instead go across the street to Primeskills staffing and they will set u right. I never have ever took the time to do a review  whether it was a bad or good experience but im here to say working with express for 3 yrs now. DO NOT TRY THEM.</text>< Pictures>

I was recommended for a job at North Ranch Country Club in Westlake CA. I was interviewed and got the job right away based on favorable comments from Isis Guido at Express Employment Professionals in Thousand Oaks CA.The job was demanding but within my capabilities, I worked 6 hours and was praised by my supervisor for a job well done, I have been asked to come back at a later date to continue in the same job. This has been a great introduction to Express Employment Professionals.  Adela Fuggles</Review>

{'time': 1514577323210, 'text': 'Monique, we strive hard to provide excellent customer service to each and every associate and try to match them with the best possible job opportunities based on their experience and interests. I am delighted to see that we found you the right job opportunity that you enjoy and look forward to converting to full time.\n\nI am sorry to hear that you were unhappy about how your pay situation was handled. Unfortunately, as your time card hours were submitted well after payroll closed, we had no choice but to manually calculate your pay and as part of that process we had to withhold a portion for both State and Payroll taxes and other burden costs (which have to be estimated). I understand how that may look as if you were short paid, however that was not actually the case, as we tried to explain in the various follow-up conversations with you and e-mails we sent you.\n\nI appreciate that all the payroll burden deductions can be very confusing, especially when they have to be calculated after the normal payroll process has been completed. As you know, I spoke with you personally on the phone to try to explain why and how the process works for late time card hours processing. Nevertheless, in order to ensure your total satisfaction with our service, I decided to pay you $200 immediately to reimburse your taxes, plus a little extra.\n\nOn Tuesday January 2nd, in response to a further inquiry you made about refunding your taxes, we sent you a detailed breakdown of all payments made to you plus taxes paid which clearly indicates that you did actually receive all payments due to you, and that in addition, Express effectively paid for all your taxes plus a little extra for goodwill to try to ensure you would be 100% satisfied with our service.\n\nHowever, if you are still not satisfied or if there is anything else I can do, I would be happy to discuss with you or meet with you personally to review all the numbers. Please feel free to call me at 805-418-1111. I look forward to hearing from you.\n\nNeil McMillan'}</Response>

Manager Mau has a great attitude when I have an issue. She always seems so attentive and genuinely concerned about any issues I may have. I really like whenever she’s in the office because I know if I need something and she’s there, she’ll help me no hesitation. Thanks for helping an old lady out.</review>

<text>I’ve used this storage a few times in the past few years and Mel has been here the whole time to help me. I’ve gone through a separation and had to store here, a death and had to store here again, and now that I’m buying my second home I will need to use this storage again. Over the years I’ve enjoyed coming to this location because I’m always glad to see Mel and we always end up updating each other on all the things we’ve been going through since our last meeting. She really does make these situations that happen in life that brings us to needing storage, a whole lot more pleasant. Thank you so much.<//text><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None<//response>< gmap_id>

I wasn’t sure how to go about choosing a unit size since I didn’t have many things so she helped me decide which unit best fits my needs. My unit is very close by the front gate and on a corner so it’s very convenient for myself and has easy access!

P.S. I added photographs to this post of the ant and rat infestation in my rented unit yesterday. Today, they have been removed by management. They have the ability to censor their cutomers reviews! They do not want potential customers to see the real conditions of their storage facility. Please read my original review here:

Firstly, I found the staff friendly and helpful and therefore this review is not directed at any individual at the facility but to the corporation of Public Storage.
I rented the space 13 months ago for $257 per month and moved in my belongings. At that time, I was disturbed to see a group of people nearby wearing masks as they moved out contents from another unit. I was curious and asked the lady what was so hazardous that they were wearing masks. She explained that the unit was rat infested and a lot of damage was sustained to their belongings as a result. I was disturbed by this news but tried to reassure myself that there were no holes in my unit where rats could enter. Later I realized I was mistaken!
The reason I finally left the unit was due to 2 rent increases within a year. The first after 4 months from $257 to $317. The second came 8 months later taking the rent from $317 to $416. overall that is a 62% increase within a year. I was a good tenant and the rent was paid by direct debit.
I decided quickly and moved my stuff out: It was then that I found that my unit was also rat infested and swarming ants too.  Rat droppings and urine stains everywhere. Most of my belongings were safely boxed however; but mattresses and bedding were not and suffered. I estimated the damage at $700.
A telphone call to Public Storage Management resulted in their claiming no responsibility for this loss. They were aware that this facility was infested and had ineffectual rat traps situated all around the property. However, they suggested I claim losses off my personal insurance. I believe that there is a breach of contract in Public Storage's failure to exercise duty of care towards their tenants' health and property. Tenants may be at risk from health hazards related to rodent infestation and not least, damage to their property.
I would advise others, who may need temporary storage of their belongings, to think twice before using this facility.
They are not even worthy of one star in this review.<//text>

Damien was very helpful to me . I had never used public storage services before and was nervous . He was kind enough to  all processes to me. I really appreciate his personal customer service expertise, he went out of his way to show me my unit and even helped me set in .

Thank you so much Damien . Over I would recommend folks to use public storage, they gave me a great deal and even though I reached out to them at the last minute. The site manager was courteous enough to find me a unit within time and offered me their promotion rate .

Thank you so much .< /text>

This is a great storage location. Jennifer of the office staff was so helpful and informative from when I first booked online. She phoned me within a couple of hours of the booking. We set up an appointment. She showed me a very nice and large storage unit for a very competitive price. Jennifer was so quick and efficient with all of the paperwork and describing in detail the payment options, insurance and other pertinent information. It was so user friendly. I recommend this location and the customer service oriented staff for any and all interested.

Sincerely,
Robert Rush</Text>

< Review>
Good team working at this location. I needed a storage unit for a move, and quickly realized the unit I rented was way too small for my needs.  The team helped me transition to a larger unit the same day and was patient when I had to stay a bit later than closing time.  They helped me find promotional discounts as well, which made the moving experience easier.  Good team and good follow-up when I have questions. UPDATE:  After going back and forth numerous times, as well as with the regional manager "Chuck", PS did not honor the promotion stated, claiming a technicality (I was already a "customer", since I opened the account hours earlier, therefore they could not offer the better discount).  PS upper management also claimed that an "Amy" had contacted me to inform me directly that I wouldn't be getting the discount, which was not true. Had to call to correct late payment mix-up as the communication was very bad and not very professional.  I was told that I would be contacted again by "Amy" (Chuck's manager), but that never happened.   Honestly, how hard is it to understand that sometimes your need a bigger unit when you are moving things into it?  When I called to initially inquire about renting a unit, I was told that a 10x10 would be fine for the size of the house.  It wasn't even close, so I had to upgrade.  How greedy is PS when they go for the money and piss off a repeat customer?   They were 5 stars initially but 2 stars now.  Upper mgmt needs to get a better clue.<//Review>

I'm a frequent customer who comes and stores every other few months and have always came here first because Mau makes storing here such a pleasure. She knows me by my name and her attention to my needs makes me feel like I'm the only customer she has. Prices can be cheaper but I'd say her customer service helps for paying that bill every month.< /text>

<Review>My sister has been storing here for years and many times I come to pay her storage. Everytime I come Mau always greets me with a warm smile and is always so polite and professional. She has really great cusier service.

My sister had an issue with her lock on her door, she must've locked it incorrectly the last time she went to her storage. Mau called her the very next day and let us know she put an extra lock on the storage so that it wouldn't still be open. My sister came that same day and Mau showed her how to lock it the right way. I feel my sister's things really are safe here especially with so much attention to each storage locker. Thanks so much.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None<//Response><gmapID>0x8085786b8b1fe485:0xbdec31d299bbf311</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Hours later I come to the office where she welcomed me and explained all what needed to be done in a clear friendly manner. Then she showed me couple units to choose from the one that fit my needs.
The next morning I come to the office to sign my papers where I meet Shasta the office staff, who is awesome. She welcomed me with a friendly smile on her face and went with me thru the contracts and the insurance again.  Then she showed me the unit and other once to finalize my thoughts and decision before I sign the contract.
On my moving day I got some technical difficulties with the unit I signed for. However I was fortune enough to meet Shasta at the office again.  5 minutes later she was able to arrange for me a new unit and I was set up to go.
I really find that, Shasta and Sabrina have all these customer service skills that make customers feel respected and well served.

Thank you again for the top customer service. I definitely would recommend the location to all my friends and colleagues.< /text>< Pics>

<Text>I particularly want to commend Mauelua at this location. I had a malfunction with the door to my unit and needed it to be repaired while I was away. Mau took care of the issue with dispatch and organized the contents of my unit in my absence so that the door would not jam again. In addition, this location is clean and well maintained. The other staff I have dealt with, Damien, was also very professional.</Text><gmapID>0x8085786b8b1fe485:0xbdec31d299bbf311<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Milan The Manager was very knowledgeable of the units and helped me make the right choice in finding the right unit. I wasn't excited about the location at first but it is actually pretty secure. She made me feel comfortable about doing business there and explained all of my options. Thanks! Milan< /Review>

<review>Tarynn really knows her stuff and is so organized I was checked in and out in half the time I thought.  The paperwork was simple and clear and her presentation was easy to understand, and covered the various details (locking, supplies, insurance, payment dates) thoroughly - I can still remember them!  The facility overall is very clean and I'll be looking forward to having open space in the house with our (overflow) books and craft supplies stored here.</review>< rating>

Not satisfied.
1.  The rubber seal on the roll up door was broken and mice would enter my unit.  Management said they would repair the seal.  I had to call district manager, Iris Coleman several times (she never returned my call).  Took 2-3 months to repair the seal.  Really?

2.  Regarding the mice, there was a hole inside of my unit that allowed mice to travel from one unit to the inside of the next unit and to the next unit.  The hole was there by design.  Management said they would set out poison but the dead mice would cause a foul order in my unit.  I had to rig a system to catch and dispose of the mice.  And I had to fix the hole myself with sheet metal.  Really?

3.  The latch on the outside of the door had been pried (attempted burglary).  When I asked the manager to fix the latch, she handed me a pop-rivet gun and said, "You can fix it.  We don't do that."  Really?

4.  The rent goes up every year.  My rent went up by $40-$45 per month each year.  When my rent went up to $583 per month, I discovered that others were paying $180-$373 per month for the same size unit.  When I complained to the manager, she requested a rate increase cancellation on my account and said come back in a few months and request a rate reduction.  In the mean time I was still paying $200 more per month than others with the same size unit.  Really?

The staff was friendly and helpful, but the corporate level is horrible.  For $545 I not satisfied with Public Storage.

See attached pics.

Public Storage is a rip (corp greed), don't rent.  If you do have to rent, get out as soon a possible.  I wonder if this post will see the light of day.

On 10-11-19 I requested a rate reduction, since the current rate is $420 per month and I am paying $545 per month.  On 10-16-19 I was informed that my rate was reduced to $490.  So Why am I still paying $70 more than the current rate?  Really?

Don't rent.  Public Storage is a rip!</text>

I rented here once before and loved it, it was very clean and secure. I came back to check on prices because I'm moving soon and the ladies here are lovely. Jennifer answered all of my questions and Tamika showed me several units. They also have the cheapest prices around. If your looking for a place to store this is it...and ask for Tamika or Jennifer.< /text>

My experience with public storage has been absolutely great. Tamika has made the storage expense stress free. Her customer service skills are extraordinary. I love public storage.< /text>

Great service today with Teila. Made a reservation prior to coming into the location and she was very responsive. We received a call from her confirming the reservation shortly after the reservation was made.</review>

<text>Tamika and Jennifer are very helpful and knowledgeable about a lot of things.Anytime I have had a problem like not locking my storage correctly they were sure to notify me and the next time I came in they showed me how to put it on correctly. You couldn't ask for better employees. They put their all in their job.Tamika and Jennifer are on top of their job leaving nothing to chance.< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><gmap_id>0x8085786b8b1fe485:0xbdec31d299bbf311< /gmap_id></record>

My unit got robbed and the manager towed my vehicle when I had a tow truck on the way. Unit was dirty and nasty. I was assaulted by staff and staffs family. Most horrible experience ever. Got evicted with no notice or paperwork. Had insurance and still waiting for claim to get paid.<//text>

When I came in the office a few days ago the property manager jennifer had her kids in the office which I found to be unprofessional. She was extremely rude and did not seem to care that there was a customer. I will not recommend anyone ever 😡</Review>

Make the trip into the TenderLoin! This candy place is so worth it! They have coffee drinks too. There were scones and I think they were also serving a bread pudding dessert. This place is open till the daily batch is gone so get there morning/early afternoon---I think we got there at about 11:30AM and there was still plenty to choose from. You will not be disappointed with any of their caramel-chocolatey candies-each one I tried was great. Very unique names and just a very old school interesting vibe. An SF must.<//Text>

Hooker's Sweet Treats is my favorite place for special salted chocolate caramels.  There isn't anything better.  It is the perfect place to buy a unique, special treat or gift for someone.  I do not want to see Hooker's close.</Text>

HOWEVER: PLEASE, PLEASE expand your hours.  Would love to be able to hang out here in the early evening.  Something like this could really turn around the area.<//text>< pictures>

I saw an ad on a bus and being the candy lover I am, I stopped in to check it out. It was a lot smaller than I thought it would be and the prices were crazy high. And, the selection was just ok. Most of the sours and gummies are in jars, so I wasn't really sure how to pick anything out. Everything seemed more of a display than options. It is cute and ya gotta support your local candy store, but I won't go back expressly for a Hooker's Sweet Treats run.<//Review>

<review>Home away from home, this little nook is definitely a hook. You must try a sweet treat because your mouth will be hooked immediately. I tried a caramel pecan bar and an iced coffee which is served on a real plate and in a clear glass mug, just like home. Make sure you check out the wooden shelf; there are some interesting antiques on display.</review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

< Review>
This truly is a San Francisco gem. All of my out-of-town friends and family have come to know Hooker's because I always bring them treats when I visit. They serve sight glass, which is delicious, but if you prefer non-fat milk with your espresso you are out of luck.< /Review>

Great coffee and chocolate!  My wife and I walked in by chance and she was immediately hooked by the sea salt caramel chocolate that was available. We added two cappuccinos and we're off. Before we could leave, we had to get a wonderful smelling scone. A definite treat in SF.< /review>

<Review>This was a delightful find that my GF made while watching a cooking show. We tried pretty much everything on their menu and enjoyed everything.
I had the cheddar bisquit and thoroughly enjoyed it. The Coffees we had were good and obviously the sweet treats were very good.
So good, we bought some to take home with us to So Cal.<//Review>< Pics>

This place sells some of the best chocolate anywhere but what they are famous for is the saltes caramel they sell. It is all handmade and is absolutely delightful. You can get it fully covered in chocolate or only part dipped. Despite its location in the dangerous Tenderloin area, I cannot recommend highly enough a trip here during the dailight hours.

Another SF must visit<//Text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><text>I would go here every day if they were opened on Mondays! Although their hours are a bit odd (not opened on Mondays, close at 4, etc.) it is a bit understandable in the Tenderloin. It's a small shop and the baristas and cook take great pride in their work and it shows. The caramels are delicious and the coffee is always on point. I've had their scones but have yet to try their bread pudding (I hear it's AMAZEBALLS) or breakfast options (I believe they are available on the weekends). They purposefully do not have wifi here which is a bummer, but again understandable. Definitely recommend this spot if you are looking for a good roast or something sweet.< /text><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

<Review>Best bread pudding!
Hooker is a great guy. From the Deep South Bayou Teche. He makes delicious caramels, cookies, and bread pudding du jour. My favorite is the lemon blueberry bread pudding. Ask him for the lagniappe.
Hook can teach you a lot about southern manners, sweets, love, life, mexico and the list goes on! So stop in here for a chat!
Leave your ipad and laptop at home.
Much obliged,
Hook big kiss mwah!

<review>Pizza is great and so are all the employees whom are working at this Pizza Hut. Each certainly goes above and beyond in Customer Service. In all my experiences, I have never been disappointed. The Delivery Drivers always arrive on time and are often early. I'm also about to take advantage of the free pizza deals for ordering often. Thx so much!</review>< pics>

<review>Ramona Pizza Hut delivers to the Estates.
Im very happy about that.
Online orders placed for delivery in the Estates may give you a prompt that reads "There are no stores that deliver to this area" put the Pizza Hut Address for the delivery address. Then call the store to correct the address or they will call you. Thanks Marisa.
Food and service have been fine.
Over several orders we received what we ordered in the time frame indicated for delivery.<//review><UserId.>105315399447355890872<//UserId.></record>

Food has been great every time with veggie and vegan options. Substantial menu selection with a mostly accommodating staff. Though sometimes when the lines get long they can get focused and a little chaotic, like most places. Highly recommended for a slow relaxing day when you aren't in a hurry and have time to take in the scenery.<//review>< pics>

Came to San Fran for the weekend, we asked the front desk of our hotel where to go for breakfast and they recommended this place. My dad and I had the fried egg sandwich with fresh orange juice and he had coffee and it was so delicious. He said it was the best coffee he's had at a restaurant. We will definitely be returning when we visit SF again.<//text>

Food is overpriced but, marginally, better than average. Very slow service cancels out any hope that the high prices are worth it. Waited 30+ minutes for a kid's hotdog, mac and cheese, PB&J and breakfast burrito...on a Monday. 35 minutes to be exact...<//Review>

< Review>
Thai Iced Tea 95/💯!  Dolores Egg Sandwich 🥪 96/💯. \n

It's been a great #coffeeweek  🤝☕🙂 for me, and Thai Tea is a great substitute for when you're over-caffeinated btw. You can drink it here 😁 in a quiet setting with nice staff members! \n

Being in the same neighborhood as cool startup-y people is fun. And while it's tempting to allude more specifically whoever I may or may not have met this week, I've learned that discretion is the name of the game in #SF #SV... I used my  🧠 and my  📱  to understand this. \n

The outdoor patio seating and the large open windows with view of Dolores park and the high school get it 4 stars alone. Pretty pricey but that’s what you get for going to an upscale cafe on the corner of Dolores park. Pretty solid beer and wine selection as well for a post tennis or park beverage if you didn’t bring your own booze of choice to the park already.</text>

Atmosphere: great. beautiful views, great natural lighting, all-age friendly and spacious.

Location: perfect! Easy to find and within close proximity to public transport.

Food: limited plant-based / allergen-friendly items. While they can sub things out, don’t have a robust selection of full dishes which qualify.

They also charge extra for plant-based milks which means they get a few stars knocked off.< /Review>

We are working on more vegan and gluten free items this summer so hang tight. We have many insanely delicious pastries that are both vegan and gluten free. Regarding sandwich subs our items our include potatoes, salads, soup (often gf) and chips as we are a salad and sandwich cafe. We do suggest Gracias Madre and Ananda Fuara if you are looking for a space that is geared strictly towards a plant based lifestyle. They are both fantastic. We do charge extra for plant based "milks" as our costs are much higher than dairy. We hope you will give us another try in the future! Our best to you--'}< /resp>

Extensive organic menu and delicious, healthy and fresh food. They provide farmed chicken, ham, bacon and beef. Eggs they use are cage-free. Dolores Breakfast Sandwich was super good. There are assorted juices, coffees, teas, and healthy brunch options for customers.< /Text>

8.04 for a dirty Chai that was finished by the same person that took My order in less than a minute (literally counted back the 96 cents) ,  tasted like cinnamon and a dash of lukewarm milk on top of a drip coffee ... have been here a dozen times or so and always nearly good or not at all.</review>

< Review>
I ordered the granola and yogurt, expecting a mediocre, small cup of mostly yogurt and sub-par granola and fruit for more money than it was worth. I was so pleasantly surprised. The serving was not only a very gracious portion that was suitable to be an entire meal, but it was so fresh and delicious. There were mango cubes, sliced banana, and strawberries atop a beautiful and delicious homemade granola, surrounded by yogurt. My friends ordered egg dishes, and while they were good, we all agreed that I won the best breakfast! I only wish I had taken a photo, but it was so delicious that I’d go out of my way to return if I visit the city again!</Review>

Good food, good friendly service, GREAT location. You can't get much better than sitting next to one of the best parks in San Francisco while drinking a latte and reading a good book on a sunny day. Unless of course you were enjoying a glass of wine instead.

This place is centrally located in the heart of the Mission and worth a stop in.< /Text>

I just ate here for my first time and it was incredible. I had The Standard breakfast sandwich and it was amazing- open-face with perfect scrambled eggs, melted cheddar cheese and bacon strips- perfection. The coffee is from Equator which is my favorite brand, the latte I had was great. Every employee was gracious, warm and friendly- I'm so hooked already. GO!!!< /Review>

One of my favorite places for delicious cafe food. Entered near ten, it was not crowded. I had a cousin come into town and she asked me to go back here. It has a good interior.< /review>

I'm a huuuuge coffee drinker. I used to work as a barista when I was in uni for 4 years. So I'm obsessed with coffee. I went here today for a regular coffee and a double espresso for my mother in law.....the coffee was bitter. I couldn't even finish it. My mother in law asked me where I got the coffee cause she didn't like her espresso either. You would think that a place that charges so much would have quality coffee. I don't mind paying, but atleast give me something I'll enjoy.  Don't go there for just coffee. I hear the food is good!</Text>

Although one of the most prosperous regions in the world, every night thousands of people sleep on our streets. It is deeply dehumanizing to live on the street, and it’s deeply disheartening for everyone to live amid such despair. The social compact that undergirds the function of our cities has been broken.\n\nTo some, the Bay Area’s inability to solve homelessness demonstrates the failure of our progressive urbanism — a sign of our unwillingness to enforce standards of behavior on the street — along with our failed housing policy. To others, it is a symptom of a broader breakdown of American society — an expression of deep dislocations in the economy and the extremely high rates of drug use in the United States, along with a sense of despair among large swaths of the population."\n\nWe at Dolores Park Cafe care deeply about this problem. Because we know that we cannot solve this issue at hand please know that we do care deeply. We not only participate in many yearly functions raising money for several organizations, help organize food drives, for several years we have also adopted a person living on the streets that has become a friend that we provide weekly meals to. If interested in helping us with greater outreach please contact us privately. All the best--'}< /Resp>< review>

<Review>We loved this little cafe across from Dolores Park. I have read other comments that the prices were high but I wonder what they are comparing the prices with.  The fresh pressed juice prices are similar to what I’ve paid elsewhere on East and West coasts.  Other prices are similar to elsewhere in San Francisco.  Ingredients are high quality, cafe gives back to the community and is quaint, comfortable and on a great little corner across from the  Dolores Park.  Outdoor seating too!<//Review></record></dataset><record>

<review>Comfortable, casual coffee house directly across from Dolores Park.  They have a nice mix of cafe classics, coffee house favs and healthy options.  I had a great pick-me-up of fresh squeezed juice (beet & ginger) and shot of espresso.

The crowd here is really laid back and friendly.  There's a decent amount of seating inside and out.  We liked the counter help - friendly, funny and quick!< /review>< Pictures>

My friends and I came for brunch here and we really enjoyed it. The french toast was absolutely delicious. While the chairs are not the comfiest, the staff is really nice and it makes the experience worth it. It's a good place to stop by and pick up some food to take to eat at Dolores Park, which is located right across the street.<//review>

A few years ago on a sunday afternoon, my family came to visit me from Guatemala and I decided to take them to this cafe a few streets down from my neighborhood. My family found a good table.  I was in line ready to order, talking and laughing with my father about old times, when we were told by a staff member to keep our voices down. We complied despite it being lunchtime and a crowd of people were chatting with beers in their hands. My father quietly walked toward  the bulletin board while I stayed in line when the same staff member began to yell and scream at the top of her lungs that my father could not wait in line to use the bathroom. My father used the bathroom in my home before we arrived so I was a little confused. The staff member was irrate and hostile and boldly put her hands on my father who is in his 60s and forced him to go outside. The rest of my family was in shock as my father was absolutely humiliated in front of them. When i began to speak up about the matter i was met with having the police called on my family for TRESPASSING!!!  She had a huge grin on her face as she said this. We left.

Not only have i never returned to this cafe, I also try to avoid walking near it while on my way to work. You will mever see mee step foot in this establishment ever again.</Text>

< Review>
Besides it's location next to Dolores Park, I think this place is a little overrated. Their food is good, but it's a pretty limited menu.  And, they have a lot of rules - no laptops at certain tables or at certain times and there was something about the bathroom. They get so much foot traffic through here that they just want to serve as many people as possible.  They don't seem to be looking to create a loyal local crowd.</Review>

<Review>Gorgeous views, absolutely the best spot for funday Sunday in the park. There is an adorable coffee shop across the street, fun shopping and restaurants just a few blocks down and a busy but friendly daily conglomerate of people, kids, and dogs.<//Review>< rate>

<Review>Great little coffee place / diner right next to Dolores Park - I usually get my Espresso fix there early in the morning and they do a fantastic, consistent job every day. It's uneventful and not as hipster as some might like it in this neighborhood but this makes me like them even more for it. Make sure to try their muffins if you can.</Review>< pics>

<Text>Early cold morning. Sunrise. Chai tea, skim milk. Neither were charred by carelessness. Hot, but drinkable. Big warm glass to wrap my cold fingers around. Daily special chorizo burrito is delicious. The eggs aren't overcooked and the pico is fresh. The people in service are genuine. What a pleasure to start my day this way in the City.< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

<Review>I'm surprised that everyone isn't ranting and raving about this place. If you're looking for a lighter breakfast but healthy and filling then this is definitely the place to be in Mission. I wouldn't recommend driving at all but it's worth the walk.<//Review>< Pics>

Very nice location, sunny, cheerful, full of light, just facing the park. Great outdoor seating in the summer.

A little bit overpriced.

This is a great neighborhood spot, with live music, a good happy hour and tasty food.

Dolores Park Cafe is the only place in the neighborhood I've found with a great bagel sandwich that can sate this former New Yorker and I was pleasantly surprised the first time I swapped the bagel out for a baguette, winner!

I always kind of snicker to myself on weekend mornings when I walk past all the people waiting in line at Tartine, grab my delicious breakfast at Dolores Park Cafe and head back home, seeing the same people still waiting in line.< /text>

The food selection is good here. The location is awesome. The service is pretty good. It's cramped inside if it's busy, but the outside seating is nice if the weather is good. I suppose it would be nice to sit at the bar seats as well, but the tables inside feel very busy and cramped, especially if there's a long line at the cash register. That whole area feels a bit cramped though. I picture the line across the street at BiRight creamery which I have never stood in. Makes me want to run out into the park and enjoy the space.</text>

Really busy and buzzing cafe. Had a K2 smoothie and a chicken sandwich, both were pretty yummy. Nice place to get some respite from the warm weather and people watch. Not the place to be if you are seeking for peace and quiet.</text>

<text>ridiculous and annoying that they close the bathrooms for customers: this policy is just stupid and anticustomer service. never again!

Answering your reply:
unfortunately thats not accurated with the reality, neither with what I was told at the restaurant (very unfortunate by the way!). See below:
- There are many homeless and you try to avoid them come to your restaurant and use the bathrooms so you close them for everybody.
-  It wasnt one person’s mistake from your staff, at least 4 people were hearing my complaining and they confirmed the fact.
- The bathroom was not in maintenance ;)
- If the problem is the high number of visitors during the weekend then close the terrace, the kitchen, the restaurant....such a bad excuse! The restaurant is open to make profit, customers should at least be able to use the ammenities, not just paying the bill ;) is that fair?
- The restaurant was everything but full, I was the only person at the cashpoint and the only one who asked to use the bathrooms. So?
- Easy solution: give the bathroom key to the customers who ask for it so they can use it. Problem fixed, isnt this fair and easy?
- Even I insisted nobody helped me: terrible customer service, as poor as your answer. Better to apologize and find a better solution instead keep using terrible excuses

Thanks</text>< Pics>

Great food for a cafe. Right on the corner of Dolores Park, it's got a great view and people are generally in that area to have a good time so it tends to be an upbeat place to hang out.< /Review>

I was in the area and needed to grab a cup of coffee.  It's a bit confusing when we walked in because I didn't see a menu any where.  The menu is set on the wall to the left, while the register is to the right.  All we can see is a list of bagel selections.

The place is clean and pretty quiet when we were there.  The air smelled of bacon which is a big plus.< /review>

The Damage: $30-40 for two

Neighborhood corner cafe that opens early, usually frequented by the nearby residents. We liked the Standard sandwich and their smoothies

~~TRY😍:
// Pear Smoothie
// The Standard

~~OKAY🙂:
// Veggie Scramble

Horrible place!!! My girlfriend and I are visiting from NYC, we came into the shop early in the morning purchase a smoothie,  sat at a table to use the Internet.  I was tired and decided to lay my head while my partner finishes what she is doing.  I wake up to the manager Carlos,  engaged in a convo, yelling to call the cops because I was sleeping.  My girlfriend is African American, and here is Carlos which never once came by as a human to talk us ...but was fast to act like a racist with threats of cops. Why were we never approach in a humane manner?  What did we do for you to think it's ok to treat people line criminals?  Carlos you are racist! !worst experience I've had in a restaurant ever racist racist racist! !!</Review>

The food is of good quality, the atmosphere is beyond pleasant, the WiFi signal is strong, etc. It is always pleasant to visit and spend time. They serve Sight glass Coffee. I just wish they used Square so I wouldn't have to carry around receipts. It sits across the street from Bi-Rite Creamery so I often meetup with a friend to grab ice cream and sit in Dolores Park Cafe with coffee.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

Don't overlook Happy Hour, when you can enjoy that beer for less sitting in the sunny warmth and relaxing after relaxing at Dolores Park. Spoiler alert: you might spot hipsters.< /text>

You can grab a cup of coffee and enjoy the view.  There are some small tables inside and outside, but chances are that you'll have to share the comunal table.</Review>< Gmap_id>

(Translated by Google) Youthful, good breakfast. Known and frequented by the locals. In front of Dolores park where before or after you can relax and enjoy the panorama of San Francisco. Unfortunately there is only one electrical outlet in case you need to recharge tel or the like. If the bathroom is busy, the public toilets in dolores park are very clean and elegant.

(Original)
Giovanile, buona la colazione. Conosciuto e frequentato dai locali. Fronte parco Dolores dove prima o dopo puoi rilassarti e goderti il panorama di san francisco. Purtroppo esiste  solo una presa elettrica nel caso avessi bisogno di ricaricare tel o simili. Se il bagno è occupato i bagni pubblici di dolores park sono molto puliti e anche eleganti.<//text>

<Review>(Translated by Google) Going on the line of code-reading shows how consistent it is to see how it works! The first impression is wide, the decoration is quite oki check in sefile, the test is quite good! At the road where the code is mixed with few people, it is also absent when I come to the shop, only one table with my table is 2! I call matcha and jasmine milk tea! Milk tea k says the problem to say is my matcha cup! At the time the order asked me if I had more ice cream, I answered that sometimes I could not see the ice cream at all, but I asked with the invoice to look coldly and took out a cup with ice cream there! The attitude makes me quite uncomfortable! Drinks are pretty good, but the staff is not!

Đi trên đường hoà mã thấy quán thế là vào xem thử ra sao! Ấn tượng đầu tiên quán rộng ôi rộng cực luôn ý trang trí cũng khá oki check in sefile các thử khá là ổn! Ở đoạn đường hoà mã ít người qua lại nên cũng vắng lúc mình đến quán chỉ có đúng 1 bàn với bàn mình là 2! Mình gọi matcha và trà sữa hoa nhài! Trà sữa k nói cái vấn đề cần nói là cốc matcha của mình ạ! Lúc order nhân viên hỏi mình có thêm kem không mình trả lời là có lúc bê ra không thấy kem đâu cả mình hỏi với đưa hoá đơn cho xem lạnh lùng đi lấy và mang ra 1 cái cốc trong đó có viên kem thế kia! Thái độ làm mình khá khó chịu! Đồ uống cũng khá ổn nhưng nhân viên thì không ạ!<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

<Text>(Translated by Google) I did a branch.

It was like an American cafe!
The food system from coffee was also substantial.

From sandwiches to sweets

I am cheese ham sandwich
The contents were tightly packed.

There were many menus and it was fun!
