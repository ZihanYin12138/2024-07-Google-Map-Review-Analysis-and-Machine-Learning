This place is a sure go to if you’re visiting, they do have meat if you like your livestock.  There green tea is also light and invigorating and quite cheap/cost effective.</review>< Rating>

<Time>1569510917049< /Time><Review>Loved this place!. Its has a simple, chill vibe in there. Perfect for breakfast. They have an indoor and out door seating available. The food taste wonderful, very comforting, flavorful. The house coffee was not bad at all. They have non dairy option for drinks. The prices are fair $$, parking, majority are meter parking. Unless you go on a Sunday where the parking gods bestow you with "free meter parking".</Review>< Response>

I usually go to the Starbucks across the Street if I have time before my Saturday Meetings but it was packed so I thought I'd give this spot a chance. I told the girl right off the bat that I'd be doing a review and I'd love it if I could have a new place to come instead of SB. I'm in recovery and I'm Miss Sunshine. This chick was just a ball of misery. She acted as if every word I said was like nails on a chalkboard. I felt super awkward about the entire interaction. Of course I had to wait around for my bagel. . .tick. . .tock. . .tick. .
.tock. . .oh gawd. . .anywho. I asked for ice and she only filled my cup half way. Before I left I asked the nicer chick to fill it up. Bottom line: They are too busy for their own good.  Misery was probably way overworked. They just didn't stop. It REALLY affected the customer service. Misery is a hard worker no doubt. She just needs an extra set of hands around!  Don't be cheap owners!  There are people looking for work, you're working your staff to the point of misery and I personally won't come back unless I see more help and Smiles behind that counter. If I had a better experience I wouldn't have noticed how blah the bagel was.  I really do wish your business the best.  That's all I got.< /Review>

<rate>4</rate><review>The location is convenient if you're in the area but very difficult to find parking as with most thing in LA. I ordered during a not so busy time of day, with modifications on the order (that was extra), and they got the order incorrect. I have no allergies but that is very careless. But people do make mistakes time to time so that's alright.

However, the food was fantastic! The portions were delightful.

The smoothies here are top notch<//review>< Pics>

<text>Really tasty Spanish chipotle burrito, which is what I almost always get.  Not fancy but filling and tasty.

Not much of an ambiance inside so I wouldn’t go there to show a friend from out of town/host guests, but the outside seating is nice on a sunny day.  If just going for a quick bite and simple comfort food, I’d recommend.</text>< Pics>

It was immensely refreshing to see that this establishment definitely cared to provide some lighter and more wholesome options. Best of all, it was delicious!< /text></record></dataset><record>

Bland visit at best.
Hot cocoa was missing chocolate.
Cookies were old, or just extremely hard.
Counter person was missing personality.
I wouldn't go out of my way to stop in again. The menu had a variety of items that certainly sounded good, but with a big miss on hot chocolate and a couple cookies I'm not willing to chance my money. I'll spend it someplace else.<//Review>

This place is terrible.  I ordered scrambled eggs with olives and got olives with pits in my food.  Additionally the individual containers of jelly for my toast was floating in my hummus.  When a call was placed to the manager on duty, I got nothing but defensive excuses instead of a “we are sorry and how can we fix it” response.< /Text>

Delicious. Friendly. Fantastic. I ordered a pesto omlette with a side salad and a orange base smoothie with chocolate and banana.  Everything was soooo good! I'll definitely be coming back</text>

Coffee I had was extracted perfectly I was surprised however the crepes tho... Yikes like borrito dough varient and the whole crepe just tasted bland in general with fruits. So go here for coffee skip the food!< /text>

<Review>This park is honestly a soccer park! The field has synthetic grass which is nice beacuse that means the kids won't trip on small patches of grass or holes made by the preious match. There are benches for the parents to sit and watch the games. There is a small playground area for the little ones and it has a fence around it so the kids won't run into the main road. Last but not least the bathrooms, they are clean and well maintained! The sinks actually have running water. To me that's a big deal because I have been to different parks and the bathrooms are gross! Check it out next time you are around there, this little park is a hidden little gem.</Review><GmapID>0x80dc7695ce3f0cc9:0xbb4d03cac54286d2< /GmapID></record>

<Rate>4<//Rate><Text>You like soccer and a pretty good playground  and a not bad play around basketball court then you'll like this park, yes it's not in the nices area and there is a friendly neighborhood sheriff stop spot next door, but the area has improved a lot over the years, 15 years ago I wouldn't have brought my kids there but, now i would. There's almost always a ice cream truck set up shop next to it and there's lot's of garage sells on the weekends all around it as well. It's not the kind of Park you want to have a picnic at but if you just want to run your kids around for half hour it's not a bad park.</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

Compared to forest in northern California and east coast, there are much less trees. But in southern California, it's still a good choice. In Indian area, there are some big trees, especially pines. Besides, it's a good place to overlook LA downtown and Pasadena downtown. Many people come here to enjoy the sunset.</review></record>

< Review>
Should be a good place if everything works. But even the restroom is closed and it asked us to use the one in Switzer fall. The parking is only for 15 mins. I don’t really know what the purpose is to have this place... at least, open the restroom ~</Review>

Stopped up here when one of my friends had an oil leak on his motorcycle. The water fountain works luckily, but the office itself is closed Saturday and Sunday. Considering there is no cell service on the mountain, there is a land line at the fire station across the street. One of the few places you can make a call from on the crest. Hung out here for about an hour. Beautiful views.</Review>

This is the information station here at the Highway 2 National Forest entrance. At this location you can purchase Daily access passes as well as annual passes. they also have lots of information about the National Forest, with trails, tours, and guides to help you navigate your way through the forest. They also have schedules and updates pertaining specific locations within the forest that close in summer and winter times. be sure to always stop by here to get the latest information about the forest. Also, it is your responsibility to protect the forest from a fire, so be safe!< /Text>

It's a great little spot to get info you need. You can also look at a map there and buy parking permits (that are needed to park in Fee Areas of the Forest). Staff is extremely knowledgeable.  Only open on weekends.< /text>

One of my favorite spots in LA.  I ride my bike near here a lot and stop for a rest and to fill my water bottle.  The vault toilet has been closed a lot lately due to a bee infestation - there's another one right up the road at the picnic area.<//Review>

If you have questions regarding sites in the Angeles Forest or just general do's and don'ts, this is the place you want to visit.

The park ranger was super funny. I had two buns on my head and she got excited and called me a bear. But besides her charm, she was super informative explaining how we couldn't go out in the forest and fire our legal firearms unless we had hunting permits. Online if you look at the information it appears to suggest you can go out to the forest and practice open firing as long as you are away from campers. But she explained how they aren't a open carry Forest. City folk don't know these things.

Overall great information.< /Review>

Ride up through Angeles Forest all the time. Had a mechanical failure on my motorcycle while on Angeles Forest Highway. Staff let us call AAA for a tow (there is no cellular service up here) and had a set of hex wrenches that we were able to borrow.

Latrine is available on-site.<//Text>

Walked in store get info on treadmills, Rob Higgins the sales rep, was very helpful & knowledgeable, he took his time & assisted me with the different brands and models. I let him know what my needs & training were and he matched me with the Horizon 7.8 AT.  Very smooth transaction, no sales pressure at all! I will definitely return!< /Text>

<Pics>None< /Pics><review>Purchased a Life Fitness Club Series + Upright bicycle. They were great! Personal service, very knowledgeable, friendly and guided me to the right bike based on my needs. Had availability earlier than most other vendors. Bike came in on time and was delivered promptly. They set it up in my home, safely, and quickly.
Rode the bike immediately and it was awesome! Better than the one at my fancy gym which I’m no longer a member of.
Fantastic experience</review>< rate>

<review>This review is long over due! The team that this place has helped me build my home gym over the course of 3 years! I am grateful because they were knowledgeable and the guys that came to install were excellent. My home gummy is complete and I am so happy because the gyms are closed due to Covid and all my family members come to my house to workout!< /review>< user>

<text>We bought an exercise machine from them. After a couple months, the machine is broken. We emailed them a few times no response. We called them. Only answer machine takes your call. There is no customer service. We prefer to purchase in local store to promote their business but lack of service would turn customers away.</text></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Exemplary customer service by Richard, the owner and Rob, the sales professional. Highly recommend them for any fitness equipment purchase. Was looking to buy a treadmill to get some exercise during this lockdown period. Both Richard and Rob patiently explained the various options that would fit in my budget range. Ordered a new machine that was promptly delivered but had an issue due to which had to return it. Then they worked with me to get an alternative solution again within my budget. Went above and beyond by reaching out to the fitness equipment manufacturer directly to get me the modelnof my choice, arranging for a shipment at the earliest possible and delivered it within a reasonable timeframe. Huge props to them for understanding the needs of the customer and doing whatever it takes! 5 stars indeed!!!!<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

Walked into zero greeting. Employee or Owner, stared straight at us and didn't bother to acknowledge us at all. We walked around the entire store and nothing. We just stopped in to shop for all new gym equipment for our new building location and even though we stood by the front desk waiting, we still weren't approached. Just ignored. Definitely not interested in giving business to this establishment.</review>

I bought a Vision S7100 suspension elliptical in Nov 2015.  Since it caused knee and back problems, I called Richard (the owner) and asked if he would pick it up and sell it on consignment.  When his guys picked up the unit I asked them for some paperwork to indicate that  I had given the unit to them.  They said it would be sent to me.  Five months later I still have not received any paperwork in spite of the fact that Richard has promised to send it at least 4 times.  He also says that the unit cannot be sold without repairs that he wants me to pay for!  The unit was working perfectly when I gave it to him.

Just received a call saying that the unit required a small repair which he did not charge me for and that the unit had sold.  I'll keep you posted re getting the check....

9/20 17  Just received the check for a very fair price.  Thank you Richard.<//Text>

<Text>Recently bought a treadmill from. All American Fitness. The owner, Richard , is extremely knowledgeable and spends the time to answer questions and give lots of info on the products. My Bladez 200T was delivered today and The 2 delivery guys,  Ruben and Israel, did an awesome job with set up and they cleaned up the boxes and  tested  the equipment and answered my questions.
I highly recommend doing business with this co.</Text>< Rating>

<rate>1<//rate><name>Gerard Barry<//name><Review>Don't support a business that continually litters the public sidewalk in front of their business after closing, at night and overnight. It's against the law, a public nuisance and safety hazard.

Look at the photos the owners uploaded of the inside of their store. Surely, there is space inside to store oversized boxes overnight if they for some reason can't dispose of them properly. What's the issue?< /Review>< pics>

Good food i just hate how they say they open at 11 but truly just open up when they feel like it. They suck at answering the phone too. I love their food forsure! But wish they open up at 11.</Review>

For starters it's not horrible but It is on the salty side. The employees are very rude always have a very angry face, they are not welcoming your business. It's like its painful for them taking orders and charging you and then handing the food to you. After all of that I've still gone there but after today I just cant go anymore. We waited 45/50minutes for a chicken dinner to go. Had I not paid first I would have just left. And the times I have tried to phone in the order they put me on hold and then never come back.< /text>

I give five stars  for the great food and the owner,, but his older son or his grandson i dont know which it is,   but he's somewhat rude,, never, I mean never have he smiled or say welcome . When you're being served at any type  of food establishment you want to be greeted  by someone that's  approachable .< /Text>

<text>A classic SF spot. You can chill on a blanket, walk your dog, learn how to hoola-hoop. Whatever you want to do, you can do it in St. James Park. It's beautiful & big. The park leads to a bunch of other attraction in the city as well.
I'm not sure why exactly I dropped a star, I just felt like it was more a four star than a five star place. Still radical though.< /text>< Pics>

This is the emerald heart of San Francisco. On a nice day expect to see people playing tennis, picnicking, jogging, rowing across little Stow Lake, and horseback riding on broad paths. Take time to stop and smell the roses - no really, their gardens are beautiful. Walk, ride, roller skate through the park. Not into cycling or strolling? Don't pass up this experience take the free shuttle that is available on weekends and major holidays, with stops throughout the park.<//Text>

A cute little mini-park tucked along the side of the beautiful + historic Mt. Saint Mary University. Many big, shady trees + lots of pretty grass. Popular for dog walks. Many well-behaved dogs come here for off-leash play. Small garden in center. 1 working water fountain. Relatively safe area even after dark. Pretty neighborhood lends to a nice walk too. Street parking is almost always an available. Popular with students to study + stretch.  A few homeless folks do hang here now + then but I've never had any problems over the many years I've been coming here. No fenced dog area so watch them carefully.  No playground. No restrooms. No benches. Nearby mini-market 1 street away. A historical marker across street has interesting story of this place too. Worth a read. Please pick up your dog waste + trash, friends, so we can all enjoy.< /Text>

<Review>Early mornings are so much better if your dogs are not dog friendly. They can enjoy the park to themselves. But it gets a bit crowded after 1pm. Dogs are loose and cross to the side of the street and it can get a bit scary if cars are constantly driving by. It would be great if we can fence it up so as dog owners we can feel a bit more safe letting the dogs loose.< /Review>< Name>

i didn't go to ggp for more than a decade after my dad had a serious accident there when i was a kid. wow was i missing out! when i finally ventured back into ggp for a photo shoot i was amazed and what I'd been missing. now i go back regularly and find something completely different every time. it's pretty amazing that this piece of land is right here.<//review>

Park.  It is a huge treasure trove of experiences!  We've enjoyed the Botanical Garden, the Academy of Sciences, and the Conservatory of Flowers in the past few years.  Luckily, two out of three of those visits were on sunny, mild days.  Begone, fog!</Review><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None< /resp><Gmap_id>0x80c2c7e9100598f7:0x650b6c5bf3a976c0< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<review>Great park with something for everyone from flower gardens to hill top look outs to bodies of water, Japanese Tea garden, Botanical Garden, waterfalls, windmills and tulip garden, archery fields, dog walking enclosure, carousel, can't cover it all in one walk.  Don't miss the buffalo paddock with real buffalo grazing.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

<Rate>5<//Rate><text>Walked in (parking and entrance in the back), asked for a Voodoo DRAG, got it in the color I wanted along with 120ml of Choice Skrilla (blueberry Cereal) flavored juice at 6mg. It's not bad, but has absolutely zero cereal flavor with a really strong fake blueberry air freshener type flavor. Getting used to it, and all sales are final unless defective, so remember that when buying a brand or flavor you've never had before. Probably should have asked for a smaller size bottle 😅<//text>< Pictures>

I came here for the first time the other day. I was tagging along with my boyfriend, who was getting new batteries and a charger for a vape that his friend had given him. I didn't really know anything about vaping when i walked in, but I left with tons more knowledge about it and a vape of my own! Helen was so helpful and informative and made the whole visit overall a great experience. If you know next to nothing about vaping and are thinking of giving it a shot, this is the place to go! I look forward to my next visit there!</Review>

Everyone here is great. I don’t know how people have the nerve to complain about the employees, service, or ownership of this business. I always go in here and get treated like a king. The employees always work with me and my budget to get me the best products on hand. They’ve even gone out of there way to order products that I’ve requested. I have, and will continue to refer my friends to this establishment. Helen and Erick have been the most helpful in educating me on my mod and the wide variety of products that they have available for their customers. They are extremely friendly and always have a positive aditude. I’ve been a loyal customer for years and will continue to frequent this location for all my vapeing needs.</Text>

The owner is way cool and I can see why he married that lady. But damn is she RUDE. I wasn't even done explaining how the battery I'd bought a day earlier. When she already had reasons why it wasn't charging. Like she knew everything. Like I said she's gorgeous. But mean as hell</Review>

I was going to a vape show in bellflower and people there are totally rude, disrespectful, helpless. It made you regret going there.

However, here at this location “Casa de vape” you will experience the total opposite. Their very helpful and they really know about the vapes. Their shelves are fully stocked with many vape juices of many choices. They also carry many parts to replace your vape which is rare and hard to find at other vape shops. I feel good when you leave the shop due to their customer service and the help you received. I totally recommend everyone to this location.<//Review>

Awesome place, real people and great setting. These guys are very friendly, helpful, attentive and very knowledgeable. Will take the time to vater to your needs, and for only $10 you can get a year membership to try out the flavor you're thinking of getting. Totally worth it and then some. They also have deals for every day of the week. The experience doesn't get any better than this. Absolutely recomend a visit here.👍</Text>

< review>
Super rude employees there demanding a tip to explain how to change a coil.  I went in to the store and i asked if they could help change my coil and employee by the name of erick told me if he changed it for me then i better leave him a tip if not then he would not help me at all.  I was shocked that they demand people to leave them a tip to get help last time i checked a tip is optional.  Then he started to lecture me about how he hates when customers come in and act dumb and say they dont know how to change a coil after he has explained to them how to do it.  Sounds like some one is tired of thier job.  Maybe erick and the other employee there got mad because both of them where playing video games as i was walking in and they got bothered that they had to pause the game to help me out.  Erick also said to me if i did not like to leave a tip then to just go to another vape shop.  I was happy going in to the shop and i left feeling stressed out.  This is not how to treat a customer. Please save ur money and headaches and dont go there.  I will never go and spend my money there anymore super bad service they both need to be retrained or they will lose a lot of customers and money.  One stare service all day .</review>

< review>
I've been coming to this Vape Shop for a while now. I recently came from Las Vegas and I decided to get a new build along with my sister. They did an amazing job on the Hand Braided build. Came back in a week later to purchased my first Box Mod (Wismec Reuleaux RX200) and loved it! Also purchased 2 RDA's from there with absolutely no problems.

Thanks to Marvin for assisting me throughout this whole time, would definitely come back.</review>

Never answer the phone! Office hours listed are incorrect, they are open until 3:30 pm. They take a lunch sometime throughout the day and their lunch hours are not listed so you end up waiting. Thus far Denise is the only one who has been able to reach out to me in nearly a week and she was even able to set up an appointment for me</text>

Our agency has multiple programs helping people, families and seniors in Alameda County, so our office is open on Fridays, but not for the LiHEAP department as our staff concentrates on processing the hundred of applications we receive each week. Per our website, all LiHEAP applications msut be submitted through the mail. http://www.spectrumcs.org/energy-services/heap The only in-person appointments for the LiHEAP application are for those who have a  48-hour notice or have been shut-off services.

So it’s one thing for a restaurant to get an order wrong, it happens. It’s a completely different experience to order something, have the restaurant make the order wrong, and have to call back in to have them correct the order. Then have the employees at the restaurant treat a customer less than average when they come in to get the correct order.

We ordered a veggie stir fry with no meat. When we got home, the order not only had meat, but it had 3 different types of meat; shrimp, chicken and beef. That’s not a big deal, it happens. The issue was going back into the restaurant to have the same employee give a completely different attitude as if I did something wrong. I was just requesting what I paid for, but the lady at the front had a completely different tone and was talking to me like I was inconveniencing their day. They were the one who made the mistake, I just made an order an was giving them my business.

They won’t be getting my business anymore.< /Text>

The store owner is so awesome she was very inviting. I also got the Chowmein with meat combo (shrimp, beef, and chicken) also very delicious. Try the veggie egg rolls they are actually crunchy delicious! I normally never finish the egg rolls but this place got me hooked. The Thai tea with Bobba is also so delicious I REALLY recommend this hidden gem!!!< /review>< rating>

Plates dished from the kitchen is extremely slow. An average wait time is 20-25 minutes, but wait is worthwhile because the food has authentic flavors. The staff exuberant and extremely friendly. The ginger chicken with lemon grass is fabulous.<//Review>

< Review>
Second time ordering food with this restaurant. This time around, I decided to place an order online through Postmates. Spent $55 on the whole order. When I went to pickup the order, I noticed I ordered chicken porridge instead of chicken pho. My daughter does not eat porridge so I asked if the cashier can make the correct order for me. She said she will not be able to because the order has already been placed. What she should of done was make the request and I would of been happy to pay the difference for it. I will not be returning to this establishment for sure for their lack of following through to accommodate customer satisfaction. People make mistakes; clearly I did and they should understand that.</Review>

Had the Cambodian Beef Stew via UberEats.  It was delicious!  I moved out of the city and miss Cambodian food.< /review>

If you want eat good Pho, this is not the place. Owner is Cambodia not vietnamese. Foods not that good. The ratings 4.5 maybe from previous vietnamese owner before sold to Cambodia. I don't recommend.</text>

The boba drinks are good, too. The chicken wing sauces for the wings they have are really good. EVERYTHING IS DELISHIOUS!< /text>< pics>

<text>I go here everyday even when their closed at tuesdays. I love their pho , their rice and their thai tea. Its been a year that i come here not even single time i got dissatisfied . Their customer service is tremendous and excellent not like fast food restaurants with a fake smile. I call the owners of the restaurant Ma and Uncle they are very sweet people.</text>< user>

Great food at a reasonable price. I have yet to try something that I didn't like. While the food is delicious the lunch time turn around from the time you order to when it get to your table is quite long. Recommendations: Rice Porridge, Pho, Thai Tea, Young Coconut< /Text>

The food and price are great. The manager has to double check and ask me if I want “everything that comes in it”, insinuating that I might not know what comes with the combination pho. I have dined in over 20 times and it’s still a surprise  to her every single time I tell her I want it how it comes and don’t need to remove anything... sometimes she even giggles when I tell her I want it the way it is normally served. White guy problems lol.< /text>

<Review>I went to this place because it had 4.7 stars, it should have 5! I ordered my shrimp pho togo, and it was delicious, very fresh. There were only a handful of shrimp (maybe 7 or 8) they did have their tails, therefore , I removed all tails and cut each shrimp in half. My pho was very enjoyable, I will go again.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

<text>One of the best Starbucks experiences I have had, and I have had quite a few! I am not local, but was in town for a gymnastics meet and visiting family. Stopped by the GV & Francisco locations before our 6 hour trek home and everyone was so friendly and welcoming! Great team who really cares about their customers. Kate spent the time while making our coffees asking me about our plans for the day, my family and after mentioning gymnastics, asked how our daughter did at her meet. You could tell she was really interested. Thanks for making us feel so welcome!!</text>< GmapID>

<rating>3< /rating><Text>I love Starbucks, but Safeway off of Green Valley Rd needs their hours to be adjusted both on Google and on starbucks.com. The other day I was in dire need of coffee (which doesn't happen that often) and it was evening so the most close by locations were closed. Finally I was excited to learn that this particular location was open until  7:30 pm. I rushed in and was there at 7:10 pm getting even more excited in anticipation of that very needed coffee. Well, I was quite upset when barista told me that they stop serving at 7:00. Please change the hours to 7:00 pm to reflect that, I wouldn't even bother going there if I knew. Thank you.</Text>< Pics>

Great cafe with extremely friendly and attentive baristas! Deanna and Natalie were welcoming from the first moment I walked in the store. Excellent, quick service and also a great conversation. They definitely provided the Starbucks experience. Thank you!<//Text>

Here around 3.10pm, crowded and tons of kids hanging around. Pretty busy and lively.  If you like people interaction then this is the place to come hang out. Drinks come out pretty fast and the scenery is nice.< /Review>

This Starbucks has a great outdoor seating area with great views of trees. You'll often meet people from the local neighborhood who have walked their dogs to grab coffee. A very pleasant place to visit.</Review>

The Baristas have been so personable and friendly! That is first and foremost the best part of my experience there. I often order using my Starbucks app so if I'm on the go I can trot inside to grab my order quickly. Early in the morning before the sun comes up I'm still greeted with a friendly smile and they ask me if my drink is made correctly. Yes! Every. Time. The environment is clean and bright.< /text>

They never get the order right and don't know how to frappicino without mix so nothing is ever sugar free. I will stick with Dutch Bros</Review>

Horrible service and incredibly rude staff. Nothing but glares and eyerolls from the man who took our order and treated my younger sister very rudely. She is on the spectrum so getting her to order is very important and he glared and did not even acknowledge her. I wouldn't care if it was directed towards me but the contempt that he looked at her with was very unprofessional. Hate to see that this is the service they deem okay.< /Text>

Definitely Five Stars based on the staff with excellent service, courtesy and knowledge, plus the great outdoors seating. However​, I gave three because corporate has really wrecked what was a great environment inside with a total gutting of the seating inside. My understanding is the manager has been upset about this but too professional to complain to customers. Two large tables that could seat either several individuals or a larger group of locals were taken out. Other seating that made this a community favorite was removed. And 15-20 stools were added at new, shallow counters placed against the windows. Corporate can still claim the store has the same or greater number of seats but they are not suitable for conversation or anything but looking outside or burying one's nose in a book or laptop. And, the stools are so close together that most can't be used, unless Starbucks is going to convert this area into a call center.<//Text>

<text>I have been coming to this Starbuck's since it opened.I used to go all the time when Diana & Terri were the managers. They were great managers & were always pleasant to the customers. I have noticed many changes since then & not for the good. The workers now are not very friendly & don't go out of their way to help. It is extremely slow & lacking good workers, & never has enough help especially on the weekends.
I went to Starbuck's this morning & ordered a Venti coffee to the top with no cream. I no longer got my coffee, & Andrea, one of the workers, presided to tell me I couldn't order coffee this way. She then started to lecture me in front of  people waiting in line. I was taken by surprise & felt like a little kid being corrected by a parent. I have been going to Starbuck's for over 20 years & the staff has never treated me like this. Lighten up Andrea!!  You should act in a professional manner & not like a whiny employee.</text><user_id>113488036337919201429<//user_id>< GmapID>

<response>None< /response><Text>First of all, thank you for the reasonable prices. When I saw the prices I didn't expect to get this kind of taste. But it was ridiculously tasty. I guess it is a family owned business, so do not expect to get a fancy restaurant service. Specially, because of the pandemic, staff number is limited for sure and it is not that easy to handle that huge place. So be patient. They were all friendly. We waited 20-25 minutes for 4 pupusas. But totally worth to wait. It was so fresh and hot that we had to wait for 10 minutes after got back to home to let it cool down a bit. The salad was super fresh. Highly recommended 👌< /Text>< user>

<review>Food I’d rate 5 star, service 4 on a bad day it’s a very popular local spot and for good reasons only issue I had was today with a delivery order I gave my info but somehow there was a miscommunication with my cell number, food was delivered but I received no call and was put on ban list. I end up going to the store and the thankfully everything was handled and taken care of professionally by the manager for the second half of the day. So pretty much lesson I learned from the second manager make sure to have your info clarified before you end your call. But yeah I still love this place and don’t mind the wait it’s really worth the wait for authentic food like this</review></record></dataset><record>

<Text>It's hard to beat their quality food is amazing. Service is very lacking. Otherwise it would be a 5 star easy.<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><Gmap_id>0x80c34c8dade8b9e3:0xa67868dc6b6a55ba< /Gmap_id></record>

I went today and ask for a chicken soup, it was ridiculous the way this lady served the soup in a little but very little disposable container that the soup fell on the plate that held it. I ask the server this is the way you guys serves the soup? She answered back if you wanted it bigger one you need it to ask for a bigger one when she not even ask me what size do I want it. I didn’t know you have to ask for a bigger size I said. But what really got me is that she not even try to fix the situation, it was take it or leave. I am not planning to ever come back to that place. Very bad service. Food was ok not even delicious.<//text>

<Rating>4<//Rating><text>Food is fire! Service is not very good. Dude in front ringing you up is kinda rude, could just be his attitude. I don't know but when I went I waited over 10 min before the other guy in the back came to ring me up. Mind you this was a pick up order, the first guy could've just rung me up and gave me my food. The food is good though so I knocked it down to 4 stars because of service.< /text></record>

I have compared the pupusas from other restaurants around and by far the size and flavor is the best. They’re always courteous and friendly. A couple of weeks back I placed an order for pickup and when I got home some items were missing. The best part is when I called they admitted their mistake and they sent one of their employees to deliver the missing items to the front of my door. That’s what I call great customer service! I didn’t have to write this review, but I did it anyways so other businesses can learn from this mom and pop restaurant. I highly recommend it.< /Review></record>

<text>I used to love the Pupusas from here until they changed the recipes. The black beans give them a new different flavor and I feel that they are a little dry
The old recipe with the pinto beans is much better</text><response>None</response><user_id>112551885057463280529<//user_id></record></dataset><record>

Delicious food everything was perfect. I had read other reviews saying that it was a long wait and yes this is not a fast food restaurant. They take a bit but you can literally hear them patting the masa for the pupusas. If you have an hour to eat definitely come in and enjoy a fresh pupusa (or 2) like me you can also order on the phone. The staff were really nice and friendly, they make you feel as if you were at a friends house.</review>

I went in to pick up tamales, and stayed for lunch! What a great idea! I had the taco/enchilada plate. It was fabulous! I visit this restaurant about once a month. The food is always fresh and hot. The staff are very friendly. The store is clean and well-kept. Whenever our nieces or nephews are in town, they always ask for tamales! My favorite is the chile and cheese; a close second is the beef.<//text>

When I got home my order was all wrong did not get what I asked for and the soup was by far the worse thing I have tried . Soup looked like dirty water litterly,  the so called vegetables the soup Carrie's where all bad and old , not only that on top of that they just threw in a bone with no meat in it wrapped up in foil . This is the second time they do this and first time I complained we went back they gave us better food , this second time they got offended and insulted my mother who was making the complained . I dont think it's fair or ok to serve this kids of food if we are paying customers who expect good food and service . We are not asking for money back but for them to pay attention.  To think if that was them who got what we got wouldent they be upset ? . What I disapointment and to think my best friend recomended this restaurant .<//Text>< Pics>

Delicious Pupusas. I am reviewing on my experience years ago. But this place is probably the only one in Fontana that actually has the best tasting ones.<//Review>

The price for 6 revuelta puppusas was unbelievable!!! It's so cheap and I asked for extra curtido !! And the staff are so friendly they make you feel welcome when you walk in. The puppusas taste is ok.I've had many many puppusas and honestly I can't really say their amazing they're okay, I'm Salvadorian and Italian so I'm in love with puppusas and I cannot vouch for the puppusas.< /text>

I love Pupusas and this is one of the best Pupuserias I've been to. They are very curtious. This is not a fast food joint so if you order to go be prepared to wait 20-30 min for your order.< /review>

Great food, Great Service and Friendly staff! Love the vibe in there... beach themed. The music was in English and Spanish. They played some Juan Gabriel and Bob Marley. A little of everything for everyone which I loved. Please be patient the food is made to order! I highly recommend!</Review>

Our first time here ordered 15 mixed and 5 cheese thinking they were gonna be small or average size.... I was wrong they are big! I ordered 4 for myself... Only ate 2 and they are delicious 😋 everyone got full and enjoyed them. I will recommend this place.<//text>

Okay, I know you think you know what a pupusa is, but baby, you've never had these. The dough is amazing and they are H U G E, the cheese is melty and crispy on the edges, and the horchata is made with toasted rice.

Run, don't walk to the party at Los Molcajetes!</review>

I found this place by accident, and I am so glad I did. The restaurant is very clean inside, and the staff are happy and treat you with the best of respect.
The food tastes home made, is absolutely delicious, and the prices are very good!
This is the place to go for a quick bite, or large dinner! You really have to experience this place to understand how awesome it is!< /text><Gmap_id>0x80c34c8dade8b9e3:0xa67868dc6b6a55ba<//Gmap_id>< userid>

For Christmas they had the nerve to sell frozen tamales when I place my order and I ask if their tamales were fresh!
When I got there they were about to give me FROZEN TAMALES!  They are lucky I did not hit them with them!
You must be out of your mind to want to serve customer FROZEN TAMALES!
The cashiers were disrespected and were making fun of me because I wanted FRESH tamales!
You better watch out when you are eating here, some of the items you will be getting are NOT fresh!
Like the tamales, and other items. It's a shame, because I used to eat there a lot, until they had the nerve to sell FROZEN items. If I wanted FROZEN items, I would go to Costco! A restaurant It's supposed to sell FRESH ITEMS!
They are lucky I didn't call the Health Department on their assess!
It's never too late!</review>

< Review>
I feel their customer service could be better. I had to wait 45 minutes for my avocado and tortillas to be served only for my food to arrive then and there as well. Not giving me time to eat my appetizer which happens to cost 7.00 by the way. I ordered a tamale which had a weird smell to it that i was able to taste as well. Did not like it at all and the service was not great Will not be returning<//Review>

They are very clean and friendly.  Their pupusas that we ordered to go were big and with lots of cheese.  And they are fast.  And it's not packed with people.  Which I'm surprised cause their food is delicious.  I will definitely come back again.</Review>

This is my first choice when I'm looking for some authentic pupusas. The size of each pupusa is pretty big but They also have and extra large size which can probably feed 2 people. But none the less very tasty. They also have a great selection of various Salvadoran dishes to choose from as well.< /text>

It was my first time visiting on my aunt request and recommendation and I fell in love with this place. It may look simple but it's cozy. People there are nice and always hard at work. I have never been to a restaurant where the servants are very active. You can hear how busy they are in the kitchen. The waitress was very polite always with a smile and very attentive. The food there was delicious . A real treat. I recommend this place<//Text>

This place is one of my favorites, clean friendly restaurant, with lots of food to choose from, very large portion plates and their food is yummy👌🏻and affordable, they always have music playing in the back ground, the only reason why I give them 4* is because I feel they could make the inside of the restaurant look nicer. Also I feel they take too long to bring the food to the table.
They have an “A” grade from the health department that’s a plus.😊<//text>

the food was okay at this place. Though yet it was very busy. From pupusas típico centroamericano that is served To order. seating is limited and the place is a little dark for my liking. Next time I go I will sit by the windows. Parking is limited to the street and to the back.</review>

Amazing atmosphere! Friendly and family environment! It is a family owned place to which is interesting fact. Coming from the Bay Area where there is a lot of Salvadoran food, this place in Fontana is the best! Recommend it for all meals of the day.<//review>

<text>So today my wife picked up an order and there were some food items missing once I got home. I called and asked what’s the best solution for this issue. I live in Colton so the restaurant is a bit far. I don’t mind making the drive to pick up some delicious Salvadorian food, but it’s about the customers. They’re staff took my order and said they’ll deliver it. Their delivery person arrived to my home and took care of the order professionally. I love this place, I go there with my family every so often I’m glad to see they took care of this issue actually thinking about the customer. Thank you for handling this in such a great way.< /text>< Pics>

Been coming here for years. Best pupusas out of anywhere I've been to. And ive been to alot.  They're always good. Never a bad pupusa. Even the drinks are amazing. I love their ensalada drink. It's awesome. Also try their empanada.

Yes the wait to get them can be long. But that's because they're made from scratch. And they're perfect and you can't rush perfection. So what I do Is I call ahead a good 30 minutes. And even then the wait can still be another 15 to 20 minutes. But like I said. You can't rush perfection.

Like 80%of the time the service is great. The other 20% it's not. Depends on whos working I guess. But it doesn't bother me. I'll take bad service as long as the food is amazing. Meh but that's just me.

I tell everyone i know about this place. Because I think it's that great.< /review>

Food is awesome,service is scrappy. Waitress will not come back when your food is served. We had to stand up and find them when we needed a refill/containers/the check.
But food is delicious.</review>

You know what they say "Where there's one there are a hundred more where that come from" Just saying.. . Also the customer service was terrible! I did dine in this time and maybe that's why I saw this lil guy. I normally take it home.  Never eat the at the restaurant.  Well, now we are not eating there anymore.  Also prices are on the pricey side now! Beware...<//review></record></dataset><record>

All the cheese was out on just one side. Pupusas were "fritas" like she put so much oil on the plancha,  in which pupusas aren't even supposed to have oil. The bean in my pupusa was salty. Oh and the horchata, gross, tasted like pure spice like clavo. My daughters didn't like any of the food and they are big fans of pupusas, but this was terrible. That pupusera has been there since the beginningin which lets me to believe she's related to the owner, she needs to learn to make them. This was so gross! The only good thing was the agua de arrayan and that is just terrible being that it's a salvi restaurant.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

The food is amazing.. service is a bit slow but anywhere I’ve been to buy pupusas has taken forever so if you want pupusas you’re gonna have to Wait patiently . While you wait order some chips and the bean dip it’s sooooo good.</Text>

I waited a while to be seated they didn't even set me I requested to be seated at the table I wanted to seat then I got the menu 10 mins later and after I got menu 2 minslater they came to ask what I wanted. Get better waiters and get a nice staff. I'm disappointed!<//Text>

<Review>Extremely disappointed ☹️ My husband and I have been customers for seven years. After a couple of phone order that we place we always kept having issues with our order. Spoke to the owner we where given a credit to replace an item from a previous order that was not given to us but paid for two weeks ago. Called today to place an order and ask for the item that I had already paid for and was not given. I was told I can longer have it because I was suppose to pick it up within 7 days. I explained that information was not explained to me. He said well to bad I’m letting you know now. Honestly we have been customers for seven years I could not believe it. Over an order of rice you lost a customer that goes to your restaurant monthly and orders take out for a family of seven.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

I am not Salvadorian but I have been eating pupusas for many years from many places. I called in an order as I was driving home from work and was going to place my usual order when the person taking the order suggested I try the typical Salvadorian plate, which I had never had before. Well, let's just say that I found my new favorite dish and I'm grateful that's someone suggested for me to get out of my comfort zone and try something a little bit different because everything was so DELICIOUS and tasty.🤤 Augh, the chicharrones and the pupusas mixtas are to die for! Well, not literally, but you get my point. 😏</text>

The pupusas here are delicious, the best I've had in Fontana. This is a go to spot for the fam and I. The pupusas are also a very decent size, plus they deliver now. On weekends they also have an outside grill going on, the owners are great, and this is a family owned restaurant. A good appetizer is the Yuca and Chicharon, don't forget the put lemon on top 👌. For desert I recommend the plantains empanadas filled with custard, goes great with a coffee 😋.<//Review>

I dont recommend this place to any one unless you want to wait more than an hour to get your food, get the incorrect order or incorrect change. The first time I did an order over the phone and went about 30 minutes later and still waited for about an extra 20 minutes. The second time I picked up another order and was short 4 pupusas and when I went to go pick them i waited more than an hour just for that. The third and final time I got the incorrect change back and when I called them on it I was told that I was given the correct change and that I must have dropped my money and kept arguing about it with me. I dont recomend anybody to come to this place it's seriously a joke. It's so unorganized, every time you go in theres people waiting for their orders who just look irritated because they're having to wait for mediocre food. They just lost a customer for sure!<//review>

<username>carol h< /username><Review>Was real greasy. Gave us wrong order then wisked it away while I was eating it trying to find pork. It was bean and cheese. Brought out right order, I guess. It tasted like burnt tripe. I ate a piece. They charged me for two when I ordered one. Said I ate both. It was their fault. They never asked if they should take first one away. It was so loud couldn't hear waitress. Terrible experience.</Review>< date>

<review>Ill put it like this... It is so delicious that even though technically they close at 10pm...they're NEVER closed by that time because they allow people to order up 10pm... And they will totally let you stay and enjoy your food past 10 no problem. To the reviewer below named "Heather Ucles"... Good riddance👋. Enjoy your crappy pupusas from El Chalet 😂.  I think its run by 2 brothers.. They are great guys who make the customer feel very welcome. And the pupusas have meat and cheese all the way to the edge... Not like other pupuserias where theres only meat in the middle.< /review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

The food and service are good , I have tried other Salvadorean Restaurants, better food and better service and much much better prices than here.  Their prices are exorbitant.< /Review>

Bad service. While we were there another group came after us. They got their food first. Servers walked past our table and didn't say a thing. Will never go again unless they improve their service.</text>

That said, I'm always apprehensive about pupusas when eating out. My mom's pupusas will always be the best to me, but the pupusas here are well done.

I especially enjoy that they offer casamiento, which was delicious. The chorizo offered here was new to me, but was also very good, served on a sizzling skillet. The horchata was good and the authentic Central American stuff, which can be hard to find. It was definitely much sweeter than what I'm used to, so that is something to keep in mind.</Review>< pics>

<Rating>3< /Rating><Review>I was having a great time, enjoying the delicious food until I decided to question the $6.99 charge for guacamole and hand made chips that were offered and not ordered. Any other restaurant will offer you chips and salsa at no charge. They took the same approach but came with a fee in the end. Like I said I did not orderer it, it was offered, not only that but the guacamole and chips werent in the menu. The pony tailed "manager" came and said out loud "so you dont want to pay for the....." I had placed the money on the counter and was only waiting for an explanation. The "manager" asked if I ate the guacamole and therefore I would have to pay, he kept on talking not allowing me to speak my mind. He said Im the manager and Im here at your service. What service if he dont allow me to speak. As soon as he said the last word, he looked at me up and and down as if he wanted to meet me outside and kick my ass. What a looser.  He gains $7 today but looses a customer and he wont make any money from me again.....what a payoff. Excellent food just be aware of charges they add for whats not on the menu and is offered without mentioning the cost.</Review>< Pictures>

The food is good. it's good to dine in. But the service to order take out is bad. They got the order of Pupusas completely wrong, & they didn't give any "curtido" or salsa for the pupusas. We also ordered yuca con chicharron & they gave very little. That's the last time I'm coming here.</review>

This place has good food most of the time, but the staff sux, we called to place an order and asked about there grade because we had seen that thay had gotten a B a few months before,so I wanted to know if thay corrected the problem, the lady just got all offended and rude and hung up .. It was just a simple question no need to get all bent out of shape..then we call back and she said she was the owner, thats just grate...good food,bad service ,unknown grade ..<//Review>

Worst customer service. Waiting for 50 min for food to go. At least they should of tell people ahead of time before ordering how long is the food going to take.</Text>

No. Just no. They were rude and screwed my order up so bad. And their pupusas are subpar. Get a microwave burrito instead.<//Review>

<Review>(Translated by Google) What a bad service forgetful people did not put cutlery that I asked for, the corn atole did not arrive, nor did the sodas arrived very late. By the way, if you ask for large or regular pupils, I advise you to go the regular ones, the others bring more beans and scrambled eggs than cheese and only in the middle brings the preparation, the rest is pure Pupusa alone. I definitely prefer grinding

(Original)
Que mal servicio olvidadizos no pusieron cubiertos que les pedí no llegó el atole de elote ni las gasiosas llegaron muy tarde. A por cierto si preguntan pupilas grandes o regulares les aconsejo ir las regulares las otras traen más frijol y revuelto que queso y solo en medio trae el preparado lo demás es pura Pupusa sola. Sin duda prefiero la molienda</Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPyJMH5nfRuRMhODvizr7TywQY1wVCZLJQGAyQh=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP54UrTAx8_O9cerhBQz3PPyqKfyKeb61v5yi_V=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics><Response>None<//Response>< gmap_id>

Cuando ordene un café pensé que era café de la oya
Resulta que es un café que venden en cualquier establecimiento regular por un $1.00 o $1.50
Un café aquí cuesta $3.23 😱😱😱😱
Pero como?? Entiendo que todo está caro horita pero café con baso blanco mediano
Creo que no es precio está un poco elevado…< /Text>

<text>(Translated by Google) I had a beef soup and it was wonderful, the meat very soft, with yucca and handmade tortillas. It should be said that the service and attention was excellent. Mr. José who is the owner has a place worth becoming a franchise in many cities. Congratulations and up the entrepreneur Salvadorans.

Comí una sopa de res y estuvo de maravillas, la carne muy suave, con yuca y tortillas hechas a mano. Cabe decir que el servicio y la atención fue excelente.

<review>(Translated by Google) I just made a beef suspon that I was surprised, very good soup 😋. And it's not because I could eat a dinosaur, it's just that it's delicious, with its cheese and two freshly made tortillas, also the colachampan that did not lack.

(Translated by Google) I bought 5 revolts to take and when I got home, when I opened the container, I got them very burned that they didn't even shame when they gave them to me, the tubes that I dumped because they were bitter because they were burned, that's an abuse to the client because we trust your service.

(Original)
Compre 5 revueltas para llevar y al llegar a casa, al abrir el contenedor, me las dieron muy quemadas que ni verguenza tubieron al darmelas asi, las tube que tirar por amargas que estaban con lo quemadas, eso es un abuso al cliente porque confiamos en su servicio.< /Review>

(Translated by Google) After my bad experience in another restaurant I found this one in google the owner or manager is very friendly the place is clean the waiters are friendly if the popusas take a while to come out but it's worth the wait they are delicious and they are not expensive if I would like them to They will give more sauce and what you put in the popusa and salt shaker but I highly recommend it

(Original)
despues de mi mala experiencia en otro restaurante encontre este otro en google el dueño o manager muy amable el lugar es limpio los meseros amables si se tardan un poco en salir las popusas pero vale la pena esperar estan riquisimas y no estan caras si me gustaria que dieran mas salsa y lo que se pones en la popusa a y salero pero muy bien lo recomiendo</text>

(Translated by Google) I do not know what happened to this place was my favorite but it seems that the more they grow, the less love they put the beans first, they are almost whole in the pupusas, hard hard beans and they don't even grind them well, that disgusts me, the beans are not even fried And the chicharron that comes in the yucca tastes like fish, it is horrible, it is delicious, so to finish it occurs to me to ask for bean empanadas, aaaaaa horrible oil where they fry the chicharron, it seems that it is the same where they fry the bananas and then there if I could see the beans Whole and horrible I hope you read my comment I am not someone who visits you only one day I am a 5 year old client and I really do not know what happens to you but I hope you take it into account and improve

The dirty tables, you ask for coffee refill and that is not there either. I will not go again and recommend less.

(Original)
Hoy fui ....y la atención super mal , como puedes vender pupusas si no tenes curtido ¡¡¡Hello!!!!  Los tamales de elote quemados la mesera que tiene un tatuaje parece como que si ala fuerza te atendía.
Las mesas sucias ,le pedís refill de café y que no hay tampoco. No vuelvo a ir y recomendar menos.< /review>

(Translated by Google) The customer service is "EXCELLENT" the pupusas more or less but the bread with chicken was delicious and the same as the fresh fruit, the empanadas delicious, the nachos or better said fried omelette very good something different I think the menu is very short and a little expensive but everything almost tastes the truth I recommend it.

(Original)
La atencion al cliente es "EXCELENTE" las pupusas mas o menos pero el pan con pollo estaba rico e igual el fresco de frutas, las empanadas riquisimas, los nachos o mejor dicho tortilla frita buenisimo algo diferente pienso que el menu es muy corto y un poquito caro pero todo casi tiene sabor la verdad lo recomiendo.< /review>

(Translated by Google) It is undoubtedly the best Salvadoran restaurant they use the same ingredients that they use in El Salvador and that makes them more authentic and original
I highly recommend them and I assure you that they will return and they will return because those who are Salvadorans like me will fully identify with the typical food there and those who try it will surely want to return attended by excellent plateaus one of them is Rosa

(Original)
Indudablemente es el mejor restaurante Salvadoreño usan los mismos ingredientes  que usan en El Salvador y eso los hace más auténticos y originales
Se los recomiendo ampliamente y les aseguro que regresarán y regresarán porque los que son salvadoreños al igual que yo se identificarán plenamente con la comida típica de allá y los que la prueben querrán con toda seguridad regresar atendidos por excelentes mesetas una de ellas es Rosa< /text>
