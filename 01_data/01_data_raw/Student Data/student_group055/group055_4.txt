I miss togo's! Was great and friendly service, even got an unexpected treat for my service dog.  Such a great little snack/meal near campus. Got a roast beef decked out and it was as good as I remember.</review>

Took the knife skills class this evening with my partner, and we both agreed we learned much easier, safer ways to handle our knives and prepare anything that needs to be sliced, diced, or chopped. Chef Olive was engaging, entertaining, and informative and we couldn't help but want to take another class soon.< /text>

Mayra and Ivan showed up at my brother's life celebration even earlier than they promised, were super kind and respectful, set up and began food service right on time. The food was absolutely delicious and they kept cooking into the night even when it got dark in the backyard and we used phones to illuminate the food.</review>

The store also includes many different Italian grocery items so it's great to shop/look around while waiting for your sandwich.  I even found my new store for lady fingers to make tiramisu.</text>

I love love love love love Toto sandwiches are delicious you have got to try their Asian salad delicious. And if you like you can request that you condiments be placed in small little containers will you can put it on later if you wanted for lunch at work or you may want to take it home and eat it but you don't want your bread soggy before you get home. They are very accommodating I just love getting my sandwiches in my salads from there in the soup is not bad either</text>

<review>Food here never disappoints. The wait for the food is a bit long during lunch time but it is still worth it because the portion of the food is perfect size and the price is not bad for the size of it. Typically during the school year there will be more people because of the high schoolers but definitely worth trying the Lickin' and the Fishin'<//review><date>1591701512555<//date><GmapID>0x80c2c7fbb344db45:0x6c2fe16f92f7d1ad</GmapID><username>Elizbeth Smith</username>< rate>

<Review>The employee girl was sweaty and rude. The took sooo long to prepare the sandwich cause she was messing around on her phone.  Worse of all, the sandwich was greasy.  So greasy the box it was set in was soggy.  The pretzel bun was so soggy with oil and grease my fingers went right through it. I was hungry and spent 9 dollars for a sandwich I had to throw away. Shame on you Togo's.<//Review></record>

< review>
I’ve been to this location a few times. I always get the pick two with a tuna sandwich and a Sante fe chicken salad and substitute the chicken for tuna for FREE (I’m a pescatarian).  This time the man charged me for the substitution and charged me for two pieces of cheese when I only got one. I’ve never been charged for a meat substitution. He charged for a scoop of tuna. He must of been having a bad day because he was irritated, so I tried not to complain. I was very disappointed with the service I received. And the avocados was sour 😞<//review>

I have Banfield wellness plans for three (3) dogs. I generally have had good experiences with Banfield, but we recently moved to the area and needed some single dose heartworm medicine for two of our dogs. I ordered the single dose medications from an online pet prescription company who mistakenly sent the fax (and follow up faxes) to the Clayton office. The Clayton office sat on faxes for several days, before calling me to let me know it should go to the Willow Pass Road Banfield (where my dogs had their recent exams). I asked if they could just forward it to them, but Willow Pass Road  Banfield was closed for several days due to staffing issues. Dr. Karen Tancuan would not sign off on the heartworm medicine without my dogs having appointments.

What is the point of being with Banfield where I can supposedly get pet care at several locations and they all have access to the pets' medical records. A complaint will be filed with the VMB.</text>

<Text>The vets here have always been great with my dog and two cats. My pets are remembered by name and cared for like family. I'm lived in several states and been to many vets with my cats and I've had the best and most personal experience at this particular Banfield. I would definitely recommend!</Text>< pics>

My son, Mark Wong, and I brought our  beloved dog, Kingsley, to Banfield Veterinary hospital as he was in liver failure. The Veterinarian and her staff were very kind, compassionate, and caring. They helped us make the right decision to euthanize our dog who was clearly suffering.<//Review>

< review>
Receptionist was Unhelpful and extremely rude!By appointment only. If you dont have an appointment and your cat has a foxtail stuck in its eye (which is what we had) or something else that is similar go to SAGE or ANY OTHER VET instead. The receptionist didnt even care or try to make an appointment for us or even try to see if the Dr could see us. She was TERRIBLE</review>

<Review>Who knew that a coconut iced coffee would be so magically combined that every sip felt like heaven? Plus, the avocado toast had flavor in every bite. The bread was also pretty good, and seeing how this coffee shop is attached to a cake shop, it really goes above and beyond with the baked goods. Will be coming back 💯</Review>< Pics>

<Date>1615760767459<//Date><review>We constantly seek out small, independently owned coffee shops. This one was one of the best. We tried four different coffees, all of which were delicious (to me at least). A word of caution, don't expect the mint cold brew, made with muddled mint leaves to taste like "peppermint." It is mint but carries a different flavor. If you appreciate different flavors, you'll enjoy this as well.</review>< Gmap_id>

< Review>
Loyal client here, I bring family and friends all the time. Was there this morning ordering toasts and cupcakes for my kids. 20 minutes of waiting when I finally decided to check the status of my order. To find out they lost my receipt. After 30 minutes  of waiting in the cold and a very insincere “sorry”. Super discouraged at how the situation was handled, I’ll definitely think twice before returning anytime soon.

Revised review-
The owner reached out to compensate for the inconvenience. I appreciate the gesture. Stars were changed.<//Review>

I really loved the kind of options they had in their menu. They have many interesting lattes and mochas and kids options too to choose from. The banana chocolate mocha and the mazapan latte are really good. The staff is super friendly and patient.</review>

I am a huge fan of Mexican Mochas, so of course when I saw it on the menu it was a must try. We ordered the hot and the iced. We were not disappointed!! I also ordered the enormous cinnamon roll and elote toast. Yes, elote toast. It had my taste buds going wild! It is very well seasoned with delicious guacamole, toasted elote, tapatio chile on a slice of thick Texas toast. Buy it and Try it.<//text>

<Review>Best coffee in San Lorenzo/San Leandro/Hayward area.  Friendly staff and some really great coffee drinks that might sound like they pound you with sweetness but manage not to.  If you want the sweet, then you're in luck.  Brewja shares space with Gala Bakery, which is one of the best bakeries in the area.  Cupcakes are a sweet sight to see.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

I really wanted to like this place but I very much didn't and was surprised. I ordered the cafe con leche and it was lukewarm and tasted watery. I got lemonade for my son and he said it was the weirdest lemonade he ever had. The frosting on my cupcake was hard and they didn't have any toast (only on weekends). Super disappointed.< /text>

I really wanted to like this place. I've been twice and each time my drink wasn't good. One time I think they didn't even add any peppermint.  They fill the cups to the tippy top and then you're expected to walk over to the lids without spilling and spend 5 minutes putting on a lid. My hubby and my hands shake so this is extremely difficult. His mexican mocha was good though. Starbucks is so much more convenient and tastes better. Frodo Joes is also a great small coffee business to support. I don't think I'll be back to  Brewja. I'd recommend the barista putting on the lids and more attention to detail with the orders. I really wanted to like this place! Darn.<//text>

I've never seen so many people trying to make sure that I felt comfortable in the store and the show me what was on sale what was the. Things that were out of stock in when's it going to come back in so I can go there and pick it up. I must say this particular visit the customer service was outstanding detailed and went  some extra time to make sure I understood everything I need to know about the material and what it would do after I bought it and when I tried it sew it. Thanks again for the confident that you showed me that I could do it and how to do it greatly appreciated.<//review>

There wasn't a big selection of baby yarn.  What there was there, most of the colors only had 1 - 2 skeins of yarn.< /review>

<text>In this town there are two places to get your craft supplies Jo-Ann's or hobby lobby. I prefer Jo-Ann's I think they have a better selection and their prices are better. There's absolutely nothing wrong with hobby lobby I just find them a little expensive. I think you'll enjoy the Joanne selection as well.< /text><pics>None<//pics>< date>

< Review>
I've had so many positive experiences at this joanns. There are so many people that always answer your questions. Marie helped me today and she is just the sweetest person ever. She took her time and answered all my questions. She was working and she stopped what she was doing to help me. Thank you Marie ♡<//Review>

<Text>Extremely rude on the phone called to figure out why my debit card was charged twice for one order in store. The women was extremely rude told me there is no returns in the store right now okay what ever but to be extremely rude about taking more money is not understandable. It's my money and I'm out of work cant afford to have my card charged twice and then not even have the items from the second charge so will never be going back to this store. Very shameful the women in the store dont know how to be nice at all even in the store you walk in and they all glare at you as if you shouldn't be in the store. Not welcoming AT ALL!

I don't understand why they sell all the supplies you need to cross stitch, but not any patterns, it's terrible. I don't know who decides this stuff but it doesn't seem to do any good to complain. Will go to Michaels or Hobby Lobby.<//review>

<Text>Worst customer service I’ve experienced at any retail store. The elderly self proclaimed supervisor has absolutely no people skills. Her lack of professionalism and rude demeanor are a horrible combination in the customer service industry. The younger “supervisor”  lacks training and has a long way to go before being ready for a leadership position.
I stood in line almost an hr after working 9 hr only to be disrespected and my reason for going not being addressed.. the elderly lady at the door letting people in, never once got up from the chair, didn’t give anyone any information and let  customers stand in line only to find out when they got to the front that they were not taking any returns. There are no signs and the Web site states “hazle free returns “with a Smile”.. That is a lie!!
I gave Joanns another shot and regretted my decision to do so. I will not be returning and have deleted the Joanns App.</Text>< Pictures>

<rating>5< /rating><review>Recently Joann fabrics moved from just east of downtown hemet to a new location on the west side of town.  What the reasons for the move are unclear. As the only full service cloth and sewers supply store within the city limits,  they hold the monopoly on the trade.
It may be to a general decline in overall sales as the days of mothers and daughters  sewing together are being replaced by lower cost garments available in the marketplace,  especially available online.
At one time,  women and some men,  relied on commercially available patterns to fabricate that specific piece of clothing that was not readily available in the local market.
Where the sewing machine was once a standard in every well kept home,  this device has been relegated into the hands of the occasional hobbyist.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None</response>< gmapID>

Amazing selection of beads, pendants, and charms. They were all half off at the time I went in with the goal to make a dreamcatcher for my girlfriend for our one year, but ended up hand assembling a necklace. Staff helped me find everything I needed, and didn't rush me.<//review>

This is NOT an essential business!! Close all your stores immediately & pay your staff to stay home. You could be killing people with your greed.< /text>

Came in as a walk-in and Blanca helped us right away! My son has been hurt before getting his hair cut so hes terrified of loosing an ear. She took great care of him and made him feel so comfortable. Stopping to show him what she was using which calmed him. He looks fantastic and was able to get a design. We will continue to go back to her and bring the men in the family. We are a Heinz 57 type family. All hair types are done here</text>

There are two Vietnamese women and one Mexican woman besides the black males.  And man can they all cut hair.  My favorite is Van.  You might want to make an appointment.  Great hair cutters.  By far my favorite shop.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

Went there a few years ago with my son on his first backpacking trip. This place is beautiful.We had a great time and enjoyed it . The down side is The place is  turning into Mammoth,  Highly trafficked., not many places to camp, and above the 10,000 foot "No Fire Zone". There are many beautiful places in the Sierra, check out Mammoth< /text>

Wow! Such a great hike. Parking area had a porta a potty. The road in is gravel, but was in good shape when I went in June. The trail to the lake is really beautiful. It starts out steep and hot, but then you get to the aspen groves next to the creek. There’s decent bird watching and views along the trail. The lake has a beautiful backdrop, more stunning than other mountain lakes I’ve hiked to.</Review>

<Review>This is an incredible hike that's quiet and off the beaten path... uphill at first,  but levels off. Hike takes about 45 mins in.  Absolutely gorgeous views! Parker Lake is stunning.</Review>< Pics>

<Text>Went there to enjoy the fall color, but it was past peak. If you want to see the golden aspens alongside the trail, your best bet should be before the first week of October.</Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOMImKV2WVR-4v2rWvcz0-pgdy9L9pbhbUTmGQV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOB5iGoG5L0uQOAC3G3Iei_iDBiWhW1jRIhheLl=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics><Response>None< /Response><gmapID>0x809641609878a65d:0xf6dc890b2d475d07<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Wow, wow, wow. This place is awesome. If you’re ever camping in the June Lake area, definitely make this a priority. Beautiful. Trails moderate but worth it.< /Review>

<review>Great hike! Initial mile is definitely the most challenging, then meandering along the creekside. Good views of Mono Lake on the way back down to the car.< /review>< GmapID>

Great hike! A bit more secluded so if you want a quieter hike this is the place to go to. It's a beginner hike with elevation gain mostly in the first mile. The one thing we forgot was bug spray which I regretted the next morning. (lots of mosquito bites).

We also took our dog on this hike since it was dog friendly.

The other issue is getting to this trail requires you to drive on some rough gravel road for at least 2 miles. Any car can make it, but it won't feel pleasant compared to an suv. We also saw a prius parked at the lot before the trail head as well.< /Text>

<text>The trail head is easily accessible by a small car, and has ample parking spots. Although it is about over a mile on the wide dirt road it is easy to make your way. Be adventurous if you are in a truck or jeep and take one of the many dirt roads on the way! The way to Parker lake is well marked.<//text>< pictures>

Trailhead is just a flat open dirt patch. The trail itself is better. About 2 miles in length it goes up alot for about the first mile (with minimal shade) then flattens out in a more shaded fashion. I think the lake is prettier than Convict which is regarded as the prettiest lake in the area.</text>

This is a beautiful hike, spectacular fall colors near the lake and great views on the way back. The road to the trail head is a little rocky.</Text>

<review>Bit of a drive on a washboard road to get here, but the trail is about two miles long and is a bit challenging at first, especially you have small children, but it is petty easy to manage once you level out.  The lake is beautiful and seems like it is very private since you need to hike in to reach it.  There is also a portapotty next to the trailhead< /review>< Resp>

Parker Lake (about 4.5 miles round trip)
Starting at the Parker Lake trailhead outside the small town of June, make your way up a slow incline in the sun. Look behind you (or just wait until your hike out) and see Mono Lake in the distance. The trail will peter out and leave you in the shaded company of a creek. After about two miles on the trail, you’ll make it to the lake. Look across to see the waterfalls. Early summer will bring wildflowers; mid-fall, yellowing aspens.

Though it is possible to make your way around the lake, a little bushwhacking will be necessary. If peace is what you’re seeking, don’t venture all the way around but instead make your way to a log for a rest or bring your fly rod and try for the occasional trout.< /review>

<Review>Everytime I come here they use the same canned techniques for higher monthly payments and initiation fees, disguised now as annual fees. Canceling membership is also a drawn out process.
The facilities are nice.< /Review>< name>

Nice gym. Great facility... more organization needed though... the equipment are well maintained and there are wide variety of machines for fitness and resistance training. A swimming pool is available along with a basketball field. Plenty of classes of yoga and zumba. A spinning room is available as well. The enrollment fees are affordable and acceptable. This place needs new equipment though. A lot of equipment are a bit old<//text>

<text>As a life long member of LA Fitness and as someone who has been to the various LA Fitnesses throughout San Gabriel Valley... LA Fitness Arcadia is exceptional place to work out in. Upon arriving the Front Desk Manager Francesca greets you with a warm smile and the health questionaire is easy to read and straight forward. The entire club is clean from top to bottom. The tread mills are clean and are safely spaced out to allow guests to use them and TVs are in excellent working condition. Downstairs the free weights and weight machines are in excellent working condition and the gym members are excited to be back as i am also. Equipment is clean and entire staff from Francesca to the other LA Fitness Employees are pro active in their walking around making sure we are all following Covid Guidelines. Dissapointed when LA Fitness closed last year but thrilled once again LA Fitness is open. Plenty of parking is available... great work to entire staff.</text>< Rating>

I have been trying to cancel my membership services because of the current situation. I have been emailing them constantly with no replies and calling them directly only to be given a short automated speech and nothing else. I absolutely do not recommend this money-hungry and unethical company to anybody because of all the restricting contracts that they require you to sign for anything and the money first approach that they have. Their only goal is to just make heaps of cash even at the expense of their clients' livelihoods. Also, I was charged today even though the gym hasn't even been open yet, and the nearest open gym is about two hours away.</Text>

<name>Eric C< /name><text>I've used this branch of LA Fitness for years and am generally satisfied. This review is specifically for the recent reopening in the COVID environment. Firstly, in my opinion, gyms are inherently high risk places for respiratory illnesses of all types as multiple people are touching, coughing and sneezing on equipment. I was shocked to see that although the gym has tried to keep people 6 feet apart, there are NO additional dispensers of sanitizers or wipes. In fact, this morning at 7am, ALL of the dispensers of alcohol based disinfectants were empty. I'd consider bringing your own if you frequent this gym.< /text>< Time>

<Text>This is the only LA fitness in my area that doesn't have those awful octagonal plates. The other gym goers here are generally more courteous than the one on Rosemead and Foothill, and the staff members are nice. However, the men's bathrooms haven't been well-serviced on occasion—especially in the early morning.< /Text>< pictures>

<Review>The help I received when my stuff is stolen from my locker is unbelievable, The salesperson who is a Chinese guy wearing glasses doesn't even bother to provide any sort of assistance and have zero knowledge on how to. The women at the front desk doesn't bother to help because she is leaving, not a single report was filed on that day. It made me felt like they are helping who ever is stealing stuff in the locker to not get caught. The salesperson is the kind of guy who neglect the customer once they signed up for membership. Honestly, I'm not asking them to get my stuff back or catch the person who is stealing stuff, but the kind of attitude I got while I tried to solve my problem is insanely awful. Never have I ever encounter people with this such of attitude. DON'T BRING ANYTHING VALUABLE, because with attitude like this, this gym will be a easy target for the thief. If your stuff is stolen don't expect them to provide any assistance.< /Review>< Pictures>

A lot of equipment and interior recently remodeled. Running machines are kind of too simple (dashboard); swimming pool is old and does not show transparency even it is just replaced due to the poor tiles color (faded). Everything else are good, front desk and service people are nice, also dedicated cleaning person hired; recommended.
I've been in LA Fitness in foothill, Pasadena, Monterrey Park, did not have fun and back to this one again.< /text>

<user_name>lina liu< /user_name><time>1518287654872< /time><rating>1</rating><Review>I will never go back! Arcadia LA Fitness is junk! I received several hundred dollars entrance fee, said no matter what time I can leave, I don't accept any fees in leave period, the most senior members pay a monthly fee back to what time, but when I said to leave a month, they said to leave a month, this month to collect tens of dollars! I wonder how to say when the card is not the same, if so why do I have to pay a few hundred dollars entrance fee? A woman is with me at the same time the card, her membership fee is half of my monthly fee, but also cheaper than me, enjoy the treatment is the same! To talk to manager, he said there were more than 50 dollars a month for someone to pay. I say you are really cheated. It's very chipping! He said he can promise I don't pay a monthly fee in the absence! I'm still upset. Do you guarantee my use this time? When I had to buy that is a permanent member, do not have any time left to pay a monthly fee! Your way of doing this is so uncomfortable in my mind! He said that as long as he was here as a manager, I could guarantee me! I still don't, cancel dropped a member, spent a few hundred dollars a month! This is a terrible gym, fitness coach manager forced me to open private teaching, I insist on, ask me why not open, I can not say love time was dead, also didn't want to open the private education, the man said the red faced, I just looked at him and said very calm and do not want to open. At last he said some sour words give me face, I just smiled! Also say other gym bad words! His gym can't stand the cold air, and the sweat is very bad. No paper towel! LA Fitness good garbage! I'm going to Google to spit up! Then I see the message of their home. Why not go and see before a comment? The choice of this family is only nearest to my home, the map is convenient! I said I had to be the woman I want to ask him, she asked what told her not to like? The manager said she had left! Horrible Fitness,don’t go there ! If you go,You will regret!</Review>< pics>

Bad service, No greeting when check in, the front lady just chat with other staff  there, this location is very dirty,  I went there once on Feb and complain to the front desk staff about the issue and also some broken hook in the lock room. steam room and shower place, I went there yesterday, still nothing be fixed,  The corporation should come to check it out. For me,  I don't want to go there again , some other location still good so far, if not ,thinking change the location , such as Gold Gym and 24 fitness.< /Review>

<Text>This gym was fine enough, but for some reason some of the members here don’t cover their mouths when they cough and sneeze. I’ve gotten sick here multiple times because of jogging next to someone Who suddenly coughed Or sneezed multiple times into open air. In addition, machines are not frequently wiped down and it’s just pretty gross. Not worth coming here to get the latest cold.<//Text>< time>

Nice gym. Compared to the rest of the LA Fitness Gyms, they at least have round plates. Hex plates, just no. It’s too complicated to do any barbell movements with them. Plus it’s dangerous. This gym has the equipment that I want. Nice and safe. The gym gives us pretty good space when we squat, bench, or deadlift and overall, it’s a pretty nice gym.<//Review>

<text>Two months ago, I went to that branch to ask for a 2 months contract because I will be there only for one month something. There were 3 staffs I talked to in two days. None of them mentioned that I need to cancel the membership myself when my contract is over. And I have even asked if there will be more billing after, the staff I spoke to at the time said no, that’s it! two months.

Two months later, I returned to Denmark. And I got an extra payment from LA Fitness through my credit card. I have tried to call them like 3 times a day to solve the issue. The answer was that the operation manager is not there. And he never calls back even if I left my number each time. 4 days later, I called again and finally got the chance to speak with him. The lady I spoke to in the beginning wasn’t willing to transfer the call to him. I have waited and he was finally there to speak with me. I understand that I didn’t go to him to cancel my membership which was his main point. But the way he spoke with me was way out of my imagination. To be honest, a month fee wouldn’t kill me. The point is the awful customer service that I have experienced. There was no apologize at all but it was only yourself to blame because you didn’t come to me. And there is no refund to the credit card like a million times he repeated. I wasn’t make the call to argue but it sounds like he was so ready for this. I had to hang up myself in the end. It was meaningless after all.

I really hope these people can respect to their conscience.< /text>< GmapID>

People who work here Sucks! If you just went in and register, then you are waiting for scam to happen. So you get all your membership set up and ready-to-go, but they say you have to wait, so you can meet them again. You meet them again, and they start to scam you by talking about "Special Training" (program). They tell you as if the thing is free (b/c you pay more but they don't tell you that) and it is a "complementary" to your "normal" workout. TOTAL BS! They will make up any kind of nasty lie just to get the money from you, and once you get signed up, they will treat you with less respect than to their friends. AVOID THIS PLACE OR AT LEST AVOID GETTING SCAMMED! You don't get what you paid for here.</Text>

BACK AT IT AGAIN !!!!!!!!!! I was a member before and I canceled my account since the gym was going down hill this was about 2 years ago , this is gym is only a few blocks from my home so I said screw it like give if another try this time I was introduced to SERGIO Aguiar he toured me around the club and explained how the gym operates , then took me back to him desk , he offered me a free trail for 15 days to make up for the bad experience I had on my last visit he didn't even try selling me he printed the pass and off I was to my workout after the we days he called me back to ask about my experience and if 15 day was enough time to try the club , he emailed me another 15 days to try again and see if I can commit to working out 3 times a week , it took me 2 days to realize this guy really cares about his clients best part was that once I sign up on a membership program I asked who his manager was and he explained he was the GENERAL MANAGER of the whole branch !!!!  His staff is great hands down this is the best service I have received in my whole life !!!< /text>

Don't go this club. They Re bunch of desperate people who try all kinds of scams to keep them employed. Don't listen to any take sale techniques.  Don't sign any contracts with them even if you cancel it within same day, they're gonna desperate try forgive you hassles to keep contract. So desperate and uneducated.
Totally agree with previous reviewer.  I'm victim of it. Trust me dont choose la fitness . There's cheaper clubs out there and much decent. Hours are flexible too. This one closed at 8p on weekend which is not good.  Friday is best time but they close at 10p. Machines broke down but they don't fix them despise complain. Go

They don't care about your health but only try to scam your money. They have no clue. When they say they help you out, don't trust a bit.</text>

This particular LA Fitness is more claustrophobic than other locations. The main workout Area is downstairs as is the pool area and it gets hot and muggy down there very easily. Air conditioning isn't up to the task of fighting the humidity. There seems to be less variety of weight machines than the Hastings Ranch location.
The Hastings Ranch LA Fitness location has a much greater diversity of clientele. And it also is a much larger, more Airy spacious and accommodating location and overall experience. Old young, fit just starting. Etc. I will come to the Arcadia location only as a last resort.< /Review>

<review>It sometimes gets very crowded. But it is convenient and has a variety of machines and helpful staff. The weight lifting machines and pool with the changing rooms are in the basement level. There's no 2nd story, it just looks like there is one. I even saw a kid friendly area.<//review><rating>4<//rating></record></dataset><record>

<Text>The staff are friendly and the place is somewhat nice. One bad thing about this place is that their dumbbells are disproportionately focused on 70+ weights when nobody uses them besides a small minority. The majority of people uses 15-45 pound dumbbells but they barely have any, leaving a lot of beginners and even intermediate users to do another machine exercise.</Text><Name>Byron Briones<//Name><Pics>None</Pics><user_id>112696460500682365104< /user_id>< date>

This Gym is understaffed big time hence all the negative reviews! Spoke with one of the managers and he stated to come in and speak with him (we spoke during his lunch break and he stated he had all positions available). We never got a chance to speak due to his busy work schedule, I left my number three times the first time when I walked in and the two other times when I called in. I never heard back from the guy... If you want to be successful at anything in life you need the proper leadership and need to be held accountable for what you say! This gym is not clean 24 hour fitness down the street is cleaner than this gym. Good luck to the staff and Management at this Gym they will need it...<//Text>

I agree with the other reviews. The sales staff here is terrible. If you're looking for a gym in Arcadia, you have plenty of other choices to choose from. This is a people business. I want to go to a gym where I feel comfortable and can say hi to the staff. This is not that kind of gym. I was considering rejoining my old gym, LA Fitness, where I was a member for 10+ years, but after receiving the poor treatment today, I would not ever give them my business again. Their sales rep "Brian" (who refused to give me his last name) refused to honor a guest pass for me to try out the gym. He said it excludes previous members even though it is not stated on the pass. It's not my problem if they can't get the wording right. But more importantly, it is the attitude in which he displayed that drove me away. I said I was really considering rejoining, and wanted to check out the classes, but without the trial pass I won't be able to come back. He told me 'you don't have to come back again.' Is this any way to treat a potential customer? If you want someone giving you attitude, you can go to LA Fitness Arcadia. The manager stood by without saying a word to resolve the situation. I won't be going back and I will take my business to Gold's Gym or 24h Fitness instead.< /text>

<review>The remodeling improved the appearance. The new matrix elliptical machines are inferior compared to the old life fitness machines. The new ones no longer automatically cycle through the metrics, there is no longer a display that will provide a track view which was critical to showing progress during a workout, the tv monitor is too close and I have to just turn it off, on a 20 minute workout it only has a four minute cooldown and unlike the previous machines the length of the cooldown can't be adjusted, the general quality is lacking and I think that is tied to the machines having the wheel in front vs the previous machines where they were in the back.  It almost appears they went with this machine because it has a smaller profile and the were able to cram more into a smaller footprint.  While I don't use the treadmills they also appear to have gone to a more primitive dispaly.< /review><pics>None<//pics></record>

ATTN: this is a great club the gym is extremely clean and the best part is the staff SERGIO the manager was of great help he offered a free trial before committing to any membership !! After the 15 days he even offered to extend the pass for another 15 days at that point I. Knew this was the club I had to join !!!! He was able to help me find a awesome program and show me a few tips on working out . Thanks again Sergio for helping me out with my membership it was a great experience and look forward to  working out 4-5 times a week !!!!!!!!< /Review>

Poorly managed. Half of the cardio machines don't work properly and the ones that have signs scheduled for service don't get fixed for months. There are people on the mats and machines with no shoes or socks. So gross! Management don't seem to see anything wrong with it and gym rules aren't being enforced. I have never been to a more unprofessional and unhygienic gym.<//review>

<Review>This place is waiting for lawsuits.. their pool walkways are slippery. I told them they should put anti-slip mats to prevent injuries due to fall but they never do anything so far.

They will toss away anything left behind and gave you different answers every time you ask about the lost and found. 1st they'll say they didn't see it. 2nd, they'll tell you they'll keep it if they see it. Then, they'll tell you that don't keep swimming suits because it touched the private parts, etc - different answers each time.

They don't have hangers to leave your towels dry. Their change room smell like urine.  They never seemed cleaning their equipment as they told me when I join their club.  Never have I seen anyone cleaning their pools as they told me it was supposed to be 3 times a day?  Huh?

All in all, this place is REALLY interested to sell you their memberships and the place can be jammed like sardine can. --- SMELL bad.

I will wait for 1 more month before closing the membership and update my report. :)</Review><gmapID>0x80c2dbafeccd374d:0x3d480df73f834aa4<//gmapID><pics>None<//pics><Date>1521566702758< /Date>< UserId.>

I cut off my membership and I 'll tell my friends and family to drop the membership as well . They're a waste of time to communicate with. Scams. Lies. Inexperienced . Managers never return calls. They should get rid of managers there. And drop the freezing of account ridiculous policy if they want pple to come back.
The freezing of account for not working out is a scam. La fitness has never been good for years now andconlt gets worst . Worst service worst management. Just go somewhere cheaper and more service oriented. Say no to la fitness.
Dont use personal trainer is waste. all useless.
Oh ya, not to mention old equipment, dirty restroom,  water everywhere,  weights are downstairs bunch of ...hard to grasp . Only few weights upstairs but they never let u use it. Only for certain pple, discrimination?
The basketball room is always bunch of males never have seen female groups playing in there. The classes dance, yoga ...are overcrowded . Ridiculous to dance like that.
There's choices and weights upstairs but never let u use them if there's no class (?).<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

WOW!!! This is one of the best gym experience I have had in my life , I have been to many gym but this one reAlly made me want to start working out again and showed me some people really do care about others , SERGIO called me since a family member just join and she place me under her support group and that gave me 30 days to try the gym during those  30 days Sergio called twice to make sure my experience was good and asked if I was in need of any assistants , after the pass expired he explained how he can offer another 15 days if I still want ready to decide to join  , after the 15 days I joined on a membership with no down payment and a low monthly upkeep it's a great gym and has a great staff !!! Thanks again SERGIO AGUIAR !!!!!!!!!!!< /Text>

<Rate>1< /Rate><Text>I have been attending this LA Fitness facility since it opened.  It went from a great brand new facility to a dump.  The equipment is not properly maintained and it has become outdated.  The carpets and restrooms are filthy.  You will be lucky to find paper towel in the restroom.

The employees are not very professional and are more concerned about sales than quality service.  The classes are overcrowded and there is no regulation on saving spaces.  If you show up for a cycle or Zumba class one person will save the space for about nine to twelve other persons leaving you with a bad spot, if you are lucky.  The fire department has showed up and stopped classes because they are so full.

When the air conditioning breaks down, stand by because it will take about a week to repair.

If you are planning to join this club make sure that you show up or take a tour at the time that you will be attending on a regular basis.  If you show up in the morning or mid day the place will be empty.

Evenings are very crowded.  No machines or weights will be available.  In an attempt to express my discontent and in hopes of betterment of the place I spoke to the manager about the club's deficiencies.  Guess what?  Nothing happened months later.  I am going to be canceling my membership.

Good luck!< /Text><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None</Response>< Gmap_id>

1) Management does not have staff clean over night.  It is disgusting to come in at opening and have locker room/restrooms filthy.
2) Clientele does not seem to have any idea of "racking your weights" or "wiping down" when done.  AND management doesn't do a thing about it.
3)  I went religiously every morning and a few of us would just start racking the weights and picking up in between our own sets in working out.  We shouldn't have to do what the management/staff are paid to do.

Air conditioner always broken down.  Summer a/c broke up, in the winter too. That too much.  Or they refuse to turn on the a/c.

Where ever the Africa American girl work, she always close 10 min early.

The agent are so rude, he don't know the day "THANK YOU" went a customer open the door for him.</Text>

This is a busy gym, morning classes are crowded, machines are poorly maintained, people often using down stairs machines as sitting place for texting and chatting.
Employees are friendly and cleaning crews are always trying to keep up but still there are times place is messy and out of paper and sanitizer.
Good location for me so hope they will improve and correct for the future.< /text>

Corporate customer service was the absolute worst. They just don't seem to care about their patrons. I came here out of the convenience of proximity to my home, but I'll gladly take my business elsewhere...</Text>< Pics>

My mother has been a long time member of this gym, and recently had a rude receptionist basically tell her that the gym can take her money and deny her access. I believe the name of the employee was Diana.

My mother lost her keychain pass so she's been accessing the gym by providing her phone number. Something that just takes a few seconds to do, and she has been doing this regularly. However this employee rudely told her that if she refused to buy another keychain pass she can't go to the gym anymore, sounds a bit like coercion. Extremely unprofessional and impolite.< /review>

pretty much what'd you expect from a large chain gym. machines are functional and everything works well enough to get an ok workout in. Management could be a little better--one of the assisted dips and pullup machine was broken for months and sometimes janitorial staff will be cleaning in the main weight room during peak hours. Also, the locker rooms could do with more regular cleaning. Can get a little dirty and stink of urine like all the time. But it's pretty much the only gym in the immediate area so it'll have to do. And it goes without saying that the sale personnel are slimy and will make you jump through hoops if you ever decide you want to stop giving them money.< /text>

By far the dirtiest L.A. Fitness in Colorado, Arizona,California. No paper towels, jacuzzi sucks the foam was brown, muddy like floors in the mens room. I would rather give it no stars. The people who give this place 4 or 5 stars must be extremly naive to think the monthly dues we pay are put to any use for this gym. Either they are employees or were coerced monetarily to say otherwise.< /Review>

<review>Signed up Just for 2 Months because I Live in Fresno. They Bill my Account Today for $54.95, and Tell me that they Won't Refund me my Money. If I Tell them to sign me up for ONLY 2 Months, why should I Even have to Call and Cancell. 2 Months is 2 Months. They also Told me I'd be able to work out at EVERY L.A Fitness, then wind up going to a Signature L.A Fitness and get told that if I wanted to work out there, I 'd Have to Pay an Extra $5.00 a Day, on Top  of what I allready had Paid. End of Story, I Pay for 2 Months, Lose 1 Month, Get Billed a 3rd Month which they Shouldn't have, and Won't Refund me my Money.<//review><Resp>None< /Resp><Name>Alfredo Martinez<//Name><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< rate>

< review>
I was a L.A. Fitness member for many years before I switched over to UFC Gym in Rosemead about three years ago. After switching, all L.A. Fitness and 24 Hour Fitness gyms seemed a bit too vanilla to me.

While this L.A. Fitness is big, you get what you pay for. The establishment doesn't offer many "toys" for fitness enthusiasts such as myself to diversify my workouts. I'm stuck with your typical boring dumbbells, weighted plates, and resistant machines. There are not kettle bells, tires or anything else outside of "typical."

Staff is always nice but I'd like to see some color in this place. Parking is super ample as it is part of a bigger plaza space so don't worry about that.<//review>

The locker smells horrible. I bend down to tie my shoe and almost past out. Why? Because they have CARPET in the locker rooms. People coming out of the shower and pool drip all over the carpet. Does it ever dry? I talked to the manager and he gave me nothing but excuses.

The pool area has slippery moldy floors due to standing want. The cement floor is not slanted correctly and they never brush clean the area. There are also no overhead flags or line to tell you where the end is when you do back stroke.<//text>

I have read such bad reviews but I really like this place. I mentioned the negative reviews to another member because it was so perplexing. He told me the recent ones were from disgruntled ex employees after the new manager Sergio had come in and cleaned house. And the older bad reviews were from the quality of services due to that old staff. It makes sense to me because it's fine now. Yes the bathrooms get dirty but there is a lot of people using them constantly. It's not always this way. When I come in the morning  the bathroom is clean and the gym is not too crowded.</review>

Writing this review based on a trial I did. One of the worst gyms I've been to. Here are some highlights:

If you want to go swimming, don't even bother. Pool has like 3 lanes that are 10m in length. So many people just standing at both ends that you can't even get a turn in your swim. Doesn't look too sanitary to me if there are 30 people in a 3 lane pool.

Basketball court only has one court with no side hoops. The waits are long for pickup games, and theres no where for you to shoot around if you so choose.

Staff is pushy to try to sell you a membership.</text>

<text>I'm on a 5 day trial membership. Skipped day 3.
Days 4 & 5 coming up.

First day, got in a shower to hose off sweat from my work day.  There was no nozzle to the showerhead. I laughed.

I jumped into another shower. The nozzle head kept flopping down. I had to wash up flat against the wall to get wet.  Hummm? I giggled.

In all this,  I'm noticing the human hairballs in shower and thoughout women's locker rooms.  Okay.

I went to pool and realize the lanes where down to two because kids need to learn swimming in last lane.  I'm cool with that.

Then I see the pool is a shade color green.
Maaaaybe it was the dim lighting.  No, I think not.

My eyes were burning from the chlorine because of the dim fuzzy water.

Second day, same of everything.
Me thinks....I look at 24 Hour Fitness now.<//text><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None<//resp><gmap_id>0x80c2dbafeccd374d:0x3d480df73f834aa4</gmap_id></record>

The staff only care about getting more memberships, meaning they keep pestering you to advertise your friends to them. The place was consistently filthy, with paper towels, wet floors, and unattended soap dispensers everywhere. Like all the previous google reviews, this location is worse for wear. To top it all off, some of the trainers were unprofessional, surly, and conceited. If you ask them a simple quick question regarding workout, they'll simply shrug you off like you were a nuisance, especially when they're training their high-paying "clients". Especially don't deal with a trainer named Sherwin. A friend of mine asked a few advice on workouts and he blatantly criticized his workout regimen without offering any examples or tweaks to his workouts. If you want a gym that works, with ample parking, it'll do. But don't expect much quality.< /Review>

used paper towels everywhere in the sink areas, locker rooms smell like mold (so bad, I had gag reflex), one particular trip, I counted THREE used bandaids on the floor around the shower area.  Almost threw up.  For this particular LA Fitness, how many used bandages on the floor is okay? One? Two? Three? Five?

The workers there are selling memberships, I've never seen a cleaning person.  The workers are also not particularly nice to existing members.  I don't really care about service, all I care is that it's clean, unfortunately, cleanliness is not one of their priorities.  This place FAILS balls!</Review>

With such a traffic of customers, it is funny to say they limited opening hours on Fridays, Sat, and Sun (After 8:00 pm is closed!!!!!!!!)
Disrespecting the customers.....
They have enough members and making money more than they need. So,  don't care about customer concern...

<Text>There is no choice for giving no star or negative stars... Just had a horrible experience this morning. The manage there is so rude without basic manner. We have been paying good membership fees for the club, why don't they just hire qualified people to work there? This is a people business, to make customer satisfy is all they really need to do, but instead they piss off all the members. The manager  Virginia is abusing her power and taking it personally towards members who filed a complaint last week due to her disgusted rudeness. Anyways, this location is really have all these uneducated people work there! Hope the corporation will do something about it!<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

5/4/2017 . So get this sheat apparently the La fitness in  Arcadia closes at 11:30 , when it clearly says 12:00AM (midnight) as it does in the contract I signed  . I got here exactly at 11:30 an they already locked the doors . I had to wait 5mins outside for a guest to walkout before I can get into the gym an use the 25mins I had left . After trying to call I had to look for a staff member because there was no one at the front desk , after finally tracking someone down and asking the member  why the doors where locked he said he normally does  that and tried to play it off like that was the norm .This guy and and the janitor literally try to get you out the doors at 11:54 so they can go home. Over the speaker they'll announce 5 minutes till closing time and a minute later the official La fitness voice over will announce its 10 MINUTES TILL CLOSING TIME. Effing ridiculous< /text>

The worst gym I've been to. My locker had been broken twice in this gym and I lost a lot of cash. When I reflected to the staff, they were unfriendly.The staff let me come back next day afternoon and said they would reply to solve.I returned on the next day, but the staff was off whole day.I called him to ask why to break a appointment.He barked me not disturb him, even abused to me. Then I spoke to the manager ,told him to dispatch a monitor in locker room to provent stolen again.Also I had a complaint for the staff’s rude and awful service that I had experienced . But the manager said They were not responsible for it and the stuff was not fault.    I have paid good membership fees, but I don't have a satisfied experience. Negative stars is only one choice for me. The stuff is pushy to try to sell you the membership, not to improve their service and manners.I would suggest people go to anoter gym!!!<//Text>

I've been going to this la fitness now for a few months since I move to arcadia area. The restroom smells so bad that I had a gag reflex and yacked out all of the pre workouts that i just drank before i went in the gym. The smell is like mold, wet carpet and a mixture of chlorine.i don't even go in the restroom any more cause of the really bad smell the staff don't seem friendly and the pool water doesn't look clean . I would suggest people go to another gym!!!<//Review>

Lots of good equipment but it is poorly maintained. Some of the padding is worn out on the workout surfaces that have padding, and some of the handles or other parts are worn or ill-fit.  Weights are not in their proper places--hard to find what you need sometimes, especially dumbells and longbars. That occurs in other gyms, too, but here it is particularly problematic because the place gets VERY crowded and it just takes a lot longer to find what you need, if you can find it at all.  I have had a hard time on some days finding a pair of matching dumbells to work with.

Also, this place is more like an Asian social club than a gym. People here occupy the machines and talk with each other, talk on their cellphones, or text on their phones instead of working out. Every day I workout there I have to ask someone to get off a machine because they're just sitting or standing at it staring at their phones or BS-ing with their buddies or girlfriends or both instead of working out. I wish there were a social club space in the facility where these folks could enjoy each other at tables with coffee or soda rather than having them occupy machines they're not really using.

The sauna can get kind of skanky, too, as people who attend this gym like to leave their sweaty handtowels on the floor when they leave as if the floor is a trash can. The sauna is often not working or "under repair."

When the place is at its peak hours (morning and evening), it is very difficult to access equipment. This is the case in a lot of gyms, but the population in this gym is so dense as to make it unusable at peak hours.

Overall, when my membership expires, I'm not coming back.< /Text>

Close to my house only reason why I came here. Trying to cancel has taken multiple trips. Operational manager on available monday thru thursday 10-6. Why no one can cancel membership on weekends beats me. Another lame example of cheap scams to steal your money.<//Review>

I really liked the fact that it was new and it wasn't over crowded. This place has always had some problems and now it has really gone to hell. They always seem to be recycling their employees, there isn't usually any of the same people there for much longer than a few months. Everyone who does work there, doesn't care about cleaning or taking care of people. They just worry about selling more memberships. There will be 6 to 10 sales people and trainers all sitting up stairs talking but yet there will be no paper towels in any dispenser in the whole building and the soap will often not be filled in the showers or sinks where people should be washing there hands to prevent germs from spreading. Often Trash cans are full in the locker rooms so there are piles of paper towels on the floor. Then usually there are weights everywhere they hardly ever clean up except for the end of the day... The employees and management here are slobs and make me sick. I wish I went to 24hr, but now that I already paid 300 dollars in start up fees I don't want to leave. There showers constantly have mold, which is gross. The other day I heard a sales person talking to a perspective member and he told the guy that its not over crowded and the guy was like yeah I usually come in between 6 and 9, so it isn't that bad? The sales person told him no. That was a HUGEEEE lie. Those are the peak hours for this gym, everyone comes in later, I think 7pm is probably the worst. Anyways I could say so much more but the bottom line is the managment is terrible and im not surprised Corporate hasent fired everyone and brought in a big gun. Except I suspect they have such high sales nobody cares what they do! They hire sales people, have them get all there friends and contacts in the gym, then fire those sales persons and keep doing it over and over! Smart conartists! Oh yeah and the dry sauna has been working now but I would suspect it wasent working for 3-4 entire months out of the year, they should owe us some money! There has also been time where the hot water was out and nobody warned me! I got in and was so surprised... I'm a real customer and this isn't a joke. These guys r fcken con artist lazy slobs who should go to jail for the way they run that place... also I heard that you have to have a ticket for some of the classes... first come first serve... this is true I saw some people infuriated... they spend all that money for " all inclusive " and then they get screwed if they can't come an hour earlyier to get a ticket.... such b.s.<//review>

I do, however,  have noticed one rude girl who works at the front desk. I am not sure what her ethnicity is, but she has caked-on makeup, short dark hair, and gives me an attitude look. I do not want to be greeted by someone who looks so depressing.</review>< pictures>

The ac is out today and it’s over 100 degrees. This is the third or fourth time in a row I’ve come to this gym and it’s out of toilet paper and paper towels.

The equipment is starting to be dated, and machines are frequently out of service.</Review>

(Translated by Google) The bath liquid in the bathroom is often not added, and no bath liquid is available at least five or six times out of ten. Two or three times out of ten times, there was no tissue. There is no exhaust system in the aisle from the changing room to the swimming pool, so that this aisle is filled with a very strong smell of chlorine at any time, which is very harmful to health

(Original)
浴室里的浴液经常不添加，十次之中至少五六次没有浴液可用。十次之中两三次没有纸巾。从更衣室到游泳池之间的过道中没有排风系统，以至于这一段过道中随时充斥着非常浓烈的氯气气味，非常有害于健康< /Review>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) This is a very miserable lesson. I was miserable when I became a member here, or personally taught me and my friends. The manager Ydam Ye spoke very well, but they all used deceptive verbal agreements. The members said that 25 results were deducted. The fee is 44.99. Where did I spend 6,000 US dollars, and I continue to deduct money from my card when the personal training expires. My body shape has not changed, my body shape has not changed, but I have been cheated.

(Original)
这个一个很惨的教训，在这里办会员，或者私教我与我的朋友都被坑得很惨，经理Ydam Ye嘴很会说，但都是使用骗人的口头协议，会员说25结果扣费44.99.我在哪里花6000美金，私教到期还继续在我卡里扣钱，体型没变，身材没变，只是得到了欺骗.<//Review>

<Review>(Translated by Google) The salesperson and the front desk said differently. When handling the card, the salesperson said that he could take the children to swim and wait for it to be done, but the front desk said no. And the front desk service attitude is not good 👎.

(Original)
业务员和前台说法不一样，办理卡时，业务员说可以带小孩子游泳，等办好了，前台却说不行。并且前台服务态度不好👎。< /Review>< GmapID>

<text>(Translated by Google) I found a Chinese male coach who wanted to ask questions. The coach said that he was not responsible for the ordinary members who directly refused me. What is the attitude? After all, I spent money, typical snobbery.

找到一位华人男教练想问点问题，教练说不负责普通会员直接就拒绝我的问题，这是什么态度，毕竟我是花了钱的，典型的势利眼</text>< userid>

Location: Good, Parking:Better, Service:Good, Food for Price: Good, Overall: Top points for making the tortillas on site. The location does not serve regular coffee. They do give you a decent amount of side extras. Xtra Guacamole is $2 xtra. I would come back again...</review>

Meat is excellent here. Menudo on weekends. Layout is cool, especially the overhead lamps. Bar opens at 5pm today.
I like this place.< /Text>

<review>Horrible management. The casino is not even packed and the wait has been over an hour to even get to the ordering area. The employees have no care in the world to hustle and get orders done out and quick, slowly rolling burritos and talking among each other. Apparently they stop making customer orders that have been waiting in like for over  hours to make the orders for the high roller customers. This system is ridiculous. The casino is loosing money this way. If you don't have two hours to wait and eat, your better off stopping at a Chipotle before arriving at the casino. Not recommended.<//review>< Pictures>

Always do enjoy coming here to Chingon to enjoy some quality Mexican food. However although today is the 4th of July, the service was busier than usual. My mom and I eat here every week only to encounter an unusual experience with the corn tortillas. Last Thursday and every Thursday that we would come the corn tortillas would never be burnt. Today after exchanging a tortilla, the second one was still burnt as shown in the picture. On busy holidays, the staff should pay more attention to each of the entrees being cooked to avoid unusual quality blunders like today.</review>

<Rate>1<//Rate><Review>Went last night to San Manuel Casino location. Not a good experience, tortilla was still raw dough and beans were hard and rice was mush. This was nothing to brag about or to be liable as chingon, no mames, this shouldn’t be associated with George Lopez. I have eaten tacos with carne de perro from a sketchy taco cart coming out from drink and drown in Juarez that tasted way better than this gringofied mess. Loved the decoration though.< /Review>< Pictures>

This place is so yummy! We have come here twice already (we have only been to this casino twice). Their tortillas are fresh and made in front of you. The menudo is very yummy, I only hoped I was able to put more hominy. We enjoyed how fresh their food taste and that it is made to order. You do have to wait in line for at least 30 minutes or more but if you don't want to wait they take orders over the phone. The first time we came here, they seemed understaffed. But the second time around, they had at least 6 people helping out with the line and registers. The worker outside helping customers with cleaning up their finished meals is so helpful. Greg walks around clean up the tables while checking on other customers to see if they need anything else with their meals such as to-go supplies, taking our finished plates and keeping the area very tidy. The manager and supervisors seems great and really helps their staff with helping the line move faster. The staff (second time around- 10/19/19 qt 3:30 PM) that made our food seemed friendlier and happier. We look forward to coming back here.</Review>

Well I didn’t even want to give it this star but it wouldn’t let me comment. The customer service was bad our tacos were cold they got our order wrong and then the girl that took the order wanted my boyfriend to take over the bag our food was in as if she didn’t believe him we already had our food out getting ready to eat it was bad enough we had to finish putting all the garnishes on our food. The taquitos were burnt and this was over priced. The side of rice and beans looked like something most restaurants give as samples and the menu got cut to 3 items. The Decor was nice. I will not go back. El pollo loco is better and cheaper. Save your money and time.... 👎🏼</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>{'time': 1598201347016, 'text': "Thank you for the feedback.

This place is similar to Chipotle's in the way the food is prepared and served but the food is more Mexican street food style which includes homemade horchata and the Mexican" style corn on the cob so soft with a lot of flavor. Mmm mm mm! Damn! Can't forget to mention they also make the tortillas from scratch!<//Review>

<review>This place use to be the best place to get a Carne Asada burrito, or carne asada tacos. They got my order wrong, so it took 2 hours to get my food, because I had to get in line 3 times just to ask for my food, and get my food. Anyhow, the carne asada doesn't have the great flavor it use to have, it was dry, no flavor, beans weren't the same, the rice was hard, in a small burrito, at a higher price. The only thing good was the tortilla. Also, there wasn't any habanero salsa anymore. The tacos weren't good either. Worst customer service I have had in a long time. I'll make sure I eat before coming into the casino. Too much money for food that isn't food anymore, with bad service.<//review>< user_name>

The restaurant itself is very inviting and great atmosphere! It was my first time ever eating at a George Lopez restaurant and it was delicious! I got a chicken burrito with rice/beans and every condiment they had to offer and it was just off the hook! That fresh flour tortilla👌. The customer service was spot on as well from the friendly food makers and my cashier Luciano he was very helpful and polite. Will absolutely visit again when I'm at San Manuel.</text>

I ordered the bowl w/chicken and he ordered the Asada burrito (huge) both meats have lots of flavor. They also had Jamaica and Tamarind drinks so I took a little taste of both yummy...
One last good thing,  they have the good Ice but don't take my word go try this place for yourself.
Its the kind of place that makes you want to go back, George maybe you can give Trejo's a few tips.</Text><pics>None< /pics>< response>

I don't mind standing in line. It's a different a thing . that when it was my turn to order. I was informed that the potatoe was not available for another 10 minutes. My wife order shrimp tacos and she told me that they we're overcooked. Just as they take the time to take orders from the other customers as a perv. They should have someone to talk to the customers and ask if anyone needs to order something that needs to be prepare in advance. People that are in line are customers to. Looking forward to returning soon. Thank you<//text>

It’s good but not great. Think Chipotle. I got a burrito and the thing is large and has good flavor but the meat had a lot of fat mixed in. I had al pastor. I was also hoping for a margarita and they don’t serve anything until after 5. A bit more like fast food than expected. I was hoping it was more like a restaurant. Better off going to Tios Tacos.</text>

San Manuel Casino has a George Lopez's Chin... Inside their food is cooked fresh each day & is home made. You can see them making the Tortillas by hand which is unique in it's own way. I always eat there Chicken Burritos with everything included down to the sour cream. Yummy yummy good 🤗 so have a good night sleep tight. Good nite & God bless!< /Review>

<review>I Loved the place. The food was awesome it was authentic Mexican cooking presented that way with pots and skillets just the way they do it at home. A + George for capturing the feel of home-cooked Mexican food. It's a fast-casual restaurant but the quality is superb just great flavors good cuts of meat quality liquor at the bar just in a class job George excellent! The only thing that I would suggest is have your servers be a little bit more engaged cuz I bet 85% of your customers are New to your setup, like myself I didn't know I could add beans and rice to my order for a dollar more each item. What's Mexican food without beans and rice? It's a plate of tacos. It takes a whole team gather together to embrace the idea and the concept that were selling here of home-cooked flavorful Mexican food rice beans cilantro lime You Name It We got it and you're going to love it! Get everybody behind that idea and you'll shoot right out of the Galaxy. I would have gave it more stars George but 5 was all they had.

It would be Awesome if you could host like maybe once a month so new comic talent. A way for new talent to give a 3 minute routine with possibly some veteran commentary afterwards<//review>< Pics>

I waited about 40 minutes in line just to find out they don't have the vegetable dish that is up in the menu, all the staff member did is add just more lettuce. If they are not carry that item take off the menu. I also think they take to long to take the orders. If they had another restaurant next them this wouldn't happen people would have a choice.</review>

5 stars when it comes to the food. This is the only reason why we come back and tolerate the long line. I cannot even describe how slow they move here. I can move faster than these guys, it’s ridiculous. Needs so much improvement.<//Text>

Cold food, small portions, high pricing, and dont forget the flies. I rather go to Chipotle. And for the person addressing these reviews, what a way to show your concerns about the clientele. One small piece of advise, customer is always right.  Never going back.

This review is for the location in Arizona.<//Text>

< Review>
Came in here to check out what this place was all about. Walked in and noticed it isnt a sit down restraunt but a Chipotle style set up. We waited in line for an hour and ordered 2 of the asada filled baked potatoes with the works and flour tortillas on the side. They are homemade. Which is great. Workers are slow, food is average. Nothing special going on here. An hour wait for Chipotle is what it boils down to. The live band in the bar area is the only highlight of this place.</Review>

<Rate>5<//Rate><review>The best Mexican food I've EVER had.  The tacos (beef and pork) wers absolutely delicious, and the sides to add were tasty and fresh.
The best was the shrimp 🌯 burrito.  I've not seen 🍤 shrimp that size since I was a little girl and caught them myself, net fishing at the lical "town dock".  Once again, ALL of the additional ingredients were very fresh and extremely tasty.  This burrito was humongous, and I shared it with 3 others as part of my super.

<text>Great food, a little expensive but good. We went to the one located in the Vee  Quiva Casino in AZ. My wife had the Carne Asada tacos, and I had the the Carnitas burrito which were good. The beans were Amazing great flavor to them. The guacamole, chips and Elote were great also a little more cheese on the Elote would've been a little better but otherwise it was all great tasting  Good job George, way to represent the San Fernando Valley.<//text>< UserId.>

<text>Was there last Thursday 5/13/21, took me like over 30 minutes to order, the only thing I asked was for green salsa and they gave me 2 little cups 😡 for 7 carne asada burritos, 3 chicken burritos and 2 al pastor tacos, 126$, their Subway style prep doesn’t work for the load of person that attend and only one prep bar, next time I will just go to Tacos Joe on Highland for that size order because they are good but only if you order small meals.< /text><pics>None< /pics><resp>{'time': 1564846539635, 'text': 'Thank you for the feedback and the five stars!

The service was horrible but the food was WORSE!!! Not one item in the intire order was hot or even close to warm there was 11 of us that order.  The girl begin the counter couldn't even get the beans of the spoon to put on the burritos n bowls we order thats how cold they were so she decides to add oil to mix them to try n get them of the spoon. Cold oil on cold beans dont go well trust me on this one!!! I order the 3 roll tacos wish they were premade very difficult to shew them tacos were so stale and cold! We were all so disappointed i gotta tell you this has been the WORSE!!! food experience by far at a restaurant.  Its a chame to call this mexican food im sorry but its not even close to what our mexican cuisine has to offer.<//review>< date>

We drove 2 hrs in traffic just to find out they dont like kids here, or anyone under 21 for that matter. We saw the billboard to Jorge lopes kitchen and it did not say anything about being a 21 and over establishment. To bad my family and I will never come back here. Way to inform the public.  The security guard was very rude when stopping us before we came in. I hate the experience overall.

And I see the response already. Thanks for the comment i will pass it to the team...</text>

< Review>
What started off to be a good experience turned in to a awfully disappointing one. My wife is disabled and we were immediately greeted and said we can go ahead and be seated and she would take our order....very accommodating. She went over the menu and gave us some time to decide...she took our order and then about 25 min later finally brought our food to the table. ( there were many patrons that had their orders within a few minutes ). We did inform her that we would be eating here...however our food was brought in a to go bag with the explanation they were out of trays...we had food missing and the rice was opened and all over the inside of the bag. It made us feel very unwelcomed. We asked for a refund as we were no longer going to eat there. The manager came over listened and apologized for the long wait and said it was because they were backed up in the kitchen....she offered us the refund and asked if we would like to keep the food....we declined and just took our refund....<//Review>

The food is great, but please don't eat it, not until they  raise the glass at the food bar and cover the food properly. Everyone spits on the food, especially taller guys as they place their orders. It's just disgusting!</text>

This has the best burritos, and it’s like chipotle but better.  Always has a long line but worth it.  The horchata is to die for! But they should have a sign saying when they don’t have any because of the long lines. Churros are whatever. Live bands are always awesome. Great customer service here too especially with all the old people getting free food from coupons and them complaining over everything.< /Review>

Tortillas for burrito sort of home made taste but something is missing some  flavor .Guacamole sauce too tangy over powers flavor of the burrito churros are delicious best churros ever !!! Taquitos are amazing too just don't put that guacamole sauce<//Text>

Good food but there was a 1 hour line to get food.  When we received our food, the foid became cold.  Reason for minus 1 star.   Part of the problem for the long lines was the casino was giving away $10 coupons to the George Lopez Chigon kitchen.< /review>

Food was basic, then I got off my seat to go to restroom waiters threw away half my food and a full beer. When I confronted them they said it was unattended but my jacket was in my seat. They dint even replace the 6$ beer</Review>

<Review>I really enjoyed being able to choose my ingrediants/toppings for my stuffed baked potato.  You choose your own toppings for anything you want.  Tacos, burritos etc..  It was very good, and i loved the home made tortillas.  Being in a casino there is a bit of a wait to get up to the ordering area, but well worth the wait.
I would definitly go there again if i'm at the casino.  I hope he opens one in Palmdale!<//Review><name>Debbie Leduc</name><Pics>None< /Pics></record>

The construction of our sandwiches was okay. My fiancé had a melt, yet it looked the same as a regular footlong. It was loose and not well held together with the cheese, like it should be. My sandwich was pretty dry and seemed to be missing an adequate amount of mayonnaise and mustard as ordered. We were only in Ripon for an appointment, so we won't be ordering from this location again. I will stick with my favorite location here in Stockton in the future.< /review>

<Text>This Subway is so amazing! I came in to get three different sandwiches and three cookies for an event I had that afternoon. The lady who assisted me went above and beyond to help me with my options and quickly make the sandwiches. She was so kind and the sandwiches turned out perfect!

<Review>The food is great! I love it so much. It's such good sandwiches for such low prices. Though i feel like the employees can sometimes act a bit annoyed but they may just of had something bad happen to them. I'm not too sure but overall it's amazing!< /Review>< pictures>

<Rate>4</Rate><review>Everything is really good. Except for the onion burgers. I ordered a regular sonic cheeseburger, and they loaded it up with fresh onions. I literally had to spit out my first bite because of how much onion there was. I wish you guys can see how much onion I just scooped off my burger.

<text>It's 12:17 AM and the lady on the Drive-Thru speaker had attitude and was sounding real bothered when we were asking questions, she kept on saying their were no large cups, and then we ended up getting some afterwards...? Then we asked for no jalapeños then we received what looks like a handful of them... To the lady that took our order if you hate your job, QUIT! don't take it out on the customers!<//text>< Rating>

I usually go to Dairy Queen but I was too tired to stand in line. So just a few blocks away is Sonic. I ordered a small chocolate sundae and my husband ordered a strawberry shake. He loved all the fresh strawberries in it and my sundae was delicious! Would I go back? YES<//Text>

<Text>Food is always great and so is the service, ALWAYS A LINE HERE! The 4 star is because they have been out of things on the last couple of visits and we don't find out until after order has been placed. Otherwise, it is a family favorite.<//Text>< gmap_id>

<review>I stopped by the drive through this past Saturday. Customer service department needs a little help. It would be great for the people taking the orders to ask for the size of the drinks and to ask one to repeat the order if they misheard the first time. Instead, the person who took my order stayed silent and didn't really ask if I needed anything else. The food was enjoyable. Loved the onion rings.< /review>< pictures>

The food is good here. I like the location of this place. As well for the the drive up, park to order and enjoy meal on the spot or drive thru. The order is delivered to vehicle by employees in skates. Which is pretty cool. Great customer service.< /review>

< review>
I waited for a long time in a slot after pressing the red button, only to heard a lady saying "I'm sorry, we are only serving drive thru now ( it was 12:30 am, they close at 2:00 am), I proceed to the drive thru. I order after 5 min, I waited another 10 min, when I notice that they were taking food to cars recently parked on the slots. The guy in roller blades spilled one drink so it took another extra five minutes to deliver the food. Cups have a really lousy top that fall out very easy. Food is naa. Not coming back soon<//review>

Location is open late. Great spot to get shakes. Buffalo bite are good and chili tater totes are delicious. Be careful workers deliver food on rollers skates.< /Text>

<Review>There's not much to say. Sonic's is a great place for a late night snack. Shakes are always my go to #strawberry #cheesecake I do wish as a Chicago Native that the Chicago Style Hotdogs actually tasted like one and the onion rings could be better but the selection they have is big enough to find favorites.<//Review>< pictures>

The location is kind of hard to get in and out of. This is a poor choice for any kind of fast food place. That being said, this was my first time at a sonics and It was kind of a mixed review. The food was okay. Not bad, not great. The cherry limeade was really good however. They had several things I would like to at least try and their prices are kind of high, but not too bad. We'll have to see what the next try has to offer.</Text>

<review>Why are they so expensive? The food is eh, mediocre to be exact, but you can easily spend $40 on 4 slushies, 4 value burgers and 1 side of tater tots. Not only that, half the time the food is on the cold side. I'd rather go down the street to a mom and pop shop and spend the same to get more.< /review>< Pictures>

The chicken  was very dry, obviously wasn't recently  made.  Also extremely salty.  In addition we ordered 3 breasts and 1 thigh.  We got 2 breasts and 2 thighs.  Threw most of it away. Won't go there again.<//Text>

They need to update there  business  hours on google, that or the employees  decided to close early. I am highly upset because they let my boyfriend  and i sit for like 10 mins without anyone telling us anything, until finally they got on the speaker and rudely told us they were closed< /Text>

The chicken  was very dry, obviously wasn't recently  made.  Also extremely salty.  In addition we ordered 3 breasts and 1 thigh.  We got 2 breasts and 2 thighs.  Threw most of it away. Won't go there again.</Text>

<Review>I was new to the concept but it was a good experience.  Not intended for someone with short arms. I  had to open my car door to press the screen to order or maybe I should have pulled up closer. Either way, I will go back again and compare it with my First time.</Review>< Pictures>

I love they way they serve their food and there ability to get the lone lines moving and serve the indoor and sittinf cars all in one. Plus they will stock you with ice. Food isn't the best but the shakes are worth it</review>

Awhile ago I came to this Sonic and waited a long time. I order their #1  burger. Cars that arrived long after me
got their food before me.
Same thing happened again yesterday.
I was the only one there when I showed up and 3 cars got their food before I got mine<//Text>

< review>
8pm parked in drive in, pressed button, waited 5 minutes, lady said "I'm sorry, we're only doing drive through at this time", drove into drive through, waited 15 to get to turn to order, press button, the person taking order says "I'm sorry we're not taking any drink orders tonight",  homeless guy walking from car to car  in drive through asking for change,  I get honked at for not leaving enough space for fellow drive through customer to pass me (though he had plenty of room), I back up to give him more room, he thinks again and drives off with enough space for 2 cars to pass. Will never come back here. Not worth for fast food or any food for that matter.</review>

The worst breakfast I have ever tried I got a ultimate burrito with tater tots and a Coke. Both the tater tots and a burrito were nasty. The burrito had no flavor the tortilla with cold, the tater tots taste like fish sticks and it had no salt. The only thing I liked was that soft drink Coke and it had small ice. I love there smoothies I just won't ever order anything else but a smoothie. I am totally disgusted. Customer service was pretty good. If I can give it no stars I would. I spent 18$ for something that wasn't even good, wish I could get a refund.<//text>

What a mess! The parking lot is really small with little order so everything gets gridlocked. They've made the best of the bad situation but if you come here when it's busy expect to be stuck and blocked in for a while. Food was alright.</Review>

<Text>A flashback from yester year,  drive up diner. Ordering was simple pushing a button, paying was inserting card and the hop was friendly and was prepared with condiments. Food wasnt remarkable but good for quick bite. We had burgers, fries and onion rings were tasty and had nice crunch. Kids menu available. We didn't have slush or frosty, another visit is called for.<//Text>< pics>

The service was pretty good, they help us save money every time we go by tweaking our order a little to fit the special that's going on, so I really appreciate that. It's always a fun atmosphere to be around since they roller blade, and sometimes after car shows you can see all of the classic cars parked here grabbing a bite to eat and hanging out. The only thing is that their food is just okay, so I only go for the drinks and the shakes</Review>

Its lacking in quality and customer service. Teach the youngsters what customer service is already, and also educate them in how to solve simple problems. That would help.< /review>

During my visit at Sonic I ordered food to go and waited quite a bit for an order of 3 items. Didn't look particularly busy, but alas I waited well over 10 minutes. I don't recall the exact price but the total amount due for my order seemed very high for a fast food place. I feel there are plenty of other places with a better bang for your buck and faster service to boot. Just not a fan.< /Text>

<Text>The only place in Riverside that a man doesn't have a restroom and they will literally tell him to go to the park behind the restaurant there are no employees on the floor inside the restaurant at any time and that you push a button and the last time I was there there was a woman probably in her mid-to-late forties it was a hundred something degrees or was this Monday that just passed and she was sitting under a bush trying to stay cool they said she'd been there all day I seen her she was pretty much asleep it took me 15 minutes to get her attention and go get her some water well all the employees skated by her and did not do nothing to help her<//Text>< Pictures>

<Text>Horrible service. Waited over 15 minutes just to place an order which was never even taken. The sign says if paying cash to just pull forward instead of ordering thru their machine which I did. They never even acknowledged that I was even there. Multiple orders taken much later than when I got there. I called to give them a heads up on my level of service without much concern placed on the matter by them. So sad, we actually liked this place in the past.</Text>< pics>

Always good food, if you like Sonic. I just wish they would dip into their pockets a little bit and get better containers for the chili cheese Coney's. The plastic sleeve they put it in created a mess of cheese and chili. But, it's still worth it for the best fast food chili cheese dog.</text>

<review>Food was good but their bbq sauce looked like it was really old. Like as if there was another creature inside of it. Otherwise good food.< /review>< pics>

As expected... Kids love to eat in the car... Always upgrade to a shake with your meal... It is a bit pricey. It is good.. Just not as good as the Habit.... And the prices are about the same</text>

Their pretzel twists are extremely delicious as well. My favorite wings there have to be the Asian. And, lastly, my all-time favorite shake is the Oreo cheesecake👍😋< /Text>< pics>

I don't know why I thought it would have gotten better, but Sonics food taste like everything is warmed up in the microwave and slathered in cheese wiz. I usually only get the slushies and tater tots from Sonics,  but I was hungry and thought it's been over a year since I've last eaten at here, maybe it's gotten better.

The cookie dough shake is pretty average in taste but on the pricey side. The grilled cheese sandwiches were alright,my son thought the bread to be to mushy but they are rather cheap in price< /Text>< time>

We go here ALL THE TIME,  and always spend $25-30. Ordered 2 double bacon burgers and these guys gave us burned up obviously hours cold burgers,  cheese wouldn't even melt on these dried out little patties.  Usually a decent place to eat but after wasting so much money on this trip I doubt we will return. For shame,  Sonic.<//text>

Great variety of drinks and shakes. Love how the servers come out on roller skates makes feel a bit cooler or special than any other fast food place. Also commercially are great advertise a lot but they are a bit repetitive with the setting of the commercials so sometimes think I'm seeing the same one and don't pay attention to it.<//text>< Pictures>

Update, 11-17-2018. Back for another round got the double stack cheeseburger and honey BBQ boneless wings and they were less than good. Took awhile and weren't that good. Must have been very hungry last time.
Only two stars this time.</Review>< pictures>

<Review>This restaurant is always very hit or miss. Yesterday I bought a corn dog and tater tots, while the tots were very tasty if a undersalted; the corn dog was the most disgusting and sorry excuse for a corn dog I've ever eaten. I've had microwaved frozen versions of the food that have been far better. As to not draw out a rant about such a silly and mediocre food, I'd say the shakes are good, the tots are okay, and everything else is hot trash. Oh and it's the third time I've ordered the corn dog in case it was just the first or second time, but each time it's soggy and cold.<//Review>< Pictures>

Had never gone to a Sonic before. Good and organized service. Tried the Oreo cheesecake and the strawberry cheesecake shakes. I liked the strawberry cheesecake shake better. The other one felt like an odd combination and like lemon was added to the shake. I will stick with the strawberry one.
Would go again<//review>

They have the greatest milk shakes I have ever had from any fast food restaurant and their food isn't bad either. It's super cute that the waiters and waitresses come roller skating out to your car with your order. Props to them because I couldn't do it !!!!<//Review></record></dataset><record>

I rate that s as one of the most horrible places I have ever gone to. I'm not sure who in their right mind would wait for a HUGE length of time, deal with carhops who clearly think that they bring more to the table then they actually do, and the food isn't warm, does not taste that good, and it's value is disprotionate to competition. You would think that people would truly understand that it doesn't come from car-hops on skates (mostly-only females, it seems,) that brings in people but it's THE QUALITY and SERVICE that drives a successful restaurant.

This place will go out of business, it's only matter of time ( which you will lose a lot of by spending any of it here.< /text>

I went around 12:45am since I start work at 2am. My tots were stale and just heated up in the microwave since it was close to closing. Not fresh at all. My boyfriends chicken sandwich was ice cold. And my sandwich was just as cold. The only good thing that was ordered was the sprite. I understand its by closing time but you're not closed yet. Don't just half fast peoples food. People who work night shift need great fast food too. This sucked. We couldn't come back and ask for some fresher food because once when we got back to work. It was passed 1.< /text>

<review>Sonic is very good but this location needs to have morning breakfast food. It is relatively close to the freeway and people would like to get off get breakfast and get back on the freeway. Unfortunately breakfast is not served until after 830... Most people already have to be with to work by then. The drive-through portion of this sonic is often a hot mess you can easily wait 20 minutes for your food.</review><username>Allison Dean</username></record></dataset><record>

<user>104965309074273700436< /user><Text>We "ate in". The place was clean, servers friendly, and food delicious! I don't recommend the coke icee. It was watered down.

On the positive side - we asked them to replace it twice. Then had a limeade instead. Each time they happily replaced my drink. I was very pleased at this point. They even placed my order when they brought the wrong one.

This is a good place to go.< /Text><user_name>Marcia Morgan< /user_name></record>

<Review>Great food. Clean facility. Friendly staff. Just at times you're literally waiting to be seen. This particular restaurant has a button you press to let them know you're in the restaurant.  But they still take forever to come out the kitchen. But once they come out they are so friendly you forget how long you had to wait.< /Review><gmap_id>0x80dcb0cee2f42343:0xbacfff12064d7ffe< /gmap_id><Rating>4<//Rating>< Pics>

<review>Just ok not much to write home about. Weirdest disappointment was the fact that they have young boys on roller skates for car hops. How gay is that? Worse yet is these innocent kids don't even realize that they are being setup as Twink 🍰.
Where are the babes on skates ? Not cool Sonic.<//review><Rate>3</Rate><pics>None<//pics>< Date>

The food was good but it's kind of expensive especially for a family of 7 it was very nice inside they had four TVs on buy the tables so you could sit inside don't only have to stay in the car which I loved bathrooms were very clean well the women's one was anyways they didn't have a separate women's bathroom it was a shared bathroom for men and women< /Review>

<Text>The first few times I've been there I got my food fresh.. but I went today and my food was old like they just reheated it all up. That's gross in my opinion. Should've just gave it to me cold and I could've reheated it if you guys were gonna do that.</Text><gmap_id>0x80dcb0cee2f42343:0xbacfff12064d7ffe<//gmap_id>< Response>

Sonic is welcome change to the standard fast food offerings in our area.  They have a lot of menu choices from hot dogs to burgers to boneless chicken wings.  They offer tater tots or fries and boast a huge number of specialty drinks like flavored lime aid, slushies, and milk shakes</Review>

Ordered at the parking with car hop. The order was wrong the first time, our car hop corrected the issue. Had 2 orders for one car. The bags we got were mixed up, both orders together. Next time, will have to go in and stand in line if want your order right.< /Review>

I like that it's convenient, sometimes our order gets messed up, but the servers do work hard to make it right. I like the chili cheese coney and the tots. It's a little on the pricey side, that's why its better to take advantage of the specials. I hope this is helpful.<//text>

I just had the best experience at this Riverside Sonic and it is all thanks to Dominique.  I've been to other Sonic Burgers and the experience has not been good, but Dominique was AWESOME!!!  She was extremly nice and helpful and just sincerely made my experience a great one.  Dominique provides the type of service that will keep me coming back to Sonic Burger, this location in particular.  She is a true example of management greatness and she deserves acknowledgment!!<//text>

The food is only okay, but there is a wide variety of drinks and desserts available. Come between 2 and 4 (2 and 5?) for half priced drinks. The cherry limeade is great!< /Review>

A preferred place for cheap food. Food was so appetizing. The place has a great atmosphere. My apartment is far from here, so I can't visit often.< /text>

<Review>Food is great only thing I don't like is that when we needed something we had to wait until some one came out from the back and what's the big idea about having everything closed up in the kitchen? Every fast food restaurant you can see the cooks cooking you're food and here we can't why is that??< /Review><user_id>105849976524516233610< /user_id>< rate>

Food is always hot. People are always great. They check for condiments and make sure I'm doing ok. Didn't even know I could call for a refill. Yes! That's awesome.

Great experience, reminds me of when I was a kid. Great ice cream/shakes..didn't have burger thought of it more as a dessert location. It ir directly kn corner which makes an easy access.  Staff was very knowledgeable with recommendations. I'm thinking sonic should make more locations. I have been to some of the older locations and this is a newer one. Defintely thumbs up.<//Review>

<review>With selections to spend days on, so many stalls and space to park or drive thru, this Sonic location is super convenient. Given the busy location, I never seem to have trouble finding a spot to park in. Getting in and out is pretty easy. The Sonic staff always seem to have the food out quick, regardless of time of day and how busy. Went in around midnight on a Saturday and had my stuff super fast! Like Sonic!<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures></record></dataset><record>

Something about this place is just fun! It makes you not care that the food tastes so/so. The health factor is non-existent. Yet somehow I think I'd go back once in a great while. Might be cool if you have kids or are traveling through the city.< /text>

<text>What makes it special to my family ate the drinks. There are so many possible varieties that you can have a different flavor combo every time you go. My fav is the blue coconut with vanilla or limeade slush strawberry. The food is alright. Nothing amazing but edible. But good for fast food
The Icecream is a nice variety like the drinks.< /text></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Typicaly this Sonics never fails me ! But today 08/27 THEY FAILED ! So there hours are supposed to be till 2am but tonight they closed prior I pulled in there drive thru a little after 1am and sat for a few minutes with no response there was a car behind me that sat for a few minutes after I left and I'm sure they waited as well . Sun-Thurs there supposed to be open till 2am n the weekend 3am but evidently they dont follow there posted hours especially when they get delivery . Which being a former fast food worker they should have a separate team for the delivery.  As well as for drice thru , I came to get a midnight snack and was very disappointed.  I'm sad to say but I'm disappointed .</Text></record>

<rate>2< /rate><Name>Betty Foster Diehl</Name><text>This was the first time I had ever been to a Sonic burger. The menu was a little confusing. Tried to ask some questions about different things, they never answered a question that was asked. When the order came it was all messed up. Had ordered a strawberry smoothie received a mango smoothie ordered another smoothie it came as a coconut smoothie no way don't like coconut. Ordered  The Ultimate Chicken burger they said they're made as you ordered them. This one the bottom bun was soaked all the way through a soggy mess the lettuce was wilted the chicken was cold in it the top bun felt like it just came out of the refrigerator. It was disgusting one bite nobody wanted to eat it. The same thing with a corn dog it was bad tasting. The one thing that was good was the chocolate waffle blizzard. Out of a $37 order the only thing that was eaten was some tater tots popcorn chicken and the ice cream blizzard.</text>< time>

<Text>The variety of drinks is great and all delicious.  The food is not up to pare with the drinks.  I only go here for "dessert".  My kids like the experience of the drive thru and how they roller skate the order out to you, it is always fun when we go.< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< Gmap_id>

Fast. Hot food and good service.  Not a 5 star because of a new employee.  Also, I rang the bell and they acknowledged me (male voice)and then never returned.< /Review>

Weak first impression. Poor front counter etiquette. During my initial visit there were 2 or 3 different customers standing by front counter waiting for someone to take their order. There we several employees in the kitchen area talking, laughing or preparing food for customers parked outside (I could see thru the Window on the kitchen door). Only a few tables inside but some had not been cleaned. On positive side: the food was good with a good selection.< /text>

<Review>I like the food and drink, and it's the closest Sonic to my home so I put up with the lousy service. The car hops are friendly, but the people who take the orders STILL haven't gotten any of my countless orders correct since they first opened! It's ridiculous... we end up waiting 45 minutes for what should be a 20 minute wait TOPS. Hopefully the listening skills improve as time goes on when it comes to taking orders, because Sonic is pretty good compared to other fast food places.<//Review><pics>None<//pics><Response>None< /Response>< Gmap_id>

<Review>I had never been to Sonics and was so excited, but what you pay for you don't get. I got chili and I swear there was only 1 bean and the meat was smashed up so small you could hardly tell it had any meat. I don't understand how places can charge so much and give so little. There was no one inside to help, I stood there for 15 minutes while more people came in to find help.< /Review>< pics>

The card reader was broken so I had to pull forward and wait a long time to pay & get my food.  The tater tots were warm & crisp.  The corn dog was pretty small.  They need one that is adult sized.<//Text>

<Review>Ordered a grilled cheese, onion rings, and a limeade.  Got a grilled cheese that was only grilled on one side.  Really!  How do you forget to grill the side that is looking at you as you take it off the skillet?  The onion rings tasted like french toast, when I asked for some salt, the girl at the register couldn't find it.  She needed someone else to show her it was right beneath her register.  Lastly, the beloved limeade, was Sprite.  Sonic is definitely not what it used be.< /Review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

The workers didn't seem to care about their jobs and it made me feel u welcomed. The food here is not as good as other sonic drive ins I've been to.</text>

Great place for shakes, slushes, and ices. Other food isn't a standout, but doesn't offend either. Go for the ice cream and remember to tip the skating car-hops.< /Review>

Food is average, could have just gotten Burger King. Food took forever to arrive and was all wrong. Missing pickles on both burgers, missing sauce on one order, no napkins or straws or stirrers and sugar for coffee. Speaking of coffee we asked for it at least 5 times and didnt get it until we were all done eating. Music and TVs were cool I guess but the chairs facing them were icy cold and hard, uncomfortable. Just seems like everyone was really busy and messing up. Parking was an absolute disaster, just nowhere near enough room, and the restaurant is in a really awkward spot. We arent gonna come back.... At least the prices were good.

Edit: downgraded to 2 stars, as two of us got food poisoning the next day.< /Text>< pics>

<Review>If you have time and patients for the fact that they make you wait at the counter at least ...AT LEAST 5 minutes every time you order or need a refill or even need to go to the bathroom cause they are all in the kitchen player around , then this is the place for you....also, they pick and choose who used the bathroom...yes even paying customers get told NO for a bathroom token...yes a bathroom token...there are a few really sweet employees ...then there are those who judge and or feel superior and day you can't have a token...or if they give you one, they stand outside the door and knock after 1 and 47 seconds of you being in there..yes, I timed it ....food is expensive...large drink 2.89... but I go there everyday ..<//Review>< Pictures>

PATHETIC!!!
One of the things I ordered was a cup of hot water.  30 minutes later I was told that they were too busy to get me a cup of hot water.  I reminded them twice during that 30 minutes of my hot water.  It's not rocket science to boil water but they can't seem to master it.
I wanted to speak to the manager but was told that he was too busy to speak to me.  REALLY?  They don't know what customer service is.  This is the most pathetic, so-called restaurants, EVER!

Even though we paid and were told our drinks were on their way and never showed up.... They were friendly and very busy, so I can't even be upset. I'll definitely be back.<//Review>

The Riverside location is terrible!
I will never come here again.
I asked for a strawberry shake with mnms.
The guy came to the car without it the first time then came back the second time and we asked them specifically if it had the mnms in it and he told me yes. I stirred my shake and there were no mnms. We tell the lady over the speaker and she comes to our car and tries to explain that you won't suck them out of the straw... Honey I promise you there were no mnms in it. Then I tell her just forget it I don't want it anymore, she shrugs her shoulders and walks away and never came back with my refund. Terrible customer service on her part. I will never come here again!< /review>

Friendly car hops its always always better service when using car hops. Don't eat inside unless you like rude slow service and eating in a refrigerator ( freezing). Oh and never trust your change they don't do math well.<//Review>

Fun to go to for the Ice Cream. Eat in the car and the service is done on roller skates which adds to the experience. Not a fan of the food but worth a visit for Dessert<//Text>

Terrible, ordered almost 15$ worth of food on 12/16/18 off of DoorDash app. Currently 9 Months pregnant...and was highly disappointed. Food was cold, did not look fresh, and cheese looked microwaved on the chili cheese fries I ordered and Pretzel dog...upon calling we gave them all the information to our order and wanted to come in personally to have our ordered made fresh, I was told they never made my order and that I called the wrong Sonic! Which was a complete lie after looking up our doordash order again on the app! Will not ever be going back and would not recommend ordering off of doordash app At ALL< /Text>

<text>The kids that work here might get my order right one in ten times. I usually end up getting the opposite of what I want. Corporate needs to train the employees better. Given them more than enough chances to fix their mistakes but when your order is consistently wrong, you run out of chances to give. Not only that, but the quality has continued to decrease since this restaurant opened. There are dozens of other places that do what they do and do it better, and they will be the ones receiving my business going forward. Examples have not been given at this time but can be included upon request, or upon a later edit.<//text><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

<rate>3< /rate><Review>Love this place HOWEVER they recently hired a bunch of new people and the ordering service has gone down hill. Hopefully this is just a learning curve but darn it's annoying. It use to take 40 seconds to order a slush and now it's been taking 3-4 mins for them to type it in right. Other than that the roller skaters are always on point.< /Review><Resp>None</Resp><user>113723588659765142648<//user></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Poor customer service and lack of I believe taking the job seriously. Needless to say we had to move from a carhop stall because it was 12:03am even tho it was our second order, so we proceeded to go thru drive thru like the rude employee said but then sat in their drive thru til 12:16 am just for an employee to start helping us again, mind you there was no other cars in the drive thru at this time.< /Review>< pics>

Good food & nice atmosphere, nice car hops and service. Only complaint I have is that it seems like whenever I go, car hops tend to forget to bring you what you asked for if you ask for certain condiments or anything extra.</review>

Happy hour is awesome . Great deals if u go at the right time. They stop serving at the carports about midnight so u have to go thru the drive thru and there can be a lot of people. But all in all not too bad of a wait .</text>

Tried this place twice and left there very disappointed.
Fist time was when they first opened.
The second time was on the spur of the moment.
Both time our food was Lukewarm and the Chili Dogs had less the "T-spoon of chili.
The Soda's had way too much ice.< /review>

1st time at Sonics. Menu print too small. Person taking our order kept repeating it wrong (4 times). Paid by cc at the order board. Qhen our food came out, we were told that it said we opted for pay by cash. We paid by cc again. Holding onto the receipt to verify we were not charged twice. The fuy who delivered our food was very nice and apologize for the inconvenience. Because of him (Nick) we gave it 2 stars. Otherwise it would have been zero. I'll give it one more try in a couple of weeks to be fair.<//Text>

<Review>It was the worst and last time I eat there. They served me a dried up shriveled hot dog covered nasty am/pm tasting chili . It wasn't any bigger than my pinky finger. It looked like they found it on the floor from the night before.  Highly recommend eat somewhere else.  Signed DAVID Clevenger  :(<//Review>< Gmap_id>

Tried this place twice and left there very disappointed.
Fist time was when they first opened.
The second time was on the spur of the moment.
Both time our food was Lukewarm and the Chili Dogs had less the "T-spoon of chili.
The Soda's had way too much ice.<//text>

As usual I usually go here for the shakes and not the food, if you're looking for a great burger joint look elsewhere, other than that they have great shakes and lots of drinks to choose from, can't go wrong with the ocean water drink here< /Text>

I go here often since its down the street from my job. On Friday I went and got a Texas cheeseburger and they didn't grow one side of the bread I always tell them I want my food hot and it was cold. I stopped off this morning and there weren't not very many people there and I waited in the drive thru for 10 mins and people in the drive thru got their food before I did and I was there before they they got there and still waited so I left with out my food. When you call and ask for a manager he acts like it's no big deal. Some guy there doesn't even let you finish order and tells you to pull up and your not even done he's done this twice to me. They need to be trained better on their customer service.<//text>

<date>1521798025464</date><Rate>5</Rate><Review>I love Sonic, their food, their master blast, cherry limeade is on point.
Just 2 problems:

1) Waffleberry brownie master blast to ME is disgusting, just too sweet and too much going on. Wasted money on getting the large like right at closing. So I took a couple bites and threw the rest away. But that's just me. Not the wasting food part, I hate to waste food.

2) need to bring back the cream slushes, PERMANENTLY, just saying.
Was pretty bummed.

Other than getting something new right at close and then hating it and not being able to do anything about it,
Sonic has always been a great experience. Can't think of a time where I didnt have a smile at Sonic.</Review><pics>None< /pics><resp>None</resp><GmapID>0x80dcb0cee2f42343:0xbacfff12064d7ffe</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<review>I have been to this Sonic's many times. The food is great and so is the service. The the hot dog and hamburger meals and all of the shakes and slushes are my most frequently bought items. It's a good place for quick drive-thru experience as well as car service dining.< /review>< name>

<review>Not a big fan of Sonic's food in general, but there's nothing that this location does wrong on that front. Food is fresh and hot. Service is a little slow at times, and the awkward drive-thru means you might get your food and then have to wait for the car in front of you to get theirs before you can pull out, but it's a minor annoyance.</review>< time>

I've tried to give them a chance multiple times with getting my order right and today was the last time. Got my order wrong so I went back and they got it wrong once again. Don't waste your time and just go to the Corona location.<//Text>

<text>This is a decent Sonic's location.  The food took a while to be served, but the food was good and as expected from a Sonic's.  The issue comes with the location itself, parking and local area.  There's a park right next door and a bus stop on the corner which leads to an increase of the homeless population.  One was coming up to the vehicles while they were in the drive-thru parking areas.  It seems like they're trying to keep it clean, but there is no staff or plan, it seems, to reduce panhandling.   If you're in the area maybe just go through the drive-thru area.</text><resp>None</resp></record>

I can't give this more than 3 stars. The burgers were unseasoned except for the condiments and the fries were undercooked. This was my first visit and I was unimpressed.<//Text>

We went for 1/2 price ice cream slushes and shakes and to try the pretzel hotdog. We arrived about 10 minutes early. 2 other groups came in  at the same time as us and one car was in the drive-in. It took 5 minutes for some one to come and help us. The cashier was very polite and patient. We received our order within 5 minutes. The hotdog was delicious and the slushes and shakes were yummy.</text>

<Review>I am super pleased with the service from Yazmine (I think that's how u spell it). I worked at a sonic so I know how it feels like to be super busy I did everything at that sonic from fountain to car hop. Miguel took our order and didn't hear me add a slushee but it was ok it's the cars fault behind us with some loud music. She was more than happy to get it for us ! And we also added a family sized fries and she apologized for the wait and brought us extra frie sauce. We bugged her like 3 times and not one time did she seemed bothered or agitated by us she was more than happy to help every time ! I love that customer service she had she always kept a happy face and was always on point with what she said or how she said it. Super pleased and once we are back in the area we will be coming back and I will let my friends know because the sonics near Anaheim where I live suck!!!!!! We will always be back thanks so Yazmines sweet heart ! :) We came July 13 2017< /Review>< Rate>

Decent food every now and again asked for one drink got another would not replace mistake drink for the one I asked for when ordering because of price differences, was asked to pay more because she didn't charge me the price for correct drink the first time if it was ur mistake you should fix it on your dime not mine< /Review>

Service SUCKS and there are no napkins or condiments in the dining area and if you want something you have to press the button and wait at least 5 mins for someone to come out. STAY AWAY FROM THIS SONIC!!!!!< /Review></record>
