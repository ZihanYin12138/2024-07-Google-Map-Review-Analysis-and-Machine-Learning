Love Mo and his family of mechanics! Mo even traveled to Watts to talk and present to my 8th graders about being a graduate from Berkeley and running a mechanics shop! He’s good people, people.< /Text>

<Review>This shop did the diagnosis for our vehicle emissions monitors not ready issue for a reasonable price.  However, the diagnosis is incorrect.  The shop recommended us to replace the catalytic converter and the front oxygen sensor for over $2300.  Today we took our car to a Toyota dealership for a second opinion.  The dealership made all emissions monitors ready without repairing or replacing any parts.  The tecician at the dealership only did a specific Toyota drive cycle for the car. We were only charged for $155, and the car passed the smog check afterwards.  I will not take my car to this shop again for any services no matter how price competitive this shop is.  I feel that this shop technicians don't have sufficient emissions knowledge and the owner treated us like his money tree.

I want every one to know that before I took my car to this shop, my car with only about 31,600 miles was running like a brand new car.  It did not have any Diagnostic Trouble Codes (DTCs), or any Malfunction Indicator Lights (MIL) on.  Besides, this car did not show any symptoms of a bad catalytic converter or a bad oxygen sensor.  It has been running very smoothly with very good fuel economy.  I just replaced the car's battery about two months ago.  Therefore, all the previous stored OBDII emissions data was lost due to the lost of power.  I tried to drive both city streets and the freeways at various speeds without knowing exactly what the car's CAT and O2S drive cycles are required.  I could not get the CAT and the O2S monitors ready for the smog check.  Therefore the Toyota dealership I went to did exactly what I couldn't do on my own and made these two monitors ready for me.  They did not know me and I did not know them.  They did not need to clear any codes for me because there were no codes needed to be cleared.  Once they did the specific drive cycle for me, the OBD computer automatically made these emissions monitors ready.  The Toyota dealer could have lied to me and recommended some repairs or replacement of parts, so that they could have made some money off me.  But they did not because this Toyota dealer has the integrity with sufficient technical knowledge and does not cheat on its customer.  In addition, my husband and I have driven for a long time and my husband used to be a master auto mechanic.  Lying to us is a huge insult to our intelligence and showed a great disrespect to us, both seniors and Asians.  I am very upset and disgusted by it.<//Review><pics>None</pics><response>{'time': 1617814609974, 'text': "Hi Rao, Thank you so much for your feedback. We are always striving to improve our company practices. It seems as though there was a misunderstanding. We followed our normal protocol for a failed smog check and began a diagnostic process. Upon completing the diagnostics we found that there are codes indicating replacement of two items in your vehicle. Of course, we could have cleared the codes and reset the car's computer to forget any codes as well. But that would be illegal and we would have lost our smog license. A smog check is scrutinized by the state of California for all visual and physical components. I am sorry we could not satisfy your request to pass the smog check in an unscrupulous manner and yes, indeed, we did recommend changing the parts. The car's computer will not forget the codes forever and you may be faced with replacing the parts recommended in the future. At which point, we would be happy to work with you and get your car in tip-top shape. We have competitive pricing and we offer a two year warranty, unlike the dealer. Take your time and come see us again!"}< /response>< GmapID>

< review>
I brought my car knowing that it needed work. All Tune and Lube was recommended to me by a family member and I will do the same for you. My car had an oil leak, power steering hose was cracked and my headlight module was broken. Not only did they inform me on what needed to be taken cared of first (which helped my budget) but they we also very friendly and honest, which is a quality that is difficult to find. They are fairly priced and they finish the job in a timely manner.

There is still minor work that needs to be done on my car but I know that they’ve earned my business for the foreseeable future. Fantastic work deserves a 5 star review! Thank you so much All Tune and Lube team for making my car fixing experience a positive one! Cheers!

(Update 12/2020: My car had a coolant leak and it needed an entire replacement; radiator, hoses, coolant tank the whole 9 yards. They took the time and fixed everything with no issues!)</review>

<text>These people stand behind their work and definitely take care of their customers! I had a bunch of work done a bit over a year ago and the same issue happened again recently due to a faulty part. Because they offer warranty for their labor and parts, they fixed it again NO CHARGE. They do what they can to make their customers happy and I would highly recommend going to them. They’re not trying to rip people off which is rare for a mechanic.< /text>< pics>

Another feel good experience with All Tune and Lube. Went in for an oil change and a leak. Found out the control arms and parts included were metal to metal. Not expecting such a big expense during these difficult times but Hamzah worked with us and we were able to have the services completed. This establishment is truly the best of the best.<//Text>

Salt of the earth professionals. Shop is friendly, reasonable, accommodating, upfront, very understanding and accountable for repairs...they work with you. All in all better service and experience than some of the mainstream repair shops in the area like Firestone, especially when it comes to check engine lights, major automobile repairs or heavier maintenance.

I have always come for repairs to All Tune and Lube and when they recognize a repair that might be under warranty with the dealer they send me there. The honesty is something that is so hard to find which is why I highly recommend All Tune and Lube. If you are in La Habra, Fullerton, Brea, La Mirada or Whittier it is worth the trip.</Review>< Date>

<review>Horrible ! Do they have negative stars? I drive a 2015 veloster, They told me I needed a full engine swap and me being not too familiar with automotive put my trust into them only to receive what look like something that came out of the junkyard got my car back with it coming up on the screen saying pull over when safe, safe mode enabled as if they didn't test drive it before giving it back to me and then told me that my computer will relearn itself after driving for 250 MI I spoke with the Hyundai technician who told me if any sort of TCM is swapped it must be programmed by Hyundai technician and/or have the tool to do so which this place does not have so I took it back after driving it 40 ft down the street and it driving completely horrible and unsafe and they put another engine in it. during that process I went to go get some stuff out of my car and they had the engine they just put in pulled out and the new one that they were putting in next to that one and it was night and day the first one was a rust bucket the second one looked somewhat decent still though did not program my computer told me it would fix itself my car's been sitting in my driveway for a year I've been back multiple times the warranty States 24 months 24,000 mi warranty I haven't driven over 500 MI since I've gotten the car back and they are saying that I'm way past warranty but my paperwork says otherwise so I will be taking them to court and the owner says he does not care because he has insurance that will cover it instead of just fixing my car this place is a joke< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1583001115816, 'text': 'Hi, Jacob\nWe thank you for writing your honest review about your experience. Every vendor such as a dealership or parts store has their individual warranty. Our general warranty is 24 months/24k miles. Unfortunately, with an engine replacement that costs almost $3k for the part itself then it cannot be covered under the general warranty. Our 6 month warranty was valid within 6 months of the second engine replacement. We are sorry that you could not take advantage of that warranty in the timeframe. If it was still the original time between repairs then we would have gladly did the work for free after a diagnosis confirmed the engine needed replacement.

My old Nissan Pathfinder 1997 did not pass the smog test even though all the recommended defective parts were all replaced with a new one. Our friend auto mechanic tried very hard to find what’s wrong and couldn’t find any. On my way along Imperial Highway I found this All tune & Lube automotive shop that do smog check and repair . I asked few questions and was happy with their answers. I was more confident that this shop will be honest and able to fix my car when I saw the sign of AAA recognition of the shop. I also learned several things  watching on the tv screen tips about cars and how to take care of  it while in the waiting area. I was even more happy finding out that I can get discount being an AAA member. My husband told his friend who also have a problem  on his car passing the smog test and asked for this’s shops address . I highly recommend this shop for their honesty and expertise. They’re always very busy but the staff and the owner that I met that day are very nice and accommodating. They even gave me and my husband some more tips about cars that I never experienced in the many auto shops that I’ve been to.<//Review>

Came in with no appointment and was greeted with a smile and total helpfulness. I had a check engine light that indicated a failed O2 sensor.  He had it done in 90 minutes at a surprisingly reasonable cost.  Barely had time for a breakfast down the street before I received the call that it was done.  I will come back for all my automotive repair needs.  Great to have a reliable and honest car repair resource that also does smog check.

Great place to go to repair your car very honest. You will be happy here. 3 years warranty almost everything they install Parts and LABOR. They will tell you over the phon or in person up front what kind of part they going to put in. They are open every day accept National Hollidays. 8 am to 6 pm Monday to Friday. Saturday and Sunday 9 am to 4 pm. Even they will wait for you if you will be late 30 to 45 min to close. You will go here with confidence that your job will be down properly. They do finance if you don’t have money to pay the accept all major cc, and they do accept Firestone and Goodyear credit card. They even have a Loner Car to offer if you car must be there for long. Wow I was there for couple of issue with my car. Very happy with them. You should try it too.< /Review>

Made an appointment for a smog. Smog tech refused to smog my car, saying I couldn't fit on the Dyno without it hitting the floor. Car is a full 5 inches off the ground. Smog was completed elsewhere successfully. Don't bother coming here if you have a car older than 2000. Tech doesn't want to get his knees dirty.< /review>

Just found this place online and printed the coupon and drove out to do errands then stopped by, parked and went inside, I was quickly greeted and asked what I needed.  I informed him I needed a regular smog test and he asked me to step into his office where he then asked for my Registration paperwork.  I pulled it out from my purse along with the coupon and presented it to him.  He took all the information and a technician came and took my key.  As I was signing, dating and filling in the time on the repair order, another customer walked in and I went to sit in the waiting area.  I glanced at the magazine selection and overheard him talking with the new customer, then the technician walked in and had my keys in his hand.  OH MY!  this does not look good.  I was finished, now way!  Way!  I had never had a smog test so fast in all my life.  I promptly paid, no checks, ATM is OK.  So I whipped out the old ATM and I was finished.  Handed my keys and out the door after thanking him and wishing him a Blessed Day!  Oh did I mention the total cost with the certificate filed with the DMV was $30.00.   So if you want wonderful treatment and fast service, as I was finished in less than 10 minutes, not to mention a great price (I could hardly believe it myself)  by all means come to ALL LUBE & TUNE on Imperial in La Habra.  It is on the north side of the street for those who have never been by there before, I drove from Whittier.  Amazing and well worth your time to go there as they truly respect your time.  Thanks All Tune & Lube for a wonderful experience getting my car smog tested.</text>

Improperly sealing axles are not a common occurrence and we wish it didn't happen at an inopportune time. With that said, we would like to give you a free oil change if you give us another try. Thank you."}< /response>< review>
1999 ford f250 super duty, 4x4 7.3 turbo diesel

I recently had the front axel seals replaced on the above listed vehicle on or about Nov 06, 2018 at ALL LUBE AND TUNE, 521 W. Imperial hwy, La Habra.    After having a disagreement with the cost, they performed the axel seal replacement.  I drove the truck home.  The next day I went to drive truck and noticed the front axels were again leaking and worse. I returned to the shop and explained the truck was leaking and worse.  They put the truck on the rack, looked at it and sprayed it with break cleaner.  The mechanic told me to take it to car wash and wash the axels.  I told the mechanic owner I was leaving to Arizona.  The owner said I would be ok.  On 11/29 or 30 I drove to Arizona, approx 290 miles.  Upon arrival I noticed the wheel wells and parts of the engine compartment covered with an oil substance.  I looked under the truck and found the axels severely leaking.  I went to a local shop and they put the truck on a rack  needless to say oil was dripping from the axels.  They repaired the truck and found the seals were not properly installed.  When I returned to ALL TUNE AND LUBE and explained that I got stuck and had to have the truck fixed, the owner said they would not reimburse me for the repairs.  He told me that I had to go through NAPA but was not provided any paperwork regarding warranty.
I found this shop through Repairpal, saw that they had a pretty good ratings, and saw where the worl is  guaranteed.  Needless to say I am extremely disappointed.< /review>

<text>My 2nd experience dealing with the shop, and they did a great job of diagnosing and repairing electrical problems with my 14 year old Honda Accord. The fee of diagnosis was applied to the repair...unlike a couple of other places which had a separate diagnosis fee. Additionally, I got my car smogged (best price I found in my local area) and an oil change during the same visit...so it saved me some time too.</text>< Pics>

< Review>
I decided to try this place out. I was in bad need of a mani& pedi. I called before going. I was in and out. I think the lady's name was Trina, can't remember.  She was very friendly  and took her time doing my nails. U didn't get anything special/extra. Price was very reasonable.</Review>

I went in for a gel pedicure and the lady messed up the polish so many times I was sitting there for so long. I got home and noticed how messed up the polish was that I had to remove it. I wish there was a way to get a refund.

After the pedicure I was supposed to get a manicure but the lady who was about to get started on my nails had dorito dust on her gloves and hands and wasn’t going to bother changing her gloves. If the gloves aren’t being switched out in between customers then I wonder what else is being reused like that. I left before she could even start. It was very unprofessional, a bad pedicure and unsanitary. Wouldn’t recommend anyone coming here.  This was on 3/16/2021<//text>

<text>Awesome! They salon was set up for safety and my nail technician was accommodating to my personal health needs and she did excellent work. It was my first time there and it is nowhere near my home but I will travel the long distance at any hour to back there again. I'm very happy with my experience.< /text><name>Iris Aparicio<//name>< UserId.>

Very fast service but my gel nail polish peeled off just minutes after getting home.  Host was not very welcoming and was yelling at the nail techs to hurry up. That was uncalled for and rude.< /Review>

I have been coming to this nail salon since they open so that has been many many years I have gone through so many different girls at this location, they do a very great job and like any other nail place they love to push to add more stuff so if you do go there just make sure you tell him exactly what you want because if not they will add extra here and there. I have never had a problem with this place and I always end up leaving happy the next time you're there or if it's your first time ever going to this nail salon then ask for Julie she is amazing she always does my pedicure and my full set and she's even great at waxing your eyebrows but I always call and make an appointment with her even though I show up and she's doing someone else's Nails I still have to wait a couple minutes or so and that's the only reason why I give them more stars because I never really keep an appointment but I'm always happy with the results and the prices are decent well sometimes.< /review>

I came into Rose Whittier Nails today for a manicure and the employees were very nice and attentive to my needs which was nice but I wasn't happy with the job the manicurist did with polishing my nails. The manicure itself was good but my nail color not so good. Color looks kinda lumpy. Not smooth. I got a black with alittle sparkle so it's not really noticeable so I left nails as is. Plus I didn't have time to sit and have nail color redone. If I had the time I would of had the lady do them again. Will I return? I'm not sure.</Text>

<rate>1</rate><review>I took my nieces who were visiting us for the holidays to treat them to a relaxing spa day. It turned out to be the most disappointing and saddest experience for me and them. My niece who is 13 knows 4 languages and understood every disturbing thing the technician was saying about her. My niece was so sad and just wanted to cry. She didn’t want to tell me because she didn’t want me to make a scene. What’s most shocking is that she was the owner who was working on her bails.my niece also used the google translation on some things she didn’t understand I highly recommend that. I’m using this now while getting my nails done and definitely not this salon .< /review>< pics>

<review>Ive been coming here for years! Today was my last time. Waited for more than 45m. They kept taking in other clients that had "appointments" which is not true no one had appointments.  I complained and still didnt get service

Update:
7/04/19
I only came because my sisters like coming here same thing happened. The owner kept taking in other customers. This time I waited for 1 hour and 40 minutes. Decided not to get anything done.
The owner just rolled her eyes at me and the second time I mentioned I was waiting she honestly just ignored me. Really rude.<//review><user>110983104691388948604< /user><rating>1</rating><gmapID>0x80c2d19136427a71:0x5315ff517062e4a6</gmapID></record>

Every time I get my nails done here, they last about a month (without having to fill or anything). They do an extremely good job. I recommend Julie and/or Tom.< /text>

Service and workmanship have declined. Since my last French tip pedicure visit in December the prices increased and the service and quality have declined. The basic pedicure no longer includes a mini lotion massage. Be on the look out for straight lines on the French tip, you may get screwed if you are not paying attention.

I was speaking with another patron while my second foot was being polished, so I did not notice the poor excuse of a French tip the worker (I choose not use pedicurist due to the lack of pride in workmanship) was passing off (lines were not close to being straight and a big glob of white protruding into what should have been the clear polish area). Had to go back upon home inspection. According to the worker, her poor workmanship was my fault for not noticing before I left. My fault? What ever happen to common since or pride in a job well done? Time to find another place.</text>

I've been here twice because I'm a local resident. Both times I have come out very unhappy. They skip steps to finish your nails fast so they don't end up looking pretty. To them time is money as the customer their not worth my money. I would not recommend this place to anybody.< /Text>

I used to come here all the time since my mother brought me over as a child.  But ever since the owner accused me of trying to rob her over a nail tool she sold me and I tired to return it no later then 2 minutes. It was old and broken,  and I wanted a better one or my money back.  She insisted that she would never sell such a thing, she started to say I was trying to rob her by replacing it with an old used one.  I got so mad,  because I've been coming here for years,  and to be told something I would never do freaking pissed me off. She finally gave me money when I stated to raise my voice in anger and she didn't want others to see what she started.

I also stop coming here because they techs refuse to not use the drill bits, and not a file as requested. I already have thin nails and they insist on using it,  which then just makes my nails in pain.   I know how to do nails,  but I come here so I can give myself a break from don't nails,  so I don't like being played stupid.  I started going to the salon down the street from them which has a much better customer service and quality work.< /Text>

I recently purchased a home across the street from this place, so I figured I’d give this place a try.  I have been here for a couple of times and the service was just okay. Well I stopped by June 21st for a pedicure, gel manicure and underarm wax.

Well let me tell you my skin if fair and now my underarms are dark and have black and red spots.
This place gave me a fungal infection that I have not been able to get rid of for the past month.

Please ladies pay a little bit more and get services at a clean and professional.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None<//resp>< GmapID>

I GOT FUNGUS‼️This place is horrible !!! I've been coming for a years now and recently I've started getting my nails done with a manicurist by the name of tom , omg !!it's been a horrible experience ! He cuts down so deep into the nail bed and uses dirty tools ! I've gotten a serious nail fungal infection from him not sterilizing tools . I noticed a woman with discolored nails prior to him working on me!! I've devastated now , I'm so embarrassed to show my hands . My life is ruined !!! I'm never coming back . This place spreads fungus . Please beware . Leaves fingers in pain 🤢I tried to add pics ,but of course I couldnt 🤔😒< /review>

Awesome
Big thanks to the family that's does this.
Amazing, visuals, beautiful work you have done here.
My child got scared towards the end, weary well done and layed out.
I went saturday for my first time and Sunday (today) for the second time, they accept donations and do beautiful things for the community and charity.

What an amazing local haunt! First time here tonight and it will not be the last time this season or years to come! Really cool prop and costume design throughout and even surpasses the big theme parks in terms of scares and quality!< /review>

<Text>No Halloween is complete without a visit to this eclectic home haunt. I won't tell you what awaits you, but it's quite a maze crammed into a backyard. Kudos to these home owners for entertaining the neighborhood and families during Halloween. I appreciate their hard work and keeping the spirit of Halloween alive. I would def recommend this free home haunt to anyone.< /Text>< user>

<Review>Great little free maze in Burbank!
It Rivals the set designs of Reign of Terror and Hollywood Horror Nights! It's about a 10-minute walk through but totally worth it there's a donation box at the end. You can tell a lot of creativity and love was put into this!<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None< /resp>< gmapID>

Awesome! Free! Scary! An amazing amount of work and detail has been put on display for everyone to wonder. It is as if I walked into a maze I would find at an amusement park. I was impressed! There were literally wall to wall chills. I do not recommend for small children or those who easily scare as the participants do jump out and feed on your fear!</Text>

A Burbank tradition. Surprisingly creative and fun, themed walk-through never disappoints. It's quality is on par with any of the paid theme parks displays. Free. Zero cost. Give a donation if you can.<//review>

I would say this in on par with some of the mazes you'll find around LA, but this one is free! Check it out! If you can, leave a donation in the box. This family is kind enough to host this event for free, but giving them a few bucks doesn't hurt.</Review>< pics>

< Review>
I was impressed by the large selection of various beer types. Menu had kind of scarce variety of offerings but the food was so fresh and tasted amazing!! Staff was helpful, friendly, and attentive. They do not do taster flights but will do half pours of most beers. I had the Classic Haze (hefeweizen) and the In Lieu of Flowers (stout). Both delicious beers. Had a flatbread with goat cheese, roasted beets, pistachios, and arugula. The vinegerette on the top was the perfect addition (server told me it was made in house). Goat cheese dip was also very tasty.</Review>

This is the perfect place for a Sunday compromise between my friend and I. He gets to go to a great brewery with plenty of TVs to watch the game and I get to go to a very cute brunch with gorgeous decor and awesome food. We ordered a couple flights of beer and the bahn mi sandwich.< /text>

Beautiful morning to sit at a table on the sidewalk and enjoy a drink and breakfast. Pork Belly - Savory, sweet and a bit of bitter... absolutely delicious! Blueberry Cornbread - Crunchy, creamy and a bit juicy...and Hard Lemon Kombucha. One of the best breakfasts I have had in a long time. Thank you!<//review>

Really love all that they do here.  I feel safe eating and drinking here during the pandemic, since they have outside dining, a large open room, safe distance between tables and lot's of hand sanitizers available.  Beer is exceptional + good variety and food is super solid.  Wait staff is always on their game, check them out!  Wear your masks!</Text>

<text>Best beer and service of north park.

The beer is really good and features a good variety, not just hazies. Also, the service is really the best of the area. I’d highly recommend visiting. I’ll be there often! :)<//text>< pics>

<Text>This place far exceeded my expectations. The food is legitimately some of the best brewery food I've had.  It's not typical pub food and it's not super cheap, but it's definitely worth it. Get the mussels and adobo ribs (around $15 each) and you'll understand. The service was also super accommodating and friendly, and even on a busy Thursday night, our group of 6 found a table quickly.< /Text><GmapID>0x80d955a6fd07c827:0x14dd3a548bd64f86</GmapID>< time>

Super chill spot to grab beer. The staff was super friendly and attentive. The beer was delicious on top. Make sure to try their imperial desert stouts if they are on tap. They are like drinking a pie that was converted into a beer.</review>

Wow!  What a great place....staff is AMAZING. Can't speak highly enough of how they were all friendly, helpful to customers and knowledgeable about the beer.  Food was good and beer is fresh and refreshing.  Our group drank most of the beer offered throughout the course of a late happy hour into the evening. They are dog friendly and have a great mix of indoor and outdoor seating space.  It isn't huge, but the 2 indoor/outdoor bars are a very nice touch and great use of space. Will definitely be back.<//Text>

What a great place!! They have so many drink options, guest taps, they ever been their own seltzer’s and the watermelon is delicious. The inside is spacious with different types of tables to hang out, and they have a small outdoor patio in the back. The servers and beer tenders were great and recommending and let us taste whatever we wanted, friendly and helpful staff for sure</review>

<Text>It's a really chill little brewery. The beers selection was interesting with drinks like So Berry sour and Not a Whale IPA. Expect to spend $6-8 on a beer and if you're getting food about $8-14. The staff were all very courtesous and very engaging. Of course at this time masks are required at all times when you are not seated at your table.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

I don't like any of their beers. The papas bravas is disgusting. the potatoes were barely cooked and almost cold, they said that's the way they come. When I exchanged it took over an hour to get my replacement. I did like the olives on a separate visit.<//Review>

We were going next door for brunch but didn't want to wait 40 min, so we decided to try it.  It was a pleasant surprise,  food was good, servers were attentive & didn't have to wait.   Eggs & fries could've used a bit of salt, but otherwise BLT w/avocado, croque madame & blueberry cornbread were very tasty.  Would definitely go back< /Review>

Lots of white, lots of wood, lots of copper. I love the decor. It's like you're in a botanical garden. Not enough sound baffling. Hang some egg-crates from the ceiling so I can try to have a conversation, please! The beer is pretty good. Too many IPAs and only one house heff, pale, Mexican style, et cetera. Like ten IPAs. Food is very good, but limited. Only one burger, one fish dish, one steak, two salads. And this fish plate ain't much for the better part of twenty dollars. I really loved the corn ravioli. Great bathrooms.< /Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNIA1qS3-htbcNn6QUoolFD69ISuKuAUQfKd2aK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMF61KGup0lO_Fqa6PPqrSQC_lz_KYUzcoL6-m0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures>< Resp>

Nice to have a brewery in North Park where the food comes first.  Been there a few times just to eat. The ribs, mussels, salads and salmon are all top notch.  Cheers to the ownership for bringing in a real chef and creating a small but thoughtful menu.<//review>

Awesome place to hangout and drink and eat.  Not your typical brewery interior.  This place is gorgeous and light and warm.  I'm more of a food guy than a beer guy.  Try the mussels and the ribs.  Both may be the best in town of each.  The burger is solid too.  As for the beer, my friends raved about the Pilsner, so I'd give that a try.  Honestly one of the best new places to hangout for an afternoon or evening.< /Review>

This place really hit the ground running.  The decor is warm, clean, and inviting.  The service is well-trained and friendly.  And, most importantly, the beer is really on point.  I especially enjoyed the Feeling Safe (IPA), Schlock Purist (pilsner), and the Know Practice (dry stout).  Original 40 is a great addition to the North Park beer scene.  Like if you agree!</text>

<text>I went to the Original 40 Brewing Company this weekend and had a great time. The Juicy Maze and Feeling Safe IPA’s which were both great and would highly recommend. I ate the Patou’s Summer Salad and grilled shrimp both dishes were so flavorful. The Ambience is amazing I did not want to leave. The owners came by our table and could not have been nicer people! Great addition to North Park!</text>< pictures>

Steve & Patricia are great, and their vision for a bright welcoming brewery with great food is a welcome addition to North Park. They put a lot of care into the details.
Chris brews delicious beers. The Pilsner is my favorite, and the Blonde is also very tasty. You gotta try the Brown!<//text>

<Rate>5</Rate><Text>Beautiful spot with great beer and great food. I think what sets this place a part from the rest of the breweries in North Park is the next-level food they put out. We went this last Saturday night and got a table for four of us along the wall. Service was attentive and we had some really amazing food including a fresher-than-fresh beet salad, crispy green beans, shrimp, and some gougeres that were filled with the tastiest beer cheese I've ever had. Also, get the adobo ribs! They are fall off the bone tender and such a bright and savory flavor with the soy and vinegar flavors. Finally the steak with chimichurri was also excellent. We also had the Juice Maze IPA, another IPA that I'm forgetting the name of now and the pilsner that were all really well done. If another brewery is going to open in North Park, these guys did it right; high-quality beer and outstanding food. We can't wait to go back!<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

They claim to be dog friendly. They kicked me and my service dog out and I got laughed at in the process. Let me remind you, not every person with a service dog has a visible disability. Felt very discriminated. Not a good look.<//text>

< review>
I have been living here for about 2 years and I do not have any sorts of problems with this apartment besides one thing. The bottom of the doors leading outside have a small slit underneath where small critters can crawl through. I thought it was only a problem with my apartment door, but apparently other people have been experiencing this as well. These roaches come in all sizes and are freaky and scary. The staff and neighbors are nice and friendly and I have never had a problem with them. The apartments are large and spacious, but mine did not come with a plug for where the washer machine and dryer goes, so we have to hand wash, or go to places to wash them. Whenever we have a complaint, we head to the office and it is usually is fixed in less than 5 days. The neighbors and staffs are very friendly and they wave and smile to me all the time. My stuff has never been tampered with by others and this neighborhood is overall well. My only complaint are the roaches.< /review>

<text>I have a relative that has lived here. Sadly, there is a high turnover of management and the current management doesn't know how to do their job well. They send  manager notices for bills over a year old due to audit concerns. The prior manager did help where she could. The housekeeping isn't up to standard. The laundry room has leaks constantly, there are large what they call waterbugs, I call cockroaches everywhere. Expect to get pest control notices often. But the pests are still there. The stove has caught fire. There's a graveyard of appliances next to the laundry room. The security gates are not secure. And the maintenance can't seem to handle leaks. The best thing is the unit sizes are decent. Qualified management might turn things around.<//text>< Pictures>

Don't even bother putting an application and paying the fees because they pick and choose who they want to rent to. There are NO standards anymore. The woman in the office,  I believe she is the assistant manager, was extremely rude. First of all, she was chewing her food very loudly on the phone when she answered. Second of all, she told my friend he didn't need income/credit requirements to move in if he wanted to just pay her a "cash commission." So I called to see what that deal was about and of course she acted like she didn't know what I was talking about. So I will be calling corporate in the morning to see if that's how they are really running their business now. It seems like every place in Sacramento is shady now.</text><Name>Maria Ma< /Name>< Date>

<Review>With low income housing you expect to have a wide demographic. With that being said, the majority of people here are black. Now I am a mixed single mother who never goes looking for trouble seeing as I have an infant to protect and provide for. If you keep your head low it's not all that bad, but slip up and try to make "friends" and now your stuck in some high school drama meets real life bs.  I've overheard conversations from the children in the area and it's not an environment I would want my daughter to grow up in as she gets older and can understand what's going on around her. When housing is absolutely needed I say yes, move here but as soon as you can get out, RUN!<//Review>< response>

I brought the car back a month later, and yes it was a little dirty but it had a parking permit. 2 hrs later, i got a note that my car will be towed if i do not remove it. Talked to the staff and they said whoever security authorized it, they will fix it. But it was not fixed. And the reason why it got towed was that it was not operative and parked there for more than 72 hrs. My mom drives that car everyday! Not only did it happened once, but twice during the same month. Very upset with the staff and security.<//review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

If i can rate a zero star rating , i would. Management don't know how to manage, you ask them to come fix something and they never come unless inspections are happening. Stove have been broken for the longest. Backyard light haven't been working since My family move in about 3 years ago, our porch light broke and they haven't fix it, yes I did notify them but they seem to never have time. Mailboxes will be broken into. Cars will be tow in the middle of the night and when you question the office, they state that it's not their fault but the "securities's fault". When they do tow your car, they don't even leave a note for you or anything.</review>

Terrible place if you have kids don't live here they will get in fights and tons of drama. Kids vandalize, they throw rocks at cars and windows(along with eggs).I would also not bring pets, if you love them very much ...they poison the grass and one of my neighbors ran my dog over on purpose.. He speeded up to make sure it would be fatal... Really any kid will chase ur dog or cat with sharpened sticks like its the stone age.<//review>

<text>Multiple supplies for a wide variety of animals. All the way from Horses to Guinea pigs. It's an old school feed store and its a refreshing place to go for a look. Its definitely not a Petco, which is what makes the Feed Barn such a unique and fun place to shop. Plus their prices are more then fair, some items are cheaper then Amazon.<//text><response>None</response>< Pics>

Love this feed store. It is not just livestock material, but food for all sorts of animals, too. They have food for everything from dogs and cats to birds and rabbits.

I just bought sunflower seeds, in shell peanuts and mixed nuts to make my own squirrel food. I like that they have both pre-made bags and self-serve, which made it very easy for me. And the price is very reasonable.

They are also friendly, knowledgeable and helpful. I highly recommend them.</text>

I went there to buy food grade Diatomaceous earth at a great price! This stuff is only the best thing created by nature to completely remove all odors caused by pets from your carpet! Gets rid of mold and mildew odors, too! It's a powerhouse all-in-one.....Antibacterial, Antimicrobial, Antiviral and Antifungal. It's a great body cleanse, drink to detoxify your entire body.</Review>

Went there to get flea medicine for dogs. There's a PetSmart across the street but I prefer to support local business even if it's sometimes a little more expensive than chain stores. I asked to use the bathroom and some scruffy guy that works there said "it's not for customers." I turned right around went back to my car and took my business to PetSmart, because they have a bathroom for "customers," and their price is more competitive. So whatever. Good luck to you guys.< /Review>

The place was pretty small but it had a decent enough spot to dance. I imagine this place being a lot more wild in the later parts of the evening.</Review></record>

<Review>Super fun place to hang. It's not big and it's a cash bar only but the drinks are stiff and the crowd was fun. The DJ was spinning a mix if top 40's, 90's, and 2000's hits. There is a small outside area if you want a quieter area to sit and lounge. $5 cover after I think I was 10pm.</Review>< rating>

Great little spot. Staff is a bit overwhelmed but extremely courteous. They deserve big tips! Polk Punch is a bargain drink that is tasty and will punch you out quite quickly if you aren't careful.</Review>

<Review>One of my favorite spots to go dancing in the city. They consistently play great music.

Not particularly great bartenders though. I had to wait about 20 minutes before I got a beer. They used to have better bartenders, but the new ones seem like they'd rather be elsewhere. I mean, I understand that bartending is not easy at all, with all the drunk people doing drunk things all around, but that isn't an excuse for always looking like you are working somewhere you don't wanna be working at all.
They also don't do the jello shots anymore, which kinda sucks. But I guess you can't have it all.
And if you hate the smell of smoke, the smoke room is connected to the dance floor, which could make for unexpected wafts of smoke filled air to rush in every time someone opens the door.<//Review>< resp>

I have never waited so long for a drink. The bartenders make sure to serve certain types of people before others. Also, they only accept cash even though it is the year 2015, in the technology capital of the world. It is also tiny, and they made my friend get back in line when he stepped outside to smoke...what was the point of stamping our wrists then? The bouncer snapped at my date when she asked if my friend could come back in to use the bathroom. I am giving this 2 stars instead of 1, simply because they had a decent DJ on this particular occasion.< /text>

My first experience at Vertigo wasn't a good one, but Polk Street bars tend to be a nightmare on the weekend and I can't really hold that against the bars. During happy hour this is a chill spot with good prices on the tap beer. $3 for a Laganitas is pretty nice, and there's plenty of room to sit at the bar or in a booth.</review>

The guy at the door is rude. I've been there before but I've never seen him. My friends and  I were out to celebrate. Unfortunately I lost my id. I had a picture of my old id, the temp form from dmv, and my credit and he wouldn't let me in and said it could be fake and accused me of trying sneak my way in. I could care less about that empty bar, we were just bar hopping. I can't accuse him of being racist, but the way he treated me/us definitely didn't feel right.< /text>

DON'T COME! Lack of Bartenders and they're slow. Waited for 30mins to get a cocktail. Racists. Not first come first service. Race first.< /text>

<rating>1</rating><review>Bartender, security, and even customers in this place are racist af.
Bartender charged me $14 for a double Rum and Coke and told me they only accept a card with a minimum of $25 charge.
After all this, the bartender hid my card, kept saying he did not receive the card and the security forced me out of the bar for no reason.
I called 911 and bartender returned my card with a check of $7.</review>< pics>

<user>117531431255744767531</user><text>Great place for a walk. OK for bringing a dog along if you have a leash since there is no gate and it's close to HWY 18 you want to keep them on a leash here, unless they're well trained. Also I usually see a Porta-Potty to use the restroom and some fountains.
I personally like to walk up the path to the water tower.< /text></record></dataset><record>

<text>This is a nice big open grassy area to have a picnic, and hang out with family and friends. Not too much seating or benches so if you're going to have more than a few people, bring your folding table and chairs.
This is also a great place to host events because of the vast open space. The town has a huge community yard sale here each year that you can take part in or just come and shop. It's a nice well kept purposeful park.<//text>< Pictures>

Great walking place, not too much for kids. Watch out for the people hanging out. We had a scary situation with the youngest a couple of weeks ago.<//Review>

We like this park because there's a large enough grassy area there's a baseball area. The kids play baseball there's some areas for hiking and lots of rabbits for my dog to chase so if she's a happy girl I'm a happy girl thank you and enjoy<//text>

I love this place for walking.  The two hills, one to the water towers and the other to an abandoned house, are great for a solid hard workout. Once you get to the top the view is breathtaking!</Review>

<Text>Nice mellow place to walk your dogs and hike with family. I use to go here all the time before it became widely know as it is today and was able to walk my dogs off leash but now it seems like a bunch of older people who has nothing better to do than complain comes here so I can't off leash walk as freely as I use to. But if you see 4 German shepherds chasing rabbits that's me and all my dogs are pet and family safe.<//Text>< userid>

I really like this park, there's a track and I usually start my hike to the Hill top house from Lions. It's a great place to go with my dogs but unfortunately a lot of people take their dogs without leashes. It's disappointing but hey it's a people problem.</text>

It's a small Park with really nothing there. I didn't even see a bathroom. There are some shade trees so it would be a nice place for a picnic and they do have some picnic tables there although I didn't see any grills. I was there for an event and that's the only time I've ever been there are for events.< /Text>

This park is great for dogs. There isn't any play equipment for kids however there is a large grass area, drinking fountains,  and plenty of parking (dirt). A lot of people use this park and the immediate surrounding area for exercise/running/ walking/ hiking. This park provides great views and the people are friendly.<//text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

Very small park out in the middle of a lot of dirt. Tons of parking (unmarked) and surprisingly there isn't a lot of people here so it's a nice little place. For people coming from the city (Los Angeles), it's a small patch of grass - very small surrounded by lots of dirt. We like to park our cars here if we go walk up to the hillhouse (great exercise).<//text>

A spacious no frills dog park with beautiful views of San Francisco and the port of Oakland. Be aware the park can become very muddy after a heavy rain.</Review>

<user>103923938970842754258<//user><review>Great large, spacious park!  We normally take our puppy here in the day and allow him to run his heart out.  He likes to play with other puppies but frankly just loves to big open area to roam, play and run with.  With the perspective of lights of the bay bridge and SF skyline, it is almost magical.<//review>< GmapID>

<review>Great big, huge park! We generally take our pup here in the evening and let him run his heart out. He loves to play with other dogs but honestly just loves to large ooen space to roam, run and play. With the view of lights of the bay bridge and SF skyline it's almost magical.
Only down side would be the size. If your dog isn't obedient to voice commands then beware that this may not be the park for you as there's a lot of ground to cover is something breaks off with another dog(s).</review>< username>

This is our go to Alameda dog park.  Most dog owners are attentive to their dogs and friendly. When we go,  I don't see the dog walkers coming in with multiple dogs,  such as Washington Park.  I respect dog walkers,  but have seen some that have too many dogs and cannot watch them all properly.</text>

<Text>Very muddy with large puddles, but break more grass than other parks. Don't be surprised if there's no parking during the week as the ferry parking seems to have taken up all the dog park parking. It's an ok park, I just wish there was more space, more grass they'd fill in the puddles, and plant some trees.</Text>< rating>

I found it odd that not a lot of people were there at the dog park considering it has all the signs of a great dog park : its clean, double fenced, has water and water bowls, lot of parking, a bench for dog owners to sit on and plenty of space for dogs to run around. Not sure if many dog owners know of this place.

This isn't the prettiest or nicest dog park, but it tends to be quiet with only few dogs at a time. I like the fact that people that comes here tend to be more about the dogs and not the dog park social scene.< /review>

Been going to Scotty's for years now. Finally, mechanics you can trust! Always gotten quality service at a fair price. The last visit they passed with flying colors. I took my just purchased '97 F150 in for a complete check-up. I asked them to tell me everything it needed. Happily, they said the shocks, coolant, transmission fluid, brake fluid were fine. You know you have an honest mechanic when they don't try to sell you shocks.</Text>

We don’t do any work that is not authorized by our clients, therefore we did have your approval on services and price before we started working on your vehicle, if you were unhappy with those you are able to decline service. We explained that we have suppliers we get our parts through and parts that are found online are not warrantied for us, so we do not install those. We also spent a decent amount of time on your vehicle in addition to the repairs we made as we checked all of your tune parts, checked your timing for a failed smog, cleaned and checked for your oil leak, marked your crankshaft pulley so you can pass smog, and checked all of your belts, hoses, and fluids. Again we are sorry to see that you are disappointed, but feel that we were upfront and honest with you about both the service and pricing you would be receiving.'}<//Response><rate>1< /rate><Review>Absolutely the WORST shop to take your vehicle to, unless you enjoy paying 4x the cost for your parts. A part that was verified costing $75.00 from one of their suppliers, they charged $300.00, and then charged $400 for labor to remove two bolts, insert the part, and then put the two bolts back on. I verified all of this with the mechanic after I asked them to walk me through their repair. So, overall a job that took them maybe 20 mins and cost $75, they charged $700.00. It’s blatant robbery and UNETHICAL.< /Review><UserId.>106234152569145333956</UserId.>< gmap_id>

Their service is top notch. I went in to have my civic looked at because for whatever reason, it wasn't passing smog test. They took it overnight and the following morning called back, fixed the problem, and just like that my car was ready to be picked up! I highly recommend this place.</Review>

I came to Scotty's after a friend recommended that I have an issue with car checked by Scotty's as a second opinion after the dealership tried to lie to me and charge me over $1,000. After that visit to Scotty's (which proved the lie by the dealership, and only $124 repair) I have consistently taken ALL of my vehicles to them. They track and provide excellent service to their customers, with extremely reasonable rates that do not gouge you.
One downside is their closure on weekends, but the staff are more than friendly and are willing to work with you on your schedule limitations to ensure that you get your car serviced or taken care of by them.
Scotty's is that diamond in the rough when it comes to being fair, honest, and up front with customers with their vehicles.< /text>

Thought for sure we had broken engine mounts and an expensive repair bill coming.  Scotty's did  some engine work and the vibration is gone, all for under $200.  Anywhere else would have got us for new engine mounts!  Scotty's may be the last honest mechanic - give them a try!!!< /text>

<review>I'm a reformed DIYer with my cars. I have trust issues with mechanics - it's my families safety on the line. I've been in to Scotty's multiple times now, with more than one vehicle. The guys here are exactly who you want working on your cars - and by extension ensuring your families safety. They're honest about what they find and what you need. The work they do is top notch. They're fast. And to top it off their rates are affordable. I've also recommended Scotty's to friends and family and they've all had the same experience. An easy 5 stars - I'd give them 6 if I could.<//review></record>

<review>I went to Goodyear for my check engine light and was told it was a power steering leak but when I took it in to Scottys it turns out I had a major oil leak and I needed a new oil sensor. Thanks to Scottys my car is running like new again and they were so nice enough to power wash my Undercarriage of my car since the oil went everywhere. They were so nice not to try to wash it off for me which was really nice though. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who has a car problem. They don’t mess around and they don’t try to sell your parts that you don’t need for your car. They get straight to the point and work on it. I’ve been going to them for the longest time and I’m so thankful I did. Thank you so much Scottys!!!!!!<//review><name>Mercedes Faulkner</name>< Resp>

They went above and beyond to help make sure my car would pass the specialized requirements for DMV to get my salvage title on a fender bender accident I had. Although they are not certified for this DMV certification they checked my car to assure me it would pass this inspection. Once you take your car to these  DMV contracted shops and they say something is wrong additional fees could be added that only these shops can fix. I trusted Scott's would tell the truth since they have been maintaining my car. I pays to find an auto shop you can trust like Scotty's.  By the way the specialized shop that did the DMV inspection agreed that Scotty's is a good auto shop. Thanks Scotty's!!< /review>

They were very honest with me, gave me a couple repair invoices and told me it wasn't anything urgent that needed to be taken care of but to eventually have done. They also told me my car was in great condition for being 12 years old. So I kept it and am now getting ready to take back there for any fixings.

I was back there today and ran into the same guy that helped me 2 years ago. His name  is Tom,  and he is super helpful and super honest! I told them before I left today that I will always be bringing my business to them. There is a closer location to me, but when you find a good, friendly, and trustworthy place, it's worth the extra few miles drive.

I hope everyone else gets the same great service I have recieved! Thank you!!<//review>< gmapID>

Great business! I have used them frequently over the past few years and have been well taken care of each time. They are professional, efficient, and will always take care of your vehicle in a timely fashion. They are always very upfront about the costs. I really trust Scotty's Automotive. Highly recommended!< /Review>

The number one issue with mechanics is honesty right?

This is the shop for honest service. I teust them completely and that is an enormous weight off my shoulders when it comes to our vehicles.

Seriously. Drive however far you have to in order to use Scotty's. They're worth it.<//text>

<Review>These guys go above and beyond when it comes to their work and their customer service.  Competitively priced and well worth every penny.  So grateful to have done the research so many years ago, which is how I ended up here.  Tom is always a fountain of knowledge, I never feel like I don’t know what is wrong and what has to be done to fix it.  The raport amongst every employee is like family, so nice to see/hear.  I believe that Kevin worked on my car today and it is like new!  Minus all of the garbage laying around from two small children ;)  HIGHLY RECOMMEND Scotty’s Automotive.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>{'time': 1531319541635, 'text': 'Ana, thank you for trusting us with your automotive repairs!

Highly recommend this place. I am a RN. I have dealt with some great mechanics, good mechanics, and some sleezy ones too. These guys truly stand behind their work and are honest fair and trustworthy. They are my go-to for all of my vehicles now, and I would whole-heartedly recommend them to anyone needing service of their vehicle. If only, they did alignments too, I wouldn't go anywhere else. I was neither paid, encouraged, nor requested to make this recommendation, and I stand by my word too.</Text>

These guys were awesome. They took me the same morning I called. I had a MAF sensor issue and they quickly diagnosed that my new part was faulty by running some tests. Using a new part they showed me statistics on what was wrong. I ran back to autozone and got my part replaced (because they sold me a faulty sensor), went back to Scotty’s, and they put the new part in. Scotty’s ran tests on the new part for me to ensure it was good. I was hesitant to try a local shop being new to the area, but these guys are a top caliber business! Highly recommend!</text>

We have been coming here for years. We love the staff and cleanliness of the office. My only complaint is during Covid I felt the waiting room was a little full. Once we got to the back everything was great. We must have hit a rush but I was a little uncomfortable with the amount of people in the waiting room at one time.<//text>

They're the best kids dentist around! Always so awesome with the kids and parents!

Cant say enough positive things about lollipop dental. They are so sweet with the kids and know exactly how to make them comfortable. The office is so clean and kid decorated. My daughter just had a cavity filled and the doctor was amazing with her and helping her get rid of her "pink and blue and brown sugar bugs"as she refered to them :)</text>

I had a really bad experience with my sons old dentist office & was scared to try new places due to pandemic matters . So a family member told me about her experience at Lollipop and I took the chance & I am VERY Glad I did  !! They totally changed my sons view on going to the dentist. He is 7 and he loved his experience. As a parent I am happy because the staff was very helpful and kind. The dental assistant was so kind and made my son comfortable. All my questions were answered and they were not annoyed by many questions they kept very professional. The Dr was AMAZING . What I loved most about her is she tells you what is needed but she isn’t pushy like other places that just want your money. She actually gave me alternatives and it worked out just well! I am definitely going to keep them for as long as I can ! I highly recommend them ***** five stars all the way<//Review><date>1597979652181</date></record></dataset><record>

<Review>I’ve taken both of my kids to Lollipop for years and continue to be impressed with the experience. Great atmosphere for kids and the techs and dentists are thorough and definitely kid-friendly. I was a bit nervous to take them during Covid, but their safety practices put me at ease. Plus - the kids love the little toys at the end and the sugar free lollipop!<//Review>< username>

I brought my daughter here years ago after a bad experience at another dentist left her traumatized. I cannot say enough about the staff, always friendly, helpful and patient. They never force the children to do anything they don’t want to do and are always so kind. Their work is always top notch and the kids always leave with a small toy, toothbrush/toothpaste goodie bag and of course the lollipops that are not harmful for their teeth. Would highly recommend to all my family and friends.<//Text>

Great experience overall! Our 5 year old had some cavities filled in and the whole process was smooth. Everybody from the front office staff, dental assistants, and dentists were very helpful and kept us informed throughout the entire process. We definitely recommend Lollipop! 😊👍< /review>

I have a very sensitive 7 year old. Lollipop dental removed 3 baby teeth on him and he did amazing! I was surprised by how quick and seamless the dentist was. He was definitely very nervous, but the experience was very fast, and he healed beautifully. I was so worried about him going in, I bribed him with $$ per tooth, but now I wish I hadn’t bc lollipop did such a great job!</Text>

Can’t say enough good things about Lollipop. Taking kids to the dentist can be a tough time, but from the time you are greeted until the end of your appointment everyone is so friendly and accommodating. They make it actually FUN to go to the dentist! Will only take my kids here.< /Review>

I was referred here by a friend after having a horrible experience with another pediatric dentist. From the minute I called the entire experience with Lollipop was different and quiet frankly amazing. The front office desk was prompt , responsive , and ran my daughters insurance over the phone. They then sent all the paperwork through email for me to fill out - quick and easy. My daughter was in tears for this visit ( due to her previous experience at another dentist ) walking through the door. We warmly greeted and the atmosphere was fun and relaxing, great for kids - balloons , toys for after the visit , music playing - the whole nine yards. The dental assistant was SO kind and gentle with my daughter from start to finish . She even got my daughter to pinky promise with her that this visit with the dentist was going to be okay !!!! Pinky promise you guys ! Dr Judy was knowledgeable and so kind as well. I am beyond grateful for this referral and will be referring anyone who listens !!! Thank you ladies at Lollipop dental - you all were amazing !!</text>

Dr. Pham is great, but we haven’t seen here there in quite some time.  Services seem to be slipping without her around.

We are also being charged hefty copays now, despite having the same dental insurance.

Also, they have demanded a review from me 4 times, twice just today.  I don’t like spam, and I especially hate it when I pay the spammer so they can spam me.

Also, they have been in the habit of scheduling us for things.  That is, things we didn’t schedule are just scheduled for us.  They also didn’t tell us where in the building the appointment was, so we were late and they almost couldn’t see us.  They bill you if you don’t show up, likely if you show up too late to be seen too.  Seems scammy to me.<//text>

The staff is friendly and very informative.  Dr. Judy took her time to examine and speak with me regarding the concerns I had with my children's dental health.

I would recommend this facility and their staff to all my friends and family.<//review>< Gmap_id>

If I could give them 10 stars I would! They are amazing with my kids. My son would give me the worst time going to the dentist.. he would be that kid that would be screaming.. but when my best friend told me about this place, that all changed! They were super patient with him and made him feel comfortable. They made the whole experience fun. I have not gone to any other dentist since we found this place. The staff is amazing and the place is always super clean. I wish they accepted adults!! 😜</text>

We love coming here just recently we had a HUGE ISSUE and not receiving a call back after leaving now 5 voicemails. Now the calls are transferred to a call center and still another voicemail and no call back. Even for an emergency no one calls you back. Were paying for my daughters appliances that wont stay in and even though I've made it an emergency voicemail to have the appliance replaced no one calls back. We are wasting our money! Very frustrating!< /text>

<Text>Great team friendly, so far from it being my daughter second visit being the best visits ever. Daughter felt comfortable and actually enjoy going to the dentist that’s a first. And I will be bring my other 2 toddler as well for visits coming up and I just know they will love it. Highly recommended to all parents with kids this would be the best place for your child to go. If I could give 10 stars I would because that’s what this dentist deserves. Thank you 😊</Text>< Pictures>

Amazing, Amazing Dental Practice for Kids! My kids ENJOY going to the dentist because of this place. I will never switch. The front office ladies are sweet and quick! The assistants really care about the kids and take their time to help explain how important their teeth are. And the dentists are the best. So grateful for Lollipop Pediatric Dentistry!</Review>

Lollipop Pediatric always seem to take the fears from my little one. She went in crying and came out so happy. The staff is friendly and so is the dentist. Wait was small and visit was quick. It’s so kid friendly and although it’s not near my home, it’s worth the extra drive. Thank you for a great visit. We have been coming here since my daughter was one and now she is five. Not planning on changing dentists<//review>

This place first captures your attention with its lively staff and radiant colors that are kid friendly. They have a Professional and knowledgeable staff who truly is better than the other two (2) dentist I used before. The best thing according to my son is the T.V.'s playing Disney in the ceiling while he gets his teeth worked on. Truly an amazing place with a great staff that makes a kid and parent feel at ease. Keep up the good work. Mr. Martin #Tonysdad<//text>

<review>Got my first appointment for my son. We don't have permanent dentist. When we found this one, it was amazing. From front office all the way to back office staff. The place is very clean and staff are friendly. My son had a great experience with his teeth cleaning. He was calm the entire experience, and he was very happy about having a "No Cavity Club" certificate and a toy at the end of the visit. Briana Gonzales who assisted my son did a great job. Thank you, lollipop for a wonderful experience.</review><Pics>None</Pics><response>None<//response><gmap_id>0x80dcd41a9cb9c407:0x46701eda55e46929< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>
<Date>1592016762910< /Date><review>So today we brought our 2 1/2 yr. Old in for some fillings and were not sure if he would need some of his teeth removed. We were so nervous as we never had to place our child under anesthesia. The doctor and anesthesiologist were amazing!!!! They explained everything thoroughly and kept us updated throughout the whole procedure.
The doctor was able to save my sons teeth and he did not have to have any pulled. I wold 150% recommend this dental practice to anyone. I have already told a few friends that have not been able to fi d a dentist they like for their children. We also bring my 6yr. Old daughter here and she loves it!!! They are always sweet, professional, and honest! That is most important to me, honesty. If you want an amazing dentist to work on your kids I highly recommend Lollipop Dental/ Sweet Smiles ( :<//review><username>Saren Ortiz< /username><Gmap_id>0x80dcd41a9cb9c407:0x46701eda55e46929< /Gmap_id><Rating>5</Rating>< UserId.>

Brought my son for his first dentist appointment ever and wanted to find a place where he felt comfortable. THIS WAS IT! We loved the experience and he loved the free toy and sugar free lollipop he got at the end of the visit.

We're now back for his second annual visit and he remembers his first experience so it was easy getting him in the door. The toys in the waiting area also help<//Text>

Been coming to this location since 2015 for my boy's dental appointments. Almost 5 years later, now I’m bringing my second kid for her first check up. I have no complaints about the staff. They are amazing and very patient with my little ones. The office itself is colorful, bright and most importantly very clean!

PS we loved Dr. Judy!!!<//Text>

<Text>This place is amazing! For starters, the customer service is great. Everyone is cheery and welcoming. There's nothing but positive attitudes from the staff. The facility is truly kid friendly. My daughter loved that she got to watch a movie from "the sky" (the ceiling). The staff engaged so well with my daughter that it allowed me as a  parent to just sit back and observe the appointment as opposed to taking or maintaining control of the appointment.<//Text><Response>None<//Response>< rating>

I have been to the Garden Grove location as well as this one and I honestly prefer this location. Staff here is amazing with kids. They friendly and professional. Take the time to explain things. Jennifer made an impact on my son. He was super nervous about going to the dentist and on his way out he said he loved coming to the dentist. Best pediatric dentist hands down!!</Text>

I was struggling in finding to take my girls to the dentist. The places I would take them where just not meeting my expectations. I found lollipop pediatrics on yelp and saw that they had good reviews so I decided to give them a try. Best decision I’ve ever made!! Lollipop Pediatrics are AMAZING!! The staff is great and super friendly to the kids and parents. They are always welcoming and when they are working with your kids they are patient and make sure they feel confident with them. They have iPads where they put their favorite movies for them to relax when they have to do fillings or just their regular cleaning. I highly recommend this place for you to bring your kids you will not regret it.< /text>

Lollipop team doesn't disappoint. They are so friendly and upbeat. Our Daughter has been going there since she could walk. She was nervous for the treatment but she got in to her SpongeBob movie and me and Anna got to talking and it was all so cool. The whole experience really. Great job team and thank you for taking such professional and comforting care of our daughters 5 🌟< /Text>

My daughter is about 23 months old and has 16 teeth for months! This is her first time seeing dentist and she did great! The staff and dentist made it fun and easy and put my mind at ease too I was more scared than my daughter! It was good experience.  The only thing I'd complain is that it seems that the public bathroom has no changing table.</text>

Plus big thumps up on there organized way of doing things and the entertainment they have for the children.. love it I highly recommend bringing your child here.<//Review>

We have been going here for about 5years. It’s a bit of a drive, but definitely worth the piece of mind knowing that all of the people here are welcoming, calming and kind. Every time we come my boys don‘t want to leave. They get up early and are ready to go early when they know they have a dentists appointment. They have a lot of activities to keep the kids busy and happy while they wait. It’s never a long wait though, and it’s so easy to work with these great people, today each of the lovely ladies that did our cleanings (Anna, Laura, Breanna, and Doctor Judy)  were so patient and kind with the boys, it’s just a happy atmosphere, gotta love this place I definitely recommend it!<//review>

<Review>It is a Very Clean place. Child friendly.  fully prepare to deal with kids they are gentle and carefully plus parents are allowed during any treatment.
My kids did not cry at all usually they will cry out for mommy not this time the Dentist made them fill no pain.
I definally  will recommend this place because they teach your kids how to brush in front of mirror.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
Hands down best Pediatric Dental office.Came in on our first appointment at Lollipop dental very stressed/nervous. My daughter has always been that screaming child that needs to go in a private room. But Noo need for that in this office, ALL staff were friendly, patient and made my daughter feel comfortable. She was very happy and cannot stop talking about how she LOVED the office.</Review>

<review>We have gone to the Placentia/Yorba Linda office for 9 year and they have always been great! Very comforting and inviting for children. The staff has dress up days, they offer the kids to choose a movie to watch, they have sunglasses to wear, a toy chest for after their visit. In the waiting area they have tablets available to play with and train table. They also have a "No Cavity" club. Great Office, Great Staff, Great Experiences. Highly Recommend</review>< pictures>

I love the fact that they focus on children. Also their xrays are digital and very low  in radiation. M6 kids willingly come here. Also Priscilla at the front desk is very polite and helpful.  Thumbs up lollipop 👍< /review>

<time>1597108339215</time><Rating>1< /Rating><Review>My daughter had an appt for a cleaning and exam, the dentist came over at the end of the cleaning to discuss the xrays, she spoke to me for less than 3 min. Telling me my daughter had 4 cavities, 3 needed baby crowns and 1 needed a filling. She advised they should all be treated separately so that my daughter didn’t get overwhelmed with the treatment.
I trusted what she said and made an appt for the recommended treatment. However, I had to cancel that appointment because there seemed to be some type of discrepancy between Lollipop Dental, myself, and my insurance.
At the first appointment, I was advised that there were two options for those cavities, stainless steel or porcelain fillings/crowns. I advised that I did not want stainless steel and was then quoted for porcelain at the front desk at the end of our appointment. I then received an email with the treatment plan for my 4 year old daughter, and was advised that she needs 4 crowns and 1 filling, with a total of 5 cavities now. Which is very concerning to me, since the dentist did not mention 5 cavities at our first visit. I reached out to lollipop dental with my concerns regarding the treatment plan, however the difference in cavity count from the first visit and then the treatment plan email, was never resolved.  They also advised that the porcelain crowns they quoted me for were not covered by my insurance.
I contacted my insurance company to be sure that porcelain fillings and crowns were not covered under our benefits, only to find out that my daughters treatment plans and services are all covered under my insurance, that included porcelain and including the specific code that I was given by lollipop dental for the specific treatment. After advising the lollipop dental billing representative of that information, I gave her the provider phone number so that she can contact them further if needed.
I was then contacted over the phone by lollipop dental advising that unfortunately, my daughters crowns and fillings are not covered. I was advised that the type of filling/crown was now changed to Zirconia by lollipop, which again was concerning to me since I specifically asked the dentist at our appointment what options other than stainless steel were available, and was advised by the dentist (Dr. Pham), the front desk, and the lollipop phone rep that LOLLIPOP DENTAL ONLY OFFERS STAINLESS STEEL OR PORCELAIN fillings and crowns! How is it possible that now all of a sudden they offer Zirconia , and want to put that in my daughters mouth without telling me, and also not advising that on the quotes I was sent (the treatment plan quotes specifically stated porcelain for the type of crown and filling). I asked Lollipop dental over the phone why they stated it was a porcelain filling/crown and now changing it to Zirconia . I was advised that "We say porcelain because Zirconia has a white coating that makes it look like porcelain", are you kidding? That's exactly word for word what I was advised by Lollipop rep on the phone. Not only did the cavity count change in a 4 year old without the dentist seeing her other than the first appt , but then the type of treatment changed, without any type of explanation. Lollipop Dental continued to tell me my insurance doesn't cover the treatment but they COVER ALL TYPE OF CROWNS AND FILLINGS for my daughter, I confirmed 3 times with my insurance.
Three weeks have gone by since I reached out to Lollipop dental with all these concerns, to only be ignored until today. Today I received an email with the subject line saying “DISMISSAL LETTER” yes in all caps like that, real mature lollipop dental. Telling me that Dr. Pham can no longer be my daughters dentist, staying that “we cannot establish the necessary relationship vital to the success of your child’s dental care and treatment”. Oh ya Dr. Pham, that’s because you haven’t even attempted to create a trusted, ethical relationship with myself or my daughter! Thankfully I’ve found a great pediatric dentist who has treated us with Nothing but the upmost respect and we trust their practice!< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

I’m very pleased with my experience at Lollipop Dentistry. I’ve been bringing my son for the past year and a half and I am very happy to say my son has had a great transition from being extremely afraid of the dentist, to now being cooperative and allowing the assistants and doctor to work with him. Annalise has been the assistant to help us during our past few appointments and she is such a pleasure to work with! I’ll definitely be bringing my son for years to come and I highly recommend this facility to anyone on the search for a good dental office for kids!<//text>

Everyone is kind and helpful and works well with children.  It is a state of the art facility with latest technology and has many diversions such as games, toys, music, movies, etc to keep the kids distracted and focused.  I am really impressed with how well we were treated.<//Review>

<text>We lived in the area and found this gem. Our experiences to date have been so great that when we moved out of the area we still commute to our appointments. The kids get excited about our appointments! The staff is patient and kind when my kids change their minds about being excited, and they are still thorough about getting what needs to be done. Worth the travel and the rewards of the new toothbrush, balloon, lollipop, and golden coin prize!< /text><Rate>4< /Rate><Gmap_id>0x80dcd41a9cb9c407:0x46701eda55e46929< /Gmap_id>< user_name>

Took my three year old for his first visit. Initially I thought it wasn’t going to go well because my son hates going to the doctor but upon arrival, all the nurses made us feel very welcomed. They answered all my questions and interacted well with my son. The doctor was very informative and made my son feel very comfortable.<//Review>

We have been coming here for a little over three years now and absolutely love it. The staff is always ridiculously friendly and personable. Mary Pham is the sweetest and we love seeing her especially! The office is always organized and their order of doing things is efficient and quick. We couldn’t ask for a better dental office.<//review>

I emailed photos to them but have yet to receive a call back.  I took my son to the pediatrician and she confirmed there are no other health issues but the abrasions.  We won't be back.  UPDATE:  I did hear back from the dentist's office staff and then the dentist after I asked to speak with her.  After a follow up appointment it turns out the injuries were caused by the procedure - either the chemicals burned his mouth or the suction from the device used during the procedure caused the wounds.  Six days later, my little boy was finally able to eat solid food.<//review><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

While they are very kind, the dental assistants are not trained to use periodontal instruments to "clean" the patients' teeth. They used them on my children. This is NOT within their scope of practice.<//text>

Not only has she done all their dental work, we've used them for their orthodontics as well. We cannot say enough good things about this office and we refer everyone we know here. I hear they are opening a new, larger office and that will be great!! They've definitely outgrown the one their in, because they are THAT amazing.</Review>< pictures>

<review>The facility itself is 5 star and the customer service is excellent. However they will nickel and dime you when it comes to procedures. They allot 1 hour for procedures because they don’t want to “overwhelm the patient” in other words keep coming back while we Nickle and dime you. It is what it is it’s a business I get it.< /review><Rating>2<//Rating></record>

<Text>The whole appointment was very rushed. Although the dentist was very nice for the two minutes we talked to her the dental technician seemed in a hurry and did not explain much to my daughter. She even scared her by sticking the suction in her mouth with no warning. This made her scared and cry and the tech just rushed through the rest. She also said, " a lot of kids don't like the taste of this" and she painted the "vitamin" on my 4 year old's teeth. So, of course my daughter over reacted and was scared to swallow. The waiting room and office was over all chaotic and extremely busy. Not a great experience.<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None</response>< gmap_id>

My daughter (5 years old) had to have some dental work done and the staff didn’t rush her when she became scared and I never sensed any frustration from the staff with the time they spent to calm her down and talk to her about what they were going to do.<//Text>

The staff is always super friendly. The dental assitants are very gentle and understanding of my children. Always encouraging the kids and their techniques to teach the children are amazing. My kids actually love going to the dentist.< /review>

<Review>I felt my visit today warranted a new and updated review.  I have to say, this office has it down with both efficiency and remarkable staff!!  Sincerely.  Truly genuine on the care and concern not just for the kids, but parents too.  I witnessed a hygienist get screamed at in her face, and spat on during my visit.  She kept smiling and just was very calm as to not rile up the young boy any further.  Complete control and professionalism.  I administer a local community page called The Placentia Buzz.  I shout out your office as often as I can, and I'm so pleased to be able to continue to do that with confidence and first hand experience.  Keep up the great work!!!<//Review>< Pics>

We love Lollipop Pediateic Dental! Oir son has been going there since he was 4. The staff is very warm and patient, the dentists are great with the kids and very knowledgeable with up to date care and treatment services. The facility is clean and bright and have video monitors for the kids to enjoy movies while getting their treatment which is a nice plus. Overall, highly recommend this dentist.< /Text>

Both my kids (4&6) love this dentist!! My six year old had a terrible experience at her first dentist visit a few years ago with a different dentist office so I was desperate to find a place that she was comfortable with. I was referred to Lolipop through a family member and honestly I’m so thankful for that because both of my kids now love visiting the dentist! The staff is so friendly and they have a great way of interacting with kids to help ease them through their cleanings or whatever treatments :)< /review>

<Review>Friendly, efficient and very child oriented staff. My 6 kiddos age range 9 years to 1year and are all seen at the same time. We are out in one hour. The staff does a great job communicating with each other as the kids rotate stations: teeth brushing check, x-rays, teeth cleaning and doctor check. They have movies playing during the process to help distract the children. Child receives toothbrush, toothpaste, prize, lollipop, and balloon. Location is clean and has plenty of parking.<//Review>< pictures>

We had a terrible experience at the Placentia office with my 5 year old son. The staff acted like they were not equipped to deal with children, which was shocking, as they’re a pediatric dentists office. They seemed inexperienced and were slow to start the work which made my sons anxiety even worse. After making him wait for 15 minutes with the laughing gas mask his face which was pumping oxygen and not the gas to calm him down he began to cry. They said that they can’t do the work if he’s crying. We forced my son to sit in the chair for 30 minutes crying for them to tell me they can’t do the work. They didn’t even try! It was so upsetting to put my son through that to have them refuse to do the work. I will never go back there.<//Text>

I've been over all happy with this office and the way they have treated my child, but when it comes to billing I arrived in the office to have my daughter fitted for her 2nd Round of Braces yesterday and they young women at the front desk were very awkward when discussing what they said was an outstanding balance.  I would have preferred them discussing a private matter any place else other than the waiting room filled with people.  We had made financial arrangements to pay for the braces by making monthly payments prior to our visit and my daughters Grandmother had also paid them a deposit on the last appointment. I don't know what sort of outstanding balance they are talking about and have not discussed this with me directly.  I hope to give them a better review, but the front desk ladies did not handle this well and could use training on how to discuss private matters with their patients families.  Moving forward I hope to give them a better review.  I'm giving them a chance to improve as the back office staff is pretty good and I've been happy with them and the dentist and orthodontist.</text>

Hands down, one of the best pediatric dentistry I have taken my kids . They take the time show you around and the process of how they do things around there, makes you feel welcomed and have a iPad station play room so the kids feel comfortable. Let alone the people there are well trained . They take the time to talk to you. Most of all they make the kids feel welcomed and not scared ! Which is their profession. I am happy I decided to take my kids to a pediatrics dentistry. I’m highly recommending Lollipop 🍭<//Review>

LOVE everything about this office and their whole approach to pediatric dental care. The office atmosphere provides a calm, friendly and playful environment that helps children forget about the anxiety or stress they may be feeling by being at the "Dr". The dental assistant (sorry I can't remember your name but you rock!)  and Dr. Pham were both exceptional with my 4 year old daughter. I couldn't have asked for a better 1st time visit! SO happy we found you!< /review>

All of the staff was very welcoming and the environment was very kid-friendly. The assistant that brushed her teeth and did the cleaning was very good with her and informative. My daughter kept talking about her and pretended to be her at home with her own dolls with the mirror and gloves she gave her. The only thing I would suggest is getting a bigger place since it was a little crowded and it seems like this dentist office is bound to grow. :)</Text>< Pictures>

I love all the staff here.  They are well trained and give great advice.  Dr. Marcus is all smiles!!! I love it.  Front office Maria was quick at checking all 3 kids in Pilar the Manager was very welcoming and has a gentle touch.  The back office staff Shantel, Jennifer, Amanda and most importantly their lead Hannaleise made us feel at home.  I will never go to another pediatric dental office as this office is close to home and my kids love it!!!</text>< Pictures>

< Review>
Two stars because the Dr. Pham is great and wait times are not so bad. But I called the day of my appointment to reschedule because I was not feeling well and as someone that works in health care and just generally caring about others I thought it wouldn't be a good idea to spread whatever I had around. However, after calling and trying to reschedule I was told I would be charged a fee. I get it but can't an exception be made? Nope! I was told I had to go in or pay the fee. Ok so fine I'll go in... turns out I have strep throat. Why would people in the health care industry treat people that way. They should really revisit their policies or hire more caring people.  If it wasn't for Dr.Pham I would change providers.<//Review>

I switched my kids to Lollipop after bad experiences with another pediatric dentistry. We've been really happy here. I feel like they make honest recommendations for treatment, and they are very kind and patient.</text>

I have been taking my kids to Lollipop for years. They are efficient, kind, and patient. My 9 year old just started her braces treatment. Ayde Rodarte has helped us a few times. She is GREAT! She explains everything, breaks down the payment plan, and is very patient with my little chatty 9 year old. I would highly recommend for dentistry and Orthodontia.<//review>

I have been going to lollipop since my girl was 3 and I wanted to have the same dentist for my son too but I’m shattered for the way I was treated for a $100 bill that I got for rescheduling my daughter’s appointments. My husband got into an accident and his work truck was totaled in the accident. We have one car now, I rescheduled 6 appointments for my daughter. Also left voicemails too that please reschedule the appointment coz I don’t have a car and I can’t Uber with two kids. In return I received a $100 bill for no show! Disappointed on how low they can go! I’m not going to lollipop dentist anymore.< /Review>

Dr. Mary and her staff are terrific! Both children were only 3 years old when they had their first dental exam and everyone went leaps and bounds above my expectations to make them feel comfortable and informed about their teeth and dental hygiene.  I highly recommend Lollipop Dental to any parent who is looking for a friendly, tech-savy and highly qualified pediatric dental office.  Thank you to everyone in the office for your patience and care!< /text>

I was charged  30% above the price quote provided to me for the out of pocket pay in addition to coverage from insurance.  I was not so happy about it.<//Text>

<Review>I’m filing a law suit against this office because my son was in pain and was bleeding because the space maintainer they put on him were broken and they said it’s ok for him to be uncomfortable. I had to take him to the hospital because he got infection from the cuts he had from the space maintainer. When I told the dr that my son went to the hospital, they scheduled an app for him and removed the broken spacers. They told me we have to check with the insurance about getting a new spacer and get back to you by the end of the week. It took her 2 weeks and me calling every week to tell me the insurance does not cover a new one and I have to pay $750. I don’t understand how there’s no sort type of warranty?! On top of that the dr. is rushing and explaining the urgency to put a new space maintainer because the space is getting smaller not leaving a room for the tooth to come out, therefore my son will have to do a surgery.
So basically they do whatever work to get paid by insurance companies, and then to redo the same work but this time they charge the patient.
Btw, I asked for the broken spacer to take it to a different dentist and repair it, they said they tossed it out.
Again, they don’t want to leave any proofs for their crime.< /Review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

I am so extremely grateful that I was referred by my friend to this amazing office. First I would like to say that we had an absolute nightmare experience at a dentist with my daughter and it was horrific(I'm not over exaggerating it was easy a law suit).... Finding a new dentist was scary... I did not want my child to go though that ever again. This office is welcoming, clean , friendly, kind and they do not strap your child down like an insane person! they also let you be in the room ❤ that is the way it should be. I'm extremely impressed and my children are excited to go now. Thank you so much lollipop dentistry!!!<//Review>

So this will be our 2nd year here. I absolutely love this place for my girls (5&3 yrs). They are patient with kids  and is just a fun place to be at . You may not get the same dentist Everytime you come in but every single one I have met are professional and well qualified.
I wish they opened a small section for adults!  It would be so convenient and honestly everyone there seems to be happy.<//review>

Easily the best pediatric dentistry in Orange County. They’ve helped my daughter have zero fear regarding dental and orthodontic work, while providing a wonderful environment for children and parents alike.<//Review>

Awesome pediatric dentistry, would definitely recommend to anyone! My daughter had a great first time visit to the dentist. She wasn't afraid at all because they try to make the kids feel as comfortable as possible. They have ipads for the kids to play with and  they put on a movie for them to watch while they're getting work done and at the end they get a balloon, lollipop, and a gift from the treasure box.

They gave you a tour at the beginning and they are detailed and efficient in explaining as they go along all the procedures they're doing. The dental assistants and the dentist are so sweet and patient with the children you can tell they love doing what they do. The atmosphere is fun and bright, all the office staff was very friendly. We had an amazing experience and again I would highly recommend Lollipop Pediatric Dentistry.< /Review>

Dr. Ikeda was amazing with my 4 year old that has never done well at the dentist.  She spoke to her in terms she could understand and I couldn’t believe my little one was sitting still for Dr. Ikeda! Great staff and experience.   I highly recommend</text>

My experience here was amazing. They took x-rays on my 3 year old with no problem I switched from a different place to here because they don't use any oral sedations to work on kids. I'm so happy with the doctor and staff wish I found them sooner!...< /Text>

I love lollipop dentistry, and my daughter loves the experience. All the dental assistants my daughter has had have been very fun and patient. However, today my daughter had a dental assistant that was not very fun and patient with her. That did not make it easier on my daughter who has a sensory issue. Usually I don’t have to worry about telling the dental assistants there that she has a sensory issue because they are very gentle and patient with her, and it makes things go more smoothly. In addition to that, it creates more comfort for my daughter. Sadly, today she was tensing up so much that the dental assistant just told her not to with a bit of an irritated voice like it was no big deal. Well, sensory is a big deal to my daughter. You cannot just tell her to basically get over it. It’s called accomodation and patience, especially if you are working with kids! Be more creative and tactful. Turn it into a game if you have to! By this point I didn’t want to say anything because I didn’t want to come off sounding upset. But now I’m kicking myself for it, because maybe something could have changed. I also did not want to inconvenience the dental office, but now that I think about it, I should have done what was best for my daughter. My husband and I questioned whether this particular dental assistant was in the right place. Otherwise, she has a long way to go when dealing with kids. All the other dental assistants have allowed her to choose her tooth brush, choose the teeth cleaning flavor, choose the sun glasses, and choose the fluoride flavor. She even forgot to give my daughter a No Cavity Club certificate that she works hard for and looks forward to every 6 months. Even though my daugter told her dad and I how different today was in there and shared her feelings about her experience, we were all disappointed in the lack of patience. Mainly because this is not representative of who lollipop dentistry is.< /review>

Dr. Ikeda and the ortho team- Jodi, Jaime, Zang, Ayde, Celeste, Gabbie, Leslie,  and Ana have been professional and provided exceptional care through my daughters braces, scheduling and communication was simple and all my questions and concerns were addressed.

During my daughter's experience, I learned that Dr. Ikeda also sees adults, and I chose to get braces myself after many years. My daughter now has a retainer and her smile is beautiful. I would highly recommend Dr. Ikeda to parents considering ortho care!!< /review>

<Text>This place was amazing. Minimal wait times, movie/ipad room for the little ones.  Jeremy was our dental assistant and I couldn't say enough good things about him.  He was patient, super friendly and very thorough.  My son loved going and is constantly asking me to return.  He received an hourglass timer which encourages him to brush more frequently just so he could use it. Will never go anywhere else.  I also observed thorough cleaning and santizing at all times<//Text>< Pictures>

Then I was told I have to come back to have them filled, but there's no appointments for a month.  The kids had fun though.

Edit: Since my daughter is particularly afraid of the dentist and this office is equipped to handle her, I had decided to keep this as her dentist office.  The wait is not always so long and overall I've been ok with the staff and Dentists.  It takes a long time to get an appointment still.  So I'm giving it more stars.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

The best dentist for our 3 children.  Dr. Pham and the entire staff are always educating and consulting with us on procedures and pricing. Our children are healthier and happier after visits.<//Text>

When I got there I forgot the insurance card and they refused to see my daughter. I took her out of school and I explained I left at home I offered to send a picture as soon as I got home. They verified eligibility but refused to see her. I had to reschedule a whole new appointment. My daughter was dissapointed as she was looking forward to her appt. I just felt they didn't provide any options. I I understand it's policy but they could have made an exception.< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

My 22 months son has a cavity, I try to find a pediatric dentist for him. This office is a little bit far from our home, but I am glad we went. The office staff are really friendly and professional. I love Dr. Mary too, she is super nice, and really patient.<//text>

This is worst than a marketing caller.

If someone is not coming back to your place means they don't liked your service and thats not a reason for any bussines to call people to come back.

Stop calling to personal phones.</review>

So I just moved to placentia and was looking for a pediatric dentistry for my three and five year old. I searched ones closest to me (with good reviews) and found Lollipop Dentistry. I noticed it had almost five stars and started doing a little research. This place is beyond amazing. From the moment we walked in today as new patients we were greeted and talked to and taken care of. The check in was quick and easy. Leslie was amazing with the kiddos. She greeted them by name and made it fun and enjoyable for them. She is AWESOME!!! She took the time to explain things to them and made it so much fun. All I had to do was kick back and relax. 😊 The environment is so tailored to the kids that they don't even know they are at the dentist. Again Leslie was GREAT! Once Leslie was done cleaning we saw Dr. Mary Pham. Her energy was fantastic. My kids loved her and said she was very nice. She explained things to me and took the time to make sure that I really understood what the next steps would be in caring for my sons cavities. I highly recommend this Dentistry to all mommies with young children. Amazing office and even more amazing staff!!! Thanks so much guys!!!!!<//text>

<rate>5<//rate><review>WOW!  Best dentist ever!  Let me start by first saying that they accept Medi-cal Dental, I am so thankful my sons get to go to a pediactric only dentist, in a beautiful office!  All of the staff were so friendly and knew how to work with kids to put them at ease.  My older son's favorite part was the x-rays!  I loved how they had the boys brush their teeth so they could observe how well they were doing on their own and give tips for at home.  The whole office has an open concept so I could see both of my boys during their appointment, as they were seen at the same time, on-time.  They each left there with a new oral-b toothbrush, toothpaste, dental-friendly lollipop, balloon, and toy prize!  My older son, 5, has already showed improved teethbrushing skills and excitement for good oral hygiene, including turning down sweets!  My younger son, 3, wasn't so excited about the dentist, but still got his teeth brushed and flossed, thus showing mom and dad how to do it better, an exam, and flouride treatment!  Plus, he has Down Syndrome, and Dr. Pham has treated many special needs patients before which put me at ease.</review>< Pictures>

< Review>
This is the BEST pediatric dentist office EVER! When you walk in, it doesn't feel like a dental office at all. You'll know what I mean when you go there. It's bright, fun, and just makes you feel good as soon as you walk in. Dana, who works in the front, is really sweet and makes  you feel like you're an old friend. Dr. Pham is just wonderful with the kids. You can tell she really cares about your children and takes the time to educate you on the best ways to keep your kids cavity free! They have TV's on the ceiling that play movies for the kids, a theater room, not to mention ipads and legos to make sure kids of all ages are entertained. You also get a Xylitol Lollipop for liking their Facebook page. Who says you can't have candy at the dentist? Xylitol lollipops at this dentist are actually GOOD for your teeth AND kill the bacteria that cause cavities. Your kids will leave with a bag of goodies, balloons, but most importantly a BIG HUGE SMILE for having such a wonderful experience at the dentist. I can't wait for our next visit. Thanks Dana and Dr. Pham!<//Review>
