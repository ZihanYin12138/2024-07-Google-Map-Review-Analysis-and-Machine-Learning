Hope to see you soon!'}<//response>< Text>
Had called to make an appointment to get insurance on my car over the phone as to i live in fresno and the office is in Visalia. They scheduled me for an appointment for the next morning at 9am. I never received a call from them. I called multiple times and no answer. I had to drive over there to get service. The service was very good once i got there. I was helped by the manager who was very professional and helped me out on getting a more affordable price on my new car. All in all even though they did not answer the phone nor call me for my appointment, their prices are more than worth it and their customer service is really good in person.<//Text>

I went in there to get a title transfer and Bernice B. helped me out. She was very nice and professional, I was nervous to do my title transfer through a third party but she made it very fast, easy, and comfortable since insurance places always make me nervous since I don’t know much about insurance so she educated me very well. I will keep booking my appointments with her only!</review>

Terrible Service everytime I go in the wait time is hours. Not mins and once you speak to a insurance broker they are so busy trying to up sell they do not listen to your needs as a customer. Its insane how badly they treat you when you stand up for yourself and ask them to stop trying to sell you a new policy with 100s of dollars in "New policy fees"   I just wanted to make a cash payment instead I ended up walking out. And just paying over the phone.  Don't go here. The Fiesta in Hanford either both are connected and both have the almost the same issues. Try other locations if at all possible.<//review>

<text>I've been with fiesta auto for almost 3 years and it's the cheapest by far.i would recommend fiesta to anyone. Only reason I didn't put 5 stars is because there are times when I go to pay my bill and I'm having to wait.they could probably use more employees during busy hours.<//text>< Pics>

<Review>Very slow. I understand it's a business and with any business, you need time. All day, maybe 1 or 2 ppl work and they take their sweet time knowing there's a line of freakin 5 ppl waitin to be seen. I waited an whole HOUR AND HALF just to pay a bill. No I can't pay my bill over the phone nor via internet......hence why I go into the store in the first place. NEED MORE WORKERS!!!!!!!</Review>< Pics>

Daniel and his colleague (also an RDA)were extremely accomaodating, positive, and knowledgeable. I'm a  Registered Dental Hygienist and understand the business of Dentistry. I was pleasantly pleased by the educated conversation and price reduction by cutting out the middle man dentist. Very pleased with the professionalism and knowing this isn't some scam type business.< /text>

<Text>Great experience. Definitely a next-gen dental company without the baggage of the typical, old-fashioned dental offices. Simple, designed experience. Staff is kind and professional. Amy was great to work with. I imagine this will completely replace the classic orthodontic process for most people, within the next couple of years.< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics><username>Jason Kim< /username>< Rate>

Amy and Gary were amazing! I was greeted quickly by Gary who I had a great conversation with. Amy scanned my teeth, we also had a awesome conversation, and she filled me in on everything I needed to know. She answered all my questions and answered most of them before I even got the chance to ask! The process was quick, easy, and exciting! I felt very comfortable and at ease since both Amy and Gary were so cool and genuine. I didn’t feel at any point pressured to make a decision or purchase, but their kindness and knowledge helped me realize I wanted to join the smile direct club! Thank you both for your help and I appreciate how kind, caring, and knowledgeable you both were. If anyone is on the fence about smile direct club, make an appointment with them online or on the phone and check it out! I’m excited for my care kit to come, thanks guys!<//Text>

I’m glad I did it because I was told it’s more accurate than using the at-home plaster kit. It was super easy to schedule online, and the company sent confirmations by email and text with directions to the office that were simple to follow. I was even able to reschedule online easily and get my appointment the same day. The whole process was straight forward... Amy helped me and she’s very nice, thorough, and amazing ! The people who work with you are certified dental assistants, so you know you can trust them with the scan. I was surprised the scan didn’t create any mess as a molding would normally do. I took a picture of my scan cause I thought it was pretty cool to see a 3-D image of my teeth. Overall a great experience with the location, staff and appointment. I’m so excited and can’t wait for my trays to come in the mail. Hope it works !!!!<//Review><pics>None</pics><response>{'time': 1559833192040, 'text': 'Wow! This means a lot to us, Elaine.

I am really happy I made and went to the Smile Direct Club physical location. I wasn’t sure what exactly it would entail. First I went to the reception room and I was somewhat confused. It felt like maybe this was just going to be another sales pitch!?
After I said I wanted to wait to think about it, I waited for a little and another assistant walked out. She took me into a different room and asked some questions about why I was interested. Chenell was amazing and explained everything in great detail. She made me feel very comfortable as well.

I was so happy to learn I didn’t have to do any gross molds of my teeth! I’ve always hated those trays with the mold material, always made me want to gag lol. At Smile Direct Club they have a super techie machine that takes 3D images that the Dentist uses to make the retainers!! It was pretty cool.

They have a referral program for $ off and I got a free whitening kit and a swag bag. Honestly very surprised and happy with my experience. I was really unsure what I was walking into, but I am highly considering joining Smile Direct club and I really appreciate your products and services!!< /text>

My experience at the Smile Direct shop in Aliso Viejo was very positive today. Both Daniel and Jeanine were friendly and knowledgeable. Best part was Jeanine performed my scan quickly and without discomfort. They both answered all of my questions- I look forward to receiving my aligners. Thanks for the great experience!< /text>

<review>This is a great place and an amazing service. From the moment you are welcomed, through the appointment and scan, is an excellent, professional experience. It was very easy to schedule an appointment, which only lasted about a half-hour. Alex did an excellent job of scanning my teeth to render a perfect, three-dimensional representation of the teeth that this remarkable service will adjust.

This concept, of using thin plastic "aligners" that cover your teeth to gradually adjust them over time, instead of  traditional steel braces using wire, clamps and rubber bands, is revolutionary.  And up until this service, pretty expensive.  But for a variety of reasons having to do with technology and scalability, this service is far less expensive than other services.  Our son received his set and is on the second week and is having no problems.  So I am quite excited to get started.<//review>< Pictures>

I was nervous at first, but I have been wanting to take a step forward to getting my old smile back. I’m so happy I took the leap, and made a consultation appointment! Both Gary and Allen helped me by answering questions, showing me my 3D scan smile, and feel excited about the whole process. Looking forward to having more reasons to smile now with straighter, whiter teeth! Thanks guys!</text>

The two persons that helped me were great! Alan did a very good job scanning my teeth and making me feel very comfortable in their clean, modern office.

The process was super easy and quick. Now that I’ve paid, all that I have to do is wait for the mouth piece kit to arrive in the mail and I can start to straighten my over crowded teeth. Cool!< /Review>

< Review>
Went for my scan and to sw the technician.  She was very articulate and very helpful.  Thoroughly enjoyed the visit.  I’m older and my teeth have always been very straight.  The past 2 years have been stressful and I know I grind my teeth at night which may have caused my teeth to move.  I like the way she presented all the details and.facts.  Signed up and this past Sunday used my first set of aligners< /Review>

My appointment at SmileDirectClub was very efficient and educational. A 3D scan of my smile was created in minutes. My technician asked for my input on what aspects of my smile that I wanted to improve. She showed me a sample set of aligners and explained the entire treatment process, including pricing.  The office was sleek, clean and and bright! Great experience!</Review>

<review>It was an amazing experience. Friendly environment and very professional staffs. I would like to make a special thank to JP, Aron, Tamara, and Desiree for taking the extra time to explain everything. The appointment was supposed to be only 30 minutes, however they spent an hour and a half to help me. Would recommend this place to anybody looking for a good smile :))))< /review>< UserId.>

I am very excited to have a Smile Direct Club location so close.  The entire staff was quite friendly and the tech that did my 3D imagining could not have been more knowledgeable and nicer.  He was great and answered all my questions.  Pee Jay was so very nice and really knew what he was doing and explained everything to me.  I was in there for scans to do my refinements and he could not have been more thorough.   He took down all the notes from my dentist and ensured that the detailed notes and photos from my dentist would be included in the 3D scans he was sending to SDC Local Dentist for review.  I’m excited about this company and so are the staff at this location.  It was a very enjoyable experience and I’d recommend the entire program to everyone.

Simple as 1-2-3. From setting the appointment, to the detailed directions emailed to me, to the reminder email, friendly and professional staff (JP, Jeanine, Omar and team are phenom), clean office, in and out in 30 minutes, simple and easy payment options. Done and Done. 1st and Last visit. Trays arrive in about 4 weeks, without any need to return to the office. Extremely well done and great buyer experience. Thanks SDC Aliso Viejo.< /Text>

<review>THE Best Money I EVER spent!! So happy with every aspect of these 'braces' & it's 70% less than InvisAlign.  All of my teeth-straightening needs are in one box, sent to my home, with NO extra visits to the orthodontist. I had to pop into the new Aliso Veijo office for minor tweakage and I was so happy to have met Jeanine...what a doll...she couldn't have been nicer. If you do need an adjustment to your trays it is completely covered under the initial payment. SmileDirect has done right by me and I would recommend this to any one of ANY age. I'm 100 and I feel like my teeth have never looked better. The next closest office is in Orange, way up the 5-55-22 freeways. Even if you live north of Irvine you should go see Jeanine. She saw me within 2 minutes of my appointment time and was professional and knowledgeable and thorough during my exam. I would definitely go back if a need arose. I recommend SmileDirect to anyone who asks, friends and family alike. One very happy customer here!
Cheers...

< review>
Initial experience here at the scan center was lovely, however treatment from the headquarters and virtual support team has been extremely poor. Was deeply unhappy with the suggested digital treatment plan and have now been asked to sign a release form waiving all my rights to talk about this experience in order to get my money back.

I'm now filing a complaint with the BBB instead of signing the form. I've never even received a set of retainers because the digital result looked awful, and after a month of emailing them to try and get my money back, here they are sending me a form asking me to waive any rights to post about them in exchange for a payment of $250.

Wasn't planning on writing reviews or talking about the experience but now feel obligated to share this piece of information for anyone like myself, who might not realize what this company's business practices are actually like. Silencing people isn't the way to go. If someone isn't happy with the services received, consider improving your customer support team, communication practices, instead of trying to hold my refund hostage until I give up all of my rights as a consumer.<//review>

Honest, friendly and knowledgeable mechanics! The owners are super nice, the prices have always seemed fair and comparable. One time I was quoted inaccurately and didn't notice, but the owners called me later when my truck was on the lift and corrected the quote which saved me about $400. Honestly, they could have left the quote at the original price and I wouldn't have known the difference but they have always been honest with me and never try to upsell me on stuff I don't need. I really appreciate that and I  will continue to only use Speedy Lube.< /Text>

I would definitely suggest going to Speedy Lube Auto Repair for any of your car repair needs. They do quality work and don’t try to swindle you for money. They are incredibly reasonably priced and will work hard to ensure that all of your needs are met. They clearly prioritize customer satisfaction and I can most definitely say that they far exceeded any expectations I had for a car mechanic.<//text>

Service was decent. Prices decent. Service is definitely not speedy. The receipt showed that they check tire pressure and clean windows but none of this was done. I honestly just think they've outgrown the facilities. It's always busy and I don't think they can keep up with demand. Customer service was not an issue but customer experience is lacking. The waiting room is always hot with the lack of shades on the wall of Windows. The TV was playing infomercials the entire time. Overall I would only suggest this place if you are dropping the vehicle off and you are not is a rush.<//Review>

<review>Our car broke down in the desert at 3pm on the way back from a brutally cold camping trip. The nearest tow service was over 2 hours away, so we got into town after a 55 mile tow and all the shops were closed for the night. The next morning, we waited outside Speedy Lube for it to open, since we were now missing work due to delays and wanted to be first in line. The owner was absolutely wonderful, and got the car fixed and back on the road quickly, for a reasonable price! It has been 6 weeks and the car is running strong. We would come here regularly if we didn't live 145 miles away!</review></record>

They are very good people. If you want a specific oil, bring it and they will use it, filter, same deal. It's a convenience business, the guy who mentioned it's easy to do and they overcharge, okay, change your own! Sometimes I don't feel like doing it, pay them and it's done in flash.< /review>

<text>We arrived very close to closing time, but Jorge gladly accepted our service request.

The oil change was done quickly and courteously and for a reasonable price.

Everyone there was friendly and made us feel welcome while waiting for things to be finished up.

I only needed an oil change this time, but if I'm in town again and need something more, I'm going to come here.< /text>< userid>

Always helpful and friendly, they know their stuff and work hard to get you back on the road, they also do more than just oil changes, they replace water pump, power steering pump, radiator, starter, and more, nothing but good things to say about them here!</Text>

Go anywhere else to get your car fixed if you can. If you must go there for repairs, expect it to take all day and for them not to notify you of anything else that's wrong with your vehicle.<//Text>

<Text>Crooks.  My father took his truck in to have brakes checked and replaced if needed.  They told him his entire brake system needed replacing minus the master cylinder and brake lines.  They said everything was shot even though I took it there a month prior and it just needed new pads.  Careful they try to ripoff the elderly.< /Text>< pics>

Nicest people EVER.  They stayed after hours with me because my car broke down and I was stranded and I had to wait for my ride to come from 3 hours away.  Great work on the car, great service, highly recommend!!<//Review>

<review>I haven't eaten Sushi for almost a year due to COVID as I felt take home Sushi won't be as good as the ones in restaurant. But I wanted to eat Sushi so badly recently so I decided to just give it a try. It was amazing!! Fresh and delicious, just the same as eat it in the restaurant. The price is also very reasonable. Will definitely order again.</review>< Pics>

My wife and I ordered the dragon roll, lion king roll, rainbow roll and tempura (4 shrimp pieces + veggies - zucchini, yam?, Yellow sweet potato, broccoli and green beans). For each of the rolls, we upgraded to real crab meat for an additional $3 dollars each, unfortunately, one of the rolls came with imitation crab, but the restaurant was quick to remedy the situation over email and we were extremely satisfied with their customer service. I would highly recommend coming here, they give ample portioned sizes for sushi. Thank you #FUJISUKIYAKI ! We hope you continue to stay in business!</review>

Authentic and Delicious!
Sunday night at 630 and the Fuji Sukiyaki was busy. We were greeted by efficient wait staff who let us know we would have a 20 min wait. We were seated 20 min later but had to wait another 15 min before we were served. Once our order was taken we were treated to delicious Miso soup then we selected an assortment of rolls and sashimi. Everything was fresh, delicious, and perfectly prepared. The prices were excellent for the area and we decided we will be back soon and often.</review>

Walked in on a Saturday afternoon to no wait. Surprised to see how small the place is inside (although they do have a back area for large parties). Service was lackluster and food okay.

The photos on Yelp made the sushi look so appetizing, but the rolls were nothing to rave about. They were small and not well made.

I would stick to the nigiri and sashimi here as it seems to be their specialty. The oyster bomb and sunrise nigiri were pretty good.

Overall it was a decent place for some variety of nigiri, but nothing too special.< /review>

<review>Amazing Japanese food, the price is reasonable. That's why even at 3:00 PM, we came with 8 people, still quite a few of the customers sitting around the restaurant. The service is pretty good, quick and easy with smiling face.
I definitely will come again!<//review>< pictures>

Freshest fish every time. This is the only sushi place I’ll eat at ranging from San Jose to south San Francisco. Consistent quality, family run business and chill environment. Always great!</review>

We were asking the restaurant staff what to order or her recommendation in order to help us decide faster. But instead, she showed us the menu and ask us to look and choose on our own. And say she will come back.

Helping customer decide what to order could have improved customer satisfaction.< /Text>

<text>Wow! What a pleasant surprise this one was. Quick service, great quality, very friendly and personable Sushi chef in charge. The staff were incredibly courteous and attentive. Overall, just an Amazing experience considering it's not the fanciest place but it sure packs a punch for sure. The food was equally wonderful and savory. Definitely a must see if you're ever in San Mateo and craving sushi. Well done!</text>< Pics>

<Text>Excellent food, priced at about the mid-level for sushi restaurants, service seems to be slipping as I’ve needed to repeatedly ask for water. Not giving up on them yet as it’s good food, location and not being crowded enough to have to wait for a table keeps me coming back.< /Text><user_name>JimmieHiggins<//user_name>< GmapID>

<review>Probably best value for sushi is downtown San Mateo. Sushi chefs are competent but not exceptional (sorry guys!). However, what they lack in precision they more than make up for in friendliness. Their rolls are the best way to go; good value and generous portions. Staff is always polite and attentive. I've never had a bad meal. Lastly, the "private" shoji rooms are excellent for special meals ... or a little romance (oh my!).<//review>< Pictures>

<Text>Simple Japanese restaurant, with very good food, a nice selection of sake, some good Japanese beer, with a fair price. There are some reserved spaces up to 6 patrons, seated in Japanese style (low table). Waiters look like from same family and give good suggestions.< /Text></record>

This is a great place for high quality sushi. Pretty fresh overall as well. Two different types of meeting one if which being horigatatsu style. They have rotating specials which should be taken into consideration as they too are of great quality instead of the chef trying out new dishes. A must go to in San Mateo.< /Text>

2nd time here. Food is above average. Service is pretty decent.
Got "box D" and it was a TON of food for ~20. The tonkatsu was a tad salty and the teriyaki chicken was a bit sub par. Was too stuffed to try the salmon. Gave the Cali rolls to my kids.< /Review>

<Review>Excellent sushi, and everyone that works there is super nice. If it’s a Friday night and it’s packed, you might have to wait a little while for your fish. Order a hot appetizer from the kitchen while you wait! Gyoza and agedashi tofu are delicious too.< /Review><time>1512182433876</time><rate>5</rate>< username>

<text>Been here twice so far for dinner.  Ordered the 49er roll and Superbowl roll and I found the quality to be excellent.  The wait staff attentiveness was excellent - she was present and timely but not overbearing.  Aside from the food, being away from the central downtown bustle, makes for a quieter, more relaxing ambiance.</text></record></dataset><record>

Really not the best sushi!! It was definitely disappointing. Our eal wasn't cut properly and was very sharp when you swallowed it. The service was slow and the waitress was a bit pushy.<//Text>

Good sushi, very friendly staff and prompt service! Price is comparable to other sushi places in downtown San Mateo, but this one seems to be the only one that's open in the early afternoon, which is a huge plus!<//Text>

I went to Fuji Sukiyaki about 5 1/2 years.  My experience was a wondwrful experience. I use to go in with my boyfriend at that time and we woukd go at least once a week. The bill use come out around 25 bucks or so each time.  The owner would suggest stuff and we would try it.  We got to know each other and would call us by our first names.  The owner knew we were in love with each other and we made him happy by bringing him business once a week. As soon as we walked in he woukd give us samples to try. I know when we never returned because we broke up, the owner must have thought something went wrong week after week we both didnt show up. I just so happened to think of the past today and I wish I could go back and eat at the Sushi place again with my ex boyfriend to feel again what falling in love was.  Thank you to the owner for showing us good customer service skills and to fill our bellys with good food. I know both my ex and I we had appreciate you.  Thank you !<//text>

Had a last minute change of plans for lunch due to our original planned lunch spot being closed, so I pulled out my handy dandy yelp mobile app to come to the rescue and found Fuji Sukiyaki.  I was a little nervous coming in due to some mixed reviews, but figured that it as worth a shot.

I was very pleasantly surprised by this sushi spot.  The fish was very fresh, the rolls were delicious and the sashimi was amazing.  I highly recommend the Tuna Poki if you are looking for sashimi with a little more flavor to it.

The only negative was the service - we were one of 4 groups in the entire restaurant, so I was disappointed by how long it took to take our order or get us the check when we were clearly done with our meal.

Aside from that, it was a great meal!<//Text>

< review>
Feels like a small town "mom & pop" shop, from Japan. Never been there, but it feels like a midwestern diner - just not serving midwestern food. I've eaten here several times and not been left down.

Food: Good. I only have their vegan-friendly sushi, but dine here with friends. I've never seen anyone be sad about their sushi. It's consistenly done well and not trying to be fancy.

Staff: Prompt, courteous, not warm per-se, but friendly enough to get the order taken and food delivered.

Atmosphere: LIke I said, mom & pop diner. They also have some traditional seating with rice paper doors. I've never had the pleasure, but it's quaint and does not feel forced.

Always happy to eat here. I don't rave about it to my friends, but it's kinda my mental standard for sushi.<//review>

< review>
2.5 - For a place with sukiyaki in its name, it sure had a distracted menu with sukiyaki buried in a corner. Got the beef sukiyaki for $9.95, but this was the first time it came pre-cooked in a metal bowl, so not really a real sukiyaki experience. Flavors were alright, a bit stingy on the beef, but it came with tofu, cabbage, Shitake mushrooms, and vermicelli. It was almost like eating a nabeyaki udon, except with beef and vermicelli instead of chicken and udon. Came with a bowl of rice and miso soup.

Bento box of tempura and chicken katsu for $7.95, but the batter was thick and not particularly good. Came with miso soup.

Came with Chinese pickled cabbage.

Not busy during lunch, but waitress wasn't attentive. I'm fairly certain this place is Chinese-run. Takes credit. On the outskirt of San Mateo downtown, but I recommend heading into the center for authentic Japanese food.< /review>

I love this Dentist (Baker pediatric dental care) for my children and they love it too! I've searched a lot for a great pediatric dentist and I finally found one! They definitely know how to deal with children, very friendly staff and no long waiting times 😊< /Review>

<text>Great place. Kind people work here. Helpful and attentive. They have a wide drive area. Tall units that are all accessible from outside. So it's easy to unload. We had a full 20 foot truck that was easily unloaded. Thanks again</text>< pictures>

<Review>Diana and Kenny are awesome!! Between the conformation call follow ups, helping me find the right storage unit that would fit my budget and the space I needed, to the paperwork process, they were both so friendly and helpful.
I would highly recommend North Main Storage not just because the location and pricing but the absolute superb customer services as well!!<//Review>< Pictures>

We like the size of the storage 10 x 10 x 10.  We rented a space inside.  It is climate regulated.  Therefore you are comfortable during rainny season and scotching hot weather.  We visited storage regularly downsizing our possesions.  When it was time to move to a smaller space, the staff worked with us to make our move successful.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

Well...... Just recently started renting a unit to clear out some space at home. Bottom line is thorough about the details of the rental...... friendly.... reasonable prices.... very secure facility. But hey some of the perks I didn't mention..... jar of candy in the lobby.... classic rock pumped through the whole facility...... super clean place. And though while signing all the paperwork she will discuss it with you......... a very nice referral discount. So make sure to mention me when you call.< /Text>

I was looking to rent storage for the very first time so I had bunch of questions.  Diane was very helpful in answering all my questions regarding climate control storage unit.  Staff was wonderful in showing me the different size of units.  Facility is very clean.  I liked the shutter type doors. They even have one complementary truck for moving depending on the availability.< /Text>

My Husband and I moved from Idaho in Feb to California. We researched a good storage option, and decided on North Main Street Storage and booked a package through THEIR website. Well when we got there from our 2 day drive from Idaho with all of our things, we show up to the storage unit only to be harassed by the manager (Diana, her name is everywhere. I couldn't forget it if I tried) telling us that the special we had email proof that we received "doesn't exist" and she tried to bully us into paying the full $190 a month for the unit-- which I of course refused and told her she would honor the $80 deal we received. She agreed to do that for 4 months and would put notes into the system so we didn't get charged the full amount. So we moved into our unit.

The following month I called in 4 days before rent was due to pay-- she couldn't find her notes and was insisting I needed to pay the $190 rent. I refused and told her to keep looking. Diana eventually remembered our interaction the month prior so she allowed us to pay the prorated rent and assured me that she would make sure to have notes on our account this time. Then 2 weeks later while in Texas visiting family I get a call from my mother telling me that we got a letter from our storage place and asked if she should open it, I agreed. The letter was a threat for not "paying full rent" telling us they were going to lock us out of our unit if it wasn't paid within a few days. I was livid and called North Main Storage only to get Diana. She tried to convince me I was wrong AGAIN. Then after 20 mins on the phone "found her notes" and assured me we wouldn't be kicked out of our unit.

The following month we were still in Texas (thanks Covid), so I called to pay our rent again. Only to do the exact same thing as the previous month-- down to the threatening letter to remove us from the unit for partial rent.

The 4th and final month we were in our unit, I asked my husband to call and deal with Diana because I was DONE. Of course he calls and gets wonderful, easy going and competent Kenny (couldn't say better things about this guy, he was awesome.) So within 2 mins Kenny found Diana's note about our account and my husband paid for our final month-- no issues.

Then during the 4th and final month my husband and I flew into CA after covid restrictions were lifted to clean out our unit and move our belongings. The first 2 days we were clean it out we had wonderful Kenny, so we weren't harassed. Then on the 3rd day we showed up at 9:10 to our unit (it was supposed to be unlocked by 9am btw) and the units are still locked. My husband left me to try to find Kenny to ask him to let us into the building to clean out our unit, but found and unlocked door on the other side of our building that someone else was using to get into their unit, so he walked through it to open our door so we could access our unit. Well at 9:30 here comes Diana who is accusing us of breaking in... and arguing with my husband as he tries to explain that it was going to 106 degree day so we were hoping to get started early, and since the door on the other side the unit was opened he just walked through. She was so hostile to us. Honestly TERRIBLE customer service. Their units get to like 90 degrees during the day (so much for temp controlled).

We would NEVER store with them again. It was a terrible experience because of their site manager. There facility is nice for a storage place, but not nice enough to be harassed and accused of BS all the time. BEWARE.<//text>

<text>RENTERS BEWARE, DO NOT RENT HERE!!! Rude staff members, prices always rising, and they close their doors 30 minutes before closing. The doors to get into the indoor units are supposed to be open until 7pm. They close early all the time. I show up at 6:25pm - 6:30pm and the doors are locked. I even call them to let them know I’m on my way, please don’t lock up early and they don’t care.  I pay $300 a month for my unit and I can’t access my property because they close early. When I signed a contract to rent here the hours clearly state that they’re open until 7pm. I drive here from a different city and have to turn around with carloads of stuff all the time. The staff “Diana and Jennifer“ are incredibly USELESS and RUDE. One time I pulled up and Diana looked at me and said “not you again”. And this is because I expressed to them that they are contractually obliged to keep their doors open during the agreed hours. I’ve tried to contact the owners several times and I get a call back from a staff member. I DO NOT recommend this storage to anyone. I don’t ever leave reviews, but I can’t consciously not warn people about their unethical behavior.<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None</resp><gmapID>0x809041ccc1f69db9:0xfac3befd9becb67<//gmapID></record>

<text>5 years after taking my stuff and closing out my account I'm being accused of leaving the unit locked. Why am I being gone after FIVE YEARS LATER? You would think that after a few months of delinquency I would be contacted, but nope. No letters, no phone calls, just a bill that's apparently already been sent to collections demanding that I pay HUNDREDS of dollars. I rented here for LESS than a month back in 2015 while I was waiting to move into my new place and when I left I took the lock that I bought from the facility along with the rest of my things and moved on with my life thinking that was that. Now all of a sudden all these years later I'm dealing with this S storm. So rent at your own risk and KEEP YOUR PAPERWORK so if they come after you 5 years from now you'll be able to prove that they're crooks.</text><name>Emily Akers<//name><UserId.>113779936529226173577<//UserId.><gmap_id>0x809041ccc1f69db9:0xfac3befd9becb67</gmap_id><Date>1563752297321<//Date>< Response>

We got there about a hour later and she started our time from when we called in to reserve truck. And her response was it wasn't her fault that we took so long to get there. VERY UNPROFESSIONAL.

Clean, secure, and easily accessible. I surrounded my storage with sticky traps and sprayed monthly,  as a precaution. Never was there any evidence of bugs or rodents.</review>

<Rate>1<//Rate><text>DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THESE CROOKS!!!! This companoes employees robbed me, and stole my unit by not sending me a bill and deceiving/lying to me about my bill die date. I called to get my balance and due date. They told me I would be okay to pay the following monday and there was no auction date  Then when I went to pay my storage on Monday like they imstructed me to, I then learned they sold my unit at auction thr Friday before that Monday. They straight up robbede for all of my Grandma's possessions and my son's possesions. My Grandma had just recently passed , and the North Main grounds keeper at the time had an uneasy interest in the contents of my storage. I wad lied to and robbed. Never would I allow anyone I know to do business with these crooks. Nobody wanted to resolve my issue. I was never contacted back aftwr complaining, and the lady Diana at the front desk was extremely rude. It took a lot for me not to do anything in regards to retribution. Every chance I get I will let people know about these faulty crooks.  DO NOT give them your business!!!!<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None<//response>< gmap_id>

*****DO NOT STORE YOUR STUFF HERE*****
Our stuff got stolen and they could care less. Management hasn't contacted us in anyway! If I owned a business like this I would at-least call the customer! I wouldn't be surprised if it was an inside job. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED DO NOT STORE YOUR STUFF HERE!!!!</text>

<Text>my experience with North Main Storage in Manteca is always pleasant - good customer service, great rates, excellent facility overall. easy location and no-hassle with the contract. as with any rental agreement any where, I'd suggest opting for insurance in case of unforesable events such as water damage etc.< /Text><Rate>5<//Rate>< Date>

<Text>Don't use this storage.. . When moving out my parents and I rented three units. My storage unit was broken into second month I had it. I closed it promptly after but did not pay for the insurance. Three months after that my parents units were also broken into and they lost several valuable items. Now returning to the last unit to clear what we could and make sure there are no more important items in it we found mouse droppings all over the unit. Sadly a few of the employees are nice but it isn't worth the recurring head aches.<//Text><user_name>Kimberly Aguirrie</user_name><Resp>None</Resp>< gmap_id>

Maghen is an excellent hair stylist!  She colored and styled my hair today.  They are all excellent!  Didn't she do a great job, though?  So remember to come to Fantastic Sam's on Melrose Avenue in Vista, CA.  All if their stylists are extremely talented!  Jenn, Adrianne,, Maghen, and Rosie have all worked on my hair and have done a marvelous job.  There are a couple other stylists at this site, but they haven't all worked on my hair, yet, but I know that anyone who works at this particular Fantastic Sam is the best! Koo no</Review>

<review>First experience my hair turned out a disaster but Adrian, the manager, went out of her way to ensure my hair was fixed properly, looked great and was honest on what she thought was best treatment for my hair. Not concerned about making more money. I appreciate the honesty, even though I was unable to get the highlights I wanted she explained she cared more about damaging my hair at that time. She welcomed me to come back every month to try a strand test again until my hair is able to tolerate the treatment. That meant more above all else.<//review><Rate>4</Rate></record></dataset><record>

Alexa is amazing! She fixed my badly dyed hair from an amateur at another salon. She is super friendly and accommodating. She's very professional and works very hard. I will definitely be back!<//review>

Was pleasantly surprised by good color and highlights. They seem to be very tentative about their cuts though. Whenever I have asked for 3+ inches off or for pronounced layers, they don't seem to do all that much to make the difference I was asking for.< /review>

Location was very convenient and close to home.  After returning,  stylists aren't very friendly, if they are busy they don't know how to figure out wait times or offer suggestions of what might work for them. This happened on several occasions I attempted to get a haircut, I just stopped bothering at this location.< /Review>< Pictures>

<response>None<//response><Review>I got a voucher from groupon so I called before coming in to make an appointment for a haircut but the lady told me that I could just do walk-in. Went there, saw a couple people before me so I decided to check-in assuming that the waiting list isn't that long but later on, a few people came in and I found out that they had appointments so I had to wait for more than an hour. My stylist, Rosie, did a pretty decent job with my haircut tho so the star is for her. If I didn't have the voucher, I won't go here. Never again.< /Review>< time>

Haircut was ok. What I could not stand was listening to the stylists personal situations, clothing and eating habits. I go to get my hair cut. Light mutual conversation is appreciated. When the conversation is only about the stylists personal issues it becomes uncomfortable. I will not go back.< /Review>

If I could give less than one star I would. This establishment is completely unprofessional. The manager working there is so rude, degrading and racist. She completely ignored my elderly 70 year old grandmother when she came in to complain about one of the establishments hair dressers completely messing up her hair then had the audacity to tell her very rudely I might add too, that it was her fault for choosing that hair cut. She's 70 years old! Have some respect & understanding. And then after my grandma & I were leaving she slammed the door in our face after refusing to fix my grandma's hair. Will never go back to this establishment again with this kind of unprofessional, extremely rude management running the business.< /Text>

Got mine and my husband’s haircut yesterday at this place. Adriana did a very great job. I went there with a superlong freezy unmanageable hair. Came out with so much of confidence and happiness. She understood my needs and did not rush it through the end. She chopped all the freezy hair and gave beach curly looks, which I loved a lot. Adriana you rocked it.< /review>

7E2-20B: Went there few more times since the first visit. Those visits were normal and I got good haircuts. Also, I like their coupons which come in the weekly grocery ad mails. Based on this I changed the rating to 4 stars.
First visit (1 star): Went there around 4pm and they close at 5pm, but they told me they are not taking any more customers for the day. Store seemed empty to me. I went to another store in the area and got the haircut.<//Review>

<Review>ABSOLUTELY WORST place EVER to get a haircut!!! I went in earlier this afternoon for them to trim my bangs. Worst bang trim ever!!! She was super lazy! She made my bangs look in between straight across and side-swept. The part that is supposed to look straight is completely crooked! Looks as if though she used a lawn-mower. Never going back there again that's for sure. And she's the manager there! Even worse! You make the rest of your salon look bad. And learn how to properly chew gum. You and your hairstylists look like damn cows!!! I'll make sure not to refer anyone there. That's a promise!!!<//Review>< Pictures>

I showed up to my appointment and they told me it would cost an additional $45+ to color my hair. Which is close to the cost of the groupon that I already purchased. Might as well pay the extra cost and go to a professional who won't charge you more money.< /review>< pics>

It's a great hole in the wall place for Hawaiian food. When you order, it will take probably about 10 to 15 minutes to be ready. We ordered the family deal with rice, macaroni salad, barbecue beef, barbecue chicken, and katsu chicken.</review>

<text>I'm pretty particular about loco moco, musubi and macaroni salad which is why I love going here. The musubi is grilled and served with that good sauce. The katsu always has generous portions and the macaroni salad is typically heavy with mayo but not so much it makes it disgusting. They have definitely found a good balance!<//text>< pics>

The BBQ was overcooked and tough to eat, while the seafood was dry. Overall, the food lacked flavour.</Review>

We dined here many times throughout the years and we tried all the chicken, beef and seafood rice plates and it's consistently delicious and full of flavor. The macaroni salad is just as tasty.

The lady working the cash register is always smiling and very pleasant. Prices are reasonable and the dining area is very simple and clean.</text>

< Review>
The chicken katsu musubi is good here. The portions are pretty good for the price. I'm not sure why there are photos of L&L barbecue stuff but I've already reported to Google that this is not the place. Still, the food is good.< /Review>

<Review>Its OK, but meals are smaller than on pictures. On regular portion they give only 2 spoons of rice.  They charge 0.75 $ for soda. When woman cooking its better when the only man(his cashier too). Cheap guys, not very cheap lunches...< /Review>< Pics>

Stopped by the place was a ghost town. I ordered spam musubi and when i went to pay the lady said there was a $10 minimum when using a card. Told her thanks but no thanks. Started to walk out when she said ok ok there's a 10cent fee. I thought about what just happened. Not today. Food ok.</text>

When I googled for the closest L&L Hawaiian BBQ nearby, this popped up as the closest. This isn't even an L&L chain (trying to tell google about it atm)? I called and had a hard time placing my order with the woman (she didn't speak proper english) that picked up the phone. I did the take out option. I ordered the BBQ mix plate and BBQ chicken plate.

Their food tastes similar to L&L but I would prefer L&L for the following reasons...
1. More quantity for your money (They provide more vegetables and rice on the side at L&L) than this plc.
2. This plc charges $1.50 to change the macaroni side to vegetables.

This plc also sells doughnuts on the side. So when you walk in, it has a little funky set up.</Text>

Get a pole. Find a spot. Take up whitling perhaps. Its beautiful along the creek. Watch out fer them " clothing optional" folks though. They give a whole new meaning to a bear in the woods.</Review>

I like prospecting here, but watch your back. The campgrounds have their share of tweakers who use the creek as a bathroom. Sad< /Text>

< review>
Great variety of items but the customer service is not so great 😕 there was only one register open meanwhile 2 employees stood around looking for something to do. The cashier that was open was great she was wrapping every glass the customer was purchasing but they had over 30 different glass pieces so it was going to take her time and neither one of the other employees tried to help. The line didn't move for over 5min and there was more than 6 people already waiting in line but they didn't even look worried.< /review>

I sliced my finger on a metal flower, small but still bleed a bit. Deeper than I thought.  Told manager seemed like she didn't care. Cashier had more empathy.</text>

This is by far the cleanest, most organized dollar tree I've been in. The aisle ways are not jam packed and you can actually navigate around easily. Great lighting too. The selection of merchandise was really good and I could find what I needed easily.<//text>

The overall appearance of the store was excellent. Main reason for me to return will be for the fact that hopefully Christine will be my cashier again. She has a bright and shiny personality. It’s refreshing to see that this day and age. Thank you Christine for your excellent service and personality. See you soon!!!</Text>

There's items here for $1 that are $2-$3 elsewhere. Good place to shop on a budget and still get some name brands.< /Text>

<Text>As I was shopping with my two young children (1 and 4), we got to hear how horrible another employee was. Many many f bombs loud enough to hear a few isles over. Needless to say I was shocked and unpleased when I walked past the two employees who didn't even bother to atleast lower thier voices as I walked by with my kids.< /Text>< rating>

Although everything is of course well priced their selection is a bit less robust as 99 cent stores.< /text>

We feel we received more than just a great water system from Daniel and Albert at Lifetime Solutions. The care and professionalism with the installation of our system, was above and beyond . They were efficient, courteous, and clean. I would recommend their service to anyone. Thank you so much for your service.<//text>

Today we had our water system serviced. Ray was our technician. He was very thorough and gave me answers for questions I was going to ask. He was very informative. And demonstrated all the work he was doing. There was nothing left uncovered. He did not leave until we were satisfied with our service. I appreciate everything that he did and all the information he gave. I wish more technicians were as considerate and thoughtful as this man. I would hope to get him as our technician next time we need service.< /review>

The two guys that showed up we're very professional and clean with the removal of my water softener system. They showed me why it's a great choice to choose rain soft as your go to company for better water in the house. I am very happy with how everything worked out. The front office new I was limited in time because we are moving and didn't want to leave the system they got me an appointment the next day. Thank you to everyone at rain soft I look forward to have clean water for the lifetime of my system which sounds like forever lol. Thank you again.<//Text>

Great service. Josh knew what to do and even mounted the canisters on the side under the sink so they are easier to unscrew and replace filters. Very clean and made sure I had the correct pressure on the osmosis. Would definitely recommend!!<//text>

We do not like this company.   When we originally purchased they did not tell us the maintenance cost of this system; every year is about $300+ to maintain.   We just put out over $500 to change out filters; every 3 year cycle + the annual stuff.  Also they refuse to correct an electric wire that they splice we is exposed to the elements & remains unsafe because it is a live wire.  We have kids & we continue to be worried for their safety.  Lastly, when the put the system in the needed an outside outlet.  We have one, with two outlets.  Their connection covers both outlets, rendering outside power source useless..
We originally asked them to change it to a 4 outlet but they refused. We WILL NEVER ENDORSE THIS COMPANY!!</text>

Our tech was great and he knew his stuff. They have done a great job in maintaining our old Rainsoft system. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that to come to Los Angeles from Victorville they charge a $145 'Trip Charge'. I realize it's a 2 hour drive but that seems excessive. I could have waited a while until they had more service calls in LA and paid a smaller trip fee.<//Text>

The service man, Chad was extremely polite and courteous. He explained everything he was doing and got the drinking water and the water softener running again. He also called prior to his arrival to verify the appointment time.

I am very pleased with the service from Lifetime Solutions and Chad.<//text>

Their technician didn’t show up on the date of an appointment. I already took a day off from work. Wondering if they have a “real” store, so I drove from my home in Long Beach, CA to Victorville, CA. I’d found out that they indeed have a “real” service. They waive my first hour of service, which is good.
It cost me more than thousand dollars just to re-installed the equipment.
The technician didn’t want to test the HPWater,
his reason for not doing it because he’s an installer not a service person. I don’t know what is the difference ??
Asked him twice if he already set the alarm off, he said he did, but the alarm still making a noise sounds. My neighbor complained !!
I will call them again next week, since their service department didn’t call me back when I called them a couple of days ago.
Hard to reach their service department.
Just wishing good luck for future customers.< /review>

< Review>
9/28/2020
Approximately 18 months ago, my husband canceled our service plan for which we were paying a monthly fee. Around that time, the company stopped their courtesy reminders to schedule maintenance. However, they did NOT inform us of this change in practice. Our bank continued to issue auto-payments to the company. When I performed an audit I found that the company continued to cash our checks despite not delivering any services.

I called mid-July and left a message with customer service but didn't hear back until they noticed I had stopped payments. Then I had their attention. *Three weeks later* (in early August)I received a call back. The service agent I spoke with said that she could put me back on the courtesy reminder call list. Mind you, I was *never informed* that I was removed from the list in the first place! Also we had already cancelled services. Conveniently, she could not find any documentation of the cancellation. During all my interactions I have not been able to get an email address when I call the company number.

They put the responsibility for asking for services back on the consumer after selling us a "discounted" maintenance plan. Then, the company could not find any documentation of our cancellation, so in order to obtain a refund, the service agent said she would have to forward the request to her supervisor. Approximately 6 weeks later, I have not heard back from the agent. But guess what? I received another bill even after I was assured that my account was closed.

So I call back yet again and speak to another agent who sees all the notes in my account confirming my account of the events. She cancels the most recent bill, but I have yet to hear back from the company regarding the prior payments accepted without services rendered. You would think that if a customer had not received services for more than 18 months, they would at least call to check in, rather than just continue to cash the checks.

I recognize the shared responsibility on our end. I am hoping the company will do the right thing and issue a refund for the service fees collected after services ceased.

I will update this review as events proceed.

Update 10/1/20:
I received a call from the accounting department to let me know that they agreed to a partial refund of the checks that they cashed. I will receive approximately 2/3 of the funds mistakenly paid to the company.
This resolution is satisfactory. I am increasing my rating of this company from 1 to 3 stars.< /Review>

My doctor told me to try and start drinking Alkaline water. We have had the system for almost one year. We have had the repair guys out here three times , and that's because we have waited weeks for them to come out. The system has never worked properly, the water comes out in drops in the kitchen. Everytime they come out change the filter and they leave , they say it should start working about a day or two. Nope, it does not work! They said it's the city problem called the city they said they water is coming in fine. I did not have a piping problem until they installed their system. Calling in and getting a appointment is a whole train wreck. We have schedule appointment three different times and all three time they have either forgot about the appointment, didn't have an appointment or best one....I made the appointment with the actual service guys and told him please don't come in the morning we had our son's graduation that day. He said that he will write that on the order and that he will remember because he was the one that was coming out...they called before we were leaving....to let us know they were coming at the time I told them not to come. So they pushed out the appointment again three weeks out!  I wished my husband and I would have seen these reviews before we this company. We were comfortable in the fact that they were backed up by Home Depot. Unfortunately, I wished we have never bought this system.< /Text>

My Rainsoft system had been serviced by various techs for months, yet remained with several major problems. It would not regenerate itself, it wouldn't calculate the daily water usage, the water produced by the system was hard and the resign was failing.

When Mike arrived to check out the system he immediately identified the problems and went to work to fix them. It was very apparent he had years of know how and experience by how quickly he knew what was wrong and how he described to me what was causing the issues with my system. He then took his time to clearly and plainly explain how he planned to rectify them.

He methodically went through the entire mechanics of the device and replaced the expired resign and nearly a dozen failed and/or failing parts, - issues overlooked by the previous techs. He even explained the importance of charcoal added to the resign due to the harmful effects of chlorine added to city water.

After putting everything back together, he tested the water and found it to have (2) grains of hardness. He told me the system was capable of producing (0) grains of hardness and he would continue to work on it till it did. Mike discovered a very important little "O" ring was missing from the top of the large gold filter that was replaced several months earlier.  He installed a new O ring and retested the water. It was Perfect, "0" grains of hardness!

I can"t remember the last time a serviceman had so much pride in his work as Mike did!  I certainly hope the company he works for takes full advantage of this man's knowledge and people skills by utilizing him to oversee others in the field to ensure this level of service- which will cut down on unneeded return trips and disappointments.

A very satisfied customer

Absolutely horrible customer service!! We sold our home and wanted to take our unit with us so we scheduled an appointment for an uninstall and reinstall weeks in advance. The day of the appointment comes and this company wants us to reschedule even though they know that the house has been sold and we will no longer have access to it after the close date. They kept us on hold for over a half hour only AFTER we threatened legal action and they conceded to an uninstall for the day of our appointment, 3 hours later than the original time. Service tech comes out almost 45 minutes late, uninstalls the unit and then wants to leave without actually moving the unit. We place another call, only to be told that they have other clients that they need to service - we had to remind them that they are speaking to a client that had an original appointment that had been confirmed. Completely ridiculous company!<//Text>

<name>N Littlefield< /name><Time>1581461130666< /Time><rating>1<//rating><text>This company has been very consistent about collecting payment for the system they sold us, but very inconsistent about scheduling services. We purchased salt multiple times when the system got low, only to have them tell us at a much later time that we can request a salt drop off. Truthfully, if they would make the calls to schedule appointments as they did when we first had the system installed, we would probably never run out. I would not recommend anyone use this company unless you enjoy paying for a service you aren't going to receive. In addition, we were told on set up that we would have our system serviced "quarterly", and upon calling today, apparently they believe quarterly means "three times a year", which upon further research, they have not even met that standard.< /text>< Pictures>

<Review>I have their water softener system and water filtration system for about two years now. I have had nothing but problems with the system. It all started when I purchased the system for 6 thousand bucks. The initial install took 3 weeks, it was poorly installed and did not work. They worked on the system for a year or so and finally got it too work to at least to my satisfaction. Turns out they over pressured my system and ended up with leaking pipes at my cost to my contractor.

The salesman orginally lied to me by stating full money back guarantee if system could not work on my Ranch. I went ahead and asked to have system removed and refund my money. I was denied.

The filters are past due to be changed by 4 months and I have not heard from them. So, not sure of quality of water at this time.

Currently the system works sometimes and sometimes it does not. Water is soft, then it's not. Goes in phases.

I have decided to remove the system and take a $6000 loss not including cost of repairs from damages this system has cause before more damage is done.

Many of the employees and technicians are great, but its is in my opinion the owner/managers could careless about their customers. Seems they want the sell and that's it. I have also caught their dispatch employees straight up lie to me.

I did find out later you can purchase similar system installed for about $4500 less than what I paid. It truly sickened me when I found out.

I simply recommend seeking another company  than this one if you are looking for a water treatment system especially if you are on a well with water storage and boost pump.

Lastly, the salesman told me I would use 4 to 6 bags of salt per year. When system works, I use 4 bags between 2 weeks and a month at 6 bucks a bag.</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None</Response>< Gmap_id>

<Text>Martin was extremely knowledgeable of the system.  He was thorough in checking everything out , making sure my water system was in perfect working condition and that all my questions were answered.  He was friendly and understanding when I was a little late to get home.  He made sure I was completely satisfied with everything before he left.  It's also nice to know that he owns the system as well, not just works for them. I am extremely happy with this investment.

<Review>Horrible! Asher and Arielle are terrible managers/trainers. They lie on what they pay. Treat employees like trash. Absolutely the worst thing to go for EVER! I personally believe rainsoft is fraud. They hire tweakers who cause disruption. They do NOT CARE about anyone at all. They also have cameras in the company vehicle and do not let you know you are being recorded! BBB has been informed. Do not go there!!!</Review>< pics>

Not sure what to say.. I was happy at first water was making my skin feel great, all of a sudden my skin is so dry and eczema is bad..i haven't had any problems with my skin in about 20 years. I only had the system for a little over a month now.. Not sure if it was worth the 7,000.. They say if it ain't broke don't fix it.<//review>

<Rating>2</Rating><text>The initial set-up was a breeze....until we find out that getting financed through Home Depot have certain stipulations/requirements, may I add, none of which was explained to us prior to or during the sell and signage. The lady, Ruth, who is handling our account is terribly rude and obnoxious! She began to explain she had surgery on her ear, is sick, and have been off work for a month - so, that’s why no one has followed up with us and she knows that’s not “our problem”! Her guilt trip was insane and every time I attempted to speak - she cut me off. On the later end of somewhat conversing, she apologized saying “I’m sorry I called you at the end of my shift, I’m tired/exhausted, sick, and I’m sorry I kept cutting you off while you were speaking”. Regardless of her apology, she needs to be reported and penalized for her lack of customer service! This has been by far 1 of my worst customer services experience!<//text></record></dataset><record>

I don't usually take the time to write these. But in this case with all this employee had to deal with,  I had to make the time because he definitely deserves some praise. James went above and beyond the call of duty to make sure we got the best service ever.  He was not going to leave until the job was completed  perfectly. Since we have an older model he came up against some challenges which he handled each one with expertise, patience , and determination to fix each problem. I appreciated that he informed me of what I needed to know and educated me on the process and care of our water softener. Even though he ran up against a time crunch he always maintained a calm and pleasant attitude. James is someone with integrity, someone you can trust and count on to get the job done  to perfection. He closed the service call with informing me of the new product available that we could upgrade too that would save us money in the long run. I would say he covered all his bases perfectly. And I hope he is always the one to take care of our future needs. He is definitely a huge asset to the Lifetime Solutions Inc.
Thank you so much James, for a job very well done!</Review>

They left the work areas cleaner than they were upon their arrival.

He fixed the problem and even asked if there was anything else he can do. Fernando, was very professional, knowledgeable  and really loved what he does.

<Review>We were not satisfied after year two with our Rainsoft system. Independent analysis proved it was not what we thought we had purchased.
We are sent Fernando to look at our issue. He was able to communicate with us and not only explain but after making adjustments to our system, it is working the way we expected. He was patient and made sure the system was doing what it’s capable of doing.
He is terrific at what he does. He is the only person I want servicing our system

<Review>This company will con you into getting a water test and promises you 2 gift cards with no purchase necessary or regardless of what water filtration you have at home. I was approached by a home depot employee that offered me a water test for 2 gift cards. I told him I have a reverse osmosis and a water softener, he said no problem. There is no purchase necessary and I still get the 2 gift cards just for the water test. The tech showed up at my home and did the water test, he seen that my water was good, and seen the reverse osmosis and water softener. He told me he couldn't give me the gift cards. That I should call the Company, I called and requested my gift cards, but up till now they have just ignored me. Don't fall for this water test, your being conned to by their equipment.</Review><Rate>1</Rate><Resp>{'time': 1560206779580, 'text': "Hi Rick.

Martin G. was my service man from Lifetime Solutions. Martin G came to my house yesterday to replace my carbon filter.  He greeted me with a smile and was a joy to have him in my home.  I put in an order for the carbon filter attached to my water softener but he had an order for a system I didn't have.  No worries though, he stepped up and professionally did what was needed.  He cleaned up the area where he worked and left everything better than when he found it.<//review>

<Review>Jim gave me much  needed  information that wasn't  given to me when I had the system installed. If I had been even given  this information when the system was installed I could of avoided replacing the filter that is suppose to last 3 to 5 years.

He showed me what to do when salt is added & how to update the system,  and how flush the filters at the sink. I give Jim 5 Stars He was very pleasant and very nice to talk to.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None< /Resp><GmapID>0x80c365b27ffa6e9d:0x170ab597b8a1762f</GmapID></record>

<Text>We purchased our water system about 3 years ago. We recently moved and took our system with us. We had a hiccup with the reinstallation, however, they did everything they possibly could to make it right and we are very happy. We will definitely work with them again in the future! If you have a problem, they will make it right. That alone makes us a customer for life.</Text>< Pics>

<Text>Excellent Job.  Jim gave me a good education on how the in house filters, tank and valve work and the need to change the valve and drain tank. He was personable and quick.  And he advised me I did NOT need a new filter, saving me $i60.00.  Pretty good, I would say.< /Text>< UserId.>

He's the type of employee to give a company a good name. I hope all your employees are the same, I know that if he's coming to my home I'm going to get  professional service. And someone who is personable and able to answer  questions. And you don't feel like you're being talked at your being talked to. Good job< /Review>

< Review>
The service sucks. I had the techs out here a few times cause last summer I burned myself. Yup I do not have cold water as soon as the summer starts. Now it’s summer again and I will not have cold water again. Their insolation is a joke. They think cause you are a female they can treat you how ever they want. Ignoring is one thing they can do best as long as they sell.
Ohhh and when they tell you about hair. Not true.
Lies, lies, lies
I asked for the manager to call me. He never did. Of course. Ohh and there is more. I could write a book. I am very patient but enough is enough</Review>

< Review>
I like the filtered water, but I think the company needs to take measures to capture all the water that is wasted in the installation process and the filter services. Setting up a gray water system for all the water being wasted through the regular filtration and flushing would also help. Had I foreseen so much water waste, I would not have gone with a water softener system. Drought or no drought, we can't afford to waste water. Stepping off my soapbox...Fernando was great and explained everything he was doing and what I should do to maintain my system.</Review>

Ray did such a good job beside the heat and the long commute he was patient and showed me the steps on how to change the filter myself.I think if the company hired more peoplease like him, it would be great. I would recommend this solely based on the fact that ray did a great job and sometimes customer service does okay.< /Text>

Hector arrived at the stated time, performed a thorough inspection of my soft water system, and made appropriate adjustments all while explaining his actions.

Hugo was very professional and definitely knew what needed to be done.  He made sure the system was running perfectly after the work was complete.</Review>

<Text>I was absolutely impressed from the moment I met Rain Soft's representative, Mr. Martin Gonzales. He not only explained what he had done in the maintenance of our system, but he actually cleaned the exterior components (over and beyond the call of duty). I feel compelled to recommend to anyone who may be in need of a water system to mention "Rain Soft".< /Text>< pictures>

<review>Staff is friendly and always seems to be helpful. My only complaint is that being that I live in mountains they only service once a month. When I moved up here is was hard to get a scheduled service to get my system reinstalled. My husband is only off on Mondays, they did try work around his schedule.
The problem was after the system was installed it wasn't working. Water was coming out black from the charcoal. Installer said it would go away, after a day my husband called back. Something was wrong with system and they needed to come back out. Well...because we live in the mountains they will only come out once a month. Doesn't matter what it is and so the system we just paid almost $500 to be installed had to be turned off until they could come next month.
I have to say I was much happier when they were still Rain Soft. Their level of service is not the same or even as good as it was then. It's not bad, but it's not impressive either.
And since I've moved, which I realize I chose to live  in the mountains, I'm disappointed in the service I've received so far. My view might be different if I still lived down the hill, but the fact of the matter is I don't. And having paid to have my system reinstalled to make sure it was done right and it still not working, then be told I have a wait a month for it to be looked at because they only come up once a month. And of course the scheduled day is a different day than Monday so someone has to take off work.</review><gmap_id>0x80c365b27ffa6e9d:0x170ab597b8a1762f< /gmap_id><Response>None<//Response>< Pics>

Jim was my technician. He went through every  process with me. I'm definitely going to request him to be my tech every time it's time for service. The first tech that came out was at my house for 15 minutes. He didn't do all the inspections that Jim did. Jim on the other hand, was at my house for about an hour. He told me that the service that he did today, was how it's supposed to be done. Now I know in the future what to expect.<//Text>

We recently had our unit serviced by Hector Tovar, he's always on time, he's honest and always very polite. he's very detailed on the work he does and also lets you know what's needed for the next visit.
I know what type of service I'm getting when I know Hector will be performing the work.
Life Time Solutions, if you have an employee of the month, Hector gets my vote!< /text>

<text>My water was the worst I've ever had left the white calcium marks all over the fence and very hard. With the softener and purifier it's much better. LOVE the way they do the cleaning products. Everything is plant based environmentally safe. They send you the non-deluded concentrate and the empty plastic bottle already marked for adding water to mix that you use over & over so they are not shipping any water to you. Powdered cleaners have no added fillers to make it weigh more so you pay more. It's great.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None<//response>< Gmap_id>

<Review>We recently had our unit serviced by Hector Tovar, he's always on time, he's honest and always very polite. he's very detailed on the work he does and also lets you know what's needed for the next visit.
I know what type of service I'm getting when I know Hector will be performing the work.
Life Time Solutions, if you have an employee of the month, Hector gets my vote!<//Review>< userid>

I'm definitely going to request him to be my tech every time it's time for service. The first tech that came out was at my house for 15 minutes. He didn't do all the inspections that Jim did. Jim on the other hand, was at my house for about an hour. He told me that the service that he did today, was how it's supposed to be done. Now I know in the future what to expect.< /Review>< pics>

Our Lifetime Solutions water system is wonderful! We've had it for one year, and an automatic check up service was scheduled to change the filters, etc. A service pro, Mike Martin, came to our home on time, and provided us with a fast and courteous service! Thank you Mike Martin! & thanks to Lifetime Solutions!</Review>

Mr. Jim from the company was was very informative and thorough with the process. He took time to teach the use of the water filteration system and also how to use the mini computer on the system. He took time to check for possible leakages around the drinking water purifier and explained the process of water purification.

I am sure that our family has clean and soft water 24 hours.<//review>< Pics>

<Review>This visit was much more enjoyable than our previous experiences.  The service was great and our service tech martin made it that way.   Once I finally got through to the service dept, I spoke with Michelle.  She was rushed at first, but then after cracking a joke, we both laughed and then I was much more happier with her service.  Not only did she answer my questions, she explained every service, when it was due and how much it would be. Round of applause for these two!</Review>< Pictures>

Well, funny this should pop up for review. I've been waiting ,thinking that I haven't had a service call. So I called &  ask about it. I was told that those who don't pay a monthly fee for service every 3months are pushed to the back for a service call. I was told that they have over 1000 calls to make and not enough help. REALLY. I've had my softener and reverse osmosis for 20 plus years, and have paid every year for a service call. Talk about feeling like I've been punched !!! It's been 18mo's since my last service call. It says to me their old customers don't count... We old customers are what helped their  business to grow.. JUST SAYING, I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED. Now I will make sure I call myself every year.<//review>

<review>The sales person was very professional, and spent a lot of time explaining the whole system, and demonstrating the quality of my water; very poor. I had a service call, water seemed murky. The technician was great tested the water, showed me I wasn't rinsing enough, and assured me all was well with my system. I bought the under the sink water purification system as well as the soft water one. It's nice to be able to drink great tasting water right from the tap, and I'm saving a bundle on soap, and detergent as well. An added benefit is that I've haven't had any more stops up in the kitchen sink as the soft water actually stops build up in the pipes, and even takes out the deposits already in them over time. This was one of my main reasons for buying the system, as I don't want to have to re-pipe my 25 year old home.
It is pricey, but I feel well worth it in the long run.</review>< gmap_id>

<rating>1< /rating><Text>I have been a loyal customer. I have had the water softener and under sink water filter since 2003. I have been part of the service program since 2010.   Unfortunately, I have decided to take my service elsewhere.  My calls go unanswered - the service manager's name changes every time I call and the office manager cannot be bothered to call me back either.

My under sink water filter stopped working about four weeks after my service appointment in early September.  I called and after some discussion (because my three month appointment is in November) got an appointment October 7 - my day off - to have someone come out and fix it. The day came and went with no service.  When I called Monday, I was informed there was no appointment made.  I asked to speak to the manager named Ruben who said he could have someone there Friday, October 24. I told him it would have to be after 3, he said he'd make a note of it.  Friday came and when the service tech called to confirm, he told me he couldn't come after 3 because it was his early day.  I called the office and spoke to Denae who said that Greg or maybe it was Gordon (I was given both names) was out of the office for lunch.  She took my message and assured me he would call me back.  No one has called me back.

I am not waiting anymore. I am replacing my system with another company.  I am very unhappy that a loyal customer would be treated this way.  If you notice, all the reviews are about the service techs and what a great job they have done.  They are trying to build up the good reviews to counter the lousy service in the office.  Once they have your money, they don't care about you.</Text>< Pics>

Scammy business practices. They will call you non-stop to try to get someone in your home to sell you a water softener. Unfair practices to their employees, like. They don't try to sell you anything if you are "Arab or Asian." If you want a water softener you are better off buying one yourself and having it installed by a contractor or plumber.</text>

I’m sorry to say I got one of these systems only to not get it to work right from the start, now they want to charge me a service fee to get it working right and they are expensive at everything they do, which I feel we should of been told how much they would charge after the initial set up, another thing they don’t tell you is that they get the system and installation on a loan with a high interest rate which gets attached to your house as a lean until you finish paying for it thru Prefered Credit which is a credit card company so please think twice before dealing with these people they are NOT HONEST!< /Review>

Jim was my service guy and he was super helpful.  Not only did he explain how to identify if my Air master was working correctly, but he helped me with some other issues I was having with my water system.  He took the time to go through the water system computer and explain the process of how it filters, what kind of salt I need to buy, and how to navigate through the computer if I had problems.  He was super helpful and professional.  He even checked my water pressure when he was done.  I have had my fair share of repair guys that just repair stuff and don't take the time to explain things to customers, but I am impressed with Jim and Lifetime Solutions of how they stand behind their product and give good customer service.  I would reccommend this company to anyone looking for a water or air system.   Thanks Jim!!</review>< time>

< Review>
I installed a whole house Rainsoft water conditioning system about 3 years ago and I have been very satisfied.  Barstow water is heavily chlorinated and contains a lot visible gunk (mainly calcium & magnesium salts) that stick to everything (tubs, pipes, coffee pots etc).  It may indeed be safe to drink but I simply did not want to.  My Rainsoft system has fixed all that with a minimum of required maintenance attention on my part.  Further, the annual maintenance visits by Lifetime Solutions have been pleasant, informative & promptly completed.<//Review>

Excellent Service by Lifetime Solutions, Inc our Technican Jim McGarry provided terrific technical knowledge of the Rainsoft system. He was very professional and friendly. Jim offered tips to use our system at the highest efficiency. He was running a bit late and gave a status call of his later arrival. Appreciated that courtesy.  We love out system as well as any house guests we have over.
We recommend Lifetime Solutions, Inc., and the Rainsoft system< /review>

We had a water line leak under the kitchen sink area.  Mr. Martin Gonzales from Lifetime Solutions was very professional and responsive when he came to our home.   He fixed our leak and restored our osmosis water system.  We will ask for him again if we ever have any problems! Thank you again.</text>

<Time>1485807836305<//Time><rating>1</rating><text>Went for a group interview on the 27th btw my submitted resume was "lost" by hr (brought one with me to the interview), 20 people showed up needless to say they only hired 8. We were "interviewed" I guess you could say...No real questions asked he just talked about the company. During the interview the boss Roy talked about fellow employees as well going on to say how certain employees just goofed off and wasted time. Also that there was a top ranking telemarketer on the job but nothing was special about her. He also stated that if we liked Amazon (warehouse work) or Medical Office work then this wasn't the job for us.  Very UNPROFESSIONAL! And discriminating as well. So im guessing they hired the people dressed in non interview attire who stumbled over their scripts. ☺🙂</text>< Pictures>

<review>i was initially very unhappy with lifetime since after every time we had our system serviced, something would inevitably go wrong (acidic drinking water, violent shaking of the spout when we accessed our drinking water, and at one point, no drinking water coming out at all).  I was over it until Henry came out and fixed all the problems. What a difference!!< /review>< user>

Lifetime solutions water softener company came out to hook up my reverse osmosis system after a kitchen remodel and the technician asked if it would be ok to install a leak detection/shutoff under the sink just in case there ever was a leak I thought it was a good idea so we did hoping we would never need it. Fast forward 8 months, my in house water pressure regulator shot  my water pressure up from 80 psi to 100 psi and boom one of my filters under the sink blew up sending water everywhere until the leak detector shut of the water. Called Lifetime Solutions they came out the next day fixed the problem under the sink ordered  a new pressure regulator installed it the next day and we are up and running without needing to find a plumber and possibly being without water for days.< /Review>
