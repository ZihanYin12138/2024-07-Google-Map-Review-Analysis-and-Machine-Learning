<Review>The process of getting set up for aligners was easy and the staff was super friendly and helpful. My daughter wants to get rid of crowding that happened from not wearing her retainers for a few ears after regular braces. We got a blue light teeth whitening system as part of the package, too. Price is way lower than regular ortho. We’re happy!</Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

I had been contemplating on setting up my appointment for almost 6 months. I finally went online and setup a same day appointment. I was welcomed in by Jamie at the Redwood city store. She was very polite and communicated everything that I would be doing at my appointment. She made me feel very much as ease. She made sure that I Express  my concerns during this one-time 3D scan visit. That to me was very important because at first, I was a bit shy but she knew how to make me feel at ease. I would recommend Smile Direct Club to anyone who is looking to brighten their smile with people who really care about you.<//Review>

Today I got my 3D scan done by Gayle at the RWC location. She was very professional and helpful! She made my experience there so much better and answered all of my questions! Superb customer service and I just wanted to say thank you for being awesome! I can’t wait to start my journey with Smile Direct Club :)<//Review>

They just ask you a few questions and then take 3D prints of your teeth which is pretty cool to see the true position of your teeth. My smileguide Stephanie P. was super nice and walked me through everything and made my experience better by making me feel comfortable jumping into straightening my teeth in a more convenient way (plus I got a free whitening kit).<//Review>< Rate>

Wonderful experience.

The staff is very helpful and informative and they made me feel welcome from the moment I stepped in. The 3D scan with Gayle was a quick and easy process and was very cool to see!

I definitely recommend this place for anyone needing a good place to start and is looking for cheaper alternatives. They double check everything and make sure you’re set to go before you leave, answering any/all questions you may have.

10/10 highly recommend!< /Text>

<Review>Such an amazing experience from booking, to my appointment, to receiving my aligners. Thank you so much to Gayle for providing the best customer service and having such a thorough knowledge of the Smile Direct aligners. Gayle answered all of my questions and was really patient with me as I was kind of nervous about the system. I've had past troubles with oral care as a kid/teenager so as an adult I was a little scared to try something new. Gayle made me feel supported and honestly really excited to start this new smile journey. Thank you again!

<Time>1559269197036</Time><Review>There were 3 appointments that were scheduled at the same time and only one dentist available. The team was proactive and called before hand to try and get me to come in earlier which I appreciated however I felt rushed in the chair during my scan. I was already committed to the purchase but if the prices didn’t go up after 5/31 then I would have for sure asked to come back another time when they weren’t rushing to get to the next person.< /Review>< resp>

< review>
They couldn’t/refused to tell me about my gum recession problem, and my periodonist told me their 5-month treatment plan would only worsen my situation. I even sent them the letter and report from periodonist. He said if I carried forward with the aligners my situation could be disastrous! Smiles Direct Club asked me to ship back aligners for a refund but refused to be responsible for shipping costs because it’s their “policy”. How could they justify having customers pay for shipping back something useless and harmful? I called many times and they failed to provide me with a helpful response. Today I reached out to their dental team and they honestly told me their scans are actually incapable of detecting other dental issues, and that my case really shouldn’t have been approved.< /review>

<review>I made my first appointment through the website, which was easy. I originally walked past the store but its actually located in 'Sola Salon Studios' which is a kind of mall for multiple beauty businesses. It is very clean and welcoming inside.

I was assisted by Gayle, who was very warm and friendly. I actually work for a dental lab so I had alot of questions that she was able to answer or was able to direct me to a way of finding my answer.

The procedure was easy and quite fun, actually.

I was there maybe a total of 20 minutes.<//review><Gmap_id>0x808fa34f6d434021:0xc3b65be945a882bb<//Gmap_id><resp>{'time': 1564413957120, 'text': "Thank you so much for the positive feedback and for taking the time to post this review.

<Text>Please do yourself a favor and consult a real orthodontist!  I had a terrible experience and unless you have very minor corrections needed, would not recommend a mail-order service.  You will NEVER get a chance to speak to the actual dentist/orthadontist working on your case. So all questions go through a 3rd party support that is outsourced outside the country. I had problems with bite after treatment and never received the aligners in an attempt to help.  Waited now 3 months and the outsourced customer support is very unhelpful with repeated mistakes. Also, despite what the website claims, no insurance accepts them, so if I would have gone to a "real" orthodontist it would have been the same cost.  Truly a huge disappointment on all aspects.<//Text>< pictures>

<Rate>4< /Rate><text>Very thorough explanation of the entire process and it felt better for me to go to the office rather than do it by mail.

I gave four stars because the technician brushed over two of my concerns 1 that I detected a change in her voice after she put her trays in (I use my voice for a living) and 2 I talked about my concern with what I’ve heard about not so great customer service and she brushed it aside. She seemed really nervous, I assume because she’s new or relatively new.

Other than those two things she did a great job!<//text>< Pics>

<Review>Pros
1) Very cordial, informative, helpful dental assistant who walked me through entire process.
2) Modern hi-tech 3D scanning done in minutes.
3) They accept HSA, FSA
4) Payment options available.
5) Nice, clean place
6) many before and after photographs available
7) I am going to get video of myself before and projected AFTER
8) 6-8 months treatment
9) Warranty on aligners
10) Licensed orthodontist inspect the progress every 90 days

Cons
1) I had to wait 20 minutes after my appointment time due to rush. May be because I did not confirm my appointment using link they sent me previous day.< /Review>< Pics>

<user_id>100346150338445228207</user_id><Review>#1,Manager now is "Jamie", not  "Janette" listed on emails. Tsk tsk, sloppy.

#2,Had to call twice(2 call centers, somewhere) to get address of free on Saturday for 90 min parking, public garage around corner. The address is "830 JEFFERSON" for your GoogleMap navigation.

#3,Had to call to see if AmEx cards accepted. Should list accepted forms of payment.

#4, Was told I would receive side by side pictures of old crooked teeth and new graphic design in "72 hours"/3 days. Did not happen.

#5, lots of emails before visit, but not to local store and Manager, "Jamie", but to headquarters in Nashville. So way too many redundant emails and none to the local store and Manager I was to visit.

#6, tablet contract was hard to sign on the bottom edge without a desk and better e-pen.

#7, When I arrived, the office was empty. Understaffed?
I pushed a button on the counter to "check-in". Odd.
Sat and waited, early for appt. Am I expected??
Then manager Jamie(not a Dentist)showed up and had me fill out a too tiny tablet form and told me she got "none of my email replies." Odd.
The office is in a building of lots of barbers and other skin care tiny stalls, so you have to search once inside the main door, not the front to the side service entrance door.  Oops! It should be signed, "SERVICE ENTRANCE ONLY". I avoid RWC and the rude jury duty or greedy unjust traffic court so don't know it as well as other Peninsula cities.

#8, I was told my aligners may be for only "6-12 months" instead of "2 years" as my teeth aren't so bad. But my dentist says "Slower is always better than faster for aligning teeth with braces or clear plastic devices."

I'm 'a bite' worried, but paid with my AmEx card.</Review></record>

< Review>
Visited the SmileShop in Redwood City today.   What a great experience.  The team working there were very nice and welcoming.

After filling in some personal info on their iPad, it was off to another office for the 3D image of my teeth and smile.  Quisa, a dental assistant, was efficient, friendly and fast in doing the image.  She answered all my questions.  The technology is amazing.

Once the 3D image was complete, we talked about next steps and the payment plan ($1895 or $250 down and $85 month for 24 months).  This is about the third of the cost for regular braces.  And on average, takes about 6 months of wearing aligners all the time except when eating and drinking.

I am not yet sure that I will order the aligners but I highly recommend checking out the SmileShop in Redwood City.<//Review>

Have done my nails a couple of time and I honestly love them. sometimes not exactly how I want the shape but when the color is on I forget about the shape just because he has a lot of beautiful colors. My nails are nail form which I truly recommend if you are like me sensitive and the plastic nail hurts you plus the acrylic. Just do nail form yes a bit more expensive but you will be happy that your nails feel somewhat natural. Yes every one is different so give it a try so you can see for yourself. And Don is the person to go too make appointment in advance or try your luck like me sometimes I get lucky and sometimes I don't when I do just walk in. I< /Text>

<Review>Liked the work... I would come back for sure... the wait was long...very long tho it was my 1st time and I didn't know if you had appointment it would be better on the waiting... this was my 1st and last time I did my nails before quarantine...but I would definitely come here again.< /Review>< Pics>

Waited for about an hour and a half and didn’t even get my nails done, on a Wednesday night!! The owner didn’t have the decency or professionalism to let me know they weren’t going to be able to attend me and I was sitting in front of him the whole time. When I asked why didn’t they let me know earlier about the wait times he seemed unbothered about my complaint and totally unapologetic. They do an ok job but are pricey, I don’t think the lack of professionalism and customer service is worth the price.

We should boycott this establishment so that they can provide the Hispanic community (which is about 95% of their clientele) the dignity and respect we deserve.</Text>

No customer service at all!!! You make appointment and still wait for 2 hours and still nothing... They don't care if you wait because they feel they do great nails... They high as hell and will have you waiting like your time and money is not important... Bad business D & Trini...</review>

Nice little place. Don is the master of nail art; he is gentle and precise, but everyone wants him so an appointment is highly recommended. Sundays are walk in only. Yesterday (Sunday) the first person was in line at 10 and they open at 11 so go early if you don't want to wait. Trini also did a great set on my daughter 💅</Text><pics>None</pics>< Response>

If I could give 0 stars I would. EXTREMELY racist. Rude the two times I went. I will not go again seeing as I had to walk out the second time. First time I called to make an appt he said “no appt needed just walk in” I go in and he said “you should’ve made an appointment”. I had to wait 5 hours and he rushed. The second time I come right when they open they made me wait two hours and kept putting people before me after he told me only 1 hr. I then stepped in and asked why he said oh appointments come first. I asked well how much longer it’s been 3 hours he said “maybe 3-4 hours more” THIS PLACE IS RUDE. I sat there politely each time. But I have nothing but negative experiences< /text>

<Text>I don’t how to even start but all I got to say is that the main guy who did my nails was 👍🏽 nice and respectful!!!BUTTTTT!!!!!! He charges waaayyy too much!!! I wasn’t happy at all with the pricing!! Only because I was told after of other reasonable prices at other nails salons!! $150 for my ombré but nails with diamonds!! Honest to God every where I went I was complimented.. still doesn’t justify the over prices!! Yes I know why did get them done there all it was my birthday n it was 3 days b4 my actual event!! I know places like these need one week in advance appointments.. I so regret it<//Text><pics>None</pics><response>None</response><GmapID>0x80c2c94bb03ebdc5:0xfba158010a837010< /GmapID></record>

<Review>If you are in this area, you must come here for a breakfast or lunch.
I found the quality of the food is beyond your expectations of the busy city.
This family run business provides high quality food, drinks AND LOW PRICES at the same time.
Try their Hi-T smoothie for detox!
Hi-T cheese steak on a Dutch crunch bread for a great start of your day!<//Review><gmapID>0x808f7c237ada7fd3:0x3a88d87cf7210393<//gmapID>< Pictures>

< Review>
I came here not expecting the healthy drinks would be any different than other places, but I was impressed with the smoothie I had and the price.  Inexpensive and high quality ingredients go into all the drinks and it comes in a larger size!  There is food as well.  I shared a sandwich that was big so i split it with my gf.  Great service. I highly recommend people to go visit and try something on the menu.< /Review>

<user>103344216469680915451</user><text>This place is great.  We came here on the way one time to the beach and liked them so much, we came back again the next time we went to the beach.  They go above and beyond in service.  They had extra smoothie leftover, so the nice lady poured the rest in a little cup for us to enjoy!  It's the little details.  Sandwiches are fresh, green smoothies are healthy and delicious, prices are reasonable for the quality.  Also love that we are supporting small businesses.< /text><GmapID>0x808f7c237ada7fd3:0x3a88d87cf7210393< /GmapID>< resp>

<Review>So tasty and very sweet service. The owner is the counter lady and she makes a different herbal and caffeine tea each day. They also have your basic and fancy coffee if that's your style too. I will be a regular here for sure. Love it!</Review>< Pictures>

<Review>Finally, a new place in SF that is family run, super clean, has high quality ingredients including filtered water and ice, super warm and friendly AND the prices are affordable.

I paid $4.50 for a 20 oz. green smoothie and I got to substitute apple juice for almond milk with no added cost.

Thank you for caring about your products and your customers. That's the San Francisco I was raised in.</Review></record></dataset><record>

From the beginning I was greeted with such a warm smile. I loved that it was all organic and affordable. They even brought my partner and I some cantaloupe to our table. So grateful for such friendly and amazing service!<//Text>

Food always good and reasonably priced. Everyone is friendly. They have a "Buy 5 and get one free" plan for their sandwiches. My only problem is which sandwich to choose.< /Text>

It is a small little place that is comfortable to dine in. Everyone is nice here as I come here on a daly basis. Everything they make is healthy, even the smoothies doesnt have sugar. Their tea is very nice and their sandwiches are good. If you are looking for a healthy place to eat this is where you want to go.<//review>

He was $27 lower than the business I last used for Smogging. No wait. Smooth transaction. A little hard to find as not visible from the street. It is tucked behind a building on Fair Oaks Blvd. Worth looking for. He gave a coupon for next time. No air conditioned waiting area but he took less than 15 minutes.</text>

I've been going there since the 90's and take all my cars to him. He doesn't charge ridiculous prices like all these other smog places around town and it's in and out quick. Usually within 10-15 min. I always recommend Carmichael Smog!<//review>

<Review>Friendly enough and answered all my questions about smog. Older vehicles can only go certain places and they offer this. They were busy but he was working as fast as he could. It was nice to be able to see the test firsthand. I would recommend them!< /Review>< Pics>

It was great. I didn't have an appointment but only had to wait maybe 8 minutes for the car in front of me to get finished. Really nice guy, I come back every time for smog. And it was fast, maybe 15 min for my car test, I was in and out in about 25, and that's with someone in front of me 😁<//review>

<Text>Found this place through my mechanic and gave them a shot. Supper polite and easy going experience. I was in and out in 15 minutes at most with my certificate. They offer free retesting.

It's tucked away and not easy to spot from the Boulevard but it's worth the service.</Text><Resp>None</Resp><pics>None<//pics>< user_name>

We moved to Carmichael in 2004 and have been using Carmichael Smog since. He has always been fair and honest on any car that we've brought to him. In fact, I'm about to bring him another. 😁< /Text>

Everything passed except Visual inspection of catalytic converter. They could not find the number underneath my car and they failed the test. The guy asked me to get a new catalytic converter. How easy for him huh ! My catalytic converter is working fine and now he s asking me to spend another $500 so that he could easily see the numbers. Stupid Idiot.

Edit:
My car had a catalytic converter replaced in 2010 because it was stolen. It had been welded instead of using bolts and nuts so that the thieves could not steal it again. Is there was way to pass the test without replacing my catalytic converter ?< /text>

Old guy trying to take advantage of people that don't follow through with their work. Tried this guy for the first time than my normal guy since I moved he said won't pass but I know it does yelled at me like I'm his kid held my keys ransom until I paid than lied to to me said I would get my money back if I got second opinion and I did and my truck passed no problem and guess what he didn't want to give my money back with proof. Taking it up with better business and my bank money not the issue it's all about respect< /Review>

what is bad
-----------------
ran smog first but failed with communication error with car OBD/computer and smog machine  ($40)

i went to a auto repair, he ran tests and found OBD with no problem  (paid 30 min charge of $55)

went next day to do  smog re-test, communication problem again but this time, he replaced the connecting cable with another and pressed ends, it worked !!

I lost my $55 for no use.

the owner/manager kept blaming the car
he has no manners and short tempered

whats good
----------------
quick service, in 30 min , you are out  but better know some facts other wise you will be wasting
your time and money going to repair shops</text>

Prompt and courteous service.
Warning - the advertising is slightly deceptive. ¨10$ off so only $40.00¨ is not including the certificate, which costs an additional $8.75 (at least for a civic coupe).<//Text>

He would do the test but if your car uses K&N filter and it doesn't have the original sticker that has the E.O. he wouldn't pass it, but he would not tell you that before hand. He would tell you after he does the test and takes your money. I had the E.O. Number but like he said no sticker no retest.< /review>

I had a pedicure,  the technician did a wonderful job of cleaning up my cuticles and giving my feet a good scrub to remove all the dead skin. The shop is beautiful and clean,  wonderful staff and great environment.  I will definitely be back for regular pedicures! Thank you Novique!</review>

< Review>
I’ve gone to Aaron at a previous nail salon, I’ve gone to Jennie at a previous nail salon. Now I have them both in ONE place and I’m so happy! They both have done my acrylic and gel mani’s and I’ve never been disappointed. My daughters nails are the long ones (forest green) from Jennie and mines are the purple gel mani from Aaron. We love Jennie and Aaron!! Thanks guys!< /Review>

Kim did my most recent pedicure. She was friendly and did a great job. Everyone there is very welcoming every time I go in. They also have an amazing selection of colors. Everything is clean, everyone wears their masks and there is a temperature check and COVID screening questions before your service, so it feels as safe as possible. They even have touchless payment options. Will definitely be going back and recommending to all of my friends and family.<//Text>

Jennie is the greatest nail technician I have ever had. She is always accommodating whenever I need an appointment. Service is excellent and she is so artistic and great with nails. She can do some incredible nail design. The salon is super clean and fresh. I highly recommend this place, you won’t be disappointed.</text>

< Review>
I came to nail salon on a whim, I always go to the Tops yogurt next door and I thought I’d give it a try. Hellen did my toes and they look great but she didn’t keep the square shape that I asked for which is fine. I couldn’t relax though because Every nail Hellen filed she’d angle underneath the nail to my skin and got raw. Burned when alcohol was sprayed but atleast it was cleaned. The hot stones and massage with oil was amazing though!! Just recommend to be more cautious of the placement of the file because some people’s skin is very sensitive especially with my eczema!! I then got my nails done by Jennie I believe and they are amazing but the crystals are starting to pop off 2 days later. Got them done April 29th and it’s now May 1st and I luckily have nail glue to put the crystals back on. Satisfied with the 120$ spent but definitely needs some improvement!<//Review>

Decided to treat myself for a pedicure and came across Novique through Yelp. Their services and prices are all listed on their website which is a plus! I made an appt through Yelp and they were super fast to reply. I easily got an appt and they were able to answer questions I had. They have other payment options such as Venmo, zelle, and cash app. It was my first time here and they are strictly following health and safety measures during this pandemic. I was open for any technician and Kim was able to help me. Kim did a great job and took her time. She always made sure to ask if any of the treatments weren't too hot. I noticed she made improvements as time went on and made sure no callus was left which is great! I got the Ultimate Charcoal Detox Pedicure and it's worth it! Glad I chose this place. I truly recommend Nouvique to anyone and will for sure come back!</text>

<text>I’ve been going to Jennie for over 10 years and have followed her throughout Sacramento. I have never had someone take such care of me and my nails. I have never had my nails lift and she always makes time to fit me in her schedule. She is always professional and her prices have always been reasonable.< /text><response>{'time': 1609995739751, 'text': 'Thank you so much 😘❤️'}< /response><Date>1608400372132<//Date><Pics>None<//Pics>< username>

Jennie and her staff are absolutely phenomenal. They always listen to what you want and they never disappoint. The salon is always clean, peaceful, and relaxing. I have been going to Jennie for over a year now, and I couldn’t imagine going anywhere else.</review>

Can't wait to see you again for your next appointment."}< /Response><Text>They just had a grand opening a couple of months ago. The new owners renovated the whole place and installed brand new equipments/chairs/tables/everything. The decor is nice and simple; it has a rustic theme, which I really like. They also put on spa music so it's super relaxing and easy to doze off to 😌

I followed Aaron to this new place and I have been going to him for over 3 years now. I always get gels mani and pedi done and after 3 weeks they are still in good conditions (no chipping). I could go longer than 3 weeks but my nails grow fast. I sometimes get powder if I want my nails a little longer. I have a particularly smaller hands/nails so mine aren't the easiest to work on. However, Aaron is always patient and careful. He always make sure my nails come out perfectly. The pricing is also super reasonable. I would recommend this place to everyone!< /Text><gmap_id>0x809ac7a76c64987d:0xd3e21241f8e8a012</gmap_id><UserId.>109749246749840694071<//UserId.><Pictures>None<//Pictures></record>

After looking at trucks online for several months, I decided to make the hour drive to Hoblit Ram. Upon arrival, I was greeted by an older gentleman. When asked what I was looking for, two of the three trucks he knew to be sold. Went inside with him to look up the third. He told me it was available in the computer but went no further with me. However, I did ask if I may walk the lot and look for it myself. He replied, knock yourself out. While walking the lot and not locating the truck, same said gentleman walked by me never saying a word to me about my quest. Continued walk and passed another salesman which bypassed me and went to another couple.

My conclusion to the events that took place.

I am younger and covered in tattoos.

What they don’t realize.

They will now receive bad publicity. I will not buy a truck from them. I have $20k to put down, make $6-7k a week (Probably much more than any one of the salesman there) and have an almost 800 credit score.

Could have been an easy transaction.

After reading other reviews, it doesn’t appear they care about customer service.</text>

<text>Best experience I have had with purchasing a vehicle. Found the SUV we wanted online. George answered my call and was very courteous and informative of my questions. I live in Las Vegas and advised George I would fly in the next morning for purchase. Jumped on a plane the next morning and was even picked up from the airport by George to get to the dealer. Finance guy Alex was very friendly and had us laughing. Drove it back to Vegas with no issues, wife is happy. Thank you guys for the awesome customer service. I’d fly out there again for my next purchase for sure!</text></record></dataset><record>

I have been researching for a jeep wrangler  for about 6 month.  I after trying two other dealerships I found Hoblit online and gave them a call. Spoke with Danny about test driving the jeep, he invited me to the dealership and found my first choice of color that I wanted. He did a fantastic job and I was very happy with the price as well. But most of all I like that Danny made me feel comfortable and he genuinely was very helpful.<//Review>

<review>Had an amazing experience with Andrew and Alexander last night. We drove an hr to come here because they had the type of car we wanted. Not only did they work with us but in the end we got the monthly payment for less with bonuses added. Our 3 littles were being crazy and bored and they were great with them. I couldn't recommend them more. Best buying experience I have ever had.< /review><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None< /Resp><GmapID>0x8084d0e3fa092563:0x2b1aacef5548b40< /GmapID></record>

<rate>5<//rate><text>This was hands down the best car experience I have had working with a dealer. After 4 long and frustrating days of dealing with other car dealers, I gave it one last shot and reached out to Hoblit. Iran Acosta was my sales associate and he actually made the car buying experience enjoyable! I was looking to lease a 2021 Dodge Ram 1500. I gave him the specs I was looking for and he found the vehicle for me. He worked with me completely over text message (my preference) and gave me the cost of the lease upfront before I made the 2 hour trip. Hoblit even offered to match the quote that CarMax gave me for my trade in, which saved me the extra step of having to go to CarMax first and then Uber to the dealer. If I could give Hoblit 10 stars I would!< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

< Review>
Initial experience with dealership was online, their automated system scheduled me for an appointment later the same day to test drive a new powerwagon.  Arrived at the dealership to find out the truck was still in transit.  One of the salespeople had sent me a text 17min prior to my scheduled appointment trying to inform me of the truck still being in transit, unfortunately I didn't see this text until I had driven all the way to Woodland.  The sales rep I met told me their automated system should not be scheduling appointments.  After my experience I agree...
Be sure to speak to a live person before showing up at this dealership.  Nice and apologetic staff that I met gets them the two stars, otherwise my experience would have netted zero stars for this encounter.</Review>

<text>I bought my truck in 2017 at Hoblit and the purchase process went okay. However getting my vehicle serviced there has been a nightmare. I've had many vehicles serviced at many different places through the years, but Hoblit takes the cake as the worst service, least organized, SLOWEST service center I have ever been to. I am only mad at myself for going back to them for service for 3 years! You would be better off driving to Sacramento!<//text>< pictures>

<Text>It was a miserable dealer experience for me.

I was excited, when I went to the Hoblit Dodge web site, and saw they are "The No Hassle, No Pressure...Ever Dealership" and the business philosophy is and always has been providing "Honesty and Integrity in the Car Business." Unfortunately, I didn't experience any of that.

If they would have had ANY product knowledge about the vehicle they were selling me, and would have done what they said they would do, and did a proper pre-delivery checklist, and cleaned the vehicle this would have been an OK experience. My expectations were not unrealistic. It was my experience, once I signed the papers, they didn't do anything but push me out the door and off the lot. I purchased a $50,000+ vehicle and they didn't even properly clean the vehicle for me and I would have been happy with a typical car wash cleaning.

I will never deal with this dealership again.<//Text></record>

<Text>Straightforward with no games. Unfortunately that is rare in buying a car but it's what you get with Hoblit. My guy TJ took great care of me. Worked with me to get the truck I wanted at a price nowhere else could beat. Not only that but he made the process easy.

My wife and I had to wait behind one couple to get into financing and we were starving so we ordered some food from a pub down the street. As our food was ready for pickup we got called into financing. I told TJ and the financing guy (Alex) that I had to go pick up our food. TJ offered to run down grab it AND pay for it. I obviously couldn't let him do that but the extra above and beyond customer service experience is what you get with TJ and the crew at Hoblit. They also had 10 times the inventory of Rams than any other Dodge dealer in the area!</Text><pics>None</pics><Resp>None<//Resp><gmap_id>0x8084d0e3fa092563:0x2b1aacef5548b40</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

First of all, if you are going to purchase ANY truck or vehicle through this business,  get every detail in writing.
They are more interested in getting you to buy than they are in taking care of you after the purchase.
Also they don't clean,  fuel , or help with understanding the vehicles functions
When you ask them to correct things about your purchase,  they are more interested in defending their reputation rather than acknowledging the customers concerns.
I would not buy their again...unsatisfied< /Review>

My son bought his first vehicle here today! The entire process was direct and straightforward - pricing, financing, etc. Everyone was extremely professional and courteous.  I highly recommend buying from Douglas Heinrich. He'll take great care of you!</Text>

I Was thinking of going to see a truck today.  After reading reviews OMG, thanks for the heads up! I will pass. I have had some experience similar to some reviews here.
At other dealer and when you get persons like this I DONT take my business there. Hope mananagement can improve this recent complaint.  2 starts due to the fact im a potential  customer and evaluating reviews I won't consider this place any more.<//text>

<Text>I bought a used Tacoma from Hoblit last week. Great experience, fair priced, wonderful staff. Naveed was the sales person who helped us. He wasn't pushy and even put gas in it while I was doing paperwork! The staff was awesome and made it a great experience! Cannot give a high enough recommendation!!<//Text>< Date>

Bought a little older used Ram 2500 Diesel from their used Truck lot. Got it home and drove it for a week. Had the Death Wobble, rear axle leak and some other issues and they said it was not under warranty and I could bring it in for them to fix it. Once you drive it off the lot, you are basically screwed.< /Review>

Great experience! You guys have to be one of the best (if not THE BEST) dealer in the nation. Honest, straight forward, no gimmicks, great prices, and easy to deal with. What more could anyone ask for? You guys truly live up to your advertising. Frank in sales was great to deal with, plus very courteous and knowledgeable, and I liked the no pressure atmosphere. Having purchased 20+ new and used vehicles in my life, you guys have been the best purchase experience ever. My only regret is not doing business with you sooner. I'll be back!< /text>

<Text>Hobbit Chrysler Dodge, well everything went okay at the dealership except for they didn't have a rental car for us we had to wait two hours for our vehicle. Other than that everything was alright. well I didn't mean to get anybody in trouble. It had nothing to do with the oil change on Wednesday. It had to do with the lady up front saying that we had a rental car or a loaner and then when we got there they did not have one for us. The guy at the oil change station called us and said he might have lost some pay I hope not. Because he had nothing to do with it thank you very much Mr Livengood< /Text><Time>1596048389184<//Time><user_id>102178468131855351007</user_id></record></dataset><record>

Nice car but unable to make a fair deal. Went to look at a used 2019 vehicle with 50k miles on it and they tried to charge me 23k out the door when I can get the same model NEW 2020 with 0 miles for 25k. LOL! A very UN-American way to deal business. I'll be taking my cash somewhere else =)< /Review>

Recently Bought a 2020 Charger from this dealer and both times ive driven up, it was always a good experience, I recommend working with either Frank Roman or Dean Burkett, were both very nice and completely honest with any questions I had, none were pushy as you can find at other dealers, honored a trade in offer from 10,000 miles/ 7 months ago, so making the drive from the east bay was worth it, didnt pull any crazy fees or switch out numbers when the contract signing time came around, didnt waste my time at all, and a deal was made. 10/10</Text>

<rating>3<//rating><Review>Two different experiences, hence the mixed rating. Buying a car here was a very pleasant experience. Staff was very friendly, process very efficient. Didn’t feel pushed to buy like other Jeep dealerships in the area. Really was happy with how my purchase went.

Service experience, on the other hand, was a major disappointment. Came in for the express oil change, was told wait was an hour to an hour and a half. Three hours later, still waiting. Had I known it would have taken that long I could have caught a movie. At least there’s a movie theater across the street, so if you want to plan your day around the “express” oil change I guess that’s a thing. But it shouldn’t be that hard to communicate a realistic time. While I think it’s a great establishment in general, hard to recommend getting service done here.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics><response>None<//response>< gmap_id>

<review>After emailing back and forth for a month with..."
After emailing back and forth for a month with salesperson Alexis Contreras, and being told they would not go lower than the posted price of 49,985 for a Ram 2500, I agreed to the price.  I confirmed by email that there were no hidden fees or any tricks to the 49,985 price and I was assured that they were straight up, no hassle, no hidden fees.  I took time off of work, had a friend pick me up and drive me 2.5 hours to the dealership only to be told that they wouldn’t honor that price!  It 50,985 and too bad for you, it doesn’t matter what you were told.  I’ve bought one other truck there several years ago and had a great expo.  Apparently those days are long gone.  I’ll take my hard earned money elsewhere.

This place was a joke I have fair credit and was approved for a truck and didn't like the terms so I went to Hoblit. Worst decision ever. I have never been late on one car payment and this was my third vehicle purchase. They told me I had to put half down on ANY of the vehicles I was interested in after running my credit and putting 4 hard inquiries on my credit. Ill never go there again. Now I'm in a new truck on the terms I wanted.</text>

Amazing!! The vehicles here go very fast so contact them as soon as possible if you see something you like. I just bought a truck from them 3 days ago, it was a trade in and had just arrived when I called about it. Started the process of running the numbers, everything when through and 2-3 days later I came down and bought the truck at an even better price, monthly payment, and apr for a first time buyer. Very friendly and helpful staff. Thank you Naveed!</review>

Bought a Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid from the internet car salesman, Daniel (Danny) Gigena, who made the experience the best I’ve ever had.  I’ve purchased new cars from BMW, Toyota, Honda, and Chevy dealerships before, but this was a far superior experience.  We talked about the price online then arranged a time to come in, over the phone, Danny was incredibly responsive the whole way through.  This guy works hard all day long, for you.  We were in and out in just about an hour, just like he said.

I would recommend this dealership, the honest people there, and above all Danny (5/5 stars to him).  He went above and beyond every time to get things done, no bs.  Even when we didn’t show up on time, he was flexible.  I wouldn’t recommend any other dealership in NorCal, just this one.  It may not look much on the outside, but the people inside is what matters.  They are the BEST!  Staff is friendly, atmosphere is laid back, and the prices are great.  I emailed nearly every single dealership in the bay area and noticed that this dealership doesn’t BS you.  Buy from them is my only recommendation.<//review>

Well here we are over a month later. I still haven't received my vehicle part that I gave to this service company to put on. They just kept it. I came down once already and received all kinds of excuses. Apparently the auto techs like to B.S. and feed lies to Mario who relays what hes being told to his costumers. I thought it was Mario who was lying to me, only to find out his tech has all the good lies. Where is my parts I paid for that you guys stole???  Your tech tried lying to me, saying there was no bolts missing, (tried to make me look bad) until I showed him where the missing bolts are. Then I get the lame excuse of "Oh it was the New tech who's not here right now to defend himself, that was responsible for the error".  These techs are no good, and to date,  this is the only place I've gone to just one day after getting my oil changed, and these techs say that my oils dirty and they recommend a change. I dont know of any car that requires an oil change everyday. What a scam!  And if you guys want to disagree online with my comment,  I have no problem coming right back down there AGAIN,  and pulling your covers to your face.<//review>

The no hassle, low key sales staff were great to work with! Our sales guy, Danny was very knowledgeable, easy to work with, and had a good sense of humor, which made the truck buying experience relatively painless. He did a good job explaining the process and paperwork, as did Ken in Finance. It was actually kind of fun!< /text>

Look for Frank Roman when you're ready to buy. He is the most straight forward legit sales guy I've ever met. He's not there to bleed you dry and con you into a bad deal, he honestly wants you to be happy in the whole buying process. He's a no pressure cool guy and didn't feel like I was dealing with a salesman.  Lots of selection of trucks. Great prices with no hidden costs.</text>

<review>Exceptional dealership. Staff (Frank and Josh) were very helpful. Recent purchase or a business cargo van. Dealership held the vehicle nearly three weeks without a deposit until our accounting could arrange payment. Would highly recommend and will definitely use again.<//review></record>

Over the moon with my experience with this dealership, especially Dean as he was genuine in every aspect of the purchase. Even Sandy picked up an over charge with my DMV paperwork and I'll get a bit of a refund. So glad you guys cross yours T's and dot your I's. Oh I even got a Thank You card from them, I'll definitely recommend them even from afar!</Text>

<Rate>5</Rate><Text>I purchased a used 2018 Porsche Macan at this dealership in Woodland. I had a very great overall experience. Very pleasant and friendly people. They have a policy of no hassle, no pressure sales, which they truly standby. Their prices are very reasonable and from their straightforward service you can see that they work something out such that you and the dealer are happy at the end of the day.

My sales person (I think Kevin) was very patient when we wanted to test drive once more to confirm a particular feature in the car. And he stayed back late at work (though we were done with the sale) to send us off after done with finance. Their finance guy Alex is very friendly, energetic and you do get the feeling that he works for your best interest!< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

<text>The best car buying experience. Unlike all the past purchases of hours of negotiating.  Internet Sales Manager Frank Roman was professional, friendly and fast.   We were out of the dealer ship within 90 minutes.

Visit Frank Roman and definitely see Alex Pagan in finance.

Fair price for a great truck. Joe at the truck center was upfront, honest and very helpful. Did some research first and found that I couldn't beat the price In Sacramento or Roseville, so I bought locally.< /Review>

Got a 2003 Mustang GT about a year ago(sight unseen, I live 3 states away).
It was as promised as has been trouble free. Even through a slight communication error, the dealer stepped up and made it better than right. I would trust and recommend these guys whether you are local or not.< /text>

I went in expecting to not be approved for a vehicle. But the salesmen made the process enjoyable and very easy. Surprisingly, they approved us for a vehicle and the guys made me feel confident in my decision. Now here I am, happy as can be, with a brand new Jeep Cherokee. I am thankful for the guys over at Hoblit for making my first buying experience a great one!</text>

< Review>
Our salesman, Dean, was great. Easy to get along with, not pushy, not overbearing. He was extremely helpful in making sure we got exactly what we wanted at the price we wanted and that we had all of our questions answered regarding our new truck.
Alexander in Finance was also great. He made sure the finances worked out the way we needed them to.
We live about 1.5 hours away from this dealership but made a point to come all the way out here, despite being in the Bay Area and having plenty to choose from. We ended up with a badass Power Wagon, which you don't find at many dealerships, and we got it for a screaming deal. Their Ram selection is unparalleled. We would drive 1.5 hours again for this big decision.<//Review>

All their Internet prices are fake. They will tell you the rebates don’t exist anymore once you show up. Or that so you don’t qualify for the rebates. Just go to a dealership close to you that advertises the real price and give them the business.these guys are all about the bait and switch</Review>

I made the trek up there and was greeted immediately by a friendly gentleman named "Kush" Singh.

He acknowledged my presence right away even though he was with someone else and I could see the rest of the service team working away on cars. Good signs so far--- He got to me and I asked him if they could do an express oil change and he said of course! He took my information, talked to me about what they would be doing and directed me to the waiting area.

In under an hour he came back out to find me and went over the multiple point inspection and told me they even tightened up some loose items on my suspension for me.

AMAZING service and attention to customer service was had by Kush and his team at Hoblit--- You have made a customer for life (As long as Kush is there) :)  Believe me guys-- its worth the drive up to Woodland And along the street nearby are some cool Coffee shops and Pubs to grab a bite to eat. I also noticed that all the sales folks were very friendly and I didnt see the normal upset expressions on the buyers faces as they worked with them.. thats got to be a good sign.<//text><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None< /Resp><gmapID>0x8084d0e3fa092563:0x2b1aacef5548b40<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Excellent customer service.  Great guys in the Main Street Service Department.  Blaz and Lewis (Louis?) are top-notch people who will take good care of you and your vehicle.
Nobody likes getting a Recall Notice on their car. In our case, the recall was a part on our Jeep Wrangler. We are in the Sacramento area, so researched the customer reviews on all nearby Jeep Dealers. Our Jeep is our primary vehicle and we are very picky about who works on it.
Even though Hoblit Jeep was the furthest in miles away from us, they had the best reviews by far. We opted to make the drive and use them for the work needed.
From the moment we arrived, we were treated with the best customer service. They were right on schedule, no waiting to get started, and even took the time to talk with us about a couple other concerns we had that were unrelated to the recall.
The estimated time to complete the replacement part was accurate. The work done was perfect and we couldn’t even tell a technician had been working inside our vehicle, it was so clean.  The staff there took good care of our Jeep and were courteous and warm the entire time we were there waiting.
After our experience with the staff at Hoblit, we made up our minds that when we are ready to purchase a new Jeep, this is the dealership that will get our business. They have definitely won our loyalty and trust. How many dealerships are able to do that in this day and age? Good job, Hoblit!< /Text>

Painless, Josh pulled out several options for us.  Looked through each one and then picked one, took it for a drive, got educated on the systems of the truck and purchased it. The trade-in process was easy and fair.  We got the truck we wanted with all the accessories we wanted for a price we wanted to pay.< /Review>

Was shopping for a new truck for almost 2 years. Kept going back to Rams, and almost pulled the trigger at another dealer closer to home, but the salesman seemed "so used car salesman", and just knew I was going to get screwed by the "man behind the curtain." After searching online, found that Hoblit seemed to have the best selection of Ram Trucks. Drove out to Woodland, was disappointed at first at their Main office, till the Salesman brought me to the truck center.
Not only did the salesman seem genuine, how could you fail be named "Dart", working at a dodge dealer! But he showed me the exact truck I was looking for, even though it wasn't the "top of the line" model. Had to wheel and deal a bit, walk away once and sit and wait for "the man behind the curtain." But I got what I came for, for the price I wanted, and drove away with my Ram 1500 with 50 miles on it in less then 2 hours.
Thanks Hoblit for the continued good service, communication, price, and no haggle ( well not too much ) deal.
When the time comes I'll be back, and have recommended Hoblit to friends and colleagues.</text>

If you are in the market for a new Dodge/Ram truck you have to go see Jacob Sherwood at the Hoblit Truck Center in Woodland.  They have a huge inventor and they aren't afraid to list their prices online. This is not your typical old school car buying experience where you have to spend half a day negotiating and wondering what the fine print says.  This is a no pressure  atmosphere where they want to make sure your leave satisfied with your purchase.  I told Jacob what I was looking for and in less than an hour all the paperwork was done, including the time it took to pick out a custom lift kit with tires and wheels.  If you are looking to add aftermarket  items with your purchase, the sales team and the service team work together to make sure you get what you want.  They don't limit you to a few options they get dealer pricing on, its what you want and how you want it done.  Brian and Pavina in the service department were awesome to work with while the lift, tires and wheels were being installed.  They kept me informed of the progress and were super accommodating with what dates and times worked for me.  I drove an 45 minutes out of my way due to my local dealership not being able to compete with the inventory or pricing and it was well worth it.
Thanks to the entire Hoblit Team for all your help.</review>

So we looked elsewhere earlier this week and left the local dealership feeling uneasy and as if they were trying to hustle us. So instead of purchasing there we drove 30 miles out of town to go to Hoblit per the recommendation of a friend who previous sold cars at a different dealer. He told us that he knew Hoblit would give us a fair and honest price, of which they did. The price of our vehicle was what they advertised, our salesmen Frank explained everything clearly and made sure we were getting everything we needed and a whole lot of what we wanted in our New Ram Truck. We ended up leaving Hoblit with a payment we can afford without stretching our budget, within terms we wanted, with warranties that cover what could come up and at a fair interest rate thanks to their finance guy (Tim? Sorry, I forgot your name) . I would happily recommend and will recommend both Frank and Hoblit to our friends and family. It's worth the drive for the service and the atmosphere.<//Review>

But Kathleen made sure that I was taking care of and have my service done that day. Kathleen, I very appreciate your awesome customer services and your care for your customers. Fast Service! gave me a ride to a restaurant so I can have breakfast while they were working on my car, and call me when ready. Thank you!!!! I'm glad I'm your customer.</Text><user>108487864841381222514</user></record>

<time>1529795823670</time><rating>1<//rating><review>Our experience with this dealership was pathetic at best.  They had the truck in inventory that we wanted to buy, and we tried contacting them through multiple avenues, but they refused to even communicate with us after we asked if they could match or at least come close to matching the discounts of 3 other dealers, 1 in Reno and 2 in Idaho.  They advertise they have the best pricing anywhere, but they refused to even come close.    We would have been happy if they were within $500 as the other dealers were going to need to order our exact truck.....we never leave reviews, especially negative ones, but the least they could have done is return a phone call, text, or email to let us know what they were willing, or were not willing to do....no correspondence of any kind is unacceptable.......Do your homework when they tell you they have the best price.....likely they do not!<//review><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>{'time': 1529972566903, 'text': "Hello Mr. Solomon.  We are sorry to hear that you did not get the attention you deserved and the price quote you wanted.  Our claim to have the best prices anywhere is confined to our local market and not to dealers of other states.  There are times when dealers out of state do have better prices than us but they have different incentives and rebates from the factory that are not available to us.  We realize being in Oregon can limit your choices in finding the right Ram truck for your needs so therefore you looked out-of-state.  We have spoken to your Sales Rep and he did show us that he had communication with your wife via text.  Once again, we are sorry the we couldn't get you the deal you wanted."}< /Resp><gmapID>0x8084d0e3fa092563:0x2b1aacef5548b40</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<text>This dealership has the best selection and biggest inventory of trucks in Northern California! After an initial hiccup with the negotiations, which I attribute to their huge inventory, they did right by me and I drove away with an awesome truck. Mistakes happen; it's really good to see a dealership be accountable and make things right.

Arrived 20 minutes before they opened, hoping to get  good place in line for a simple oil change and tire rotation (that I have already paid for in my service contract). The shop has a few trucks already on the lift and there is only 1 truck in front of me in line. The service manager sets me up for service and then tells me my truck will be ready in 3 hours. Really? 3 hours for a simple oil change and tire rotation when I showed up early to get in line? Crazy. I got back in my truck and came home. I don't have 3 hours to wait for an oil change, when other service centers can have me in and out in less than 45 minutes. Who has 3 hours to waist on a simple service? If I hadn't been conned into a service contract, I'd probably never go back but now that I'm stuck in this, I'll have to deal with it I guess.  On a positive note, the tech that has serviced my truck the last 2 times is very personable and tries his best to make the best of a bad situation<//review>

Great experience, bottom line pricing, easy in and out. The staff was more then welcoming and helpful. They didnt use weird terms that seem popular to the industry to try and make you feel like your "special" with them or that your the only one getting a "deal". The price of our new jeep was alot lower then anywhere else in California, and we didnt even need to haggle the price down.<//Review>

<Review>Horrible experience and expectations. I bought a used vehicle with high mileage however I wasn't expecting it for so much to go wrong in such a short amount of time. The catalytic converter and transmission all went out with in 2 months of purchase. I definitely would not recommend their business.< /Review><response>None< /response>< username>

After 14 years of driving our old vehicle, we finally decided to purchase a new vehicle, Jeep Grand Cherokee. Thank you Curt Lopez and Alex Pagan at Hoblit Dodge Chrysler Jeep Ram. They made our car buying experience a pleasant one. Definitely not your "stereotypical" car salesmen. Very friendly staff, No pressure sales.  Thank you #Hoblitdodge</review>

Great Dealership!!! Thank you Dean and Alex- Awesome Team....
If you are looking for a new car head to Woodland, Excellent Service.
You have to see "Dean" in Sales and 'Alex' in Finance.
10 stars for you both **********
By far the easiest deal I have ever had- in 20+ years of purchasing cars...
Hoblit is lucky to have you on their Team!!<//Review>

I started the communication on a desire on-line. Then follow up phone calls from dealer. Before I go to the place they have the car ready, application ready, and great service. Love this place after trying 5 different dealer. Explanation and the offers were clear. No hidden surprise or shocking number. Try them first, you will be surprise of the friendly staff.<//text>

When I got there I had to actually find a salesman. I was out there for like 15 min. No one came out.

The worst part was the finance guy. He was way to aggressive. Trying to sell me gap insurance.  I told him several times no. And you can tell he was frustrated with me.
Than he played the game there might be something wrong with my loan. But said it in a low tone. Than he left the room pretending to talk to his manager.
In hind sight I should of left.

They got me on a key fob fee which was bs. I should of stranded my ground but I didnt.
The other game was, he when he was trying to sell me gap insurance, it was 1600dollars. But the trick is, when you cant say you can afford it or it's too expensive they will extend the loan and pretend to bring the price down. But also he took off almost half the price of the gap insurance.
Meaning they were going to try to over sell you on gap insurance but really they can sell it for about 895.
But you can cancel the gap insurance within thirtys days which they don't tell you. And I'm going to do it.
The car salesman was cool. Your typical saleman. But he wasn't a jerk.
I should of done a better job and being more prepared.  Meaning I should of been pre approved before going there.
Lesson learned. I'll definitely be better prepared and be ready to walk away and go some where else.

I hope this will help others. If your a type of person that is kind of timid better bring someone who wont be pushed over.</Review>

<review>Definitely the best and most reliable service. Had a bad blow out and was stranded with no spare. Had my sister and her baby with me. Just took a quick phone call to Mr. Blaz and he sent a tow truck immediately. The tow truck driver Jim was awesome and waited with us until the service vehicle came to pick us up. He even offered his help to another person that had a blow out in the same spot shortly after me! Awesome service you can count on!!< /review><gmap_id>0x8084d0e3fa092563:0x2b1aacef5548b40</gmap_id><date>1510672060429<//date>< Pictures>

My husband and I went to Hoblit Chrysler to purchase a car thanks to Josh the salesman he made it all possible. He was truly amazing he made the transition as smooth as possible. He had great customer service and what we loved the most about him was that he was very honest and experienced. I highly recommend him if you are looking for a car go see him he will make it happen and save you alot of money. Thank you, Josh you are an asset to the company.<//review>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Review>My experience with the staff at Hoblit Dodge was nothing short of extraordinary. They have  a no-pressure,  family-like atmosphere and I felt very at home and welcomed soon as I set foot inside!! Danny Gigena is by far the best sales representative I've ever encountered in buying a car. He was very attentive and helpful and made my experience very pleasant. My mother who absolutely hates the car buying process was very very pleased with Danny's disposition and thoroughness. I would recommend Hoblit Dodge to any one of my friends and/or family members for their new or used car buying needs. Great job to Danny and everyone who helped make this experience seemless!! Thank you so much for welcoming me to the Hoblit family!!< /Review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

This dealership will start out with a professional demeanor and then when you start question things, they become defensive as if you are attacking them individually. They will give you a great price for the vehicle and then once you get to finance, they pull fast ones. I needed a co-signer on my tuck since my "credit history wasn't long enough". We worked out that I would sign that evening and the next day they would drive the papers to my co-signer. This was fine until the point we came to the location of the loan. We talked about only two places and I signed for only one of them. The next morning when they finally decided to run the loan it didn't go through with that credit union. When they took the papers to my co-signer they had papers for some random credit union they chose and didn't even explain. The only way we realized what they had done is when we received papers from the original credit union saying we weren't approved and that we were approved at the random one.

The finance guy also never explained anything that I was signing. The first thing he said when I walked in to the room was "I need to hurry this up, I have an appointment". Last I checked, me being there in the finance office is what keeps him there.

When we called to question it, they stated "they have no reason to tell us and that they can apply us for any company that they wish without notification". We spoke to the finance manager Dave who was relatively helpful. We also spoke to Dave Mercer the location manager who lacked the professionalism to deal with the situation. He proceeded to talk over us and wouldn't allow us to fully ask a question before he would cut us off. At one point he told us that he was 10 seconds from hanging up the phone. He actually hung up on us later in the conversation!! We called back and asked to talk to the owner of the business. He stated he "didn't know when the owner would be in" and when we asked if he could leave a note for the owner to call us, he was highly evasive.

Frank Roman and Curt Lopez are the nicest guys at this dealership and definitely know how to get customers to buy vehicles. They did not pressure me once!<//review>< Pics>

I have never had such a wonderful experience at a dealership!! Every single person I dealt with in your service department was top notch, from their customer service skills, to their knowledge to their willingness to be so helpful.  I live in Vacaville and have gone to Vacaville Dodge/Jeep and the (now closed) dealership in Fairfield, many times and have had nothing but TERRIBLE experiences.  You guys really set the bar high and I won't go anywhere else for my Jeep service needs from this point forward! Thank you so, so much!</Review>

<review>Have had nothing but good experiences with this Dealer, i have bought 2 vehicles from them since 2015. They have given me the best trade in values and best prices on both purchases. I would also like to thank them for their attention to detail. I guess they sent me a check back in 2015 after i brought my truck, dont know what happened to the check, don't even remember getting one. But they reached out to me a month ago asking if i ever got it because the check had never been cashed and it flagged in their system. Today I recieved another check and I plan to deposit this one. Thank you.<//review>< pics>

Flew in from sandiego to purchase a new dodge ram. I was a little nervous buying a one way ticket.  I have to say the deal we negotiated on the phone was exactly what I received. No suprises at all. They did exactly what they said they would. Danny and stu pulled no suprises just great customer service.  Have no fear with this dealership.
Now go get your new truck, you cant beat their prices or service!!!

I was traveling from Santa Monica to Oregon with my son, when I heard an aweful noise going on in my car. I stopped at the closest dealership I could find. Blaz was and his team were so comforting and kind. I was extremely impressed. It was like family. Thank you for helping me, and getting me home safely.  I will never forget your kindness.< /Review>

CAUTION! If you find a vehicle that you just Must have on one of their lots....COME IN WITH YOUR OWN FINANCING!! DON'T AUTHORIZE A CREDIT CHECK, EVEN IF THEY INSIST!!! ....We bought a truck from this dealership,  on April 4, 2019, picked it up on the 6th. Today,  4/29/19, we received a denial of credit,  dated 4/23/19?!?....Crazy???? From the start of our visit we told our salesman, Frank Roman ( Who, by the way, is the man to see! He was a well informed, very competent sales person!),  that we intended to use our own credit union and that we had already spoken to them. He said he needed to run our credit, as a formality. On the 4th there were no problems and we were presented with a sales order and 2 days later, after the truck had been mechanically checked out and detailed,  we returned to pick up the truck.  On April 9, we visited our own credit union,  learned that the dealership had run our credit 4 times on the 4th(??), thus lowering my credit score by 15 points! Not only that, they were charging us 3X's the amt. for the GAP insurance! Then, when our credit union tried to work with them to cut a check for the truck, the Finance mgr. of Hoblit was very nasty and unprofessional, actually screaming so much that the credit union Finance Officer had to contact her Area Manager to deal with him. And, by the way, the dealership was cut a check on April 10th! The agenda of the dealership financial manager is crystal clear!! He is now intent on further damaging our credit!?!?! We never met, nor have we ever spoken this individual.</review>

Let me start by saying I am a difficult person to deal with when purchasing a car. I ask a lot of my sales person and am not afraid to walk from the deal at any given point. I worked with David Mercer the BDM of sails. I found him to be very professional and honest through the negotiating process of my Dodge Ram 3500. I found that every one on the sales team to be respectful as well as professional. my thanks to everyone for putting up with me. i recommend them if your in the market for a new or used car/truck.<//review>

The feeling I got was that they don't need your business unless you're paying cash. They supposedly sell 400 trucks a month. Essentially, they don't want your trade in because they discount their vehicles so low that your trade is useless to them. A new Dodge truck can be less than a used truck. Don't get me wrong, their prices are hard to beat most of the time, although Elk Grove Dodge can beat them as well as Sacramento Dodge depending on the time of month. They advise you to sell your car/truck at Car Max so they don't have to deal with it. They low balled my truck by about $2000.00 then basically told me to leave when I respectfully challenged their offer. It's an interesting way to do business. It reminded me of the soup Nazi from Seinfeld: "No Dodge for you."< /text>

<text>Absolutely do not purchase a vehicle from this place. We bought a 2016 Ford F450 from here in Nov of 2018 and it has been in the shop 7 times for a total of 4 weeks. We asked if the truck was ever in an accident they said no but the ford dealer in our town gave us the carfax and it has been and the shop that repaired it didnt do it right so its back in the shop and has been for the last 2 weeks and needs a new motor. Thankfully it is covered under warranty but it has been a hassle. The windshield leaked like crazy, the injectors needed to be reprogrammed, the exhaust system has malfunctioned, coolant is leaking into the motor so its overheating and thats just a few things the list goes on. We purchased the truck a little over 4 months ago for over $56,000 paid cash so we expected it to work longer then this and not in and out of the shop. Thank gosh we purchased the extended warranty. This dealership doesnt make deals at all since we were paying cash we tried to barter with them but no go they even charged $5000 for the warranty. We asked them to fill the tank for us and they said no we will put half a tank. I purchased a car that was only $21,000 and they filled my tank and gave a lifetime warranty on the powertrain this dealership is not customer friendly and does not have the customers best interest in mind. Avoid this dealership. If i could give a negative rating i would.< /text><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

Found Hoblit while looking at ads on the internet for a Jeep Renegade. Needed a new car since my car suffered engine failure. I noticed the sale prices here at Hoblit were the same or better than the auto malls. Decided to come here because they are in my county. One thing I will say is this is a small town dealership with the small town feeling. Not pushy and not trying to sell you more than you came to see. My salesperson was Dart (not joking ..his name is Dart). This guy was really easy going and a blast to talk with. I cut to the chase and told him I wanted a Renegade in black for the advertised price. He took me for a test drive and I was pretty sure I wanted this Renegade. After going through the numbers I decided I would take my time and check other dealerships to see if they had a better deal. After almost a week of getting the beatdown at auto malls, I ended up right back here buying the Renegade at the advertised price. It was the best deal. I will definitely return to Hoblit when it's time to buy again. I hope this place stays the same. It is so much easier to buy from the local guys. Thanks Hoblit. I will be back.</review>

Great experience right up until the point you need Anything from them. Typical dealer reactions, blowing smoke up your ass, tell you what you need to hear to hang up the phone & Never follow through with Anything. Cant wait until I get what I need from them so I can go elsewhere. I should have guessed they are no different even being a small town dealer</Text>

< Review>
My parents were affected by the camp fire in paradise I drove my 2017 ram 2500 across county to give it to my parents so they could buy a 5th wheel to live in. when we called to get a 5th wheel installed they told us it was going to take 3 weeks to get the part. After my dad explained our situation brandie from service made some calls and she was able to get us an appointment the next week. we took the truck in an got a full service and 5th wheel hitch installed. The manager jamie hall worked with us on the price to save us as much as they could. Kathleen still also helped my dad when he arrived from the moment he got there until he left she helped him through the whole process. The whole hoblit team was amazing i bought my truck from them and they continue to go above and beyond for their coustomers I highly recommend them for anyone who is buying a truck or just looking to get service done.<//Review>

Excellent Customer service!! Started before we even stepped foot on the lot with Danny. My family and I would like to thank the team @ Hoblit CDJR, especially Daniel Gigena for making the buying experience a memorable one! We love our Dodge and would definitely recommend to all our family and friends!  :)<//Review>

<Review>COME HERE AND FIND DANNY GIGENA!!! This is the best place to buy a truck. Their truck lot, which is located else where has a great staff. Their brand new trucks are priced so well that no other dealership can beat them. If you come here try to find Danny Gigena, he is an honest, patient, and thoughtful man that will take care of your needs. He is super helpful and patient. HE will get you the truck you want no matter what.<//Review>< Pictures>

What can I say....Josh at Woodland Hoblit Chrysler Jeep Dodge in woodland is da man....2 cars in 3 months and could not be happier with the service I received from him.   He is very patient, knowledgeable and works great under pressure.... Never been happier with a dealership before going to Hoblit.  Thank you again Josh and the whole crew at Hoblit.</Text>

<Text>I bought a 2015 Tacoma that was a trade in from this dealership about a month ago. The sales guy who sold me the car was named Jeff Ferraiuolo. As we all know, the people who seems to be the friendliest are usually the most crooked one. This was exactly that. I originally thought I got a good deal on my car but apparently I did not. As buying cars goes, Jeff and the finance guy tried to stick me with a higher apr from the start which I obviously did not agree too. After some back and forth Jeff came back and tried to use my age as a crutch to why I could not get the rate that I wanted and he went on saying due to me being a first time buyer it was not helping me. That was when I told him I was not a first time buyer and that the car parked outside was my first car purchased. He stuttered for a bit obviously due to being caught in his own lie and went back. After an hour or so we agreed on a rate. As I said before, I thought I had a good deal until I recieved a letter from Sacramento Credit Union stating that I was not approved through them during the finance process due to the amount request exceeding their policy and terms. The amount requested was over $4000 more than the price we agreed on. I called and asked Jeff why a larger amount was requested and the only answer he could give me was probrably because they thought I was going to buy a warranty with the car which I did not buy. I asked him why was I not asked first before that assumption was made and the only thing he could say after that was that this is something I need to talk to finance about and he knows nothing about it. I proceeded on and tried to contact the finance department on 2 occasions now and have yet to hear back from them.<//Text>< rating>

I purchase a used 2016 Charger mid September 2019 and the vehicle has been in the service department 3 times since getting it.  The car jumps/lunges into low gear when coming to a stop and there is a tapping noise coming from the engine.  The claim that the transmission issue is normal, also the lifters were supposedly replaced...but the same noise is continuous.  Dropping off again to have Hoblit.< /Text>

Never have fixed a problem with any of my Dodge or Chrysler vehicles. Get charged $500-$1000 and same problems exist, then charge more to experiment with another fix. Doesn't credit for repairs that don't work. Labor charges are outrageous for them to TRY and fix it. But...never fixed<//review>

Great sales person, horrible finance manager, misrepresenting additional products forced upon the buyer!

GM emailed for feedback but failed to acknowledge a response.

Buyer beware...make sure you understand the price isnt the price...count on extras when you don't have a choice not to purchase.<//review>

I had a great experience at Hoblit Dodge I got a brand new 2017 Dodge Ram 1500 no hassel or pressure what so ever thanks to Dean and his team for getting me into a new truck and it only took less then an hour to do the paperwork. I would recommend this dealership to anyone if your looking for a new car or truck I recommend going to Dean he did an awesom job thanks and keep up the good work guys.<//Review>

<Review>Service dept gets an F. My trucks AC problem needed the dealer. I dropped my truck off in the morning and was greeted nicely and that's it for good. I told them all that was wrong and was assured that work would be completed that day after they diagnosed it for one hour labor what?! They told me that they would call me in one hour. No call. Thru the day I called 8X. Left on hold, sent to answering machine, no one could tell me anything! At 4:15! I missed their call but call right back. No luck. I go get my truck. Nothing was done. A wasted day. I could take an apology but just got excuses, denials even showing them my call history.. They giggled and insulted me when I got upset. They were unprofessional with no regard for me or my time. There are many good shops in Woodland there are way better choices than Hobbit</Review><pics>None</pics><Resp>None</Resp>< Gmap_id>

We went in to look at trucks, with the intention of purchasing a vehicle that can town a trailer and hold the family. The truck we test drove and fell in love with had the towing package we were looking for. After applying we were switched to another truck that was supposedly the same, just the 2013 version. Not paying as much attention as we should have we didn't realize, it did not have the towing package or anything we wanted. We did mention to the sales guy after we left, he told us he would throw in a hitch, but he denied it once we brought it up to him.  We were very un-pleased with the overall professionalism and honesty of this dealership, specially after we experienced such great service at our next vehicle purchase a few months later.<//Text>

Absolutely horrible customer service.  Did not want to honor the advertised internet sale price. After getting through that they offered $5,000 less on our trade then 3 other dealers we met with the same day.  Horrible experience, would never go bad!</Review>

Terrible service department. Repeat trips to fix the same tire issue. Repeatedly kept truck overnight without a call. Sales department may be good, but they lack the ability to properly service the volume of trucks they sell.</Text>

Just as promised, the service for my Ram 3500 was done professionally and as quickly as possible. My service writer, Kush had everything ready and waiting when I arrived.<//review>

I have had the worse car buying experience from this dealer. They won't call you back, can't do there jobs at all. I never would buy a car or step foot on this lot again. Everyone should run from this dealership. Poor management. Buying my truck from them was a huge mistake.< /review>

<review>I would definitely advise anybody that are trying to buy a Jeep/Dodge, to NOT GO TO HOBLIT. I went to their location today and the sales man (David Gomez), was very professional, Knowledgeable and very nice to deal with... when the sales manager (David S. Mercer) came to go over the pricing, he was very aggressive and trying to play the sales speech over the price. He was not happy when I told him that I wanted to know the total price with all the fees included, for the 4x4 and FWD Jeep, because this was going to be a cash purchase. He went back to work on the number and he tried to play the back-and-forth game and I told him that I want to pay the advertising price that was online with all the rebates + the fees and I just needed it a simples answer yes or no if could make the deal or not. He got really aggressive on my face and said NO...I can't do that, Came really close to my face, he got all red and showed me the door, and told me to leave. I did leave and went online saw the same car at Elk Grove Dodge, went in and talked to (Coach Hall) internet sales managers, and told him that I want to buy the specific car that I saw online, he gave me the same price that was advertised, no games, professional and very good to do business with. I paid the price same price that I asked HOBLIT. See pictures. The price from HOBLIT was $23116.08 and I asked to be like advertised $21616.08..... the price from Elk Grove Jeep was from the beginning $21630.54.
($1484.54 cheaper at ELK GROVE JEEP)

*I never give reviews to any business, this is my first and I felt that I needed it to do it, because of the level of disrespect the sales manager had towards me as a customer. I own a family business as well and I would never let any of my employees treat a customer like this. I Hope the owner of HOBLIT will take action ant have a talk to all employees, so this won't happen to any other customer.

IF YOU WANT TO PLAY GAMES WITH CAR SALE'S PEOPLE, OR BE DISRESPECTED AS A CUSTOMER,  GO TO HOBLIT IN WOODLAND TALK TO THE SALES MANAGER (David S. Mercer)..... but if you want to buy a car with no games, go to Elk Grove Dodge and talk to "Coach" Hall</review>< gmap_id>

My experience was really great Josh has been absolutely wonderful and helpful. I love the atmosphere of Hoblit Dodge. It was a very pleasant experience. I never felt pressured at anytime . I knew the minute I met Josh I would be back to buy my car.i love my Dodge Challenger
My experience with the finance man Alex was equally as pleasant and informative. The two of them are top notch 3mplloyees and keepers for sure. Inwill most definitely recommend Hoblit Dodge and I will be back if I ever have to buy another car. Lorraine Belknap aSacramento<//Review>

Shady service. Will never go back. Every time I took my truck in for service I felt played. Everything they did was always half a**ed and they didn't service my transfercase as they were asked to leading to a brakedown due to no oil , why take your vehicle there if they're not going to do service correctly</Review>

{'time': 1453313066604, 'text': 'Hi Cynthia,\n\nI am so sorry to hear about how your experience in our service department made you feel. We have taken what you and other customers have said and made many changes over the past few months. We even hired a new service manager who is taking great strides to make sure our work reflects our customer first attitude. I would love to talk to you personally about your experience so that these mistakes can be avoided in the future. Feel free to contact the dealership at anytime and ask for Whitney.\n\nSincerely,\n\nWhitney Hoblit'}< /response>

Its really fun even adults love it 😆 there's a lot of carp, bass, koi and cat  fish in the lake, too. They love to eat bits of bread, but please be sure to not throw bread in if ducks are near, as ducks cannot properly digest bread. There's a large section of the park for older children and a smaller section for younger children, and there is also a little skating area 😄 the park is not very crowded with people, so its still a nice place to go even during social distancing.< /Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNZdKSPZKIYyBLeJYE8sv8oxIpxGR4gZL-wcxfa=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPntUs5mPVebCVwxY391VgFMLg9Gbmh3ZGOipqF=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPsGVnRSjUfCgeGsa1Es6Au1F412DvFANmxps0w=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures></record></dataset><record>

Very nice park to exercise in. It has a small playground, a lot of grass, is next to a pathway around water, and is big enough for running around. 10/10<//text>

Nice quiet park in a soon to be developed area.  They must be conserving water as the back side of the park is dead and dry.</Text>

<text>I’ve been seeing Dr Tyler for over 10 years & he is the best dentist I’ve ever had. He also has the best dental hygienist in his office. Her name is Jean. I’ve been seeing her for over 2 years & she is amazing. SO thorough, a perfectionist, takes her time, is gentle, yet leaves nothing behind that shouldn’t be there! She leaves my mouth feeling like a millions bucks!!! Once you’ve had a cleaning by Jean, you’ll not settle for less.</text>< pics>

Janelle did a great job! Always feel better after spending quality time with my hygienist. She always lets me know where I am doing a good job and areas where I can improve.  It is a great experience being educated and important to be part of the appointment so I can keep my mouth healthy.< /Text>

Best dentist in San Diego. I had a bunch of work done on my teeth, everything feels amazing and great. The hygienist really know their stuff. Janelle is great at what she does, and making you feel comfortable and does a great job explaining what the root cause is. Shay is also a great hygienist and does a great job cleaning. A very friendly staff and now I will tell my whole family and friends to come here. A+< /review>

All the staff are very nice and extremely helpful. They really take the time to make you comfortable and relaxed. They also explain what they are doing so you can understand. I started going to Dr Tyler and his staff when I lived in east county. I have moved to coastal north county but continue to go to this office because how comfortable they make me feel. I highly recommend them!</text>

<review>Great team, great visit. I’ve been here multiple times and each time the people here are always pleasant and accommodating. Doesn’t matter which provider I see, dentist or hygienist. They’re especially thoughtful of my kids needs during their appointments. Highly recommend coming here if you are in the market for a new dentist.< /review>< Date>

I have to say that these three ladies made my visit one to write about. Not only did Melissa cure my gum problem, she made me laugh the entire time she helped me. This is the only dentist I’ve ever been to and these three ladies are the perfect example of why. Thank you for making the dentist fun and being the sweetest people I’ve ever met.< /Review>< Pics>

Granite Hills Dental Team is the most caring, responsive, professional dental team that I have had the pleasure of being in their care. They listen to the patients concerns so that they can formulate the right sequence of care that meets the patient's needs and their budget. I would recommend anyone seeking Dental care to place Granite Hills Dental Team at the top of their list!!<//review>

Let’s face it. The dental office is a place not everyone loves to be at, myself included. But everything turned around for me once I visited Granite Hills Dental Team. Not only are the staff courteous and friendly but they put you at ease as soon as you walk through the door. Having seen the awesome Dr Tyler for some work, I can tell you that I learned more about my dental health in that one visit than in my entire life of going to the dentist. Education and prevention is key!  Melissa, my hygienist, is fabulous and so gentle. If you’re a dental wuss like me, then come and give Granite Hills Dental Team a try! You won’t regret it!<//review>

This is office is always outstanding! Everyone is friendly, honest, professional, time-conscious, thorough, and kind. I firmly believe having a great dentist and hygienist team is ESSENTIAL- you only get one chance to do it right with your teeth! I can honestly say, I go to this office and bring my children here for a reason: they are the BEST!<//Review>

<text>I have been a patient of Granite Hills Dental for at least 23 years under the excellent care of Dr Scharer and now Dr Tyler. Out of all the dentists I've been to through my life, this has been the absolute best. Their equipment is state 9f the art, the staff are all consummate professionals, always friendly and polite.
I have never had to return for faulty work and the dental work and materials always were first rate.
I'm not related to or have any personal relationships with any of them other than as a patient and they are 100% the best. From my first visit back in 1998 I knew it. I feel sorry for others who are forced to use cut rate clinics. These are life decisions. Thank you Dr Scharer, Dr Tyler, and thank you Granite Hills Dental. Two thumbs up.
God bless

The staff here is so friendly, they explained everything, helped me with payment options (I don't have dental insurance) and they have this text message/email appointment reminder that made sure I didn't forget, which I ALWAYS do.  Thanks for my great, clean smile!<//review>

Bruh... $ 5 delivery fee.  Each topping + $ 2.75 + tip.  As a result, you will take overcook pizza in Hollywood  for $ 40 +1hr delivery waiting time + will not receive any discount on the first order. This is my first and last order. Do not recommend.</review>

My son who loves Wingstop enjoyed their baked wings. They have vegan and keto options. The greek salad and sausage, artichoke, pesto pizza were delicious. There are two dine-in tables that can be used. The cashier was friendly, courteous, and attentive to the customers.< /review>

Soooooo...I wanted pizza with my salad and boom found a billboard for Fresh Brothers. Reminded me of Marco's Pizza although the crust at Fresh Brothers is much better... In an Italiano way...thinner and more flavorful. Mmmm mmm gooders I say. Price was $16 for a medium but hey that's L.A. Met my needs and pretty good pizza even the 2nd day in the oven. Marco's please take note because the crust separates from the cheese after the 2nd day instead of holding it all together when eating like Fresh Brothers. One bite and it certainly screams, Fresh!!! Read the top..truth behind the carton box. Dude franchise to Texas... I am my brother's pizza keeper.🤪 Ayyyyeee!</review>

I've been ordering from Fresh Brothers in Hollywood for a few years now, ever since I moved into the neighborhood, and I've noticed a decline in both quality and service.

Several months ago, I ordered a cauliflower crust pizza for delivery. The delivery time was about average, however the pizza was burnt. It was late evening on the weekend, so I didn't bother to reorder.

Just today, I received an email promotion to try their newest pizza. When I tried to order online, I wasn't able to complete the transaction. When I called the shop and explained the situation, I was told that the order did not meet the minimum requirement for delivery, because the coupon code from their email special discounted the total amount to be below the minimum. I asked if they would be able to override this and allow me to order for delivery since the order did exceed the minimum requirement before the coupon, and they said no.

So, long story short, I did not order the pizza. And they did not offer up any other solution. They literally told me that the order did not meet the minimum for delivery, and that was it. With the number of other options in the Hollywood area, I will not be ordering from Fresh Brothers again, nor will I recommend them.

Fresh Brothers, I encourage you to think about your service model from a customer's perspective, and see the experience through their eyes. I also recommend that you consider adding language to both your website and your email promotions, that clearly communicates any such disclaimers.<//review>

<Text>I love Fresh Brothers!! Their dough is super fresh and they toss the pizza right in front of you. My pizza was done in under 5 minutes and was delicious. Very friendly staff and the environment was very family-oriented. Pizza was very generously sized and could feed at least 2 people. I highly recommend going here with friends or family!!</Text><resp>None< /resp>< user>

Omg I wish it was closer to home.  I would be here twice a week.  The chicken wings are excellent, we had the habanero  and lemon pepper, both were delicious. Dear owners, please open a location in San Diego. This place is kinda out of the way and a hole in the wall but as the sign reads they are expanding the restaurant.< /Review>

Fresh toppings(including fresh spinach!) and delicious homemade sauce from Fresh Brothers. I’ve gotten delicious food every time I ordered from here(try the Chicago style with toppings inside the middle crust). It’s consistently the best delivered pizza in town.< /Review>

I'd never heard of Fresh Brothers before I moved to LA, but after living here for a while I've learned to really love their pizza. It's a great option if you are vegan, they make a great vegan cheese and vegan sausage pizza. They're regular pizza is very delicious too. They have great ingredients and the cut their pizza into squares and not a pie cut which reminds me of great pizza in Chicago. Fresh brothers is one of my favorite pizza chains now mainly because they have so many selections to choose from. It can be a little pricey but for the pizza they serve I would much rather choose fresh brothers over domino's or papa John's.</Review>

VEGAN PIZZA! I’m shifting away from all dairy and meat but was still craving pizza. My cheese pizza with vegan sausage did NOT disappoint. And a cauli crust?!! Om nom nom nom. There are no photos because it was just that good. I love that I can satisfy my pizza cravings and satisfy my new dietary needs. Fresh Bros for life!<//Text>

They are right down the street from where I live.  The store has seating and lots of TVs on their walls.  The food is excellent and the service is too.  They have awesome internet specials all the time.  On Monday, the Internet offering was a deep dish Chicago pizza  (my favorite) for $10.  and I am from Chicago!)  The pizza was delicious, but there was a problem.  The paper that the pizza sits on in the box was stuck to the pizza.  It was difficult to lift a piece off of it (it felt like it was glued to it) and when it finally lifted free, some of the pizza was stuck to the paper and/or the paper was stuck to the bottom of the pizza and had to be scraped off.  I wrote them to let them know and it is only reason why they did not get 5 stars.<//Review>

<Rate>5< /Rate><review>I love their vegan pizza and their very close to my apartment in Hollywood so the delivery time was less the 25 mins.

When I orderd my favorite vegan cheese pizza with vegan sausage. I forgot to be more specific about the sausage being vegan, and  the pizza came with real sausage, and though it was my mistake for not being more specific they fixed my order and sent the whole order with vegan sausage in less than the original delivery time.  The manager was so sweet, and the delivery driver was so nice even though he had to make a double trip to my house.

If your looking for vegan eats with great service, Fresh Brothers is the way to go.<//review><gmap_id>0x80c2bf414a43cedd:0xb2333e09e52059ea</gmap_id><resp>None<//resp></record></dataset><record>

Fresh Brothers understands the meaning of customer service and quality. Let me take you to the experience I was blessed with. I strolled into Fresh Brothers on a whim of hunger. After being greeted by the front counter representative, he politely suggested options for me to try. After placing the order, it seemed that the food materialized in front of me. The swift nature of presenting the food to us was outstanding. Then after the first bite it seemed that a little piece of heaven was bestowed upon me. The fresh taste of their all natural mozzerlla soared through my taste buds and I couldn't help but let out a satisfactory groan. And just as fast as the pizza appeared, it was gone.
Through and through, I highly recommend this experience to anyone. Thanks Fresh Brothers.</text>

Amazing! We were looking for a gluten free pizza place for my wife and extended family.  I've never eaten here before but it didn't disappoint.  We had several different kinds of pizza, all gluten free and they were really tasty.  The gluten free chicken bites with sweet chili dipping sauce were a hit too.  Our picky 10 year old was happy too.<//review>

<Review>I came here cause I saw the billboard for the vegan sliders and I wanted them I was super hungry when I got here so you would think they would taste amazing but the tasted overly salted and were like $13 I also got the half lb of vegan tenders that were $12 and they literally brought me out some gardein frozen long chicken nuggets. Disgusting they we're so dry and gross. And the girl that helped me out was so rude. Didn't even smile. Sounded rude when I asked her about things on the menu.

You'll taste the difference in every bite.
There's no skimping on the toppings either. Their  Pizza is probably the best I've ever tasted anywhere else, there's no comparison.< /text>< Name>

<Review>This is a totally awesome place!  I ordered 250 pizzas for a special event and they were fantastic quality and I had a lot of people commenting how good they were.  Sometimes the quality goes down when a large amount of pizza is made but not with Fresh Brother's, they're the bomb!!  Thank you!!!<//Review>< Rate>

<Text>Friends and I ate here during our visit to California and the barbecue chicken pizza was amazing. Wish there was one in Atlanta because I'm craving it again. Highly recommended if you're ever in the area.</Text><time>1445701873283<//time><user_name>DeAndre King<//user_name></record></dataset><record>

<Text>I recently ordered a vegan pizza from the West Hollywood/Bronson Fresh Brothers location but to my surprise, not only did the chef making the pizza NOT wear gloves, the girl making the salads was strangely wearing only one glove on her left hand, all the while answering the dirty phone, using the register and handling dirty money with the same hand (see pic attached).  It was so disgusting and unsanitary. Super disappointing because their vegan pizza is really good but after seeing the unsanitary conditions, I doubt I'd be back.</Text>< user>

The pizza here is so good unlike from any other joint...I'd label it Gourmet Pizza. I always get the triple pepperoni with extra pizza sauce. In fact I only had an issue one time with delivery but the manager Jordan made good on it and it was very fast and prompt. So when Jordan is working, you can count on your order being fulfilled with exceptional service..... Munga Munga<//review>

Wow! Vegan pizzas and desserts!! Daiya cheese. Medium pizza $14-$20, swt knots $3, brownie $3. Yelp check in to get 3 free sweet knots.

Located in/back of Franklin Village.
Pizza, salad, and fun sides like wings, knots, boneless bites and fries.

Friendly staff.

<Review>At first see all the ratings,  (can it really be that great) but now after testing this place out i can definitely say 5 stars is still not enough.This place is amazing. The second you walk they treat you like family. They have a Wonderful staff. James is the most friendliest person you can ever meet, he changes the whole environment. It was our first time here, and trust me, it wont be the last. We order a deep dish pizza with pepperoni, pineapples and jalapeños. My wife wasn't too excited about the deep dish because she doesn't like to much dough, but now you can definitely say that Fresh brothers converted her to a deep dish lover haha. The dough is so light and delicious it was honestly too perfect, everyone has to try it. And definitely don't forget about dessert, sadly i don't remember what it was called but it was these cinnamon knots. So delicious.We will definitely recommend to all friends and family.  Thank you so much for the great experience 🍕💑⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

<Text>My friend invited my over to Fresh Brothers Pizza last night and we had a blast! There were about 10 of us and it was a great way to catch up with old friends, meet new people and eat LOTS AND LOTS OF PIZZA!

I would like to thank Debbie Goldberg for being the hostess with the mostess! She made sure that our drinks were always full and most importantly she made sure that our rather large party had plenty to eat.

Mission Accomplished!!  It has been 12 hours since I ate any food and I am still in a Pizza Coma!

So lets talk about the Fresh Brothers location itself. It is Hollywood so there is a lot of traffic and the spots in the parking lot go quickly. I rode my bike so I was able to park right in front.

This place has a lot of tv's. When I was done counting them, I found two more in the bathroom so I think the total is like 15 flatscreens for a pretty small location. I thought it was awesome! They have two tv's that point outside so you can watch tv if you are standing in front of the building.. Even more awesome!

The food was awesome. Let me take you through what I ate:

We had the fresh knots and wings. The knots were very good and they are described like this. Garlic bread tied in tasty knots, dusted with parmesan, pizza sauce on the side

After the appetizers came out, then came out the salads. I dove into the BBQ Chicken Salad  and it was very yummy. It was very fresh and here are the ingredients for that. Barbecued chicken breast over a tasty bed of romaine, cheddar cheese, corn, zesty onions and black beans topped with fried onions.

The final course was the pizzas and there was plenty to go around. To be honest, I don't know how many kinds of pizza's were out there but they were all called. My friend Dimple has a custom pizza made for her which has Sausage, Pepperoni and Red Onions on it. I think I might have liked it the best. I hope to see the Dimple Special on the menu sometime soon..

The Bottom Line: The food here is awesome and they have 10 locations throughout Los Angeles. I would recommend trying any of them!</Text><user_name>Bower Louber< /user_name>< GmapID>

ALEX IS AN ABSOLUTE CROOK......DO NOT TRUST THESE GUYS! We just moved to CA and this is my first ever new car. We came in about a week ago, spoke to Alex and asked for tint no darker than CA legal limits specifying I did not want to get pulled over. I MADE sure he understood the importance of that and he very kindly agreed. This was the MOST important thing to me because with how things are in the world today I’m not comfortable at all with being pulled over by a police officer. We paid $170 and were told to be back after an hour. We came back a couple hours later to pick it up and headed out. Upon driving it home I notice it’s a little hard to see out of, so my boyfriend measures the front brow and it comes inches past the legal mark on the windshield. It’s late and I have a busy week so we decide to wait until I have time to address it.

Fast forward about a week or so and BOOM I’m pulled over going to work. Im in the position I feared most and had pleaded Alex to assure me I wouldn’t be in. The officer tells me that not only is the ‘brow’ not only too big but it’s illegal period in CA AND....wait for it THE FRONT WINDOWS ARE ILLEGAL TOO!!! I’m completely baffled and outraged at this point. I’m almost an hour late to work after this, trying to gather my emotions.

Fast forward to earlier today, I’ve had to travel up north for a family emergency and my boyfriend(who paid Alex) calls and it rings then goes to voicemail. He leaves a message to have him call him back today as soon as possible because there was an issue. It must be just a mobile phone because he almost immediately text replies back with ‘Can I call you later?’. I will attach the following couple of messages, in response, from my bf in in a screenshot. As you can see he immediately ‘read’ the first message and NEVER called NOR replied to him. So he disputed the charge and here we are on my first stop to tell everyone that wants to listen NOT TO TRUST THIS PLACE.</text>

I have been here six different times and every single time Alex has taken care of all my vehicles. No matter how expensive the car!

My current vehicle was tinted 3 years ago by Alex and it’s still looks like he tinted it yesterday.

I recommend him to all my family and friends! They have not once complained about his customer service and his work.

Thank you Alex!!!<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None< /Response>< Gmap_id>

He was polite and fast. Area of work was a bit sketchy but clean. Relatively cheap at $130 however you get what you pay for.

Now for the bad portion of the review;

The online photo was not accurate to what the area actually looks like. Advertised nice suite at a shopping center and ended up a garage behind a shop on union ave.
Clean but hard to get to.
The work it self as far as the cut and stick was good, however the problem was the dirt from the windows wasn't properly cleaned and the film attained copious amounts of dust from the window because of it. The door window panels weren't removed to lengthen the film to insure no peeling. End result was relatively good work ruined by lazy work ethic on cleaning dust off windows before applying product. and not properly installing door windows.

Recommendations:

1)Clean windows!
2) Take protecting layer off inside the car not outside to avoid dust collection.
3) if your going to measure using outside window to measure, properly clean that too before touching film to it.
4) if you want word to spread about your business you need to supply good business to bring back costumers for repeat business and to tell others. Good luck in your endeavors. As for this costumer I won't be returning.</Text>

<Review>The place was supposed to open at 8am and it's already close to 9:30am and the owner keeps texting me saying he's almost here and there is a locked gate and I am not able to enter. There are other cars parked outside on the curb as well WAITING. Seems pretty unprofessional. At least give me an EXACT time of when you are arriving so I can run all my errands and come back. Beyond irritated! Then he texts me saying he's got a personal life and another business and stuff. I don't see how any of that was my problem but if he cannot manage the time with his "personal life" and "other business" he should adjust the hours so people aren't wasting their gas and time! I respect the hustle and understand things come up but better communication would have made this situation so much better</Review><name>Alyssa Breann</name><Rating>1< /Rating><Gmap_id>0x80ea6beeb4b35427:0x527fce5bb753f4c4< /Gmap_id><user>115799410515962681114<//user><Pics>None</Pics></record>

<username>Sarah< /username><review>I have been taking all of my vehicles for the past 4 years. I am in the business of flipping cars and most of them need tinting done because of the bakersfield heat. Alex has become a good friend to me and not only does he do great work, he also is very communicative when I am in need of his tinting expertise service. He has always responded very quickly and is very punctual. It is common courtesy to contact him before just going to his shop because he  does have more to his business than just cars to tint. He begins at 8am also to complete work on residential homes and also, commercial building who hires him. He does take walk-ins, but atleast call first, so you can better plan your schedule and also, so you let him plan his as well. It's common curteousy to call first and check his availability. Knowing how all my dozen or so experiences have gone with this business, some people on here leaving reviews must be plain miserable. I bet nothing ever pleases them and they probably expect everyone to bow down to their petty selves, making all servicers of businesses bend over backwards for them to have what they want when they want. These people are not very nice to say what they did. I wouldn't go anywhere else for this service, hands down best deal and best guy to let work on your car. Trustworthy and kind with deligence to get every job done flawlessy. Never have i ever had to go back, never any bubbles, just perfection at great prices. And he is very quick and professional at what he does. I have enjoyed the company for the many vehicles he has tinted for me. Thank you Alex and keep it up, you are a prime example for human kindness. I wish you luck in all your life's endeavors. You are a very special person. And you shine continue to shine bright. Bakersfield is a soul sucking city that welcomes toxic people and loves to see them wallow in their own misery. Love and light, my friend. God bless.< /review>< resp>

<username>Jose Hinojosa</username><review>I went to him in December to get my Honda civic's two front windows tinted, and let me tell you, Alex was super fast and super cheap and my windows look awesome!! If you need your windows tinted I really recommend you go here, the quality of work done is superb and far superior to any others that you will go to. Save time AND money, go to Hills Window Tinting! I guarantee you will be 100% satisfied.</review>< userid>

I was looking to get the windows tinted on my car and after seeing the reviews I decided to try this place. After calling for a rather long period and no one answering , I decided to stop by . At 8:30  they were still closed . I asked a person their if he knew what was going on and it took him all tge effort in tge world to even acknowledge my presence . He decided not to stop his work and shout answers of which  I couldnt hear so I left . A few minutes later I got a call back from the owner asking me to come back by after he got done whatever he was doing . Given the time management issues I decided to go any where else. Customer service and time management are nonexistent here and im not going to wait around all day for you to get to me after doing chores .  So I went somewhere else , got helped with a price and made my apointment for the next day  with no issues right away . Take note Hills window tinting and apply some customer service.<//Review>

< Review>
Today is September 26, 2015 and I just got my windows tinted by Alex here at Hills Window Tinting and they turned out AMAZING! Who would have thought that window tinting can look so good haha! Its right across the street from the kern county fairgrounds and the price is AMAZING compared to all other shops. This was the most affordable that I found in town and I am not dissapointed. The outside is a little rough around the edges especially since its across the street from the fairgrounds, but DONT LET THAT FOOL YOU! To be honest I was a little iffy because the price was almost to good to be true for great quality work and the outside appearance made me wanna go to a big name shop to get it done, but I am SOOOO glad I didnt haha! I have learned not judge a book by its cover. Alex is the perfect combination of business and friendly. He is so nice and explains everything in detail. Great customer service and gets it done in half the time of other shops that I have called for a fraction of the cost (depending on what you want) still affordable and WORTH IT! Highly recommend to others! You wont be disappointed I promise!</Review>

Great service today. Drinks topped off and plates delivered promptly.

Ordered a make-your-own pasta and spaghetti/meatballs. The custom pasta turned out to be very good. The spaghetti with red sauce was just average. I did add a Caesars salad. Didn't know it was unlimited until I joked about getting another. Server did delivery another. To quote Homer Pyle, "Surprise, surprise, surprise."

I will say portions are large, so go hungry.<//Text>

<userid>100845305230816005405</userid><Text>The employee didn't pack the oil and vinegar for the bread. Didn't say anything about it. When I asked, she said they ran out yesterday. I don't think the traffic is high enough that they run out of oil and vinegar on a weekday. Liars in my opinion.
The actual food was good on taste and quantity.

I didn't say earlier but I have had items missing in the order before too, that's why I checked this time.

So my advice is to check your order for completeness before you walk out of the restaurant.</Text><response>{'time': 1600359407410, 'text': "Thank you for the great review!

I just got my veg pizza and pasta with arabatta sauce home. I felt the need to post this review as soon as I finished eating. It's the worst pizza I have ever eaten. It felt like it was frozen and reheated! Definitely not fresh. The pasta had huge chunks of garlic(unminced) and the sauce was separated. I make better pasta at home! Felt like I was on Gordon Ramsay's kitchen nightmares episode. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE AT ALL! I feel horrible after eating it argh!</review>

A great experience, especially with the covid-safe outdoor settings.
On Wednesday nights there is live music, which makes the atmosphere really enjoyable.<//review>

Really enjoyed the food. Really nice ambience and very friendly staffs. Been here for lunch and we ordered pastas. They have good varieties of pastas and pizzas. There were some more in the menu, but we did not checked anything other than pizzas and pastas. If you don’t like their options we can create our on pasta by choosing all the ingredients. They also have good list of wines and other soft drinks. It was not that crowded. It can accommodate plenty of people. You do not have to worry about the seatings. Parking is also not an issue as there are not much shops over that area.</Text>

The happy hour at this unique location is incredible! The prices are fantastic and the cocktail options are superb and artisan.

The nod to David Lynch in the corner was such a nice touch. A very cool atmosphere with neon lighting and comfortable seating.<//Text>

Food was absolutely amazing, but I was slightly turned off by my most recent experience when our server told us complimentary bread could not be brought out with our salads and could only be served with our main plates. The server said this was a new 'restaurant policy'. If this is true, this will be the first time in my life food is held back in defiance of customer expectations. I have no idea why a restaurant would control when food is served to customers. We have not returned to this restaurant since we were informed of this new policy. The server lacked friendliness and seemed to not be mentally committed to the job at hand.<//text>

Love the food here everytime! The build your own pasta option is great as we look for veggie options. Tiramisu here is one the best we've ever had in the bay area.</Review>

Our experience with Macaroni Grill was not good. We were not given napkins, cutlers even when the food came. We need to ask another server to get these. We didn’t get salt/paper too even after asking multiple times. Again we need to ask another server. Food was good, however we were sick of sloppy service by our server 🙁let me find receipt and upload.
Uploaded the receipt, server name is on that.<//Text>

Rather rude experience today while trying to do a curbside pickup. I called upon arrival. The food was ready but they refused to step outside for curbside pick up because we did not click that option 2 hours back on the web.
Upon requesting for a curbside pick up at that time I got a rude refusal!
Not the best of experience.< /Text>

<review>No one was rude. It was a tough night, I can't say it is regularly how they run. Water was spilled on our table as it was served. It took more than 5 minutes after bring seated for server to come by. Food was put very long after order. (Only about 5 tables were occupied.) One of our orders had metal in it. (Guessing a piece of scrubbing pad). Chew your food. Manager did comp meal and was very polite.< /review>< Pictures>

The food was excellent as usual but the service sucked for a Friday night out with his friends. It took quite a while for us to get seated and conceded it took even longer to get water for the table. The restaurant was abnormally empty for a Friday night so there is some confusion as to why the service quality had declined. But for the sake of the food I would go back to this location.<//Review>

Romano's Macaroni Grill was not that great. The food was just ok and the service was super slow. They definitely need more staff, our waiter was working so many tables, it took him a long time to get back to ours. We had appetizers, the Lobster ravioli, shrimp portofino, pepperoni pizza, and the spaghetti and meatballs. The restaurant itself was beautiful inside, but the food and service did not match, it was ok at best, so we won't be coming back here again.</Text>

The service was ok but the rosemary bread they are famous was not fresh but was hard and had mold growing on it. We noticed couple of other tables also returning their breads. It was disappointing as it is one main reasons I come to macaroni grill. When we asked the server about the incident he just brushed it off and told us that it’s never happened before. The food we ordered again didn’t taste fresh my pasta was cold and had to reheated. Definitely will not be going to this place again.< /review>

Food was overpriced, service was lacking and very unprofessional. Waiter called my guest, "babe" and then ma'am after. He was clearly hitting on her and made her very uncomfortable. Waiters came to our table twice with the wrong food. Waited a long time for anything to be served to my table including beverages and bread. The quality of the food was okay. Bathroom was filthy.</review>

Enjoyed dinner very much. It's a good size portion for the build your own pasta. I had capellini with a pomodorina sauce, roasted garlic, roasted mushrooms and sundried tomatoes with ricotta meatballs and smoked provolone. It was excellent. We had a coupon for buy one pasta build and get one free. Had enough leftovers for a 2nd meal.</Text>

<Text>Huge disappointment. We had a party of 15 going to the restaurant with a reservation. We didn't get a waiter until around 15 minutes for some reason. We ordered our drinks and appetizers and that came out. However, they didn't provide us with utensils or plates until after asking 3 times. We then ordered our meals after waiting another 15 minutes for a waiter to take our orders.  We ordered 5 Steak and Potatoes only for the waiter to tell us that they had 1 normal steak left and that they would have to use porterhouse steaks instead. One of us tried to get the steaks at the same price, but we couldn't get it at the normal steak price so 4 of us had to change our orders. The food came out at a comfortable pace, but there weren't any potatoes for the steak and potatoes, which the waiter didn't notify us about. Another complaint was that a person ordered pork chops, but it was pink when it should have been completely cooked. The restaurant took that off the bill. Overall, the experience was not great and the service was satisfactory.
TLDR: Slow service, no normal steaks and no potatoes for the steak and potatoes, and  a pork chop that was not fully cooked.</Text><Gmap_id>0x808fc8df6b0d67af:0x9d419fde15e00c1f< /Gmap_id><username>Kendrick Lam</username>< Rating>

<userid>106024009791965583347<//userid><pics>None</pics><Review>I recently ordered food for delivery. I ordered a pasta dish with roasted chicken. The chicken was dry and hard. It was so over cooked it was unedible. I had to pick out all the chicken and throw it out. I wasted my money ordering from here.

Never ordering again.< /Review>< rate>

Great place to sit down for a filling meal. Food was delish and our servers were mindful to come by often to check on us. Odd thing about this place was the center aisle walkway. You had the navigate through servers as walk through the restaurant. Also, they had politics on the televisions (distasteful in my opinion). Otherwise, overall it was a good experience but not 5 star worthy.<//Text>

You had no record of my confirmed online reservation. Bathroom hand paper towels for Christmas dinner seem tacky. The service was awfull. We expected the advertised special dinner menu and were told everything was sold out. I had to find my own vinegar to use at my table. I had to find my own pepper for my Cesar salad. Server never checked with us about our meal.

I used to dine at Macaroni grill weekly some years ago. I guess restaurant has go downhill in recent times.</review>

<Review>It's been an all-time favorite restaurant of mine since they opened. I've never had anything bad to say until tonight. Bread was stale. Waiter didn't know the menu and told us that the side with the pork chops was a veggie, so my husband got an additional side of potatoes, then the side turned out to be a rice dish. Bar didn't know how to make a make a Mai Tai.  Even my Caesar salad had very little lettuce and way too much dressing</Review>< user_name>

<review>It was fair or more so less than, in comparison to the quality of the food we are use to there. Soup cold, 1st loaf of bread hard like it was reheated in a microwave.  We did receive a new hot bowl of soup and fresh bread,  waiter provided very good service.
The bathroom had no paper towels or dryer for our hands. Note this wasn't a rush hour dinner time, it was slow. Also, the entrees was mediocre, the texture and taste was almost tasteless!  We r very disappointed and this was one of our favorite restaurants.<//review>< rate>

<text>Update: Romano's responded to this review stating they wanted to hear more about my experience and asked me to go to their website and fill out information.  I did this and have received no phone call nor any email response.  So, clearly just a social media monitor responding that has no power to actually fix the situation.

Not what it used to be.

Overpriced for what it is.

Waiter was less than thrilled to be serving us.

Nonetheless, the food was pretty good.</text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

This is not the same place that it used to be. I was here recently on a Friday evening and the tables were 50% full, a far cry from the days where people would be waiting to be seated. I was surprised but soon understood the reason. The service here is below par and consistently my waiter and the waiter at the next table messed up our orders. They weren't even apologetic and just brushed off and blamed someone else.
The food quality is ok but they have serious issues that need to be addressed immediately.</text>

Awful customer service. Food was fine but the server had an attitude and seemed more interested in the birthday next to us. We felt neglected and like we annoyed her the entire time we were there. We are not needy or loud customers either.<//text>

Food was good.  Sat solo in bar area at lunch.  Bartender/wait staff was doing multiple duty in restaurant and bar, so service was a little slow to get his attention during the meal.</Review>

On a slow afternoon day, they definitely do not have the bandwidth to take groups of 14 ppl. I went to that restaurant for years since 1999 and never got such a bad , too long a wait...It took over 1h to get drinks , 15 min to get the table setup and 1:45min to get our drinks and 2h for our food... Furthermore some of the pasta was burned !?? What Italian high class restaurant burns pasta...  Suffice to  say being a customer for over 19 years is not what I would have expected.... It's usually such a nice place , now, I'm not so sure they want our patronship...<//review>

<Text>Online ordering will give you one price and you will receive another when you come in. It will also give you an eta which is totally wrong as well. If you question the cashier about it be prepared for a metric ton of attitude and to be blown off.</Text>< Pictures>

The food was decent and our server was great, but this place as a whole has seen better days. The bathroom was an absolute disaster and the atmosphere just had the feeling of a.bad chain restaurant. I worked at a different location 15 years ago and I feel it's been on a downward slide for at least that long, if not longer.< /Text>

I reserved a table for 13 people 2 weeks in advance of dining date & stated we were celebrating a birthday.  Upon arrival at restaurant they had no record of my reservation; however, they were able to break down a table for 20 & accommodate us.  I placed birthday decorations around the table.  One of the managers & the server knew who the birthday person was.  We had drinks, appetizers and entrees.  While seated the table behind us had employees who sang Happy Birthday in Italian to someone, so I assumed the same would be done at our table.  The food was great, but not sure what happened after that but we had to chase the server down to order a bottle of wine, then we flagged down a different server to come around with fresh parmesan cheese.  No one came by to refill water, no one came by after entrees were served to ask if all was okay.  Then we waited a good 10 minutes after eating to see if a birthday dessert and song would take place, but never happened, our server continued to walk by to attend to other tables and then we finally got his attention to bring the check.  reservation was 7:30 and it was almost 10:30 when we left.  Our tab was $500  and I was happy that gratuity was not included.  Usually we tip good service with 20+%, but not this time.  Food was good but still a little pricey for Italian food.<//Text>

<text>This place use to be really good. Don't know what happened but things have gone downhill drastically. The food is expensive, the chefs in the kitchen just doesn't care about what plating.

< Review>
Had dinner here on Friday. The food was way way to salty. The olive oil they offer for the bread was so sower. Our main dishes were so salty we didn't even finish our food. I believe the cleanliness of any restaurant bathroom says a lot about the restaurant. That being said the woman's bathroom was disgusting! It smelled so bad and there was some weird white liquid smeared over the inside of the bathroom stall. It's been 5 days since our visit and my husband still has stomach issues from the lamb shank he had. NEVER EVER eating here again!< /Review>

Our family really loves this place. We have been regular patrons since 2011. It's our first choice when we are in the mood of Italian food, on a budget too. Not crazy expensive. Great service. The ambience is also rustic and cozy with yellow bulbs. The food is always yummy. We are vegetarian and sometimes ask the chef to put something together which is not in the menu and are always taken care of. We love the make your own menu. The kids menu is also good. The bread, free, is divine. We'd pay and drive over just for that. Love love love.</Review>

<text>The 2 stars are for the service before being seated. We had a party of 8 and place was less than half full and the host told us we had to wait 15 minutes because we have 3 parties in front of us, but we were the only ones waiting to be seated. After 30 minutes of waiting and groups of 4 being seatedwe asked the host when will we be seated. The host replied with soon. Then we saw the team push done tables together and we were seated.

<Review>Went there in the late afternoon. I was standing there for few minutes before anyone helped me. The staff weren't busy but no one offered to help. The manager came out later and was very courteous. Food waa average at most. It's been a few years since I last came. I got to say it was disappointing, mostly due to the service quality.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics>< rate>

Terrible service. The server had a super flat personality not very personable. The chicken marsala was way overcooked. It tasted like rubber. I couldn't eat it, and the wine didn't arrive at the table until after the meal (almost). Needless to say, I do not recommend this place.< /text>

< Review>
My wife and I went here for the first time tonight. We waited an hour to be seated which was fine. After being seated, our server asked if we'd like something to drink. We ordered a glass of wine for my wife and a sparkling water for myself. It took 15 minutes for the drinks and he served us regular water first, one in a half broken glass!!!  The entire time the server handed everything from behind a bar rail. The soup was cold and the pizza crust was raw as was the second pizza. What a way to dine on Christmas night. We got up and left as others dining were having similar issues. Not recommended and will not be going back.< /Review>

Great service. All the staff are nice, polite, and very helpful. However, the food here is pretty awful. Especially anything with bread. The chicken dish wasn't too bad, but avoid the pizza at all costs. The house bread smelled great. It was soft and served warm like it should be. But again, tasted bad. That being said, prices are very affordable.< /review>

Was not a fan of this location. The bathrooms are disgusting and covered in political propaganda graffiti. The waiters fingernails were dirty and long.. Yuck. The restaurant was cold, dark and uninviting.

<review>Romano's Grill remains the only time in my memory that the quality of the meal decreased over time. It started with nice service, followed by fantastic appetizers. Small peppers stuffed with goat cheese and some pruccetta. The entrees however, fell terribly flat. A pizza that seemed stale, with no crunch or give at all in the crust, and rubbery meat, and pasta  questionable chicken.

As strange as it sounds, I would argue against ordering entrees here, unless I happened to get the two things on the menu they aren't good at.</review>< Pics>

<Text>We arrived for happy hour and sat in
bar area at a table. Jennifer, the bar tender, let us sit waiting for 15 minutes before she brought us a menu. Then another 10 minutes to come over and take our drink order. When the food came it Jennifer delivered part of it and at least 10 minutes later Andrea Link, the service manager, delivered the remaining dishes. I could go on and on about the poor service, but it appeared to us that the restaurant was under staffed in our area. In Jennifer’ Defense, why did she have to deliver food from the kitchen area? This problem could have been taken care with a regular waitress working the tables. Never ate at a Macroni Grill before tonight. If I ever try one again, I hope it has better service. As this one failed miserably.
I’d go back for the happy hour menu, it was excellent. But that was the only highlight of our experience. Wayne<//Text>< pics>

today 2/15/20  was terrible. 5 mins to get somebody attend at arrival. 15 mins waiting to order. the manager then assigns somebody who does not conne finally somebody else comes and start instead of apologizing by stating it's not his fault... blame it on the guy before!!! then 3/4 off meal frozen margarita hasn't yet arrived.  now the story is that and i quite "not my fault i put it in immediately. its the genius at the bar who hasn't started it yet,". when it arrives it is not frozen. they removed the margarita and seemed to have done a gesture. terrible service. the whole meal should have been credited. oh and the place was crawling with waiter but not many occupied tables. it's not that they were overwhelmed!!!!

on 6/1/19, they offer 20 minutes wait when most tables are free! terrible customer service and no efficiency!

the caesar salad that they at to the meal to charge more now came twice with essential no caesar dressing... and the waitress is not happy it was pointed out</review>

The quality is top notch even though it's a chain. They seem to be busy about half the time when we go. You'll end up paying a bit too much but the food is great.

The service had been fine but not stellar each time we visit, which matches our expectations. If you like macaroni grills in general, then you will like this location as they seem to be very consistent.

I'm personally I really big fan of the free bread loaf and their pizza. I always try to save some to take it home but never even make it out the door without eating it all.</Text>

Took my mom there for her birthday.  Mom really enjoyed her meal (make your own pasta) and birthday dessert.  I had something that I was not a fan of, but the manager Lance offer to try something else, I accepted and made my pasta dish it was really good.  Lance is a good dude.  He made my moms birthday special by being so kind and providing good service to us.</Text>

<Name>Gwen Morrison< /Name><Review>We were very underwhelmed by our dinner here. They charge high prices for mediocre Italian food.
To start, we had a hard little loaf of uncut, cold, stale bread brought to us. The waitress never brought any more to us. There's a big bottle of cheap olive oil on every table. The crust on the bread was like a rock.
We had the brussel sprouts as an appetizer because they did not have our first THREE choices of appetizer- said they were all out. The brussel sprouts were quite good, actually.
For entrees, my husband got the Mahi Mahi. He was disappointed. The fish itself was NOT fresh at all, and the pesto was very lacking in flavor, and had way too much cheese. Overall a very bland dish that he didnt want to finish. I had the Butternut Tortellacci with tomato soup, which was a decent meal, but not terribly impressive. The soup was very bland.
We decided not to even try dessert.
The only reason this is three stars instead of two is that the service was very fast.
Number one thing to improve: hire someone who knows how to bake bread, and make it FRESH.< /Review>< GmapID>

<user>116021915099603143374<//user><Text>Good wholesome Italian food with great wine options in a rustic setting. It looks expensive when you walk in, but that's the charm of the place. We were attended to by a very patient host considering our lack of knowledge about the menu options. With fun holiday music playing in the background, we had a great time at Romano's. We're definitely eating here again!</Text>< date>

Food is delicious. Service is great. I have gone a couple of times for my birthday. Sometimes food takes a while(rarely). Jam packed during lunch time. I would comeback every year. Better than Olive Garden just because ambience and service is slightly better. I love this place. Eggplant Parmigiana is the best here.<//Review>

It was the service and selection. I've always loved this restaurant but this wasn't a good trip. The server didn't explain or offer the salad/soup extras had no clue about what they were out of. At about 6-7 pm, should be nothing. We were given menus with different offerings on them they had zero soups available that were actually listed on the menu. We we informed that they were out of things 3 times and one was a main entree. The server didn't even offer a dessert menu. I will probably go to another location at some point but dang, I spent 94 bucks and I didn't even get what I wanted.</Review>

My wife and I originally found the Fresno location. However this restaurant is on point, the food is phenomenal you will not be disappointed. The prices are decent considering it's a really good restaurant with high quality food, and good service. The building is cookie cutter it looks exactly like the Fresno location, without a fireplace only difference I could find even the bathroom looked the same!!! but I'm not knocking it they have a good system and it must work well for them their food is superb my favorite dish is the chicken under a brick, unfortunately it doesn't come served under a brick! it's cooked under a brick and once again it is out of this world!!!<//text>

<Review>Asked for orange soda, got lemon.
Selected roasted mushrooms and got pale, uncooked mushrooms.
Selected broccolini, got two florets and about a dozen chopped stalks.
Selected arabiatta, no discernible spice.
Marsala cream sauce tasted like an Alfredo nothing sauce.

Rosemary bread was delicious.

Maybe a bad night? We’ve had excellent experiences in our hometown, so we were excited to visit an old favorite in a new town. A very disappointing night.< /Review><UserId.>109930012237395456005</UserId.><gmap_id>0x808fc8df6b0d67af:0x9d419fde15e00c1f</gmap_id></record>

Good service, bad food, gross bathrooms.

This place used to be good, but evidently those days are long over. My food was late, but once it arrived, it was plated so horribly it didn't look remotely appetizing. The drinks were over iced and watered down.

It's amazing they've survived all this time but the competition is slim.</text>

We visited with 2 adults and four kids. The location was kid friendly. The staff and service was great and very attentive. There were a wide variety of menu options. The bread that came before the meal was not warm which was a bit disappointing but that was the only negative and it did taste good. Obviously the mac and cheese was good as well as all the other dishes we tried like the ravioli. I will definitely be back to try the rest of the menu.<//Review>

There's never too long of a wait to get your food. It all tastes fresh too. I would recommend making reservations when you go here though. I order the Shrimp Portofino, and it is excellent. If you're a fan of fish you should get the sole. I had a couple gift cards. I got them discounted because Macaroni Grill constantly has specials they run for 20-30% off their gift cards. If you sign up for their club they send you $5 off your next meal, which you can use anytime. I'd recommend signing up for their email club because they frequently send discounts and coupons. Yet another reason I love Macaroni Grill.< /review><user>110124257133055833911</user><Pics>None<//Pics></record>

Father's Day, no reservations. 45 minute wait. Sat in the bar, 5 minutes and we had us a table.

45 minutes after being told 45 minute wait, we're done eating and back on the road.

Bartender super cool, great service, fast food. Plus happy hour pricing on drinks.

Delicious and hearty. These guys rock. 150 miles from the casa & feels like home.< /Review>

Five stars for the food. Two stars for the slow service. Our waitress took forever to bring me my Merlot. We never got a refill on our waters. Got the wrong check sent to our table. Took forever to get a slice of Pumpkin Cheesecake (which was awesome, btw.). Tonight was a comedy of errors. Luckily I was with friends and family that did not mind hanging around and chatting while things got sorted.<//Review>

Really tasty, good food.  And if you get on their mailing list, Macaroni Grill sends weekly deals on their specials. Some are two-for-one meals, and I always bring my friends for those.

Sometimes I'm lucky enough to get Jasmine as our waitress and she is always a delight.<//text>

Service was not good today, the waiter took a long time to come back with bread after being asked. The fettucine alfredo was alright, I had to request cheese but the front desk lady was happy to retrieve some. A so-so encounter, but I have enjoyed meals here before.<//text>

The service from the server was great but the lack of adequate staffing is evident in the wait for seating, the wait between service check-ins, and the rushed approach. The food is just ok so the lack of service makes a big impact.</Review>

<text>Well, I really don't have anything good to say about my visit.  First off,  they don't have the parmesan crusted Sole, which Is the reason i went.  After that,  i ordered chicken scalping, good sauce  rubber chicken.
Also, the silverware was dirty.  The bread didn't come out until half way through the meal.
I used to come here often. But now,  I'll not be returning.<//text><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

Very bad experience. We had to wait a while to be seated, once seated, the waiter wasn't taking our order. The food took forever to come. The pizza we got was ice cold. This is not the same Macaroni Grill we used to love a few months ago. It's gotten much, much worse.<//Text>

< Review>
This review is for a Grubhub delivery.

The food was good and packaged well aside from the oil and vinegar cups for the bread having opened and spilled inside the bag.

I ordered the signature truffle Mac and cheese and crispy mozzarella bites. The crispy mozz bites seemed like they had been way overcooked as they were all hemorrhaging dry, fried mozzarella and the insides were hollow.

My biggest problem however was ordering pasta from a restaurant whose menu consists primarily of pasta dishes, and not getting ANY silverware or napkins. How was this missed?? I had to call down to the front desk of my hotel and have someone bring a fork because no one at Romano's threw one in, and the Grubhub drivers don't stick around long enough to verify an order with the customer.

I disagree with the fundamental trend of sacrificing service for convenience and with a Grubhub delivery, I'm noticing no one takes accountability for an order. Sure, I can call the restaurant, but do I want to wait another 30 minutes for someone to drive back out to make my order right? This is compounded by the fact that my tip is pre-emptively applied so my one method of rewarding good service or highlighting bad is taken away from me.

I think both the restaurant and GH could do better. The restaurant needs to take better care with remote orders and ensure they are all 100% before going out the door, since problem resolution is much more complicated and time consuming; and I think GH as a service provider needs to emphasize *correct* service over *fast* service and incentivize workers at all points in the chain to follow suit.

I'm upset at RMG for not knowing their business and failing to include silverware to a hotel order for a food that *cannot* be eaten with hands, and GH needs to ensure orders that go through their process are correct before eating a customer's time and money. Next time I need to eat, I'll just go sit down at the restaurant. At least then when there's a problem, I can settle it immediately.< /Review>

Great service as always. Their bread is to die for and we always love the "made to order" pasta with lots of veggies. My only negative is that the two pizzas we ordered came cold...it wasn't even warm. They went back and reheated, but it wasn't the same as steaming hot. It was luke warm at best. So my only feedback would be to serve the pizzas hot - if it gets cold, don't bother to reheat but get fresh one.<//text>

Party of six celebrating a birthday.
Service was attentive.
Large white sheets of paper covered the tables,  crayons provided for the young at heart.
For a Wednesday night, it was not crowded at dinner time, approximately 6 p.m.
3 of us had the chicken marsala. 1 had spaghetti and meatballs, shrimp scampi, and another had pasta alfredo.
The food was good, but not great in my humble opinion.
My chicken marsala was good but lacked the depth the marsala sauce typically carries.
The others in our party did seem pleased with their dish though.
Warm bread was served along with dipping sauce of spices and herbs in olive oil and balsamic vinegar may also be added.
It was very good.
The ladies room could be a bit more clean, and parking lot had a lot more cars than patrons.
We thought the place was packed judging by the cars in the lot near the entrance into the restaurant,  but only a couple of seated patrons.
Choice of chocolate cake or baked cheesecake with sliced strawberries on the side for the birthday girl.
I will most likely return to try another dish sometime in the future.< /Text>

When my wife and I were first married, we used to save so we could go to one of our favorite places-Romano's Macaroni Grill! Then we moved away from any locations and have missed it.  Traveling through the area today, we were excited to see a RMG! We saw the reviews, but thought that surely they must be mistaken, this is Romano's after all...right?  Here's our experience.  The greeter was very friendly and courteous to us throughout the visit.  He greeted us warmly when we entered, came and chatted briefly with us while we were waiting for our food, and opened the door for us when we left.  The server was alright as well.  But, that's where the positives ended.  Granted, I am comparing things with a memory, but if this is indicative of current practices, things have definitely changed.  The oil and basalmic poured out with the appetizer bread that used to be served have been replaced by some oil and pepper.  The small loaf was cold and hard.  My shoes stuck to the floor around our table.  The restroom was dirty and in need of repair.  Gone was the music piped into the restaurant and the atmosphere that was created there in the past.  When the food arrived, I thought the chicken I ate was off for some reason.  After a couple of bites I realized what it was.  It tasted exactly like the chicken that is reconstituted after being frozen in a microwave dinner.  I didn't eat any more of it.  The pasta was well cooked, but the sauces were lacking.  To cap it off, a family member who has the chicken parmesan came home with a very upset stomach.  I still don't want to give up on RMG, with so many GOOD memories from the past.  But I'm left with the impression that I should leave my experiences with RMG at that, the good memories.  Disappointing to say the least.<//Review>

There was a slightly more quiet dining area in the bar area that would have been my preference, when available. The open kitchen was interesting to see, although a little noisy, but part of the experience. They dealt nicely with food allergies and during our order easily allowed us to switch out the offending food for a safe alternative. I usually eat half my dinners and take half home but the specialty pasta dish was so good, I missed having leftovers. The brussel sprouts were a game changer for holiday dinners. Seriously good food. My in-laws liked the wine offered and ended up buying the whole bottle to take home.</Review><Gmap_id>0x808fc8df6b0d67af:0x9d419fde15e00c1f</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

It was very good and the best Italian food i have ever tasted! I can't believe it didn't get more stars than it did! It is very affordable but quality. Me and my family love it! The only thing is they didn't have bowtie pasta the time I went.</Text>

Good choices with healthy options. However, I would not rely on the calories on the menue. They are often misleadingly lower than reality.< /text>

<review>Seating went fine. Server didn't introduce  himself, didn't ask what we wanted to drink. He came with water which was warm. Most of dinner, it was if we were an after thought. He seemed to be rushed and made us feel like we needed to eat and leave. Subsequent request for water was ignored. Food was ok, not like the Macaroni Grill we remembered. Between the not so great service and the not so great food...maybe this is why other locations have closed.<//review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

<Text>Lovely place. Love the house bread. We keep visiting here often. Big shout out to Lance the manager of this restaurant.He was very warm and made sure we were comfortable.  On an earlier visit, I was told one of the dishes"Chicken under the brick" was out. I had left a comment on this at their website. Lance not only wrote back but gave me a free coupon to get my favorite dish on my next visit. Good service.</Text></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Terrible service, we had to wait so long for our food, and I understand that's not the waiters fault. But in the meantime, he disappeared, left our drinks empty, we had to chase him down, he walked off in the middle of my sentence twice. Food was fantastic, but the service killed it for me.</Review>< pictures>

<name>John St. Pierre<//name><Text>The food was okay. The service was mediocre. I felt like the waiter (an older gentleman) was being condescending, merely tolerating us in his restaurant. I guess these folks fancy themselves a "gourmet Italian restaurant" rather than a cookie-cutter chain that just filed for Bankruptcy last year. This is just a step above Olive Garden, folks. Not bad, but not great, either.</Text>< Gmap_id>

<text>Went after really long time. Food was good, especially the aribiatta resd sauce pasta and fettuccine alfredo.  Service was really bad. One of our pastas didnt come until everyone else was done with their dinner. The server was almost avoiding even looking at us or coming and checking on us or letting us know why the pasta was taking so long. They weren't that full at the time as we went at 6pm and half the restaurant was empty. So would recommend to go there only when time is not a constraint.</text><pics>None</pics>< response>

Late post: We drove from Hayward on a Sunday afternoon for lunch.  Whst a mistake.  We stood at checkin desk for 15 minutes along with 8 other guest.  Finally the bartender came from back and appeared upset.  It took her 5+ minutes to move 2 chairs (only a few tables were occupied).

Eventually someone came to seat us.  Fast forward, my knife was dirty, never washed.  Second set of silver wear was dirty. As we prepared to eat bread, my granddaughter noticed a glob of cheese on bread plate.  I requested to speak with the manager.  She was non caring and offered another plate.  We declined and left, never to return.<//text>

We have been here before and we've had positive experiences
Today our food was good and we enjoy each other's company.
Our waiter didn't do a good job.
1. He never came to check if we needed something
2. Neve offered parmesan cheese
3. Brought the bill without offering dessert.
We have always had  good service before</Text>

Apparently there was a power outage which covered the whole shopping complex the food was delivered. They were not allowing anyone else in they served all of the customers who ordered. Even though they had no control over the situation they continued to apologize eveyone accepted the outage only one table kept saying this is unacceptable they acted as though the crew killed the power but i guess when you feel you are unimportant and you act like you are above everyone else i guess that everything should cater to you the staff went above and beyond in light of the situation</text><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>{'time': 1561064056101, 'text': 'Thank you for sharing your experience, we appreciate the feedback.

The service was very good and very fast. The food  varies from very good to barely passable. I had Osso boccu and was excellent. My date had the porterhouse steak, which burnt on the outside, medium rare on the inside, lots of gristle and fat. And the sauce they put on it was bland. It was the highest priced entree on the menu and a big dissapointment.<//Text>

The service in the bay area is generally pretty poor but this place is a little above average by comparison. Luckily, the food is better than the service and it arrives lightning fast. I find it stunning how quick their kitchen is, even during the dinner rush.<//review>

Food was okay. We got stuck with a server who initially did not show up for almost 20 minutes and then was in a hurry to get us out of there. Luckily the gentleman at reception came by and initially hooked us work drinks and then took care of us at the end. I would advise them to focus on the service as the food is mediocre.</text>

However, the 2nd was supposed to be: Spaghetti & meat sauce w/3 veggies and Ceasar Salad...
Didnt find out until I got home that:
1. They completely left out Roasted Garlic (my Main Want!)
2. They made Angel Hair instead of Spaghetti
3. They packed Ranch (ugh, RAUNCH!) instead of Ceasar dressing< /Review>< Pictures>

<Review>The food was very good, and the portions extremely generous; you'll definitely have leftovers, which makes the slightly high prices worth it. The waitstaff was pleasant and the service was fast - we got our salads about five minutes after we placed our orders, and the entrées arrived before I had even finished my salad. This place also serves fresh baked bread (focaccia) for the table, which was nice and hot. I ordered the classic truffle mac and cheese, which was a little bit spicy (comes with black pepper in it) and very cheesy, but a little drier than I was hoping it would be (I like my mac and cheese very creamy). Overall, this is a nice place that I would visit a few times a year because of the prices and how heavy the food is.</Review>< pics>

<review>EDIT (Jun/2018): This place is decaying fast. It appears their corporate overlords decided that they only want your money and don't care for your experience. On our last visit, we had to wait 40+ minutes to sit, even though the place was about 1/4 full. Empty tables everywhere and no servers to take customers. To me, this indicates a company that wants to keep costs low by employing fewer server than they need. After our wait, we were served by a very disinterested waiter. The free bread (one of the selling points of the place) is still there, but was clearly not fresh as it used to be. They now charge extra for salads and soup. In the end, we spent around 3h+ to have a very dissatisfying experience. I won't be coming back anytime soon. It's a real shame, since the place used to be a good place to eat casually.

OLD REVIEW:
Good "bang for the buck". It's not "authentic" Italian food, but the taste is good. Not super expensive and the setting is very nice for what you pay for. A nice loaf of bread is included as an appetizer when you order any entree.</review>< Pics>

<Review>I ordered mushroom ravioli was so salty，other dishes can only say soso.   It's kind of funny，it's such a big chain resturant， they gave us hot water using many different cup/mugs.  Service is also soso.</Review><user>110358426875643206443< /user>< gmap_id>

I'm NEVER one to complain, but my experience here on 10/7/18 warrants it!!

It was an absolute disaster from the beginning. When we got first got there, we were told that there was approx. 25 min wait for a party of 4... no big thing...

After my personal observation, I noticed that there were several open tables where the recent parties just departed. These tables sat open for 15 mins or more, and then I realized that who ever did the scheduling did not have enough bussers available. I only saw a bus boy cleaning tables.  TALK ABOUT BEING GROSSLY UNDERSTAFFED! C'MON MAN!

After inquiring with the host/manager after 35 mins, we were then seated. The table wasnt prepared, no utensil settings, no glasses... really?!? Being patient, I let it slide...

Waiter eventually came around and took our order after sitting arnd for 10 mins. Again, no utensil settings but we got our drinks... and bread...  but no utensils. I finally had to ask another waiter if we could get some settings...

We placed 3 orders of appetizers; calamari, mac n cheese bites, and fresh mozzarella. Calamari came w/in 10 mins of the initial order. We proceeded to order our main dishes.

Our main dish came in 35 mins w/in ordering it, but the other appetizers havent arrived yet and no explanation... wth?!  After working into our main dish, the remaining appetizers came 42 mins since placing it and 7 mins AFTER the main dish arrived.

After waiting all that time, we really didnt have any appetite to eat any more... would you or any one??? C'MON MAN!

Where is John Taffer when you need him? Good grief, talk about a bootleg operation! C'MON MAN!

If you have time to burn and really dont care about the quality of service, then this is your place. Sadly, for the price that they demand, you're better off cooking the meal yourself without the unwanted stress!!

In my personal observation, this place lacks:
* communication
* integrity
* compassion
* desire

Sadly, we were among 5 other parties who were waiting for service in this bootleg operation. John Taffer would scream out, "you're in the customer service business and your livelihood depends on it!! Are you f$&n crazy?!?"

Needless to say, our party left extremely disappointed. If I was a representative from this corporation and experienced what I went through, there would be a lot of unemployed people with the fear of this place shutting down..

This place is broken and needs help! Sorry to be brutally honest, but I'm pulling for you guys to stay in business...< /review>

The food was phenomenal. We both had the shrimp portofino and it was amazing. Service was great. Only drawback was that it was really loud and noisy. Would definitely recommend eating here.</Review>

<text>Hmmm, this used to be one of my family's favorite places.  I went there for lunch today and was VERY disappointed.  The service was ok,  the bread was hard and stale, the food was just average.  $50 for 2 people for lunch -- was DISAPPOINTING.</text>< Date>

I came for lunch as a small company event for 5 people and the service was sub par.  We were seated promptly on a busy afternoon lunch. The things I want to highlight are that we did not have bread offered to our table.  I ended up requesting the bread which did not arrive until after our appetizers were eaten.  Another issue was that once the bread arrived, our table did not have the black oil condoment. Another issue is that our waitor was reaching across peoples faces while delivering and retrieving plates.  Lastly, I ordered medium cooked lamb chops and two of the three peices of meet were good. Unfortunately the third piece was burned on one side.  The meat was so charred when I bit into it, it tasted like coal.

Asthetically, the area looked over crowded and simply not the best.  The environment may need reevaluation.  On this note, I was not impressed by a paper cover over the table mantles.

I can safely say that this site is understaffed.  We were waited on by 4 different waiters.  I can chalk up the reaching for plates across people as rushing through the task. As for the  burnt food, it's not easy to serve so many at a busy time.  Or maybe training is required for waiters and cooks to emphasize quality of service.

All of this is unfortunate but I wanted to give pinpointed feedback to the site.< /text>

Good food, service varied.   Waiter didn't seem to know it was viniger and oil mix.   Sad thing was watching him change paper on another table, the table cloth underneath was yuck! Looked at ours and just as bad, then curiosity caused us to look at the tables......they should considet revamping...torn/battered with a dash of some unknown blackness?   But good food</Review>

This place has really gone backwards in the last year or so. We were there Sunday night. The restaurant was half empty and we still have to wait 30 mins. The staff told us they were shorthanded. I am not sure how that happens on a weekend. Our waitress then forgot about our bread, and they didn't have 2 out of the 4 entre items that we ordered. Again, I don't know how that happens in such a seasoned restaurant on a weekend. These items are meatball & shrimp of all things. They also brought out the appetitizer and entrees all at the same time on a small table with 4 people. This will be the last time that I will be there.</Text>

Food is OK.   Subpart to other Mac grill.  Pasta was not cooked enough and we're stuck together.  Pasta not recommended.  Steak is good, though.</Review>

I love the restaurant and been going here for 10 years, but the way the person at the take out counter treated me today, was just ridiculous.
1. He picked up my online order from trash.
2. He said it will take few mins for order to be ready even when it was already 30 mins since I had ordered online.
3. While I was waiting, I could see the to-go boxes lying on counter but he still said my order is not ready and that I had to wait few mins more.

After 20 mins waiting at the restaurant he finally picked up the to-go boxes and put them into bag, went in to get the juice and then gave me the bag with the cold food inside.

I reported the same to the manager in the restaurant and she said that she can help refund me the money, but that's not the point I told her and asked her to follow up with the employee.

What I don't understand is what do these working people get by treating the restaurant's customer in such bad way and ruin restaurant's reputation.<//text>

We had Brunch today and have always loved it but today it was not good.  My husband and I ordered Chicken Parm. eggs benedict because we've had it several times and love it.  Not today....no love.  Chicken was kind of burnt on the bottom and hard to cut and the cheese topping was slightly burnt.  Potatoes- which I love were not very hot and not loved either.  Our friends did not say much since we had raved about brunch there but I knew they weren't happy.  It was all in all very disappointing.  Last Saturday we had a delish dinner and are planning on catering our anniversary party next month with Macaroni Grill. I hope this was just a fluke today :((<//text>

Get Italian Tapas for $9 - that is the best value.
In my case, the waiter was very courteous; however took a long time to get the check and the card back.< /text>

1.We walked in and instantly where given a table for 7. 2. They did make a mistake about what food to bring to someone at the table but handled it well and gave them the food on  the house and a free desert. Over all they had grate service and food.<//review>

I usually like this place for taste and service as well! The ambience is great, quick lunch menu is nice option on working day.. the bar has some good collection! But there are specific items which one should try and should not even think about it.. the one that never disappoints is Pollo Caprese! This is all time favorite..pasta Milano (which is removed from menu but can be made on request) is good when you’ve large appetite! Seafood is bit risky.. it’s not fresh & lobster ravioli is a big NO!   Kids will love Margarita pizza and so is their spicy sauce - arabiata! It’s much better than regular marinara!< /Text>

<username>B Brown<//username><time>1480096335126< /time><rate>3< /rate><Review>Went there for the first time yesterday for Thanksgiving with my niece. We ordered the lobster ravioli, meatballs, Plus the calamari. Now this is the first time I've been to the Milpitas restaurants I normally go to the El Cerrito restaurant. The lobster ravioli was a little flat from me. They didn't put enough cheese on my ravioli I'm used to the server coming to the table with the cheese grater asking if we needed more cheese on top of our ravioli. Not enough Lobster claw inside the ravioli. Too many tomatoes. it could have been a little fuller with lobster claw.   like they do in El Cerrito. But my niece's ordered a glass of champagne, Now I'm not a champagne drinking kind of person but this campaign that she ordered looked good, and refreshing. So I decided to order me a glass also.WOW!!! That was some good ass champagne. I really don't care for champagne but this campaign was really good not too dry and a very nice aftertaste. I forgot the name of the champagne. I'm going to call my niece and have her give me the name of that champagne I might just end up getting a bottle of this champagne for myself.<//Review>< pics>

<Text>My second trip here for the mushroom ravioli, it's really good, even i am not a vegan, i really love it. The Caesar side salad was great with croutons. Love the croutons.
For antipasta, i had calamari fritti, it's just okay, not impressive. Their house bread is the worst, tasteless and hard, red lobster and texas roadhouse have way better house bread.
I had penne rustica this round, it's very flavorful, lot of shrimps, bacon and roasted chicken, like the slightly burnt cheese in top, but too salty, that's why i just gave four stars.<//Text><UserId.>105682585424358752913<//UserId.><Rate>4< /Rate>< Pictures>

<Review>Consumer Picks 2016 #1 Italian Restaurant. Always abuzz with life and chatter. There is energy in this place as soon as you enter. Get the fresh bread on the table and the crayons for the kids and you are set to get started on the meal. Portions are hearty and service is quick and snappy. Lots of vegetarian options. Child friendly and child sound proof :) Must try dishes: Goat cheese peppadew peppers, portobello fries, Butternut Asiago Tortellaci.<//Review>< Pics>
