So i ordered at 5:15. Its currently 5:36. Still no sandwich. One singular sandwich. Like 6 people that ordered after me have all gotten their food. Good thing I'm not a truck driver or anything.<//Review>

This restaurant is certainly one of the tastiest place to eat in the region. Every time I visit this place I am greatly happy. They preserve their very high  level service and the topmost level of meals  they give. You no doubt will love this place. Highly  recommended.<//text>

For all of the COVID safety extremists, the inside is adjoined to the gas station convenience store and the dining area is cleared out to provide plenty of room to stay 6 (...dare I say 8-10) feet apart from any other human.< /Review>< pictures>

Slowest Wendy's I think I've ever been to. 8pm and 3 cars in front of us, took 15 min to even get to the window. Got our food, checked the bags and left. Go to eat our food only to find out the fries and nuggets were COLD! Very disappointing, especially since we wasted $20 on it, pitiful excuse for a "fast" food restaurant, at least this location!!!</review>

So it says open for 24 hrs. Drive thru person said it was closed. Everybody I talked to in area says they should be open and that they just tell people there closed and don’t like to do there job. Sucks. Hardly anywhere to eat in area.16 hr work day. Thanks Wendy’s it was a little before 11pm.<//Review>

<Review>Could only order from one side of the menu then paid 12 bucks for chicken sandwich combo to get cold fries. You got really got to stop trying to get over on truck drivers when you feel like we won’t notice. Then waited 5 mins for someone to come back just to fix my order. By the time I got fresh fries, my sandwich was cold. Promise I won’t bother you ever again< /Review>< user_id>

If you saw the prices on this menu you would think you were in an airport. The employees handle money then food without washing their hands. Do yourself a favor and keep driving 10 minutes and get some fast food which won't cost you $15 a person.<//Review>

Waited in the drive through for 20+ minutes because my kids chicken nuggets weren't dropped for their kids meals, once I drove away and started eating my lettuce wrapped Dave's double, I got a bite full of mustard, which I had ordered a lettuce wrapped Dave's double without sauce and without onions 🤦< /review>

I was here for their grand opening and i was here a year or so later, last night.
I ordered a chicken sandwich and i've had food poisoning so bad that my boss has to send someone over to drive my truck.
The midnight Tues-Wed crew just about killed me.</review>

Open 24 hours, sure, but the grill is shut down every night from like 11pm to 5am "for cleaning" so no burgers at night, just microwaved chicken. Staff has gotten better since launch but I've still received entirely wrong orders with no sauce. I've resorted to not eating from fast food in Lebec and Gorman, as the McDonald's in Gorman and this Wendy's seem to have had the same bad staff at one time or another.< /Review>

Ok, so left Jack n the box down the road, for Wendy's. Same thing here, only one person wearing gloves. The lady was handling food with bare hands. So ended spending money on an bear claw and chips for dinner.< /text>

Accidentally ordered my starbucks drink to another location through the app but the employees were kind enough to cancel that order and get it for me at the correct location.</text>

<Review>I drove by many Starbucks while running errands. ALL of them had a LONG drive thru line. I  found this location near Hermosa Beach area off Artesia Blvd. No drive thru ( there was a sign that said  Drive thru but it wasn't being used) 🤔There were only a few people in line inside the store. I'm glad I stopped. Every now and then you have to get out of your car 😂</Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPP3FZnWlaQa2EXKm9Q1odMDyhykba7VTzSfxlN=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN1djpuBuKc3KfR8vOXG8VE-0Ftj4Cp13xQXQxF=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNJRz6ZmbqOBsLhuFp7NejTQTErIGLY6A5OSIcF=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics><Gmap_id>0x80c2b462fc56a8c5:0x121c1c6ef3c587c4<//Gmap_id><user_id>109480365430275054457< /user_id>< Rate>

Quick and friendly employees but the parking lot and entrance/exit is a huge turn off for me with this particular location. The only exit (unless you go the 'wrong way' out the entrance on Flager) is treacherous. It's a steep driveway (so you have to take it slow) and the cars that park on the street block you from seeing the oncoming traffic on Artesia.. you have to inch out and then you get honked out by the speeding cars. No thanks! I only go here if it's off hours and I'm not in a hurry.</text>

10-minute wait for a mobile order that was placed 10 minutes prior. It would’ve been faster to order directly in the store. Plus there isn’t much room to practice social distancing with lots of people waiting for their mobile order. Avoid that location if you can.<//Text>

<Review>As far as Starbucks go, this one is just what you might expect, albeit slightly smaller than most other Starbucks. Nothing was unsatisfactory and yet, nothing stood out to me that would cause me to rate this location higher than any other Starbucks I've been to. It's a great place to get out and study at if you live in the area.<//Review><response>None< /response>< Pictures>

Got my coffee here today. The place wasn't too busy so it didn't tool them too long to make the coffee. They didn't have my favorite Panini and that was kind of a disappointment, but still a good Starbucks.</review>

Mobile App says they don't have Cold brew. But when I walk in, they have Cold brew all the time.
And moreover in the evening time, crew is not listening to what I customize the order all the time. And also we both (myself and my wife) had a bad experience that they asked me why you guys complain all the time instead order differently which is good. But we usually customize the same Cold brew all the time and we had good Cold Brew all the time in the morning time in the same location.

we had bad experience only with the evening shift people in that store. rest of the time we had good time.</Text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Review>Great service. Coming from a former 6 yr Starbucks partner, it's very hard to find stores that really go above and beyond what is expected of them. Young guy, with shaggy blonde hair, completely went beyond what was expected of him. His eagerness to take my drink order, execute it, prepare it, and remembered to call me by my name as we said good bye and departed... totally made my morning. I come to this location periodically, and because of how this guy made me feel, I will be back again sooner than normal.</Review>< pics>

Small store, there espresso machine machines are never calibrated correctly. This means your latte taste like burnt coffee.</Review>

I go to starbucks, I ask for no sugar for my chai tea. They put in sugar. I do not like to have added sugar to my drinks. I do not like this place because I expect it to be quiet not to be a place like Barnes and Nobles where you blast music into a persons ears. Trying to watch a movie the next thing that happened is that it won't load. Worst experience at a starbucks ever. I was trying to do my homework but know I am back to square one with a lot of time wasted from going to this Starbucks. One word to describe my experience BAD.</review>

Live down the street from them and I stop by when I'm out walking. Being disabled has had to cut down my visit unfortunately wonder if they offer a discount to the elderly or disabled. Anyway great staff and are very friendly.<//Text>

Awesome Mexican food, most authentic for our area of the world. Especially if you love seafood. Good service. Location and ambiance aren’t amazing, but so worth a try regardless.</text>

<review>I wanted Mexican seafood for breakfast and this place really delivered.  The crab enchiladas had so much crabmeat, with a nice sauce that managed to balance creaminess and a little bit of citrus kick. The shrimp cocktail such generous seafood portions too. I wish I had time to come back and try more things on their menu but my visit to Eureka was so short. Service was quick and polite and they serve you a basket of tortilla chips, beans, and salsas while you wait for your meal.<//review><Gmap_id>0x54d1557f12f24015:0xb296c90be4ead15d<//Gmap_id><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN5FUAjd1MhYzMJtNZVNWuKdc_4ci8rLDxQS9-j=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMPyfyTNyxTD71d6nfARjgfPnXYV7lGKJKSs6ir=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPYzfYpBISdS3cTkD25984ce4b3kqQiW0v4pEMm=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures>< Time>

Worst food I have EVER had. No flavor, completely dipped in grease! Food instantly hurt my stomach couldn’t even eat it had to leave it there. That was $150 spent on the worst meal of my life for me and my family!< /review>

We ordered one of the seafood bowls, and it was some of the best cooked seafood we've had. Well seasoned and super tender and plenty for two to share! The margaritas are made fresh, and they are very generous with their pours 😉 Overall, the best Mexican restaurant we've tried in Eureka!< /Text>

<Review>Generous portions of authentic, flavorful foods delivered right to my front door. Hands down one of the best places to get real Mexican food. Real deal. I like the carnitas plate. (And they deliver margaritas too)</Review><gmapID>0x54d1557f12f24015:0xb296c90be4ead15d<//gmapID>< username>

The selection is great off of the menu. I had the bacon wrapped shrimp, others in the party had carne asada and a flat taco dish I can't recall at the moment. The food was decent. Not knock your socks of good, but not bad. A solid 3 star place to grab a decent meal at without breaking the bank.</text>

I had a very well made tasty chimichanga. Too many places these days don't deep fry them. Service was excellent, price good.  The only thing that kept this restaurant from 5 stars was the salsa. They lacked flavor. Mild was mild, spicy was spicy, but very little flavor to them.< /Text>

<review>Pretty standard family Mexican restaurant. Food was decent-- the flautas and quesadilla were good, the Baja Bowl was just okay.

We ordered takeout. Outside of the restaurant is pretty run down (and has a lot of homeless people nearby), but inside is fine.</review></record>

<Review>Food was just mediocre, wait was definitely long like others stated. Came in at 2:00pm on a Sunday. Seated for 30 mins before taking our order and another 30 minutes before the food came out. Most of the other patrons had cleared out by the time our food had arrived. The food was quite plain and and nothing worth mentioning. Maybe it’s because we’re from Southern California where they have good Mexican food.

Not really a good stop on our Oregon/California coast road trip. Maybe that’s what we get for craving Mexican food this far north of the border.< /Review><Rating>1</Rating>< Name>

Crab in the enchiladas is super fishy. Shrimp in the appetizer were overcooked. Too expensive for what it is. Not impressed, which is a bummer, we were looking forward to the meal.</text>

I ordered through DoorDash, which I use at least 3-4 times a week. DoorDash is always great. This place though, they made the driver order me food for me, and sit for 45 minutes while they cooked the food. Normal DoorDash orders everywhere else go straight to the restaurant, the delivery driver goes there and it’s ready for them and it’s delivered to me super fast... the driver waited 45 minutes for them to cook basic Mexican food, I ordered 1 burrito and some tacos - I had to tip the driver $20 because I felt bad for wasting his time. This place needs to shape up and get with the other 50 or so restaurants in Eureka alone that are on DoorDash or get off the service.< /Text>

We got the fajita burritos and they were delicious and humongous! The jalapeno poppers were a great appetizer as well. Highly recommend. And will definelty be returning.

<review>Always dank. A little on the expensive side but they have a ton of items on their menu of real authentic Mexican food, including some delicious seafood dishes you won't find anywhere else in town. My only gripe with them is that ordering online, or through the Yelp app, which they offer as an option, you will NEVER get the correct order or it simply won't be ready. Either call in your order to go, or simply dine in.  An added benefit of dining in (besides the chips, salsa and bean dip) is the people watching entertainment provided free of charge by the tweakers, junkies and scumbags that congregate outside. So grab yourself a window seat and enjoy some delicious Mexican food while you watch the reality TV theater show thats like Maury/Jerry Springer/intervention but with great actors and no reruns.< /review><UserId.>101583785249850129644< /UserId.>< gmapID>

If you see that this place is busy, just walk away and wait for them to become slow again unless you like your food cold and enjoy receiving poor service then be my guest. But dont get me wrong because I really enjoy eating here especially their burritos and tacos.<//text>

<Review>Order via eat24 through PayPal. Drove 15 minutes to pick up. Order wasn’t ready. There were two people in the joint and had already eaten. Mind you it’s only 3:30 in the afternoon. How busy could you be.  All the other local eat24 restaurants were on top of it. These guys dropped the ball. Not even going to bother to review the food. Never coming back to this place again. Also, there are dirty ,drug addicted bums all around this area of town. Gross.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

My favorite place for Mexican food in the area. The carnitas is crispy and the shredded beef are perfectly cooked morsels of tenderness.  The chile relanos are also amazing. Only downside is no hard liquor license but that doesn't stop me from going often.< /Review>

Excellent authentic Mexican food, great selection of menu items, they also have an a la carte menu. I can't believe it took me so long to try this place. It is easily my new favorite place to get Mexican food in Eureka. My former favorite got too big when they started delivering and got rid of their a la carte menu. This place is definitely the best value for your money when it comes to authentic Mexican food. I had tacos al pastor, tacos de asada, and a chile relleno. Everything was delicious. All the meats were tender and juicy. The house salsa had a perfect balance of heat and flavor and they have a green cilantro/lime/avocado sauce that was really good as well. I can't wait to go back and try some of their other items.< /review>

<rating>5< /rating><Text>Went on a Saturday morning and to my surprise they weren't busy at all. (There were three people ahead of me.)  One of the technicians immediately came out and asked what I needed.  Then proceeded to hand me  paperwork that I needed to fill out. About ten minutes later, the technician drive my car in the shop and my car got worked on (smogged.)
I paid $69.95 for a smog check and left in under 30-40 minutes.
I totally recommend this place.  👍<//Text>< Pictures>

<Text>It's your typical Smog Station that does both Gas and Deisel. I brought 3 vehicles to them this year and got a discount on the 3rd one. This is my default Smog station cause it is convenient and close to my residence. They get busy at times but they can usually get it done within 30 minutes.< /Text>< response>

< Review>
I used this location about a month ago and I did write a review. However I accidentally wrote it for another Smog Test place that I was was on my way to that morning. But I stopped at "Smog All 1" because I saw it on the way to the other place. Any way here is my review, I was very satisfied with their service. I was in and out in no more than 15 minutes, after showing up at approx 10:30 am. I have not one bad thing to say. And they were very friendly, I'll definitely be back in the future.</Review>

I just had my floors refinished by Mario with Danville Hardwood.  The floors are absolutely gorgeous!  Mario did a great job of containing the dust during the refinishing, and he was patient with all of my questions, and keeping me involved in the progress.  Everyone I spoke with at the office was friendly and helpful.  Definitely would recommend!</review>

I high recommend Danville Hardwood Co. They met every expectation we had. The crew was punctual and always cheerful. They finished our downstairs floor and stairs in only one and a half weeks but without compromising quality. We love the finished product! One of the rooms we installed the hardwood floors in is now my dance studio allowing me to choreograph and rehearse from home before going on solo tours. The floor can be hard and cold in the non-summer months so if looking to install floors for a yoga or dance studio, I suggest raising the floor. We are on a concrete slab. I give Danville Hardwood Co. a 10/10 both for craftsmanship and customer care!</Text>

There were a few areas that were pet stained and had to be replaced and you cannot tell even if you know where the places were.  The level of craftsmanship was amazing.

They were very helpful in assisting with choosing several potential hardwoods, then letting me bring samples home to let me see what looked good in the Actual setting. Chris, the installer, did an OUTSTANDING job of selecting same-grain adjoining boards; fitting around corners; etc. Highly recommend them for new flooring. Be aware (and flexible) about some scheduling / rescheduling situations that may occur--they are very good, so in high demand...<//text>

Danville Hardwood is the best.  From the estimate to the completion of the work, it was a great experience.  We are so happy with the finished job.  They took our old, 1979 plant floors, filled in the grooves pretty well and then stained a wonderful shade of grey.  We are so pleased with the way they turned out.  The few items we wanted touched up were done within a day of our request.  As to the cost, they were comparable to the other two bids we received.< /review>

<Review>I have remodeled several homes. I was in the market for new hardwood floors. I was lucky and was referred to Danville Hardwood. I met a man named Marc Bush who assisted me with every phase of my project. From our first meeting I knew Marc was a top professional. By first listening to my questions and concerns Marc made me feel like I was important. He helped me with the selection which took quite a long time. Trying to find the perfect product given all the colors and species is a daunting task. It never phased Marc. We discussed installation, including the removal and disposal of my old floors. When the installation crew arrived{ on time I might add} they went straight to work and transformed my home into a work of art. Leaving no detail unturned we even replaced our baseboards. Bottom line my wife is happy, I am happy. If you are looking for old school professionalism, a company who truly puts the customer first, you need to look further. Go see Marc and you will have an experience that will leave you smiling.  Thanks Marc we are very happy we met you.< /Review><gmap_id>0x808f8cad8890ff7f:0x70730ec31eaceb77</gmap_id>< Rate>

The best. Do not hesitate to have your hardwood installed or refinished by Dan at Danville Hardwood. Have used him for the past 20 years. NEVER and issue, never a problem. Beautiful work, perfection. It's rare to find a company that cares about the work they do and makes sure you are happy and satisfied.< /Review>

Danville Hardwood Company refinished our floors a month ago, and we couldn't be happier with the results. The finish and color are perfect, and the house was clean when we returned. The two people who moved the furniture in and out were careful and hardworking, and the office staff was knowledgeable and helpful. We highly recommend Danville Hardwood.< /Review>

Danville Hardwood company met my agent at my home after I'd moved out of the area. The movers had scratched our hardwood floor.

They did their best to buff out the scratch, and then provided me with a really reasonable quote. They arrived on time, and were friendly throughout the process.<//Text>

By far the most professional and experienced in hardwood in this area.  I talked to several companies and went with them and I couldn’t be happier.  They were responsive, easy to get a hold of, extremely detailed and professional.  I had a bit of a time crunch as my due date was fast approaching and they got our floors done in less time than planned and it was a big job.  I highly recommend them, they know what they are doing and they care about their customers.< /review>

They did a beautiful job on refinishing my floor after water damage.  I also had them replace the ugly, filthy carpeted stairs with new hardwood stairs.  What a difference!  They were able to complete the job ahead of schedule, which was very helpful since we had to move out of the house during the job.  I heartily recommend them.</review>

<review>Not all projects go perfectly, and we had a few issues.  I gave 5 stars because the owner of Danville Hardwood Company was in contact with us personally, and went the extra mile to make sure everything got worked out.

Danville Hardware replaced a section of our living room hardwood floor that had been damaged in last season’s rainstorms. They sanded and refinished all the contiguous flooring to a beautiful, like-new finish. They took care of removing and replacing all of our furniture, including engaging an excellent third party piano mover to store our Steinway grand piano. They were friendly, honest and completed the work in a professional and timely fashion. We could not have been happier with their work and would recommend them in a heartbeat.</review>

The hardwood floors in our bedrooms had been covered for years in old wall-to-wall carpet.  We got three bids on tearing it out and refinishing the hardwood underneath.  Dan Yorke wins the prize.  He showed up as promised, on time, and took in the whole situation immediately.  He advised us on what kind of baseboards would look best, gave us a choice of finishes (we chose satin),  what would happen each day and how long it would take.  Two days later we received  his bid, laid out as to what he would do, how it would be done, and carefully itemized.  One of the closets had a cedar floor and we wanted to keep that, so Cesar buffed the cedar floor to restore the cedar smell.  Miguel and his son moved all our furniture as though they were priceless antiques (they aren't). No bumps or scratches on the furniture or the new floors.  By the way, Cesar spoke perfect and fluent English so there were no questions or misunderstandings.  All in all, it was a great experience .  I'd use these guys again in a heartbeat and recommend them to anyone.</Text>

This is a quality business with quality merchandise and excellent customer service.  The staff was very helpful in not only picking out the type of flooring that would be best for us, but the most suitable color for the interior of our home as well.  They made the entire process very easy for us.</Review>

As always, Dan (owner), his team of floor specialists and his office crew came through again. After a remodel, where we added hardwood in another room, from Dan's first estimate visit to the final work, every aspect of getting a new floor and refinishing the other areas to match went without a hitch. Fair prices, excellent customer service, trustworthy and experienced specialists...always first class.</Text>

<review>The Danville Hardwood staff are PROS!!! We decided to refinish our 30+ year old red oak floors which are very hard to work with due to the pinkish color of the raw wood. Rocendo is a true artist! He was able to create a color match to exactly what we wanted and our floors look absolutely beautiful! Dan and Mark are very knowledgeable and provided phenomenal customer service throughout the process. I highly recommend Dan and his staff!!!< /review>< UserId.>

We are very happy with the outcome of our hardwood sanding and refinishing job! We were unsure how thin the floor was and whether the dark color of dirt and water damage in the kitchen would come out and match the rest of the floors again. The team worked very carefully and we now have bright, beautiful floors that look consistent throughout! So pleased!

PS After dealing with a strange issue with our credit card, the Danville Hardwood team worked tirelessly to make it right. THANK YOU!< /text>

Friendly, knowledgeable (over 20 years of experience!), helpful, professional, and all around best in the business employees. Great variety of woods, colors (natural or stained), plank widths and lengths, finishes, a beautiful collection of some of the best brands worth looking at, and all at great prices. Option to install yourself or use them and they're amazing installers. Can't be beat!</text>

Of all the renovations we've done at our home, the refinished flooring was the best decision we've made.  It turned out great thanks to Danville Hardwood and their attention to detail and customer satisfaction.< /text>

<review>The floor is just lovely!  Only one bad experience.  The installers moved a trash can on the side of the house and in doing so damaged a sprinkler head that had to be repaired.  Fortunately, I was able to get it fixed the next day and the fix only cost me $20.00 so no bigger, but felt I needed to let you know.  I am certain it was not intentional but would have been nice to have been told before we had a water issue!</review><pics>None< /pics><resp>None<//resp>< Gmap_id>

<text>Used to be legit Guatemalan baked goods made by a Guatemalan owner for years. I went recently, its changed a little - new ownership, I think.
Now, its run by mexicans, and the bread tastes differently. It crumbles a little like mexican bread too. Nothing wrong with Mexican food if you like that.

But advertise as Guatemalan food or bread, if its not. I don't think I'll be driving 30 miles to go here</text><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

Always a great place for some authentic Guatemalan food. I went for breakfast and had black beans, yucca, and fried plantains. Note, that breakfast (around 7am) only serves what has been made, you cannot order food (think cafeteria style). Has a great space and plenty of room to eat.</Text>

(Translated by Google) Good bread and good breakfasts the bad thing is that now they no longer allow you to eat there but without a doubt a bit of our Guate there.

(Translated by Google) I like it a lot because apart from green bread, they also sell tamales, fresh water, food, natural juices and they also have space and tables to eat there and they are very friendly when it comes to serving you.

(Translated by Google) The bread is good ... and other chapines products ... but what I tried and leaves a lot to be desired and not to buy it again is the supposed corn atol, rather it is boiled water with dough.

(Original)
El pan esta bien..y otros productos chapines...pero lo que probé y deja mucho q desear y no volver a comprarlo es el supuesto atol de elote, más bien es agua hervida con masa.< /review>

<Text>I am very grateful that I came across Erika Roman. She is highly professional and went beyond my expectations. Erika fought for my case and won! She was always very accessible, responsive, reliable, and was an extremely knowledgeable resource on timelines, procedures, current immigration laws and what to expect from the process from start to finish.
I was in fantastic hands and would not hesitate to highly recommend working with her to anyone.
Thank you so much, and keep up the great work!< /Text>< pics>

<Review>I’m so grateful to Erika Roman and all her legal team. They are amazing and very professional. I’ve had the good fortune of being a client of her. I just recently got my Green Card thanks to their help in my case. It was a very smooth and successful process. I highly recommend this law office and for sure I will use this firm again. Great experience.</Review>< pictures>

<Text>I can honestly say that the law Office of Erika Roman is the best Immigration office in California without a doubt. We have been working with Erika for about 8 years (we have a difficult case) and she doesn’t disappoint. She has helped my husband stay in the US, until he qualifies for a pathway to his Green Card. Since the laws have been changing constantly, I am impressed on how professionally her and her staff are, and how they keep us informed every time an opportunity comes available for my husband. I am honored to have her as our lawyer, and I know for sure that with the new administration, she will find the way to help my husband towards his residency (as she already is with DACA). If you need a lawyer, DO NOT hesitate to hire her and her staff to take over your case. They are amazing!!! Thank you Erika and your staff. I will forever be your client and walking advertisement ;).<//Text><Name>Isaura Sanchez<//Name><userid>117758700703208513175<//userid></record>

Thank You  Erika Roman and your team for taking care of my brother's case as your own family, Erika Roman always there to support & respond professionally.
I still remember the first time I discussed with Erika Roman about my brother's case and Erika made me comfortable and listened attentively, my case went so smoothly.
I can’t thank Erika Roman for taking care of my case with excellent outcomes.<//Text>

<review>Erika Roman is the Worlds Greatest Lawyer. She Got my case reduced from a possible felony past a misdemeanor all the way down to an Infraction. I just pay a small fine and I'm done.

Absolute amateur.
Filed my paperwork with my HOME COUNTRY address  instead of my American one.
Disappeared for weeks on end, wouldn't return calls or emails and always had a different excuse.
Was rude and patronizing when I asked for answers. And lastly, after asking for a refund  - threatened me and my wife that she will say to USCIS that are "marriage weren't real". egregiously incompetent.  Shocked she is still allowed to practice law.< /Review>

Best attorney in town. Erika is really good,  her expertise and knowledge of the law make her stand out in her field. I don’t hesitate to recommend her to anybody because I know that she can win any case or at least  be honest and discuss your options. Thank you Erika for fighting  for my family.< /review>

She is an amazing attorney, if I were to get into details it would be a lot to say about my husbands case. But I can tell you this he was considered a flight risk and had another charge as well, he was denied bond the first time with the worst attorney. And 6 months later I found Erika Roman, I did a lot of research and I was convinced when I seen she’s been on tv and in a magazine where the people she’s helped come out with her saying she’s helped them. She sure is the queen of bonds, if you are looking for an attorney please please please give her a call I promise you, you will not regret it. My husband had a hard case and today she was able to get him out on bond! My husband said she was amazing during the hearing and she even called me saying she got the bond for him, she called to see how I was doing, texted me to see if I was able to pay the bond and offered more help and advice! Erika you are my angel and I feel so blessed to be able to find you, I was scared to have my husband deported or kept in detention, but after six harsh months you are able to bring him home to me and my 3 kids that miss him very much! Please hire her people it would be the best decision you ever make! My husband should be released tomorrow 8/16< /text>

Estoy muy contento en la forma que la abogada Erika está llevando mi caso. Siempre es profesional y me tiene al día en lo que está pasando en mi caso. Todos en su oficina son muy profesionales y me da gusto que todos hablan español y es más fácil para poder comunicarme con ella. Yo recomiendo a la abogada Erika a toda la gente que necesite ayuda con problemas de inmigración.<//Review>

Maybe a quality of Round Table or something like that. They are pretty good. It is more of a stuffed pizza type as they put the ingredients inside and the. The cheese over it. Or maybe that was just the Hawaiian pizza I got. Either way if anyone remembers the old Godfathers Pizza chain this pizza is a lot like that.  Will come back again.<//text>< Pictures>

<text>I ordered a deep dish pizza and got a thick crust instead. If this is suppose to be a deep dish, it sure ain't. Cheese on top, little sauce. This ain't no deep dish!! + I ordered wings, well done and they just served the wings as is.

The Fresh Brothers in Redondo Beach better than this one. 👌👍<//text>< GmapID>

Ordered with a fair amount of time left before they closed and I was told it would take an hour to arrive. Apparently they outsourced the  delivery to door dash and didn’t include the full address so the driver left with my order and now the store is closed. Last time I’m ordering from Fresh Brothers. Horrible experience.</review>

I had high hopes for their Chicago Deep Dish Pizza. My first clue that something wasn’t right was when pickup was available after 30 minutes. Anyone from Chicago knows it should be AT LEAST 45 minutes in the oven. This pizza was basically pan pizza with two layers of sauce/pepperoni. Nothing Chicago about it. The double pepperoni left it very salty to taste. This might be a good place for your normal pizza, but Chicago friends steer clear.< /review>

<Review>I'm sorry, but....

For any given pizza, crust can be good, toppings can be good, cheese is cheese .. but the SAUCE. The sauce is what makes one pizza stand out from all the others.

We fell in love with Fresh Brothers when they appeared in the South Bay in the early 2000s. For every birthday party, and many other times as well, we'd buy a few Fresh Brothers pies and they were wonderful.

But lately the sauce has just gone downhill.

I had a thin crust pizza tonight with chicken sausage and mushroom. The crust and toppings were good, the cheese was fine, but the sauce was bland and boring. Utterly uninspiring. The previous time I ordered a pie, there was hardly any sauce on it at all! This time, it was just flavorless.

What happened, Fresh Brothers? Did you cut corners? Choose a cheaper recipe?  It makes me sad, because for many years Fresh Brothers was THE PIZZA, hands down. It beat everything in town and all around. My daughter says" they're just not good any more," and I have to reluctantly agree.

Fresh Brothers used to beee our all time family favorite. Now, meh.<//Review><Response>None</Response>< Gmap_id>

Normally I would say that I absolutely LOVE Fresh Brothers Pizza! But this time, and perhaps it was just me, the pizza didn't live up to my expectations. They have changed the app slightly and now they charge more for a little extra sauce. I had never ordered more sauce  but this last order lacked sauce. The new era of "everything is in an app" with no access to human beings leads this reviewer left to leaving a review instead of having a conversation with a human being who could possibly make a difference. So, this is how it has to be I guess. The pizza was very dry and since their sauce is normally "to die for" and in this instance the sauce was insufficient (which since it was "take out" I didn't realize until I got home, which is 30 miles away...) i was left extremely disappointed and wondering if this is what FRESH BROTHERS pizza is now all about. I will try again, and i hope my results are better. I will also call prior to picking up my pizza and tell them my last experience. I hope they will make some amends.< /Review>

This isn't a sit down and eat place really.   They do have a few tables.  Not many choices for drinks as well.   But the pizza was yummy.  We ordered a large thin the Millers special which is a meats lover pizza. Lots and lots of toppings! Will order delivery next time.<//Review>

Quite possibly the best vegan pizza I have ever had. The Daiya cheese was fully melted and the choice of vegan sausage was delicious. They're vegan crust was also very well done, also I absolutely respect the fact that they offer the option for people with dietary restrictions.

I'm not vegan in any sense of the word. I love my red meat, dark meat, white meat, you name it. But I am lactose intolerant, so I was incredibly excited to have an option that wouldn't make me sick.

The only thing that I think could be improved is the presentation of the pizza, it definitely looked rather odd.<//review>

<rate>5< /rate><text>We used to order from our local Fresh Brothers in Marina Del Rey.  After a change in staff, we had back to back horrific experiences with that location.  My family, not happy with my boycott of Fresh Brothers, prompted me to call the Manhattan Beach location to just pick up pizza from them.  After speaking with the manager and letting her know why we didn't want to order from the Marina, she offered to deliver to our house anyways, to make up for the bad experience.  This was several months ago.  The good vibes didn't end there.  During this time, she has done a myriad of small things to make up for the bad experience (unexpected but very nice) and of course, the pizza is awesome.  Great service, great pizza and even delicious salads too!<//text></record>

An hour and a half for pizza to be delivered.  For the price, you would think your pizza should be hot, or they hire enough employees to deliver your pizza hot.  The timely manner also did not help our croutons, they were soggy by the time we got our dinner delivered.< /review>

<text>Fresh Brothers has the right ingredients, but it isn't always on point with delivering the flavour. This location is really a take-out location more than a restaurant, but there are some seats to eat there. The pizza ranges from ok to good, but I've never had any luck with the wings - somehow they seem to not quite have the flavour they should.

On a business branding note - Fresh Brother delivery drivers are constantly zooming around Manhattan Beach, blowing through stop signs and driving erratically. The poor driving is a known to many Manhattan Beach residents, and doesn't put this location of Fresh Brothers in the best light.<//text>< pictures>

Had The Miller Special. Honestly it was a m a z i n g. More importantly, my dad loved it. He worked at a pizzeria for years and has been working at a high-end bakery for over 30 years. The fact that he enjoyed it and my family meant a great deal to me.

Additionally, the staff at the Manhatten Beach location were super friendly and approachable. Even tho I should up 10 minutes earlier than the time I was told it was gonna be ready they did a great job of expediting my order.

Thanks a lot !

<Review>The pizza here is definitely better than Papa John's, Pizza Hut, and Little Caesars. I would say grimaldi's pizza is 10 times better but they don't deliver. This is the reason why I call fresh brothers.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

Good house tea.. just doesn't make sense that they would open so late in the day.. people drink coffee and tea first thing in the morning to get the day started and these guys open up at 11am like geniuses</Text>

Good place to play boards games and have a drink. I would not recommend this location of Ding Tea to families or ones with children as the music played was offensive and had cursing.</Text>

My favorite boba shop in this area! The boba tastes amazing and they have the best milk tea! I also tried the monster bobo latte since it was their most popular drink. It was a little too sweet for me but you can adjust the sugar level so I'd probably go half sweet next time. Staff is very nice and helpful and the decor inside is so cute! Definitely a bigger boba shop than most boba shops around. Lots of seating to study or hang with friends. Highly recommend :)<//Review>

<Review>The Ding Tea empire has finally conquered Fullerton in the form of the totally original name, Ding Tea Fullerton. Lets start by saying that I was a big fan of the decorations of the store that they took over and the fact that they pretty much kept most of it is a big plus.They also brought in a really large flower wall with the words Ding Tea Fullerton on it which is really pretty and aesthetically pleasing.

I came here once after seeing on my FiveStar app that I received a  BOGO Free coupon, and because my experiences at other Ding Teas has always been positive, I thought I would just give this new Ding Tea location a try. The experience here was the same, great drinks, and a fun environment to be around while waiting for my drink. The service when I came here though was okay. There was some sense of attitude and the utter desire of dissatisfaction but I blew it off. This was why I had to dock one star,

I would see myself studying here because, well, I used to study alot at the Miss 6 Tea that this Ding Tea took over, so why not just continue to study here again,< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None</Resp><gmapID>0x80dcd5938b19dbaf:0xe2d0ea042b34b411</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

This is by far the best liquor/convenient stores I've ever been to.  This is my regular place to shop wether I need groceries for dinner, or on the go medicine or a quick snack or drink!  You'll find the best selection of liquor at unbeatable prices! The customer service here is tremendous Ray is a honest trustworthy man along with his workers.  Any questions Ray is there to help always a big smile n positive attitude.  After a long day at work when I go to get a cold beer to relax Rays always there to whip up a quick conversation to brighten up my mood reassuring me that there are good whole hearted people in this world 10/10 would recommend this store to anyone in the area and even outside of San Diego!!</review>

Never have I been to a store that had so many employees on the floor that were so unhelpful to me. I went to this store looking for what I thought would be a relatively common item (brackets for mounting a windowbox planter on a railing). Upon walking in, I tried to talk to an employee to find out where this item would be, and despite seeing multiple employees nearby the entrance, they all seemed to be actively walking away from me, uninterested in helping. When I finally cornered some employees (who still seemed like they didn't want to be interacting with me), I was pointed to the same wrong aisle on the complete wrong end of the store several times. It was only when I went to the garden section that a (reluctant) employee pointed me to the correct section.

Even in the appropriate section, though, options were scarce. Despite having dozens of planter boxes in stock, the only appropriate mounting brackets I could find had obviously been returned (one was disorganized in its packaging and was missing parts, and the other was literally in a gallon plastic bag) and were not labeled at all.

So in the end, I did get what I was looking for, but the store and its employees felt hostile to me at every turn. I don't normally complain about employee service because I recognize that people don't have to treat me like their master, but when several employees avoid to me and give me incorrect information and the product is shoddy and disorganized, I feel like I deserve to complain. I will likely not return to this store if I can help it<//text>

This has been our one stop place for all our home renovation projects and backyard furnitures. We remodeled our home and during the period visited this store more than 50-60 times to look at different materials and compare its price with other store.
They carry quality stuff. Their gardening equipment and plants are very good too.< /text>

< Review>
Interacted with 3 employees who all seemed to be attentive to my queries.  Unfortunately I wasn’t able to find the 1 item I went there for so I settled for something that I’m not sure if I’ll be happy with.  I don’t really like being my own cashier when I go shopping, but their “self checkout” stations were the only choices I had.</Review>

But, no more cashier only self pay. If that's for you, great! So, the line was down the aisle 14 deep. My wife is handicapped and stand in line to self pay? We went to customer service/returns.

I buy my water at Lowes. Plus if I need other items I will find most of them here. The staff recognize me which is a positive. And the costs are reasonable.<//text>

Haven't been to Lowe's physically for a number of months given what's going on. But I needed stuff like bark and plants. So I went this afternoon. I was only able to get two bags of the plastic bark I wanted both tipped in spots and partly missing stuff. I mentioned this to the cashier: he shrugged. I also got a bag of organic cactus soil and I know it was full and closed when I put it in the shopping cart but when I got out to the car, it had popped open and partly over everything. No one offered to help me take anything out. I was leaving on the cart and already out of breath since I use a disabled spot a parking lot. I also dropped a very small little battery package on the ground right next to one of the Loew's staff who was doing something on a tablet or phone, and I had to lean down and get it while I was carrying two plants: she did not offer to help at all. The cashier assumed I wanted a paper receipt without even giving me a chance to press the button to say I wanted email. All in all it was less than satisfying experience compared to a year ago plus, when it was one of my favorite spots<//Text>

Lowe's will always be one of my all-time favorite stores! I don't think there's much they can do that would make me not want to go there. They are always very well kept across the board.<//Text>

Enrique from Lumber and Robert Amaro from drills(?) were very helpful when I needed a leg made for my couch, they helped me fashion one that would do the job! Very pleased with their customer service and kindness. Didn't hurt that they were super cute too ;)< /review>

Ordered a washing machine in store. They can’t seem to deliver - 20 days out now after continually revising their availability! Still haven’t confirmed delivery - can’t recommend them. Trying to call them back today and nobody answering phones - negative two stars now if I could - easier using the local laundromat than dealing w Lowe’s right now 🤷🏼‍♂️</Text>

Worst customer service you can imagine. I placed and paid for an in-store order. A month later, a Lowes associate called me and told me the order was canceled. I asked to have a similar product instead of just receiving the refund. Never got a call back from a Lowes associate. Now I am currently trying to call the store back for a full refund but nobody will answer the phone. After ringing for a while and hearing the same recording, the phone hangs up. After I hopefully get my refund, I will never shop at Lowes again.<//Text>

<Text>Lowe's store San Jose Ridder Park.
Margaret brought out my curbside pickup she called me as soon as I got to the driveway and was at spot number 6 before I could turn the car off. This is so much better than last time restored my faith in Lowe's. Last time 45 minute wait and wrong item congratulations to excellent employee Margaret</Text>< Name>

Wow! What an service!
Usually I don't have any preference for visiting Lowes or Home depot, but the recently experience I had with one of the associate here made me think about it.
Unlike other stores where we need to find the associate if we need an help, this guy came to me and ask if he can help me and even after helping me find the product, he was willing to wait and help me with other products too.

For one of the product which we were finding it difficult to locate, he pointed me towards another associate who had more expertise in that specific product, yet he didn't stop searching, he went out of his way to look for product while another associate was helping.

From now on, this store will definitely be my first choice over the another one.</Review>

<Rating>1<//Rating><text>Tries to get some electrical wires that my local store does not have stock for. Went two times, both time wait for the electrical guy to show up to help me cut the wire.

First time I waited for 20 min and someone finally told me the electrical associate had left for the day already.

Second time waited for 50 min. No one show up. They did broadcast 3 times.. but it is just me staring at the wire I want to get, with no associates to operate the wire cutting machine.

Will never go back to this store.<//text><pics>None< /pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

Not the best experience. They are very understaffed.
Placed the order online on Saturday. Only got a confirmation email on Monday. Using the app, indicated that I was on my way for pickup. Got to the store and confirmed my curbside pickup parking spot using the app and waited. Nothing. Tried calling and the phone continued ringing without an answer for more than a minute. Called again and just held on. Finally got through and was put on hold  10 more min and got to talk to someone. Finally got my items after about 45 min of waiting in the parking lot.< /Text>

For some reason, I never thought I would step foot inside Lowe's. I'm guessing it could be a subconscious thing because the name sounds so down, and their blue themed color doesn't help. Feels like a downer store. Well, that all changed when I stepped foot inside. It actually feels like a high end, clean, professional Home Depot. Everything is always clean, and I seem to find better quality items here. Now when I have to go to Home Depot, I feel cheap, poor, and down. That bright orange color doesn't revitalize me like before.< /review>

<Text>Can't express my gratitude more for this store, so here I am writing a review. Lost my valuable notebook by leaving in a cart in the parking lot. Four hours later, I noticed it missing and called the store to ask about. They took my info and called me shortly afterward confirming they actually found it. Extremely relieved and I really want to thank all the staff in helping me locate this important item of mine. Unfortunately I cannot expect excellent service like from any other big hardware store. Lowes however, and this location in particular, stand out. Keep up the great work. Thanks again!< /Text>< rating>

<review>Lowe's always seem to have what I need. The people there are pretty helpful as well which is a big plus especially when doing DIY home maintenance. With the holiday season I found the store very crowded. Lucky for me I could find what needed quickly. The only issue this day was the long line at checkout. There were at least 15 people ahead of me. Surprisingly the line went smoothly and did not take as long as I feared.<//review><Date>1606602346597</Date>< resp>

Ordered a refrigerator and it was delivered damaged.  They had me re-order and charge my card again stating that once I provide a new order number it will be credited.  Have had to spend 1-2 hours dealing with this issue and no attempt to make things right on the part of Lowes.</review>

This store is really, really messy. I have no idea if it’s a permanent condition or if they are rearranging everything, but what a mess!

Even the aisle/bay numbers on the website do not match the item location in store... fortunately an associate was able to direct me to the product I was looking for... which was stored high in the air.

So much for monitoring the shelves...

Not impressed by this location. Sunnyvale location feels much neater< /Review>

<text>Tried to rent a truck here to take home two vanities but the only one available had a check engine light on so the guy at customer service tells us to go to Sunnyvale (15 mins away). We asked him to call and hold it, he said he couldn’t because there was only one but he verified it was there and told us to hurry over there. We get to Sunnyvale and they said they’ve never had trucks at their store. How frustrating!! That’s one clear way home depot beats out Lowes. We were planning to buy $1500 of items items at least, plus this truck fiasco, and they still were going to charge $80 for delivery which is ridiculous. The least they could’ve done was waived the delivery fee.</text></record></dataset><record>

This was one of the worst online curbside pickup experiences. My item never arrived, and the store never picked up the phone. This was a great place to shop until their CEO screwed it up with all the cost-cutting. I'll stick with Home Depot and Ace Hardware. Ace has stepped up their game lately with an updated app and good customer service.< /text>

<Pics>None< /Pics><Text>I've had rhe most horrible customer service in this store. It seems like no one wanta to take charge and try to figure out your issue with the orders placed for pick up. I been trying to pivk up my AC unit that i ordered 11 days ago and the website says the order has been reveat this stored but no one cant find it. My husband went to the storr to fijnd out whats happening and they told him it was in the back but could not located. They kept telling him to wait and wait and after and hour they told him to leave his phone number and they would call him with information but its been two dats and nothing. I been trying to get a hold of someone in the store but its impossible no one answers. I tried again tgis morning and finally someone answered and told me my ordered was waiting for me in Burbank but my confirmation for my oeder says is ready in San Jose. The gentleman asked me if i wanted to cancel my order and i could not believe that was his first suggestion to fix my problem. I told him i been waiting for tgis unit dealing with this extreme heat all days and i did not wanted to cancel because i really needed it. He had no solution for me so he said he would transfer me amd then hung up on me. I never leave reviews but i xan nor pass it this time. I have a montg baby and i feel so horrible when he gets so fussy because of this heat, the even got a little geat rash and I'm so upset no one at the store cant help me. Is just horrible customer service.<//Text><Rating>1</Rating>< Resp>

I’m giving this review 5 stars for the one person Jesus Sanchez who went above and beyond to assist me when no one else would. It took three calls for me to get someone to call me back.  Jesus was the only one who called me back and took the time to answer my questions.  Way to go Jesus, you know the true meaning of the word customer service.  Thank you!</review>

They do not take Samsung or Apple pay. The 21rst Century is calling Lowes. Move forward or get left behind.
Also a lot of the items were in the wrong bays. Guess it's hard to find competent help.</text>

<review>Absolutely horrible. Worst Lowe's ever visited. Many employees are not wearing their vests. Cannon tell who is working there. Inattentive. Lots of employees but horrible service. Lowe's corporate must send an inspection.
Waited endlessly for someone to retrieve a microwave I bought... The same employees who were taking their sweet time before were super happy to void my purchase. It seems to me that they were happy about "less to do" if I did not go through with the purchase. Unbelievable!</review>< UserId.>

Ordered something with an ETA to the Dec 7. It's now Dec 17th and cannot get accurate information online. Went to store and they cannot get any info either except it is at the distribution partner so it's in a black hole. Bad customer service. Every one pointing fingers at other parts of company</Text>

I have always enjoyed shopping at Lowe’s. However, one should not make major purchase for appliance during the pandemic. This store takes the money, but does not deliver as promised. No one answers the phone as instructed, and the folks at the store don’t know anything and promise someone will call. Twice, the delivery company was a no show. They said Lowe’s cancelled the delivery.  The store is just understaffed, basically, management issue. Best Buy is a better choice. I would not buy any appliances from them ever again and I am returning the product I purchased because it was not delivered as promised.</Text>

I hear some of the negative reviews and understand people’s frustration, wanting to give two stars myself sometimes.
Let me tell you this time I came here to get some concrete bags with my wife and had a better experience. I was moving slow loading the 60 lb bags due to bicep tendon surgery nearly 5 months ago, when Terri at the pro desk shouted out if I needed help. I only had one bag left and my pride, so I politely declined the offer. Soon we went to check out and again she noticed my struggle and offered to pull up and have someone load it. My wife Karen said yes to my relief. I went to get our suv and when I pulled up an employee was waiting for me and loaded up. I think his name was Constantino, not 100% sure.

It’s been hard for me to admit some weakness and ask for help with things I normally do myself. It was nice to deal with helpful, non-robotic employees for once and I was happy and satisfied overall.<//Text>

The customer service Sofia and Salina are both rude. The order was delayed. As customer service, they couldn't provide the ETA for the order and also hang up my calls. It was ridiculous. i can't believe they talk to a customer in such a rude attitude. are you sure you're hiring such a customer service?<//Text>

Store seems to be grossly understaffed, especially in the pickup and returns department. Purchased 3 in stock items online to be able to pick them up immediately. Was told to wait until receiving a confirmation for pickup. Waited 24 hours and could not reach anyone on the phone. Drove by the store and called the pickup number listed in the parking lot, again no answer. Waited in line for 30 minutes to be told that the items had not yet been pulled. Picked them up myself (1 item was no longer in stock) and waited another 30 minutes in line to be allowed to leave the store with the previously bought items. Called customer service but was immediately hung up on after listening to a recorded message saying that the office was closed by the time I called at 6pm.<//review>

I only come here because it has parking and is not busy (The Home Depot had a 1 hour plus line, no line here). When they first opened Lowe's in the Bay area they were nice and organized, now they're really just disorganized dumps. If the website shows something in stock, it's a coin flip if they actually have it. They seem to list a lot of things as being in the last bay of an aisle on their web page. Claim it's in stock. When the bay doesn't exist or has nothing to do with the product you are looking for. I've asked the sales associates and it's not just that they're not knowledgeable about the location of the item, it's that they don't care. I give it three stars because Lowe's itself has some quality, useful, and unique products if you can actually get them at this location. I really wish they would just shut down Bay operations and some other hardware franchise would move into the Bay area.</Text>

<Review>I have been waiting for my delivery for ages; there was a mix up with my address, the delivery company couldn’t fix so they transferred me back to store; nobody picked up the phone, I had to drive there in person to change the address. A one time thing is fine, mistakes can happen, but I believe this is the the third time or maybe even the fourth time. I just don’t understand how the logistic company can get a simple change in address wrong. I used to love Lowe’s,  but this mix up is just not acceptable. I will never ever buy from Lowe’s again.

Very bad very bad. They told us some of the products would be 75 % off on a cart, hearing this we put all the wood we needed onto our cart, which was super hard to do since it was really heavy and big wood. After all our hard work, we went to check out and they told us we only had 25% off. We spoke to the manager, told him what the situation was, the manger just laughed at us and did not believe what we where saying. If it was 25% off we would not have put all that cracked wood onto our cart. No one believed us and all the employees laughed at us. We where so mad, wasted so much time. I don’t get why they lie to us, not just that, all those big employees coming at us together it was a really a scary experience.< /Text>

<user>102682238132714626896</user><text>1. Online order took 3 days for being ready.
2. On 2nd day, Customer service personnel indicated order was ready for pick up. But when I got to the curbside pick up, the store indicated that it was not ready.
3. Finally got an email on 3rd day that order was ready for pick up.
4. Nobody answers curbside telephone. I go in and I get informed that the order is ready for pick up at a different location!
5. They checked inventory at the store where I ordered from, and they had all the items. They went ahead and canceled the order and  billed me the new order.
6. I spent lot of time ordering online, one unsuccessful pick up trip and the wait time at the store. A total waste of time!!
7. Fix it Lowes or don't offer curbside!!!<//text>< name>

<review>SO DISAPPOINTING. I have always loved shopping at Lowes, until now. It might just be that this location was a bad seed, but I know I will never go there again. I Ordered a $300+ griddle online, and it came with free assembly (thank fully i screen shot it). when I got the email my order was ready to pick up waited in line to be helped by a upset customer service representative named Brandy. She was mad at all the customers before we even got to the service desk, she processes the order we wait another 15 min, for her to bring the griddle up in a box. I explain to her we had free assembly on this and she looked it up in the computer and said well it doesn't say that on my end. Wheil this is going on some coworkers were going out the door and she was more interested in making plans to drink with one of them then helping finish our transaction. I was in awe. I finally asked for the manager, he said he was gonna check the floor for an assembled unit, i knew there easnt one. I had to special order this griddle because they didn't have 1 there, no one took anytime to listen. I had to show the screenshot of the free assembly on my phone for them to believe me. WHAT A JOKE. then I was told ^We can add you to the assembly list^ Totally not cool. In total we were there over an hour and left without the griddle😪 There were 2 people who helped us, gigi was the lady who got us our griddle the next day, she was there both days and saw what we went through. And the guy who stepped up and said "ill assemble it tonight, sorry this happened."
OVERALL I DO NOT RECCOMED THIS LOCATION.< /review></record>

<pictures>None<//pictures><Review>I wish I could give 0 rating to this San Jose store. I am struggling in tracking our order which was placed online for store pickup.
Online status shows that order is ready for pickup and we have been going to store regularly and nobody can find it. Staff is very incompetent and doesn’t care at all for the customer. Everytime we talk to a different person which claims himself as store manager and eventually they all say that we’ll check and give you a call.....but haven’t received neither our order nor the call....online customer care is saying it’s ready for pickup at this location and store pickup is saying that online portal don’t have any access to local store status. So basically online status is bogus.
I don’t know how do they operate....
Still waiting for my order or any relevant status update!!!
Experience with this store has been very disappointing and frustrating!!! very poor staff and customer support sucks specially so called store managers!< /Review>< Date>

I echo another reviewer about appliance delivery.

I purchased a fridge with delivery and haul-away service. The delivery company didn't send enough people to get the fridge to 2nd floor. I called the store multiple times to reschedule (because the delivery company cannot reschedule by themselves), and couldn't reach the single person responsible for delivery. I ended up driving to the store and asking in person, making sure to reschedule the delivery and making a note about sending enough people to do the job. 2 weeks later the delivery company called on the day of delivery, and guess what, they still didn't send enough people. I couldn't believe how broken their communication process is. I've had enough and immediately canceled the order.

Never purchasing appliances from Lowes again.<//Text>

Avoid their online order. I ordered one on 7/17/2020, with delivery date to be 7/23/2020. It never delivered to my home. Lowe's even do not have an on line customer service phone number. The only thing you can do is call the store. I called multiple times, cannot went through to a real person. Terrible experience..</review>

<text>Super helpful in store. Delivery of washer/dryer scheduled two weeks out. Night before voicemail said "no inventory for washer" - unable to get in touch with Lowe's. Each time you call you get disconnected / no one will answer. Reading the reviews now I wish I would have bought elsewhere. No management oversight / no inventory management / not competent. Buyer beware & do not buy appliances here unless you can transport and install them yourself.<//text><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None< /response><GmapID>0x808fcc098cc77683:0x7d8284a3f988ca14< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

A place to get things quick. I've picked up tools, a solar lamp with proximity sensor, some thread locker and even a box of M8-25 bolts here for my bike rack. Don't expect to find help quickly if you are lost in the isles, the customer service is definitely subpar. Other than that, I'm grateful they are there when most other places are shut down - especially at a time when fixing things up around the house seems the only worthy endeavor.<//Review>

<review>This is a tough review.  The visit started wit the return of a $1.22 item purchased the day before.  That experience was awful, deserving less than 1 star.  The visit ended with the purchase of 500 Square feet of a really nice laminate and the service received on that transaction was 5 stars.  Thus the 3 star rating overall.

The issue at the returns area was a total lack of concern on anyone's part about wasting customer's time.  When I arrived, there were 6 people ahead of me and a few in the pickup line with one person serving both lines!  6 or more associates strolled thru the area with no attempt to get more help assigned.  One of the associates seemed to be a manager as she showed up 5 minutes after being paged by the one guy tending to the two lines and then stuck around to finally get the lines moving.  Total time of my life I will never get back, 20+ minutes!<//review>< username>

We were in such a big line that took almost an hour in line there. In such times they should hire more employees to support them which would be a win win situation.</review>< Pics>

<Review>This is a nice clean Lowes, but lacking in customer service in the paint department.  Getting paint mixed here will take you an extremely long time.  Hit the Help button as soon as you walk in, that way it will only be a 15 to 20 minute wait after you're finished getting everything you need.</Review><name>Rodney Williams< /name></record>

Called to have my order to be dropped off to me at curbside pick up. The lady on the phone was completely rude and kept cutting me off. She explained she was short staffed and can't control call outs. I tried asking how long it would take for them to grab my order when I came in. She was very aggressive and said she couldn't tell me. Canceling my order and NEVER shopping here. I work in retail and understand when we are short staffed. Why offer a severice you cannot perform, and be rude on top of that? I should have just ordered this item on Amazon and got it shipped for free. What a hassle.< /text>

Do not do curbside pickup at the store, they will not answer the phone and you will spend 20 minutes trying to call with no success. In all honesty, you are better off going into the store and getting the item(s) yourself.</review>

I am sure this store is great in inventory and helping in store customers. but I have an in-store pickup item which I mistakenly had it sent it to this store and wanted to call to correct the mistake. Called them maybe 20+ times with not a single time being picked up. The last time, someone directly put me on hold (music channel) and kept me waiting for 1 hour and 20minutes till the store close time!!!! if the store doesn't mean to pick up any call from any customer, why not just cut the phone line and skip the trouble publishing store phone number on your website?<//Review>

I tried to pick up my online order. Got an email it was ready to go. Park and call as instructed no answer for a few minutes. So I go inside and the pickup lane was closed. Not only were the rude about that I then had to wait in the most inefficient line. For thirty minutes!! DO NOT USE PICKUP. Just go into the store and find it yourself. Save your time.<//text>

<Text>I placed an order for curbside pickup about a month ago. It stated the order was ready, so I went to the store and called the curbside pickup line. It took well over 5 minutes for them to actually pick up the phone, when they did, she said she had the items for me and acted put out that I asked for it to be brought to my car since it was curbside pickup. It took another 15 minutes for it to be brought out. Apparently, I didn’t receive all my items and although I wasn’t charged that day for them, I was charged a month later and it stated that I had picked them up, even though I was working all day. I tried calling to resolve the issue and spent over 10 minutes trying to get ahold of someone and no one answered. A lady called me to ask me about my experience and I gave her my honest, respectful answer and all she said was they were short staffed. I’m very disappointed in this Lowe’s.< /Text>< pics>

Don’t bother with curbside pickup here... we tried following instructions and after 10 minutes of nonstop ringing, no one answered the phone! Ended up going inside and there were 10+ people in line! We left without our order, and plan to cancel it. The whole point of curbside pickup is so people can avoid going into a busy store... Don’t offer a service if you can’t provide it!!<//Text>

There are literally 28 people waiting in the return line right now and the second customer is being served in the last 30 min I've been here. There is something terribly wrong with either the staffing or their customer service protocol to allow their customers to wait this long.

Update: I asked an associate what the hold up was and he said they have a regular customer who often comes in irate and probably drunk who throws a wrench in to things. I'll add one star for that since it's not entirely their fault. They should still have two return registers going.</text>

This is a nice clean Lowes, but lacking in customer service in the paint department.  Getting paint mixed here will take you an extremely long time.  Hit the Help button as soon as you walk in, that way it will only be a 15 to 20 minute wait after you're finished getting everything you need.<//text>

< Review>
I ordered online, but never received order ready email. I went there and found the closet door in stock, bright then to the cashier and waited on line for about 20 minutes. The cashier informed me to go to customer service. I waited another 45 minute in customer service line. The employees are all standing around and we're obviously doing anything to avoid providing customer service. No help offered at any point during the entire visit. Stuck there because I had already paid.<//Review>

This one has to be the worst Lowe's.  The customer service is non existent.   All the customer service personals need to start their basic training on how to talk to customer.  If the things u want is available somewhere else, it is highly recommended to get it somewhere else.   Avoid this place at all cost!</text>

<Text>Poor management at this location. Waited 20 minutes for a propane exchange. Lady working the register was helpful tracking down an employee after I was waiting for a while. Save yourself the time and get your tanks refilled at uhaul for a fraction of the price. Only reason I came here was because my tank was expired and they'll normally exchange it without hassle.< /Text>< GmapID>

Go to another store.
I don’t understand why so many employees are not wearing masks. It’s not serious here at all.
The guy at the entrance wanders aimlessly. If you want to spray your cart, there is a bottle of pink soap, with a single dirty towel. Customers are allowed in without masks despite the sign starting otherwise.

Go to another store!!!!<//Text>

<Review>While this is a very typical Lowe's, it's very hit and miss when it comes to service. Some days, I get amazing service - particularly in the Garden area and Lumber, but when it comes to Paint or picking up online order, it's been really awful lately.

One morning, a customer and myself waited 30 minutes for someone to come to the Paint department, and I cannot even tell you how how many employees walked right on by without a care that people were waiting.

In regards to online ordering, we use the service so it can expedite the process of getting what we need after a long day of work. So when you end up waiting longer than it would have taken to go get the items yourself, it doesn't make much sense. This Lowe's needs to figure out how to do the process better because Sunnyvale Lowe's is very quick and organized in comparison.

Some days it's 5 stars, other times it's 1 star - good luck!< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

<username>Ashish Kapania</username><Time>1580158773882</Time><rating>1</rating><text>This review is about the appliance department at this Lowes. We decided to buy appliances (refrigerator, washer and dryer) for our new home from here due to its proximity to our house. After 7 failed attempts to deliver the appliance we gave up and canceled the order. Delivery issues varied from the delivery team refusing to take the appliances to the 3rd floor (they need 4 people to deliver to 3rd floor but only 2 people would show up), wrong parts for installation to the units being damaged.

The delivery department at Lowe’s kept making false promise each time and messing up our delivery. I finally decided to cancel when the assistant store manager stepped in and could not guarantee a timely delivery.</text>< pictures>

Convenient to park. Who can beat that in the expensive metropolitan neighborhood? Impressive that plenty of knowledgeable staffs who provides genuine comments on your goal of coming to store.  Impressive again.</Review>

My work exclusively comes to this Lowes over the closer Home Depot. Their website does a better job at locating parts in stock. The staff is helpful and not condescending. Would reccomend to anyone< /Text>

Went to pick up my part at curbside, no booth. Walked inside to service podium, saw about twenty people lined up for returns. Asked agent that I came to pick up my part at curbside and was told to get in the line. Left the store and drive home.< /Text>

This location of Lowe's is a little hidden, but they have been worth the search for me. The employees actually know what you are talking about when you are searching for the one thingamajig that you don't know the name of, just the description of what it does and where it goes.< /Review>

I did not find the people staffed at Pro desk are motivated to do their job. Checkout is the slowest here - even though more than one employees are there only one person checks out. The attitude is super rude - especially the woman.< /review>

<Text>Easily found what we needed, and were able to recycle light bulbs. A total win. The only negative aspect of this shopping trip was an employee told us they didn't recycle small florescent bulbs. We walked around until we found the recycle bin.

Lowes is easy to navigate this store.  My favorite is the garden department.  We also had plenty of choices for a portable air conditioners.  The staff is friendly and helpful if you can get their attention.<//Review>

This place sucks. I paid for a deep freezer. Prior to purchase I asked if I can leave with it that day. They said yes. I wait 20 minutes to find out they had 12 bbq grills in the way. All the employees were just standing around. Doing nothing.</review>

I would give this store 5 star if they have good customer services.  This place is nice, clean and well organize.  They have most of the household items here, bit more expensive than Home depot, because it seem they have higher qualities and make in usa.   This store would be perfect if they got more customer services nearby so we could ask for help or may need to have button ask for help like home depot.  Most of their employers somehow rather at the register, maybe for fun than work.  Also, exchange dept seem unhappy when seeing customer return.  I have to give this store 2 star and hope they improve next time i am visiting.<//review>

Home Depot is dark and gloomy. 2) It's  clean and neat. Home Depot may actually be too, but the oranges and browns combined with the low light makes it look disheveled. 3) Blue and White vs. Orange and Brown.< /review><response>None< /response>< Date>

<text>I would give negative points if I can.

What a super poor and unsatisfied experience with Lowe's at 775 Ridder Park Dr, San Jose, CA 95131.

I have an ordered with Lowe's about interior door installation back on Oct, 2018.

The first step is measurement, but the contractor that Lowe's hired to do the measurement never shows up on the scheduled date and Lowe's never communicate with me in advance until I call them multiple times! Eventually Lowe's changed an another contractor and did the measurement.

The second step is to order the door, but it's been four months, they keep ordered wrong size of door, and never notify me early. I have to always PTO on the scheduled date, but all ends up they cannot do the installation due to wrong size or door!

Totally waste of my time and such poorly experienced!!!Every time I talked to their manager, they always said they will fix the issue, but never happened! I strongly feel like they are not treating customer seriously!

The issue still not fix yet, I really cannot believe Lowe's has such bad support!!!</text><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

<Text>I ordered one washing machine and one dryer. However, during the delivery day, there are 2 mistakes: no stacking kit and wrong wire so they did not install it for us. So I went to store to change the correct wire and buy stacking kit and rescheduled the installation. However, the installation was somehow cancelled by the store on the morning of the scheduled day. So I called the store and they said they will schedule another installation. However, the contractor delivery company said they did not receive such request. I had to call back to the store and then nobody could help me with it. Good job to mess up such simple thing.<//Text>< GmapID>

Online orders sent to wrong stores. Can’t get anyone on a phone to figure out where my product is or if it can be transferred to the right store from all over the valley. But someone kept hanging up on me, no wait music or anything. F- from an old retail manager.<//review>

<text>I was looking for some string lights for my backyard. I found 1 box in the garden area, but I needed 3; I  asked 2 employees if they had any more and they said no and that that was all they had. I checked with a 3rd employee....I asked him to check inventory and he said they had 30+ in stock. After that, no body knew where to find them!!!! I started walking around and found them myself. That is perfectly okay, but I think employees should know where to direct the customers.... customer service -0 stars.....</text>< Rate>

Waited an hour to find out a dishwasher I ordered was not really in stock. Turns out display models are also counted as stock. The delivery in 3-7 days to store is also not real as advertised! Waste of time.</Text>

While I am on my hands and knees trying to get  3 cases of matching 18" tiles that was on the floor in the back of the bay, two employees were sitting at the flooring desk  just chatting away.  Since I am 66 yrs young, I would have expected at least one of them to offer to help.  Not blaming the employees since management must allow this.  Ran a successful plumbing business for 40 years and always thought the most unproductive location for a leader was behind a desk looking at a computer monitor.  Hopefully someone is watching the staff because the staff should be taking care of the customers.< /text>

On December 22nd I got a call from the delivery company with a 4 hour delivery window - so far so good.  After waiting for the delivery, at the end of the 4 hour window, no one showed up.  When I called to see if they were running late, I was told that they needed a smaller truck to make the delivery and that they wouldn't actually be delivered that day... which no one bothered to tell me until I called them and they had apparently known about since the beginning of the delivery window!  But it gets better.  I couldn't' get any answer from the delivery company as to when it might actually be delivered, so I then spent over an hour on the phone with Lowe's (corporate, not the store itself, because after multiple attempts to call, no one picked up), who was in turn on hold with the delivery company, and at the end of the hour still couldn't give me any more information on when it might get delivered.  Lowe's then told me I should speak with the delivery company about getting some kind of reimbursement for my time, not Lowe's .  I was also told that the regional manager of the delivery company would be calling me by the end of the next day.  That was a week ago. I still have yet to hear anything from them.  So, I called Loews again... on December 28th.  I was finally told they could deliver it on Sunday (December 29th) and I should get a phone call later to confirm the delivery window.  At 9:30pm that night before the delivery, I get a phone call from Lowe's AGAIN saying they actually can't deliver it on Sunday!  After asking for a partial refund, I was offered $50 for the inconvenience.  I have spent 4 hours of my time, which I had to take off work for, waiting for a delivery that never came.  I have also spent several hours of my time on the phone trying (and failing miserably) to get any kind of answer about when it might be delivered and have experienced an immense amount of frustration in the process.  Apparently my time is not worth much at all to Lowe's though since I was offered $50 for the inconvenience (less than minimum wage at this point).  To top it all off, I STILL DON'T HAVE A DELIVERY SCHEDULED!!!!  This is a complete nightmare and I will never purchase anything from Lowe's again and will make sure to actively recommend to anyone I know to never order anything from Lowe's either if they can get the same thing elsewhere.  I could have ordered the exact same product for the same price from Home Depot or Costco - and they will absolutely have my business next time.< /text><UserId.>115442982074104516027<//UserId.><Pictures>None< /Pictures><username>Susan<//username><time>1577833524005<//time><gmap_id>0x808fcc098cc77683:0x7d8284a3f988ca14<//gmap_id></record>

Compared to another major competitior (aka HD), Lowe's feels refreshing. The aisles are wide and clean compared to the competition. The selection was also better than other hardware stores in the area. Frankly, I do not shop at hardware stores as frequently ever since the local ACE and then Orchard supply closed in West San Jose. Following a disappointing shopping trip at the HD last weekend, I decided to visit this Lowe's, and it exceeded expectations. I am aware of restructuring at the organization but hopefully this store does not close.</review>

Do not purchase any appliances from Lowes. I will give 0 star if Google review has that function. Worst shopping experience ever. I bought washer and dryer from Lowes during Thanksgiving. They have failed/rescheduled 5 times of my delivery. Lowes pass their delivery and installation to a 3rd party logistics company. You paid at Lowes but the Lowes customer service will not be responsible for delivery. They ask you to cancel the order if they miss the delivery. I paid to Lowes, not the 3rd party logistics company! Why I need to deal with 3rd party logistics company and Lowes is not responsible for anything?! I saw so many people having similar experience like mine in the Google review and I don't think Lowes is taking any actions to improve this. So customers, do not purchase from Lowes anymore. You have so many other options like home depot or Best Buy.<//text>

This store is either seriously understaffed or mismanaged, or both.  Most of time when I shop there, I couldn’t find anyone to help me. And when I had problems with my order, help was nowhere to be found.

I had placed an order on Black Friday at this store. Upon delivery, I found out the cooktop was missing.

I had started my kitchen remodeling expecting to have a cooktop to install. It is Christmas time and I have folks over for Christmas and now I am without a cooktop.

Tried to reach the store but no one ever picked up. Contacted 1-800 customer support which promised me someone at the store would reach out to me. Never happened. Next day customer support escalated to store manager level and said now the store manager would call me back. Never happened. Next day they escalated to district manager level. I doubt the DM would call me so I asked the customer rep at 1-800 number to call the store again for me.

This time finally we were able to reach the store manager. I explained the whole situation to her and her only defense was why didn’t I call the store directly?  She didn’t comment once I told her that’s exactly what I had been doing but no one ever answered the phone.

The 1-800 customer support promised me compensation for this fiasco and said the store manager would have to issue it. I tried asking her about it. She didn’t even want to discuss it. She said she would like to find out where my cooktop is before discussing anything else.  Not a single apology.

Thanks for ruining my Christmas.

Update: I have just been informed that my cooktop order was, I quote, “butchered”.   I don’t know how that is even legal—I meant they took my money for a whole month and now they are telling me the order wasn’t placed? They offered to redo the order but I have to wait another 21 days for it to arrive.  To their credit, they did offer a discount on the cooktop but a discount on an item which I never received?  Wouldn’t I be better off just cancel the order and buy it elsewhere? At least I will keep my sanity that way. How is any of this acceptable?<//text>

Bad experience for store pick-up orders. I ordered a water heater which shows in stock at this store. It charged me full amount of money but the order status is always "in process".
Tried to call customer service of this store but nobody answer.
Can't believe such store (charged money and do nothing) could survive in this country.<//Review>

Poor service. I thought home depot was bad, Lowes takes the cake. You would think they owed me money,  as soon as a lowes employee saw me they'd run the other way. You can count on 2 registers for your returns. Oh yeah and they are always empty because they have some  other more important thing that came up as soon as they see you in line.  They have taken rudeness to the next level. Just a whole bunch people that hate to work for lowes I guess</Text>

<Review>I frequent many Lowe's / Home Depot and my experience here last night was amazing.

This store should be the model store for all Lowe's to follow.

Paint Section - My friend picked up paint and the worker actually asked what the paint is being used for.  She took the time to explain what texture is recommended and the difference between the prices.  Excellent!

Flooring Section - A worker came out of nowhere to ask if she could help and walked over to show where the items could be found.  Excellent!

Appliance Section - Jason came to help and took a lot of time to explain the many differences. When to buy to get the lowest price. Even showed the model rooms to show the newer colors and how certain sizes can look like.  He was very knowledgeable and really seemed to want to help!  Made recommendations and even mentioned which brands to stay away from.  Excellent!

Tools Section - Ian.  I don't know what he's doing here.  The guy should be running his own contractor business.  All I wanted to know was to know how to use my nail gun, but I walked out learning all the different uses for an air compressor.  Ian is VERY passionate about housing projects and it's very helpful to talk to him.  Super Excellent!

I never thought I'd say going to Lowe's was an amazing experience but this one really was!  Please give this one a try!< /Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMVy0bPisAA2ODokqRPIgpGko92_IM4CVwKnDIz=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures><resp>None<//resp>< GmapID>

Never try to reach anyone by phone to resolve an issue at this store. You can spend days trying to get through with no luck. You either get stuck in an endless loop on their automated phone system or if you are lucky and someone picks up, they disconnect you when they try to transfer you to the person or department that you need to talk to. What a waste of time.< /Text>

Worst customer service and delivery service I'm the world! Is the second time they cancel the delivery of my dryer and no explanation was provided. Now they are promising the delivery again for tomorrow, who knows what will happen. The agents on the phone have no answer to give when you call, they are just reading their scripts and never answered questions. If you buy something here install it by your self and don't schedule a delivery!!!<//Text>

<Review>A lot better than Home Depot but often times it's hard to find help and a store is so big once you get beyond the mid-span there's nobody around to guide me they should have telephone intercom where if you're looking for a product you can press a button and ask somebody at the service desk other than that it's clean and well-stocked a lot better than Home Depot<//Review>< user_id>

Lowes is my favorite hardware store and this one is right by my house. I found this store well stocked with many interesting plants in the garden section. I went for high nitrogen fertilizer and was able to find it easily.</Review>

No one could help me find an item. No experts around just young kids.  I went to rhe service desk and they said it should be on the back wall but would not show me. I had to Leave without finding the item. I did buy 10 bags of mulch, but again there was no one to help me load it into my car. Waited 10 minutes and then ended up doing it myself. I'm a 55 year old female 135lbs.<//text>

Very convenient, near my house and always well stocked. Personally I normally don’t need or ask for help so I can really review that part but as far as the place goes it’s always clean and organized.<//Review>

<text>Dealing with this particular location has been an absolute nightmare. We have gone without an oven for over 4 months because of their complete incompetence. First, we waited weeks to find out that someone had forgotten to even place the order for our new oven. Then, after waiting again, we are told that they need to come take measurements before placing the order (why this wasn't mentioned earlier is anybody's guess). Finally, measurements were taken and the order placed. The oven arrived at the store and we are told we need to make an appointment for installation which ended up being a couple weeks out. Fine, whatever, we just need an oven, we already had to do without one for Thanksgiving. Today was installation day and we received a phone call one hour before they were scheduled to arrive to inform us that a 2 person team was required for installation which they don't have available today and the next available appointment is next Saturday. Tried calling the store to discuss this issue with the manager but she has already left for the day at 2pm on a friday. Given the way things have gone thus far, I doubt we will even have an oven for Christmas this year. Would give negative stars if that was an option.< /text>< userid>

<rating>2< /rating><review>While the staff in paint and plumbing were quite helpful and knowledgeable, there definitely aren't enough of them. But by far the worst part of my experience with Lowe's is with their installation department. I had scheduled an appointment to have a garbage disposal installed and was go liven an appointment window from 9-12am on a Monday. I scheduled the day off from work since I really needed this done and waited until 2pm for my installer to show up. Unfortunately I didn't realize that he had attempted to call me around 10am. I called Lowe's to make sure that my appointment would still be held and the woman in the installation department lied say "Oh it looks like you missed your appointment. My  technician called and waited for you for 20 minutes and then had to leave for another service appointment."
I informed her that that was not true; that I had been waiting at home all day and no one showed up. She then began to backtrack, saying that he was waiting for my call and because I hadn't called he hadn't shown up. Really?
No one told me that when I made the appointment! If I make an appointment with a client you better believe I show up even if they don't answer my call. So unprofessional! I was not offered an apology  or even a hint or remorse over the fact that my time had been wasted. Do yourself a favor and go to Home Depot instead!<//review>< Pics>

Selection is good, yet, I went in for 6 pieces of wood. I had them cut down to size. When I got home with the pieces, they were cut the wrong size. So have to load them back up, bring them back and recut. Should have checked the size after cutting instead of allowing professionals take care of it. My fault.</text>

While the staff in paint and plumbing were quite helpful and knowledgeable, there definitely aren't enough of them. But by far the worst part of my experience with Lowe's is with their installation department. I had scheduled an appointment to have a garbage disposal installed and was go liven an appointment window from 9-12am on a Monday. I scheduled the day off from work since I really needed this done and waited until 2pm for my installer to show up. Unfortunately I didn't realize that he had attempted to call me around 10am. I called Lowe's to make sure that my appointment would still be held and the woman in the installation department lied say "Oh it looks like you missed your appointment. My  technician called and waited for you for 20 minutes and then had to leave for another service appointment."
I informed her that that was not true; that I had been waiting at home all day and no one showed up. She then began to backtrack, saying that he was waiting for my call and because I hadn't called he hadn't shown up. Really?
No one told me that when I made the appointment! If I make an appointment with a client you better believe I show up even if they don't answer my call. So unprofessional! I was not offered an apology  or even a hint or remorse over the fact that my time had been wasted. Do yourself a favor and go to Home Depot instead!<//review>

Large parking, easy access. Regular large home improvement warehouae. Personnel helpful and polite. Large choices for paint, sanitary plumbing gardening, etc. Sometime you can get super deal on plants on their sales rack. Outdoor garden center is large and has almost all your need for gardening. Some limitation on pots. Entrance of parking lot is not great. Need to make a turn on a side walk, not great.< /text>

Visited this store more than 10 times. I always had very good experience with Moulding and Millwork staff. They are friendly and super helpful, especially Shanon. I took away 1 star because of the front-desk customer service staff when it comes to return and pickup later orders.</text>

I usually come here for pots, somehow here has more options that I like. The gardening section is the best. The staff inside are very knowledgeable and helpful. That's why I rather drive further to come here shopping.< /text>

Employees were very nice. BUT, when I got to check out only the self checkout was open. I had to wait while because the machine was questioning how much my potting soil weighed. Then I had to purchase my shopping bag if I wanted one. Is this the solution to the increase in the minimum wage?? I'll go to Home Depot next time.< /review>

I bought a refrigerator two weeks ago and they promised delivery within 3days. Called them today for follow up and they said they didn’t have my correct contact phone # so they can’t call for delivery confirmation. My information already on their database since this is not my first purchase. They promised another two days.
Addition to my review: last time I called they promised delivery by yesterday 9/8/18. I waited until 2pm, no call, no delivery absolutely nothing. I called them again and got transferred to delivery team for status and got hung up after a long period of hold times.
We bought the refrigerator on August 18 so I told my husband to go straight to the store, since we have no times for this. My husband came to the store at 7pm and was told the refrigerator is still at the the store and they did not know the reason why. We canceled it and bought the same one on Amazon which will arrive on Tuesday. I have nothing else to say but sorry for those we had the same experience.<//text>

<Rating>1< /Rating><Review>Canceled my web pick up order and provided no cancellation notification whatsoever. Here I was, sitting like an idiot for over a week waiting to receive an order pickup notice. The order was most likely canceled because the price was "too low" after my use of a coupon despite the San Francisco location having them on clearance for less than half the price of this store and others in the area. Now SF is sold out and I'm unable to get it at any location without paying full price. So not only did they cancel my order, they prevented me from being able to get it at a different location. Way to waste my time. I was also going to do a bigger project and get a water heater installation but I guess I'll be going elsewhere for that too.</Review>< pics>

I had ordered over 4k worth of appliances with a store representative. Delivery was set only to have only two of the appliances delivered,  then rescheduled the others only to have them fail to deliver again. No customer service either. What a nightmare.  So disappointed in how Lowes has handled it as well.</Text>

< review>
I went to the store at 6 am on a Monday. The employees acted as if they did not want to be working there and that my mere presence was inconvenient for them.   I came into the store to buy two specific items bug spray and batteries. I could not find the batteries and I circled the store two and a half times looking for the batteries that I want it. Not one employee offer to help me again they all acted as if I was in their way and an inconvenience. I headed to the front of the store and decided I wanted to look at the magazine and book racks, located next to the registers. There was a wooden pallet with product and my way making it unsafe for me to even shop in the area. The employee didn't offer to move the pallets he watched me as I climbed over.

After selecting a book I went to the registers to pay for my 3 items totaling approximately $60. No employees were at the cash registers which forced me to use the self help registers.  I had problems with the register because it did not recognize the batteries but I just bring up and it would not allow me to scan my next product. There was no one around to help me other than one employee you again after that if he didn't even see me and kept right on ignoring me. How does complete and utter frustration I walked out of the store and left my three items at the registers.   LOWES STORE MANAGER:  if you want to keep customers coming to your business I suggest that you open up registers in the morning but before you do that I suggest you train your stuff to be more friendly and to not be rude. Another reason why I absolutely despise big box companies such as Lowe's. One thing for certain I will not be shopping here again.<//review>

Dealing with this particular location has been an absolute nightmare. We have gone without an oven for over 4 months because of their complete incompetence. First, we waited weeks to find out that someone had forgotten to even place the order for our new oven. Then, after waiting again, we are told that they need to come take measurements before placing the order (why this wasn't mentioned earlier is anybody's guess). Finally, measurements were taken and the order placed. The oven arrived at the store and we are told we need to make an appointment for installation which ended up being a couple weeks out. Fine, whatever, we just need an oven, we already had to do without one for Thanksgiving. Today was installation day and we received a phone call one hour before they were scheduled to arrive to inform us that a 2 person team was required for installation which they don't have available today and the next available appointment is next Saturday. Tried calling the store to discuss this issue with the manager but she has already left for the day at 2pm on a friday. Given the way things have gone thus far, I doubt we will even have an oven for Christmas this year. Would give negative stars if that was an option.< /Text>

Beverly in the Window covering department is THE BEST person to work with. She is super knowledgable, fast, very helpful and provides great ideas for your project. I highly recommend going to this Lowes for your window covering needs. Thanks Beverly for a great experience !< /review>

And as always the saddest plant selection. Went to Lowes and of course 2 times the size of HD's garden center and way better quality and more variety! Yes most things are $1 or $2 more but you get so much more at Lowes. Scfew the depot and go to Lowes. Rudder park staff always super nice, knowledgeable and helpful. A++< /text>< Pictures>

I was there to shop for shower doors. I asked a associate passing by to please get me help I want to see what they had in stock or if I needed to order what we are looking for. We waited 10 mins someone came by and did help another couple that was there..I walk away to next aisle and came back everyone was gone. I walked ovet to front of store asked for help again waited 20 more mins no one came by... Asked another assistance passing by to call someone waited another 10 mins and left...</review>

Lowes is better for me in my area as Home Depot is across from the movie theaters at the Great Mall. That creates parking issues competing with movie goers. The prices are about the same at either store. Never really had any problems finding parking at Lowes.< /Review>

<text>Went to my neighborhood Lowe's to get a replacement valve for my Delta sink faucet. I found one by Danco in their faucet parts. It kinda looks like the one that's in there now. No one around to ask, no cross reference booklet. Hoping I don't have to return it.</text>< Pics>

I have called 3 stores just to ask a question and I'm put on hold until the line goes busy or the operator does not even answer the call..REALLY bad customer service. I got much better service from OSH.</review>

Even to the point where it gets awkward for the customer.  Where are all the hard working people in the world.

<Text>Nice place to shop with lot of open parking. They were out of stock with weather liners when we went there and customer service can get better. Basically no one asks you if they can help and finding a customer rep to take help is a challenge in this store.< /Text>< Pics>

Never find anything you're looking for. Don't stock stuff that home Depot always carries. Not to mention the Lowe's surcharge making everything pricier.<//Text>

The individuals who work the floor are friendly and helpful but there aren't nearly enough of them.  There are never ANY cashiers - only self checkout.  One helper for 8 stations.  I HATE being yelled at by a machine.  I miss clerks who actually smile and wish me good day.  Only go there because it is close but am driving to OSH or Home Depot more often .< /text>

<Text>After a long week and busy unproductive day off i settled down to BBQ. After getting a nice sear on one side the propane ran out around 9:15pm. Lowes has Blue Rhino 20lb tanks prefilled to 75% with 15lb for $15 exchange and  I'm off. Wait need gas and air up tires. Get to lowes 9:53 remove tank from rv. Head for the exit to enter because the registers are right there and you pay first after leaving empty tank by blue rhino cage. Cashier is free, no line, great. He turns around, sees me, and in  his matronly retail voice said, "We're closed," with distain.
I replied, i just need one thing, a tank of propane and i have my empty for exchange outside.
"I don't have a key and the other managers are busy doing their closing lists."
Big Mary is a manager! not just a cashier? You go gerl. He can remember his, I'm smart glasses, but not his propane key or how to be polite to customers who might be a little dirty at the end of a long day of home repairs utilising the plethora of items purchased from Lowes recently.
"I can call one of the "other" managers (the ones who didnt loose their Blue Rhino cage key) and have them unlock the cage if you would like. It might be a couple minutes, thought (ya ya they're busy with their closing lists, you covered that earlier. I may be tired, dirty and hungry but not stupid, condescending or rude. You will need to look in a mirror for an example of what those look like in combination) would have been acceptable. I know the store is closing and i rushed in late, because i was cooking late and ran out of propane late. Not because i was eating late on the summer continental schedule, but because i was working late like everyone here.
But this option was not offered and from the tone in his voice and the look i recieved as he turned his back to me walking to the exit door and wishing me in his "Dear God, please kill me, kill me now" retail voice, "Have a good evening" ("ba by" rang through loud and clear. I new without ramping things up to 11 i would not be getting any propane at Lowes and left. Home Depot is around the corner. I was going to race over and see if they would help me out. But, I was now more tired and just whent home.
For the record, i hope he is straight. The gay community has enough freaks in it allready.
Tonight, Thurs i stoped into the Lowes on Night Ridder in SJ and to add insult to injury the Blue Rhino 15 lb (25% empty. A 20 lb tank is rated for and designed to hold 20 lbs and it still has the governments reserve area for safe expansion preventing a failure) tank was now $19.99.
Two trips, a ruined dinner, dropped and broke the regulator when reloding tank into camper and a 25% price increase. Did i hear someone say OSH? I will continue to patronize Lowes. I have had more good experiences than dissapointing ones. The ratio between them is getting pretty flat and seems to be accelorating as it approaches 1:1.</Text></record></dataset><record>

Worse Custome Service in Appliances and installation department. Its been more than 3 weeks we are having trouble to get hold of installer. I regret buying and selecting lowes for installation. Pls don’t ever buy any new appliances with installation service from lowes. First installation schedule happened after 10 days and then they called last minute says they got damaged microwave and they will have it installed in next two days. Now its been more 15days installation is not scheduled. They charge for installation service in advance and don’t even refund so Now we are stuck and have to wait.< /Text>

<Text>The individuals who work the floor are friendly and helpful but there aren't nearly enough of them.  There are never ANY cashiers - only self checkout.  One helper for 8 stations.  I HATE being yelled at by a machine.  I miss clerks who actually smile and wish me good day.  Only go there because it is close but am driving to OSH or Home Depot more often .</Text></record></dataset><record>

This store doesn't know what the left hand from the right hand is doing when it come to internet orders.  On three different days trying to get the order filled and shipped I asked to speak with the manager.   Each day there wasn't a manager in for the day to speak with.  Who in the heck is ruling the roost?<//Text>

Does not carry laundry baskets. I miss Orchard Supply Hardware.  OSH carried more complete stock. They also don't accept Bitcoin while many other Silicon Valley business now accept Bitcoin and people in this area now expect to be able to use BTC.</text>

UPDATE: manager stepped in when I asked for a refund. Potentially may be discounting the item. I appreciate that kind of reaction and probably will update this

Plenty of time to write this poor review as I wait for my in-store pickup of an online order. After i received two unnecessary phone calls to confirm my online order, stood in line at the pickup location at Lowe's, the team still didn't have the item ready. I have been standing here for 15 minutes waiting for them to retrieve it with no end in sight.

Not only is this pickup less convenient than just buying in-store, it's actually been quite a disappointing display of customer service after voicing my issue. Seriously, look at how long this review is. I've been standing in the middle of the pick up area angrily writing this and not one hint of an employee taking action.

20 minutes I've been waiting now for my "convenient" online pickup.<//Text>

< Review>
Paint department is weak! Noone had a clue what they were doing. Super long wait time. Taking orders and delivery paint out of order. Mixing the wrong colors for customers.

Now a few weeks later I'm back here trying to spend hundreds of dollars on a miter saw. Online says they have plenty in stock but when I check they have none on the floor. After being told "this isn't my area" and "I'm on break" I finally find someone to ask if they have anymore in back or else where. I'm told again "this isn't my area, did you check online?"
I laughed and walked away.</Review>

<Gmap_id>0x808fcc098cc77683:0x7d8284a3f988ca14< /Gmap_id><Pictures>None< /Pictures><text>I walk in the store and I'm in the need of a trailer. I've never purchased one before but I know what size I need. I see a 4x6 at the entrance but it's not the size I'm looking for. so 20 feet from the trailer I walk over to the cashier and ask if they have any other trailers I could look at. He tells me he doesn't know of any others. Standing in the same spot, in HIS line of site, I notice 2 other trailers sitting there. He didn't get my sarcasm, but I threw it his way anyways. "What about those?" I ask. With the dumbfounded look on his face he had nothing to say.
I walk over to the trailers and notice they're on sale and they are exactly what I was hoping for. I picked the better one of the two (one had broken light lenses). I go up to the check out desk to make the purchase but was told only 1 person in the store handles the DMV stuff. Of course, the person (John) wasn't there. She said he would be in in a bit. I asked her if he could call me when he got in, gave her my number and pleaded with her to PLEASE have him call me since we drove a distance to get this.
We tool around in the area for a few hours, no call from John. We go back to the store and when we pull in we see a fire truck, and an ambulance. i said out loud to my kids, "Watch, this will be thrown in my face!"
I go back to the desk (we're now over 3 hours into this) and I tell the person behind the counter we were expecting a call from John. Her reply, (with a healthy dose of attitude) "Well, you see what's  happening with the emergency vehicles out front, we've been a little busy!" And there it is... thrown in my face as I suspected. I wasn't rude or pushy, but may have had a slight bit of frustration in my demeanor as I was sympathetic to to whatever situation was brewing with the fire trucks. Apparently, John is also the only person who can handle emergencies, too!
4 hours into it, I'd yet to mean this Super John. finally, someone came up to assist us. I looked at the name tag and it said Juan. I thought maybe that was the John they were talking about. Then a few minutes later John walks up. I say nothing about the hours I've spent waiting for this transaction. Finally, hours later, we START the purchase. As I'm doing the paperwork I ask which one he is writing up, and noted that I wanted the one that didn't have broken lights. He said he picked the one he picked because the other had broken lights. Cool! I assumed we were on the same page.
Finally, about 5.5 hours from when I arrived at the store, we're done. I ask how the paperwork is handled with the DMV. He specifically told me that LOWE's would take care of all that and that I would receive the plates in the mail from the DMV. I confirm, "I don't have to do anything else, and they plates will be sent to me?" "Yep!' he says.
They tell me to meet them at the back of the store, at the back door where the trailer is parked and they will be right there. I drive around, wait 10 minutes, 10 minutes longer, then finally i see movement. Out comes the trailer. As we're attaching it to my hitch, I notice the light lens is broke. He tries to right the situation by grabbing a new lens and putting it on, which was nice. As he's walking away I notice one of the marker lights is also cracked open. I just wanted to get the hell out of that place! I didn't say anything about the 2nd light.
I wait a couple of months for the plates, but get nothing. I read the paperwork and it says it takes a while, and to call DMV if you haven't received the plates in 60 days. Well, i gave it LOTS of extra time... 5 months to be exact! So finally I call DMV. I give them the VIN number only to find it's not in their system. She asks me what paperwork I'm looking at. When I tell her, she is able to quickly decipher that Lowe's gave me completely wrong information. I was supposed to go to the DMV and bring the paperwork so they could register it in their system.
This place simply sucks!<//text><Name>Johnny Come Lately< /Name><Rating>1</Rating></record>

<text>This is the worst service I have ever experienced! If you have an old refrigerator and want to buy a new one. DO NOT BUY IT FROM LOWES! The "haul-away and deliver" is a total lie. I have to reschedule 3 times for the haul-way service. And every time they are at least 3 hours late.<//text>< time>

<Text>I called Both Lowe's in San Jose and the one in Sunnyvale, was never able to get anyone on the phone. It rang close to 20 times, than when I pressed 0 again it rang way too many times and nobody ever answered.. Maybe they should hire someone to answer their phones or someone who's working there can answer.. Very frustrating when trying to get information before driving all over town.</Text>< userid>

We went to the store after work to buy a fridge. No one is willing to help. They acted very impolite and disrespected as we asked for help. Is it how Lowe should treat their customers? You should just buy online... at least you dont have to deal with those people<//Review>

<Review>It's your standard Lowe's experience. However, this location was a bit strange, as you can see it from the freeway but you have to go in a huge circle to get to it. Also, there's nothing else in the same plaza, except for a dialysis place and a wingstop.< /Review>< pics>

<rating>1< /rating><Review>The appliance department is the worst ! On the week before Memorial weekend, I asked for the ons  ale electric range is available or not. The guy ( I should have get his name ) I talked to did not seem interesting to answer it since I guessed it's a cheaper price range that cost $427.
He then check he computer and found another one available in the other store and said he can ask them to ship it to this store. Then he got my name and phone number and the home address in the computer, Then I asked him if I should pay it now. He said no and will call when  the range is here in a week or so. 2 weeks later I dropped by and asked for the status from another sale person since I did not saw him at that moment. But she said there's no record indicating my name and phone number at all. That jerk was standing there and pretended he has nothing to the order he's entered. So the  sales lady told me I should have paid earlier. I told her I did asked for paying for it but he said no. What a bozo ! Wasting other people valuable time .
I then went to Best Buy on Stevens Creek and found the same one. The service is amazing compare to this idiot. I dont go to Lowes anymore eventhough it''s the closest to my house. And I told all my friends and families to aware about this place.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None<//Response><gmap_id>0x808fcc098cc77683:0x7d8284a3f988ca14<//gmap_id></record>

Needs serious improvement on customer service.  Waited for somebody in tools section  for almost 15mins after requesting for help and nobody showed up.  Than I come to cash register section and there are guys there doing nothing.  I guess i just came in this store twice at the wrong time or something i guess..</Review>
