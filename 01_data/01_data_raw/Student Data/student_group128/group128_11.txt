I always try to support local businesses and this one definitely did not disappoint! My grandmother gave me a diamond ring that was her grandmother's. It was in need of restoration and Roper's Jewelers did an amazing job. I only wish I had taken a before picture to compare the difference! A ring that is at least one hundred years old looks brand new and will continue being handed down in my family. Thank you thank you thank you!<//review>

I always consider Ropers family friendly since I knew of them as a child.
I have gone to them for very important pieces to me tho not very expensive.  And have been given the most respect.
Again today I went with many pieces important to me. Prices were reasonable and help was fantastic and personable. Thank you Roper's Jewlers</text>

I was tired of the big box store experience. I sought out a local jewelry store; wanting my money to stay local and benefit a small business. The moment we walked in it was a fit. Val paid great attention to our wants and provided superb service. There was never a "we can't do that".  Thank you Roper's, you have earned my business always.<//review>

To have them looked at and reset as I had lost a stone and was very close to losing more. They did an amazing job on the settings of both rings. They are 15-35 years old and now they look brand new. And while I was there I got a new little diamond heart pinky ring for my birthday that they sized on site!

The people are so lovely here, I brought my grandmothers ring in to be sized and looked over.They did fix a couple loose stones and I’m so grateful. When I picked the ring up, I was in awe, it was clean and shiney! I will be bringing them more items to clean and fix! The price was very reasonable! Thank you so much! Love Ropers Jewelers!<//Review>

Roper's Jewelers are wonderful! They are professional and welcoming.  They are the best jewelers in Auburn and I have lived here for 20 years. It is always a pleasure to visit their store whether  I am shopping, getting a new watch battery, or repairing an old piece of jewelry. Such great people.</review>

<text>I went in to Ropers to find an anniversary gift for my girlfriend, the staff there was so kind and helpful, that I found the perfect necklace for her. The owner of the store herself took a lot of care and attention in helping me find the perfect gift, she even went the extra mile a wrapped it with a beautiful bow. PS. My girlfriend absolutely LOVES IT!!!

Very helpful staff addressed my cracked watch crystal and helped me choose a different watch for work (I’m a farmer.).  But the new watch was on sale, and she rang up the bill without taking into account the discount.  She didn’t know how to fix the problem, so it took two people to sort out, reversing the sale, and then doing the correct sale.< /review>

We came in to the store with some very precious family heirloom jewelry and stones and needed them set into a custom ring setting. We also had 3 custom necklaces made for Christmas gifts. We also fell in love with 2 rings from their in-store display & purchased for an anniversary gift, which came complete with custom gift wrapping. This store carries gorgeous jewelry and has a huge selection of modern and classic designs. I would highly recommend them for the selection and attention to detail in custom designs. Peggy provided excellent customer service, talked us through the experience and kept us up-to-date on the entire customization process. We would not trust our family jewelry work and care to anyone else.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

Over the years my wife and I have come to form a very valuable and trusted relationship with the team at Roper’s Jewelry. Whenever items of concern regarding existing jewelry or items of interest, they have always met our requests and expectations. From the design of a custom piece to the precision matching of an existing gemstone for matching earrings, the enthusiasm and execution have never fallen short. That’s why they are the areas store of choice and we will be lifelong clients.< /Text>

I am absolutely thrilled with the beautiful ring I purchased (and modified several times!) from Roper's in North Auburn.  Val was particularly helpful and knowledgeable, though everyone I dealt with was great.  My husband  and I bought the ring to replace my damaged original wedding band, and I  decided I  wanted to 'upgrade ' it a tad.  Val was very patient and had great suggestions, as did Peggy, as well.  I've sinced added earrings to my 'wish list' for Santa (which they conveniently keep on their computer), and know I will be back!  Their service and selection are great, and pricing fair.  Absolutely stunning pieces on display!< /review>

I had multiple pieces of jewelry that needed repairs and thought it would cost a fortune but was very reasonable and done in less then a week. The staff are wonderful and I highly recommend Ropers. They have been in Auburn far longer then me but I would never go anywhere else.  It is great to support a local business that is so involved in the community and truly care. You won't be disappointed!!!</Text></record>

The folks here at Roper’s do take good care of their customers. I’ve been a customer since 1990 and have never had a bad deal or bad service. They do take good care of my rings  when I bring in for checks and cleanings. Awesome group of folks!< /Review>

My mom’s wedding ring was in dire shape, has dropped one stone and was about to lose the rest after 55 years of being worn nonstop, everyday... the staff at Ropers was so friendly, helpful, and did such a wonderful job repairing and resetting the stones! I’ve never seen the ring look that beautiful. Thank you Ropers! You have no idea how much this means to my family.< /text>

Thank you Peggy at Rope’s Jewelers for helping me design my new wedding ring setting! I appreciated the advice and also patience in making this important decision! It looks beautiful! Helping me recycle my old gold setting helped me keep the cost down as well. Thanks for the friendly and helpful service!</Review>

After trying other jewelers in town, I went back to the best of the best!
Ropers is fair, trustworthy, and personal.
With research and  persistence, the jeweler made the piece that I hoped. Better yet, it was in my budget.
Professional. Personal. Affordable!!</text>

This has been a place where my family has gone for years and the last couple experiences for my parents have been bad and then my last two times have been horrible. I took my wife’s engagement ring in along with her wedding band and got a ring guard made. We had to take it back to size it up because it was too small. When we got it back they had shaved out the inside of it to size it up and then cut into the band of the engagement ring to make it fit in the ring guard... rather than size up the shanks! Makes me so mad! And at the end of it all, it still didn’t fit, it didn’t even look like it was sized up at all! So I got a ring back to give to my wife for our 1 year, hallowed out, cut into, not fitting, and the ring guard is uneven around the ring. Shady, dishonest. I won’t be coming back.</text>

<review>Peggy was extremely helpful.  My husband and I wanted to add more bling to my existing ring for our 10th anniversary. Due to the unique shape of my ring, it was not a slam dunk. Her ideas were wonderful and I came away with an amazing ring and well under budget. Thanks Peggy!</review>< Pics>

My experience  with Roper's Jewelers was outstanding. My elderly mother and I came into Roper's to have work done on her wedding ring. She became ill while we were there and the staff at Roper's was so kind and helped us through it. The work done (combining my mom's and my dad's ring together as one and sizing it to fit my mom) was fantastic. It is beautiful! It was made just in time; I picked it up on Friday and she passed away on Sunday. Thank you Roper's, it was the last time I saw my mom smile. God Bless You<//text>

<Time>1553112632133<//Time><rate>5</rate><Text>Always very helpful and kind. I had a watch battery replaced that went out after only a few months. They changed it out on the spot no charge as they have a year warranty for battery replacements. We made a plan if it happened to go out again that the watch repair man could see if it needed some work as it’s an older watch. Of course while waiting I found a great pair of earrings. Happy gir!< /Text>< Pics>

I came in with a specific task to find a sterling silver chain for a pendant filled with my sons cremation ashes. I was greeted warmly and promptly and found what I wanted immediately thanks to the help of the sales associate. Very satisfied and impressed. Thank you very much Ropers!</text>

I have been coming to Roper's for years for all of my jewelry needs. This time it was to have a special ring made for my son-in-law. It is so above and beyond my expectations that I couldn't believe it. I appreciate the courtesy and the service that I receive every time I go there.  Thank you so very very much.< /text>

Ropers is always my first choice in reliable jewelers. Peggy at their North Auburn Store is my “go to” jewelry stylist when I want to fashion unusual jewelry from vintage, family heirlooms. The results are always stunning!
Thank you Peggy!  ⭐️ 👍👍👍 ⭐️

<text>The Food Is Healthy And Amazing I Normally Don't Like To Come To Places Like This But Teriyaki Inn, Is Just Different From Other Restaurants. And I Really Hope This Place Doesn't Shutdown Or Go Out Of Business, And Later On In The Future I Hope Teriyaki Inn Can Become I Bigger Thing And More People Can Know It A Lot More Often. So Thank You Teriyaki Inn< /text>< Pics>

<review>We're fairly new customers at Teriyaki Inn. The food is good and inexpensive. We particularly like their teriyaki sauce which they say is made fresh daily from fruits. It has a refreshing taste that's not as sweet as the typical fare.< /review><user>111435591571478713703</user></record></dataset><record>

Great food. Decent wait times, usually because fresh food takes time! If i wait for salmon to cook thats a good sign im not getting it old or pre-cooked. Salmon plate is really good. I myself love the macaroni salad.</review>

I was looking for an ice cream cake and thought who has good cake and makes their own ice cream and a small, local business? So I popped in, they let me pick my flavors, and it was twice the size of Coldstone or Baskin Robbins for the same price! It's so important to support our local businesses and definitely better quality than a chain. I will be back!< /text>

Not only do they have lots of sweets to choose from but they even make Torta's here! YUMMY!!< /review>< UserId.>

Best mexican bread ever, good taste but little too much sugar sprinkled on it,  i love their smoothies specially the paraiso and tropical, prices are great, the only but is that the pan bolillo is always in  a basket  without a cover!!!!<//Review>

The Gansito ice cream tastes exactly like a frozen Gansito on a hot summer day! I had it in a milkshake and lordy was I hooked. I also tried the prickly pear sorbet and was throughly impressed. I highly recommend this artisanal ice cream shop!< /Review>

The ice cream is killer. Tequila and prickly pear and pine nut, best flavors. Such a variety of flavors. There's a bakery but I haven't gotten around to trying it.</review>

<user>101995873150551061075< /user><Review>BEST tastes like homemade ICE CREAM EVER--HANDS DOWN. Try the Kahlua. The quarts are $7 and are so worth it. They weight 10 lbs! icy, but rich not "creamy" just rich rich flavor,  but with that Italian Icy-like texture with some creaminess. Very heavy DENSE. Not pumped with air...awesome...Kahlua made with real kahlua and just tastes incredible. I can't stop thinking about it some days...Enjoy!!<//Review></record>

Any combination of fruit popsicles you can think of. Homemade ice cream, my daughter has strawberry and vanilla swirl so good. I had a coconut popsicle which the shavings were so fresh and good. Can't wait to try more flavors next visit.</Review><Date>1539875332784</Date>< gmap_id>

Their pastries and breads are a true treasure!!! They are authentic and fresh. I go up to the sierras twice a month and bring family treats that can't be had around these parts ( even reno doesn't have as good as here) Try it you will love it!!!Don't forget tortas, fresh fruit smoothies and cakes on hand and special order as well!!!!!!!!!! Vallejo Gold!!!</Review>

<Review>(Translated by Google) Very antigenic, they take money and do not disinfect their hands, and so they grab the bread with their hands, they must use the pins and they do not. We are in a pandemic time they must be more igienic.

Great experience at my LensCrafters today. Worked with Robert to get new frames & lenses. Wonderful customer service even tho they seemed to be a little short on staff at the time. Robert was attentive yet managed to let others know they were important and would be taken care of shortly.</review>

I came in as I saw the 'RayBan prescription sunglass lenses' sign in the window. Although expensive $260 just for the lenses including installation, it's the only place I've found in 2 years of looking that sells RayBan prescription lenses. I'm looking forward to picking them up next week.< /Text>

Wilson was my customer service rep, I would only come back to lens crafters to get service from him.  I had to get my glasses replaced because the rx was incorrect the first time, he was extremely pleasant, helpful, respectful each time even though I was annoyed and made it a very pleasant experience.  Give him a raise so you can keep him, he’s great!!!</text>

<text>Dr seemed professional when we spoke (I assume it was the optometrist on the phone as she asked whether she had performed an eye exam for me before).  Staff (namely, Robert) provided truly the worst retail experience I remember having in my 37 years on planet earth.

I have been customer for 7 years and I can prove them that and I called in advance to see if they were able to help me due my store is close for covid.... I called and they talk to me very nice and say I was welcome to come.. when I show up on my working clothes they were unable to help me and could not do anything for me this guy....
Had to go back to pleasant hill wich is neither my regular but they are more helpfull.. I waste parking and time just to come and deal with this kind of people...<//Review>

<text>Dr. Nguyen was awesome! She was so nice and took the time to explain to me about what was going on with my vision. The staff was friendly as well and made me feel welcomed. I did not get the guys name that helped me out with selecting my glasses but he was such a big help and I enjoyed our movie conversation. Definitely will be back next year!</text><Time>1590729102646< /Time>< rate>

When we went there we had an hour and half before our flight. The doctor examined me and gave me a very accurate description. The salespeople made it smooth and easy for me to pick glasses and the lenses in an hour. They made it possible for me to actually get glasses that I have been procrastinating to get because how long usually eye exams take. I would really recommend going there.< /Text>

Normally I wouldn't write too negative of a review,  but I had the absolute most horrible experience at LensCrafter shop on market.  I came in for an annual eye exam, the process was okay, but they forgot to update my prescription expiration date!  how unprofessional!  When I called to ask for a correct prescription, they first hung up on me, and I called again they put me on a long hold, then they sent me the incorrect prescription again!! how can they stay in business with this level of professionalism?  Don't go there!!< /Review>

Robert Anaya was an absolute joy to work with! He was extremely attentive and patient throughout my entire shopping experience. His diligence and ability to provide insightful advice while I was selecting my frames made my shopping experience really exceptional. I cannot say enough about how fantastic Robert is.
The lab at this LenCrafters location is also superb! The turnaround time  from them to cut and install my lenses into my new frames was under half an hour!!

Next time I purchase glasses I will definitely make the 50+ mile commute up from south bay to this LensCrafter location again :)</Text>

Great experience with Dr.Nguyen. Terrible customer service at the front desk. Treated me poorly and when I complained about the extra charges they told me nothing about they asked me to be quiet so they can continue on with their other customers. I would not recommend this place.<//Review>

It seems that everybody is very polite in the office, BUT...
When I was ordering glasses, I was told they will call me to tell whenever I can pick them up. Three weeks after ordering, I decided to pop-up in the store, to check what's their progress. They told me they have tried to call me once, on Saturday afternoon. They could not get hold of me (Yes, I was outside the town where none of the carriers work), but they didn't leave voice mail, they didn't text me, they didn't write email to me. I was explained this is the policy. Sorry, but I do not take "we called you once and forgot about you" policy, I will bring my money somewhere else.</Text>

I wish I would have read all the comments before visiting this location. Worst service and hope I could give -ve rating.
Doctor provided me a strong prescription which was wrong and when I finally got my glasses made I could not even walk properly due to such horrible sight. I went to store again to get it fixed. Manager there tried to give me some stupid explanation as if my eyes are faulty.

After insisting I got to see the same doctor and she told me she will reduce the number by .50 in both eyes and I was like why at the first place you gave me a strong prescription. But it doesn't end here.

Again based on my second prescription they couldn't get me the correct glasses and finally after a weeks of struggle without my glasses I have to ask for refund. It has been a complete waste of money and time. They did not even say sorry or felt bad about the whole situation.< /review>

I cannot believe anyone would give this establishment  less than 5 stars. I came in expecting 3 star service (ONLY because of the ratings); therefore, I was shocked at how updated/amazing this "office" was and how wrong the negative reviews were.

I went in and scheduled an appointment with ease.

Everyone was very welcoming.

The ease of the paperwork was awesome, not 20 forms of the same questions.

Tony who did my "pre-exam", was so nice and explained everything to me and was very helpful and easy to talk to.

Dr. Jasmine Nguyen was the most knowledgeable, friendly, and helpful optometrist I have ever met.

I absolutely recommend this place to anyone and everyone!</text>

<Text>Have been going to this specific LensCrafters, going on (15-20) years for my exams, glasses and contacts.

The ongoing changing staff, have always been professional, attentive to my eyeglass needs.

I would recommend this store highly, to leave with a proper fitting pair of either eyeglasses or contact lenses.</Text><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None</Response><GmapID>0x808580886ac3768f:0xd301269ace121c22<//GmapID></record>

DO NOT GO to this LensCrafters! You may not regret it today, or tomorrow but they will absolutely make you regret your decision eventually. I was a customer years ago and then gave them another shot only to have them disappoint me again.

All of the office staff needs to be replaced. Not only do they not care at all about their customers they are also dishonest. They will say whatever it takes to get your money. I have never experienced such horrible ethics from people in the healthcare industry. It is a shame because the actual doctor I have is great and I would gladly see her if she worked at other facilities. I would tell you my whole story but it isn’t worth it because the moral of the story is do not go to this LensCrafters.< /Review>

<UserId.>107866881987155005595< /UserId.><Review>I cannot believe anyone would give this establishment  less than 5 stars. I came in expecting 3 star service (ONLY because of the ratings); therefore, I was shocked at how updated/amazing this "office" was and how wrong the negative reviews were.

I called and spoke with Cameron, super nice and helpful guy and he scheduled an eye exam for me that same day, actually just 2 hours before the appointment.

Ebony (security) at the front was so nice and very helpful and welcoming, actually everyone was very welcoming.

The ease of the paperwork was awesome, not 20 forms of the same questions. Also, my appointment was on time, which hardly happens at any doctor's office.

I can't remember the guy's name that did my "pre-exam", but he was so nice and explained everything to me and was very helpful and easy to talk to.

Dr. Jasmine Nguyen was the most knowledgeable, friendly, and helpful optometrist I have ever met.

I absolutely recommend this place to anyone and everyone!< /Review><username>Michael Helms< /username></record>

If I could, I would give zero star - the star here is for awesome doctor Nguyen who took care of me over emergency. There is no customer service at this place. When I ordered my contacts, they did not mention that they had problem pulling up my insurance and left me waiting for 3 weeks. When I called back and ask what happened, the guy who picked up the phone was really rude and told me that they were so busy and had no time returning all customers' call or emails. Excuse me? Isn't this part of the service that a customer is paying for when visiting LensCrafters? If you give no care about your business, then I guess there's no reason for us customers to come back.</Review>

I wish there was a way to assign negative stars to this place.  I went there a few weeks ago to order a pair of prescription sunglasses.  After choosing my frame and submitting my prescription,  I was told that it would take 3 days to get them ready.  I didn't hear back from them for a week and when I finally called them,  I was put on hold for a long time, but they finally came back and said that the lenses have arrived, but they haven't gotten around putting them on the frame yet!  She finally said that she would personally take ownership of the case and call me back in few hours.  I waited more than 30 hours, till the end of the next day and called them back again.  After being routed around a few times,  a person finally came back with a story to cover up their unbelievable incompetency and bad customer service.  He told me that the lenses have not passed the inspection and have to be reordered. But he never explained why they didn't bother to call even once to let me know what had happened! They had just screwed up and were making up stories to cover up.  I was told that I had to wait for at least another week!!  At this point I decided to call their corporate office and the person who answered the call promised to look into the matter and have the district manager call me back.  That was more than 2 weeks ago and I am still waiting for the call.
This was the first and the last time that I would ever go to Lenscrafters for my presentation glass needs.  Stay away from them if you don't want to go through a very frustrating and time wasting experience.<//review>

<Review>Craftspersons was a great place to go.They were super friendly and welcoming, and they knew so much about insurance.You need to print out a voucher before you go there, but they did the exam and glasses fitting and will take our voucher when we get it in the mail.Dr. Handwritten was a great doctor.He was great at explaining what he was doing, and just chatting about your day, and making you feel comfortable.Totally pain-free exam.They have a great selection of glasses to choose from even the free ones had some decent ones to choose from.We had a great experience and will definitely go back.< /Review><name>Yun Engle</name><response>None< /response>< userid>

If I could give them less stars I would. I have gone to them for months complaining about my vision in my left eye. Each time they say it is because my contacts were just not fitting. I kept telling them I did not think that was it because my right eye was fine. They tried to sell me contacts that were $150 every three months. I went to a specialist in under 20 minutes found I had severe cataracts and LensCrafters should have seen this from all the test they did on my eye. If you want to see go to professionals. The cost is the same and the results will be much better!</Review>

The doctor provided me a prescription with an axis that was wrong and double my previous prescriptions.  I had glasses made somewhere else based off their prescription and it has been a complete waste of money and time.<//Text>

Not even close to satisfactory service from there I doctors. The actual exam took about two minutes, the doctor working with me went so fast I left with zero confidence that the prescription that she gave me was worth the paper it was written on.

I was only given one pair of contacts to try on, after which she was ready to call it a day. I insisted on trying another pair, One that gave me double vision in one eye. She was still ready to call it a day so I insisted on trying another pair but after that pretty much gave up and figured that I will just go see another doctor.

This office is in her own words "hey, that's good enough".

I don't want good enough, I want perfect or at the very least an honest and thorough attempt to that end.

Go somewhere else, anywhere else, the service seriously can't get worse.< /text>

Granted I came in with no appointment he didn't honor his price with out appointment which was 5 dollars less I believe but worst of all he diced me up like a vegetable. Like I said I came in with out appointment but he should of just told me he wasn't gonna have time. When he was done he didn't hold the mirror for me to check out my hair cause he knew he had cut me up pretty bad. I honestly didn't notice till I got home and touched my neck ans worst of all I tipped him an extra 10 bucks. Never going back wish I could get my money back.< /review>

Visiting from out of town, walked in with no appointment, I waited. Took 30-45 minutes to wait.  Well worth it.  Best cut and beard trim I have had in a while.  Those complaining about the service need to realize it’s a barber shop, not a salon.  Highly recommend it.</review>

Great atmosphere, all of the barbers appeared to be great barbers. I waited a little bit cause I didn't have an appointment so I got to see each one of them cut hair. Every barber there was a perfectionist and took their time with every cut/line. It is definitely recommended to make an appointment with anyone. All the barbers are really good so they all have appointments.

I got my haircut by Willie he's the first chair when you walk in.  He was very polite and a very good barber for someone who just got started. He asked a lot of questions just to make sure I had my hair the way I wanted it.

I also want to mention that these guys still cut my hair even though I was there until after the store closed. They have never seen me because I'm not from around here I just chose this barbershop cause it had great reviews. Some places aren't so welcoming to newcomers and usually don't care for newcomers.

I highly recommend this shop to anyone who is in the area looking for a good cut. I paid the regular price $15. If I could give this place 10 stars I would.< /review>

Wonderful place! I moved to this area so was on the search for a new barber shop and randomly stumbled upon this place! Had no apmnt but they generously greeted me and took care of me upon asap!  Willi took care of my hair cut and did a really good job! He was very accommodating and helpful to ensure I had exactly what I want! Great place! Highly recommend<//text>

This barber shop is all about perfection and customer satisfaction. All barbers are very skilled. My son is mixed with African American so his hair is a bit tricky to cut and style. This place knows exactly what to do when it comes to any type of hair texture. It is always busy because they do an excellent job; however the owner always makes a way to squeeze in all walk-ins. The barbers take their time with each person and that is why we faithfully go to this barber shop time and time again. Great cuts - for a kids cut we have paid between $10-15 bucks including tip.< /review>

By outside appearance, you might write this place off as some shady hole in the wall, or not even notice it, but that is very deceiving.  The inside is very clean with a masculine, modern style to it and just a tiny hint of 20s vintage.

The location is a reflection of the staff as well.  At first glance you might be temped to write them off as one thing or another, but regardless of what you may take from appearance, they are true professional barbers.  They won't fawn over you, but they are very friendly, welcoming, and able to give you whatever kind of cut you're looking for(and help you find out what that is in my case), all at a good price and a timely manner.

If you're looking for something other than the hospital waiting rooms of more commercial barbers, at a quality and price that beats them. I highly recommend you stop by.< /review>

I email my recipes and they mill and package. I stop by to pick up the order. Very nice. One customer at a time in the store. Excellent customer service. Good selection of grain hops and yeast listed on the website. Co2 refills. Covid safe.</Text>

This is a really great, well-stocked homebrewing store in North County. I've been in three times now, and they always have what I need instead of having to wait for somewhere else to mail me an order. They're really friendly and knowledgeable and want to support you in your brewing. I can't recommend this awesome local supply store enough!<//review>

I went to Carlsbad Brew Supply in order to exchange a CO2 cylinder. The shop is nestled in a nondescript Business Park, on the back side of one of the buildings. The shop requires that a ring a doorbell to get assistance. I appreciate that they take care to protect themselves and their customers during this time of covid-19 . The process of exchanging the cylinders was fast and easy and very reasonably priced. I will definitely return</text>

Lisa and Raul have been very helpful in getting me going with my first home brew setup. They’re welcoming, knowledgeable, and have a great selection of brew supply and ingredients. They’re taking COVID safety precautions serious. I highly recommend them! Thanks!<//review>

Super helpful and friendly! Very knowledgeable husband and wife partnership. Large selection of beer brewing supplies.

Father’s Day 2019, the owner Raul, spent over an hour helping me gather supplies for one of his in-house brew recipes, and answered all my newbie questions with patience. I can’t say enough about how great and welcoming this place is. Raul and his wife have a true passion for brewing and the brewing community. I won’t go anywhere else for my home brew needs. Thank you!<//text>

Staff is very friendly and knowledgeable. Great place to ask questions if you are new to brewing or to swap secrets if you are experienced. The only downside is they are a little hard to find in that commercial park if you have never been there before.</Review>

The location of this RV park can't be beat! We spent the month of November here and loved the walk along the cliff each morning. We had a great time riding the Skunk Train rail bikes, enjoyed the easy and peaceful fall hiking in the Mendocino Coast botanical gardens and taking our dogs to the Noyo beach off leash dog beach. All convenient to the park!<//Text>

We stayed here for 2 nights of our journey from So Cal to Oregon.  We had a nice stay, enjoyed the trail along the bluffs and the dogs enjoyed it as well.  The views from the bluffs was beautiful!  We visited the dog beach across the river on our way out and it was great!< /text>

Hope you'll be stopping here again sometime soon.  -Natalee F., Owner"}< /Response><Text>Our favorite park in Fort Bragg! We love Carolyn and the crew. Great ocean views. Busy in the summer, very relaxed during winter months. Nice trail nearby to walk your dogs or enjoy the coastline and sunset. Highly recommend. Very clean bathrooms.

Adjoins a small, very clean mobile home park. Close to down town. Walking distance to beaches, if you're up for it. Cable. Wifi a bit spotty.

Very reasonable prices, electric and water/sewage included. Other parks in the area charge extra. Quiet. Great spot!

Only complaints- tics go crazy there so check your dogs after walking them.<//Text>< Name>

<Text>Great to be able to take our dogs. Great for walking trails along the ocean. Very relaxing and peaceful. The fog horn every 30 seconds and road noise, got used to it quickly.< /Text>< Pics>

The dump station no longer works and the manager indicated that they were not fixing it anytime soon due to cost.  She did indicate that there is a dump station just down the road that charges $5.
There is a fog horn that goes off every 30 seconds all day and all night! This of course is not the parks fault but I thought it should be mentioned.
There is a cool walking path right outside of the park that goes all around the bluffs, which is dog friendly!< /review><pictures>None</pictures><response>{'time': 1583259607064, 'text': "While it's wonderful you enjoyed a nice walk with your best friend around the area, we certainly want to ensure that everyone enjoys a perfect stay at our place, Tracy.

Staff is awesome and willing to bend over backwards to make sure you get what you need. Easy access ... although Highway 20 is a white knuckle geipper. Good seafood. Decent level spots. Fun.<//Review>

Nice views can get very foggy on some days usually the inland is nice and coast is slight chill,or nice. When inland,is cold the coast be the,most beautiful,place. Be sure to,check,your weather before traveling,to,these,rural areas. Can't,go wrong,in any area near this place.</Text>

We have been here many times always love the view. Now they have new management and have made some nice changes. They have upgraded the pads and the electrical posts. The lady who manages it is very very sweet. Fantastic views of the ocean from the bluff of Fort Bragg.</Text>

Stayed here 2 nights in October, near the back overlooking the fields, the water and fun walkway. Loved the big surf, the cliffs and foghorns. Light in the back corner very much too bright! Restrooms clean, park is dog friendly but there were burs that stuck in my dog's hair. Many trailers and 5th wheels. The back of the park was great for my Class B. Gorgeous sunset. Harbor below. Could at times be overcrowded.< /review>

Pretty bare bones. It had everything you'd need, nothing more. I didn't check out the bathrooms... but, I also didn't notice them for a few days. They're crammed between permanent residents' homes.
Wifi was ok. Not great.
The cliffside was really cool.

Glass beach was lame. Don't waste your time.
If you have kids, the park in the middle of town is awesome.<//text>

I also apologize about the wind; you are absolutely right, being perched atop the bluffs exposes us to extreme ocean weather.

The sites were unlevel and muddy. There is a very annoying horn in the harbor that sounds every 20 seconds or so, day and night, it gets annoying. It's very windy right there on the bluffs, makes it hard to have your awning out. I would say it is very overpriced for what you get. Probably the best location in fort Bragg tho as far a being close to amenities. Bathrooms were clean. 2stars because of the muddy lot and price. Internet was also not good.<//text>

<text>Stayed there last July 4th -- the #1 BEST place to watch fireworks, period!  Just mosey out to the bluff and not only do you have an unobstructed view of the entire flight of the fireworks, the effect is DDOOUUBBLLEEDD because the lights reflect off the water that's between you and them -- wow!

I guess they had some electrical problems, so they're only renting out those spots they know to be Ok.  Sharon, the owner, has been wonderful to us in making reservations (in phone and in person), then she moved us to the BEST spots in the place!

Looking forward to this weekend -- my favorite weekend of the year in Fort Bragg!  :)</text><time>1498420387796<//time>< gmapID>

<Text>It was always a great place to shop. I love this brand it was cool styles and good quality. It feels much more like a boutique and was very inviting. They were having a big sale and I almost bought a couple things but just couldn't decide.  The staff was pretty friendly and helpful and helped me get the best deal with her purchase.  Couldn't ask for more. Great service.<//Text>< Date>

Pretty terrible experience. Very limited styles and sizes, walked the store two or three times and was not greeted or helped. The two girls working were having a full conversation with each other at the cashwrap. Grabbed what I needed and went to try on, man working the back half was too busy re- merchandising to help me. A gentleman that was trying on had to keep coming back out onto the floor to grab his own sizes from the fitting rooms. Walked into fitts after waiting about five minutes, every single room was piled with merchandise that hadn’t been put away. The carpeting in the rooms looked like it hadn’t been vacuumed in forever, tons of tags and plastic and strings all over the ground. Tried on my items, finished up and walked back out to the sales floor. The girls stopped their conversation for 2.5 seconds to look at me, not say anything and then go back to talking. I left. Won’t be returning zero customer engagement or experience. Asking for LP problems< /review>

This Gap was on the smaller side but I really liked that. It feels much more like a boutique and was very inviting. They were having a big sale and I almost bought a couple things but just couldn't decide.  The staff was pretty friendly and helpful and helped my mom get the best deal with her purchase.

Staff here is great. Store is neat, organized, and well lit - very pleasant. Gap clothes are at every Gap - the difference is the staff.< /text>

Store was real nice and organized, staff was somewhat pleasant. However, the real young girl sitting at register was quite rude to me and my wife. She kept trying to pressure me into getting a gap credit card a million times even after telling her I’m not interested. Once I finally convinced her I didn’t want it she did this ugh ok fine remark that was super snobby. I’m not sure if she was in a bad mood or what but once we finally finished paying I told her thanks and have a good Xmas and all she said was ya ya bye... not the type of employee that should be in retail if you ask me or just not hire young immature kids in highschool.<//text>

Its kind of crammed in some spots inside, but they work with the space they have. Staff here is friendly and helpful too (as with most Gap stores in the area)<//Review>

<text>I would never ever visit Gap burlingame store again. I live here and I used to shop at this location all the time. Today I was helping by a short hair with grey and black short hair lady wearing glasses. I didn't get anything because the size not fit. When I'm asking about more sizes, this lady showed her very cold face and said no. When I'm about leaving,  she told her co worker that I could've got it in Chinatown, it's cheaper and have more sizeS. This is so rude!!! She was not very nice in the beginning. This bad experience made me feel so terrible.this shouldn't happened. I will tell all my friends not shop there.</text>< UserId.>

<Text>Not a place for small dogs. Today the big dogs took over. One aggressive Great Dane the size of a pony sent the little dog owners home. Woodward Park is too far and they have a cover charge. Hamilton Middle School doesn't allow dogs during soccer practice on weekends. Fresno is not a city known for dog parks. The basin is no fun for small dogs. My girls wanted to GTHO after one walk around.</Text><user>109361311371301761414<//user><Rate>1< /Rate><Gmap_id>0x8094661b26c5e119:0x718c35d4ada80916<//Gmap_id>< Resp>

<Rate>4< /Rate><review>Nice little Park from a ponding basin. Access has been cut back to 7 pm for All Dog Parks. Normally 10pm.

Is it Safer before 7pm. The pool, water buckets & hose were removed. This is a hazard for the animals during July heat.
Dogs are not supposed to play?

I wasn't aware of the Canine Covid.< /review>< Time>

Nice size dog park, all types of breeds go to hang out here. Owners are good about keeping their dogs in control...chairs and water are out there for everyone's use and the times we've visited it's always kept clean!<//review>

<Rate>5</Rate><review>Nice, open area. There are chairs in the park so you can rest while your fur baby exercises. It would be nice if every dog parent were responsible though.
If you have a dog, and they do their business, you have to clean it up. If you don't, you have no business having an animal. Makes me wonder if you're neglectful to them in other ways too.<//review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

It's awesome to have a dog park, but I wish they would have a section for the small dogs separate from the big dogs. Because I'm scared that they might do something to do small dogs. But it is much appreciated to have it. Thank you< /review>

Not as great in looks, but open and spacious. Offers a water hose, so that was nice. However, first time coming here, and within my first 15minutes of being here, some lady's dog came over and one second was sniffing the ground where my dog peed and the next lifted its leg and peed on me. I was so mad. The pee would have easily went higher (to my knee, maybe thigh), but in the time of warning that dog gave me, with my excellent reaction time, the dog managed to get my whole calf and shin covered in urine. Then walked in a circle around me and peed on my bag of toys. I had hoped people would have better trained dogs if they come to the park, but there's me for thinking people care as much about training their dog as they do their phone. There should be a ban on owners bringing dogs that aren't trained to a certain degree.<//Review>

They've cut the hours down to sunrise until sunset,  with the temperatures we're experiencing nobody in their right mind sets foot, face wrapped in mask, dogs unable to drink or otherwise cool themselves.

My dog passed out from overheating twice. Might as well not be there. Used to be open until 10pm to allow for a visit when it's cooler at least.

Dunno which idiot is in charge but either they don't care or they simply don't want to open and close the park, ie do their job.</text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

The park itself is really nice, I'd give 5⭐, I've been coming here for years. But lately there's been a lot more intact male dogs that come to the park and cause issues. I come 3 times a week and every single time there is a dog fight that involves an intact male dog, there is quite a few of them that are aggressive. This place is no longer safe, I'm not gonna come here again unless intact dogs are not allowed in this park.</Text>

< Review>
The park itself is really nice, I'd give 5⭐, I've been coming here for years. But lately there's been a lot more intact male dogs that come to the park and cause issues. I come 3 times a week and every single time there is a dog fight that involves an intact male dog, there is quite a few of them that are aggressive. This place is no longer safe, I'm not gonna come here again unless intact dogs are not allowed in this park.</Review>

<Text>I quickly stopped here to let my dog out to relieve herself and let her play for a bit. It's a large park with plenty of trees and grass all around. The park isn't divided which I don't mind since my dog gets a long with both large and small dogs. The dogs that were there played well with one and another. I didn't see any dog bags dispenser</Text>< Pictures>

I just became a regular and I love it! The dogs seem to be regulars and so far I haven’t had really worry about aggressive dogs. I can watch my dog from a distance without having to worry and hover over her. Love it!< /Review>

<Text>Good place for big/medium sized dogs, with lots of open space. Unfortunately, there's no small dog areas and the dogs were fairly aggressive towards our small breed dog. It was an okay experience at best.< /Text>< Response>

<Review>We live in an apartment complex nearby and really needed a place for our Golden Retriever to romp, play, and socialize with other dogs and people. We love this park. It's quite large and open with lots of space to run and play. The people have all been very friendly, respectful, and responsible when it comes to their dogs acting out or aggressively. The park is free of trash and people are very good about cleaning up after their animals. If you live nearby and need a place for your dog to socialize and play, you should definitely come out and make some new friends for you and your dog.</Review>< Pictures>

We love going to this dog park. The people are friendly, the dogs are nice (usually), and most dog parents take care of problems as soon as they arise. The only cons to this place is that it has been closed this weekend and the last weekend with no notice or explanation. Also, people need to clean up after their dogs more (most people do, but there are still many piles of Pooh laying around).
Overall, this place is great and our pups love to go play! Best (free) dog park in Fresno by far!</Review>

The space was good, plenty of seating and scooper tools. I just had one issue with the lights turning on nearly an hour after dark, we had to use our phone flashlights. Thank you though, I'll be sure to come back some time!<//review>

Pretty nice park,  apparently students from Fresno State maintained and oversee the park and I got to meet one of them and she was very nice. My dog did get into a fight with another dog which is extremely unusual because I have two other dogs at home that are more aggressive than the dog I took to the park and she is never gotten into a fight so I was a little shocked and didn't know what to do but the other people that were there were really really helpful and understanding so overall good experience</text>

<review>My dogs love this park. If I do not take them at least once a week they throw fits and decide not to fully listen to me. It is a really nice park. Of course you will find some dogs that are mean and vicious but thats when you be a good dog owner and protect your animals. Most dog owners are good at keeping their dogs in line. Yes you must pick up the poop.. ALL OF IT that your dog or dogs do and you must keep your dog in line. If you can do that by all means check out the park and you will enjoy it.</review>< Pics>

been going here for a little over a year, the park is huge, dog owners are friendly, the place is maintained & clean, rakes & scoopers are provided to clean up after your dog, there is running water & a few kiddie pools, tall shade trees, wheelchair access down into the park but wish there was a path all the way around, dogs of all sizes play together,<//Review>

I have been coming here since 1999. My  dogs get all of their annual shots. If you don't know what shots your dog needs and your vet doesn't know then maybe you should change vets. Some self important vets and county workers seem to want to shut down this park, they are IDIOTS.  It's a very good place to go great people, great dogs, good times<//text>

My favorite dog park. I have a happy pitbull and people usually are unwelcoming due to his breed, but at this dog park, everybody is accepting and friendly. The park is huge. There are plenty of shovels for poo. It's the best dog park around.< /review>

My little dog was nervous about the big dogs there but the people there took good care of their dogs kept them under control and we're very polite and nice to talk to.
There's plenty of water for the dogs there are big bowls of it and there's places where you can get rid of the p..py once you have picked it up.
All in all it's a really nice place to visit.<//Review>

My 21 pound Pug/Jack Russell cross was attacked by a grey huskie that is at this park frequently in the mornings.It had my dog pinned to the ground aggressively biting the neck and chest area. My dog is non aggressive. I found out that this dog has a history of problems with small dogs...I think that the owner is very irresponsible for not warning me of this!! Did not even bother to ask if my dog was alright!! Must be the "norm" for her...I have never had a small dog before will carry pepper spray and shocker flashlight to protect my dog. Oh by the way my dog walked away okay she did better than I did....park is great been coming here close to 20 years now!!!<//Review>

<review>Nice big gated dog park. Seats for the humans and plenty of shade! Our dogs loved to run arround and play together and make new friends. I really liked that there was a tool to pick up after your dog so we didnt have to use our doggie bags! Definately recomend this park if you have dogs that need a fenced in area to play.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

Its small and essentially just a field but they put out little pools for the pups. Its definitely secure with fencing all around and its kind of hidden but that makes it a great place, pups can just focus on meeting other pups and having fun< /text>

We were greeted at the gate by a beautiful Husky. Very animated and had hard time getting in gate because the Husky was jumping up against the gate and barking agressivly. I looked to the Huskies owner who was about 75 yards away sitting in a chair flipping through a magazine didn't even look up. This is not the rule but rather the exception. Why there are signes saying dogs on leash. Please people pay attention and respect others who are sharing a facility.< /Text>

I have been going to this dog park for approximately 14 days. It is relatively good park, but there are some dog owners whose dog should not be allowed.  They are always hurting other dogs, and they do not act to stop their dogs actions. It is unacceptable behavior and a serious risk to others.</text>

It was my first time taking my puppy. She was doing well until a family brought 5 of their large huskies, untrained, who then barreled into my puppy who, understandably, wanted nothing to do with them and began growling when they got into her face. So we left. The family was not supervising their dogs. Aside from that, there's plenty of shade places to sit.< /Review>

<Text>Amazing park overall, one of the better ones in Fresno area if your looking for an open, clean, and friendly park. Dogs and owners their are great for the most part, have had a couple incidents, but my 1 year old pit mix absolutely loves this park and running around with all the other dogs. I feel the biggest issue within this park is IGNORANCE on behalf of some of the dog owners. There is a group of ladies that come in the morning with herds of dogs. Of the incidents my boy has had at this park, majority have involved some dog they brought that day. Funny thing is each time something happens and I calm my dog or remove him from the situation they say, "Is this his first time here?" Like they don't remember me, haha I don't like to be rude but I've worked with horses for a couple years and some dog trainers and groomers as well, so i know a fair bit about how to handle an animal. Im no dog expert but i learned a lot from horses and the people i was working with taught me a lot in my time there, so i know this park has an issue with ignorance because there is A LOT of people that come to this dog park and don't realize how to handle a dog, that their dog might very well be the problem, or even how to remove a dog from a tense situation. And overall my boy and me absolutely love this park, its got actual grass EVERYWHERE, some dirt patches, no bark, I've taken my boy to a fair share of parks and this one is towards the top of the list until the owners start interfering. The hardest thing to deal with at this park for me is the the sheer lack of knowledge of how to let a dog be a dog. Don't come to a dog park expecting the dogs to prance side by side the whole time while you walk around, they may get a little rough playing with each other, that does not mean their going to bite each others throats out. O and if you have any type of pitbull, come to this park and be prepared to be looked at a different way. Its the most horrendous, unjust, ignorant, and just flat out rude thing to do, and i wish some people could be educated, but its just impossible i feel. :/< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None< /response>< gmapID>

There are trash cans and pooper scoopers for cleaning up after dogs. There are plastic chairs and kiddie pools so the dogs can cool off. It can be crowded, especially at 10am, but the dogs are friendly and playful. Parking can be hard to find as there is no parking lot.</Text>< pics>

Huge field, drinking water for pups, pool to play, balls, poop scoopers, chairs etc.  Great quite area for the dogs.  But.  Beware.  There are a few judgemental a$$es that get all bent out of shape if your dog isn't neutered. And could care less if their dogs hump yours.  And will basically say it's your fault bc they are young and not fixed.  "They, " are a couple of women that have a huge amount of dogs - either dog walkers or rescue type. But beware their attitudes.  Can make you pissy real quick.< /Text>

<name>Lo<//name><text>I wouldn't recommending anyone take their dogs here. Mine contracted Gerardia (or however your spell it) which is a bacteria that lives in the soil or stagnant water that  causes severe diarrhea and is contagious. Considering its a water basen, the bacteria is consistently present. The vet told us to immediately clean up their waste and spray the grass with bleach water. (So tedious) After spending $200 + dollars at the vet and not knowing the dog park was where they got it, we went back 2 weeks later. The next day they showed the same symptoms. After treating them for a second time, we never went back and to this day they have not had any infections.< /text>< rating>

<Text>Love Yardhouse. Great place to get a half yard of beer after a long work day. The outdoor seating works great with all the heaters when it's cold out and service is very quick. The poke nachos are so GOOD.  Definitely a must try item whether you're alone or with a group of friends and want to share. They have a great selection of alcohol and other main courses. A kids menu is also included if you have little ones.<//Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOjrcnlkLDBz0zzYmvbz52lG_hmqGfKY9J68dIK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics><Resp>None</Resp><Gmap_id>0x80d95518686323db:0x2f013d9246d12b62</Gmap_id></record>

A great experience! We picked our seats outside. The selection of beer is pretty good.  Our waitress was awesome, I wish I would've remembered her name! I got the calamari, chicken tortilla soup( pictured) and poke nachos.< /Text>

<Text>Two words: Happy Hour. The poke nachos are fantastic, and most apps are half off. Conveniently located next to AMC, so it makes the perfect date night combo. Service is always excellent. I’ve probably eaten here thirty times and only once has my food ever come out average. Highly recommend, it’s even worth trying to find mall parking on a busy afternoon.<//Text>< time>

Stopped by the Yard House for lunch this day which is located in Westfield mall. First I ordered two tacos, one being the blacked white fish with crema, mango and cabbage, as well as their Korean BBQ short rib taco with green papaya and jicama.  The blackened white fish was really good, with plenty of spice to be satisfying.  Their chicken tortilla soup kept calling out to me before and after the tacos so I ended up ordering it after.  It was rich and creamy, almost like the filling in a pot pie.  The cup is a reasonable size so I left pretty satisfied without feeling stuffed.  Their salad and soup selection looked great so I might be back to try more salad options.< /text>

I love this place, I'm a vegetarian and they have UUUHHMMAAZING vegetarian/vegan options, my favorite being the Gardein buffalo wings! So good, always a wise variety of beers on tap, TVs, luxurious feeling with a huge menu. People of all tastes should be able to find something here!</text>

I love this place so much!! This is one of the few places where I can find  my delicious Belgium beer landsmen froumboua.  And the menu is humongous! The food menu is 6 pages and you can find many things like appetizers entrees salad desserts, meat, seafood. If you don't know what to eat this is the place as you will find anything to satisfy you. Great for groups and watch sports<//Text>

<review>Sorry but I was not impressed...lobster noodles were hard...macaroni and cheese was dry and bland...filet had grizzle running through the middle of it and it's vegetables were raw...even my bloody mary was lacking....the best thing was the salad, the edemame, the mashed potatoes and the brookie. I think you guys need to step it up a notch...these are just my comments on my food, I was there with a party of 12 and everybody was disappointed with something.</review>< Pics>

< Review>
We had a great experience at Yard House. Our waiter was amazing, the food was delicious and the atmosphere was really nice. My husband had the Nashville hot chicken sandwich which I tried and it was so good and had a nice heat to it. I had a pork burger with a blueberry ketchup which sounds so weird but was absolutely amazing and almost tasted like a BBQ sauce. My daughter had the vampire quesadilla and I also tried hers and I highly recommend it!! I thought it was even better than my own food. The appetizer we had was the lobster crab artichoke dip which was also so good!< /Review>

I love this place so much!!
This is one of the few places where I can find  my delicious Belgium beer landsmen froumboua.
And the menu is humongous! The food menu is 6 pages and you can find many things like appetizers entrees salad desserts, meat, seafood.
If you don't know what to eat this is the place as you will find anything to satisfy you.
Great for groups and watch sports<//Review>

<Rating>5</Rating><Review>This place is a blast! Their lamb burger was outstanding and their garlic fries were tasty! Our server was so nice, and she got our food out pretty quick. You honestly can't beat their happy hour. We spilt a burger, fried calamari,  and a plate of garlic fries, plus 2 beers for $42. I think this place will probably be our  go-to from now on.< /Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM49_f_IgXidIMqEuGUjQSnMbE4OeTDKcDc8NMF=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMkXz6eQr6Fm4bwkqHZYmFUtzhOvHmPPvmexNLS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures>< resp>

So, I kind of forgot to take the photos right away. But that is how good the food looked upon arrival to the table. The service at this Yardhouse is impressive, the food is amazing and the atmosphere is one to remember. Definitely hit this place on your journey!</text>

So good!!

A little near the expensive side but everything on our table was great. Every meal is between 14-20 on average not including things like steak.

Nice drink selection and TVs everywhere so it’s a good sports bar vibe just leveled up food.</text>

<review>The wait was not that long to get seated but our waiter must have been new or busy as hell.  He kept walking off before completely getting my order.  He got my order wrong.  The service is why they received 3 stars. The food presentation was very good.</review>< resp>

<Rating>4<//Rating><Review>Great environment, good for meetings. Good for lunch and dinner. Great beer selection. Good cocktails. Only downfall is small portion sizes that they give you options for lager sizes for more money but are still small. Great service though as well so overall a great place I look forward to frequenting in the future.< /Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMaykZUQy1imP4R9SztZul9OqTvavvTuUtgZOLK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMFDcddmUSQ81lIGZUfygshenrn-amMgg0IQBHa=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN1A63gUTUrdYHaaalK55mekofxDMYFn38y0NVS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN0EdihdQx8qK2msHVtF5QcN4CKr_EpTg9S_UC1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMlUkxvv4BXPsktVB5TeT-5wCFjmQFjDnNzPLbV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOOFolXkhF2bj7M0olVfDF6jD8Fn2N73Rv9TLxx=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPte6U3cs0YQL6Y9w-JiFHb7vLFlhvz50uI_SAQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOWoBynXYUlQKMLsJRflJGO9NZQpzjjebW9UCg2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOpIMvHGThZcjzxzILIY94jeaczNG8fTCtOWknl=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNxfjeijswNqwlOzhJxVTinDF0yqVbgrDf-4cho=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMg-zHPlQkrp97ZeDHGtFM_jq0LqXc5U_IhsLv8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures><Resp>None</Resp><gmap_id>0x80d95518686323db:0x2f013d9246d12b62</gmap_id></record>

<review>I really liked Yard House...it was our first time trying them and we were delighted.  The southern fried chicken was delicious,  the braised short rib ravioli was awesome, and the chicken nacho appetizer was soooo much good food. Their Happy Hour is awesome and worth a try! We will certainly be visiting the Yard House in our hometown.<//review>< pictures>

<Name>Hector< /Name><Review>Crunchy bacon a bit on the salty side but well cooked. Fries got cold a bit faster then usual making the taste and softness change. Three different choices of sauces from the start ketchup, aioli, mustard. The burger was juicy well cooked and soft meat. Cheese got cold faster then expected. Bread was well toasted but not so soft. Great selections of beer mix drinks and shots! Right next to the AMC making it a good spot to stop and drink and eat after or before a movie. AC air is refreshing as much as the non alcoholic drinks are.< /Review>< time>

This place is freaking amazing. The ribeye was great. The drinks were great and so was the service! Will definitely come back. Ordered the crab and lobster dip, which I enjoyed also.< /Review>

<Text>Even though is was extremely busy. Our table for 2 was about a 7 min wait. We asked for a both but ended up getting a high table. When seated I looked around and noticed that the booths sat 4 or more, so I was happy just to get a table so fast when it was so busy.  We ordered calamari which was delicious. Nice and crispy. My lobster garlic noodles were delicious as usual. I always want to try something else, but I end up ordering the lobster garlic noodles, so good.</Text><Time>1584586923155< /Time><pics>None</pics></record></dataset><record>

Stopped by Yard House and had the California roll. This alternative to the classic resembles a sushi stack and is so good it will knock your socks off. I literally licked the plate. The ambiance at this location is very classy. Staff is great!< /Review>

Our server Brittany was amazing! We had cheeses curds, poke nachos(wontons on the side), margherita pizza, pepperoni & pizza mushroom. Plenty for the 2 of us and dinner for our 15 yo. Happy hour is the best deal in town!< /Text>

I always have great service at this bar.  The bartender is quick getting my drink and lunch is served fast.

It has never been crowded during my lunches and there is usually seating still open at the bar during early happy hour.< /text><date>1517729934345<//date>< Pics>

I actually told the bartender the kind of beer I liked and if she could recommend something not commonly found in the store. She was on target with her selections! Thanks Raina! Did the same with the food and again I was not disappointed. I had the chicken breast. Wonderful. My buddy had the pizza and it was good, but rather ordinary.  Will definitely be back.< /review>< pictures>

Great service. If you are a beer aficionado, you will have over 100 from which to try. Our waiter was great in being able to hear someone's taste preferences and provided some recommendations. We had the seared tuna and cheese curds as apps which were very tasty. Our goal was for burgers and we were not disappointed. The patties were cooked to order for all 4 of us, full off flavor, and we were surprised to be so full after eating them. We've experienced Yard House in San Diego, and hope St. Louis Park's location is just as great. Definitely worth giving this place a try!!</text>

Decent food the case can get a little crowded here and there. It is pretty expensive for the quality of the food but it is usually good if there are sports games playing to get out there and be in there with the crowd. There can be a wait but its like that in all good places downtown.</review>

<rating>5< /rating><text>Great beer, and a plethora of choices! Moreover, the food is tasty and the prices are fair. My only complaint is getting good service is somewhat hard, but that could be to the volume of customers or not. At the end of the day I have never had a bad experience at yard house and I highly recommend going if you have not already been.<//text>< pics>

Best beer menu ever!!

We love the Yard House!! The music! The atmosphere! The rock n roll!! Awesome place!!

My family and I just love! The chicken wings are a must, buffalo or Korean Garlic!

They do have beer ducts all over the roof! Best place to try some local brews!

Great food, friendly staff, awesome music!!< /Review>

<Review>We ordered our food to go and were told it was going to take 15-20 minutes but ended up being 40 minutes. The person that gave us our food went through the bag and confirmed our order out loud which was correct and nice that we didnt have to check it ourselves, but I wish we had checked it because there was a side missing from one of our entrees. That was a bummer on top of the extended wait. On a positive note, I will say that their poke nachos were freakin amazing and will go back there just for that.</Review>< pictures>

<Review>Lovely place! We went yesterday to celebrate my dad’s bday and the lady (unfortunately i can’t remember her name) was very attentive and kind! Awesome ambiance. Fast service.
Delicious Shrimp appetizer, BBQ Bacon Burger, Coronas Beer, Dr. Pepper (lol), Calamari appetizer and we chose half and half out of the menu for a pizza and they didn’t mind, half pepperoni and the other pepperoni with mushrooms! Will definitely be back! Thanks Yard House for making my dad’s day perfect!
Oh and a Chocolate individual brownie like, thanks!<//Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPhywILXTPfiyCCcYuwqyzE8VI84AHGfXhLkUPl=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures><resp>None</resp>< GmapID>

PERFECT DESIGN FOR SPORTS. HUGE selection of beer.
Great menu with fantastic food. Travis the manager was super cool and accommodating while Matt delivered prompt attentive service.
Attention to Details?
You know how when you wash your hands and you feel you have to have the "secret handshake" to get the faucet to work? Not at this Yard House. It works perfectly. And the secret handshake does open the door to leave bathroom.
Fun time and great atmosphere.< /Review>< Pics>

Come here very often, a great experience and amazing location for dinner and a movie in the mall. Happy hour specials every weekday 4-6pm provide great deals on beer and appetizers. The chicken nachos are huge and delicious!</text>

Sever was great, nice atmosphere. The only complaint was our soup was cold when served to us. Had to wait a bit for them to make more. Good lunch special. Was more food than expected for half sandwich and soup.</Review>

The food is to really stretch on the to Die for part. Oh my gooooooodddddnnnnneeeeeessssssss.

YES IT IS THAT GOOD. I had the Ahi Sashimi and the Kona Longboard. Made compliments to the magnificent chef and he put a smile on my face for many years to come. Thank you for my Ahi Tuna Roll. Fascinating to my taste buds. It sends something through your body that releases endorphins. It's a wonderful way to describe HEAVEN IN YOUR MOUTH. DELICIOUS.....</Review>

Variety of good food options for any diet with both intimate seating and a huge bar with almost every beer you can imagine. Good choice for viewing sports with friendly staff and a clean environment. The only downside for me is the brunch, the crunchy potatoes look and taste burnt and the pork breakfast burger was horrible with all due respect. Conveniently located next the a movie theater which makes for a solid date night.</Review>

Good food, but an excellent selection of beers. I really enjoyed the Poke sushi. It's a gigantic Poke "cake", rather than traditional sushi rolls. Atmosphere is nice as well.<//Text>

Im not that big on chain restaurants, but I love this place. Happy hour is the cats meow. Service is always on point even when it's packed. Amazing vegan/ vegetarian options. Might have to wait for a table during peak hours or get in where you fit in and sit at the bar.<//Review>

My wife took me here after she got a gift card from work. The hostess and both our waitresses were friendly and attentive. I had the bacon cheeseburger while my wife had some kind of chicken sandwich. My wife's sandwich was "okay" according to her. We both had a helping of fries that could only be described as miserly so thanks for helping with my figure I guess. My burger was cooked precisely to rare which is actually how I like it (medium rare requested) but they failed to let it rest so it arrived at the table sopping with juices and strangely lukewarm. Further the house spread for the bun completely overpowered every other taste in the burger. If you can't taste the cheddar on the burger you have a problem. Honestly I hold the manager responsible. He or she is clearly unqualified. I'm embarrassed for whoever let such a sloppy excuse for an American classic exit their kitchen.<//review>

<Text>Food is spectacular! And prices are decentm service is always great and the atmosphere is cozy and relaxed. They have a large selection of draft beers as well as Sunday bottomless mimosas and bloody Mary's!! Great place for a night out or a lunch with the family.

<time>1590039656858<//time><Review>Was sad to hear the Yard House closed their downtown location - it used to be a go to after work. Anyway, was looking for a way to escape the heat one weekend and decided to go to the AMC movies in Mission Valley mall. The Yard house is right next door - so popped in for their lunch special - under $10 - choice of sandwich or pizza with soup or salad. Great deal. I think it is daily.< /Review>< rating>

So good! Nice to see vegan stuff in the area.  The staff/owners are POC which is rad!  Had the mint and chop shake and it was amazing!  The cheese pocket things are delicious!  Haven't been able to try breakfast yet.  Hopefully soon!</review>

I always go to the Yard House during Happy Hour because they have one of the best. I'm not a big drinker, but half priced appetizers and pizzas will always keep me coming back for more. The Poke Nachos are my favorite and I still don't know how they pack so much flavor in them.  The pizzas are thin crust and the mozzarella cheese on the Margarita pizza is fresh, stringy when you pull it and delicious. The bar staff is quick to greet you, knowledgeable about the beers and the food, and super friendly.  I always recommend the one at Mission Valley and my wife and I stop there every time we go to the movies.  You will not be disappointed.< /review>

The downtown location was way better then this location. Had the fried calamari and it taste like it had freezer burn. Also service even sitting at the bar was extremely slow. I will not be going back to this location again.<//Review>

No wait to be seated on a Monday night, gotta love that. Service was good, price was fair, taste & quality of our food was also good. Do you see anything wrong with my picture? I could tell that the fries were carefully scattered around the plate to cover the area. I was disappointed in the lack of French fries, but I did not feel like complaining & looking petty to the server. I'll just leave my comment here for management. If you're going to be a high-end trendy restaurant, make sure you can afford the fries. I felt like they were just being cheap, trying to make the plate look full. But I'd be happy to go back & give them a chance to redeem themselves. Everything else was good. My sister had fries with her order too, and her serving was also skimpy, so it must be a poor portion size.< /text>

The food is excellent and the drinks even better.  I love to order the Mai Tai. It's a twist on the original Mai Tai but a very good twist. One of my favorite cocktails here. There is a wide selection of beers on tap for those looking for that option. Atmosphere here is always great.  Plenty of TVs at the bar if you are trying to catch the score of the game while at dinner. Movie are right next door.

Their server had great customer service. Nice bar/ restaurant vibe. Nachos are huge enough to feed up to 3 people, and burgers are bomb!<//review>

Went in for a late lunch, no wait time to be sat. Food and drinks were great, service was great. Only downside was that some popular items were missing from the menu due to covid.</Review>

Was getting a bit to eat after a movie. We were seated pretty quickly despite the line when we arrived. Server was attentive, I am usually better about getting the name, but she was terrific. Got the drinks, gave us time to review the menu. Gave us options on our entree. Food came out quickly. I had a Nashville chicken sandwich. It was the right amount of spicy. Everything went without issue. I will definitely  return< /review>

I normally don't like reviews unless I really had a bad experience. We were seated and greeted by our server and shortly after she took our orders she went on a break and passed us to her co-worker. You could tell he hated his job and didn't want to serve us since it wasn't his table. Food was cold, he brought us a wrong dressing and when I asked to get me the right one he took for ever and basically brought it to us when our food was finished. He was rude and not welcoming AT ALL. Management,  Next time this happens we will leave without paying for your poor service.</Review>

Our server was outstanding. Great personality, great food, and the restaurant itself was an amazing design and layout. Big room tables, a bar with wrap around beers in more  rand's that you thought existed. Went at lunch time and were seated right away. Had the BBQ chicken pizza and it was delicious. BBQ chicken salad was incredible. Great experience.< /text>

<text>Great food, drinks and service. We had large party kept adding more people but they accommodated us wonderfully even though they were very busy.

Love the fact that didn't have any issues with splitting check even for a large group. It is always a pain to figure out needs pay how much. They take order by guest nbr by default. All o had to say that I am Paying for me and friend.< /text><Rating>5</Rating>< userid>

They have so many options for vegetarians and pescatarians that you wouldnt expect from a chain. Their late night happy our is amazing, with half price appetizers and drink deals. My wife and I shared the ahi tuna salad,  clam chowder, fries and couldn't finish it all. We will continue to frequent this place... even though its located in the mall. Also love that it's open late... the kitchen too!</review>< time>

Came in a group formate. The service was quick , had some complications with other perfected dietary laws and substitute meal choices. The traditional buffalo wings I had were literally 11/10. I had them bring me some extra buffalo sauces I couldn’t feel my lips at the end of the meals but I sure went to town on them wings. The food is fairly expensive but I will say it’s worth it. Especially if you’re coming from out of town. Utah most definitely needs a location.<//text>

Another chain restaurant. But whoa - 5 stars. Yes, that's right! Here's why - great menu and lots of beer count for something. But they have excellent vegetarian and vegan options. They are not an afterthought and have different and tasty options. I had the Blackened Chicken sandwich. All the vegetarian options are from Gardein - one of the best makes of meatless meats! So kudos to a great restaurant with great options!<//review>

Yard house attracts a large crowd, seating for groups is good.  Famous for beer selection and diverse menu, including many vegetarian options in burgers and sandwiches, though not necessarily 'lite' eating.  Upbeat, lots of sports on screens to go along with the huge brewing adventure!<//Review>

<Review>Speechless. This was close  to a religious experience. The truffle fries plus the Nashville hot chicken sandwich is absolutely amazing. I have no clue what they put into this... but try it.
The rest of the menu looked great as well..had a really hard time to even settle on the chicken...really, really good. Will be back this week</Review>< pictures>

Really solid choice for a chain restaurant.
The burgers and truffle fries are VERY good, very filling. The "Vampire" street taco is unique...tasty and excellent! A tad pricey for pub/ale steakhouse is what has me giving this 4 instead of 5 stars. But definitely a SERIOUS recommend. 😊<//Text>

<user_id>103580996700381403698< /user_id><Pics>None<//Pics><text>What exceptional service! It was a busy Saturday night, however we didn't have to wait long for a table.  The staff was very attentive and aimed to please.  My husbands steak was more so on the well side and he wanted medium. The manager offered to bring out a new one and my husband said no thank you.  10 minutes later the manager comes out with a new steak cooked to perfection.  The way this staff strives too keep their customers satisfied is not only surprising but truly remarkable. We were celebrating my husband's birthday and didn't tell them because my husband isn't one for big displays. You would think that they knew because of the great service they provided. The food was delicious as well. I can't say enough about how great the staff is at the Mission Valley Yard House .< /text>< rating>

Overall, I had a great steak dinner. I ate the whole plate, and I think my companion came close. Good portions, we were starving after a concert.

Pros: Location, inside of an entertainment center in DTLA. The steak was delicious. Consistent good service. I think I agree gluten free.

The high tech touch screen has a menu. There's upcharges for games.

Unexpected: There's a bouncer carding everyone to get in. That threw me off.

Cons: they didn't have my first choice entree selection. I got my second choice, at $15 more. Although the waiter kinda apologized, there wasn't any offer to comp me. Corporate environment.<//review>

<Review>Good spot for friends and family meal, beer, and sports. Not nearly as crowded, at the time of this writing, as some other spots and plenty of parking nearby. The mall itself is kind of going downhill but Yard House seems to be doing well. If you want to watch a big game here I suggest getting here early and making sure you order food and drink. A half yard is a good way to go, it's about 2.5 pints.</Review>< name>

Celebrated my 30 birthday here on a visit from Texas. Food was excellent and drinks were well made. Dustin was our Waiter and he is a lot of fun to joke around with while still holding a professional manner. We will definitely go back when we return. A+ service and great food = great times. Thanks Yard House for making my day special!< /Review>

I have been to this Yard House location a few times.. I normally sit at the bar and Marlene is always awesome! Great service, very considerate and I appreciate how she goes above and beyond... I was craving the nachos but they are huge so I knew I would have to take a lot of them home. So she made a suggestion that saved me from having soggy chips later. That’ was really sweet and I am really grateful. So thank you Marlene! It really is the little things can make a persons day!< /Text>

The service was great. Food arrived pretty quick.
Love the quinoa salad with the salmon and the vegetarian options. The beers are great, huge selection.
My boy usually gets the hamburger and you can see the patty is homemade . In addition he has milk and egg allergies and they have options to accommodate his needs.
Its a perfect place to pass through  for a bite but also to.meet friends and hang out for a dinner together.< /review>

Stopped by for lunch, excellent selection of craft and micro brews. +$9.00 for a 23 oz beer that was poured short. +2 inches of foam... Kind of a rip off.

I had the fish tacos a la carte. Very tasty, lots of flavor 5 * on the tacos.

Service was good. Large TVs with sports on.

I'm surprised this place is still open. Mission Valley Mall had a ton of closed shops.<//review>

<text>The service was great. Food arrived pretty quick.
Love the quinoa salad with the salmon and the vegetarian options. The beers are great, huge selection.
My boy usually gets the hamburger and you can see the patty is homemade . In addition he has milk and egg allergies and they have options to accommodate his needs.
Its a perfect place to pass through  for a bite but also to.meet friends and hang out for a dinner together.</text></record>

<Text>Located directly next to the movie theater,  this is my favorite spot to grab a bite to eat and a drink either before or after taking in a movie. The main draw as with most Yard House restaurants is the the massive amount of beers on tap, so big it needs its own menu for itself.  The food is reasonably priced and covers the gambit from soups and salads to burgers and sandwiches to steak and chicken entrees.< /Text><gmapID>0x80d95518686323db:0x2f013d9246d12b62<//gmapID>< Response>

Good place for a younger, mature crowd. A nice place to eat for special occasions like birthdays or date night.

I had a Cali Cream (on nitro) that was fantastic and a avocado chicken sandwich which was to die for. Would go back in a heartbeat. Friendly service, but can be busy at times.<//Review>

I enjoyed the selections of beer. The service was spotty and not consistent as opposed to other customers. To be fair it was reverse HH and there basically trying to close, and no longer fully staffed.
Price $5 great per beer,  and they had half off appetizers.</review>

There were 4 in our party. We were seated right away.
Our food came out in a reasonable time. I ordered a French dip.  The au jus was cold as was the beef. Everyone else's good was fine.
I would have sent it back to be warned up, but our waitress was MIA.  We would have loved a second drink from the bar. Still no service. We finally asked for our check from another server.
Maybe just a bad night? The company was great and that is all that is important.< /Review>

They have an huge selection of beers, so if you’re looking for a variety, this is for you. We didn’t have much of their food, just their poke nachos which were yummy. I didn’t happen to see a happy hour menu or price, which accounts for the lack of one star. However, I would very much go again(:< /text>

<Review>Me and my 6 year old had to use the restroom on our way to Onomi's for Mother's Day, they were so nice and let us.
After they explained the menu items that were Vegetarian and other options. I will Definitely be eating there in the near future.</Review><date>1557793251038<//date>< username>

<review>This is a usual place to come visit. I like that they have a variety of drinks and food.
Our only concern was our food runner tried to squeeze our food in between my partner and I over both our shoulders. Felt weird that we had to move and grab our own food from between us.
Otherwise, we absolutely enjoy coming here.</review><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None</resp>< GmapID>

Before 6pm the place normally does not have a wait. When they get busy, they will "hold your spot" if you call and say you are on the way. The food and drinks are always superb and the waiters and waitresses are all nice. Bathrooms have always been clean when I have used them.< /text>

Absolutely dope place to grab a meal. Brooke at the bar is a total boss and she's super nice. Food was absolutely delicious. I had the onion rings, and bacon bbq burger it was delicious and juicy and filling. Would highly recommend.</text>

<text>Service: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Food: ⭐⭐⭐⭐
Prices/Value: ⭐⭐
Had a gift card, came to watch NFL Sunday. Mushroom and pepperoni pizza tasted good but the lumpia wasn't worth the price, and drinks were a bit pricey. Might come again if there was happy hour deals? Excellent service though, Dom and Tim were pleasant and attentive.</text>< pictures>

The food is descent (though nothing you can’t find better at other local establishments), and the servers excellent! Unfortunately, those factors alone are not enough to offset the changes that have made it impossible for us to enjoy the environment.<//text>< rating>

All good stuff, just get the sauces on the side. That way you get to decide how much salt and heat on the ahi. A good draft cider is the Ace Pineapple Cider.

<review>Waitress was wonderful, fast service. The salad I ordered was a mountain of salad and not much meat. They should ask how much dressing the customer likes pre mixed in. We were there just before late night happy hour started, and the waitress could've given us the less expensive happy hour menu. Regular prices are pretty high.</review><gmapID>0x80d95518686323db:0x2f013d9246d12b62< /gmapID>< Pics>

<review>This place is in the mall, so it took a bit to find it.. once inside I was pretty relaxed and pleased to see a very clean and open environment and a very quick bartender. I didn't actually try the beers but my friends seemed to enjoy them.  I really enjoyed the apps I ordered so would definitely go there again if I'm in the area.< /review><UserId.>100010447704304655690</UserId.><pics>None</pics><Response>None</Response></record></dataset><record>

Great location, fast and friendly staff. They have a wide variety of foods and beers, more than other similar chain restaurants. A bit on the pricey side for most of the entrees, not your everyday kind of place. Overall, it's an above average restaurant with an excellent customer service experience.</review>

Pomegranate margarita, chicken nachos,  and tower of onion rings is the best! Sour beer and half yard of pineapple beer are also worth ordering.  Take a night off and head to the Yard Hose.</text>

From salads to appetizers, steaks to pasta, this place rocks. Sit at a booth, table or at the bar you can enjoy your food whilst watching the sports channels. Though conversations can be difficult as there is not any sound dampening material to absorb the excess noise.</text>

This place is good but not amazing. I've been here often and I've got to say that quality has gone down. Customer service has always been great, but price comparison with food quality does not match up in my opinion.<//Review>

Food and service was great. Loved the roasted brussel sprouts and potatoes snack. And in the end had the large apple and peach cobbler with the creamiest, smoothest best darn caramel ice cream ever! Mmmm!</text>

<text>This place has almost everything !
The service in average is great, attentive, efficient and friendly.
The food is very good, fresh, quality meats and prices great during Happy Hour!
The ambiance is ok, a little noise during busy  hours.
The only thing needed is major control of the AC, especially the booths by the windows...
I always want to leave quickly because Im freezing ! 😬brrr...!!</text>< pictures>

<text>The food is always really great and theres usually a very short wait if there is one. The place sits alot of people. It's more of a sports bar than your expect which means it can get really loud sometimes. So if you are trying to watch a game and have a huge variety of beers this is the place. If you want a more quiet experience I'd suggest going during off seasons. The food can be a little pricey but the portions are worth it.</text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

As expected the draft beer selection was excellent. The food selection was also extensive and based on our selection the quality was really good. Also noted a how well our 6yr old son was looked after with their kids menu. We will certainly return.<//Review>

Well, this is my third time here this month, I love it. Great beer selection and very well prepared food.

Upd: I've dropped this one a notch for the tuna salad that seemed... stale. Maybe it's the lighting, but seared tuna with avocado and other green ingredients really didn't look appetizing, was more like a brownish mess. I've had the same dish several times before, the dish is great, but this time was weird, and I appreciate consistency.</Text>

A lot of the food is decent but most of it is overpriced. Service has also gotten slower since they've introduced the tablets at the tables.

Good place if you want to drop in for a beer and split some appetizers with a group of friends, but I wouldn't reccomend coming here for a full on meal.< /Review>

Went out to dinner here after spending the day at the beach.  Blown away by outstanding customer service. From the minute we walked in the door, hostess stated about a five minute wait and I think it was more like 3 minutes!  Our waitress came over-Hailey, talked with us told us all about the specials and all the beers, was just over the top fantastic!! There is no way I can express how impressed we were by Hailey and her attention to ALL of her customers, not just us! The food was outstanding, although they dropped one of our orders when it was coming out, they gave us a salad so we all had some food at the same time, and they took the salmon off the bill!!??!!??!  To the owner of this establishment-Give them all a raise and Hailey a huge bonus!!! Thank you Hailey for making this old man's birthday dinner over the top!!!!<//Text>

Food isn't great and also the service. You have to call the waiter again and again for specifics you mentioned first like ketchup, oregano, salt and peppers. Which they could have brought in one go it's really frustrating. Food also don't have much variation and veggies also taste dull.< /Review>

<text>If you're not picky on price and all you care about is good food/service, this place should get 8/5 stars. Our server was incredible - knowledgable about all food and beer, let my picky and indecisive gf try 4 different beers without batting an eye, made a custom drink for her, and was just wonderful to interact with. Wish i remembered his name.

Unfortunately many items on the menu seem overpriced. The beer you get in the half yard is more per ounce than the other sizes... c'mon guys<//text>< Date>

Disappointed. Portion size half if what is was a year ago. Vegetarian menu items, Gardein product line went from 20 items to 6 choices. Slow service even at 320 pm on a Sunday. Yard House was once my favorite restaurant.< /review>

<Text>Very disappointed, I order the Fried Chicken Breast, it was horrible... The chicken was so hard that even cutting into it was very difficult, left it all. Certainly not what one would expect of this level of restaurant. Will think twice before considering going again.< /Text>< GmapID>

< review>
Honestly this was probably the worst experience I've had a Yard House. The location was pretty empty and our server forgot about us. Appetizers took forever to come out and 1 of the 2 we ordered was forgotten about outright. When we asked our waitress about it, she seemed clueless. We received our food and it was mediocre at best. Though my Mac & Cheese squared, (described as Mac & Cheese on steroids) was pretty underwhelming. The pasta itself seemed very al dente.

The best part of the meal was the beer. The saving grace. The Julian Apple Pie cider was amazing. But it's not made by Yard Horse.

I would go back, but they had better step it up. Evening crew I'm talking about you.< /review>

<Resp>None< /Resp><review>We ve been instantly seated to a large comfortable booth with dim light, very nice atmosphere, the music was just at the right volume to be able to have a conversation,  eclectic and nothing disagreeable.
Our server was a ray of sunshine, she was everything you can expect from a server, joy, knowledge, smile, advise!
It was awesome to see that the staff works like a team, I think apart from our dedicated server, when she was busy elsewhere,  we probably saw 4 different staff members to bring us our food and drinks, check...
We had about an hour before our movie, we didnt say anything and made it in time.
Everything was perfectly cook and delicious.  We will definitely be back!!<//review><gmap_id>0x80d95518686323db:0x2f013d9246d12b62<//gmap_id><UserId.>116659116474043576743<//UserId.>< Rating>

<Review>OK, so if you like beer you can't go wrong at this place.
What we really like is the food.
They have a whole section of Gardein meat free options. Good place to take your vegetarian friends so they can join in on the fun! Lots of TVs and really powerful air conditioning!</Review></record>

I ordered the chicken and avocado sandwich with a small substitution.  I wanted a different cheese than what was on the sandwich but that didn't happen...no big deal.....the major issue was the chicken was way overdone.  I could tell it was precooked and had been sitting a warmer.   The only saving grace was the server Kendall.  She was very accomadating and friendly< /text>

<Text>I really enjoyed the ambience and service. We went in the evening and liked the dim "candle" lit scene. Our waiter was also really friendly and funny. However I felt the food we ordered wasn't good enough to justify the price.

We got the vodka shrimp pasta, Cuban roast pork sandwich, and seared ahí steak sandwich. They sound great on paper, but personally I think just tasted ok. Will have to try something different next time.

I also felt their menu needs to be updated/reworked. For example the vodka shrimp pasta is listed under seafood, but the plate is mainly composed of pasta. By that logic the seared ahí sandwich should also be listed under seafood, but its not. Not a major complaint, but it makes browsing their menu a little confusing.</Text>< gmap_id>

Great place to sit and have a beer. They have a good size bar with plenty of taps!  The wait for a table can get a little long Friday & Saturday nights but it is well worth it.  Great atmosphere!<//Text>

<text>Great service, great beer selection with GREAT labeling, and clean environment. 5/5 in that regards.
However, as a sit down restaurant, the food was well below mediocre.  The onion rings were 90% batter, the fries were cold, and the burger was bad enough to warrant not finishing.

If you're coming here for a meeting or group event, absolutely get some beers, but skip the food!<//text><pics>None< /pics><resp>None< /resp><gmapID>0x80d95518686323db:0x2f013d9246d12b62</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Beer had funky taste.  Tried three different beers; all had that same funky, bad taste.  Guessing it might be something in the hoses that connect kegs to spigot.< /Text>

Came here not sure what to expect. Friend of mine suggested a burger that had blueberry ketchup, and the blueberry beer. I was not disappointed!! Food is really good, service seemed a bit slow, but not long enough to make me feel annoyed or inpatient. I would eat here again.< /Text>

Bartenders complaining in front of guest & talking behind managers back or to the managers in front of the customer, unprofessional & makes me feel uncomfortable.

The food runners are more friendly than the bartenders, which is good & bad!

I will still come here cause I like the food & drinks but the bartenders behavior has gone down hill & it makes me feel very uncomfortable to sit at the bar!< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

<text>I asked about their pizza and to find out if the sausage was ground or chunky Italian. The server said ground and of course I believed him. Not ground, definitely chunky greasy sausage. The dish I was interested in before I read the details was  chicken fried rice. I know some vegetables are in it, but I guess it is a CA thing to have...spinach, asparagus, edamame, smoked tofu, shiitake mushrooms, green onions.... All in a chicken fried rice. Where's the avocado and kitchen sink....pulllease...</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

Great beer selection, consistently good service, and good food.  Yardhouse isn't my favorite establishment but this is a very good location.</text>

< review>
I asked about their pizza and to find out if the sausage was ground or chunky Italian. The server said ground and of course I believed him. Not ground, definitely chunky greasy sausage. The dish I was interested in before I read the details was  chicken fried rice. I know some vegetables are in it, but I guess it is a CA thing to have...spinach, asparagus, edamame, smoked tofu, shiitake mushrooms, green onions.... All in a chicken fried rice. Where's the avocado and kitchen sink....pulllease...< /review>

Lotsa beer to choose from. I tried a house blonde. Tasted old. No body to it at all. My daughter had a blackberry mojito and it was great. Just a few drinks. Good service. Just watch out for old beer. Stick with what you know!<//text>

< Review>
This was my first time at Yardhouse, and I went because I had some gift cards to this restaurant. I went on a Monday night, it wasn't packed, and we were seated right away. They had football playing on the tv, which is nice if you wanna catch the game and grab a bite. We just went on a whim, and lucked out on going during their happy hour. We got half off our appetizers, so we got two instead of one. The best thing was they have vegan/vegetarian friendly option. I got buffalo Gardein wings, which is mock chicken, and it was soo delicious! My bf even liked them, and he's a meat eater. They have a whole section of the menu based on Gardein options. I got the blackened Gardein chicken torta and upgraded to truffle fries. On top of the delicious food, staff was friendly, and made sure we knew all our options on the menu, since it was our first time there. Good place to go with friends with good food. And you can catch a movie after, since AMC is right next door.<//Review>

Big space. Nice friendly staff. Servers are prompt and helpful. The New York steak sandwich (cooked medium) was cooked perfectly and delicious. Truffle fries with malt vinegar - very tasty. I had a delicious sour called super silly sour. Happy Hour is from 10pm-12am mon-fri.<//Text>

Food is mediocre at best (at least the many different appetizers that we tried on a visit) their hot wings reminded me of microwable ones that come sauced already thumbs down for sure.
This is a great place to have some beers for me but for food not so much</Text>

Typical corporate owned facility. Nice to go here for happy hour but food and drinks are overpriced otherwise. Food is "ok". Think Chili's quality.<//Text>

The drinks were mediocre. When one of my friends ordered an item off there menu, they took the order but failed to inform her that the item she ordered was only seasonal and that they didn't have it until 10 minutes later. When my friend asked for the menu that we were given coming in, they gave her a different one cause again; they failed to inform us that the menus change after a certain time. The items on it were not appealing to any of us so we got up and left.< /review>

Wasnt busy at all for a Saturday night.
Our server was nice.
The food was a let down. The appetizer nachos were nasty. We barely ate any of it
I love yardhouse because I love the Shiitake garlic noodles.
The garlic noodles here were so bad.
I usually devour my noodles this time around I was forcing myself to eat them and even then I didnt even eat half of them.
I was disappointed big time. They were probably just having a bad night because on a good day the food is really good here<//Text>

I have been here a few times. Love the beer selection. Brought my wife and she loved the food. Never had aproblem at all ever. I know this is a new location from the downtown location but im assuming the people who gave bad reviews are just depressed negative people in general. This place is one of my favorites.  Recommended to all.<//Text>

<text>Management is rude.....

I was walking in to use the restroom from the patio and was 3ft away from the entrance and the two managers looked at me and just closed the door on me..

Very rude as management.

I've had many bad experiences with the management here and this might be the end of my visit to this location

<Review>I will never done there again. Your hostess was the most rude person I've delt with in a while. Came in at 4:50 asked for a high top by the bar. The girl with the short curly hair said no cause the 5 o'clock server was not there yet. I asked if I could buy a drink at the bar and then sit at the table and wait for the 5 o'clock server and she said no. I said I was fine buying a drink from the bar and waiting she said no. She asked if I wanted to wait cause it would be only 5 mins. I said yes went to the bar. At 5:12 I noticed people after me getting sat. I walked to the hostess and again asked if I could be sat as I saw people coming in after me being sat. She said she was about to seet me. I noticed a manager was at the hostess stand at the time so I repeated what she had told me earlier. She would seat me when the 5 o'clock server for that section was there . The very nice manager said just seat her. Your hostess rolled her eyes. Had I not had people from out of town on the way I would have walked out. She is beyond rude. I offered to get a drink at the bar and just asked to sit at the table I would be sat at then I guess the late server arrived. I had 4 people and there was no room at the bar for four people. She agian said no I can sit there cause she would get in trouble for letting me sit there with no server so I could wait or leave. I will never come here again.  She was awful. I kinda called her out in from of your new manager though she was much more friendly when he was there. We had planned on dinner there but said if she was that rude than we we would go elsewhere. We had our appetizers and left. I will not done here ever. And I will post this on Facebook and make sure my friends share. If you allow hostesses to treat customers like trash it's a down hill affect. People talk. And trust me I will. I've never been or felt as disrespected as I did today. Good luck with the hostess you had at 5. She cost you business. Not only mine but the people with me.< /Review>< username>

I will never done there again. Your hostess was the most rude person I've delt with in a while. Came in at 4:50 asked for a high top by the bar. The girl with the short curly hair said no cause the 5 o'clock server was not there yet. I asked if I could buy a drink at the bar and then sit at the table and wait for the 5 o'clock server and she said no. I said I was fine buying a drink from the bar and waiting she said no. She asked if I wanted to wait cause it would be only 5 mins. I said yes went to the bar. At 5:12 I noticed people after me getting sat. I walked to the hostess and again asked if I could be sat as I saw people coming in after me being sat. She said she was about to seet me. I noticed a manager was at the hostess stand at the time so I repeated what she had told me earlier. She would seat me when the 5 o'clock server for that section was there . The very nice manager said just seat her. Your hostess rolled her eyes. Had I not had people from out of town on the way I would have walked out. She is beyond rude. I offered to get a drink at the bar and just asked to sit at the table I would be sat at then I guess the late server arrived. I had 4 people and there was no room at the bar for four people. She agian said no I can sit there cause she would get in trouble for letting me sit there with no server so I could wait or leave. I will never come here again.  She was awful. I kinda called her out in from of your new manager though she was much more friendly when he was there. We had planned on dinner there but said if she was that rude than we we would go elsewhere. We had our appetizers and left. I will not done here ever. And I will post this on Facebook and make sure my friends share. If you allow hostesses to treat customers like trash it's a down hill affect. People talk. And trust me I will. I've never been or felt as disrespected as I did today. Good luck with the hostess you had at 5. She cost you business. Not only mine but the people with me.<//text>
