Food is good here, location is very clean. Not a whole lot of parking, and getting to location can be a bit of a pain. Staff were great, no complaints, slight difficulty talking to cashier, but was favorite part of location. Food prepared immediately, like done in less than 3 minutes. Only had a burrito, mild salsa was good. Definitely going to come back here eventually. Didn't see if had restrooms. In all, good food at an expected price.<//Review>

I love Roman's,  they have a huge selection of drinks at good prices. All their food is top notch. Go here instead of gas station for drinks!< /Review>

I don't get it. I came here because I was in the area, was wanting mexican, and the reviews were great. Did I get the off night? The food was not good and it was not a good value for what I got. I ordered a fish taco / enchilada combo and carne asada combo. I was looking forward to it too. The fish tacos are literally frozen fish sticks in a corn tortilla. I couldn't believe it. It was placed directly on the cheese enchilada in my combo which made the taco fall apart. The enchilada was just ok. The carne asada was basically burnt ground beef. Definitely not the asada I've had many many times in the past. The rice and beans was bland and under seasoned too. To top if all off there is an unannounced 4% service charge added. (I was a walk in customer...not delivery) so when I got the receipt after I paid, I saw that I paid an extra 4% on top of my gratuity bringing my total bill to nearly $40 for this meal. Sorry, that's not a good value at all...especially for what I got.< /Review>

Perhaps to better describe its excellent carne deshebrada to Orange County, "Roman's Mexican Restaurant and Taqueria" has followed Chipotle in naming it "beef barbacoa," even though barbacoa in Spanish translates to barbecue and, in Mexico, barbacoa traditionally refers to pit-roasted meats.

I am 100% sure the owner of Roman's is aware that carne deshebrada, aka Mexican-style shredded beef, is not barbacoa. Carne deshebrada is culinarily closer to being the Mexican equivalent to the Caribbean-style marinated, slow-cooked beef referred to as "ropa vieja."

Roman's "Carne Deshebrada Taco" aka "Barbacoa Taco," consists of two thin white corn tortillas filled with braised beef, dressed with fresh chopped onions and cilantro. Roman's juicy carne deshebrada, due to lengthy stewing in chilies and spices, really doesn't require any additional sauce. Nonetheless, I added the salsa bar's thick salsa roja during my visit, and the smoldering combination induced delirium. This is not barbacoa, it's not even just carne deshebrada, it's heaven in a tortilla.</text>

I lived in Costa Mesa for most of my life. This place has one of the best Torta Cubanas I've had in OC. Mixed with their fresh avocado salsa verde! PERFRCTO! (It is spicy for people who cant take spice. Lol)

I also enjoy their tacos al pastor, chimichangas with shredded beef,enchiladas and their BIG chicken quesadillas! their  cheeseburgers are made very tasty as well.

It is a bit pricier but there portions are big and it is worth it!<//review>

<text>This is a small walk in place with menu on the board behind the counter. Prices are a little higher than I would like for a walk in as they haven't much of an overhead. But if you're in the area and want Mexican food there's nothing wrong with giving it a try. I had the fish taco which was good.</text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

<text>Absolutely delicious! Great selection, the authentic Mexican food you're craving, they have several salsas including a very spicy chipotle type flavor, and who doesn't appreciate a menu complete with a picture of the item next to the description. What they actually serve is even better than the picture. Loved this place, great food and excellent service.</text>< Pics>

< Review>
Amazing taqueria hidden on North Newport Blvd. in Costa Mesa! Most everything I have tried has been delicious and made to order. The carnitas are my favorite, always crispy and juicy at the same time. The tacos are huge! Definitely worth the price. The salsa bar has several varieties that are always fresh, and are comprised of all heat levels. They also have a large beverage cooler wall with many varieties of drinks, from juice, and sodas in glass bottles, to beers and teas.. Highly recommend.< /Review>

Great people.
The salsas  and chips were great! The food is made in front of you..basically. it's very tasty and definitely reminds you of Mexico. The price though. Not bad, but a little to high imo.</review>

Love the food. But if you call in an order for pickup,  always add 10-15 mins to whatever time they tell you. A bit slow on the prep side.<//Review>

This places Pozole is off the chain. One of the top 3 I have ever had. If it's rainy/cold (I know, I know, the one day a year) then definately stop in and grab a bowl. You won't be disappointed. They also have killer tacos, nom nom nom al pastor, and have a great selection of beer and soda if you want to dine in.<//Review>

The burritos are big and the salsa is bomb. I go here when I get tired of Chipotle and want something more Mexican. They have tons of drinks in their fridge. Nothing too special about the actual place or the service, though.</review>

<review>They did not have enough people working to get orders out very quickly. Even with the girl making drinks for the store and the drive thru as well as ringing up in store customers working like a madman. She was still polite and friendly.
I am giving the rating for upper managments needing for better Saturday personal scheduling.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

Drive through person that handles the money hands the cup to you by holding the top of the cup where I'm about to put my mouth.  When I said something about it I was told (I only tough the edges.)  This happened to me at 2 different stores in Rocklin Ca. This has to be blamed on Management.</text>

This has always been my top to go to Starbucks because of the environment. Super nice employees and are very up to my standards, with cleanliness and professionalism. The environment its self is very cozy, they recently upgraded there furniture. I would also like to add on that it gets quite busy here during the weekdays and especially on Saturday because of Sierra College is right across the street. But I have no problem since I come here usually the evening.< /text>

This is a great Starbucks right across from the college and the service is fast and friendly. Not too noisy inside good spot to study. The only issue is the parking lot. Its small and hard to maneuver but manageable. Im here about once a week and the service, coffee and ambiance is always top notch.< /review>

This is the closest Starbucks to Sierra College, so you find ample tables for work and study.  It is a very comfortable location to get some work done while enjoying the affordable luxury the brand delivers.</review>

I'd been directed to meet a friend at this "coffee shop." Upon getting there, I realized that the "coffee shop" was actually a Starbucks. Inasmuch as Starbucks is anti-law enforcement, anti-US Armed Forces, anti-Second Amendment, and generally counter-Constitutionally inclined, I contacted my friend, and we agreed to meet elsewhere. It's a nice enough landmark, but it's not a place any self-respecting American would voluntarily frequent.

Not as busy as some of the others in the vicinity, so kind of nice to go there to study or work from time-to-time. Great drive thru service, and for whatever reason, seems to be faster than others. Nice and very friendly staff! Took a star off because it's frequently a little on the dirty side inside.</text>

I come here all the time and today I came in for a drink before work. It was 8am and I had expected it to be busy, and so I patiently waited in line until my turn. As the person before me was making their order with one of the employees, another basically stomped to the front to take my order. I had politely asked for whatever I wanted to drink, yet the employee taking my order was rude enough to yell at me saying that she couldn't hear what I was saying. The store wasn't that busy and it wasn't that loud for anyone to have to speak up that much. No one else did. I repeat my order and for the second time she misunderstood what I said and I had to correct her, again. She rushed taking my order and I didn't even have the chance to mention I wanted soy milk instead of the regular, until the other employee moved over to register my order on the cash register. When she rushed to make my drink, she ran around as if the ground was on fire and she basically slammed the equipment. Again, it wasn't that busy for her to run around like a machine in overdrive. I've worked at a cafe before having to serve up to 200 guests at the same time and I understand you want to help customers as quickly as possible but doing it with a bad attitude isn't going to help and it was only off-putting. I also understand that stress during rush hours can be hard to disguise but a little smile towards your customers wouldn't hurt. I didn't have to be yelled at, thank you very much.<//review>

Who in the world closes at 7:30pm ... especially across the street from a college. Throw in the towel and let a worthy business step in. You’re a waste of space.</Text>

Lots of places to sit down and study. Perfect for students. They even open at 4:30 am. The staff here are always kind and courteous.<//review>

<Review>Ok confession: I'm a Starbucks fan. I have dark roast as my fav. I've never had the foofoo drinks, so can't place a judgement here. I do eat the different breakfast sandwiches on the fly-by. I like them and mostly healthy. Staff is efficient even in rush hours. Always a good restroom.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

<review>Amazing staff, Amazing coffee, the staff makes feel welcome and right at home. There nice, sweet, kind and when or if you come here they will ask how is your day and they will remember your order and they will remember you as well. They also cook the food really good and the place is really clean also. I personally would HIGHLY encourge everyone on coming here. When you come here if feels like all of your stress and probloms have just vanished and they will always put a smile on your face each and everytime.<//review>< gmap_id>

It's a great place to go and study, the staff is friendly and it's usually quiet. There are usually around half a dozen or so students from Sierra College there at any given time.< /text>

< Review>
Worst Starbucks ever. Refused to remake my drink. Because they dont make it right. I want to drink my coffee, not the water with milk. One of the workers called a police on me and she said that I trew a drink at her and I was drunk. Wich is lies. Police came had no problems passing alcohol test. Will never go there again.</Review>

They have great coffee and tea, and many wonderfully delicious beverages and pastries. It's Starbucks, the only real difference between them is the architecture and the staff.</review>

Crazy to go to a coffee shop at 11:30 in the morning and they have no dark roast. It is a coffee shop, after all! Starbucks policy is to have dark roast til noon. Another place I won't stop.<//Text>

<date>1495216766085<//date><Rating>5<//Rating><Text>Great store nice prices. However, they did send me on a wild goose chase up to their San Clemente store for a size they didn't have and when I got up their they showed me a different shoe in my size. They offered me a 10 percent discount. So I purchased a different pair. To make matters worse it was the end of the night and I left them there at closing time. I called back the next morning and the same gentleman who rang up my shoes was skeptical but, told me to stop by to work it out. I thankfully picked up my Crocs and ended up buying a few more pair and some charms/gibets. It wasn't the Carlsbad locations fault. They asked the San Clemente store for the specific pair.

For a first-time experience it was pretty good. But the staff is kind of not very personable with kind of a chip on the shoulder attitude. This franchise needs to work on better training for more or less attitude and happier faces.
Hey everybody it's ice cream it's happy time try that !!</review>

Let me start off by saying I have never in my life felt so disrespected and humiliated. My only fault was being a loyal customer for the last 8 months, spending at minimum $50 dollars a week on "icecream", receiving multiple unlimited cups for enormous amount of frozen yogurts I consume and provide for my study group students. The store manager named Aaron was extremely disrespectful and rude beyond belief. I have never taken the time to write a negative review about a business or about anybody, but this was necessary. I will never ever walk in to this store ever again and I will make sure anybody that I know will not as well because of a rude young man who has a title of store manager and behaves in such a disrespectful way, being a "perfect" example for other workers. You guys seriously need to re-evaluate who you hire and more importantly who you hire as managers to lead by example. Upon my observation throughout the months of visiting, he would always (10/10 times) hide behind utility room (I'm really curious what he is always doing back there during his working hours) and when I make noises from the machines he would slowly walkout as if I'm an invisible person. That is completely okay and I don't mind that anymore. I am not a person patronizing workers by requiring them to greet me. But as I walked out of the door strenuously carrying multiple cups of icecream as usual, he shouted at my back, "WELCOME!" thinking I'll leave without even saying thank you. I guess he thinks customers have the obligation to act certain ways but he doesn't. Moreover, he talks to everyone in such a patronizing way, its so hard to describe and extremely difficult to hear. Botton line, I quit going to frozen yogurt and most certainly to this location where Aaron works. Aaron does not deserve to have this job and more importantly does not deserve to have a job as a general manager.
Thank you so much for taking your precious time to read my review.<//text>

I get that this place is busy but there always out of at least one flavor when I go here and sometimes the machines smell bad almost like sour milk (maybe don't clean the ice cream out from the spill tray or something). Cleanliness of this location definitely needs to be improved.</Text>

<Review>compared to Yogurtland outlets in other areas, this one provides about two thirds of the flavors and no seating inside. There are fewer flavors and fewer toppings available. Still, the quality is about the same as other Yogurtland locations. Situated in a beautiful plaza adjacent to a water fountain and plenty of outdoor seating.< /Review><rating>4<//rating></record>

Usually a great place but after every party at the school the kids come and tonight the manager went on a break and the machines were empty and we waited on line for 20 minutes and had nothing to eat.<//review>

<Text>Do not go to this location.  It is small and only has half the flavors as the Spectrum. The only person working there was really rude. I made a comment to the person I was with that I didn't like the store because they had half the flavors and no whipped cream.  The guy working there rudely said, "I heard what you said ". He had no right to comment as I was talking to my friend,  not loudly , or to him. I will not be going back to this location. The one at the Spectrum is so much nicer and the employees are professional.< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

<Review>If you are craving Yogurt, go here. No other words can describe how satisfying yogurt is when you're craving it. Beautiful location in the Heart of Irvine, right off the 405. Next to some awesome restaraunts, movie theater, and Water Fountains that together make it an elegentful Night.< /Review>< Pics>

It's a great location for a yogurt shop, but it has very few flavors compared to most Yogurtland locations. They only had 1 of the 4 on the poster in their window.< /Text>

Great so far. Both Jaime and Stephanie are really responsive and that is a change from some of the other apartments I have communicated with. Community looks great and I expect to continue having a great experience with management and leasing. Will update if needed as time goes on.< /review>

<Text>Centre Club is nothing less than amazing! When living here I was extremely happy with my home and community. I lived here for 2 years with my Husband and Son. We talk about this home often, we really enjoyed our time here. We were in the building right next to the park and we loved the convivence of getting to go outside and play. Our backyard was literally a park! SO awesome when you have a little one. Our neighbors were so kind and friendly! The office staff is remarkable. Stephanie, Jamie, and Janet are so helpful and welcoming! I feel like I am talking to family when we chat. The service team is so talented and professional. I accidentally over loaded my washing machine and Jimmy was quick to jump in and help! Monse and Stephanie are also so amazing! They completed all our work orders quickly and efficiently.

Everyone here is so friendly and cares about their residents. We ended up transferring to another Equity community because we needed the extra room for our youngest Son. We will always love Centre Club! Everyone here has a special place in our hearts. Thank you guys for all that you do!

If you have a chance to stop by and check them out please DO! You will not regret it.<//Text><name>Destiny Solis<//name>< rate>

Literally the worst management staff and apartment complex I've ever lived at. There are many issues here: Car theft, habitual smokers breaking the rules in a "non-smoking apartment complex", tons of non-maskers, and Equity Apartments the parent company increasing rent by up to 20-30% (however much they can get away with really). The legal annual increase allotted is only 7.3% by the way. If you can help it don't live here.< /review>

My husband and I enjoy our stay her. The staff is great from leasing to maintenance. It is quiet (at least on our side) and being equity apartments is a bonus! Stephanie one of the Leasing Consult is absolutely wonderful! Stephanie, you rock! Keep doing what you do!< /Text>

<text>I lived here for 1.5 years from Jan 2017 to July 2018 and I loved it there! I’ve lived in a lot of apartments, some small with local owners and some run by corporate owners like this one, and this was my favorite complex by far. Some of the maintenance employee’s work is a little sub par (one sealed a leaky toilet instead of replacing the wax ring, but later a different worker came and replaced it with a second maintenance call) but I never had any real issues with them. The office staff really took the time to know me (especially Stephanie) and some of the maintenance workers as well. The pools aren’t heated but always clean. My only real complaint is the cleaning lady or landscapers don’t police the trash in the planted areas so if you live near the 4th street side you’re going to see build up of trash. I did wish they had more parking available. The elevator was convenient with little ones and strollers, as was the trash chute. The apartments are a tad pricey but it was better than a run down place for sure! I’m a veteran and my husband joined the Army during our lease so we did have issues with getting our paychecks on time a few times but Stephanie and the company worked with us in our situation. I do feel we have been a tad overcharged to replace carpet but I’ve seen worse from other companies. Overall I loved this place and I greatly miss them as I am now dealing with a terrible leasing company on base.< /text><pics>None</pics><Response>None< /Response><Gmap_id>0x80c335a4a30b2967:0xb0bd199af50f4057<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I have only been here a few months but I am in Heaven on Earth at Centre Club apart-ments. The size, the staff, the amenities, the staff, the huge garage, did I mention the staff!  These are the most pleasant people that I have had the pleasure of leasing with, they are very quick to respond to any maintenance needs I have.  The property visitors that come and feed us, wow, what can I say, the last few months have been awesome,  and I couldn't be happier living anywhere else 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣</text>

I have lived in this complex for 7 months now, and I have to say that it has been an absolutely fantastic experience. The complex is clean and beautiful. It is very quiet and peaceful. The amenities are well above par, though a clubhouse for games and activities would be a great addition! The office staff here is AMAZING!! They are awesome people who truly care about your comfort and happiness as a resident. There are times where I make up a reason to go into the office just to enjoy their hospitality. And as far as the maintenance staff, and response time and attention to maintenance calls...they are absolutely top-notch. Their maintenance staff is friendly and professional, and they always try to get things done in a timely manner. I would have absolutely no problem recommending this facility to anyone looking for a clean and family-friendly environment. Thank you, Centre Club, for making this apartment feel like a home!</text>

I’m so happy for those who had a great experience, but my and all others in my unit was awful, to start I came from a luxury apt thinking I was coming to luxury (centre club) nothing could have been further from the truth , I was shown a model that looked nothing like my unit “ because it wasn’t ready yet “ once I received my keys I spent 3 days cleaning , complaining about the broken amenities, cut up bathroom and kitchen tiles , glued toilet base , holes in shower , broken faucet handles, the list goes on and on ,not to mention when our garage got broken into the office staff said “ call the police “ no compassion at all fortunately we used AAA for renters insurance so the stolen items were replaced , the cameras are there for show they do not work , at least that’s what we were told from office staff..after all that we finally relocate out of that place , to receive a bill for carpet that we didn’t wear shoes in , do yourselves a favor make sure you see your unit before you sign your lease , and watch out for all of the dog waste around the community. My best wishes.</review>

I lived here back from 2017-2018, and I regretted moving to the point that I just signed a lease and moved back here for 2019 to forever. of all the apartments I've lived in (at least 10), this has been the best. the management really care about you and take the time to know you personally. when I called about leasing and said my name, they remembered me and asked about my son. I was actually overwhelmed and Happy to know a place remembered my family.  it is a little pricey compared to other places but you pay for safety, comfort, and plus some of your rent goes into equity for a KB home. if you plan to get a home in the future,this is ideal. thank you again to everyone at the office. ❤️ you guys made me feel accepted and Happy to know my son will live in such a warm environment.</Text>

<Text>This apartment management are a complete scam. They give your the best affordable rent in the area just to have you move in. After your first 12 months lease expires, they do upgrades in your apartment to raise your rent by $200. Then every year, they raise your rent by $100. They indicate its because the rental value increased. So this year, rental values were less then the rent of my apartment then they stated it was because my apartment’s amenities and the location of my apartment near the pool. It’s always reason after reason why the rents keeps increasing every year and it will never be at the current rental value. The tenants are constantly moving out due to this big problem. If you to want housing stability for your family, Center Club is not the place for you.

When I called to resolve my rent issue, Jamie from the leasing office was extremely rude.  When I arrived home my heater was not working and I called to Brianne, leasing manger to discuss my concerns and request emergency maintenance but she did not call me back and no one came to fix my heater. My baby was shivering all night due to the freezing weather.</Text>< pics>

Apartment is amazingly redone, the only thing I have a issue with is the trash area, they get full really quick. For the most part it’s quiet and plenty of parking for guest. Also the maintenance staff is on point with handling your maintenance request. Office staff is really friendly which is hard to come by these days. Thank you.<//Review>

THE ABSOLUTE WORST PLACE YOU COULD PICK TO LIVE. They advertise a gated community, but the gate is left wide open all day. You pay for security that is NEVER there. My car was broken into, a neighboring apartment broken into and a lady was held at knife point in the parking lot and the office didn’t care one bit. Put your money into a better complex that will care about you as a resident. We were completely overcharged in our move out. The apartments are not nice enough to pay what you do and they will screw you out of every penny. STAY AWAY.<//review>

This is a great place to live. I have been living here for about 5 years now. The only problem I had was that someone broke into my garage and took a few items but otherwise there's been no other problems. No problems with the neighbors. Everyone seems to get along here. The office staff is so wonderful and do all they can to make your living here a pleasant stay. Also the maintenance staff is great.</text>

<review>So far, so good, except for one problem. We cannot get our parking spot figured out. We are supposed to have space 39, but that doesn't exist. In front of our apartment, the space starts at 40. On the north end it goes from 25-27, then 37 & 38. I have spoken to a couple girls at the office, with no results. Like to get that resolved.
The apartment though is fantastic. Vaulted ceilings, and state of the art kitchen appliances. It is also nice and quiet, plus the neighbors seem nice enough.
I give this 4 stars due to the carport issue. Will move to a 5 when that is resolved.</review>< response>

<time>1463256826304<//time><rate>5<//rate><review>I am a military wife and i have moved so many times and lived in different places and since my husband has retired from the military and we moved back to Cali it has been hard to find a place that has everything that we were looking for some places were to small some places didn't have washer dryer hook up and some places we looked at the staff weren't friendly and it just became very stressful. So we went back online and we found Centre Club Apartments so we called the next day and went to check out the place. When we got there the staff were really great and very friendly the person we worked with his name is Shawn and he made things very simple and easy for us which in our book is always great. Centre Club Apartments is a quiet and gated community they have a nice club house which leads to one of the pools and a workout room so you don't have to go to the gym they have a tennis court and they are close to parks, shopping and food areas. If your looking for a place that is close to everything  has a wonderful staff that cares about you and is a gated community then this is the place for you to live.</review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

These apartments are great!
We have an apartment right beside the playground. My little ones play there all the time.
The pools are beautiful.
The office staff is the nicest I have ever dealt with.
We go for a walk daily. We can walk the path that leads to the elementary school, and the large and awesome playground that sits next to complex.
We are a short  drive from the grocery store, library, Target, and the mall. It is convenient to several hwys that run through Los Angeles and all of the surrounding areas.
Our apartment itself is beautiful. We have two huge bathrooms, wood floors throughout, a huge porch that over looks the playground.
The neighborhood is quite and safe. Great for kids. Great to walk dogs.
The gym is fantastic.

I shopped around before moving here, and this apartment was the absolute best choice.< /Text>

<Review>We have lived here a little over a year and a half. I doubt any apartment is perfect, but this place is about as close as you can get. The maintenance team is always working to keep the grounds clean, fresh, and up to date.

Property management is great. They are very informative, nice, helpful, and all the ladies have a great personality. They collect your packages in case they don’t fit in your mailbox or is too sensitive to be dropped off at your door, they notify you when you have a delivery, they send out emails letting you know about apartment updates/food trucks/strong wind advisories/payment reminders (before you are late)/and general apartment information.

It’s a great place for pets. Plenty of areas for them to do their business, with proper disposal areas. And there is a park near by where you can walk your pets around.

The apartments themselves are pretty quite. We are directly above garages (we occasionally hear them open) but that is about as loud as it gets around here.  (Please understand these are apartments, you’ll be living around several families....you may hear occasional chatting in the hallway, or moving in/out. However, most of our neighbors are pretty polite, and we rarely notice them.)

We have our own laundry which is incredibly convenient. The lighting is all energy efficient. We will be getting upgraded thermostats soon. The appliances are up to date (electric). The floors are light faux wood. The rooms are spacious. And you can own a BBQ. We have an elevator. (Talk about making moving day so much easier!) There is also plenty of parking. Centre Club also has pools, spas, tennis court, and a gym.

Also, the complex has food vendors who will set up in front of the office every so often. You can experience a large variety from hamburgers, hotdogs, burritos, to churros and funnel cakes, etc. It’s perfect for those nights you don’t want to cook. Head on down and buy some good food!

These apartments are in a great location as well. You will be close to groceries, shopping centers, schools, entertainment, and even an airport (which you vary rarely ever hear).

If you choose to live here. Please be a proactive member. Say hi to the staff, be kind to the ladies in the front office, pick up after your pets, and inform the staff if the complex isn’t up to par. They can’t fix it, if they don’t know it’s broken. These little things help this location stand out from the rest.</Review><Time>1523135691436<//Time><Gmap_id>0x80c335a4a30b2967:0xb0bd199af50f4057</Gmap_id><Rate>5< /Rate>< Pics>

<Pics>None<//Pics><Text>This is a wonderful place to call home! We moved here in 2015 with every intention of only being here for one year. It's now 2017 and we are going to be moving into a different unit in this same complex and don't ever want to move! The few repairs we have needed have been completed in a timely professional manner by a dedicated, friendly staff. The grounds are well maintained. This is a very pet friendly community. We love all our doggie neighbors being dog owners ourselves! The office staff here, especially Stephanie, is outstanding. Every time you pass by them, they say hello. They are always eager to help. Their dedication doesn't end once you sign your lease like at some places. When we first looked at the apartments, Stephanie spent a good hour taking us around, showing us different units so we could be sure we would have what would fit our needs the best. Never once did she rush us or make us feel like we were an inconvenience to her. In fact, she told us that our satisfaction was her job! She has held that same attitude for the two years we have been here. These apartments are in a great location as well. Right off the 10 and 15, close to the 210 and 60. Lots of shopping and restaurants within minutes. The elemtary school is very close and it is a decent school for your kids to go to.

If you are looking for a place to call home, not just a place to live, you should move here!< /Text><rate>5</rate><GmapID>0x80c335a4a30b2967:0xb0bd199af50f4057</GmapID>< time>

<Time>1509352545347</Time><Rate>3</Rate><Review>We’ve lived here for almost 2 years now. I have to say, they are just ok. The office staff is friendly and we have never had an issue with them. But the community itself is not always the cleanest. The stairwells are pretty disgusting. At least in my building. They repainted them about 6 months ago but they didn’t even power wash them or spray them down. Just painted over the dirt pretty much. The buildings are pretty old too, they did do updates to all the kitchen and bathrooms which is nice, but the structure itself is old and creaks. My neighbor upstairs walks around and it’s a very loud cracking noise I can hear. It’s bothersome because I have a young child who is a light sleeper. Also, it is pet friendly but there are several people who do not pick up after their dogs. I have seen dog pee in the elevator numerous times (luckily they do mop the elevators) but there has been dog poop on the sidewalk for weeks that nobody bothered to pick up, it just has been left there to dry up. And also on the grass there’s always that one resident who leaves their dogs poo there! Luckily management is going to start DNA testing the poo to find out whose animal it is (yeah crazy I know). But also really cool, and hopefully people will start picking up after their animals. Also, we have seen roaches. We are clean people so I’m not sure if a neighbor had roaches and a couple wandered into our apartment or what....most of the incidents have been isolated, but there was a period of time when we had a bunch of baby roaches in our bathroom and kitchen. I’d find a couple of them daily. All they did was send Orkin into my apartment to spray chemicals every 2 weeks. I personally did not feel comfortable with that because even though they are “safe” for children, everything is safe until it’s not safe. So I told them to stop coming. I feel that management should have tried to eliminate the problem rather than try to just cover it up with bug spray. Luckily, I think I found their entryway. The seal around the toilet was coming off and as soon as they put a new seal around it, I stopped seeing bugs. Except I did find one months later on my kitchen counter but it seemed to be random. Still, I honestly can’t wait to move out of here because on top of all that, my neighbor is noisy and is up very late stomping around. My fiancé wakes up at 4am for work so this causes problems. I personally feel safe living here, at least in my building. There have been break ins before, but none that affected me. It’s close to the freeways and shopping so that’s nice. There are some sketchy areas nearby though. Go one way and it’s industrial. Go the other and it’s a bit rundown. The rent is also pretty high in my opinion. Especially considering that the company (equity) is so cheap. They’ll try and save a buck anyway they can. When we moved in, our carpet was clearly very used...even after it was shampooed it had stains and looked worn down. But if it’s not 5 years old, they won’t replace it. And the carpet quality is poor to begin with. On the plus side, we had all brand new appliances when we moved in! Just wish the stove was gas. Overall, it’s not a GREAT place to live but also not bad.. I feel that some of the details are overlooked and I feel like it’s those details that make a place feel like home. They do have food trucks come by once a month or so which is cool and gives a sense of community here so I will give them kudos for that. If you’re looking to move here, I’d suggest getting a unit in one of the newer phases they have built. Those ones aren’t 4 stories and they don’t feel as old. They are also more asthetically pleasing to look at, they aren’t organized all in a row to make you feel like you’re living in a hotel, and have newer garage doors.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

<GmapID>0x80c2ea059628f7c7:0xc665d88453135e6d<//GmapID><review>The triage nurse was great, thank you for the great service. However the staff & nurse practitioner- alarmingly terrible. Never saw the doctor. My doctor actually recommended I go to the ER due to spinal issues I had experienced the night before. Do not recommend going here if you feel that you need help. They completely disregarded my request for MRI or CAT scan.  In fact the nurse practitioner said they do not do that there, keep in mind I had just seen another patient go get a CAT scan/MRI so she just blatantly lied to me. The nurse practitioner was so condescending, and no help whatsoever. A compete waste of my time- they need to do better. There are better places to chose than here.

Additionally, there was an employee walking around coughing towards me and other patients (with mask) but not turning away at all- just grotesque behavior. What a terrible experience.  Maybe the actual doctors may be knowledgeable, so there’s still hope for them- however I’ll never go back here for emergency care.< /review><userid>117670692900948895673<//userid><time>1623847571136</time><Name>Diana Montano<//Name><rate>1<//rate>< response>

<Text>I would give zero if an option.  Worse hospital ever.  Went in ambulance for severe stomach pain.  The doctor introduced himself and left the room.  I never saw him again until 2am for honestly 2 minutes.  6 hours later.
I was discharged from the ER in the same pain I arrived in.  They are extremely rude and unprofessional.
Due to the unprofessionalism and obviously not caring, 3 days later I find out I have a GI bleed.  That's close to malpractice in my opinion.
I do not recommend USC Keck and feel they are completely incompetent!!<//Text>< time>

Verdugo Hills hospital is truly an amazing place. Situated in an idyllic location nestled in the hills, yet next to the fwy, surrounded by much greenery, beautiful views of the San Gabriel Mountains, birds chirping and state of the art equipment not to mention the AMAZINGLY caring, kind and dedicated team of nurses, doctors, medical school students, janitors, security and office personnel. I interacted with all of these folks in just a few short days while my mother was under their care and I felt I had a support team who helped me get through very stressful situations and challenges that I didn’t have the training nor mental strength to handle anymore. They were patient, respectful, great listeners, kind, tenacious, loving, funny, helpful and dedicated to name a few. When I drove off looking forward to going home my heart was overflowing with gratitude and my mind was thinking of a dozen ways to go back another day to Thank them and show my respects, appreciation for their commitment and grace under fire. Thank You all for all you do/did for my family, myself and so many other patients. God bless you and your family and careers.<//Text>

Any emergency room hospital visit is distressing, however, during these times of COVID 19 the ER is one of the last places one wants to go. USC Keck Verdugo Hills Hospital ER immediately helped me during my recent medical emergency. The staff was caring, nurturing and professional. I felt very comforted and confident that they were going to resolve my medical issue.  I hardly waited for care, diagnosis and treatment. There was a calm energy and reassuring atmosphere.   Hoping I never have to go to the ER again; however, I would return to and highly recommend USC Keck Verdugo Hills Hospital emergency room and the entire caring staff! Thank you so much to every person in the ER!<//Text>

I hoped to never need to review an emergency room, but here I am... I went to the ER with severe chest pain and pressure. Obviously a very scary experience. When I arrived I was checked in by a nurse within 5 minutes, and as soon as I was brought back to a bed I was attended to non-stop by doctors, nurses and techs. I was given multiple (necessary) tests and wasn’t discharged until they were sure what was causing my symptoms. Clearly explained everything to me to make sure I understood what was going on. They were able to relieve the symptoms and sent my results to my PCP immediately (also part of the USC system). The doctors and nurses made sure to answer all of my questions without rushing me. I never want to need the ER again, but if I do, I know I’ll be in good hands at Verdugo Hills.</text>

<text>We live on the east side of Pasadena but we frequent the movie theater across Verdugo Hills Hospital a lot. This is the closest USC hospital to us that has an ER. I didn’t have to wait, was seen right away and in a few hours was admitted to my room. The staff are so great and pleasant here!

It was great they were super attentive and made sure if I had any questions, even if they didn’t know the answer, they would find out. They accommodated for my needs and made sure that I knew that if I needed ANYTHING to just ask. I really appreciate the staff and hopefully I don’t have anymore but I know where I’m going next time I have a medical emergency.</text>

I was treated very good and my needs were met regardless of the pandemic. I was very scared to go get checked out but had no choice I had fallen 6 times before going to the E.R. When I arrived I was very impressed on how well everyone handled the patients especially the potential Covid patients. The nurses were awesome and did their best to keep me assured that I was in good hands.  Im very grateful that I was able to get the help I so desperately needed....< /text>

Ever since you guys became apart of the USC Group everything is so much better! I'm grateful for the Dr i got because when giving me a new medicine he took into account my medical history and changed the medicine so I wouldn't be affected by a side effect! I've never had that kind of care when I've had to be seen there! Thank you for being so kind, sensitive and overly helpful!!</Text>

I’m very happy with the service.there wasn’t any where much to sit but it only took a few minutes. Before someone was there to show me where to go and everyone was very pleasant. The doctor who assisted was so nice and she seem to understand what might be the problem , and with a few more questions, I knew that’s what it had to be but I have never had this high level of pain. I had been going with the increasing pain for about two weeks and the medications prescribed are doing some what good but there is still ex reps of pain off  and on.
But I’m not blaming anyone, I just gave this ability.</text>

I am very unimpressed with the level of service at USC Verdugo Hills Hospital.  Within 45 minutes  I was diagnosed, given an ultrasound,  a Covid test. And admitted  for treatment. Staff is very friendly and make you feel like they care about you.  Thank You for being here for all of us!</Text>

I went to the ED because a co-worker tested positive for covid-19 and I needed to be tested. I was seen promptly, efficiently, professionally, and kindly. I got my results back within 48 hours. Verdugo Hills Hospital seems to do everything right. Thanks<//Text>

I was disappointed with the initial ER Doctor she was looking at me like I was contagious I got a weird vibe off of her. I’m sure she probably thought I had COVID but I didn’t. One of the nurses was so unprofessional she was asking me how to get a sample of fluid from my Catheter because I’m a PD patient. I wasn’t given pain medication I had a high fever and was Miserable there. I wouldn’t want to go back! Other than that everyone else was professional.<//Review>

<review>Uncle came here with a slice on his foot and they absolutely did not care in the emergency room. Waited almost an hour and then yelled and complained that they need to at least take a quick look and clean to prevent an infection because it was bleeding badly.

Their meats are really good and fresh. I really enjoy their cecina, it's fresh and thin. You can ask for a deal (example on price per lb)when you buy meat in bulk for like a party or something. There's also produce, fresh tortillas and sodas. There's a little bit of everything in there.< /review>

What I have as a new client I recommend that you go shopping and you will not regret everything fresh

<Review>Their donuts are among the top five I've had anywhere. They have figured out how to make each type of donut taste delicious with the perfect balance of crunch and soft on the inside. I always come here each time I visit Orland.</Review>< rating>

Best donuts for miles. We love the authentic flavor. Good prices, refreshing coffee and refreshment case. The place is family owned and they come out and talk to the kids.<//text>

<user>112894065800717230976<//user><Review>BEST DONUTS EVER. They beat other donuts places, by far. Krispy Kreme is NOTHING compared to Billy and Emily’s. Please please please, if you are in Orland...go to this store!!! The chocolate bow ties are the best, and the breakfast sandwiches can start your day completely perfect. Most definitely 5/5 stars!!!<//Review><Name>ChristianIsSHOOK<//Name><gmapID>0x8082fb375571f6cb:0xf2e824bf57c5ae26< /gmapID><Pics>None</Pics></record>

Purchased my Honda from another Honda dealership. I live near Roseville. Saw the reviews and decided to take my car here for the fuel pump recall for my 2019 Civic. James was great. He called me before my appointment that morning to let me know there was an issue and the part was unavailable. He called me back within 10-15 min and made it happen. I appreciated this because I was thinking this is my first experience with them. I got scheduled for a service two weeks in advance, but the fuel pump wasn’t available.

I’m glad James was checking the type of jobs that were coming in that day or else I would of went down to their dealership for nothing.

They had my car for a few hours and back in my hands the same day. I plan on going back for any other needs that may come up. Again, James was great, very informative and professional.<//Text>

Came in and knew exactly which vehicle I wanted and ready to sign.  Spoke to a wonderful salesman names Christian, and with the help of Bianca in finance, I was driving my new vehicle that same night.  Smooth experience, and the employees were helpful with explaining each step throughout the process.</Text>

I had the privilege of working with Nate Scott and Kyle Smith. Both gentlemen were very helpful and knowledgeable and I never once felt any kind of pressure to buy. I explained to Nate exactly what I wanted and within an hour,  I was sold! Nate was extremely personable and went above and beyond in his service. Not only did he stay with me the entire time (despite being off the clock) he also gave me a snack because they were a little backed up and the wait was longer than usual. Kyle Smith in Finance was great as well. He was able to give me a package that fit exactly what I needed.  All in all I'm a happy customer . Two thumbs up gentlemen 👍🏽👍🏽<//text>

Overall had a great experience and would be willing to come back again even though there are Honda Dealerships closer to where I live. This was my first time buying a car (2021 CR-V), so I was pretty nervous coming in. But the salesperson I was helped by, Nate, was very pleasant and answered any questions and concerns I had. I wasn't pressured into anything when signing paperwork and the process was explained to me at each step. I definitely recommend checking them out!</Text>

<rate>1<//rate><Review>Worst car buying experience we ever had!!!! We live 2 hours away but went to Roseville as they had the exact color scheme and trim we wanted. We knew exactly what vehicle we wanted and agreed on price with the salesman - who was nice. That was the end of nice. We then sat in their showroom for over 3 hours before a finance guy showed up. We were just about to walk out. The finance guy, does the wave of the magic wand, look over here, which we weren't falling for and just insisted on him writing up the contract. We finally get the vehicle home, a manager called 2 days later and said, "Oh, there's a clerical error with the contract, can you come back up?" When we asked what the error was the manager said he did not know. He's never called us back, never explained his odd behavior or the call. This place is a joke!!< /Review><Name>michael kan</Name>< Time>

He arranged for us to test drive several cars that we were interested in. They had a big inventory, which meant a lot of different options to try out. He did not put a lot of pressure on us but made sure we had what we needed to make a good decision. He let us test drive the cars on our own, which meant we didn't need to wear masks and could spend plenty of time checking out the details of the car. We will definitely come back here and recommend it to others. We were very happy with the service we received!< /review>< pics>

I have dealt with multiple repair shops at the dealership and I have to say this was my best experience yet. The staff is very polite, knowledgeable and extremely professional. Dropping off my vehicle after hours in their lock box was very convenient. The next day they called me and verified they had received the keys and would start working on my vehicle immediately. They kept me informed through-out the entire process, even when ordering parts and had my vehicle fixed in no time. Overall great service!!< /review>

If you come prepared with financing/cash options and which warranties/add-ons you are willing to accept or decline then hopefully your experience will be as excellent as mine was!

I had an appointment at 10:00 am on a Saturday for an oil change and service. I was also singing on my house with a notary later that day. I was told the wait time was at least 3 hours. I explained to my service  advisor, James Foures Moon,  that I had an appointment with a notary early that afternoon.  James had me in and out in less than an hour!  All the while providing excellent customer service and professionalism!!<//text>

My husband and I got there around 1pm on a Sunday afternoon, we were helped and greeted by Vanessa. We were surprised at how busy they were during this time of the pandemic. Despite how busy they were, we still received top notch service. Two hours later, we finally decided on a vehicle and started on the process around 3:35pm, by 5:45 we were done with everything and on our way home with our new vehicle. We were out of there before some of the customers that were already there before us. Our financing agent is Cole and the manger that took his time to come speak to us is Brian. Vanessa, Cole, Brian and Cameron ( if I remember his name correct, he's new there) are the people we came in contact with that made our experience incredible smooth. They value our opinions, understand our needs and are mindful of our time. If you go car shopping at AutoNation Honda, ask for those Reps to assistant you. You will not be disappointed. We are very happy and satisfied with the service we got.</Review>< user_id>

I had a check engine light on my 2014 Honda Accord few days ago and I checked few Honda dealerships but they all are packed for service for few days. Luckily Honda Roseville in California offer me to drop by and I did. Later today Mr James Moon, service advisor called and introduce himself and set an expectation about the diagnosis charge of $164.95 which I authorized over the phone and told me that he will call me later about the detail of parts and labor if required to fix the problem. So around 5 pm he called back and let me know that due to high volume of repair job more detail diagnostics will be done the next day early morning. I was already expecting that because I just drop my car without an appointment. So next day around 10 am I received a call from Mr James that check engine light was due to thermostat of coolant went bad and it is covered in manufacture warranty. Bottom line, I don’t even have to pay for diagnostic charge, part or any repair. I was so happy to hear that. He mentioned that car will be ready to pick up in two hours or so. I drop dealership around noon and car was ready. Mr James was very courteous, professional and service driven gentleman as I also have a service industry background.He also go through some of the other possible job done in the coming days which I am planning to do by the end of month like changing spark plugs, brake fluids and transmission oil.I was expecting to pay $300 to $500 to fix the problem but what I really like about Mr James is that he put his time and effort to find out if this is something coverer under Honda warranty. Thank you Mr James moon and thank you Honda Roseville.</text>

We found the vehicle we were looking for online, called & it was waiting for us when we arrived. Appreciated the no-haggling fair price.  We test drove it alone without a salesman to answer questions about location of features. Even though we were paying cash, we were required to fill out a credit application. We were given a hard-sell on several very expensive warranties we refused. An hour later another less expensive warranty was presented....still refused. Five hours later the transaction was completed. Since the vehicle was very dusty & dirty with sap on it, AutoNation washed the car which was appreciated, but they couldn't get the sap off. We were given only one fob and told we'd have to purchase an additional one elsewhere if we needed it. This fob news transpired after spending all day at a no-haggling car sales business, just as we were eagerly wanting to leave. Overall we're happy with our vehicle, however the process could be improved upon.<//Text>

I had an issue with my emissions on my 2016 Honda Pilot. I went in expecting the worse and having to spend a lot of money on the issue. However, i was lucky enough to get Nicholas @ the service center and he was amazing! He was able to determine that the issue would be covered under a recall warranty and i ended up paying nothing! He kept me updated throughout the 2 day process on the status of my car. He was very polite, knowledgeable and an all around good guy. I appreciate the wonderful experience I had and keep up the great work!<//text>

< Review>
Absolutely fantastic place to buy a car! Went in to buy my first car and was immediately greeted by AJ who let me tell you... He's one of the nicest guys you will ever meet on the planet! He was extremely helpful and provided plenty of info about the cars I test-drove. Also took the time to look up as many vehicles that suited my needs and that was great!

Everything about my experience was great! The customer service throughout the whole lot was friendly, the place looked really nice and clean, and they really worked with me to get a great deal!

My finance guy was Wes and he was absolutely amazing as well! I know a lot of people get freaked out once they go talk to the finance department after agreeing to buy the vehicle, but Wes was everything you'd hope to run into when it comes to the final steps. Extremely kind, helpful, and very informative when it came to the different prices and support you get when purchasing a vehicle here.< /Review>

<review>My husband and I had such a wonderful experience here at the Auto Nation Honda Roseville. The employees that helped us were exceptional and offered very informative details about the car we wanted to purchase. Not only was the customer service highly satisfied, we felt valued and heard. Most places would just rush the sale and not go over the smallest details, but this establishment was willing to take the extra step and we were very comfortable and at ease with such approach. We walked out delighted with our purchase here. I want to personally thank the Sales Manager Albert, Sale Representative Peter and Financial Manager Tarek for their amazing customer service skills. Will be recommending this business to several of our friends.<//review>< pics>

The employees are extremely communicative with there customers so they know exactly what's going on, you never truly feel out of the loop. However, I highly recommend booking an appointment ahead of time early in the morning. Otherwise, you'll be spending majority of your day in there lobby space.<//review>

<user_name>Eugene Dorsey< /user_name><review>This was my first time coming to AutoNation Honda. Initially I was annoyed, due to my semi long wait for someone to acknowledge me. I picked up on the vibe that you get better service with an appointment rather than being a walk in. After 20 minutes, I was finally greeted by an advisor who introduced himself by the name of Jimmie. Jimmie, was very apologetic for the wait time, but was fast, friendly, and efficient with getting me checked in, completing the walk around, and explaining the different service I was going to have done; because of Jimmie and his excellent attention to detail I would return to AutoNation Honda in order to have service completed on my Accord. Thank you Jimmie for treating your customers well and being an all around great advisor.</review><userid>117721836104766460741</userid><Gmap_id>0x809b1f8cb7689c85:0xfd027cebb953408<//Gmap_id><date>1616565709000</date>< response>

Required on a vehicle that they had for sale. Fast response. Scheduled an appointment to see the vehicle. Day of appointment I confirmed with the salesman and when I got there the vehicle was in the shop. In a nutshell it's been over 2 weeks since my appointment with them and supposedly the vehicle is still in the shop. I think the vehicle was sold and instead of being honest about it... I got the run around.</Text>

My experience purchasing a car at AutoNation Honda in Roseville was the best experience I've ever had when buying a car.  No pressure and no surprises.   Got the car I wanted at the monthly payment I wanted (actually a few dollars less).  No haggling!  Anna was the best, she explained in detail every aspect of my purchase and went over the functions of my car.  Best experience ever,  I would highly recommend Anna at AutoNation Roseville , hands down!!!!< /Text>

<review>The repair supervisor Rich was personable and efficient. The repairs were covered by my 36 month warranty, therefore it was financially painless. I would warn people that Civics from 2016-2018 have poorly manufactured air conditioner condensers. Some but not all were covered in a class-action law suit. If your Civic's air conditioner  is warming don't hesitate to have it fixed if it's under warranty or covered by the law suit. If not covered, it will be an expensive repair.</review>< Response>

The "Low Tire Pressure" light went on last Friday, so I called the Honda Service department for an appointment, they said that there all the appointment times were filled, but to come by in the morning and they would try and fit me in.  I got there the next morning, and within an hour I was on my way with the tire fixed and the emergency message reset.  You couldn't ask for better, courteous service than I received at Roseville Honda.< /Review>

Well, I've been a client with you for over 5 years and purchased two cars. I am always treated well and given excellent service on my cars. But, I have to say Jimmie was especially good at his service and I will be asking for him when I need anything in the service department. Thank you for having quality employees and he should get a raise for his ability to multi task and stay focused!< /review>

There was a line of cars but Honda employee was working down the line letting customers know about the wait.  I chose to leave my key with my vehicle and took an Uber to a friend's house to wait.  I was told a couple of hours.  I received a call from the Service representative thanking me for my patience and business.  I was in no rush since I was visiting friends so didn't mind that it was around 3pm when I got a call to pick up my car.  I got back to Honda before 5pm and was on my way shortly thereafter.  Great service and follow up.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

We had THE BEST experience here! Jason Tracy took care of us from the very beginning. I would give him more than 5 stars if I could. Not only was he professional, but he made sure all of our needs were met, and then some. We will definitely be sending business his way! After having terrible experiences in surrounding lots, this place was a breath of fresh air and the entire business seemed to handle things the way every place should. Don't waste your time, and just go straight here. They are amazing.<//text>

<Review>I scheduled 3 weeks out for my 8:20am appointment for an oil change with Anthony. I arrived at 8:23am, the young man outside was quick to pulled up my paperwork and told that Anthony was on vacation and another service rep will be out soon. I looked as other cars arriving after me and parking behind me was helped but no service rep approached me. It was close to 8:50am before a service rep approached me. Told her I needed an express service for an oil and tire rotation, but since I am here, maybe they should inspect my sliding door because it won't stay opened, keep closing automatically. She said it will take 3 hrs for them to inspect and find out what is wrong with the sliding door, told her maybe next time since I don't have 3hrs to spare. Then she tried to sell me a $700 package for some valve adjustment that's needed on my 100,000 miles Honda Oddesey, she tried to pushed how important that I get it done. I looked at her, asked "didn't I get that done on my last visit", she looked at the previous service and said "oh, yes you did"...Sorry, wasn't gonna spent $700 again on a service that was performed on my last visit. As for the quick express service, by the time I got my van by, it was a bit pass 11am, from the time I parked to the time I drove off, almost 3 hours for an oil change. 3 hrs that I didn't have for the door inspection, 3 hours for "express service".</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>{'time': 1621707775804, 'text': "Hi, thank you for taking the time to leave us feedback.

I recently visited AutoNation Honda Roseville to have my car serviced and was provided above and beyond service. I came in for a simple software upgrade and walked away completely taken care of with new fluids, a new battery in my remote, and a car wash. Isaiah stayed in contact with me throughout the day to keep me updated of the progress and provided subject matter expertise to ensure I understood his recommendations. I truly appreciate how personable Isaiah was, he is an awesome asset to the team and made my day!<//Review>

<Review>I find my experience at Auto Nation Honda in Roseville to be excellent.  They are there at the time you need them and provide very good service. Especially my service advisor Jimmie Le, he will explain everything to me. I feel like we are having a conversation about what my car needs and options, I actually have a voice, instead of feeling steam rolled. I'm on my second Honda vehicle, first one lasted 16yrs, and all service was provided by AutoNation Honda in Roseville.<//Review>< pics>

<Review>The salesman was not very knowledgeable and professional.  We were told to keep the test drive below 10 minutes.  The Acura dealership said we could take our time as long as we were back by closing time.  If I’m spending thousands of dollars I should be able to drive the vehicle to make sure I like it and not be on a timer to return back; also the gas tank was completely empty so we were only able to drive around in the auto mall.  If we didn’t need the vehicle I would have walked away.  However the girl that helped us complete our financing was very professional and courteous.  She was the only one that checked in on us while we waited.  Salesman just got a free sale without any effort.</Review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

Angela Tic was a very pleasant, competent salesperson.  She gave me the transparent real price on the phone, and was there to help me when I arrived.  I shopped at three dealerships, their price was the best.  The paperwork was slow but they are crowded with 0 percent financing.  Love my new Honda CRA. I was not pressured to buy the car.  The price was the price.  Would shop with Angela again.<//Text>

<Text>Rich was very helpful and his service staff did a great job. They addressed some issues with my Civic si that weren’t normally included in the 30,000 mile check up but took the time to take care of my car. Much appreciated!< /Text></record></dataset><record>
<review>The GM reached out to see if I enjoyed my experience at Autonation Roseville Honda. This is what I had to say:

Hi Gary,

I reached out to Internet Sales and initially dealt with Jason. We had a few emails go back and forth and we got to a point where he asked to meet in person. I asked if he was available the next day and scheduled an appointment. I arrived and found he was off that day. I like to have a linear conversation and not repeat myself. He should have included the Internet Sales Associate that would be on shift in the email conversation. I had a pleasant experience with a young lady I think was named Anna. We played the haggle game, which I am not fond of. We got the car price to match the Internet price, but lost my business when the accessories were added in and no one could figure out how to remove them. Internet Price was not met, and I felt like this was a bait and switch to get me into the dealership. After 2 hours in the Dealership I chose to leave as I felt Autonation Roseville Honda did not have my best interest at heart.

I have found another Dealership that was honest, showed integrity, and made the process smooth as can be. I also did pay for accessories that I felt were of value and will advertise them via word of mouth if anyone needs to find a Honda Dealership to purchase from.

I hope your Sales Team is able to hold to an Internet Price and not have to add in accessories to fluff the price in the future.

Sincerely,
Nick<//review>< pics>

I will be 85 shortly and as most can imagine, have owned many cars since I turned 16. They have brought me to many dealerships and many makes and models. We have always enjoyed our Honda vehicles and this Accord is no different. The service I got to change oil and install a software fix for a recall was fast, efficient and pleasant. I was in and out much faster than I anticipated. The waiting area was full beyond capacity with people standing socially distant within range. I can find no part of my visit that was not above average.  I can only hope all my future visits go as smoothly,  A special thanks to Isiaih Mitchel.< /Review>

James at the service desk pulled off a miracle for me. I made an appointment over the phone, but it didn't show up when I arrived. James was able to pull his team together to complete my service in less than 2 hours. He was able to explain all of the ins and outs with me and answered all my questions. He even stayed over about 15 minutes to make sure I could do a late pickup!
I was very impressed with James and his team in Roseville!<//Review>

This dealership is by far the best I’ve been to! I had a pleasure with meeting with Jason Christian! He is the best car salesmen, I kid you not. He made my experience of trading in my vehicle extremely easy! I highly recommend going to him. He’s friendly, funny, and has super cool stories that will keep you entertained lol. Overall, everyone at this dealership is so friendly and welcoming. If it was up to me I would give them 10 stars! Absolutely incredible. Keep up the good work guys!</Review>

We have always gone to Honda for out cars. Last night we got the pleasure of having our sales person be a nice young guy named AJ. He was very friendly, funny, and had a ton of knowledge about the cars. He made sure to take his time and not rush us into anything. The entire situation felt very natural and stress free. Thanks again AJ!!<//review>

<review>Truly a No Hassle dealership experience! After visiting multiple dealers for a new car I was looking for; finally found a place that is totally deserves 5 star out of 5 in all areas. Until doing business with AutoNation Honda Roseville, I didn’t know that buying a car from a dealer could be so easy, convenient and fast. I did my price negotiation over the internet; as multiple sales managers were very helpful and asking right questions; listening my thoughts; then showed up on the dealer to test drive and finish paperworks. No surprises, no time wasting; and lots of great people running around the dealership. My car was clean and ready waiting for me to test drive in 5 min of my arrival; and entire process was done in an hour or so; with no hassle. AutoNation Honda Roseville Team configured my car on my choices prior to leaving there; gave me a great summary of technical features etc. At the end of the day; I had a great top rated experience that I wasn’t even expecting from a car dealer. I think the key is “people”. As I saw at AutoNation Honda Roseville, everyone from the time I walked in to depart was nice, courtesy, even funny; what a great environment! Thank you for making my new car purchase a NO HASSLE with great price and deals.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

<review>The sales lady was helpful and friendly. My main issue is, I had a scheduled appointment to purchase the vehicle that I had leased almost 4years ago. Immediately, I was approached by a gentleman who worked there, trying to get me to lease a 2020 civic instead. I firmly told him no, I want to purchase my current vehicle. He left, and my sales rep brought me the projected figures to lease the 2020 model. After nicely reminding her, I had only come in to purchase my vehicle (since my lease is almost up). She left and returned with the figures to buy my 2017 civic. I was utterly blown away. My used car went from owing a little over $12,500.00 to almost the same amount as the 2020 model. After careful review, I decided to sign a new lease and got the 2020 model. I love the new car! However, I wished they would have better explained the logistic when leasing.<//review><Gmap_id>0x809b1f8cb7689c85:0xfd027cebb953408</Gmap_id><user>100405460121203186485</user><pics>None<//pics>< username>

AMAZING experience from start to finish! I was very nervous shopping for a new car because the sales agent I usually go to, retired. AutoNation Honda Roseville took great care of me and my husband. We worked out most of the deal via text/email, then scheduled an appointment to test drive, and finish the deal. Buying a car can be a tedious and extremely long process, but everyone at AutoNation Honda Roseville made this an easy, hassle-free experience. Thank you to Kristy, Eddy, Adam, and Matt for all your help, transparency, and guidance! VERY happy! You've earned yourself a loyal customer!</Text>

While I did have quite a wait for the technicians to diagnose the issue with my '16 Pilot, I was completely confident they were doing everything in their power to properly fix the problem prior to a long trip we were taking to Utah the following day. Rich was great and when I called first thing that morning, Jasmine was able to get me right in at their open 7:30 am appointment. Very grateful!<//Text>

I'm very happy with my new vehicle that I bought  at Auto Nation Honda Roseville. It's my first newer vehicle in 19 years and I love the fuel economy of the Nissan Rouge and the all wheel drive features.

Most of the issues were addressed. Service was excellent. Advisor was excellent. However, my loose door seal was missed, and now my car slipped out of park into neutral and rolled while I was parked! This specifically was supposed to be a fix with software recall. Never happened before.<//Text>

<Review>My service tech, Doug, was great! He was very helpful and honest about what I should do right now and what could wait. I appreciate that when going to the dealer when the reputation can sometimes be to sell, sell, sell. I will definitely be coming back here for my service.< /Review><UserId.>114415798157678875161<//UserId.><user_name>Brendan Morgan< /user_name>< Resp>

< review>
The dealer Peter lied to my parents about the price of the warranty on a used vehicle. When they wanted to cancel they were told they had to wait 3 weeks to cancel it. Then, when we canceled it they told us it wouldn’t come off the bill for 3-4 weeks. Eventually we paid more money out of pocket to take the warranty off immediately. We also waited 3.5 hours on two separate occasions. The worst customer service by the car dealer and the financial department.<//review>

<username>Skip Close< /username><Review>We had an engine light come on and it was flashing several codes so we went directly to Auto Nation Honda in Roseville where we had purchased our car new. They took us right in and after some preliminary checking they asked to keep the car overnight.  The next morning we received a call that the car had been fixed and the culprit was a defective outside temperature sensor. It was kind of like finding a needle in a haystack of electronics, which describes today's modern cars. There was no specific code to guide them to that sensor so they did the diagnosis the old fashion way, one component at a time.  James did a great job for us!  We wish to thank Auto Nation for taking our new car in immediately and efficiently finding the problem. We love our Auto Nation Honda! Thanks James!</Review><gmap_id>0x809b1f8cb7689c85:0xfd027cebb953408</gmap_id><Pics>None</Pics><rate>5< /rate>< date>

<Review>I recently brought my Ridgeline in for an oil change and multipoint inspection. My service rep, James, was very timely, courteous, and thorough.
He reminded me that it was time to replace my timing belt and how important that service was in order to protect my truck's engine and the investment I've made in it. Thanks James! See you soon.< /Review><userid>116875232474667250897< /userid><Time>1618967415713<//Time>< Rate>

Terrible customer service! The lady who was helping me was very rude and disrespectful! Additionally, they charge a ridiculous amount of money for just a simple oil change. Finally, I have purchased full protection on my car; however; they still end up charging you a large amount of money for any diagnostics and come up with the excuse that is not covered by the protection.  I have purchased the platinum protection from them and it is supposed to me the top of the line and fix any issue with the vehicle. I will never buy a vehicle from them or do service.< /Text>

I’m from out of state and was blessed to have Jim as a service advisor. He has excellent customer service and always above board regarding services needed for our Hondas. The dealer and service center is within the Roseville Auto Mall. Give them a visit and look for James!< /text>

<text>If there was a way to leave a minus -10 review I would.  As we were driving off the lot with our "new" used car we realized there was a fog lamp out and were promised by Nathan Scott that since we lived in Modesto we could purchase a new bulb and they would refund us for the purchase...well, that was 2 months ago now and NOTHING has happened.  I have called, sent numerous emails with the receipt and pics of the new and old bulbs etc yet no one is refunding us the $ 66.99 (cost of factory bulb only...we paid to have it installed) They have managed to take a positive purchase and turn it in to the WORST car dealership experience ever!  DO NOT SHOP HERE if you expect to get any type of help/service after your purchase!!<//text><date>1616618885544<//date>< Rate>

Emmanuel,

Thank you for the awesome car buying experience. You are the most honest car salesman I have met. You can pass these kudos on to your boss. Tarek was also very professional and patient with us. I was determined not to buy a warranty. Good play, sir!. Rounded out with a final send-off with the GM. We will recommend AutoNation, Roseville! (Edit)<//review>< time>

This was a pathetic experience. I test drove the specific car I wanted, thought about it for a few days and contacted my sales rep to arrange purchase. His response was lackadaisical and I should have taken more notice of that. We negotiated the price, I agreed to it and we set an appointment for two days later to complete the paperwork because I live out of the Sacramento area. The afternoon before my appointment I got a text saying “sorta bad news”. They had sold the car. No phone call, no apology, no mea culpa. Customer service? No, it was customer abuse.</text>

AutoNation Honda dealership and service departments are professional, knowledgeable. I was treated respectfully and I learned alot concerning my purchase of a 2020 Honda Accord. This vehicle was worth all the time that is required to process a new vehicle. My experience was pleasant and comfortable.   Now it's your turn to experience  this same hospitality and take time to invest in quality of life by adding a Honda to your family.<//Review>

Made an appointment for an oil change. I had to wait 55 minutes in the breezeway before I  was helped. So much for making an appointment. I waited 3.5 hours for an oil change and multi point inspection.  I won't be back to get my vehicle serviced. Now I know why I've been going to Mel Rapton!<//Text>

Bad in follow ups. I literally have to keep calling about the status of the car I was supposed to get from clean auto program. I put $3,500 down with my own money, but nobody bothered to call me back. I want a refund I don’t care about getting the car anymore.

<Text>I wanted to leave a 1 star but they did have good customer service. I wasn't overall thrilled with my experience and I'm generally not one to leave a bad review, but I couldn't overlook this. I went in initially to get my tire looked at. It was continually going flat and I had to get it aired up every other day. They told me there was a nail in it and they'd patch it, though I had hoped for a new tire altogether, they said it wasn't part of the coverage I had signed up for. Fine, whatever. Not what I wanted but it is what it is. When the gentleman came back and told me how "everything else" in my car looked great, meaning he checked oil and other fluids. He did mention my back brakes needed to be changed soon, but I told him I'd get it done next time. That's not what I'm upset about. What I'm upset about was shortly after leaving with my vehicle, I went to my friend's house and it began smoking. Turns out no, they DIDN'T look at my oil, or else they would've told me I had none! I didn't realize I was bone dry on oil, and had they told me, I could've had them put oil in it, or do an oil change. The paper that they give you showed a big check mark on the green where the oil is. So either they really didn't look, they 'pretended' to look, or they straight lied to me. Either way, I could've ruined my motor and not realized it. I understand they were pretty busy but I had an appointment, I don't know if that matters though. Anyway, just a cautionary tale for other people, to make sure that whoever checks your car out is THOROUGH!<//Text><Response>{'time': 1613487820875, 'text': "Hi Sage, thank you for bringing this matter to our attention.

AutoNation Honda Roseville has always taken care of my wife and I. We used another dealer in the area before but have been loyal customers for our past 4 new Honda vehicles. Every sales associate and finance managers have gone out of their way to ensure we stay within our budget while still getting the vehicle we want.</text>

My husband and I purchased a new Honda CRV from AutoNation Roseville.  Kristie was most helpful, pleasant and knowledgeable in presenting the Honda CR-V to us.  Kristie made our buying experience great and hassle free. I would recommend AutoNation Honda and most especially Kristie.

Our initial visit with AJ sold us on Honda.He knew everything about all the models and trim levels.  Intelligent and definitely had done his homework on the product. One star less due to being pressured (not by AJ) to purchase extended warranties at extremely inflated prices.  Also, we had an appointment, all negotiations were complete before we arrived and first representative didn’t seem to know the details of the deal.  Finance advisor (even though there was no financing) was late in joining us.  Whole process took over 3 hours due to excessive wait time for all the players to appear.</Review>

< review>
We got a great deal, and ultimately walked away with a great van. After several confirmations on the price and features with our salesperson, we made the drive from the Bay Area to Roseville intending to pay cash and drive home quickly. It sounds like despite the repeated confirmations on price, it was still a mistake that had to be approved (which took several hours). It's frustrating that car dealerships are just wired to make you wait. I will make an effort to avoid dealerships for future car purchases. Nothing personal to Autonation Roseville Honda, they made it work in the end, hence the 5 stars. I just hate the wasted time.</review>

The worst dealership. My dad bought a used 2017 Chevy Volt 3 months ago and he has yet to receive his updated car registration and Plug-in Charger. Now, they refuse to answer his calls. Very unprofessional dealership and management is non-existent.

05/04/2021 Update:
Our salesman, Clement, reached out to ask for our address to ship the charger. We should hopefully be receiving it soon.
Time will tell if we get our updated/unexpired registration.< /review>

I was satisfied except when I went to drive away my panel had an error. I went back into the see the advisor and was told a they could not repair and was ordering a new panel yet I was not offered any documentation & im still waiting. The thing I was absolutely astonished by is that I’m wearing a mask as required and a man and a woman that were in the waiting room decided they were above the requirement. Not one worker asked them to put a mask on or to wait outside. I don’t want to wear a mask and yet I do. These righteous people should have been asked to leave- wait outside. There were several other people waiting and we all but these “special” people wouldn’t have it. Quite disgusted by they’re behavior and a bit upset that no one asked them to step outside<//Text>

<Text>We purchased a used CRV for our son. We worked with Bianca as a sales person, who was great. She communicated with us regularly over email at first, and was was great to work with in person as well. Our only issue was when it came down to the paperwork and financing. The man that helped us with this was SUPER friendly at first. Then he became extremely pushy about offering us warranties and service contracts. We told him no the first time, and he kept pushing it.  We again told him we were not interested at all.  He went back into his office and came back out again with a revised offer. We again told him no, and his whole demeanor completely changed once he realized we weren’t going to go for it. We have bought many cars in the past, and we most often do not sign up for these extras. We have never, ever had someone react the way this guy didn’t. We can only assume it’s because it’s such a large auto group. We will only be purchasing from privately owned dealerships from now on. It was ridiculously rude.</Text>< Pics>

I was totally impressed with the purchasing experience at Autonation honda. Erek and his co-workers were straightforward and attentive.  There was no pressure which was totally refreshing.  Our pre-owned explorer has a 90 day or 4,000 miles full warranty built into a no haggle price. After much research we found our price to be very good.  We really couldnt be happier which is quite a statement compared to some of our experiences at other dealerships. My Parents also had a great experience buying from autonation honda.<//text>

The service part needs more training and better customer service skills.

Aj is excellent... Very patient and made car shopping experience  pleasant.

Only downside is the sales talk on unnecessary warranty and insurance,  feels like you're obliged to get all of them.  Next day request for cancellation was not made possible.<//Text><date>1615349390371</date><Pictures>None< /Pictures><gmapID>0x809b1f8cb7689c85:0xfd027cebb953408< /gmapID></record>

Honda sales service and repair service and roadside assistance is terrible I wouldn’t even give 1 star but have to give my rating.

For the roadside assistance I sat for 4 hours on side of hwy 24 in Oakland they would not tow me because they said it was too dangerous they told me to call 911 and the police escorted me off the fwy where I had to drive which ruined my low profile tires. I had to pay for towing and then wait 4 months to be reimbursed. After many attempts to phone and could never reach anyone to talk to me. They only pay $100 max for roadside assistance so beware of that my bill was $112.50.

For repairs two spark plugs cracked. They did cover that with warranty, only if it wasn’t caused by the driver themselves. At this point I only have 43,000 miles on the car.
My next ordeal with the engine was it took 3 days for Honda to find out that fluid leaked into the engine causing the head gasket to crack. The car itself didn’t show any warning lights that the car was over heating or breaking down.All of this at 43,000 miles on it. My bill is 5 thousand dollars to replace the gasket.
The low profile tire warranty only works on the damaged tire and not the rest of the tires that got damaged in the process of a flat.

All of these problems combined for a 2019 Honda Accord with low mileage is absolutely absurd and the reason we got this car was for its reliability.. now we realize these are no longer reliable.</text>

Through  the whole process, sales associate  Emmanuel Palomo was on top of the game. His customer's service was excellent. Thank you.</Review>< pictures>

I appreciate Nick's professionalism and dedication to get the job done. I will definitely use Honda Roseville Services in the future along with purchasing new vehicles. Thank you Nick, Bunna, and the Honda Roseville Team for a great experience. From a dedicated and loyal Honda buyer.</Review>

The lowest price and the best customer service. Nothing but good things to say about Emmanuel. He was patient, honest, and really listened to what I needed. If you are in the market for a Honda. Don’t hesitate to ask for Emmanuel or his manager Mike By The Way.. haha (I even came out of this car buying experience with an inside joke. Says a lot about this place in my book).< /Text>

< Review>
Very dishonest and inconsistent. A vehicle on their website I was looking to purchase was listed as new. The sales associate and the manager both agreed to a price. Another manager stepped in and said that it's actually a used vehicle and they can't agree to that price due to it being a used vehicle. I have the emails stating the agreed to price. The website and app still say it's a new vehicle. Very dissatisfied with this experience and how they weren't willing to honor what was agreed to. If in the end this is how they treat customers, it's not a place you want to take your business to.</Review>

Kristy LaFleur worked with us on the purchase of my daughter's Honda Civic.  She was honest and extremely helpful.  It is our second Honda from AutoNation Honda Roseville, but Kristy made this round a much better experience.

Finance, on the other hand, needs to better understand the word "no"!  We were forced to "strongly" decline four times for the same product (he kept coming back with new ways to finance/bury it, but I didn't care about better ways to spread the financing of a product I did no want).   The fact is,  I could have written a check for the whole purchase, but this was a cosign to help my daughter, who is getting started as a teacher, to build her own credit and eventually do it on her own.

SO, I GIVE KRISTY 5 STARS, but a 4 overall, because they really need to ensure that their finance folks, who REALLY want to push their add-on products, respect the decisions and intelligence of the customer (for me, due to my business and love for cars, I have bought or leased over a dozen cars in the last 10 years, I actually do know what I want and need).

In summary, I will go back for Kristy (likely in the next year or so), but I will discuss the ground rules for finance with the GM before any transaction.  I advise others, who do not want some of the high mark-up products pushed by Finance, to do the same!

Thanks again, Kristy!<//Text>

Car buying has always been such a stressful thing for me.  My experience with AutoNation Honda was the complete opposite!  I told them what I was looking for, they found it, and gave me a good price.  It was quick and easy!  Shoutout to Mason (best salesman ever, ask for him)  Eddy (sales manager) and Tim (finance) for making this process not only easy but enjoyable! I love my new CRV!< /review>

I recently bought a 2017 Honda accord sport in December made the mistake of making my partner (now ex) the co-owner, the sales rep failed to mention anything about a "and or car title" so while I was at work without my knowledge my ex sold the car back to Honda 1/15/2021 and was able to get themselves a new car. I made the first car payment the day it was sold back to them and did not get a refund for the payment I made. I don't know why anyone would agree or want to do a "and or" car title. On top of that I used my own money and traded in my old vehicle for the Honda. Just a huge slap in the face now I have no car, I have to uber to work and start from square one to save another vehicle. Thanks Honda.<//Text>

I purchased a new vehicle and set an appointment to have the sealant applied and was told by the sales department I would be provided a ride home  while it's being done.  When I dropped the vehicle off at the service department they told me they do not provide transportation and not being able to get a ride I walked home. No offer of a courtesy vehicle, either.  This is the lobby, btw.  I'd called ride sharing service & was given $41-50 quotes on a less than 5 mile ride. Does this mean I'll have to plan on spending $100 on transportation any time I leave my vehicle there to be serviced?<//text>

I had purchased a battery a few years ago, and just recently had trouble with it again.  I dropped off my car in the middle of the night, and received a call the next morning that my car had a new battery and I could could come pick up the car—no need to mention that I purchased the last battery from them...when I went to pick it up, there was a zero balance bill.
Service was great...will continue to use them ;)</review>

<Text>I would give negative stars if I could. I have a 2021 Honda Pilot and the transmission went out. When I called to make an appointment the woman in the service department was so rude and basically told me "good luck." Over 6 errors came on and my children and I were stranded on the side of a very busy road until my husband came to get us. Honda Roadside was  no help whatsoever. We were promised 1 hour at most and we waited over 4 in my husband's car. We purchased not 1 but 2 brand new vehicles from Honda because we thought we were getting a new reliable vehicle and our experience has been ridiculous. I will NEVER give my business to this establishment or company again. Total joke that put my whole family at risk.<//Text>< pictures>

<Pictures>None</Pictures><text>My husband & I normally take my car to Honda Yuba City, but my husband is deployed & I wanted  hot orange chicken from Prime Wok (so good).

My appointment was on a Friday morning and pulling up, I knew I was going to be there a while. There were rows upon rows of cars. I did end up being there for double the quoted time, so I kind of wish I asked for a loaner or something.

Anyways! The five stars is for Isaiah. He was incredibly friendly and personable. The gentleman we usually see in Yuba City could learn a thing or two from him.

I am generally very uncomfortable going to auto places. When I'm with my husband, I'm ignored (not even a nod of acknowledgement in my direction). When I'm alone, the condescension is laid on thick. Not nice.

Do I know anything about cars? No. Would I appreciate your transparency and thoroughness? Yes.

I digress. Isaiah, amazing. Please give him a big fat bonus come Christmas time.

My only complaint was that I wish someone checked in on me at least once an hour, even if there wasn't an update. I was really bored! Haha.<//text>< date>

Great place to buy a car and get service.

Everyone is helpful and kind. Decent prices.
Only negative is they force you to up buy a tint and floor mat package which balloons the cost unexpectedly at signing.<//Text>

I like the one-price strategy - car was about $1000 less than similar cars for sale near San Francisco. Sales process took too long - 3 hours after we said we wanted to buy the car, even though we were paying by personal check and AutoNation has automated check verification software.  Finance manager still tried to sell a extended warranty product that would double the price of the car - on an electric car that needs very little maintenance.<//Review>< Pics>

< review>
Usually, I love my visits to automation honda Roseville. I went in to buy the car I had leased; I believe my experience was below their usual standards. I told him I wanted to purchase my lease and he asked if I remembered what it said the purchase price was on the website. I said I didn’t know what it said my payout cost was for on my car (which it said on the website where I make payments, I just didn’t know off the top of my head.) He said that was fine and he could look it up. When I got home, I checked the website saw they charged me $500 more than it said the payout cost was. I called my advisor back and he said he would take care of it and never did. My advisor was cool but not the best, especially because I’m out $500 for no reason. The guy that try’s to upsell you on all the warranty’s was TERRIBLE. As soon as he realized I didn’t want anything extra his attitude changed negatively. He was then rude; rushing me to sign a bunch of papers and pushing me out of the door. I left not knowing how to pay my new car payment and all of what I had really signed. I started getting a bunch of junk mail for insurance on my “new car”. He somehow had me sign something that would release my information to advertisers and signed up for junk mail. I signed like over 20 times and when I was asking him what it was for he was vague and was rushing me. This is the first absolutely terrible experience I’ve had here. (This was my second 3 year lease from here.) Yes, I went in and left with what I wanted (I wanted to purchase my lease), but I ended up being charged $500 more, signed up for junk mail and not feeling like a valued customer.< /review>

Purchased 2020 Honda Accord EX_L 1.5T White.  Worked with Peter online and phone before driving 200 miles.  Peter was upfront from the start and everything was as he quoted.  While waiting for the paperwork at the dealership, Peter made sure the car was ready to go for our trip home.  They have plenty of cars, great pricing and everything happened as I was told over the phone and emails.  The car is great. We wanted gas mileage priority, technology and creature comforts.  I think we got a good car that does all three.  Note:  It is 4 stars because they were a little slow processing the paperwork and we sat for hours.  Otherwise it was a good experience.

Had to wait for over 2 hours for the oil change to be complete, even though we had a scheduled appointment. If we had known they were expecting it to take that long, we would have made other arrangements, rather than waiting at the dealership for so long, thinking that any minute it would be ready.</text>

<rating>1<//rating><Review>Bad customer experience. I went to Honda Autonation 230 Automall Dr.  in Roseville, did all the qualifying paperwork, with a trade-in and received the bait and switch. I had been corresponding with Anna prior to my visit, I met with a salesman Peter  Sobczak  at her request. I test drove an 2013 Accord, the salesmen told me financing is easier with a new car- more options he said. I test drove a 2020 Accord that I loved, with assurances from him that he would meet my monthly payment budget, we set down. He presented me with a two hundred dollar increase above my budget, and said I lied about the condition of my trade in on line, he then offered me two thousand dollars LESS than our agreed upon trade-in amount. This wasn’t the only issues with the appointment, but the worst of it.
My husband and I promptly walked across the street to Roseville Toyota. I received 5,100 for my trade-in, 3000. More than they offered me, and I found a beautiful Camry within my monthly budget with no outlandish deception.
I will never be back, and if anyone asks my opinion!?@!?!. Never again.< /Review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

Autonation, Roseville's Honda Dealer, was awesome. I bought a used car with only one key which was laser cut and transponder. The closest dealer was Yuba City Honda which quoted me $240.  Roseville did it for $159. Definitely worth the drive. 5 stars.<//text>

< Review>
I was helping my parents shop for their new car and this dealership has been the easiest dealership I've ever talked to or worked with. There have been so many dealerships that always give me the run around and always try their hardest from giving me the actual OTD price of a car. And even then the price they give me doesn't reflect their dealership add ons or accessories.. Makes it a complete waste of time in my honest opinion. AutoNation Honda Roseville was nothing but quick and honest when I asked them for an OTD price of the car I was looking at. I was in contact with Angela at about 3:30pm. She told me everything I needed and set me up an appointment for my parents and I by 4pm. Angela was very kind and she even waited another hour from the time she was off work just to be able to greet us and to introduce us to the associate that would be helping us! Josh was also extremely helpful and was the easiest sales associate that I have ever worked with. He was always constantly checking up on us as we waited for our paperwork and kept us updated at all times. He was also able to work with their manager in getting us a great deal to keep us satisfied! Matthew and Bianca helped my parents with their financial paper work and were also amazing! They gave awesome insight on information for the car and were great in giving us their honest opinions on things about the car. Matthew as well gave us a great add on our additional packages! Can't say it enough on how great the team of Ashley, Eddy, Josh, Matthew, and Bianca were.  Thank you for your amazing help and for giving my parents an amazing experience on purchasing their brand new Honda civic hatchback! With no doubt will be recommending them to friends and family! Keep up the awesome work and I hope you enjoy the Gift basket we ordered for you guys!<//Review>

<Time>1613000992476</Time><review>Horrible experience today. Bought the new car here for my mom and planned to service it here as it is convenient for her to bring it in when needed. It is due for 15k miles service so I brought it in and Jonathan O in service department was supposed to help answer any service related questions, a simple B16 service needed. So I asked one question and he replied “they do not service hondas based on their service manuals” which triggered me to immediately start asking questions on how that would affect my car warranty. He did not like me questioning his “expertise” and became defensive and rude for pointing out service manual recommendations. I wasn’t able to finish asking any other questions as he kept interrupting me over and over again giving me the run around I already heard from him. On 2nd attempts to same question to get a clear answer from him he kept attacking me saying I’m not listening to him when in fact he was not allowing me to ask full questions for him to understand my concerns in the 1st place. Rude and unprofessional. This leave me thinking what my mom would of had to deal with if she was to take the car in today, very concerning.
No I wouldn’t recommend Jonathan’s services to anyone. Wasted my time here today.<//review>< gmap_id>

<userid>101012430419011442773<//userid><Name>Kevin Davies</Name><Date>1598377372941</Date><Rate>4< /Rate><Review>I visited the dealership several times and test drove several vehicles over a period of six weeks. I compared the Honda CRV with other cars such as the Mazda CX 5 and the Toyota RAV 4.  I spent hours reading reviews and watching You Tube videos. All of these cars are similar in size and performance and each have good features. I finally picked a new CRV EX.  It has all the features I need. Just enough comfort and it is practical for our camping trips and weekend hikes with plenty of cargo space.  The dealership was not pushy and they are familar with the specifications of their vehicles.  I am probably what they would consider a difficult customer pushing down the price at every opportunity and not buying any of the extra warranties or protection plans, but they were patient and polite during the whole process.  Be prepared to spend 3 hours signing documents.  Overall a good experience and time will tell if I made the right choice..</Review>< Pics>

Autonation Honda Roseville exceeded my expectations when I brought my vehicle in for a safety recall. Isaiah Mitchell was outstanding and provided the most excellent customer service! He met me with a smile, helped me right away, and went above and beyond. I cannot thank him enough! He will definitely be my service consultant every time!</Text>

I searched far and wide for Tahoe in the range of 2015 to 2017 and being very particular as to who I would be dealing with.  I couldn't be happier having selected AutoNation Honda in Roseville for a couple of reasons. Cole, my salesman, was very accommodating by allowing be to take the car to my mechanic for two days without even a down payment. When we  decided to buy the Tahoe we did all the paperwork outside under their tent because of the whole Covid 19 business and the entire staff of AutoNation Honda were respectful of our desire to avoid close contact.
There were no gotchas, misunderstands, or problems at all with the deal. It was a very pleasant buying experience with zero problems. I absolutely would go back to Cole and AutoNation for my next car purchase.</text>

I had a wonderful experience on my visit for my monthly car service.. The 1st time I was pleased with my whole service. I was greeted upon my arrival by Isaiah
He was so polite, friendly, and welcoming..I had an appt with another tech who was busy but Isaiah took me in right away got all my questions answered and service needs taken care of.. I appreciate his excellent customer service by making the appt seem so easy he had great conversation as well as efficiency!!< /Text>

<Text>My father and I went to trade in an older vehicle and purchase a new Honda 2020 CR-V AWD last week. We had the pleasure of working with Emmanuel Palomo. Emmanuel was the absolute best and really worked with us to get the best deal. I would recommend anyone looking for a new vehicle to request Emmanuel as you can tell he really cares about his customers, is knowledgable about the products, and overall makes the car-buying experience a positive one.

The facility itself was spacious, clean and organized.</Text>< Pics>

Great place to take your vehicle. I recently had to download the latest GPS from Garmin. I have downloaded the past few years with no issues. This year I downloaded and the GPS wouldn’t upload it on to the device in my car. I contacted Autonation Honda. They initially said this kind of work costs around $750. Jonny O’Connell called me back after the initial estimate and said they are waving the fee. The tech worked with Garmin support for over 3 hours and were able to update my system. All that for free. Thank you very much!!!</review>

<review>Yes and no. lol I have had great experiences here, however, I would like to also acknowledge ways in which they can be better.

PRO:
A few years ago, they were ESSENTIAL and incredibly HELPFUL when a Shell gas station employee left two oil rags in my gas valve after doing work on my car. My car would stop while driving ON THE FREEWAY and it was scary. After having it towed to Roseville Honda, they took apart my car, found the problem, sent me pictures of the problem, and backed me when I approached Shell and told them they caused the problem and would like them to compensate me for the tow fees and the service provided by Honda. I felt reassured with the service team having my back.

CON:
I just bought a used car and believe I was definitely underpaid for my trade-in. My car's trade-in value was worth a minimum of ~$5,500 and a maximum of ~$9,000. I was offered $2,900 (after they deducted ~$400 for some scratches). I was disappointed that I couldn't come in with my baseline price and that there was NO OPTION to negotiate. I wasn't happy with the trade-in price. I was undervalued. My car had new headlamps and headlights that were installed a month prior (~$400). It did have more mileage than cars traditionally have for its age, however, I regularly maintained it. I feel confident they will resell my car for ~$10 or $12,000. When I asked for a rubric on how they price out the car, I was told they had a "guy in Florida" who evaluates it. I wanted to ask about this process and get him on the phone to negotiate, however, it was late and I felt bad for the skeleton crew who was working that day.

PRO:
The salesperson who helped me was flexible and accommodating. I needed to change my appointment time twice and he was flexible and fit me in (despite being quite busy that day). MAJOR APPRECIATION to him grabbing a few items from my car after it sold. The night I bought the car, I was driving home and remembered I forgot my Fastrak and garage door opener in the car I just sold. He was great and reassured me, saying he would grab it first thing in the morning and put it in a baggie on his desk. I came back the next day and received my stuff, no hassle.

CON:
The used car I bought was ADVERTISED as having a medical kit. It came with no kit. When I asked about it, I was told, "Oh, it must not be here." I wanted to negotiate the price down since it didn't have everything as advertised, however, I was told this was a "No hassle price." It was advertised with a medical kit. It doesn't have it. So adjust the price of the medical kit from the total price. lol

PRO:
They filled my new used-car's gas tank up with gas as a "thank you" for waiting 6 hours to complete our transaction (poor skeleton crew was SWAMPED).

CON:
There accounting guy . . . I'm not sure what his title is . . . But he was AGGRESSIVE. I didn't deal with him directly, but I overheard him BERATING an employee for, what sounded like, being unable to get info from someone. I thought his tone, level of voice, and choice of words were unprofessional and harmful to a productive work environment.

PRO:
I appreciate being told I was sixth in line with closing the deal with the finance guy. It allowed me to gauge and manage my time, so I went out to eat dinner to fill that empty time.<//review>< rate>

I had made an initial appointment for my car because there was a weird sound coming from the tires and I had no idea what was going on. My first appointment went fairly, I spent 4 hours waiting for the verdict and nothing was found. Everything was checked and nothing was found. I drove off and I still kept hearing the sound, so I was not happy. I made a follow-up appointment and to my luck I was designated with James Harding. He instantly made the entire experience better. I told him what happened and what I was hearing and he did what my last service advisor should have done, drive my car around to hear what I was hearing. I trusted him with my car and knew he would be the one to find out what the problem was. He called me later that day and explained what was wrong with my car and promised he would have it fixed. I received a call the next day that my car was good to go! I was thrilled that James knew exactly how to take on the issue and got the job done. Once it was time to pay the bill he also helped out so much on the financial end of things, given the current circumstances in the world, it was truly a blessing that I got James as my service advisor. I highly reccomend him to anyone and everyone needing help with their vehicles at Honda in Roseville, CA. He will definitely be the man I go to for my car from now on. Thank you James, you were wonderful!<//Text>

This is the second car I received  from this location.  I’ve had a great experience on both occasions. The only negative about this last visit was I was initially told my car would come with tinted windows but it did not. They had to drive my car from another location because I wanted a different color than the one they had but the car I received did not have tinted windows. Other than that I got a great deal on a brand new 2020 Honda Accord. I will/have recommended this location to many friends and family who are looking to purchase a Honda.< /Review>

The sale team was very patient with me as I looked for the best deal on my new car. Once I drove to site the car for ready for me to test drive. The first day onsite was very frustrating, as I waited for finance. So told them I was leaving and cancel the sales as I was ready to go. The sales manager told me it was fine the to leave and they hold the car for me until the next day. To make a long story short I was treated very well at Honda Roseville.

I purchased my very first car here at Honda, in Roseville and let me tell you the experience was great! I wasn’t pushed into anything I didn’t want, I was able to look at my options , even go home and come back the next day with my decision, and there was no Hassle at all from anyone there. Gabe was so very helpful and as well as Al Palmer; they both were able to find the car I wanted! I highly recommend Roseville Honda, and I can truly say I trust them.</Review>

<Text>It was an okay experience. We have been customers to Honda for over 10 years, and unfortunately we did not get Ray (the salesman we asked for).. the one we had, we felt rushed and the deal wasn't made until hours later. Next time I will just wait for Ray, or not get a car until I am comfortable with the salesman who helps my family and myself.< /Text><userid>109627286265320586099<//userid><rate>1< /rate>< pictures>

<Date>1611263634237<//Date><text>Horrible experience. My wife was dropped off at Enterprise rental where she was told they had no cars available. When I called Honda, they did nothing and didn’t seem to care. My wife walked home before going to her clinic to care for patients all day. Then, when I went to pick up the car, I stood at the cashier’s window for at least ten minutes, while various employees in Honda uniforms stood around and shared idle banter. This place offers the opposite end of the bell curve in service compared to Roseville Lexus. We will never go back there again. I will never buy a Honda and my wife won’t buy another car from Auto Nation. I hope no one at the hospital where I work, the fire agencies I work for or any friends or family ever experience the lousy service at Auto Nation Honda!< /text></record>

First off, I'm a tough grader. I have enough trips around the sun to know what good customer service should look like and when employees are properly trained and motivated to provide it.

I recently reviewed this dealership because I walked onto their lot while I was having my Infiniti serviced across the street. I was impressed that the people were pleasant and not the stereotypical "What will it take to get you into this car today?" sales-types.I was kinda sorta thinking of getting a newer Honda for my wife to drive.

A couple weeks later, I was looking for a pre-owned Honda CRV and at some point questioned whether a new close-out 2020 CRV might actually be closer to my price range than I initially thought. Used car prices on some models seem to be inflated and 2020 close-out prices are pretty hot. I had a very fair price on a new CRV in Stockton and actually had an appointment to go there to buy it. But I decided to check the price at AutoNation one more time, and am very glad that I did. They came in, on the exact same model, color, and trim about $2500 less than Stockton.

Actually, this made me feel a bit uneasy. Why so cheap? What am I missing? Is this for real? AutoNation is a HUGE outfit - is this really where I want to purchase a car? Are they going to stick it to me somewhere?

I made an appointment and reserved the car and held my breath. My wife and I showed up to see the car and were both somewhat tense. We haven't purchased a new car since 2007 and were not totally comfortable with how working with a huge dealership would work. Our sales guy was pleasant, but we never really understood what the sales process was and how long it would take, not having purchased a new car in well over a decade. Complicating this was that we wanted to register the car in the name of our revocable living trust, which seemed to gum up the works a bit for the financing.

To be honest, we were worn down after about 2 1/2 hours and despite my better judgment, I started signing documents without my usual eagle eye review. When I got home, I started reviewing the documents and realized that I had agreed to some additional warranties that I didn't want and that the financing rate I thought I was getting was not there... I had agreed to a six year financing term when I wanted five year. Oh Great Scott! Now what?

I called the dealership, reached the finance fellow and we met four days after taking possession of the car - and resolved *everything* to my complete satisfaction. He could not have been more accommodating to my requests.

What would have earned AutoNation my highest rating?

Well, it would have been helpful to explain to us what the sales process was going to be. Not everyone purchases a new car every year and we made it clear that we hadn't gone through this in nearly fourteen years. Sort of a simple explanation of "Here's how we will process this sale" step-by-step would have been nice. We were presented numbers that sounded like we were done before we even met the finance guy. And then, the extended warranty information was presented very quickly and, again, we were worn down and didn't push for explanations that could have been more clearly presented to us. Not totally the fault of AutoNation - actually more on us... but they could have presented things more clearly.

But we walked away with a very nice deal on a new car and are totally satisfied that we achieved the correct financing terms with a very honest and reputable car dealership. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend AutoNation Roseville to a friend or neighbor. long, but the people are friendly and actually listen. What a concept: listening to customers!< /review>

I didn’t expect to be leaving with a new car, I was just coming in for an oil change! Great service all around, from the service department to the finance manager to the sales person. I recommend coming here if you want to have people who are knowledgeable of the ins and outs of car buying and will help you make a decision that doesn’t feel like you lost out at all! I will be recommending to my family and friends!<//Review>

Have been bringing my cars into service for a while now and there’s only one person that makes it all worth it. Sam is the man, he goes above and beyond to make sure my car is always taken care of. I bought my car from Folsom lake Honda and I even have the service paid in advance but they’re service is terrible. I drive another 30 minutes to come by and see Sam and have him take care of my car. 5 star excellent service!<//review>

<review>Rich is a super good service manager. I just had a great experience at Honda Roseville Automall service center. My 2014 minivan was having transmission problems known in a service bulletin. Rich knew exactly what to do. They fixed it right away at no charge. It runs perfectly now. Rich is very courteous and gives clear, full explanations about every detail of your car's status.

This is my second experience with AutoNation Honda. Ray Turner was beyond exceptional and friendly! He did the work to get me into the car I wanted at a price I could afford. Marie in the service department was above and beyond amazing as well!

The level of customer care and attention was what you would expect at a mom and pop shop you've been going to for years! Well done!<//Review>

I went to the dealership just to look at what used Hondas were available. I did not intend on purchasing a vehicle that day but then I found exactly what I was looking for. The sales representative Peter Sobczak was nice, helpful, and wanted to make sure I found something that I liked. And Wesley Stewart helped me with the documents. The process only took a few hours and it ran smoothly. I left the lot with a nice Honda!!<//Review>

<date>1593287826795< /date><Rate>4</Rate><Review>Everyone was very nice and knowledgeable. The process was virtually quick and pain free. I feel like i got a very fair price on the vehicle. I was very happy with my experience. The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because they did a poor job detailing the vehicle. There were quite a few spots they missed and I had to ask them to go over again and I found a hair covered gumdrop candy.. And then i didn't pull the sun visors down until I left after purchasing , and the drivers side visor was absolutely filthy, literally foundation makeup caked onto the mirror cover and black makeup smudges all over the cloth. So that part was disappointing since this was my very first vehicle purchase I was really looking forward to it being clean and fresh.< /Review>< pics>

<Text>Went to get one of my free oil changes in my 2015 honda civic. I was at 5,000 miles and I had driven across the country. Man who checked me in immediately told me I needed at least two new tires as mine were 5 years old, and insisted also that I did not need an oil change. When I corrected him and said "No, I actually bought all new tires 2 years ago, before my move across the country."  He insisted I was wrong and I must have only bought two, and was extremely pushy about me buying new tires.

Overall, I felt that I was targeted for aggressive sales tactics because I was a woman and wouldn't know anything about cars. Will not be returning to this autonation location.< /Text>< user>

Jimmie Le noticed that a special code had showed up where it says you need service. He felt it would be a good idea to spend a little more money and check out everything, including belts and fluids and a lot of extra stuff besides just the oil change. It was reassuring to know that everything was in good condition and we wouldn't need anything major done for another16,000 miles. Since I drive less than 5,000 mile a year that should last us for some time. Again, great service. We wouldn't take our car anywhere else.</review><pictures>None</pictures><Response>{'time': 1589311553035, 'text': 'Hubert, thank you for your kind review; we are happy to pass along your comments to the team here at AutoNation Honda Roseville!

Sami the advisor is gem of a person. Initially I didn't like that I had to wait as he was attending another customer but once started attending me, we just clicked. He hall me understanding the Tyre warranty plan, my service plans, etc.</text>

We are moving out of the State, and we needed our car checked out for the trip. As always, we came to AutoNation to check our car for the trip.
The Staff were attentive, friendly and professional, and a Shuttle vehicle was instantly available to take me home & later return me to the Dealer.
Items were found, one major, and fixed promptly.
We will miss our friends, especially Sami, who has personally assisted me with car needs for years.</review>

<Review>When I first started my investigation into buying a hybrid car I was uncertain as to which manufacturer and model?  After doing my due diligence I decided on a Honda Insight.  Checking several websites I had an idea on the estimated cost I was willing to pay.  By going through the Costco Auto Program I just want to know what I could expect to pay for the car.  Within minutes of my inquiry AutoNation Honda got back to me and gave me a price that was better than I expected.  I decided then that I would pursue my car quest with AutoNation Honda with a backup plan that since I did not commit to buy the car from them I could pursue offers from other Honda dealers.  That backup plan fell apart after meeting with the sales staff at AutoNation Honda.  They made the experience of buying a car from them so painless and enjoyable (Yes, that's right!  Buying a car can be enjoyable.) that I did not pursue the backup plan.  Needless to say, I'm extremely happy with my car and AutoNation Honda.<//Review><userid>115590348002426090836< /userid>< date>

<rating>5</rating><Text>This was my first time at this dealership. We went there to possibly buy my son a new car. He wanted a Honda Insight. Garry Neighbors was our sales person. He knew the car and took his time to make us feel comfortable and explain the features of this car. He was professional and did his best to expedite the process.

We then worked with Matt in finance. Matt worked to get my son the best rate he could given that he was a first time buyer. No hard sell or pressure. He explained a few things and we were in and out pretty quickly once all the paperwork was done.

If you are looking for a Honda I would recommend working with Garry and Matt in finance.< /Text>< Pictures>

Had an oil change and a tire rotation in the service center and I was there for almost 2.5 hours (8:15am -10:40am) and they ended up damaging my car. The individual helping me was friendly and the other staff was friendly as well, but due to the wait time and the fact that now my car needs to be fixed I will never go here again. I would always go to the Ken Garff Honda Dealership in Salt Lake for service when I lived in Utah and they were fast, friendly, and I never had any issues with the car. Unfortunately, the Autonation Honda Roseville did not compare at all.<//review>

She exceeded my expectations for the service department. She came out right away to check me in, understood all of my needs, got me settled in for my wait in the showroom. Her estimate of 90 minutes was spot on! And Honda actually beat that by a few minutes. She put my mind at ease, but made no specific promises. I felt like I was in good hands. And she was super nice - great customer service skills. I couldn't say better things about her. She even got my glasses out of my vehicle - which I forgot to get.<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

Tim was great. Very professional, friendly, and went above and beyond. Really appreciate his service and he really made this transaction a smooth and enjoyable process for my mom and I. Went in with low expectations and Tim exceed them. He did not pressure us to add anything and stuck withe the prices we agreed on. Tim also offered a one month follow up and will help my mom and I with any additional tech questions we have. We are lucky to have him as our sales assistant.< /review>

Recently went there on Saturday a couple of days before labor Monday to buy a CRV. We looked a few outside our self, once decided we like the car went ahead approached a salesman name Peter. He told us he had one outside and a couple different models inside to have a look to decide about trim and color. As soon as we walked in, lady at the reception, who in COVID-19 season wasn’t wearing any mask and having her lunch right in the middle of reception, gave us not so welcoming looks but we ignored it at first and carried on. While Peter showing us around, lady looked at us and yelled at Peter really pointing at us that he brought us in. She then carried on making numerous inappropriate gestures towards us and giving peter hand signals to just push us out. Peter who was helping at first felt a little agitated at that point. We wanted to test drive and buy a different color but we simply just decided to leave the premises and not make any more trouble for Peter as well. Its surprising that you can’t give your customers 10-15 minutes to make a decision to spend 30-35 grands. After that we went straight to Honda Mel Rapton, thanks to their customer service and willingness to help, bought a brand new CRV from there. Still a big thank you to Peter, who was trying to help and surely would have made a sale if he wasn’t bothered by crazy reception lady and left alone to do his job.< /Review>

I went in for a 'first' check up since buying my new car (at another Honda dealership) at 1,000 miles. My Honda "service agent" was Michael, who was friendly, professional and took care of BUSINESS! I went in there because I had good service there before (and I appreciate Randy for that).  He guided me through the process. Took care of me immediately. Yeah, immediately. That was an incredible experience. Thank you to Roseville Honda and Michael Burke!</review>

Sam is the absolute best!  I bought a CRV from Folsom Honda and the battery died while I was at the store the next day. I had it jumped and came right over to the Roseville dealership.It is close to my home. Sam explained what the problem most likely was. It was exactly what he explained. The battery tested great. Most likely it had not been driven much recently.He explained it might be 1 -2 hour. It was actually only about 30 minutes!  He was incredibly  knowledgeable. He took the time to explain a lot of things the Salesmen did not which I am very grateful for. I never felt rushed or insignificant because I did not have an appointment. Sam is an important assist to this dealership.
I will continue to use Roseville Honda as MY dealership and I tell everyone to go see SAM!
The lobby is very comfortable and the coffee is good also!
Thanks  SAM!!</Text>

<Rate>5<//Rate><text>AutoNation Honda in Roseville went ABOVE and beyond to make my vehicle purchase 100% hassle free and friendly. I received a warm welcome the second I got there! I had been researching and test driving cars for months to find the best fit for me at a price point I could afford. Once I decided on the 2020 Honda Civic, I instantly got a great quote from the team at AutoNation. Their response time and cooperation was consistent and fast! Buying a car is a huge investment and often very stressful, but all the stars aligned for me throughout the process. I definitely got their A Team working with Emmanuel, the Sales manager Al, and Jeff in Finance. I felt like every aspect of my purchase was important to them, not like I was just another customer (even though they were relatively busy that evening). Since I had done my research and worked out numbers before hand, I was able to go in, test drive the car, and finish all of the paperwork very efficiently. I was assured that with COVID-19 protocol, everything was sanitized for my safety. The team I dealt with were relatable and not pushy at all. They were all knowledgeable and answered all of my questions! Emmanuel configured my vehicle settings while I met with finance, and showed me every nook and cranny of the vehicle and how all of the buttons worked before I left. Even with the social distancing protocol, they made me feel right at home. Once social distancing orders are all over, I will have to go back and get my official handshakes! Every sign pointed to this purchase and I look forward to a long term relationship with my new Honda, Esther!</text>< pics>

<Time>1498715662742<//Time><review>I am a first time car buyer and I have to say that I had a great experience at AutoNation Honda Roseville specifically because the sales consultant that assisted me, Michael Lazzara was genuine, helpful and patient throughout my car shopping experience. I appreciated that I didn’t feel pressured to come out with a car and that all my questions were answered in a truthful manner. Being a first time car buyer I was nervous as buying a car was a big step and I was worried that I wouldn’t get a good deal because of my inexperience, Michael however guided me through this journey. After I finished signing all the paper work, it was already late and past the closing time, and because all the workers had gone home for the day, Michael was left to wash and detail my brand new 2017 Honda Civic which had just arrived that same day. Michael made my first car buying experience a great one. :)< /review>< name>

On March 1st I brought my Honda in for what I thought was a free fix of my air conditioning. Richard said it would be about 3 hours so I should take the shuttle.  I did receive the bad news that it wasn't covered.   Somehow Richard was able to get me a discount approved by his boss.  Afterward he said the shuttle would pick me up. I have a  horrible time driving in the dark and it was getting to that point and Richard greeted the driver by saying "do you have Candace? She can't drive in the dark.  I felt like I was his only customer  He got me going before dark!  What a delightful man he is.  You should be proud you have him as an employee.

Sincerely,

Candace Flynn</Review>

<Name>Reginald Gist</Name><GmapID>0x809b1f8cb7689c85:0xfd027cebb953408<//GmapID><pics>None< /pics><Text>I inquired about a used 2019 Honda Accord Sport 2.0t/6spd manual. Went thru the entire process to purchase the vehicle. Got payment information and was even going to set up delivery for the car to my home in South Carolina because the sales manager only gave me until this weekend to purchase the vehicle. I I was about to book my flight to California to come pick the car up this weekend when I was that told that someone was interested in the vehicle. Mind you, I had already been told by not just the sales manager, Brian, but by the sales associate Ann, via text that the car was on hold pending my follow up on pre-approval for financing thru Capital One. I was also told that someone else in Michigan was considering the car.Later I received a text message from Anna stating that the person who was coming in to look at the car backed out. I then asked her if she could move forward with me purchasing the car, even after I had basically been given the run around about it being on "hold" and being lied to and told that the car wasn't on hold for me per se..but just on hold. If its not on "hold" for me, and its available to anybody what's the point of telling me its on "hold pending sale by this weekend" Just a pack of lies.  After some back and forth about getting the car sold, I was basically told that the deal wouldn't work for the dealership and that they were going to cancel the deal because of "how I wanted the deal" structured. Listen, I sold cars for a while, I know how this business works. The point is they didn't want to sell me the vehicle because they didn't want to have to put in the work to get it moved out of state. They didn't want to deal with the paperwork, the whole process and if that's the case they could have told me this last night or this morning.  Brian and Anna should have just told me all of this before they ran my credit  and adding an inquiry and had me almost book a non-refundable flight to California to pick up a car that they tried to purposely sell from under me.  I was ORIGINALLY told by the sales associate, Anna, that they could possibly hold the car up until October 3. This morning I was told I'd have to purchase the car by this weekend. By the end of tonight I was basically told that I couldn't buy the car at all. This is NOT the way you treat a customer, especially one who was willing to fly thousands of miles to buy a car from you. I have no respect for this dealership, the sales manager or the sales person. I intend to file a complaint. I can get over not getting the car,  I can always get another one some other time, what I can't get over is the way I was treated. I have never treated any of my customers the way I was treated today.  I do not recommend this dealership or any dealership with practices like this one.< /Text><user_id>110048191434633285785< /user_id>< Rate>

I was greeted upon arrival even though I couldn't be addressed right away. I was taken inside out of the cold, given coffee and an estimated time of completion.
When it was finished I was told of future maintenance that was needed and was sent on my way in a timely fashion. Randy was clear and concise and very freindly.</text>

Overall great experience! If you are going to roseville auto mall ask for Rich!!< /text>

I came to your facility after realizing that other Toyota dealers will not honor AutoNation contracts.  I noticed your signs of "AutoNation" Honda, Chrysler, etc. across the street  I walked into Chrysler Dealership and was treated courteously but directed to other AutoNation dealers when I see that they had a long service line.  I visited Subaru dealer and met with two ladies, one was Lacey, and the other's name I forgot, but they were equally helpful.  I was told of next day service for they have no Camry filter in stock.

Disappointed in the service department. Went in to get a service and detailing on my car, both inside and out. She upgraded me to the Clorox disinfectant because I work in the medical field. I paid for it. 3hrs later my car was ready. Went in and paid for it while they were getting my car. No one walked me back to my car for inspection, which I shrugged off because of the pandemic and social distancing. They were also leaving for lunch after I was all set. I got to my car and it wasn’t what I expected. The inside was still dusty and had footprints inside. The outside it looked like I had grease wiped on my doors. There was bird poop still on the outside. As if they had just hosed it off. I gave them a half an hour to eat their lunch. I called them and left them a message. This was almost a week ago now. Today an email was sent to me to write a review of my service with them. I said what I’m saying now. They said they would have someone contact me in regards to this immediately. I work in healthcare during this pandemic and it was hard enough to get a scheduled appt due to my schedule being out of control. I do not have the time to go back there to receive the service I asked and paid for the first time. It’s disappointing to me.< /Text>

<Rating>3</Rating><Review>I rate the service 3 stars. The work performed was great so far, however while I know I’m not their only customer, it would be nice to get status updates once in awhile. I had to call a few times and wait for them to get back to me. It’s not like I have another vehicle to drive while they take their sweet time fixing mine, I’ve got to plan accordingly and I can’t do that very well without good information. I’d even take text updates. Hopefully they get it together in the future.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures><Response>{'time': 1579729294642, 'text': "Michael, thank you for taking the time to leave us feedback.

I called the service department and was put on hold which was expected.  An automated response the asked if I would like to leave a message and someone would call me back..later in the day, after no response, I sent a message via google asking why no one had called me and received responses from two separate individuals who said they'd take my info down and forward it to their service department...its been 24 hours now and no response...I ended up calling Folsom Lake Honda and gentlemen called me back within 1 hour</review>

Sam was a very nice guy, great customer service & explained things that were going on. I give him 5 stars for that  However, like at a restaurant, I didn't wanna get irritated with the messenger Sam, the service too way too long.  I called ahead and had a scheduled 330 appointment oil change.  I left Honda at 630 pm!!!!  I live an hour away. I came into Roseville with a coupon but typically go to Yuba City Honda as it's closer. I was not a happy camper about the time. I was not told it would take that long. If I had known, I would not have come to this location.<//Text>

When I came back to get my car it again was slow. The young lady helping me was fine at first. When I stood there for a while I asked her as she walked by if my service guy was coming.  She seemed to be inconvenienced by my asking. When she came back with the paper work she again was visibly irritated. She got back to me handed me my copy of the paperwork and I asked if I had to sign something and she says it's right here I'm getting it. She went to call someone to pull my car out, I told her I didn't need it since I seen it when I pulled in, and honestly i didn't want to wait again. No thank you no anything she handed me my keys and walked away. I believe her name was Kaylin.< /Review><pics>None< /pics><response>{'time': 1583200951951, 'text': 'Shelly, we are deeply disappointed by your experience at AutoNation Honda Roseville.

Very friendly and quick to get me in. I like that they use the Clorox misting system to clean out the inside of the car.
I knew they were honest because I gave them pre-authorization to change the air filter and they said, No, your filter is fine when I picked up the car.
Very happy with the person taking my appointment and especially Jimmi Le, the service advisor< /text>

I had a coupon for $199 for brakes.  Unfortunately this did not cover the replacement of routers.  I was stunned that the cost was well over $500.  Jimmy did give me a 15% discount.  I had purchased a new.key bob because mine died.  Jimmy took care of programming for me even though not purchased there.  That was nice.<//Text>

<Review>Emily was great. The only issue I had was when I first pulled in a guy came out to help me. He held up a sign to the window for Emily and placed it on my windshield. I waited about 15 minutes watching as people pulled around me for their service appointments. Just when I was about to get out of my car to see what was taking so long, Emily came out of the building. She apologized saying she did not know I was there. Apparently waving the sign with her name on it did not work as she did not see it. Not sure that's the best way to let the techs know their customer is waiting.

After that, all went smoothly and I was well taken care. of.</Review><gmapID>0x809b1f8cb7689c85:0xfd027cebb953408<//gmapID><name>Robbie Farrell<//name>< Pictures>

I have been coming to James Harding at your dealership since I moved up here in 2006.He is wonderful.  I have always been given great service. Everything is always explained so I know exactly what is being done to my car. This service led me to buy my new Pilot at your dealership so I could continue my car maintenance with you. Thanks for continued great service!< /review>

There was a select few individuals who made the experience worth it. Dee our salesman and Wesley the finance guy were A+. Dee made sure to communicated through the process and rushed to complete everything in a timely manner because we had young kids and a Father Daughter dance to be at that night. Even after the sale Dee has gone above and beyond to help answer any question.

Al the manager on the other hand, sat there talking and shoot the **** with co workers. Every time we would ask how much longer, it was "15 Minutes" Well 15 minutes turned into about 45 minutes. He was rude and inconsiderate. When I asked what the delay was, he told me he just needed to finish preparing the file. Well, I was working with them all day over the phone so that I did not have to sit and wait. I do not appreciate being put on the back burner for side conversations with your friends.

Although I do feel that I received a fair price for my purchase, I do not feel they were fair on my trade in, and Al's lack of motivation made the experience dreadful.< /Review>

Chris was very helpful as our service representative. In and out quickly and courteous shuttle drivers to and from. Although the car was was broken and couldn’t be utilized this day it was not his fault and even offered to wash by hand. They even had a comfortable waiting area with refreshments and donuts. I would image if your serviced later in the day, this may not be the case. Very kind!! Highly recommend.<//Text>

I used to take my Honda Accord Sport to AutoNation Honda Fremont to get maintenance done when I was living in Hayward, CA. Honda AutoNation is my to-go place for my Honda vehicles! The staff has always provided me with excellent customer services, with care and satisfaction throughout the years.

On Tuesday, July 21, 2020, I had an enjoyable experience financing my vehicle from AutoNation Honda Roseville, and the price I paid for was fair! Sales Associate (Stefan Batres), and Finance Manager (Michael) are fantastic people! I thought they are knowledgeable and provided great assistance.

My aftercare was excellent too! The Salesman Manager and Stefan Batres) followed-up afterward. I have met with a couple of the Service Advisors (Rich Amader and Sam Malganji). They are very knowledgeable and provided fast and exceptional assistance, including the other staff from the Service Center department.< /review>

<review>The service department is always courteous and fast. Chris wasn’t available when I called, but called me back right away to let me know my car was ready and in great shape.  He made a point to introduce himself when I picked my car up later that day (I dropped it off the night before in the night drop). This is my second Honda through AutoNation and I am about to make my third Honda purchase with them.  Great folks and a great dealership!<//review>< date>

Hi My name is Stacy and I am a returning Customer to the Roseville AutoNation (Honda) This is my second Purchase from this location. Both times I was lucky enough to have the sales person Bianca. She explained to me in great detail everything I needed to know about my 2020 Honda Accord Sport.
All the staff there provided me with an excellent experience. Bianca slammed the deal with the knowledge that she had of the car that I purchased, Brian the manager took the time to explain to us in great detail the deal that we were going to get and Fadi finished it up with his finance magic!
A great big THANK YOU to Bianca and all the staff at AutoNation!

I LOVE My new 2020 Honda Accord Sport!
Thanks

<review>I purchased my Cadillac Escalade from the Freemont Honda Auto Nation. The salesman advised  there is a 90 day warranty on the vehicle and that I can take it to any AutoNation dealer if anything is wrong with the car, and lets not forget this is suppose to a Honda Ceritified Used car. Well not even a week the check engine light comes on. I take it to Auto Nation Chrysler Dodge Jeep Ram  they turn me away stating that because I did not purchase my vehicle with them the warranty would not cover there. So I contacted the manager at Freemont Honda and he advised me to contact Auto nation Honda Roseville. Initially I took it in and met with Saman . I left my car there and he called me back telling me to take it to the Cadillac Dealer directly to get it fixed as Honda could not fix it. Well I contacted the warranty company and they advised that I need to get it referred from an Auto Nation dealer directly or it will not be covered under warranty. At  this time I'm a bit frustrated all I want to do is get my new car that I just purchased not even a week to be fixed. I called and spoke to Saman and he advised me to come pick up the vehicle.  Frustrated I ask to talk to his manager. I spoke with Nick and explained what the warranty company told me and he called Cadillac right away and sent my car over to get fixed. Nick was absolutely helpful and also kept me updated with the status of my car. Unfortunately it took two and a half weeks to fix due to a back order part. When I called to check status with Saman he was very rude and said "as I told you there is a back order and as I told you it could take up to 3 weeks" probably upset that I spoke to his manager after he tried to brush me off because he didnt want to deal with fixing my vehicle because I did not purchase it there . After that conversation I no longer wanted to deal with him so I called Nick his manager directly.  He was able to get a ETA of when the part would arrive and when my car should be completed. I wish there was more helpful people like Nick that would find a resolution even though he did not make any money off of my purchase. Saman the service rep. was no help until I spoke to his manager. He also needs to brush up on his customer service skills to work at an auto care dealer. Thank you so much Nick the manager for your assistance.</review>< Pictures>

11/10 experience from pulling onto the lot to leaving with my new car! Mason provided unparalleled customer service. He listened to my needs & matched me with a car that fit them. Not once did I ever feel like I was dealing with pushy car salesmen. The whole experience was easy & in the end I left with a 2020 Civic happy as can be. Thanks Mason, Sammy, Jeff, & any one else who played a part in helping me!</Text>

I was greeted promptly, and told what the process would be and how long it would take to get started, service my vehicle, and explain the service when it was finished. And that's exactly what I received. Excellent communication and all my expectations were met in the timeline I was quoted.

Randy was thorough and polite. He answered all my questions with courtesy and clarity. It's one of the reasons I continue to allow Honda to service my vehicle.<//review>

<text>If you want the best car, I highly recommend Auto Nation Honda.  The used car Manager, Alicia referred me to a sales man named, Keith Denault.  Ask for him. I have purchased 3 Honda Accord Sports, the service he provided me from the cost to purchase, the customer care and everything else imaginable was done in integrity and with the highest level of customer service imaginable.  He is also kind, polite and very very very accommodating! The dealership as a whole is exceptional from Gary, Benny, Alicia, Keith and Nick, our amazing manager in the service department.

Randy my advisor really took care of me. I came in for a simple maintenance and oil change and When I had other inquires about my car he went above and beyond to make sure that I got full use of my Honda care. I was able to get my maintenance done as well as other work that I had questions about. He really hooked it up. I appreciate all his work and efforts.<//Review>

Would like to give a BIG shout out to AutoNation Honda Roseville for selling me a beautiful Honda Civic of my dreams. A BIGGER shout out to "Garry Neighbors" for helping me throughout the entire process Garry was very knowledgeable of the vehicle I selected and wasn't that "Pushy Salesman" that puts pressure on you to purchase a vehicle. Instead he was very kind and made me feel welcomed. I recommend anyone looking for a Honda to please go to AutoNation Honda Roseville and ask for Garry Neighbors he is the best and will treat you right. Also would like to add the financial advisor/manager that assisted with processing my loan was nice as well (I do apologize I forgot his name when I remember I will update my post) again no pressure on making me feel like I had to purchase extra services. Thank you AutoNation Honda Roseville for welcoming me into the Honda Family.< /Review>

Sales department was very nice and helpful but service, although the service writer was nice, was not good. We brought our vehicle in 2 times for the same problems and they did not fix them.  We won't buy from them again because service is at least as important or even more so than sales because that's the department where contact continues on.<//text>

I have never been so pushed to buy a warranty for my car. It was my first time buying a car and luckily I was with my brother who is experienced.  The finance guy's name was Wesley Stewart. At first, he asked me if I wanted to buy the warranty for my car and my brother politely said no. And then he asked several more times, I was really close to walking out and I could care less for the car. We were treated like dollars bills instead of customers. He forgot the fact that we are also human beings at the end of the day. After the deal was FINALLY done I noticed he did not shake our hands and had horrible customer service satisfaction. When someone says no the first time, you should respect their decision and get on with the deal rather than trying to keep asking us if we want to buy the warranty. Bennie the car sales guy act least treated us like customers and kept it real with us. Overall I will not be coming back to Roseville Honda and I will not recommend this place to my friends. Worst sales experience of my life.</text>

Everything was quick and easy. They have a nice waiting room and the woman that helped me was very kind. The issue was that I accepted the complimentary carwash but did not receive one.</review>

My 1994 Honda Accord had an "altercation" with a barbed wire fence, tearing my front fender partially off.  Thankfully, Rich and the Roseville Honda team were able to reattach the bumper with a few new clips rather than a costly new bumper.  They buffed out the discolorations also!  Thank you so much!!!</text>

I didn't leave until 530 with a rental. Didnt even leave with the car i had purchased. I was told my vehicle would be filled up for the inconvenience. When I picked it up it was on empty and the brakes squeaked and the belt smelt like burnt rubber. I am beyond disgusted with how things were handled. I have 2 kids.

I had an excellent experience buying my new car at Autonation Honda, with Ray Turner as my Salesperson. Ray was a great guy to deal with - he was very diligent, took care of all my needs and I never felt any pressure; he was a very cool guy all the way through the process. I appreciate how he trained me on the use of my new vehicle and got it all set up for my personal preferences. I felt I had custom personal care. I Appreciate all Ray did for me and the Company as a whole - everyone who helped me was pleasant and very professional. It is obviously a Strong Company with very high standards. I recommend them highly to anyone buying a car. And I have always had long-lasting use from my Honda vehicles, they are extremely dependable cars. I am One very Satisfied Customer! Thank You.</review>

Nick, who is the service director is a very professional accommodating understanding gentlemen. I had a bad experience and Nick made it more than right, this branch is top notch. I recommend this branch, they fixed the issue car is doing great! If it wasn’t for employees like Nick I would never consider buying a Honda again. Top notch! He actually listens to the customer and performs his job above and beyond. 5/5 stars, if I could rate higher I would.< /review>

<Text>Had a wonderful experience in the purchase of our new Honda Cr-V last year. This year we bought a used car of a different make than the dealer normally sells.It was a slightly different experience. I know it's easier when you purchase the same product. I did eventually get the call back I was waiting for regarding the extended warranty issue. I do like the fact you get a complete print out of what was gone through and fixed on the used vehicles along with the CarFax and a couple months warranty. That adds piece of mind.</Text>< Pictures>

Received good sales service, however the finance department is shady.  Even though I came in with financing they tried the games of trying to finance through Honda.  In the end they messed up my financing and had to drop services in order to make the loan work with my bank.  I would buy a car from a different dealership.<//text>

Went here looking for a used vehicle and drove off with a brand new Accord. My experience here was above expectations. Many thanks to Ray for not just going through the motions kind of sale. He was professional and pleasant without all the "let's make a deal" nonsense. He heard all my comments and concerns and was considerate about them. I recommend anyone interested in purchasing a vehicle to head over to AutoNation Honda Roseville!<//review>

I was fortunate enough to have Oscar help me out. I came in as a first time car buyer, and he walked me through all my best options.  Not once did I feel that he was pushy with sales. He was also very transparent which I value. I had some interest in a used vehicle, but I ended up leaving same day with a 2019 Honda Civic!</text>

<text>Waited almost three hours for a simple oil change and tire rotation after having an appointment. The waiting area is small with very little power outlets and no real space to bring work. They have a TV but was just a blue screen. Was told by an employee that it's pretty standard to have a 2 to 3 hour wait with an appointment.< /text>< pics>

They recommend replacing front brakes with 27.4+ mm on the rotors with minimum thickness of 26.00 mm.  This could have waited until next time.  Now makes me question other recommended services as to whether they are truly needed.  You need to have creditability in order to earn peoples trust.</review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

I made an appointment for an oil change on the wife's 2013 Accord. I work nights so was hoping for a really quick in & out.  I guess I'm just kind of old fashioned when it comes to an appointment, so I have to ask: would it have been longer than 2 hours without an appointment? Thanks Roseville Honda for respecting my time.
At any rate the staff is friendly and the waiting room is comfortable.< /Text>

Rosville Honda (Auto Nation) was excellent! On the website it showed the car I was poking for and I called ahead to make sure it was still available. Ray was the salesman I spoke with and he verified the car was there. He got the car for us and was very helpful to us. It was great customer service provide by Ray and everyone one else we dealt with. I would recommend going to them for a new car.</text>

< Review>
I arrived at a very busy time.  The wait in the line was very long.  The
young man who was finally able to help me was wonderful and took
the edge off of the situation quickly.  I then met the service manager
who was assigned to me, her name is Marie Quesada.  She further
assured me of exactly what would be done and how long this might
take.  I was very glad that I brought a very good book that I am reading.
Marie let me know when might be a better time to come the next time
my car needs service.  I left happy that I had such a good experience with
those two employees.  I might add that there were many employees
who most likely had other jobs that were not helping to ease the
back up.  If they had of, it might have been a much smoother and
less tense time for those of us who had to wait in our cars in the
heat for some time.  I just think that team work and wanting to
help, would have eased a rather tense and very hot wait.< /Review>

< Review>
In Roseville at the dealership and repair center,  I was helped by Randy who was just as nice as could ever be.   He got my car updated with oil change and rotation and let me know what was coming up with wear on breaks and tires (he never pressured me at all).  I had to wait a very long time because it was so packed when I came, but I enjoyed great coffee latte and three donuts over the course of three.hours.  I didn't mind because I knew that I was in good hands!< /Review>

Service was fantastic. I drove in instead of making an appointment and they were still able to take me easily for an oil change and multi-point inspection. They finished sooner than the time they predicted and were able to give me an easy-to-understand rundown of what was up with my car.<//Text>

WORST EXPERIENCE!!

I had an appointment to have 2 keys programmed. 2 1/2 hr wait. $151.
That was fine.

I take my car to the store and discovered that BOTH keys do NOT work. I try calling to inform them of their error. I had to call 3 times because no one would answer.

Once someone answered they asked me to bring it back. I bring it back and they grab me keys and leave. I am not informed how long it will take. I’m in the waiting room. Every customer is angry. It’s so unorganized.

So I wait an additional hr and a half. I go ask someone how long, I just want to go home. I finally get my keys back. They work. But no one told me why I had to come back to fix THEIR mistake. I was not thanked for bringing it back or compensated for my additional time or thanked for bringing it back. The whole experience makes me never want to bring my car back or deal with the people who helped me.< /Text>

<Text>So disappointing. I have been a customer of AutoNation Honda for years. In the past I have been extremely satisfied with their service , recommending them to friends and family. I arrived for my appointment slightly early and the line for check in was extremely crowded. Even though I had an appointment, it felt like I might as well shouldn’t have. It was obvious there was a problem with their appointment system. I was there for routine service and a recall. I was informed there was no way for the recall to be done, bummer. I left my car there for two hours, which was the estimated time for the other service. When I returned I checked where my car was in line. I was in a line of about 30 cars, none of them having been even touched in that time I asked for my keys and car back. I do not feel this is an error of the daily workers at the site, but rather management trying to save money by using a faulty scheduling system. The rep gave me a free oil change and tire rotation, but I know I will never use it because I will never return.<//Text>< Name>

<review>Overall, I had a good test drive, shopping experience, and overall am very happy with my purchase.  I spotted a 2018 HR-V listed at a good price through CarGurus, then on the AutoNation website directly, and was able to schedule a test drive and even reserve the vehicle, with no cost or obligation, immediately.  Got a great deal, was treated very well by everyone there, and am very pleased with my purchase.  Just note, this is a no-haggle dealership, so do your homework on value before going in, and knowing what you want helps.  ;)

<Review>My experience was very good -   the customer service  agent Bryan Boughton very extremely helpful and knowledgeable.

<Review>Never Again....Upon buying a car from them,  Inwas told that an extended warranty will be included.  Tree hat was a lie.  I overlooked it and decided to buy the car anyway.  Brought it home and the same day, the AC was not working as well as a headlight was out too.  Broug hmm t it in the next day and was promised an update on it.  That was annie as well.  Finally when they fixed the problems 2 days later,  I picked up the car and noticed a huge new ding on the passenger door.  Brought it back again and was told to come back another day to leave it for yet another repair.  Luckily I only hadnit for 4 days at this point and decided to turn it back in.  Staff is rude, careless and deceptive.  Will never shop here again.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics><response>{'time': 1591914837967, 'text': "Hi, we are deeply disappointed by your experience at AutoNation Honda Roseville.

I appreciate the fact my 9 AM appointment WAS at 9 AM , and I didn't have to wait longer. My options for a 60K care were presented to me  and explained well. Didn't have to wait long for the Courtesy Shuttle either :)
When the car was completed , my service advisor went over what all was done and rated conditions of brakes,, tires, suspension, etc. It's a good feeling to understand your car's condition is in good standing.</text>

The service took longer than expected 4 days, wasn't kept in the loop as much as I would have liked, the 1 part in car was taken apart and not fixed and didn't say anything my 4 day event wasn't fixed either, drove home and problem was still there, replacing with a new part shouldn't have the same problem, so I wonder if they did. No two happy.<//text>

<Review>First time taking my car to Roseville Honda.  Everyone that I talked with was very helpful and extremely professional.  I waited while my car was serviced and the wait room was comfortable and offered complimentary refreshments.  The service adviser kept me informed as to the progress of my car, and it was done when promised!  The job was done well and I am very happy with the over all experience.</Review><Gmap_id>0x809b1f8cb7689c85:0xfd027cebb953408</Gmap_id><UserId.>116192876383177532824< /UserId.></record>

Raj treated me like I had an appointment anyways and they were really busy that day. I was in and out very quickly and they washed my car too!!! 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼 Great Job Raj.</Review>

The dealer made it seem like he was there to help me then came back telling me due to my credit “this is the best I can do for you” even though before they ran my credit i showed him my credit report and told him if I wasn’t going to get a deal than I’d rather not run my credit at all. He made it seem like he’d pull a few strings...didn’t happen at all. All dealers are sharks and he was just another.< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

I have to say I felt like I was inconveniencing the Service Department when I brought my Odyssey in for a recall repair. I felt that way when I showed up at my appointment time. I felt that way when I showed up to pick my vehicle up. The work was done in a timely manner and, I will assume, was done correctly. I did appreciate they included their 27-point inspection. I was surprised that they noted a problem and never talked to me about it; I just found it when I reviewed the paperwork. I don't see any reason to visit this dealership again.<//Text>

Excellent! Greeted upon arrival by Mr. Amader. (he knows my car as he's helped me many times over the years.) Only needed an oil change and tire rotation so waited while to work was being done.
Waiting area was clean and comfortable. Service was completed very promptly.
Thank you Auto Nation Honda and Rich Amader.</text>

Honda Roseville was very pleasant to work with and had the exact car I wanted.  The out the door price was just what I had in mind - no surprises.  Starting with the Service Manager, Jonny Oconnell;  Sales Consultant, Kristy Lafleur; and finally Finacial Manager, Jeff Kisslar; all treated me with courtesy and respect.  Kudos and thanks!<//Review>

Went in just for an oil change. They did a good job. They even made a inspection of the CRV, top up the fluids and gave me a courtesy car wash after the a simple job of an oil change. Free breakfast , coffee and donuts were offered when I brought the car in for service in the morning. Their services are excellent.< /Text>

Everyone who works at Auto Nation is really very nice...but for the first time we’re considering switching to a Toyota because of service issues.

<review>I never write reviews, but Coleman of AutoNation Honda deserves to be recognized for his impeccable customer service.  The car buying process has its hiccups, but Coleman made the process go as smoothly and seamless as possible within his control.  I left an important document at home, of which stalled the transaction.  Coleman offered to take me home to retrieve the document.  Thanks to Coleman and his interpersonal and customer service skills, AutoNation gained another satisfied customer!  Thanks!</review>< user_name>

<Review>Took my car in for an enigine noise.  After the initial repair,  the check engine light came on.  After two more trips to the shop, the service department is now recommending a thousand dollar repair.  I don't have confidence in the skill of the service technicians that worked on my car and believe it lead to unnecessary repairs.  The customer service at this dealership was poor also.  I am taking my business elsewhere.< /Review>< pictures>

<text>They can’t even email or respond to talk. Started out ok but then stopped communicating completely. Then could not reach a competent person since a week ago. Multiple messages left with zero response. Seems like our business isn’t wanted because the car we want isn’t there yet and they won’t bother trying to locate one. Told two different things by 3 different people. Couldn’t answer very simple questions just about stock or allocation. And Honda you need to get some civic Si’s on the lot, there’s zero out of like 4 dealers in my area.<//text>< Pictures>

<GmapID>0x809b1f8cb7689c85:0xfd027cebb953408< /GmapID><Text>Buying a new vehicle from AutoNation Honda in Roseville through the Costco Auto Program was truly an enjoyable experience.  The no haggle price of our new 2019 CR-V was much better than other dealerships had quoted.  AutoNation Internet Sales Consultant Garry Neighbors was the best, answering all our questions and pointing out details that we had not thought about.  The sale was made in a timely manner, not the normal waiting around for this or that.  We financed through Honda and AutoNation Finance Consultant Mike Lazzara was efficient, personable and made the whole signing of countless documents a breeze.
Being a Senior citizen, I’ve dealt with many car dealers over the years, but have never driven off the lot feeling as good about the whole experience as I did from buying from AutoNation Honda in Roseville.  For me, based on my location, I probably wouldn’t have even considered them if not for the Costco Auto Program.  Bottom line, if your shopping for a vehicle I would recommend putting AutoNation in Roseville on your list, and ask for Garry Neighbors, you won’t be disappointed.< /Text>< Pictures>

<Review>Gabe assisted me with my first Honda purchase. This is my third new purchase through a dealership and I have to say, it was the most pleasant. I experienced no high pressure sales tactics from Gabe in sales or Mike in the finance department. After discussing with him what type and what I wanted from a vehicle he was able to narrow it down to a few trims. He was very knowledgeable about the competitors’ similar models and seemed to know that Honda would ultimately be the best choice based on what I told him. After going to view two other competitors’ vehicles, I returned and purchased a Honda with upfront pricing at a good deal. It was pleasant to know approximately what the total cost of the vehicle would be well before financing with no unpleasant gimmicks, i.e. drawing squares on paper to see how much money I would part with. The vehicle was quickly prepped and ready by the time I finished the paperwork. After I brought it home, Gabe checked in with me to ensure we were learning how to use all the features and if we were happy with the purchase. I will definitely look to this dealership again when in the market.</Review><Date>1555769477872<//Date>< Rate>

Great experience while car shopping with a budget and short time frame. Had the opportunity to work with Emmanuel Palomo, he was a very helpful salesman from start to finish.He answered all my questions and at the end of the day I felt very good with my purchase. I highly recommend anyone looking for a good car and service to go to Autonation(Honda) in Roseville CA.< /Text>

I just had an oil change, but was helped as soon as I pulled up,. It took maybe an hour from start to finish, but they noticed a cvc boot leak that I will have done in the next few weeks as it is a two to three hour repair( thank you extended warranty). Overall it was a great experience.<//Review>

<review>I brought my car in due to the transmission slipping here and there and a rough idle. It just started doing it but I wanted to take it in before it got any worse. I explained what was going on with Bryan Boughton my service guy. From the start he was very knowledgeable and very upfront. I have taken my car here for everything it has needed from the moment I purchased it from them in 2017. Bryan by far has been the most honest and upfront than almost all. The first day the tech found nothing out of norm and that worried me because for me my car is like my second home from 62 miles every day too and from work to being a soccer mom and a grandma, I know first hand if my car is off. Bryan asked if I would like to leave it another day and get a second set of eyes and a new tech to do a cold start in the morning and thank goodness we did. My vaccum hose was slightly off and the bracket was not straight. Bryan made everything easy to understand and really took what I said seriously. My car is shifting as should be so far. We decided I am going to drive for a couple weeks then follow up with Bryan if anything changes.
Great service...and I will be asking for Bryan from now on. Honesty goes along way!!<//review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

From the moment we were greeted by Garry Neighbors, the sales representative, until we drove away with our new Honda CR-V, we received an overall pleasant and professional car buying experience. Garry was knowledgeable, friendly and we especially appreciated his "no pressure" attitude. He listened to our wants and needs for a new vehicle and showed us the options available. We bought exactly what we were looking for. Thank You!</Review>

<Review>Our experience  was so easy.  It had been about 9 years since we dealt with a dealership and was dreading the experience again.  But fortunately this experience was great!  No pushy salesmanship, very friendly staff, let us test drive and then leave to think about it.  We came back 2 days later and bought the car.  Thanks for making car buying so easy.<//Review><userid>106800813818965435739<//userid><Gmap_id>0x809b1f8cb7689c85:0xfd027cebb953408<//Gmap_id><rating>5</rating><Time>1549065316984< /Time>< pics>

<review>After an unsuccessful trip to the Folsom Automall, we found our car at the Roseville Automall, because they had a much larger selection and excellent customer service. Our salesman, Benny Echols, was very helpful and courteous.  He provided us with all the information we asked for and did everything in his power to make sure we were happy with the purchase.</review>< GmapID>

We bought our CRV through Costco and had an excellent experience with Ray Turner with Honda Roseville. He was friendly and very helpful as we explored different CRV models. Ray helped us feel relaxed and excited about our new purchase.  We love the car and all the features!< /Text>

<text>6 months ago I wrote the below review. It’s been nothing but trouble since I purchased the car. I took it in for an oil change, and had a difficult time getting an employee to help me. They really had a “not my job” type of attitude when I asked for additional explanation for the papers I was given. I have also had the worst time navigating the phone tree. Any time I call (doesn’t matter the time of day), it takes me multiple times to get through to a live person. And I have left multiple voicemails trying to get someone to call me back. It’s encouraging that I’m not the only one that has felt like they treat you so well until you buy the car, and then the second you do, there is no good customer service to be seen. I have downgraded the stars from a 3 to a 1.

The great thing about Auto Nation is their no haggle on their used vehicles. The sales team were all super friendly and I didn't feel that typical "used car salesman" feel from any of them. The only complaint I have when I purchased my vehicle was they left the gas tank on practically empty and on my way home the gas light came on. So be sure to request they fill it up enough to get you home!</text>< Pics>

This is by far the best experience I’ve ever had buying a car. Very professional and respectful to customers. It was also the easiest process. Our sales person, Gabe was outstanding as well as Dominick in finance. They work with your price request and needs. I will be coming here for many years to come to purchase or lease our vehicles.< /text>

Easy of Buying - 5/5
Friendliness of Staff - 5/5
Time Spent - 4.5 hours

We had Gabe as our sales advisor and he was fantastic, stayed with us and had good conversation thoughout waiting for finance to be ready for us. Once it was we saw Mike L. as our Finance Manager, who helped us get pretty good financing and overall had a great sense of humor which is necessary since buying a car is stressful you need humor to break the stress and he did fantastic!

Overall a fantastic experience and would highly recommend.</Review>

I came to Roseville auto nation not knowing much about Hondas and Mark was the very first one to approach my brother, mother, and I. He asked what inwas looking for in a car and every small detail. Mark then finally pinpointed a perfect car for me. He didnt try to sell me just anything, he looked for what I wanted and he found it! He had to go out of his way to bring it to Roseville and I am so happy that Mark was my salesman. I totally recommend him for those who are still not exactly sure of what they want. Mark is awesome!< /Review>

<Text>I have tried other dealers and non- dealers in the area and always come back to Roseville Honda. They are competent and honest. One time we took the car in for oil change and service their response was none was needed except oil change.  Maybe a little more cost, but I know the car will be in good shape.</Text>< pics>

<Text>It's not that you would blame any individual for the horror that buying a car has become but the system in place at these new car dealers is insane.
My wife and I arrived just after 11:00 AM, we had our check book, our trade-in car's pink slip and we knew the car we wanted. (Honda Fit) We told the salesman, "we know what we want, we have the money, we do not want anymore extras, loans or "warranties."  They subsequently captured our car key, stalled us with an endless "just a few more minutes" as well as "make sure that you give us a high rating, anything less than a 10 is considered a fail."
Bottom line, it took SIX HOURS!  It's just not right.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>{'time': 1561068828429, 'text': 'Hi Jeff, thank you for bringing this matter to our attention.

From start to finish AutoNation Roseville takes great care of their customers.  We have purchased two cars from them and I don't think I'll go anywhere else.  The salespeople are always informative and courteous, never pushy.  The finance department was respectful of our budget and went the extra mile to make sure we were comfortable with the finance options.  The service department(Mike) always takes great care of our cars and it's super easy to make an appointment.  My car is always ready to go before I'm ready to pick it up!<//text>

<Review>Online service appointment scheduling allows same day appointments, however their system only updates overnight so your appointment may not actually be available when you arrive. I was helped  with courtesy and professionalism and ended up getting my car serviced as I expected, but there’s a potential for this to not be the case. Overall I have been satisfied with the services received here.< /Review>< resp>

After trying to purchase a vehicle at another dealership and not getting the service I needed, I contacted Autonation through their website.  Within minutes, I received a phone call from Anna.  She was wonderful and asked all the questions to find the vehicle my wife wanted.  The following evening, we made the deal and my wife and I drove down to pick up our new car!  The price was great, service was great and the process was easy.  There was no super long pitch on trying to get extra coverage or any of the other high pressure pitches that occur during the signing process.  It went very smoothly.  I would definitely recommend to everyone looking for a Honda to contact Anna at Autonation.</Text>

Thorough work. I went in for oil change and tire rotation.  The service representative showed me that I needed a 60,000 mile service and inspection. This service involved changing transmission fluid, rear differential fluid and an in depth inspection. I was concerned about the time it would take as I was waiting.

The service representative gave me an estimate of an hour and 45 minutes. I settled in to the comfortable waiting area and helped myself to some coffee. I had my phone to keep me entertained while waiting. The waiting room chairs were pretty comfortable and they had a nice TV on.

The representative came back to me in an hour and a half to tell me they were done. He had my paperwork processed quickly and I was done and on my way.  I was thoroughly satisfied with the time it took to complete the job and also very satisfied with the friendliness and professionalism of my representative. They also washed my car.

So I was very satisfied with the professionalism and timelines of the big job. He advised me that my brakes would need to be changed on my next visit. He did not pressure me to have it done and said I have enough brake pad left to wait a little longer. I was very appreciative of this. He did not pressure me into having work done that was not yet needed.  So in summary I was very satisfied with the work done and the efficiency of the mechanics. I was very satisfied by the service representative’s professionalism and concern that my job be done quickly. I highly recommend Autonation Honda for Service work.< /Text>

<Text>Avoid coming to this place! They are a fraud. I came to buy a 2018 Honda Civic and they told me that I was better off leasing. And that if I bought the car my payments would put me at 450/month vs 350 for leasing. Well I settled for the leasing for 36 month at 36,000 miles. If I go over 36,000 miles, I would have to pay for each mile. They told me that they could lower the cars price to 21,000 instead of 22,000 but when I read my contract a day later, I was paying the original price. I was also only given the basic care package in which covered the oil change. I will loose my care package in 2 months and it’s only been 16 months. If you want to be lied to and scammed, come here!<//Text>< date>

I love my new CRV-EX it has everything that I wanted. I did do my homework before I made a purchase. My boyfriend an d I bought it together and our salesman did a great job. The only thing is that we weren't happy about is that we were there  almost 8 hours. It was good to see how many people were buying Honda's.I did own an Accord in the past and loved it also I had another SUV that was not a Honda and I sold it recently. I was driving our Camry that we had and just didn't like it and really missed my SUV and my Accord. So I decided to have the best of both worlds. Thank you I love it.</Text>

I took our 2013 Honda Accord in for an oil change.  The service tech, Raj was as polite and helpful as always, I make a point to request him every time I schedule an appt.  The service checked my car thoroughly and offered to have it washed.  This is the first Honda we have bought from the Roseville Auto mall but won't be our last.  Thank you Raj.< /text>

Got first class service from AutoNation Honda Roseville yesterday. My engine oil light came on and I was close to the Auto Mall, so I called AutoNation Honda and talked to service advisor Randy Mitchell. I was on a tight schedule that day and needed to get in and out in an hour. Randy personally moved me up in the service line, and had my oil change and vehicle inspection done in less than an hour. When I got my car back the interior had been vacuumed, and I was on my way. Very pleased with the excellent service I received from Randy and the service department at AutoNation Honda Roseville. Five Stars!</text>

The worst car service ever I came in. Despite I am having appointment for the service, they did my service in 2 hours plus time. My advisor Bryan wasn't there and I have to wait half an hour for someone to assist me. Then they make me wait another 1.5 hours for the service. I missed important meeting at work because of these lazy and unprofessional people. I would not recommend them to anyone.
Worst service experience ever.
Maita Honda are much better in every aspect than this dealership.</text>

<Review>I had a great car buying experience here  at Auto Nation Roseville Honda. Jake was a awesome guide and he knew about the cars I wanted.  He gave me great options and alternatives. He was patient and honest. There was no peer pressure at all. Everything went fast and smoothly, way better than I expected especially with my credit score. All the associates that helped me were great and I'm glad I had went to Roseville Honda to buy my first brand new car.</Review>< Rating>

So I'm sharing this because even though it happen awhile ago I think it needs to be shared and understood you don't treat people this way.

I bought my car from this place a little over a year ago, I bought my car with no issues... But after a few months I needed an oil change and alignment done on my car so I went back up there to get it done. I had an appointment set and went with my fiance to get it done.

Once the car was done, the guy who had my keys (don't remember him name but a young guy) have them directly to my fiance... Not a huge problem (even though I did have my directlyhand out to receive MY keys) until he directly talked to my fiance about the car without acknowledging me at all.... He goes on to explain what was done to the car and I ask him a question about the alignment, when he finally decided to look at me, he again answered the question directly to my fiance without looking at me again.....

The car is in my name, the appointment was in my name, and even if he didn't know all of that (but he did because how did he know who to give the keys to without saying my last name?) still didn't take the time to ask who the keys belonged too. This isn't the only time this dealership has been sexist towards a female I know.< /review>

I bought my car at this dealership and the experience was great.  So naturally I want to continue my relationship with them for ongoing service. They make it very easy to schedule appointments online and when you get there, they are ready to get things going.  Ther service writers are very helpful and they get you in and out quickly.<//text>

<Review>Took our Pilot in for routine oil change/tire rotation. We had one issue that needed to be addressed but upon explanation, our service advisor wasn’t sure what it could be. However, we learned that the technician test drove it and was finally able to hear the noise and although he didn’t know what it was either he took the time and effort to research the problem and found a solution. It’s been almost one week and we haven’t had an issue. I appreciate that the issue wasn’t dismissed just because they didn’t know how to fix it. Thank you, Michael Burke (and your technician) for resolving the problem!< /Review>< Pictures>

<review>Had an appointment for 8:30am and arrived on time to a line of cars. Many cars that were in line behind me were helped before me. I had to go in and find someone to help me. And I'm still waiting for someone to help me. As I type this review I am watching 4 other cars/people being helped. I am not pleased with there customer service. I will be taking my business to another honda dealership or business. Hopefully once I'm helped the person is helpful!
Update: after 45 minutes of waiting and not being acknowledged I left. Very poor service! Will never go back!<//review><pictures>None</pictures>< user_id>

Went back to AutoNation and spoke with Eddie Xiloj about returning the vehicle as part of their 5 day 250 mile return policy where he informed me that the car must be returned in the same condition as it was purchased. Fair enough. He then proceeded to tell me that I blew the clutch BEFORE the car even went into service to see what was wrong and that the warranty would not cover the fix stating "you're young, it's a fast car, I'm sure you were driving it hard. It wouldn't be the first time."

After a bunch of back and forth with the service advisor, they found that the slave cylinder went out and I was not at fault for it breaking and they covered the fix under their warranty and I gave the car back next day. As I'm waiting for a receipt of the refund of my down payment, Eddie comes up to me and states "So Yelp, huh? Not happy with us?" and proceeded to defend everything he said rather than apologize for accusing me and my age for the reason the car broke. After I asked for his name, he refused stating "I dont want to be blasted all over social media." I would not recommend this dealership to anyone who is looking for any new or used vehicle and I would especially not recommend purchasing anything from Eddie Xiloj.<//review><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>{'time': 1583073350981, 'text': 'Peyton, we regret your experience with us here, but are glad you brought this to our attention.

Service scheduled for a Honda recall more than two weeks in advance.  I arrived for 7am appointment and was told parts are not available to perform service.  Why wasn't I contacted in advance with that information?  Very disappointed.  Service advisor was very nice but that doesn't excuse lack of notice.  I then was called twice by the remote call center asking why I didn't show for my appointment!!< /text>

<Text>I've always had pleasant experiences while taking my car in for repairs at AutoNation Honda.  The wait usually was no longer than 1 hour.  However, on November 3, I took my car in for a simple oil change.  I had an appointment for 7:15 AM.  Three and a half hours later and they finally got my car done.  It was a very long wait.  Raj was great and apologetic, but I think for those who had appointments, the wait shouldn't be there long for an oil change.< /Text>< Pictures>

<Text>I had a very very nice experience purchasing my FIRST Honda... HR-V Sport!!! I LOVE IT!!! I made arrangements with the internet manager to come in and test drive 2 cars; CRV and HRV. Well when I walked into the showroom I fell in love with what is now "my car"!!! It was the HRV Sports model all dolled up!!! After test driving 3 cars, I knew I wanted to the one in the showroom. Soooooo, the guys said let's make it happen! AND THEY DID!!! It was so easy, no pressure and that night after work I drove home in my Sport HRV!!! BEAUTIFUL!!! Thank you Honda for a great experience from beginning to end on my first Honda purchase!!!

Happy Honda Family!!!

There is no option to give half a star otherwise I would have given that. This dealer is only interested in selling vehicle. They don't explain the features and don't talk to the customer after the vehicle is purchased.
I visited their place asking to talk to the manager. The sales person took my number but no call from the manager.<//Text>

<text>I recently bought a car from AutoNation and was deeply disappointed with the experience. When I was signing my paper works, i saw that some of the papers were already signed off using my signature. I do not appreciate having something signed off without my approval. Another thing was that during the month of April, they were having an APR of .9 for 3 years or 1.9 for 5 years. The salesman tried to get me for an APR of 3.7.  The week before, he had done a deal for my Uncle and Sister and things went smoothly. He tried playing me for a fool and I don't appreciate that. Don't make excuses saying it was my credit. I had excellent credit. He also said he knew nothing about an APR of .9 then i graciously told him that Honda was having a special right now for it. When you're out here, please be careful and make sure to read everything. I also dealt with Mike Esp. from finance and he was amazing. Highly recommended when doing your finance on the car.<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

The service could be better if I don’t have to wait for two hours for just a regular change oil. The fact that I already set up an appointment ahead of time and came 15 minutes earlier. Still it took this long.</Text>

<Review>They couldn't honor a coupon from another Honda dealership in the area who had a better price for an oil change listed on their website. I had proof of the coupon but the service department at Roseville Honda said it was "to cheap" of a price to honor. So I called Maita Honda and they were more than willing to honor the coupon price. No hassle.  Looks like I will not be visiting Roseville Honda anymore.</Review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

<rate>1</rate><Review>I'm going to stop bringing my car in for service on a yearly basis here. This past time, I had an appointment to get my car an oil change and have the filters replaced. This service took over 3 hours to complete. I took my car to a Jiffy Lube about 3 years back for similar services and it took them 30 minutes.

I do not understand how or why it would take 3 hours for such routine maintenance. They did recommend I get new tires as the tread on them was starting to wear, so maybe that took them the extra 2 1/2 hours to do.

The other reason I am giving this 1 star is the pricing of everything. Oil change, air filter replacement, general inspection all cost $218. They also gave me a quote on tire replacement for $809!

They advised me it was a really good price since the service was on sale and it was the last day of the sale, but I told them I wanted to shop for a better price somewhere else. They re-iterated it was a really good price and since my car was already with them they could quickly do the service and have the car back to me within the hour. I explained to them that I would like to shop for a better price and if they had the best offer, i would set up an appointment later next week.

They advised that wasn't a good idea as this was the last day of the sale so it would actually be more expensive next week and that I really should get my tires replaced. I had to tell them I understand their concern and that I will call later to set up an appointment but that I really did need to go as it was coming on 4 hours of sitting around at the dealership.

I left the dealership, got home, and within 15 minutes found numerous tire centers with better prices that beat Honda's $800 offer (with discount applied!). I ultimately went with Costco as I got an offer on 4 new tires with installation services all for $354.

I highly advise you try and stop price gouging your loyal customers. You will lose them instantly, like you have just lost this one.</Review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

I have bought a car from here in 2008 and I had such a good experience that I came back to buy another car. Everyone is very friendly and knowledgeable. Dominic in finance goes above and beyond. He is very honest, knowledgeable, and helpful. Al the manager is very nice to. My salesman Paul went above and beyond by reaching out to me by email before I came in so I didn't have to wait around. He helped me find the car I wanted by looking via email and when I got there it was ready to go for a test drive. I came in a couple months ago as well and a salesman named Ray was very nice and friendly. I love how they don't pressure me to buy a certain car. I have had good experience here and would recommend them.</Text>

<text>I went to this dealership expecting a non hostile experience. The sales Rep by the name of TK was very rude and even got angry with us after we did not accept his offer.  He even went as far as to say" I dint tell you to come here to look for a jeep".  The hostility did not stop there he kept raising his voice and yelling at us for us to stay and talk. Overall very disappointed with the professionalism of this so called sales rep. I will be sure to tell others not to come here and do business with this place.</text><pics>None< /pics><Response>{'time': 1572895388184, 'text': "Hi Carmen, we can assure you that we do not find this type of behavior acceptable, and we would like to address the situation you have described.

I was greeted quickly by Raj's friendly face and was there on time for my appointment. Service (oil change) was excellent however it was a bit delayed. So I enjoyed a few cups of coffee and donut.< /review>

<Text>Great first experience leasing a car. Marco the sales manager and our sales person Peter could not have been more helpful. My wife and I took some time shopping all our local dealers online to find what best fit our price range and our needs for a new car. We contacted a few dealers via email and found one that met all our desires and needs. We contacted Marco the sales manager at autonation and he blew all the other dealers out of the water when it came to price for exactly the car we wanted. We decided to get a 2020 honda accord sport and autonation had the best customer service and the best price. Once we arrived at the dealership Marco introduced us to our sales person. Peter who was polite, helpful and answered all our questions. We did not feel rushed or pressured to do anything we didn't understand or anything we did not want to do. Peter and our finance manager Wes were very friendly and let's us take all the time in the world to read over all the documentation and answered any questions we had concerning our lease agreement. I couldn't have a asked for a better first experience. Thank you again to Marco, Peter, and Wes for being so helpful and getting us the great deal we wanted. We will definitely be back in the future to make another deal with the autonation team.</Text>< Pics>

Very pleasant car buying experience.  Lose one star for not filling the gas tank with car on empty :(.  Just lost another star for not sending me my toll transponder from my trade in vehicle like they said they would. And lost another star for bad post sales communications.<//Review>

Had gone to Carmax to get appraisal to see what Autonation would offer.  Surprisingly enough, trade amount was same as Carmax 😊.  Marcus was great, no pressure at all. Even though I had already researched the vehicle my wife wanted.  When it came time for finance guy, it was cool too, was made aware of all extended warranty options, with no pressure to purchase.  They were even able to lower my interest rate.  I know each case is different when buying a new car, but I could not be happier with how seamless everything went with Autonation Honda, would highly recommend.<//Review>< Rate>

I made an appointment to get my oil changed around 1 PM. I peaked outside to see what was going on around 2:30 and my car was yet to be touched. After asking around, I was finally introduced to the person who was assigned to be my service advisor. He advised me that this is normal for them because they're a high volume dealer. This was about the 3rd time I've had a poor experience here and I won't be returning. There are a couple good Honda dealers in the area. Avoid buying from or getting service from this place. Like the advisor mentioned, they do move a high volume of cars and it's not worth their time and effort to provide reasonable customer service.<//Review>

Took it for a test drive and decided we liked it. No haggle pricing was nice and not like the old days of buying cars. Oscar, Marco and Fadi were a pleasure to deal with. This was the most pleasurable buying experience I've had since I began buying cars.

< review>
The last 7-8 months the service department gas really gone down hill. The technicians failed to secure a part on after replacing the splash guard which caused damage to the undercarriage of the vehicle as well as cost me $208 to repair. The communication from the service advisors is less then acceptable in regards to returning phone calls, calling with status updates, and being able to reach them directly. We have been a loyal customer buying many vehicles from Roseville Honda over the last 13 years and sadly it is time for us to move on to another dealership. The last straw for me, was that the old service advisor changed our email address on file after the appointment so that we wouldn’t receive a survey. I brought copies of the service report from before and after the appt to show the service manager. As well as to address the many issues we had with the technicians and previous service advisor but my feedback, sadly, hasn’t provoked change for the better.< /review>

We also take our vehicles here for service, at least through their warranty periods. Expect normal dealer service pricing, but they take care of you and your vehicle and I've never had them recommended something that was not necessary.
In fact, I saw a service adviser send a customer away when she arrived for a n oil change service appointment she schedule with the maintenance minder reporting 40% oil like remaining. Something about her getting an email telling her it might be time to schedule.

Update 2/5/21. We are now going on 4 years dealing with this company. We leased a Civic in 2017. We then leased a CR-V in 2020. We have been treated with respect and understanding any time our vehicles need anything.

After another gentleman took my van and I was then told by the same Porter, still not the service manager, that my vehicle would not be ready until after 5 PM. So that meant that I had to stay at the dealership for 3 1/2 hours waiting for my recalled parts to be fixed. This was not part of my plan for the day. My husband told me to inquire about a shuttle and if I could be given a ride home. Upon such inquiry, I was told by the gentleman that was the service manager taking care of my van, that their shuttle would only take me up to 10 miles.My house is 15 miles away. I had voiced my displeasure and was obviously not happy. In the end I ended up paying out of pocket for a Lyft driver to take me home and that cost me an extra $25. While at home, I get a phone call at 3 PM saying that my vehicle was ready for pick up.
I am extremely irritated by the unprofessionalism of the service department at this location. I will never again take my car to AutoNation for anyway reason.<//Review>< resp>

The dealership is well-maintained and the staff are friendly and helpful.  Although we had an appointment with a salesman, he was not available when we arrived.  The young woman who helped us in his place, however, was very helpful and knowledgeable, so that was not a problem.

My main reason for the 3 stars rather than more was that my husband and I went there to buy a car.  I had a printout with the car's VIN number, easily identifying it.  It was a new car, not a used car.  We had no trade-in to discuss.  And we were buying the car with all cash, so there was no need to qualify for a loan or worry about financing.  We were accepting the price that the original salesman had emailed to us, and that, too, was on the printout I had with me.  Even so, buying this car took over 4 1/2 hours!!!  There was so much time that we just sat there, so much waiting when nothing happened.   It was very frustrating.  Our entire afternoon was consumed by a process that could not have been less complicated.  I have no idea why it took so very long.....but it was far too long for an uncomplicated, straightforward purchase.  Heaven help you if you are purchasing a used car and have a trade-in and need financing---you should probably just bring a sleeping bag and prepare for the long haul.</text>

<Review>I want to thank AutoNation Honda in Roseville for always taking such good care of my car. I came in for an inspection before my 33k mile warranty ran out and I am so thankful for my service advisor and the awesome tech, Jordan for finding an issue with my car! If they never found that, I would've been screwed with having to pay to fix it later. A huge thank you to the service advisor and the very friendly and helpful tech, Jordan! I will definitely be returning here.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

Johnny is always helpful when I go in for any service on my car. Not only that, but he is friendly and knowledgeable. Autonation Honda is honest and trustworthy, and they don’t try to sell you anything you don’t need. I highly recommend taking your car here for all service.< /Text>

Wow, where to even begin. After our horrible experience at the Roseville Ford dealership we were extremely nervous to go into Honda. We were initially greeted by the receptionist who called Mike Cunha over. Mike is honestly one of the most genuine kind hearted people I’ve ever had the opportunity to meet. He listened to our Ford horror story and made sure to hook us up with a fantastic salesman. Tim (Saleseman) was brought over to us by Mike. Tim approached us greeting us as if we were family. Tim spent time going over every little spec/ feature each car came equipped with. Narrowing down the search for our “Perfect,” family car. Not once did he try to pressure us into anything that didn’t fit our growing family. After our test drive we were ready to move on to the finance department where we were greeted by Wesley. Wesley immediately made a fantastic impression on us. He had the perfect personality for his job. He went over every little possible add-on, not pressuring us into any in particular. The perfect scenario for any couple starting a new family. Overall our experience was amazing and I can assure you we will be back within the next few months to upgrade my personal car as I wouldn’t want to work with anyone else. The team at Honda is one of a kind and you’d be silly to look elsewhere. Thanks again Mike, Tim, and Wesley you gentleman are amazing people and we look forward to working with you again soon.</text>

My experience with AutoNation Honda Roseville was different from any other I've had with a car dealership. I mean this in the most positive way possible.

On May 1st, my beloved 2017 Civic Hatchback Sport was ruled as a total loss after an accident. Being that I live in Elk Grove, I decided to check out the local Elk Grove Honda dealership on May 10th to find a replacement... That was a mistake to say the least. Don't go there if you have any expectation of customer service, no matter how low that may be. I'm not joking when I say that Elk Grove Honda had me test drive a car coated in dust with a giant bird dropping on the door.

After my foul experience with Elk Grove Honda, I gathered quotes from multiple dealerships near the Sacramento area. AutoNation Honda Roseville was super responsive from the get go, Gabe provided a quote through email and followed up with a phone call for more details to help me find the car I really wanted.

After determining that AutoNation Honda Roseville had the lowest quote of the bunch, I called to schedule an appointment. Coleman scheduled to meet with me that same day and we test drove a new 2019 Civic Hatchback Sport. Coleman was super friendly, and really knowledgeable about the car and the new Honda Sensing features that are in the some of the 2019 models. His genuine interest in Honda was apparent, he has one himself!

The whole process was quick. I came in at around 5 and left before sundown. Most importantly, I left in a freshly detailed 2019 Civic Hatchback Sport and my life was no longer disrupted from not having a vehicle.  All my thanks go to the folks at AutoNation Honda Roseville, you're all fantastic!

I absolutely recommend going to this dealership if you're in the market for a car.<//review>

<review>service was very good and Emily did a good job of getting my element in, fixed and out within a reasonable amount of time even though i had to leave it overnight and the job took less that an hour to diagnose even though we already knew the CEL code was for a knock sensor,,,
i thought $250 was a bit extreme for the same sensor i could get at auto-zone for $75 ...
i had already changed this sensor for $17 but was unable to get the code to clear.. was why i went to dealer in he first place... oh well, looks like the problem is solved.. hope it stays solved for the next 174,000 miles...< /review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

We just bought a 2018 CR V yesterday from Ed P. It was probably the best car-buying experience we've had in over 15 years. Ed was professional, genuine, and helped us work out a deal with our trade. He didn't try to sell us something we didn't want or need, and instead listened to what was important and what we could afford. I will definitely make sure our friends and family see Ed in the future. Great guy.

I loved our experience at AutoNation Honda. Even though they were PACKED,  they still managed to give us a wonderful, personable service.  Our salesman, Imran, was AMAZING. He was not pushy.  He was very informational,  relatable,  professional,  respectful; just an all around great salesman.  We drove a very long way.  He made sure we were well cared for,  even when I got a headache,  he had that covered as well! Then the man that did our financing was so funny and personable, he made our time there doing the paperwork a breeze! We could of talked to him ALL night! The two of them were just fantastic. I would definitely recommend AutoNation to everyone. And their cars are immaculate.  We bought a used Tahoe  and it looked brand new. The price was unbeatable!</text>

I got a great deal on a 2005 Toyota Tundra.  It is in excellent condition and only had 129000 miles.   Sales Associate Will and  Finance Manager Mike Gonzales were extremely helpful.  That was definitely not the negative truck buying experience I was expecting.   It turned out to be a nice day.< /Review>

Very kind and easy to talk to. It's always great to go somewhere and the employees are professional.

Mike Cunha was an amazing car sales rep that went above and beyond to make sure I was comfortable with my purchase. He was patient, answered all of my questions and even ended up washing my car to make sure I would get out of there on time. The whole experience at Auto Nation Honda was so pleasant that my sister ended up buying a car too. My family has purchased from here before and I will be sticking with them for my next purchase. Don’t hesitate to come here for your purchase!</Text>

My purchasing experience was fine. The salesperson was average at best, but the finance manager was very good. I paid a little extra for a Honda pre-owned "certified" truck. The salesperson touted "certified" saying it was worth the extra money because they do a 182 point inspection. This truck was for my wife, but I drove it one time within the first week and immediately notice the alignment was out. Maybe the alignment is not one of the 182 points they inspect?? Regardless, I called my salesperson one week after driving it off the lot and had to leave a v-mail letting him know my concerns. Two days later and no return phone call, so I called the finance manager who helped me and left my second v-mail.  It's now going on two weeks and no one has returned my v-mails. Should I be required to call three times to get a single return call?  Sorry, but I do not see myself buying from Roseville Honda or AutoNation again, nor can I recommend them to anyone else.< /text>

This review pertains to the Finance Department at Autonation Honda Roseville. We bought our car with cash on Monday, June 10. On Tuesday, June 11 we spoke with Matt in finance and told him we wanted to cancel our Maintenance and Extended Service plans. He said okay but it would take about a week for the funds to come back because the paperwork needed to be processed. We waited and heard nothing. We tried calling Matt and could not connect with him. We spoke with Gabe, our car salesman, who also tried to leave messages for Matt. Then Gabe asked Eddy to get involved. Eddy found out the cancellation paperwork had never been submitted. Eddy sent us over the paperwork on June 28. I filled out the paperwork and scanned it and sent it back on June 28. I did not hear a word. I left three voice messages with Eddy and one e-mail. I called Gabe again to let him know how unhappy we were with this whole process. Then we went to the General Manager, Les Braner, in person to complain. He passed us back to Finance with a rookie finance person, Kerry, who didn't know how to access our claim. Several more people came in and they found out that the paperwork was held up because they couldn't figure out what loan company we went through. We paid cash and if they had done their due diligence they would have seen it on the sales contract and the cancellation paperwork. So at that point they assured us we would have our money by the end of the week. That was three weeks ago and we still do not have our $3,545 back. This has been going on for over three months.

Just wanted to add to this review. We have received all of our money back.< /Review>

Extremely disappointed, I have taken my car to this dealership for years.
However lately their customer service is Not Good At All, you could probably take your car to a ziffy lube or a Walmart and the needed service would be done within a reasonable time frame and far more professionalism and integrity.
My door latches were not operating and I had to take my car in twice, (with appointments both times) because either they did not get to it within a 8 hour time frame or they "forgot" to order the necessary parts. If you attempt to talk to the service manager he is no where to be found...............strange...........no customer service.
But something I live by Roseville Honda
"Reputations are easy to make, but hard to break" meaning if enough customers start receiving the same kind of service, No one will go to Roseville Honda to have their car serviced and it will become the place where people will Not bring their cars for servicing, there are other places to go to for car servicing. Sleep on that Roseville Honda.< /Text>

Showed up for my 4:30 PM Saturday appointment for 1st service on my new Honda Clarity Electric.  Place was empty, and there were several employees standing around using their personal mobile devices. Took at least 15 minutes to get my car checked in, and at least 1 hr, 30 minutes to get my multi-point inspection complete and tires rotated.  Seemed too long for a place that was not busy.   The waiting room didn't have any free beverages or snacks available as advertised.  When I went to leave, the service representative was unable to answer questions about the maintenance schedule of my electric car (I bought it at this dealer).  Finally upon leaving, the "service reminder" was not turned off on my car.

The next day, for the first time in 16 months, the tire pressure light came on falsely on my car.  After checking tire pressure, it was at the specification in the door jam.

Overall, not a great experience.  The extra time pushed into the nap/meal/dinner schedule for my 2-year old, and it made my Saturday quite miserable.

I would probably not recommend taking your car to this Honda Dealer, unless you have absolutely nothing else to do except wait for employees to get around to helping you.

On the bright side, the service technicians were friendly.  And since it wasn't crowded, it was nice and quiet in the waiting room :)</Text>

I am a first time buyer and I was nervous going into this and making such a seruous decision, but it went great! My salesperson, Mohammad, was absolutely great and showed me different options and talked me through the process. I was looking to buy a car for my mom as a suprise for Mother's Day and the staff was very helpful to my needs and answered all my questions and worries! My boyfriend bought a car there and when he knew I was looking for a car for my mom he insisted I buy it here and I am so happy I did! Everyone was super friendly I got an awesome deal for an awesome car!<//review>

As you can see by their reply this is an auto-reply that they send to everyone that doesn't give them a good review.  The phone number is NOT for the manager and you will not be able to reach him.  It's just a general number.  Anyway, they took a look at my car and admitted they disconnected a harness causing the issue with my car.  A quick fix and now my car is working.  This should have been fixed the first time when I let them know the problem.  It's fixed now and I will increase my rating from one star to three.

Had a recall notice for my Honda Element.  They sent someone to come out and fix.  That part was great.  The technician worked on it and now my car doesn't work.  I called Roseville Honda minutes after the guy "fixed" the recall issue and they will not look at it.  They told me to contact the tech and have him fix.  He won't deal with it because he doesn't work for me, he works for Roseville Honda.  I don't know what to do now.  It sucks but now I have to take the bus because of AutoNation Honda Roseville.  Next step for me is BBB about this SCAM OF A PLACE run by grumpy old men.</text>< Pics>

We've owned two Honda Pilots since 2006, and have used our Dealer's service department for every maintenance need.  They are professional and organized, and accountable for what they provide. Especially people like James Harding.  He was forthcoming about needed repairs and gave honest estimates without the usual crooked-sales-pressure approach. In the days when people cannot afford to give their cars, AutoNation Honda realizes they can survive just as well by providing Honest, Reliable Service.<//review>

<text>The initial offer they gave me was much higher than another dealer. After negotiating for over an hour they were able to give me the best price. Not pushy with sales and financing was a breeze. They acquiesced to having accessories installed before I took ownership. Some hiccups but overall would buy there again. Raj at parts and Jason at sales were pretty cool to deal with.< /text><gmapID>0x809b1f8cb7689c85:0xfd027cebb953408<//gmapID></record>

I have been coming here for service since 2008.
My car would not start. I got my car towed to this place to get it fix at noon. I was told by Rich, that he would call me back within couple hrs. So between 230pm to 517pm I had called 6 times spoke to Isabell 4 times and even put my number to get a call back. Not a single call. Called back at 530pm. I finally got Rich and was told that my car has not been check yet. Well I had no transportation to work for tomorrow. Rich offer a rental but I have to be there by 6pm. Got to Enterprise but I was 5 mins too late. If they just called me and let me know what's going on I could have planned accordingly. I go to Honda because of the customer service they provided me in the the past. This is my last visit.
Just go somewhere else.< /text>

<time>1571501647608< /time><rate>5< /rate><Text>First of all, Honda Roseville need to hire better people next time to approach others even on busiest time of the week. I had came to this place about 3 or 4 times with my best friend Jenny. I’m also writing on her behalf to state that her salesman was Ed. He greeted Jenny and her family.
However, the car she wants was too overpriced due to the add on feature. She didn’t want any of these features on her car. The salesman couldn’t remove it due to Honda policy for their car. So she needed up getting her car at Honda Folsom? The second time I came with her, Ed was there again and he did talk to us. Moreover, I am shocked and disappointed that no one helps  us. Jenny and I just continue to shop around and look for a vehicle that I wanted and left without saying any words. No salesman wouldn’t talk to me or her. What a bad experience it was on that night? Third time I came in during my visit, I was greeted well this time by Mason. He was the only one who care enough for his customer and who understand what I was going through during this difficult time. We test drive the Honda Civic Hatchback Sport. This was the car that I wanted. Why? I had a car accident on the 11th of September. It wasn’t easy to dealt with the insurance and the other parties. I had to go through so much process to get back on my feet. Mason told me he understands. He told me to keep in touch until I get my warranty check from Future Nissan.
When the day finally comes, I was ready to go back to Honda Roseville. I was greeted again by Mason.
We did the paperwork. It was a long process. He managed to get me a deal and to work with Jeff at the financial department. Finally, I was able to get the car that I wanted. There is always an option from Honda Roseville. Mason and his staff had pull it through this time and I am thrill. I didn’t want to be in a rental car for another week or month. The cost of renting a car is too overpriced.
It was time to get back on my feet.
If there is a problem, I will called Mason or Jeff to escalate the problem. They were helpful enough for sure. I am loving my new car. I hope to come back in the future to get my teenager a car from this place. Mahalo (thank you) Mason, for helping me and my ohanas (family). Keep up the good work of greeting and approaching to your customer because that is the kind of customer service people are definitely looking for. As for the other salesman, I very disappointed from the lack of customer service.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

<Text>Purchasing experience was good, but was told they lost the second key fob to my new car.  I was told they would get back to me within a couple days but no later than 1 week.  Ten days later I finally received a call and was told they could not find the 2nd key fob, so I scheduled an appointment for 7 am four days later and was told it would take about half an hour.  I showed up for the appointment for the key fob, that I should have received with the purchase of a new car, and was told that only lube techs showed up this early, nobody would be in for 2 1/2 hrs. with the ability to program the 2nd key fob, and they didn't know why someone scheduled the appointment when nobody would be there to help me.</Text><name>Mike Nichols</name>< Resp>

The day after I bought the Equinox the engine light came on. I was not worried about AutoNation fixing it my only concern was time frame and car rental. I had to get Alicia Egen, and Nick envolved to get the car rental extended. I feel that more customer training is needed on newer service team members and if they can't get the answers they need to get help before frustration sets in. I  know it takes time to find the car problem but providing a car rental should never be a problem for the first 90 days of car purchase  or under extended warranty. Thank You  for all your help and I will still come here for my service.<//review>

Reserved my car on Autonation and picked it up a couple days later.  Paid the lowest price and saved thousands over other dealers.  The best part was no negotiating and going back and forth for hours wasting my time.  The whole process was simple and professional and by far the best car buying experience I've ever had.< /review>

The experience we had at AutoNation Honda Roseville was extremely pleasant. We where treated very well. The sales staff went out of their way to get us a great deal on our vehicle. We ended up purchasing two vehicles that day, and are really enjoying them. Would highly recommend purchasing a vehicle from this dealership.</text>

I sent a request for info on a car and Mike called within 15 minutes. He was pleasant and helpful. The car was exactly as described and we thought it was perfect for our daughter. A reset light came on the dash and called the service department and they got me in quickly,  there was no problem getting it reset and out the door.  James in the service department was thorough and friendly, as was the young man at the service desk. Our overall experience was pleasant I would recommend them without reservation.<//review>

<review>I had a Saturday morning appointment. My service advisor was Bunna and I felt that despite a long line of cars coming in for service, my appointment was processed and handled quickly and efficiently. The maintenance was a bit major so it was going to take several hours; we had Cooper driving us to the mall and his drop off and pickup was also fast and pleasant. I'd recommend this dealership's service department any day!<//review>< pictures>

Everyone is really nice. However I had an oil change appointment for 10:45 and they weren't done until 4:00. I live 2 hours away but luckily my daughter lives there in town because I couldn't imagine waiting at the dealership that long. It just seams like they were overbooked or something. I will go back though.< /Text>

I have considered buying a civic at Autonation,  because I had a very good day purchasing my Ram pick up at Autonation.  But what totally ruined my experience was the guy at the end trying to browbeat me to buy an expensive 3.000 dollar warranty. He would not take no thank you for an answer. Ruined my whole experience.</Review>

< review>
Got my vehicle here 1.5 years ago and I was so happy with my purchase until I came in today to talk to finance about the warranty. Once the sales person realized I was t there to buy a car, they left me in the lobby without even asking my name for over 45 minutes. When the original sales guy came by, he noticed I was still standing there and immediately found a finance guy magically. My question literally took five minutes. To top it off, the AC didn’t work, and it was 100 degrees today. So a sweaty 45 minutes for an easy question. I tried calling all day and no one answered the phones. I guess they’ll bend over backwards to sell the car, but forget about you if you’re not throwing money at them.

I love Honda, but go somewhere else to buy yours! It’s a drive but the Honda in Auburn is amazing so take the drive and save your self.<//review>

A week or so after the skid plate started scraping on bumps. Tried to contact the service director 6 times and was even transferred to game stop once. The skid plate was missing the two bolts in the front and was clearly not replaced properly. Never received a call back. Had to fix it myself. Save yourself the trouble and go somewhere else. 0 stars.< /Review>< pics>

Matt was great. No Playing games, just informing us of our options and finding the best fit for our needs. We were literally in and out of the dealership with a new CRV purchased in less than an hour. My mom loves her new car and I will be buying my new car with Matt and AutoNation Honda Roseville very soon.

Received awesome car service here recently. 5/5 stars! Employees were extremly friendly and happy to help with my oil change. They also found a nail in my tire and helped to patch that up without any fuss. The complimentary car wash offered is also a plus! Thank you for the great experience AutoNation Honda Roseville team. Keep up the excellent car service!<//Review>

<review>Just want to say thank you to Roseville Honda for a great price on the car and great customer services provided by the sell team, Steve, Garry, and your finance team throughout my purchasing process. Garry went out of his way to get me the best price for my new Pilot and follow through with it. Steve provided great customer service and wealth of knowledge. My observation of his customer first attitude was outstanding.  Keep up the great works, guys! Also if I know anyone want to purchase a new Honda, you guys are on top of my list for sure.< /review><Date>1486146486656< /Date>< Response>

<review>I have purchased 3 cars for my family in the past 2 1/2 years and needed one for myself.  My experience at AutoNation Honda in Roseville was amazing from chatting online and to the end.  I got the car I wanted, the color I wanted and the payments I wanted.  the entire process was quick also.  Not as much paperwork as with other dealerships.  Everyone was great and I even got my tire in my old care inflated because the light came on and they took care of me.</review><gmap_id>0x809b1f8cb7689c85:0xfd027cebb953408<//gmap_id><Name>Carmen Harp< /Name>< user>

I am really disappointed in the service. I felt like a bunch of hungry wolves were pining for their next meal the minute I stepped out of my car. Derrick was our salesperson. He was nice, not very informative. We knew more about the Odyssey he sold us than he did. We bought the car pretty late into the night, so we were invited back for a 30-minute technology review the following weekend. We went back for our headsets because Derrick FORGOT to give us our headsets. We drove all the way back and Derrick was busy with other customers. We felt unimportant and unvalued...again, like we were the next meal. We figured out most of the technology stuff from reading the manual. Thanks, but no thanks, Honda Roseville. Your customer service is lacking. And no thanks for any purchase gifts. At least at Toyota has the decency to give us freshly baked cookies.<//Text>

I like how TJ assisted me with understanding different functions of my new CRV. He went over details clearly and was available for questions. There was no pressure at all.</review>

<rating>1</rating><review>We purchased a vehicle here at the end of May with hopes that this dealership would live up to all the great reviews here.

Unfortunately, it has been a terrible experience once we purchased the vehicle. We have attempted several times to contact Eddy Xiloj on discussing our finance information for over two weeks without a response.

We have tried talking to other managers, sending an email, and calling dozens of times.

I'm hoping we can resolve our situation but just based on this behavior I cannot recommend this location.</review>< pictures>

<Text>Worst new car buying experience! Bought New 2018 Accord EX-L on the 18 Dec 2018. They had to replace right front passenger door panel because of scratches, dent on back right quarter panel, tint guy stretched Leather on the back seats and left water stains on speaker covers and leather headrests. So they replaced the back seats. Frame by the hood was bent, so on the 4 Jan 2019, I told them to just keep the car and cancel the deal because I haven’t had the car for over two weeks of buying it.
This place is about quantity sold and not quality. Don’t buy from this place unless you want to spend countless hours there to fix problems like these. I am a Veteran, so yes I pay attention to details and clearly this dealership doesn’t care about details at all.
On top of all this they gave me a rental car from enterprise and I return it on 04 Jan 2019 to Matt in finance, on 09 Jan 2019 I get a call from enterprise stating I need to complete a stolen car report because Matt handed the keys to someone and that enterprise can’t locate the vehicle, trying to put the blame on me even though I relinquished the keys to Matt in finance and he stated “no problem, I will take care of the rental car”.
I will not ever do any business with Honda ever again. Please save your time and go to another dealership! If I could put ZERO stars I would.<//Text><Name>Michael Coughlin<//Name><GmapID>0x809b1f8cb7689c85:0xfd027cebb953408</GmapID><Rate>1< /Rate>< user_id>

<review>I recently purchased a new CR-V Touring from AutoNation. This was my third purchase from AutoNation. I did a lot of on-line research looking up all the options and comparing the CR-V with other makes and models. Kelly Blue Book gave me an idea of what the purchase prices were in our area and what to expect for my trade-in. Then I checked out other Honda dealers in the area for suggested prices and inventory. The purchase process went very smooth and between my trade-in and the asking price for the CR-V I am pleased with the purchase.  The sales person spent time with me demonstrating all the new features. I'm a little old school yet when it comes to the electronics and he was patient and thorough. I recommend to anyone to do your homework and then visit AutoNation. You will not be sorry.<//review>< Pics>

<Text>Ed was awesome. He was friendly and attentive. I sent a request online and Ed responded right away. He listed to my needs and emailed information for two Honda Pilots. I chose one before I went to the dealership. When I arrived at the dealership, on Labor Day, Ed was ready and eager to work with me. He went over the specs of the Pilot. The dealership was full and busy. But, Ed didn’t rush the process. And, Will, the finance associate, was also friendly and thorough. It was the best car buying experience I’ve ever had!<//Text>< Pics>

<rate>2< /rate><text>I drove 200 miles to Roseville to buy my Honda HRV because they had the color I wanted and had emailed a price that was better than I could get locally. Suffice to say, they didn’t honor the price (“oops, there was a protection coat on the paint and rugged car mats we have to charge you for,”), negating the purpose of driving to Roseville. Then the financing experience was so long, and so awkward as the finance manager went on and on about growing up homeless, living in tents / just TMI and after a while the story didn’t add up. After finally getting the car, they helped me hook up my phone, but that was about it. THEN I get home and the copies of the paperwork are messed up so I can’t register the car, and took 3 days to finally get them to return a call. Will not waste my time in Roseville again.<//text><time>1559483903657<//time><username>Trudy Dulong</username><user>109301946500018143767</user><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

We ended up taking the car to a mechanic down the street who told us there was in fact no timing belt tensioner fluid leak.

After searching and going to countless dealerships, Roseville Honda was by far the best dealership I have ever been to. All of the staff and members were so nice and polite and truly cares about your expirence. They had exactly what I had in mind and made it come true. My sales representative Oscar was very professional and helped me find the best deal. Roseville Honda is the best!!</Review>

I’ve been using Auto Nation Honda for a few years. I’ve always been happy with the service. My service representative Raj is very friendly and always helpful letting me know what services I need and also telling me which services can wait. Plus my car always comes back clean. Ask for Raj if your Honda needs service.<//Review>

< review>
"Stop calling my job, if you're going to fill out the application and we get you a preapproved do it other than that don't do it" is exactly what Ray Turner told me. He works at Auto Nation. "Have someone else help you Kyra Im done" is the response I got when i asked "Why" he wants me to stop calling the dealership when I've only called TWICE! I was calling because I know sometimes dealerships have seasonal deals and I wanted to check on if they had any with no money down. I called the first time he never really got back to me so when I called back they said that he was my assigned salesmen and I told them I would like to come in on Saturday to look at some cars. I get a text message about three hours later from Ray stating what I posted above. Smh, worst customer service! I will not be coming here again.< /review>

< review>
Autonation Honda Roseville has the worst Finance department ever. I was promised a full refund of my Vehicle Protection Plan (VPP) if I cancel within 6 months when I purchased my vehicle . I went in to cancel after 4 months and I was told the check will arrive in 3 weeks. I called up after 3 weeks to check the status of my check - I was told it will take 6-8 weeks. OK. I called up after 8 weeks and to my surprise I found out that the refund was rejected by someone as they did not receive my payoff information. They did not even have the courtesy of calling me and letting me know they need some paper work. I was told it will be resolved soon. I mean WHEN? Again, to my surprise I am not being told that the check will be prorated after 60 days as I cancelled after 4 months - so I loose somewhere around $300 - although I was promised a full refund within 6 months of cancellation. I am yet to receive even my prorated check and god knows when I will receive it. - NEVER purchase a vehicle from Autonation Honda. If you want to purchase a Honda, go to some other dealers in Folsom or Sacramento but not to Roseville.</review>

<review>Worst experience we have ever had. We loved the car we came to see at their lot. We decided to buy it and signed all of the paperwork after waiting six hours in their facility. When we were finally about to drive away they told us they sold us the wrong car and that the car we had was actually more expensive than what we signed for.. they also said we were not allowed to use more than one form of payment and that we had to take out a loan. We wanted to pay most of it in cash and rest on my credit card so I could pay it off next month. Pushed us to get a loan so that they can make a little more money. Worst businessmen I have seen in my life, they do not value your time! Id never walk back in there!</review><gmap_id>0x809b1f8cb7689c85:0xfd027cebb953408</gmap_id><userid>116191666284075055342<//userid><resp>{'time': 1568647995644, 'text': 'Hello Mos, we are deeply disappointed by your experience at AutoNation Honda Roseville.

< review>
I purchased my BRAND NEW Honda Civic 2017 LX in March of 2017 and now it's not working at all.

This is the very first vehicle I've ever purchased. I've taken good care of it only to be completely ignored by this dealership.

I URGE you to save your time and money and go somewhere else. They don't and won't care about you after the sale, I guarantee it. I would never want what is happening to me to happen to anyone. Still paying for a brand new car sitting on my drive way.

SERIOUSLY - DO NOT COME TO THIS DEALERSHIP.

I called and spoke to several associates.. Rob and Bob who showed lack of empathy. I connected with Steve who at the time sounded shocked and very concerned to have this taken care of. I explained that not even the towing service is unable to tow my vehicle. Since then, no one has contacted me until I received a call from a man who basically said - sorry we won't be doing anything bc you'll have to pay for it to get towed and even then, they'll discuss what it will cost me.
I spoke with the actual company and their representative said she’d connect me with Elk Grove Honda.</review>

This was our first visit to AutoNation Honda after acquiring a 2013 Fit. We received a recall notice for an airbag and were pleasantly surprised when they had the replacement airbag in stock and were able to change it out right away. Raj was great to work with. At no extra charge, they did a full inspection and washed the car as well.</review>

This review has nothing to do with the Sales center for new vehicles but for the service department and the independant owner of this location. My 2012 Honda Civic recently popped the code for transmission oil drain and refill and as always, I called around my local Honda dealers to check pricing on this service. Now I understand locations being in different financial demographic areas and prices fluctuating based on that; but how in thee world is this location going to charge 250% more for the same exact service another Honda dealer charges?  I was quoted it was $225 for a transmission drain and refill, which is a typical Honda recommended servicing per the manual!! Called Elk Grove Honda... they wanted $120 and finally reached Folsom Honda where they only charge $89.99. How is this even possible? How can a price on a service fluctuate that much? Honda Transmission Oil is only $7 a quart. This is a crooked establishment and I would steer clear and make sure to call around! Very discouraging and I'll be sure to inform anybody I know who owns a Honda not to line this owner's golden pockets.< /Review>

Met up with Eric Luna who’s a sales advisor over at AutoNation Honda Roseville. Going in, I thought I would be sucked into getting a vehicle I didn’t like/want. Eric made my experience a very enjoyable one. Never pressured me into looking at other cars other than showing the ones I wanted to see. Answered every questions I had promptly and also very knowledgeable at the vehicles. I’m glad I stopped in to purchase my brand new Honda Civic here at AutoNation Honda Roseville and for Eric Luna to help me through every process. Thanks Eric.</text>

Professional, efficient, knowledgeable and friendly from the first moment to the last hand shake.  I looked at other vehicles at other dealerships but Michael Cunha’s awesome salesmanship brought me back to Auto Nation Honda.  I’m happy with my new CR-V and am confident I will continue to get amazing service when I need it from Michael.

<rating>5< /rating><Review>James Harding is the best. He is always honest and provides as much information upfront as he can and then keeps me informed as things move along. This last visit my air-heater blower wasn’t working and everyone thought it was fixed until I started my car to go home but the blower still wasn’t working. One of the managers set up another appointment. That evening I received a call from James apologized and assure me that he would get it taken care. Over the years I have worked with James my trust in him has grown. I know that this Friday the problem will be fixed. Thank you James for being there to help me.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>{'time': 1561523385164, 'text': "Hi Donna, we're very happy to have provided you with such a positive experience!

Scheduled a service with a set appointment time. Had to wait 15-20 minutes past my appointment time to even get checked in. Then the service took over an hour, and at the end of it the guy says, "by the way, did you notice your service engine light was on?" I told him yes that was one of the reasons I brought it in. He says, "oh, we couldn't do that today but you should really get it checked out soon."</Text>

Only complaint is that most automall service departments will cover the cost of the diagnosis if you use them for the repair. Autonation Honda charges the diagnosis on top of the repair.</review><resp>{'time': 1559925837907, 'text': 'Thanks so much for the warm recommendation of the team here at AutoNation Honda Roseville.

Jonathan Oconelle was our service adviser. he was super helpful.. we needed an oil change & get our brakes checked out because of a squeaking noise. though the wait was pretty long, his customer service made up for it.
he needs a promotion or a raise :) never been treated so well at a dealership.</Text>

We purchased a certified used Honda Civic and our Sales Person, Gary Neighbors, was great and easy to work with.  Our experience with the Finance Department initially was good until we had questions the next day about a warranty product we purchased and then decided to cancel.  Despite our repeated emails and calls to Mike Lazzara went unanswered.  About 7 days later we did get a call back from Eddie Xiloj who stated the warranty could not be cancelled despite my review of the sales agreement with no such language.  Eddie stated he would call me back as they want a happy customer and we never heard from him again.<//Text>

Parts buyers beware!

TL/DR: Here are some examples of the prices I used to get. LIST price is the ridiculously inflated price, ACTUAL is the online price I paid when this dealership would price match VS 2019 where they want to scam everyone like every other stereotypical sleazy dealership.

Ignition Switch (small harness with some wires and plastic connector) - LIST: $182.88, ACTUAL: $71.44 = SAVED: $111.44

Oil Pan - LIST: $195, ACTUAL: $77.12 = SAVED: $117.88

Both Headlights - LIST: $460.40, ACTUAL: $302 = SAVED: $158.40

Windshield Wiper Blade - LIST: $26, ACTUAL: $14.11 = SAVED: $11.89

That's the tip of the iceberg based just off receipts I could easily find.

A few years ago there was a great guy in the parts department at AutoNation Honda, I'll call him "P". I asked if he could price match reputable online Honda parts dealers, and his response stuck with me for years.

He was enthused at the idea, and mentioned how he liked the idea of keeping the money in the local Roseville/Sacramento economy instead of going off to various online based-companies, which is becoming the norm these days.

He had the right mindset, and I was able to come in frequently and blow tons of money on parts I didn't really need. He added a fair dollar amount to each of my orders to simulate what would have been a shipping cost if I had bought online.

Recently something has changed at Honda. I don't see "P" around anymore, and everyone at Parts rudely shuts down the concept of being competitive with their prices. I guess my money is going elsewhere.

Look at the latest uploaded photos for some of the (fair) prices I was getting for car parts in 2017-2018 vs what AutoNation Honda wants now. If you have the ability to do things yourself, I recommend doing as much of your own car work as possible. Buy your parts online (reputable Honda sites). There are great Youtube resources available for simple and more advanced repairs.

Zero stars for 2019 Roseville Honda. Shame on you guys. An ignition harness does not cost $180 and you know it.< /Review>

Peter was great!  He helped me through a very emotional process of getting rid of my huge gas hog SUV, and transition to a beautiful Honda Accord Hybrid. I now get about 600 miles on one tank of gas!  They also gave me a great deal on my trade-in, very fair. I would definitely come back to Honda Roseville.< /Text>

<review>I had the WORST experience ever in my car buying history with AutoNation Honda (I've purchased 12 cars in my life thus far). First, I had done a lot of research online and was ready to talk numbers so I called their sales number. I had to keep selecting the sales option because no one would pick up. After looping for 10 minutes, I decided to call and go through the Service Dept. A gentleman picked up, I told him what I was going through and he said he would get someone right away. I waited 3 more hours before I was done for the day at work and nobody called me back. I decided to stop by the dealership on my way home. No one greeted me on the sales floor and I had to ask a service employee walking by how I could get a sales person to help me. We went over to 3 young sales reps who were talking and cutting up in one of the open, door-less offices. One of them got up to help me and I explained to him that I was a serious buyer and ready to talk numbers. We went outside and picked out a car so we could work out the numbers. I gave him me and my wife's credit scores that were just pulled at another dealership 2 days before - even showed him the credit document. He then took the info over to "the deal desk" where they start playing the game of "How much can we make on this car and get this guy for?" The first numbers I got were absolutely ridiculous so I knew right then I was working with an old school "wheeling & dealing" dealership. I thanked the young guy politely and said the numbers aren't even close and I walked out.

The good news is I called Auburn Honda and got through on my first call. I told their numbers guy, Tom everything I told AutoNation and the numbers he gave me from the start were excellent. Matter of fact, he improved on the final payment because he went the extra mile to get me the best deal when the sale was finally done on our new Accord. I will be getting the word out of my experience through every online review option possible. In the end, it probably doesn't matter because these guys will just keep operating the way they do because they're in a great location and will take full advantage of anyone they can - they really don't care about the way they treat the consumer.< /review><pics>None</pics><response>{'time': 1536169784215, 'text': "Randy, thank you for leaving this detailed feedback about your experience with our dealership.

Friendly helpful staff, service department has been reliable and I have had no problems there.  Nice clean facility. Been doing business with them for 11 years now and been happy with them. Their mailed ads don't seem to track well with my services history though, so they keep suggesting things I've already taken care of.< /Text>

I'm very happy with the excellent care and service at AutoNation Honda Roseville.  Saman was very helpful, patient, and answered all my questions and concerns on that Sunday morning when I brought in my car with non repairable tire.  Being thousands of miles away from home, to say I was under stress would be an understatement; but Saman was calm and assuring and was able to find the exact match to replace two tires instead of all 4.  What a relief!!! Thank you Saman.</text>

< Review>
So helpful when you want to give them your money, but a NIGHTMARE when you're wanting a refund or decent customer service... In July 2017 I purchased a brand new Vehicle from this dealership. It was fast, easy, and great. I purchased an additional Honda Care Maintenance package at the same time to help maintain my vehicle. Since this time My family and I have moved several states away, and it is a significant inconvenience (Over an hour) to drive to the nearest dealership for vehicle maintenance. I decided to cancel my package for a refund since it was a service I would no longer be using. This is where it goes down hill.... On may 11th I called the dealership and spoke with a man named Eddie who got all my information and said he would email me all the paperwork to fill out and email back to begin the process. I waited and never received an email, so I called the next day to follow up and got a voicemail where I again left my information and informed him I hadn't received any emails. No call back. I called the following Monday and spoke with another Gentleman who said he would pass on my message to Eddie and apparently never did. This began a 3 month process of phone calls, voice mails, and leaving messages with other employees who I'm assuming never passed on my information. No answers, no returned calls, no refund. (Mind you these 3 months are all costing me a portion of my refund.)In early August I returned to Sacramento for a family emergency, and I took an afternoon to drive in and get the situation handled, or so I thought... I went in to the dealership and spoke with a man Named Kerry. I explained the situation and my frustrations and he was very apologetic and helped me to fill out all the paperwork to get sent in. He said the only problem that may arise was since the vehicle was not present they had no way to verify mileage, so he may contact me in a day or two if it posed a problem and I could send a photo of my odometer. I left pleased with my experience, but this was no where near the end... I never received any phone calls, so once I returned home I called and left a voicemail asking him to contact me so I knew if they needed the photo or not. Yet again, beginning a nearly 8 week process of phone calls, voice mails and messages. No contact, no call back, no refund. At 5 months in I was mad, annoyed and just felt completely disrespected. On Sept 27th I sent Kerry an email, reminding him who I was, what was happening and how irritated I was with the entire process. Later that morning I received a short email informing me he would look into it. After a few hours he called informing me they (the people who handle the refunds) were confused on the dates of the paperwork. (Kerry was great and put down the date of May 11th which I appreciated very much, on the refund because that was when I had begun the entire process, even though it was on August 6th that he formally put in the paperwork.) He said he had discussed it with them, and he would contact me as soon as he knew something, (which may take up to a week), but he was very apologetic. Well that week came and went, along with 4 more. I have followed up with phone calls and 2 more emails to which I have received no responses. I am now 1 week shy of a 6 MONTHS into a process which was supposed to take 4 to 6 weeks. I have been in constant contact with my lienholder who have received no paperwork, no refunds, nothing. I have literally received 1 call and 1 email during this entire miserable 6 month process, and neither one apparently did anything. I'm beyond frustrated, I am appalled with the entire process and how helpless and disregarded I feel. They jump thru hoops to sell you a car, but after that apparently you're on your own. If I could give 0 stars, I would. This whole experience has been exhausting, miserable, and beyond frustrating.

UPDATE:: After posting this and more emails and paperwork, I recieved my refund on Nov 29th. Still upset it took me having to post a negative review and be the 'bad guy' to get what was rightfully mine to begin with.</Review>

<UserId.>114770619056659195834</UserId.><Review>I was told that the oil change would take about an hour or so. I thought that was a little long just for oil change with an appointment time. Finally received my vehicle back 2 hours and 20 minutes later.

Update June 29 2019,  went in to get another oil change and surprisingly it was very quick. While I was waiting I happened to take a look at some other vehicles for a possible trade-in being that we had 2 pilots and didn't have the need for 2. Found the vehicle we liked and started the process (9am). After several hours we could not come to an agreement and sales person (Nick) got upset and became very rude. I approached a manager about the situation and was then given the deal I was asking for. I did end up with a new vehicle however it came with the worst car buying experience ever. Finally finished the process at around (8pm). Horrible, just horrible!< /Review></record>

My Mom, Dad and I have been loyal customers to Honda for quite a while(many years. Ray Turner is our favorite "to-go" sales rep. Highly recommend going to him to start/finish off a great deal and walk-out with the car you wanted!! I wouldn't refer him, or to go to this Honda dealership, if I didn't like the service. I'm a picky woman, and Ray helped my family and I get me the car I deserve and am fully satisfied with! You guys are the best!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<//Review>

The salesman wasted my time for hours. Finance guy was rude. Awful experience. I emailed the manager 2 weeks ago and have not received a reply. Don’t shop here. Go to Maita Honda, they offer a lifetime power train warranty.< /Text>

I was really disappointed this time with the service.  I had an appointment for oil change and service and to check a tire.  They knew I would wait for it.  5 1/2 hours later it was done.  The excuse was they had so many that were waiting for their cars and it was hard to find the slow leak in the tire.  Maybe they shouldn't book so many appointments.  Before this I have had ok service there.<//text>

Best place I've ever experienced to buy a car.  Great customer service and everyone I interacted with was very professional and kind.  Garry N (sales associate) walked my through the process quickly (including finance) and I was out of there in no time with the right car at a great price.  I'll be back for sure.< /Text>

I had a very nice experience getting a simple repair handled on my Pilot. Raj was courteous and even helped me by getting the price reduced so it was lower than my warranty deductible. I’ve had my Honda repaired twice at Roseville and have had excellent, no-pressure service both times.<//Review>

Raining cats and dogs, but that didn't stop Ray Turner from going out in the rain while I inspected the car.  Also, the original salesperson, who was not present when I came to see the car, sorry forgot her name, came over and congratulated me on my purchase of the very nice 2007 Corvette.  A pleasant buying experience with no high pressure sales tactics.<//Review>

<text>I elected to have routine service performed and was very specific on what I wanted (both verbally and in writing). Service advisor added items I didn't request and charged me for battery maintenance, tire rotation, air filter, $10 more than quoted for wheel alignment etc.  The advisor never went over the invoice until I requested a line by line explanation because the charges are not specifically listed.  I was suspicious because the bill seemed too high.  In the end I was credited back the $200 over charge after a meeting with the service manager. This is the third bad experience.  Previously I was told I needed a brake service.  I brought my car to two other repair companies and was advised brakes were fine.  I advised Honda and they invited me to come down to have them remeasured.  Because their initial measurement was inaccurate brakes pads were replaced at no cost.  On another visit I was told not to leave because tires were bad.  They quoted me a high price on tires.  I asked if there were any other options for tires and was told no.  I left and went to Les Schwab.  On my recent visit advisor was unprofessional, complaining about other advisors, that they were down staff and used inappropriate language (F word).  I gave two stars because Honda made it right, but my trust in their ability to be honest from the start is ruined.< /text>< username>

<Text>I recently purchased a 2018 Honda Civic from Coleman Harrigan and Michael Gonzales at Roseville Honda! It was the smoothest and best imaginable car buying experience! I was given all the information on my Honda and what I think was the best price offer, then I was walked through the rest. Dominick D’Aurizio also did a wonderful job presenting all the paperwork and warranty offers! Made me feel well taken care of!  It took only about 2-3 hours with all the test driving, talking, paper signing, and car polishing, washing, and inspecting.

Service Department: They kept me waiting even though my car was completed an hour before. I finally went to inquire if it was done. If I hadn't I would have been there till they closed. Worst of all they offered no apology just excuses and indifference. In addition they tried to sell me a battery and a transmission service. Neither were needed. The Battery was only two years old and working fine and I serviced the transmission my self less than 20,000 miles ago (usually it's done every 30,000). These are classic tactics in the auto repair world. Trans services and batteries are easy money and usually easy to sell. They sold a battery to an elderly woman sitting next to me based simply on the statement that it's charge was low. They mentioned nothing about the age of the battery (5-6 years is the average life of a car battery) or offered to put it on a charger instead of replacing it. I filled out a complaint but have yet to receive any response. I will NEVER go back to this place.<//Text>

<rate>2<//rate><Review>This poor review is specific to our experience with internet and Clarity salesperson Kristy L. at Honda AutoNation. We recently leased a Clarity FCV (vehicle runs on hydrogen fuel), Kristy did not notify us of the well-known and ongoing hydrogen fuel shortage in Northern California. She represented herself as an expert in the sales of Clarity vehicles, touting that she is the only one leasing FCVs, yet she is either unaware of or failing to inform customers of the hydrogen fuel shortage. In some parts of California, hydrogen fuel car owners have not been able to drive their cars at all (some for 3-4 months) due to lack of fuel and it will be weeks to months before the infrastructure can catch up.  We would NOT have gotten a hydrogen dependent car had we known all this and I feel Honda should make customers aware of the difficulties in obtaining hydrogen so they can make an informed decision about whether or not this car will work for them. Making this situation further frustrating is we originally went to get the plug-in Clarity, Kristy sold us on the hydrogen one saying it was a better deal since it came with free fuel (by the way the fuel is NOT free, it comes as the cost of your time and inconvenience).

In addition to the hydrogen fuel supply issues which we were not told about,  we were given defective Visa cards which were supposed to pay for the expensive hydrogen fuel (when it is available). When we told Kristy about the defective cards, her attitude was that of “it is not my problem”. She also gave us the car with barely any fuel. So in summary, we got a car delivered to us with little fuel, a defective fuel card and a state-wide shortage of fuel....but it is not her problem? We found her personality to be abrupt, uncaring and dismissive. I would not work with her again and cannot recommend her at all.

I am giving 2 stars because Sammy, a manager at this dealership, upon hearing of my concerns was apologetic and sympathetic. Unfortunately he can’t do anything about FCVs as they are only handled by Kristy (she won’t return emails now) and a gentlemen at corporate Honda (he thankfully does return emails).<//Review><pics>None</pics>< resp>

Best car buying experience I've ever had! Everyone was extremely kind and helpful, and we felt important and valued. I was apprehensive about buying a car... and was dreading going car shopping. This was so painless, and such a great experience.I will be coming here in the future when it's time to shop again. EVERY person we came across was respectful, kind, and considerate! Peter Sobczak was so fun to talk with and very personable. He took the time after to show us all of the ins and outs of our new car, and was happy to do so... excited for us even :).  Everyone here was wonderful! EVERYONE!  Thank you all!!!!!! Actually looking forward to future interactions as we will be completing all of our car services here. We were definitely taken care of, and this gives such an ease of mind for our future with this car and future services.   We LOVE our Honda Odyssey! Also, may be small to some... but they had great free coffee ;).<//Review>

I have  always gone to AutoNation Honda for service on my 15 y/o Honda. I am very happy that it has always been a good car, never gave me any problem or worry, and that is because of excellent service at the Honda service center. My experience proves that it is best to have my car serviced at the car brand service center, for reliability and accountability. I will  keep this car for as long as I am  able to drive, (I will be 76 y/o in November).
Thanks you for follow up. Thanks you to your "Honda Service Team" , for their apparent excellent "car-care" on my car.
Sincerely,
J.S.Manela</review>

But at Honda Roseville I left the lot truly feeling good. I was treated with respect and I was given a fair deal. Fair to both of us the dealer and me the buyer. The staff there are first rate. They know their products and they don't try and mislead you. I will shop for a car there again. P.S. this is my first Honda a CRV and we love it!</Text>< date>

My battery died in my 2016 Honda Accord with less than 36000 miles and less than  3 years. Autonation Honda not only replacement battery for free, they squeezed me in on a busy Thursday afternoon with no appointment.

If I could give it more stars, I would. Oscar G. was my salesman and he was absolutely amazing ! very knowledgeable, patient with my needs and the questions we asked. I am a full-time student and work full time as well, so my free time is limited and he made every moment count. I literally went in, took it for a test drive and took my NEW 2017 Honda Accord S home that day ! He followed up with me a couple days later to make sure I was still satisfied and even took the time to answer a few more of my concerns (LOVE). He made buying my first car such a good experience ! Make sure to ask for him, he's the best!</text>

<Text>Really, buying a car through AutoNation is the best way to go. The customer support is excellent and having them work directly through my credit union was a breeze. Really, I don't think I will buy a car any other way again. From the Roseville dealership to the AutoNation representatives to the financing department at my CU, this was a totally great - and painless! - experience.</Text><rating>5<//rating>< UserId.>

We had a very minor issue with our new car about 12 hours after driving it off the lot- a faulty switch. The service manager saw us, provided us with a rental right away, and got the issue resolved within hours. Not how we wanted to start our experience with the car, but they could not have been more apologetic, understanding, helpful, or accommodating.

<Time>1569544874438</Time><rate>1< /rate><Review>I purchased my 2013 Honda Accord certified used in 2015, long story short I had a bad excessive oil consumption issue going on. After countless times of visiting this dealership and repairs, this past week Honda decided to replace my engine yet make me pay a $100 deductible saying that this was due to carbon build up, I'm sorry but when I not only am still under a manufacturer warranty plus I spend 3k on an extended bumper to bumper warranty why should I have to pay a $100 simply and if I didn't like it I could escalate it corporate yet possibly loose that deal on the table. But it gets better unfortunately, I accidentally leave an AirPod in my rental they got for me, I notified them that it was in there, I could see on my cloud it was there, and asked them to look & retrieve it. Next morning magically my AirPods are no longer visible on "Find my iPhone" I call Apple asks what this means, they have informed me that my AirPod has been synced to a new device. I could get a subpoena from a court and then they could divulge the phone information of what they are synced to. I called countless times and no reply, drove down there, AirPod was gone & everyone said we will review footage and call tomorrow....low and behold no call. But wait it gets even BETTER, new engine, think everything would be solved right? Wrong, car stalls yesterday, I call Honda three times yesterday to see what they want me to do, they say all service advisors are busy and twice take down my name and number and say we will have someone call you back, which never happened either. I receive coincidentally an automated email from Autonation Les, so I think to myself maybe this is a sign to just call this person and deal with all of this, leave him a message at 1pm yesterday, no call back. Well car stalls two more times, same repeat issue, call the dealership, told the same thing from a person all reps are busy they will call me back, 4 times. No call back. Finally I hit the sales prompt and see if that gets  me anywhere, it did but in such a not so amazing way. I get a service rep calls me within 5 minutes after hanging up with a sales person. The service rep decides to complaint to me how she got yelled at for not calling me back and how was she supposed to call me back with no message, most unprofessional call I have ever received. So here I am again, no car, towed back to AutoNation today, stolen AirPods, and considering myself lucky if I can get an individual to call me back just with the basic of getting my car there to be fixed again, if they won't call me back about my car I'm sure they won't attempt to call over a stolen airpod. Yes, I should've checked my car better and not been in such a hurry dropping my vehicle off so my three kids could make it to practice on time, but lesson learned not all people are honest if they come across something that isn't theirs and to try to not leave my items behind so this doesn't happen again.</Review><pics>None</pics>< response>

I recently bought a Honda Accord coupe from Honda AutoNation and I love my new Car!
Jake Newman assisted us with everything and answered all questions we had, he was very polite and professional. Despite that my dad was arguing about various details, he still remained calm and tried to explain why and how everything works. Definitely loving the experience with Honda AutoNation and will definitely be back to buy my sister a car from there!
-- Thank you.< /Text>

<text>Worst experience ever!! I use to love Honda and thought they would do anything and everything for me...I was so wrong. I've had problems with my 2016 Civic within the first month of purchasing it. I've had to get my car serviced multiple times for the same problem and I'm beginning to think that they sold me a lemon? Tried to contact so many managers and just keep getting the run around on what they can do for me, which is nothing. So disappointed, I can't wait to get rid of my Honda.</text>< date>

I love your Roseville Honda at Automation!  Ray Turner, the sales rep , was absolutely correct when he said that I do not need to look elsewhere.  The price of my Accord was the best in the state.  I have had Accords since 1994.  And, this one was the best experience of them all.  I will continue to have them as my dealer for the future Hondas.  Thank You!<//text>

<Rating>3</Rating><Text>We almost left, my wife and I were ready to purchase a honda odyssey and went to the dealership late afternoon on laborday weekend. We parked and went to look at the vans. We decided we wanted to go and test drive it. No salesman have approached us yet so we walked to the front doors where there were about 10 sales people standing there talking among themselves. Noone acknowledged us, my wife and I are looking at each other in disbelief. Finally we ask if we can test drive the van, suddenly all the sales reps start to scatter saying they are busy. My wife and I are baffled and are about ready to leave untill one of the sales rep Tarek steps up the the plate even tho he was helping someone else at the same time. The only reason i give it 3 stars is because of Tarek. The test of the sales people that day were just plain rude. After that the transaction went smoothly and Tarek and the Financial department were really nice and informative.<//Text><Pics>None</Pics><response>{'time': 1567452326744, 'text': 'Hi Joe, we appreciate you taking the time to respond.

Kudos to Autonation Honda.  When I arrived there were no less then 20 cars ahead of me in line.  I was a little concerned on the wait time for my service but I was greeted right away and my service advisor was fast and professional.  The service I requested was completed in the time I was quoted.</Review>

<review>I went into the dealership with my own funding, and without my permission they pulled my credit.  Very unprofessional in the way they handled my auto buying experience, and there was no communication between people that were handling my case. I spoke with 4 different people when buying my car and told each one of them not to pull my credit, that I had my own financing. Each one treated me like I need to go through their fiancé department, which I did not. My bank told me that with my pre approval it would be like I was walking into the dealership with cash... this was far from the case.< /review>< GmapID>

<Review>I have owned multiple Honda’s over the past 30 years.  I’ve always had great service until a few weeks ago. My husband took his ridgeline in because there was some smoke coming out of the engine. They said the pistons were misfiring and fixed the problem for $1300.  We were told that we pretty much had a new car.  Two weeks later and the truck is smoking 10x worse than before.  My husband popped the hood to find a plastic piece rubbing on a belt smoking....it was the cover to a “hole” they use when checking for problems.  I’m really not clear of its purpose.  We took the truck back to Roseville Honda and were told there was something wrong with the engine, but they didn’t know what and would have to send it out.  Not only that, but we were told it would cost $6800 for a new used engine.  We can almost buy a new used car for that much money.  We took our truck in when it was “sick” and were given back something that was “sicker” and asked to pay almost $7000.  I am beyond sad.  We’ve never received service like this at any other Honda dealer.  Hoping it is a fluke.<//Review>< pictures>

We went around to a lot of dealers before deciding on a Honda from autonation, and they were by far the most respectful, friendly and helpful team we worked with. I tried to go through the reviews to see if i recognized the name of our first salesman there, but I can't recall it for the life of me. However Will W helped me once my car got delivered from Davis and was super patient while explaining how to use the radio and whatnot without talking down to me or rushing through. Jeff from financing was also super friendly and made all the paperwork stress free. Overall I had a very pleasant car buying experience<//text>

Jake greeted us out in the lot and asked what we were looking for. He was very helpful in explaining all of the specs and upgrades with all of the Civics and Accords. He gave us time and space to check things out for ourselves so we'd never feel pressured. After explaining how much we would actually be paying for a brand new Civic, we were convinced and decided to buy one. We even went with a higher model than we'd originally planned for because the deals were that good. When it came to the paperwork, Jake and Jeff made it really easy and transparent. This was a completely different experience when we got a car that wasn't through AutoNation. I know I'll be getting my next Honda at this dealership in the future.</text><Rating>5< /Rating></record>

<text>With any car buying experience there will always be pros and cons; I am happy to say that our experience was very good.

We recently leased a Odyssey for AutoNation Honda.  Luron (Ray) Turner was our point of contact/sales rep and was helpful through the entire process.  He was the best part of the experience.  Ray emailed me several times, at my request, to show me current deals on the vehicles that we were considering.

The person who took us through the paperwork was thorough and got us out as quick as possible.

As per my past experiences at all dealerships, the entire process of securing the vehicle can take several hours; then again they have a lot of information to process.

The facility is clean, they have the best selection in our area, and we were never given a hard sell.  It actually took us two months to come to a decision from the first time we walked on the lot.  Ray was patient and never pushy.

I think you will be pleased with your experience.</text>< name>

At AutoNation Honda I had the most satisfying Car buying experience I ever  had buying an automobile. My salesman , Gary was not high pressure and handled me with a caring professionalism.  From  my initial quoted price on line, until I signed  my final contract .  I was not pressured in any way. All of the personnel from Caitlin at the reception desk to the managers that I met were courteous , friendly and professional.. AutoNation Honda rated a FIVE for me in all aspects of the sale. I love my new Honda EX Sedan.< /text>

We purchased a 2014 Honda Pilot this past week from AutoNation Honda Roseville, and the staff at Honda were great!

We felt like we got an honest deal, and a very fair value for our trade-in.

Going into a dealer can be stressful sometimes, but at Roseville Honda they are so friendly and relaxed that we got comfortable right away. We dealt with Gary P. and he was outstanding. Although we were not sure when we went in what we wanted to buy, they let us take our time and gave us plenty of space. There was no pressure, and just the opposite, they seemed to really care that we made the decision that was best for us.....which was refreshing.

Going through the paperwork with the finance person Marco at the end (which can be tiresome) went smooth and efficient. He did a great job of going through all the costs and details so we were comfortable with everything.

Can't recommend these guys enough. Thank you! ....and love the car!<//text>

They fixed the rattle free of charge and got the new tires on an hour before the quoted time. Service is alway exceptional at this place and prices are comparable or less then a non-dealership.

The worst Honda car buying experience I've ever had.  I've been trying to purchase a car from them for the past week and I have not had a call back about the status.  I've even offered to provide my own financing.  Now, for some unknown reason, no one picks up the phone in sales or has the courtesy to call back.  If you don't want to sell the car, that's fine too, just let me know.  But it's pretty messed up for you to pull my credit and everything and not sell the car.</text>

There was no haggling over price and they had the exact vehicle I wanted. I had waited 2 months for a local dealer to get what I wanted and when told 2 more weeks, I called around and found it that day in Roseville. Salesman was polite and courteous. He made sure we were comfortable and checked in regularly on the progress of the financing.  If purchasing a new car, I would definitely consider Honda of Roseville.< /Review><pics>None</pics><Response>None</Response><gmapID>0x809b1f8cb7689c85:0xfd027cebb953408</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Rich Amader is perhaps one of the best service advisors that I had the chance to work with for the service of my vehicle, he is quick yet able to review the service history and ONLY recommended what is necessary. He updated me on the status of the service and very personable as well. Highly recommended.< /Text>

I arrived 15 minutes early and had to wait in my car until 8am before being taken care of.

The whole process was very professional and the staff were pleasant to talk to.  The facility is really nice and clean with coffee available while you wait. Because my job was going to take a little longer than normal, they gave me a ride home. Nice to do business with a "customer first" company.</Review>

Had a great experience with AutoNation! The salesperson was very helpful and attentive to my questions about the SUV that I was interested in, which allowed me to make the decision to purchase.  The loan process  also went pretty smooth and the loan representative explained everything very clearly.  Was very happy overall working with AutoNation and am very happy with my new SUV!<//text>

Needed service done to my car. Raj was extremely helpful and professional. He helped me understand everything and the service was done very quickly. I would recommend Honda Roseville. Thanks again Raj.</text>

<Date>1519598481807</Date><rating>2</rating><Review>Called on a Wednesday to make an appointment for an oil change the following Saturday.  Called again on Saturday before the appointment and had to change times due to an emergency.  I was informed we didn't actually have an appointment because of a system error but they could help us out and scheduled for Sunday.  I drove 45 minutes and made my scheduled appointment time only to find out they didn't make the appointment again.  They turned us away because they were short staffed and rescheduled for next week...
They get a 2 only because the receptionist was nice< /Review>< pics>

<text>Service wait times are extremely long and an oil change takes upwards of two hrs. Very courteous staff though. They usually have bagels and a free coffee machine with TV in the wait area. So waiting is really not that bad. They do not push additional services down your throat like the other places do. Sales staff is good as well. Bought my Odyssey from here at a great price.< /text>< Pics>

The entire team at Auto Nation Honda was very easy to work with. They make you feel like part of the family the minute you walk in. I was in and out in no time with everything I was looking for.  I highly recommend Auto Nation in Roseville if you are looking for a new or used car.<//review>

Peter @ AutoNation Honda Roseville. My first time buying a car from a dealership, so I was very nervous. He understood that and worked slowly with me, he didn't harass me to buy like other salesmen I met that day at different dealerships.  Everyone at Honda took their time and were very respectful. If I ever need another car I will be going to AutoNation Honda.< /Review>

I like how the cars are all open so you can get a feel for what it would be like if you owned it. Its 90 percent of the experience of owning a vehicle. Hate it when  car dealerships have every vehicle locked.<//text>

<Text>I had such a great experience at this Honda dealership! I went in to buy a new 2015 Fit and the entire staff was supremely friendly and helpful. The people that helped me were Jake, Wes, and Sonny. Jake facilitated the test drive - which I always find a little awkward since getting used to driving a totally new car can be a little rough - and he was so nice and answered all of my questions.

Sonny and Wes in particular were so knowledgable, professional, and helpful it blew me away. This was my first time buying a car and they never made me feel rushed or uninformed. They answered all of my questions, took their time with me, and in the end gave me the best possible car and warranties for my needs. 2015 Fits were nearly out of stock all over California when I decided to buy, and before I even came in, Sonny helped me track down and get into stock the exact car that I wanted. He gave me an explanation of financing and advised me on what the pros and cons were of buying vs lending. Wes, our financial guy, explained every part of the warranty for me and allowed me to make the bottom line decisions about which warranties I did or didn't want.

Overall, the entire time I felt like I was getting advice from good friends instead of getting pushed to buy something from a salesperson. I have endless appreciation for the transparency, honesty, helpfulness, and friendliness that everyone at this dealership exuded! I cannot recommend them highly enough. Go see Sonny, you won't regret it!<//Text><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>{'time': 1444084564964, 'text': 'Thank you for your kind words! We always strive to provide personable and excellent customer service.

Experience was good. AutoNation was good in honoring the price negotiated via emails before the visit. When we got to the dealer, everything was ready. Took a quick test drive and Michael Cunha was very detailed in explaining the features. Wanted to add the body side molding but would not want to have to go back at another time for installation because we had to drive all the way from San Francisco. Michael was able to get the service department to have it installed while we were doing the financing paper work. There were no hard sells for anything else besides what we agreed upon. He was also detailed in walking us through again with the features of the car before we took of. Overall, this was a very good experience.<//review>

My experience was wonderful from start to finish! I was skeptical that I would get a new car when I went in because I had an older car to use as a trade, but the team at AutoNation Honda made it work for me! Proud new owner of a 2017 Honda Civic now. Thanks to Peter and Ray and all the managers who helped out!< /Review>

<rating>5< /rating><review>Peter quoted us a great price on a 2017 Honda Pilot over the 4th of July weekend. By the time we bought our car on 9/9/2017, the price had gone up. When Peter realized his quoted price was $5000 less than the actual price, he told us that he & AutoNation would honor the decreased price they originally quoted.  Peter didn't hesitate to say, "It's what I promised you - we'll stand behind that." We will go through Peter and AutoNation the next time we buy a car. Their integrity and service were amazing!</review>< userid>

I leased my Honda 2 years when I did not have a credit score. They told me that after two years I could come back, recheck my credit score and lower my monthly payment. After two years I call, explain the situation, and they made the appointment. I had to ask for a day of vacation and drive to Roseville. When I got to the dealer they explain that what they told me two years ago is not right and they don’t it. So I ask if I could downgrade to a smaller car so I can pay less. After all the paper work, 2 hours waiting, they come back and say that if I pay $2.000, and I pay the same monthly payment they will do the extraordinary favor of letting me downgrade to a smaller car.<//Text>

<text>I waited over 3 hours for an oil change, complimentary car wash, and a relatively simple battery sensor recall.  When I made the appointment, I was told it would be 2 hours.

The complimentary wash looked so rushed...  my rims weren't cleaned nor where the rocker panels, (the body-colored inside part you see when getting into the car.)

I'm only giving two stars because I at lease got my car back before the end of the day.< /text><pics>None< /pics><response>{'time': 1500791236101, 'text': "Duane, thank you for leaving this detailed feedback about your experience with our dealership.

I took my car in today because of a recall letter that I received, the people are wonderful but I didn't appreciate that they changed my settings in my car.  If they needed to that is fine but just let me know.  I have only owned the car for about a month.   I love my car but I hope I don't have too many recalls.<//Review>

I had a family member that just went in again today... they lost his credit application twice ...he was dealing with a salesperson named Gabe, and over a week of coming in and asking for more information all they were doing is giving him the runaround. The finance person also got involved and he also gave him the runaround. I can't believe that his credit application was lost twice they're asking him to fill out another credit application. We are now thinking of going and asking for legal advice on how to handle this since they have lost his credit information and personal information. Having personally bought  a vehicle from #AutoNation corporation I am so surprised that #AutoNation  would allow their  location to do this to customers. I'm also surprised that #Honda is allowing this to happen. Very concerned that supposedly they lost a credit application twice with valuable personal information on it.</text>< Pics>

< Review>
I made an appointment with Sammi regarding about my infotainment screen on my new 2018 Honda Clarity. I came in that day and he thought I was talking about my windshield because I said there were some cracks on my screen. While he did say sorry, he took some pictures of my infotainment screen and told me I will get in contact with the service manager to see what we can do. It has been almost a week and yet I didn't receive a phone call from him nor the service manager. I did call Sammi/Sammy and left a voicemail a couple of times and yet no reply back yet. Pretty disappointed taking in to the fact that this is my first time going to the service department.

EDIT: They fixed my trim issue but went back to due lights on the car and wanted to charge $150 for diagnose fee even though I’m under my 36,000 miles warranty. In short terms don’t go to them.<//Review>

I've been going to Mel Rapton Honda where I was always taken well care of. I moved recently to Roseville and was debating on whether I should continue to take my 2017 Accord to Mel Rapton or try Auto Nation. I am Happy i went with the latter. Jonny was excellent and for not having an appointment was able to get me in and out as fast as he could.<//Text>

<Review>I recommend this place to everyone! GREAT service!
I had a horrific experience with Paul Blanco and almost settled for a car I didn't even want bc my credit is damaged due to a recent issue with identity theft. Matt from AutoNation called me an hour before I went to PB to make the deal...and Thank God! He was able to find a way to help me with a car that I DID want.
I went right in and Lyn  was absolutely amazing! She explained every detail and went out of her way to get the deal that I could afford. I drove away in a 2019 Honda Civic in the color I have always wanted.</Review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

This will be the second vehicle I've purchased from Autonation Honda, and both times have been a great experience. Walter (salesperson) was professional, friendly and very knowledgeable about Honda products. Unlike other dealerships I've dealt with in the past, there was no haggling or up selling of anything. Just straight forward and efficient.
Thanks again for all your help, you guys do great work.< /Text>

< Review>
We had a surprisingly pleasant experience with AutoNation Honda Roseville. I've been a lifelong Toyota driver and had totally sworn off of all Hondas until I fell in love with a used CR-V at another dealer that was a much higher trim than we were looking for or could afford. We decided to check out Roseville Honda because they seemed to have a lager selection of used CR-Vs to choose from. We came in to look at one of their used CR-Vs, but it didn't have all of the features we were looking for. We saw another one on the lot that came so close to hitting the mark - it had everything I wanted, but didn't have AWD. They worked with us until we found the exact combination of features at a price that we could afford. We worked with Nick and he was a total sweetheart. We hadn't planned on purchasing that day and never in my wildest dreams would I have imagined that we'd purchase a BRAND NEW car, but they made us an offer we couldn't refuse and we feel really good about the decision to purchase with Roseville Honda. Everyone was really warm and I never felt pressured along the way. All around it was a great experience for something that can be potentially so scary and anxiety producing.</Review>

<review>This is a review for their SALES team and not the service department. My wife and I are planning to get a CRV and all we wanted to do was - test drive the CRV and pick it up in 15 days since I am moving back to Sacramento mid July. They would not even disclose the price without a commitment to buy. Pushed us to buy it today itself and offered CRAZY discounts only if we can buy today (no idea what that discount was). This was a complete and utter waste of time. I've dealt with multiple dealerships in the past and this was the worst experience ever. How do you expect to buy a car without knowing how much it costs? I told him we are selling at MSRP is also a valid answer, but they won't even say that. Finally after sitting there for almost 45 mins (this is after the test drive) they bring in another sales associate who asks "So, What do you plan to accomplish today?" This is when we got up and left. Drove straight to another dealership and got a quote within 5 minutes. Would definitely bring this quote back and see what their CRAZY discount is.
I wonder if they know about Truecar and other sites that disclose the prices and that the customer is now more informed than ever.
PS: 5 stars for the guy who took us on the test drive. after that everything went down hill.<//review><pics>None<//pics><Response>{'time': 1562378210588, 'text': "Thanks Prabhat, for leaving us this response.

I purchased my new 2013 Honda Accord Sport here because of the excellent service.  The sales, financing and service departments treated us well.  No high pressure sales here.  They let the car sell itself.  The paperwork went smoothly and the car was ready to drive away as we finished the last signature.

Thanks AutoNation</review>

I came on desperate to find a new car as my old one still had a car payment and soon would be unable to drive. I came in no idea what I was looking for just something affordable and Danny made sure I found it. I came in with only two hours between my shift to finish paperwork and he made it happen and I'm so in love with my new 2017 Honda Fit<//review>

Setting up a service appointment is easy.  The service advisors are able to attend to you in a reasonable amount of time and the car is often ready by their estimated time of completion.  I always request the complimentary car wash when I have my car serviced and they do a decent job cleaning the car.

Most of the services that I've had done were for regular maintenance check-ups and I have no complaints.</Text>

<Rating>5</Rating><Review>Just wanted to share our experiences with Autonation Honda in Roseville.
Our sales rep was named Samuel. Sam went above and beyond anything we ever experienced with a salesman before. His professionalism, his kindness and compassion were outstanding!
Our insurance company required us to have the car at their office, we couldn't take the car without proof of insurance. Sam went out of his way to come pick us up at home in Antelope, then drive us to the insurance company where we had to wait nearly 4 hours to get proof of insurance. Sam even had to go back to the dealership and return with the contract just to satisfy the insurance company. So much hassle and Sam took it all in stride!
I can't find the words to describe how fantastic we were treated here.
Sam and Geoff helped us into a new 2017 Civic LX. We couldn't believe it, and we couldn't be happier!!
We have already recommended this dealership and staff to relatives and friends.

Thanks so much!

< Review>
I had a B1 (oil change and tire rotation) service appointment. After arriving, I told the service advisor about my B1 appointment, and when we went to his desk, I told him again that I wanted an oil change and tire rotation. He wrote it down but never gave me a copy of the pre-estimate. I didn’t mind that everything will take 3.5hrs to finish. I just asked him also for a car wash before I left, which he agreed to.

I got a call and said that it was finished. I signed the paperworks and paid for it, but wasn’t able to check what’s written on the final estimate.

When I walked to the car, it wasn’t even washed. When I got home, the estimate only showed the oil change, and charged some additives I didn’t request (window washer, MOA). Worse, there was no sign from the estimate of the tires being rotated.

Also, I had to remind the advisor again of the coupon that I have, which I showed initially, and he still ended up forgetting to add it on the invoice.</Review>

When my boyfriend was buying his brand new Civic they were very friendly and helpful. They told us anything the car needed bring it right to them. The second the paper work was signed that charade was over. We tried to bring it in for an oil change they told us they would need to keep the car for 2 days because they were busy. There's been a light on the dash. We don't know what it means and no one will answer the phone too help us. I called them earlier because the car needs coolant and I need to know what kind to put in after 3 phone calls I was finally transferred to James.... His voicemail anyway. I left him the message explaining that I need to know what kind of coolant to put in and six hours later still no reply. I was very interested to buy my own because I love the car but I will never buy through this dealership< /Review>

I purchased a new 2016 Honda Pilot EX-L at AutoNation Honda Roseville. My experience was great, Ray made the purchase easy and helpful. Eddy at the finance was very friendly as well. Ray even went out with me to the rental car center and helped me return my rental car. Great service and experience! Keep up the good work!< /Text>

<review>I have been going to Auto Nation Roseville since I bought my CRV-Exl in 2009, and have always had fantastic service.  On 6/16/19.  I had the worst service ever.  I took it in for oil change at 10 am, and then we going to check out a vibration at 230pm, No one called me to give me an update.  I called their office 4 times and was transferred to the Service office and it rang and rang and then hung me up.  On my 5th try, I got an adivsor, who then promised to call me back after he checked with the mechanic, NEVER got a call until 430pm, and which then I was told additional work needed to be done, but of course too late to have it done.  When my husband complained they gave me the oil change free, but I am So So upset about the level of service I received.  This is Not the quality I expect at AutoNation..</review><rate>2<//rate>< Name>

I spoke to Sami, who made me an appointment for 12:30 pm. I got there 15 minutes prior to my appt, but there was a huge line of cars that wasn’t moving. I called Sami to say sorry but I’m going to miss my appt. He came right out and checked me in. Ok that was awesome so far. Sami did tell me we are busy so plz be patient and we will get your car taken care of.
So I went to the customer waiting area, which was very uncomfortable and a mess. But I was able to use their WiFi and watch Netflix and play my game. Well after two hours I found out my car had three cars in front of mine. I was in desperate need of a pedicure. Sami ordered the shuttle for me and the young man (who was so sweet and helpful) first took me to the atm then to my nail appt.
After my appt, I contacted Sami again for a return ride. He was with a Customer and I couldn’t reach him, but I left a message. After about a half hour I called again and Sami said he ordered the shuttle and if they weren’t there in 20 min, he would pick me up himself. I was considering Lyft at this point, but didn’t want to spend the money.
So about 15 min went by and one of the technicians picked me up. He said he was throwing away some tires and was told go pick up 5his customer lol. He was also very sweet and helpful oh and funny.
I got back to Honda and my car wasn’t washed yet but Sami had it run through and it runs beautiful. AutoNation has excellent customer service. Everyone I came in contact with treated me like I was the only customer they had. Other than the long wait the visit was awesome. I was glad to get my car and go home.< /text>< pictures>

Test drove two different Honda models and purchased a vehicle.  The salesperson was friendly and helpful.  No pressure to buy. They told me about an added manufacturer discount on top of their own dealer discount.  Took 2 hours from decision to purchase to drive home. Unfortunately, the Honda had paint defects and had to be returned--not the dealerships fault though would have been nice if they caught the paint defect earlier.<//review>

The service department did a good job in doing the work; but I forgot to use my 15% discount coupon during the write-up and the company refused me to give me the credit (which would have amounted to about $150.00) that I should have deserved on the payment.< /Review>

<user_name>Alicia Echevarria< /user_name><text>I was in the market for a car and thought I would give shopping on-line a try this time around.  It was the easiest experience in car buying ever.  I got several quotes from different dealerships including auto west.  They matched the lowest quote I had AND the internet sales person, Chris, that was helping me had great customer service.  Service and experience is a HUGE part of what will earn my business and Auto West surpassed their Honda neighbors by far.  He asked questions to get to know about me and my family, and once we went in to test drive, he had some paperwork started, the car pulled up and ready for me to take it for a spin.  Because I had already done my research and homework online, the experience at the dealership was fast and so easy.  Everybody there was so helpful, they smiled and said hi as you walked by and left no questions unanswered.  I know a lot of these seem like service expectations, but let me tell you...we went One other dealership prior to going out to Roseville and their service was horrible.  We have purchased two cars from Auto West now and will give them our business again when the time comes again in the future.<//text><rating>5<//rating>< Date>

They never touched my vehicle until almost 1:30 with no explanation and me just sitting waiting. So I talked to my service advisor to see why and  I was given a rental vehicle and was called back about 2 hrs later saying my vehicle was ready to go and fixed. Well I show up and the seal is still sticking out the door and not attached all the way and the key still does not unlock the door even though the said it was ready. So I had to wait about 15 more mins for my vehicle.  They told me they did a multi point inspection on my vehicle and adding fluids to what needed it. Well they did not do that.  My windshield wiper fluid is still empty. Also they never answer the phone when you call.<//Text>< Pics>

my 2015 pilot was not detailed very well.  Still found a lot of water stains on the seats.  I have to find a place that can get the water stains out.  some of the plastic has sticky substance on it from the previous owner.  My sales person was very good.<//Text>

<Text>While the people are friendly and the service quick I was extremely disappointed in my fee multi-point check. I was told that I need new brake pads, transmission fluid, a battery and new tires. All of those things were completed only 6 weeks ago by my husband (save the tires, those do need to be replaced). My husband called the service department to talk to the technician about their report because he felt they were taking advantage of me as a woman by telling me I need services I do not need. The service manager on my case, Nelson, told my husband he would get with the tech and call him back. But Nelson nor the tech ever called back to discuss the findings. This only confirms that they did in fact lie to me about my vehicle needing those things and likely didn’t even check a thing on my car. They simply saw I was about to reach 100,000 miles and put down the services I need based on that. I definitely would not recommend going to this location if you are a woman and alone. They will not do a thing for you or for your vehicle.< /Text>< Pics>

Jake was prompt, efficient and very accommodating in helping me find my preferred trim and color. He found the last one in stock and reserved it for me. It was ready to go when I arrived that weekend to test drive and Jake helped process my information quickly. My experience with Marco Xiloj in finances was just as positive.

<Rating>1</Rating><Text>After 3 years, I decided to give AutoNation Honda another chance when shopping for a plug-in hybrid. Because of convenience, I test drove the car with them and started negotiations via email and text with their Clarity sales rep, Kristy. She was much more responsive than reps from Folsom Lake and Maita Honda!

Decided to continue negotiations with AutoNation and, as expected, their first offer was ridiculous! We eventually arrived at a number via email that worked and completed the deal with little delay. I also sold them my 2015 4Runner, and they told me I should be receiving a check in 5-7 days (from the date of the sale: Sept 5th). I had the title, so there should have been no problem meeting this deadline.

Unfortunately, it is now 19 days later, and still no check. After 8 days passed, I called to speak with someone in finance and left a message. After no response, I called back the next day, and they still couldn't connect me with someone over the phone. Decided to go into the dealership at Day 10 (Saturday), and was told that my lease was not funded yet, but "corporate was closed until Monday". On Monday, I was told that I needed to re-sign a new contract because the original contract was missing the last digits on the VIN for my 4Runner! The finance guy missed it even though it was a known "glitch" in the system. I'm sure Honda is working hard to fix this glitch, while it gives them an excuse to hold onto thousands of dollars from their customers... Interest accrued for them!

I came in that same day and signed a new contract. No offer of service and hardly an apology for their error. The original finance guy made excuses for the issue after I spoke with another finance manager who said the error was known and should have been caught. I expressed my displeasure to their sales manager and he offered me a tank of gas.... ON A PLUG-IN HYBRID. I told him that I haven't used any gas in the 2 weeks since I bought it and do not plan on using a tank of gas in the next year, but he said there was nothing he could do! My sales rep is more concerned about how I am going to review my experience with Honda's customer survey. Shouldn't I be encouraged to be honest? How else can they fix their issues?

Another week has passed since re-signing the contract, and still no check for my 4Runner! It has been 19 days, which is unacceptable! I was quoted 5-7!<//Text>< pictures>

<text>I bought  a used Honda odyssey  from Honda autonation about  3 months ago i only drove it for 1000 milles, i took it for service at other dealer bcas going from a trip vacations and they told me needs a timing belt  what it's  gonna cost me close to 2000 dollar, the vehicle  is already past do 20,000 miles for that service that could've done before they sale it and now i have to spend 2000 dollar more? That is not good, i when to buy a car from a dealer to not have this kind of issues, i think they need to do it but they said they don't  have to. To be honest im not coming back there, my brother just bought a brand new odyssey from them if i knew before , for sure not going there, after this im telling my family and friends not to go there, hope someone call me from there and say they gonna fix it with out cost, that'll change my mind about that experience.<//text><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>{'time': 1558556840449, 'text': 'We strive to maintain excellent business relations at our dealership.

<text>The service advisor was very thorough in explaining what was needed, and options.  Since I travel a good deal, I am quite experienced with “good” service advisors, and (sadly) a LOT of advisors that were very lacking in that communication.

Not only did Bobby give me options, he handled things immediately!  Not, “I’ll call you and let you know.”
Not only did we arrange for a lengthy service, but AutoNation provided a rental car from Enterprise, which also was taken care of immediately!

Upon returning to pick up my vehicle, Bobby was equally efficient, but thorough, to be sure that I understood everything that was done to my Honda.  He was polite, walked me to my vehicle, and made sure I was satisfied...
How about 6 stars, instead of 5?
Outstanding service and outstanding personnel!

Came in Wednesday evening to browse the 2017 Civic Touring and was approached by David. Super friendly from beginning to end, and made the whole experience worthwhile, as he was very knowledgeable about the Civic Touring. Went throughly in details about the car's specs, showing us how to go about navigating all the tech, features and what to expect. He was able to answer all the questions and concerns that I had. Being a first-time new car buyer, you could only imagine how hesitant I was about coming in, but David made it a great experience. We also ran into Jeff in the Finance, department, and again a pleasant process going into the finance portion of buying a new car. Overall, I am very pleased with my purchase. Thank you David and Jeff!</Text>

<review>I had a very pleasant experience here.  Worked through Truecar to get a quote and set up an appointment.  Keith Denault reached out to me by email and phone.  He was very helpful through the entire process.  I had some time constraints to work through and the whole dealership took ownership and helped me.  They arranged a loaner car to use while my car was being detailed and cleaned up.  Jeff Kissiar sped through the finance side of things and gave me options for extended warranty, etc... without coming off as too pushy.  They worked with me to keep my payment where I wanted.  Keith and Mike Cunha have been very helpful answering questions and taking care of minor issues since I have had the car.  All in all,  an easy, no hassle car-buying experience.< /review>< pictures>

Ross, the service advisor, was very nice and professional. He got my car on board with all the Maintainance needed. It came back with 1 issue that we need to work on asap and another one that can wait. He explained everything and we moved forward. Good experience. Brian Alexander also was very courteous to explain some options in the 2017 v6 accord and the touring model.< /Review>

First off I did not go in with the full intention of coming home with a new car. I had a 2016 Kia Soul but I wanted to see what my trade in value was and what options I had. So Tarek (Derek), was the person who assisted me with looking into what my options were. I was debating between a Civic or HRV I look at both then decided to test drive the Civi and I loved it. So we then went inside and I decided well why not. I ended up trading my car in and boom now I have a 2019 Civic Sport just like I wanted.</text>

I recently purchased a gently used certified pre owned 2013 Honda Civic from AutoNation Honda. From my first interaction with my salesman Steven Jackson I knew I was in good hands. He was very knowledgeable and interested in selling me the car I was looking for. All without any of the typical car salesman B.S. He listened to what my budget was and was able to give me a no pressure quote that worked for me. Then they let me go home and think about it and decide if it was right for me. That was the first time that has ever happened. This was a refreshing change to what I have experienced elsewhere. At other dealerships I have been told this quote disappears if you don't drive it home today.  This is the second car I have bought from this dealer. When I am ready for another car I will be coming back to see Steven.< /text>

Our service rep Raj provided superiors service to us in servicing our 2009 Honda Accord.  His knowledge of the Honda engine and features was remarkable.  We'll always ask for Raj because of his professionalism and superior customer service.< /Review>

Overall very great. Our sales guy, Michael Lazzara, is very personable and informative. Every question we asked he either knew or was able to find out very easily. He stayed with us through the whole process and did not push anything on us which I greatly appreciated. The whole process of buying a car was made much easier by shopping here. I found the car online and I am very glad I chose this dealership to buy my new used car through :) Thank you all!<//review>

I have purchased multiple vehicles from Autonation Honda. Why? Great selection and their fleet and internet sales department prices can't be beat. I'm not as impressed with the regular sales department though.

If you're looking for a new Honda, go to the internet or fleet sales department. They will work with you without the high pressure sales tactics.< /text>

<text>Buying a car is never easy as a single person.  Because of a referral from a friend to AutoNation I gave them a shot and was more than impressed with the service and ease of discussing my needs with the sales folks.   The finance person was extremely nice and seem to have my best interest at heart.  I owed Toyota's for almost 25 years, I am now sold on Honda's.  Thank you!< /text>< Pics>

They are very helpful in serving helping you finding what you’re looking for and going about it in a way that’s most satisfying and stress-free. Instead trying to persuade to do something I wouldn’t have wanted to do, they gave me information based on any questions that I had and helped me stay focus on the path I wanted to take. They didn’t try to convince me to look at any brand spanking new cars nor get any added feature for my car. Sure they mentioned about leasing a new car because I am military and I would be able to return the vehicle for free or pause making monthly payments if I was to get deployed, but after I made my decision that it was something I didn’t want to do, they continued to help me look for a car that I wanted. It was simply that if I wasn’t interested, then they’re not going to be pushy about it. Also they were extremely generous for giving me more time to get my check in the mail and deliver it to them. I would most definitely go back to them when the time comes for me to get another car.<//Review>

Working Ed Perry first over email and then how awesome of Peter to reach out and help in place of Ed. He was absolutely very helpful and knowledgeable about the 2017 Pilot. Peter notified me when the right trimline was available. He was very patient with us and really suggested to stay with the EX-L and not move up to the Touring which would be out of our financial affordability. Between Peter and Al, we were able to come to an agreement on a deal for the Pilot that best fitted us. Absolute pleasure working with Roseville Honda. No doubt recommend this dealership. They really worked hard to get us the deal we wanted. Thank You.</text>< Pics>

Thanks to Nisar Ahmed for making the car buying experience fun. Finance completed to paper work to help me buy two cars quickly as the service team detailed the vehicles for delivery.

Outstanding experience and service! I just shook the hand of Seamus who sold us a 2014 Accord Hybrid. Seamus was awesome from beginning to finish! My wife and I are a younger couple and usually get overlooked or receive terrible service at car lots. Salesmen just assume that we have poor credit or don't make much $$ which they could not be more wrong in our case! Seamus treated us great! He answered all of our questions and respected our opinions throughout our experience!! Thanks Seamus! Maybe I will see you on the tee sometime!

Ray Turner was my sales representative at Autonation Honda Roseville for the Costo Auto Program.  Through the Costco auto program,  I received a huge savings on my vehicle purchase.  Ray Turner was an excellent salesperson, he was very knowledgeable,  he ensured all of my desired features were in the vehicle I purchased. He took the time to find exactly what I was looking for and ensured all of my needs were met.  Ray Turner was very helpful and provided great customer service to ensured I was a satisfied customer.  He went above and beyond to provide excellent service- he showed videos of the car while we were waiting, he gave demonstration and explanations of all of the vehicle features.  Even after the purchase of the vehicle, he sent video links for the vehicle for reference,  He also followed up to see how I was enjoying the purchase of my new vehicle.  I would purchase again from Ray Turner and refer family and friends.  He demonstrated excellent customer service and strived for and achieved customer satisfaction.  My husband and I were very pleased with our purchase experience with Ray Turner and AutoNation Honda Roseville.    Thanks Ray Turner !!<//review>

I had a great experience with the whole car buying process. I contacted AutoNation through email requesting a quote which Jason was quick to respond with a fabulous price.  Once at the dealership, Sam helped me from test driving the Honda CR-V all the way through the financing application. All staff were friendly and I would go back there for my next car. The only hiccup is that they were out on the car's manual. Thus, I am still waiting on mine which I believe soon it will be solved.< /Review>

They told me they would have to do a diagnostic to see if they could replace for me.(like 100+dollars).  if it didnt come up bad on diagnostic I would have to pay.  So I scheduled it along with my safety recall and they asked me if I wanted a multipoint inspection along with everything and i said yes..So I get  back after 4 hrs to be expected with a fule pump replacement and Marie says my car came back all good even with the multipoint inspection and I'm woundering .... I told you my passenger side fog light was out and the box checked for "LIGHTS OPPERATION AND CONDITION " was marked good. (How could you forget) Are your really doing the inspection or is it just pensil wiped.. the sad thing is I told you it was inoperable and you still didnt catch it.  If this isn't covered on my warranty considering I have less than 30,000 miles on my vehicle I am shocked. It shouldn't be this hard to get things done that are covered on my 30,000 mile warranty. So that's why you guys get 1 star.< /review>< pics>

This was the best car buying experience. Jake Newman introduced himself and then let us walk around and look at cars with no interuptions. We were able to complete our purchase within two hours. Thank you Jake!<//review>

My first Honda I would bring here to be serviced and always felt like it was a hustle. In 06 tried to buy a civic here, they tried a hustle on me and I walked. I gave them another try this morning, figuring it was 13 years later. Instantly the salesman tried to hustle me on a 2018 after specifically asking to see a 2019 civic 2 door. Car buying shouldn't make you feel like you need a bath afterward. This is systemic, and being the experience is still bad after 13 years? It's obvious there is no interest in improving the quality of that experience.<//text></record>

<text>Without a doubt, the most sincerely rewarding vehicle repair experience I have ever had. My Service Adviser Bobby was professional and an absolute delight to work with. My service was performed within the time frame suggested, with zero hassle or mishaps. The overall facility was welcoming, comfortable and very well maintained. I had a couple great cups of their fancy coffee machine coffee, while thoroughly enjoying watching the Seahawks/Dallas game. I selected AutoNation Honda Roseville to have my Takata Airbag Recall completed, but after this stellar service, I will enjoy and look forward to having any maintenance service or repairs completed by the friendly and competent team at this location.

<Review>Had a good experience buying my new 2018 Honda Fit from Roseville Honda.  The car itself is great.  I nice upgrade from my previous 2007 Honda Fit.  Suspension is smoother.  Black interior is much better than the light grey interior. Not the most powerful engine but that’s to be expected with the great gas mileage.  My sales associate Fadi was very helpful.  Not all of their Inventory is located at the main dealer.  Had to track down the car at one of their overflow lots which took a little time.  It might’ve helped to schedule an appointment in this case which I didn’t do.  Hope I get 350K + miles out of my new Fit as I did with my old Fit.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

We Purchased a 2013 Toyota Highlander Plus from AutoNation Honda. Peter Sobczak did a great Job finding us a car within our Budget and at the time Toyota's  inventory did not have anything close. The transaction was fast and smooth; their finance person was great and worked with us to find the best rate.

Many Thanks

They don't return phone calls (even the service manager doesn't return calls- unacceptable) and they will up-sell you on services you don't need by hundred of dollars.

I took my car here for service and they attempted to up-sell me from the very start. I was shocked and upset. I really felt I was being scammed, especially because it was by hundreds of dollars. I called the service advisor out on it and it was corrected immediately. I feel really bad knowing there are hundreds of other customers here who were unknowingly up-sold on services they didn't need by hundreds of dollars.

Save yourself and go to another Honda dealer or servicer.< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

<Date>1534001631022<//Date><rating>1</rating><text>If I could give negative stars on this place I would. Ever since buying my '07 CR-V from these guys I've had constant problems. Starting with the day I bought my car, the sales and finance department screwed up my contract, and they made me come in 3 separate times to go through all the paperwork and re write it every single time due to what they said was "the new guy not doing the forms correctly". Because of that, every time I come in for service they yank me around, and I have to fight to get them to honor the 2 year bumper to bumper warranty that I made sure to pay for so I could avoid problems like these. They can never find the correct warranty and they always try to charge me for things like oil changes, the window seals that were sun worn from being on the lot when I i bought it, the sun drive that quit working the week after I bought it, tire rotation, the free tire replacement that was included with my contract... the list goes on. They even sold the car to me without telling me there was a FACTORY RECALL on the door locks at the time of sale which low and behold quit working a few months after I bought the car and locked me out of my car multiple times (which when I asked them to check it they told me it was fine, and then when it kept happening they told me about the recall AND tried to get me to pay the $300+ to repair the door lock motor). Today I came to have a routine oil change, tried to charge me $59, I told them no it is included with my warranty, they had to find the correct forms, and agreed to honor it. Then they call saying I need my front brakes replaced and of course, it's not covered for some reason. My dad was in the car sales industry for many years so I double checked with him as I always have to do when I come in here because they constantly try to take advantage of me, being a young girl that isn't car savvy.  They were rude to him on the phone, saying they would only talk to me about it, although I have had to have him fix their mistakes on multiple occasions. So I agreed to just take care of the brakes and they told me it would be ready in a few hours tops. The girl I spoke to on the phone the morning of said they are there until 9. I show up at 7:30 and the rude sales employees at the front desk are quick to tell me they are closed, and no one in the entire building can get my car for me. They asked if I had paid already, I said no, and one of them said he would call the service department manager to come down and unlock the door. A few minutes later the front desk employee picked up a flyer and made sure to point out to me multiple times that they close at 7. He said I should have worked something out and even if they could get my keys they can't accept payments, so I can't get my car today.. Interesting because they sure can accept payment if you're buying a car! But after that they couldn't care less about trying to satisfy the customer. I am not a confrontational person but this drives me nuts. This is the fourth or fifth time I've had problems with these people and if I could give any advice to anyone looking to buy a car I would tell them DO NOT BUY A CAR FROM HERE. STAY AWAY. GO TO ANYONE ELSE. I can't stand these smug arrogant dudes and the customer service here is the worst I have ever seen. I will most likely go to my local mechanic for the rest of my car service needs and pay money to them rather than come back here and deal with this BS.<//text>< Pics>

<rate>5< /rate><Review>I could not have had a better experience with these guys.  Huge shout out to Wesley Stewart for guiding me through the whole process, start to finish, with professionalism and camaraderie.  Everyone I met was exceptionally friendly, welcoming, and the total opposite of pushy.

Wes helped with everything from the paperwork to programming my radio presets, and I really appreciate his laid back demeanor - it put me in a "no pressure" zone that actually made it easier to be serious about the whole car buying experience.

Less than a week in, and I am still loving my new car!  I've recommended Honda AutoNation to half a dozen friends and family already, and my cousin just went in and got a great deal on a new car as well.

Thanks Wes (and the rest of the team)!  I am a very, very satisfied customer! :D<//Review>< Resp>

It was a very good experience.  A little time consuming, but I have yet to experience a car purchasing process that isn't.  What made this memorable is that Michael, the salesperson let us take the car so we can have dinner while they worked on the paperwork.  Smart move, in my opinion...he didn't want hangry customers! We are very happy with our purchase.</text>

Purchased my first brand new car on my own. Happy with my Salesman Darby Meyer and his help. My new car was missing floor mats and a manual due to dealer swap but Darby was able to secure new ones within a week. Everyone at Autonation has been extremely helpful and friendly!< /review>

I can't thank Jake Newman enough for making my car buying experience my best one to date!  From the moment we met him at the dealer, his customer service was exceptional.  He did not pressure us at all and explained every option on our CRV that we test drove and fell in love with and bought!  His hands off approach that he honored when I explained that I was unsure of what I wanted and did not want to be pressured, gave us time to think about our options and honestly, helped seal the deal!  We plan to go back to Jake when we need another vehicle! Thanks Jake!</Text>

Had an appointment at 9:00 am on Tuesday morning and it took almost 3 hours to complete an oil change and tire rotation!!!! I think that this is absolutely ridiculous!!! I can see taking up to an hour and a half and after that, they need to change the way they do things!!!!</Text>

Very slow. Waited 30 minutes just for a service tech to come and check me in. Went in for an oil change and rep tried to just add other services totaling almost a $100. Free doughnuts are always good though.</review>

< Review>
Avoid Autonation Honda for service if you can.  I had an appt for an oil change on 11/20 and when I got there they were obviously overwhelmed and said it would take 3 hours, but if I came back the following day then I wouldn't have to wait so long.  So I came back the next day, with a rescheduled appointment, and clearly they weren't as busy as the previous day.  Guess how long it took: 3 hours and 15 minutes!  Even though they didn't charge me for the oil change,  never again will I risk spending so much time on a job that should take less than 30 minutes (especially with a scheduled appointment).</Review>

If I could give their service department a ZERO, I would. I have never experienced such an incapable staff at a service center. I purchased a Honda Pilot about a year and half ago from Autonation Honda Roseville. Up until a few weeks ago, I hadn't had any negative experiences with them or my vehicle. Then the plastic molding and a plastic clip holding that holds the molding onto the front drivers seat broke. First I had to take the vehicle in so that the 'service' team could verify that it was under warranty - that was on 06/19. They ordered the part and I came back on 06/22 to have the seat repaired. They had my vehicle all day. I came back to pick it up and found that they had only completed part of the repair. The plastic clip that holds the molding together was still broken. So, I waited in for my 'service' representative, to go get two of the repairmen to come out and look at it. They told me it was an issue with the seat cushion not fitting properly when I was standing right there telling them that the clip was broken (and quite easy to see). So, I thought they were quite clear about what needed to be fixed. They again ordered parts. I came back for a third time on 07/05. This time they had to keep my car for two entire days - I was told that two of their repair people were out and that they were over booked. I come back on 07/07 to pick my vehicle and low and behold, it's still not fixed. So again I wait for my 'service' representative to again, gather a couple of the repair people to look at it. They all tell me that they will order the 'correct' part that same day and I can come back today at 9 am and they will make the repair while I wait. It shouldn't take longer than 45 minutes. I show up at 9 am this morning and they have no idea who I am or why I am there. Apparently my 'service' representative failed to actually document the appointment. So once they figure out who I am, I am informed that my 'service' representative is off today and that the parts are not in. Oh, and the Service Manager is on vacation. Did any one bother to call me in advance to cancel the appointment? Of course not. So now I am supposed to bring my vehicle back in tomorrow for the fifth time and be without a vehicle for yet another day. Absolutely Ridiculous! I will NEVER again purchase a vehicle or service a vehicle here.< /review>

My wife and I tried to look at a couple of new cars today and it was a complete joke from beginning to end. Customer parking is down at the Subaru dealership because all the parking spots near the entrance are taken up by new cars. The small parking lot next to the dealership is blocked off for some unknown reason. Hopefully no disabled people try to visit this dealership.

After walking across the parking lot in 95 degree heat. We get into the dealership and someone finally greeted us. I told him what I was looking for and it took 10+ minutes to do a search on the computer, and then tell me they only had one of the two cars I had asked about. I asked to test drive what they did have and it took him an additional 10+ minutes to walk out and then come back and say it's out of gas so it'd be an additional 15+ minutes for him to get gas.

At this point we've been at the dealership for about 25 minutes including the walk across the parking lot, so we decided walk out. We get all the way to our car and the sales person is just now actually trying leave the lot and get gas. He sees us leaving and parks the car behind our car blocking us in. He pleads for us to not go and how we shouldn't care because he's just an employee. After telling him we were done waiting and we were leaving he tried to argue some more. My wife repeatedly asked for him to move the car so we could leave but he kept arguing. Finally after 4-5 times of asking him to move he dumped the clutch and started to peal out as he pulled away from us.

Extraordinarily unprofessional place stay away unless you like being mistreated.< /review>

1st time here and was greeted by James. The guy was Good at customer service abc's to the dot. Quite knowledgeable to What to do. And knows a car guy from first glance.. i just hate it sometimes when people at dealership push for somethin extra. James was not one of them. Came in for a transmission and engjne oilchange. Thats it, he didnt push for after sales of air filters and anything because i told him b4 hand that i do those little things and he respected that. Ill be a returning customer for my other honda. By the way, they have free coffee and donuts that seems to be the talk of evryone.  -Hondaguy< /review>

I brought in my vehicle at 8am for oil change with an APPOINTMENT and later found out they forgot about my vehicle. Sami tried to help me with this but still it’s bad customer service from Honda Roseville. What is the purpose of an appointment if the service techs has to follow their own pattern. Big thumbs down. By the way still waiting for my vehicle at 1215pm.< /Review>

<Review>Good job all around...from our initial call to Jeff, who promised the hard-to-find car within a few days, to our sales experience and candid discussion with Mike, our salesperson, and finally to our financial advisor, Eddie, who threw in an unexpected extra for us. A very positive experience. They did what they said and did it well...which, I believe, is not so common in the auto dealership world.</Review><Rating>5</Rating>< Date>

Purchased a 2006 Honda Odyssey which is amazing. The service department is fantastic. Had an issue with one of the forms, but we were able to contact a sales associate and have the issue resolved the next day.</text>

I'd like to really thank Kristy for her genuine professionalism displayed towards my wife and I. She and I corresponded over a couple months. Kristy thank you for making the shopping process easy and informative. I commend you on your level of attention once we arrived to the dealer. I have to add that my wife and drive two hours to meet kristy. You will totally see us again in 3 years.

I recently bought my very first brand new car here, a 2017 Accord Sport Special Edition.  I was contacted by Jason from Internet Sales after I used the TrueCar app.  He offered an amazing price right off the bat, below invoice, below what I was already willing to pay.  This was a special Honda was running along with 0.9% financing.  Jason was very laid back, not pushy at all.  There are two things I did not like about my experience.  It took way too long to get me into the finance/warranty guy's office.  I waited for over 2 hours after deciding to buy the car before I could sign the papers which only took me 15 minutes.  I didn't drive the car on the highway during the test drive because of bad 5pm traffic.  On my way home I felt a vibration at highway speeds like out of balance wheels/tires.  I took the car to my local tire shop and they tested the wheels which were in balance.  The tires were the problem, they had flat spots from the car being strapped down to a train, truck, then sitting in a lot for a few months.  I contacted the Service Dept about this and it did take a few calls, meetings, etc., but within a few days they agreed to make the situation right by installing brand new tires and wheels while I waited on my lunch break.  A new car should be perfect from the start, but I'm glad to know that if there is some sort of an issue, AutoNation Honda will take care of it.  My biggest tip to anyone reading this is to treat staff professionally and ask questions, state facts, do not make things personal or make demands and get into a power match against anyone.  If you treat people nicely they'll be much more willing to help you.</Review>

I've had a great experience with AutoNation Honda servicing all my vehicles but this time the service advisor, Raj Saren, went above and beyond in solving my problem. Not only did he fix the front seat but he arranged to have a scratch buffed away. His customer service over many experiences there, have been outstanding. When I have trouble with my car, I call Raj.< /text>

<Text>I recently purchased a 2016 Civic and I did all the negotiations online since I already know what I want.  It's a pleasure to work with Peter on their internet sales.  He's knowledgeable and very easy to deal with.  There was slight confusion about the deal when I was about to sign all the paper works and Brad (the manager) fixed the issue to what I believe I should get. They really make their customer a priority.  I highly recommend Honda Roseville to anyone looking for Honda.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

We wanted to look at a few other dealerships, he said no problem, I will see you soon. 10 minutes later, we were back, test drove 1 car, and purchased it. Thank you Matt for making this the most pleasant car purchase EVER! ~The Schmidts<//Review>< pictures>

When I entered the auto service area I was promptly approached by the service attendants and had my seat fixed right away ! That was great ! My concern is that I was initially given the estimate that it will take 2 1/2 hrs, then later told 45 minutes (3 hrs 15 minutes). Total wait time was 4hrs and 45 minutes. If I had been updated,maybe I would not have waited. I was just down the hall ! This is not the first time of poor service.</review>

Honestly, it was a total of about an hour from walking in and driving off (on a Friday evening nonetheless!). Eric was awesome, had everything ready for us prior to our arrival, finance was a breeze, couldn't have ased for a better experience.

Had a regular maintenance appointment scheduled for an oil changed but then decided to have the 15k mile service done since I was approaching the 12k mark. My service advisor was Randy, seriously wonderful advisor. I didn't feel rushed during my stay and felt my concerns were handled professionally. I am new to the Honda Accord family and this was my 2nd trip into this location. I've had nothing but positive experiences with this dealership and I will continue to take my business there. Thank you AutoNationation Honda!!<//Text>

TL;DR: Good inventory, bad salespeople.

It is very clear that this Honda dealership has a well stocked inventory and you will likely be able to test drive exactly what you want. Then it's downhill after that. We rolled up to a bro-y clan of vultures hanging out at the front, and got set up with one of them. We found the individual who worked with us to be incredibly condescending, especially to women. Additionally, he was clearly less knowledgeable than other salespeople we have worked with, awkwardly answereing questions in a very unprofessional manner. Honestly, we were almost completely turned off from going to any Honda dealership after this experience.< /review>

<review>This dealership is ok...Danny in finance is horrible person to deal with.. Just steer clear of him.. trust me..
I eventually bought a car there and they tried their best to haggle with me.(Danny) I eventually bought the car, but the sensors in the back were not turned on like they promised before I left, there was a dent in the car,
and the rim was scratched up(which now I have to go back there to get fixed) They had me sign the wrong contract form, and a few days later call up and had me resign the right one(seems weired, right?) They didn't offer any compensation to correct this either.... Now Im a little worried...
All in all, ok place....Will I buy from there again.... Not sure..

Follow up:
I got my car's dent, sensors, and rim fixed! Which was part of the deal when I purchased my car. Thanks to the great service perople, Amanda, and Nelson. They were incredibly!
But, I called the GM(like they told me too in the response to my email) and let several messages, with no response back! I kind of knew I wouldn't get a call back. They just tell you to do that to make them look better..  So I guess the only people how care to make the customers happy are the service people.. well thank you to them for rectifying this issue.< /review>< GmapID>

<username>Shane Mandl<//username><Date>1522425163220<//Date><Rating>1<//Rating><Review>Vehicle purchased was an 2018 Odyssey Touring
AutoNation Honda was positioned to receive 5 stars - i had tested vehicles and knew what options etc I wanted. I called around a few dealerships to get prices and AutoNation won this (pretty easily i might add). I arranged to come and pick up the car 3 days later.  As i was going to be driving several hours to get there i asked them to have the car ready for me to simply complete paperwork and then leave. To this point dealing with them was a dream...
When we arrived we were told that the car was gone... but don't worry we have one at our storage facility (i think they scrambled and arranged a dealer swap).  We were told 1 hour. An hour later we were told it would be another hour... They didn't have the options in stock and needed to get them from another dealership... This continued... After 5 hours i told them that i was going to leave in 15 mins with or without the car.
I had called twice to specifically ensure that the car would be ready and that the options agreed upon would be installed (i offered to pay a deposit over the phone to guarantee my keeping the deal).
They had the best price, but the service was so appalling that I doubt i'll ever bother with them again $500 in savings was no where near the frustration I experienced.  I appreciate that the car was sold etc, but they do this for a living so they know if it's going to be an hour of 5 - be up front and communicate with some integrity. Also if a customer says communicates that they want a car ready and they are willing to pay up front to have it that way, why not make life more pleasant and have it ready...?
They just emailed me and asked me to give them a review, so here it is.</Review>< Pictures>

<review>I love this place for servicing my Hondas.  All of the service reps, especially Mike V. and James, are there to service the needs of my vehicle and NOT their wallets.  I have often felt like dealerships are out to gouge me (especially the dealership across the street), but not at AutoNation.  I have been able to trust the vehicle diagnosis without worrying about whether I really need a service or not.

The service department always gives an accurate estimate of cost and time.  That's probably why I fee like I am getting a good value for the work they provide.  It also helps me plan my day and make choices like whether to wait for the vehicle or not.

The service department has been incredibly consistent at checking whether or not my vehicle needs any recall updates or not.

I have been going to AutoNation for servicing for over 15 years for various vehicles.  They always do a great job, offer a complimentary car wash, and help my cars to last a very long time.  My '07 Pilot has over 160K miles on it and has no major or minor issue because I have kept up on the regular maintenance using the maintenance minder and the advice of the service advisors.<//review><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

<review>On 2/20/18 I went into Autonation Honda, I had been inquiring about the trade in value for my vehicle.  I was hesitant to trade in my car due to sentimental value. I met Austin King after checking my car into the service department. Austin was a NICE guy he was not pushy, he just asked me some questions to see where I was at when making a change. I test drove one car, we talked numbers on a sale vs. lease. Austin was very knowledgeable in all aspects throughout the process. This was a no hassle environment, I made the choice...I was not pushed into it and as of now I'm LOVING the NEW CAR!!!!!!!!!<//review>< UserId.>

Buying a used car from this dealer was a mistake.

I had initially contacted AutoNation for a car and made an appointment with a sales associate for a test drive. He had also sent me a few more cars that I may be interested in, which was really helpful seeing that my car had just been totaled and I had a limited time to find a replacement. When I showed up, the sales associate I had been speaking with was busy with another customer and I was helped by someone else, which was fine. Then no one could find the car I came to see, or any of the cars on the list for that matter. It may have been sold, or maybe not, nobody knew. What they did know was that the list of additional cars that they sent me wasn't actually ready yet. Not wanting the 45 minute drive to be wasted, I had the associate look up other cars that were actually available so I could test drive something at least.

The associate was able to find the Subaru Forester- It had been on the list  and was actually just released. During the test drive, the brakes squealed a little when stopping and he said they were recently replaced. He says normally that goes away after a while. So I bought the car. I would like to say that my sales associate that worked with me was very good and went out of his way to make sure to show me cars that met my criteria. I do not think he knowingly lied about the brakes.

After driving it for a while, the squealing never went away. I contacted the AutoNation Service Department and brought it back so they could fix it. The service department concluded that there was debris on the pads and cleaned/lubricated the parts for free, which I thought was great! Halfway home the squealing started again, but worse than before. I was told by my normal mechanic it was likely that while the brake pads had been replaced, the rotors probably needed to be turned, which wasn't done (or the new pads were really cheap). Now I will spend money to redo the brakes to have it done correctly if I want the squealing to stop.

At the end of the day, I think the Service Department knew what the right thing to do was, and just opted not to do it.< /review>

<text>Currently with the virus going around and most places closed and taking precautions Autowest Honda appears to be ignoring all the warnings from experts. They do not do social seperation, don't wear masks and gave my wife a look when she came in the service department with a mask on. Also watched the gentleman who was moving cars again no precautions. They were working as if nothing was going on.  So much for customer concerns. I will reevaluate any future business with Honda< /text></record></dataset><record>

Skip this dealership if you don't want to be spammed via phone and email, talked down to, or ignored completely because the moron wants to sell to your husband and doesn't value anything you say. Their prices are not flexible or they're hurting that badly for cash and can't negotiate. Go to another spot, this place is garbage.</text>

My service rep questioned a computer reading and saved me from having unnecessary work performed.  He knew that I would be waiting, so he expedited the maintenance work.  I'm impressed.</Review>

I was so glad to have bought my 2016 Honda accord EX-L from here with Peter Sobczak. He was very friendly and honest. It was a pleasure meeting him having him help us through the whole process. He gave me a few recommendations for picking out a car that I greatly appreciated because I've been to a few dealerships and it wasn't the same, we drove almost 300 miles to Roseville and was glad we did.< /text>

They apparently put locking lug nuts on my new vehicle when I bought it 2 years ago and never gave me a key. I went in yesterday with a flat yesterday since no one else could help me without the key they said. They said they would look at it while I waited with 3 kids. They called me 1.5 hours later and told me I would need a new tire since there was a huge chunk of metal stuck in my sidewall and the tire could not be repaired. They said the tire would be $160 I told them that was crazy I would call back. I called Americas tire they said a new tire would be $50 so I decided to go there obviously. I told the service guy that was too expensive and I would like to go somewhere else. I asked if I could get a key for the locking lug nuts and he said yeah for $175. Um no!! Goodbye! Drove to Americas Tire in Orangevale and they took care of me for FREE!!! Guess what I didn't need a new tire after all just 2 screws in it and they were able to patch. Called management and she refused to handle it, insist I must have misplaced my key....not possible! She even had the nerve to say that well how do you rotate your tires? Check your records I've always serviced my vehicle there so it's never been an issue. See where I just paid $800 for service a couple weeks ago on 2 yr old van!?! I will never service my vehicle here again they are deceitful and have no idea about customer service. Mel Rapton Honda was happy to help me with a new key. I will be going there from now on and referring everyone I know to them and away from Auto Nation Honda!!!!< /review>< Time>

I recently purchased a Honda CRV at AutoNation Honda in Roseville, CA.  We initially received an online quote, which was far below any other store in the Reno and Sacramento areas.  When we arrived at the Honda store in Roseville, CA, the purchasing of our car was the easiest and smoothest process we have ever experienced.  They honored the online quote and we worked through financing and the warranty process quickly and with no hassle.  We definitely recommend AutoNation Honda in Roseville, CA.<//Review>

I came in looking to replace an aging SUV and he got me into a new Accord. Overall the dealer experience was one of the best I've had buying a new car. This was my 4th new car, 18th vehicle overall and everything was very efficient from the paperwork, vehicle preparation, etc. I would recommend both Ed and Autonation Honda because they didn't pressure too much, had a good selection, and knew their products. Also, the financing guys were very friendly and helpful.</Review><time>1540915639737<//time></record>

I have taken my two Hondas over the last 2 Saturdays.  Jonny O'Connell was my service advisor.  He was great, not only was the requested work (regular maintenance) done, but Jonny called to let me know what else is recommended.  I gave my OK and the work was done in short order, and was called when I could pick up my car.  The price on one of the cars was what he had quoted, the 2nd car the service was done at no cost.  I will continue to take my Hondas to Roseville AutoNation Honda for all services< /Review>

Great place to shop a new honda. Sales team is very good . Tim was very helpful. Just watch out when you do yhe paperwork they teally push for the add on warranties ( very expensive even doible then BMW extended warranty).
Notice some scratches on the car when we took the delivery but it was late in night so they promised to grt it fixed and gave me a paperwork for it. And told me someone will contact me to schedule an appointment but nobody did. When i talked to Amanda at customers relation she told me nobody told her anout it. She was very apologetic and took care of the issue in no time. She even got my gas tank filled up.<//Text>

<date>1544578404112< /date><Review>I recently purchased a used vehicle from AJ at AutoNation Honda Roseville over the Black Friday weekend and although the purchasing process was fairly quick and painless, including getting everything squared away for a trade-in, the customer service after the purchase was not quality. Once getting the car home I realized the fan on the heater/ac was not working properly. I brought the car back to the service center the next day and they looked at it, notified they needed a part which would be in later that week. It didn't of course, it didn't come the next day they said or the next and each time I would be the one to initiate a call they never called me to notify whether the part was in or not. After speaking with AJ and letting him know my frustrations i asked if there was anything he could do,  he said he'd speak with his manager and call me back but never did. Luckily the car was fixed thanks to Jonny in the service center, I'm just glad the car works now and hopefully will not have to speak with either AJ or Jonny or their managers in a very, very, very long time....if eve again...< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< name>

<Text>Got immediate attention upon entering the dealer and test drive right away. Had stock of vehicle spec & color of my choices and I was able to drive away the vehicle on the same afternoon. Car was clean and had full tank of gas at delivery, and my sales person Brian, took the time to go through the key details of the vehicle operation. Financial paper process was done like a clockwork. Costco member savings was haggle-free and easy, as well as reasonable amount of discount from MSPR.

Overall, smooth process from picking the car to delivery and satisfactory service.<//Text>< Pics>

I purchased my 2019 Honda Civic hatchback from AutoNation Honda in the Roseville auto mall and worked with Oscar Gonzalez as my salesman. If anyone is looking for a new (or used) car, GO SEE OSCAR! He was extremely patient the entire time we were there which was roughly 5 hours. He was completely honest with me, and he never once pushed me into something he knew I wasn’t thrilled for.

I had a TON of questions to ask him and he answered every question thoroughly even making sure I understood his explanations and rephrasing things when I didn’t- because let’s be honest not every girl understands car lingo let alone sales lingo.

Not only did he make it an amazing experience for me; Oscar, along with Eddy in finance and the sales manager Marco Xiloj helped me get my monthly payments in the price range I was hoping for.

The entire time there, I truly felt like they wanted to help me and make sure I felt at home while searching through cars, test driving, signing all the paperwork, etc. .

Seriously I will recommend these guys to anyone and everyone who’s looking for a car because they made it ALL worth it!

They all went above and beyond my expectations and 5 stars isn’t enough for Oscar, Eddy, or Marco!</review>

While the service seemed to be performed well, waiting 2 1/2 hours for an oil change when you have made an appointment for the service was very disappointing. Not the kind of turnaround time that I was used to at other Honda dealers.
Apparently inadequate staffing and/or service facility?< /text>

<Text>I was looking for Honda CR-V for several weeks, visited other dealers around Sacramento, then decided to email Auto Nation Honda for an e-price and got immediate response from Nancy! Spoke on the phone for couple of minutes, made an appointment and a few hours later drove off with in my new CR-V. Nancy made the whole process easy and painless! Thank you very much, Nancy!</Text>< Gmap_id>

Particularly excellent was Eddy Xlloj, who spent about an hour working on financial arrangements with us. Eddy is of the highest quality in integrity. We are senior citizens, and the technology in cars dated after 2004 does not appeal to us. We are most peculiar that wat. Probably in the less than 5% of car buyers. I would unequivocally recommend anyone seeking to but a vehicle, that Auto Nation in Roseville should be their first stop. Dan< /Text><Resp>None<//Resp>< Date>

<Rate>1<//Rate><review>It's a little annoying to have to pay $135 to have absolutely nothing fixed (diagnostic fee), but that's not my complaint. What's REALLY annoying is that they didn't at least put everything back together, like the plastic cover on the inside of the car is REALLY popping out now (see photo). They didn't even do the minimum that I've gotten from other Honda servicing/dealers like refilling the windshield washer fluid. The technician who worked on my car just checked it off as "ok" even though it was completely empty.</review><pics>None</pics><response>{'time': 1530311265740, 'text': "My-Linh, thank you for taking the time to leave us feedback.

Very happy with my car choice and the customer service is had here at honda autonation. My sales guy was Angelo croft, he was very helpful and patient with me.  This was my first purchase by myself and was unsure of what kind of car I even wanted he was very helpful in asking questions about me to get it down to 2 vehicles. They definitely worked their magic in the back to stay within my monthly price wage. I would definitely recommend this place and the salesman to my friends and family.  Thanks again guys.< /review>

<rating>5<//rating><Text>I had a wonderful experience at AutoNation Honda Roseville. It was my first time and my tech Sam made me feel welcome. He taught me how to check for a few maintenance things on my own, which I appreciated because none of the other Hondas I've been to ever offered that (or maybe they just assumed I wouldn't be interested in learning bc of how I look). I also never felt like I was being upsold random services, which I have encountered in the past. Overall it was a great experience, and I'd recommend this place to anyone!< /Text>< pics>

When we bought our car we had the pleasure of working with a fantastic sales person (that wasn't pushy and seemed to truly want what was best for us). When he didn't know an answer he gave my favorite response (I don't know, but I can find out). So many people would prefer to give wrong information instead of just admitting they don't know everything (Thank you Jake Newman!).  We also had the pleasure of working with a fantastic finance person that didn't try to push anything on us. lastly, even the GM came over to make sure we were being treated right.  Great Experience all the way around!

I just have to share about how great my experience and the service was at AutoNation Honda in Roseville. I came in asking for a miracle after totaling my car in an accident. Having challenged credit and no money for a down payment, sales Reps. Coleman Harriman and Mike Gonzalez still treated me with the upmost respect and dignity despite my circumstances. I truly appreciate the effort the guys put in to pull off the miracle I was asking for and staying within my budget as I needed the monthly payment to be as low as possible as well. After the deal I needed was already made Dominick Daurizio, from financing found additional ways to lower my overall cost while still providing all the warranties and incentives I wanted. With all that being said Coleman, Mike and Dominick were as helpful, honest and professional as they come. I recommend going to these guys if you’re looking for a great deal on a great car. My wife and I are blessed by what you guys do so thanks again fellas. Oh in case you were wondering we got the 2018 Accord Sport w/ all the bells and whistles.< /review>

Great shopping experience.  Best price on a Honda Crv I found in the Sacramento/ Bay Area.  I had Gim as a sales rep, VERY laid back and gave us 0 pressure to buy.  The only pressure to buy came from the finance dept when we went over extended warranties, which we did not buy.  Otherwise highly recommended to buy from!</Text>

<review>Bring your wallet. Purchased my used Honda civic here 4 years ago. After experiencing an unusually rough ride on the way up from Los Angeles I booked an appointment on Christmas eve to use a coupon for a free safety inspection.

I arrived at 8am sharp to a line 8 cars deep waiting to be serviced. The check in attendant was very young and had a casual demeanor but checked me in quickly and was kind.

My service rep met me at the car a few minutes later. I neglected to check his name tag, so instead I will say he was a greying gentleman of sturdy stature with a mustache and light colored eyes. He appeared to be in his mid to late 40s.

I stated I was concerned with my Civic's suspension and he said "Well, let's take it for a ride". We hopped in and he drove us around the automall. He couldn't detect the suspension issue I mentioned - the automall roads are very smooth, so I suggested he try going at a speed of 8mph over a bump - which is the base speed I've noticed an issue. He obliged and still said he found no problem.

We went back to the office and sat down. He said the online coupon I had for a free safety inspection would not apply as a service member would also need to drive the car to test the strut. (There was no text on the coupon that said my type of service was omitted, however it did say it was up to shop discression - he could choose to do whatever he wanted).

The fee for a regular safety check is $160 - I was shocked. The rep said "I'm not going to have my tech check it for free if you're not going to get any work done on the car. I think you're just looking for a needle in a haystack". "I will absolutely get work done on the car if there is anything unsafe! If It is unsafe and I have work done on it, do you credit back the service fee?" He answered, "No.". I thanked him and left immediately.

I will never be back.

TLDR: This is the most absurdly expensive service center I have ever been to with the worst service rep experience I have ever had. DO NOT VISIT.<//review></record></dataset><record>

<text>My pregnant wife who was due in two weeks took our car to the service department when our check engine light came on.  Auto Nation told us the "best case scenerio" would be $4,000 and they could refer us to their car salesmen if we wanted to simply buy a new car with them.  I asked for a printed out estimate and the price estimate dropped to $2,900.  We took it to another repair shop for a second opinion who fixed the issue for $400.  If they would try this with a pregnant women who literraly gave birth 4 days later I dont think anyone is off limits who they think can be had.< /text>< Pictures>

He informed me upfront of what needed to be serviced, keeping repair cost down, and considerate of my time.  My experience was optimal from beginning to end.

This is my third Accord purchased from AutoNation Honda in Roseville. Sales associates are very nice and friendly and make the transactions painless. Jason Christian was extremely helpful on my last Accord purchase.< /Text>

<text>I am so happy that I ventured into AutoNation Honda! Originally, I was looking for a slightly used SUV, but when my son asked Freddie, our wonderful and funny dealer, we were shocked to learn that a brand new 2015 was priced only slightly higher for the EX model that I wanted! I also was delighted to get the burgundy color that I had wanted! I was just thrilled with the wonderful service that Freddie and everyone else provided.  I really appreciated the fact that there was absolutely NO PRESSURE whatsoever, which I had experienced the day before at John L. Sullivan! Everyone was just fantastic, and my son and I actually had a great time buying this new SUV for me! Who ever said that buying a new vehicle can't be fun?! We actually had a great time with wonderful people! And I cannot say enough about Farhid (Freddie)! He was just wonderful, even driving home with me to pick up my car and driving it back to the dealer! They gave me a wonderful price for my old vehicle also.

Altogether, this was a wonderful experience, and I have just LOVED driving my new Honda CRV! I now have the knowledge that I'm driving my two granddaughters in a much safer and gorgeous new vehicle, and that means everything to me! I am a totally 100% happy customer, and I would always recommend Freddie and the wonderful AutoNation staff as a great place to purchase a beautiful new Honda of their choice! Thanks so much to all of you!< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>{'time': 1442870689889, 'text': 'Thank you for your kind words!

<name>Ceasar Pad< /name><Review>My wife purchase a Honda Civic here few years ago and it's time for New Civic and Pilot. I see a lot of good reviews from People who purchase a car, why, are they still offering a free Starbucks coffee after the purchase?
I read the real experiences the problem reviews and how management fixes them. Making sure I don't go through that and I do they will take care of me.
Some of the bad experiences look very bad and keeping me and my wife from walking into this place again.

Not sure if I want those experiences to happen to me. I hope management get this people's problems fix because your losing a customer and base on what I have read the problem starts with the dealers. Yes some of us read feedback from customers.

My experience here once ok with a salesman who was learning and I'm ok with that.

My experience reading feedback from customers about AutoNation Honda is starting very poorly, Specially with bad feedback from few months ago.
I see Bad feedback on google and Yelp.</Review><Response>{'time': 1481730753840, 'text': 'Hi Ceasar, thank you for bringing this matter to our attention.

<Text>My wife and I purchased a Honda Accord from Roseville Honda through the Costco program. Touted as a hassle-free buying experience, and below invoice price, the Honda sales reps who assisted us with our car selection remained faithful to that promise. We've bought several new cars over the years and feel qualified to recommend this dealership which provides a service with utmost professionalism, accuracy of information, and with a vast supply of cars to select from. We were contacted by other Honda dealers near our home but decided to drive 70 miles away to get the best bang for our buck. Simply stated, you can't go wrong buying from Roserville Honda. That is, if you are interested in becoming a member of the Honda family. Good luck with your auto purchase !!!<//Text><GmapID>0x809b1f8cb7689c85:0xfd027cebb953408</GmapID><Pics>None<//Pics></record>

<text>I was very happy with my first Honda Accord, which I drove for more than 14 years, so I found Sam Bunna, who serviced the first Accord, at AutoNation in Roseville and he referred me to Gary P.  Everyone worked with me, was as helpful as possible, and at the end of the day, I drove off the lot in a beautiful 2013 Accord.  It was a great experience and I would recommend the staff at AutoNation Honda Roseville to all. They really do treat you well!<//text><rate>5<//rate>< name>

The staff at Autonation Honda Roseville is outstanding, but I really can't say enough good things about James Harding in the service department. I have an older Acura CL Type S and am very picky about where I have services performed. When it comes to my vehicle, James has earned my trust in a world where not many people do, and I know he will always recommend what's right for my vehicle, along with making sure it gets done right. He is a great service advisor and a great person, and will continue to have my business. When it comes to both the staff and the vehicles, Honda truly is world class.<//Review>

<date>1527274390153<//date><rating>2< /rating><text>We are used to family owned dealership that was great with service and are not a fan of huge dealers that deal in volume and dont care about the individual customer . My husband is now at the service dept for the 3rd time to have a small oil leak repaired . The first time , he also had the timing belt replaced as he needed shocks and thought it would save $ to do the timing belt at the same time.
The car came home from Auto Nation time 1 and my husband discovered the small oil leak.He called and took it in-was told it was residual and sent home, 2nd time and immediately discovered the oil leak AGAIN . My husband was scheduled to go a fishing trip with friends and was to drive but couldn't use our pilot as he didn't want to drive pilot with the oil leak.
He is now after returning from the fishing trip at the dealer for the 3rd time.
My husband is very nice but I am losing patience with the amount of time that is being spent on this matter driving back and forth from sun City Lincoln and waiting,....after we already paid over $2,000 on repairs. He is being kept waiting after taking the car in for the 7:30 apptm, today already 2 hours.
He should have been given better service and definitely there should be better quality control of repairs which has not happened.
I told my husband if we consider buying a car from auto nation will depend on how well and competent the service dept performs. So far, we are not impressed. We are senior citizens and our life is becoming shorter each hour he waits and spends getting the pilot correctly repaired. His valuable time shouldn't be spent making these multiple returns on repairs not being done correctly the 1st time. We miss our old dealer He has now been sent home today without the leak fixed what a waste of time.  they just keep saying they cant find leak and blow him off. If it had been me, I would have insisted that the pilot stay until the cause of the leak is found and fixed. I can see the oil stains in our garage so why cant they find the leak??</text>< Pics>

<review>Very disappointing service here on 7/17. I set up an appointment for 7:30 AM and got there early. It took over 15 minutes to drop off the car.

The service advisor, Bunna, seemed disinterested in actually helping me. I told him I came in get the Summer Inspection that was emailed to me by AutoNation Honda. He said I dont need that and was ready to send me away.

I told him I wanted him to do the inspection and he seemed annoyed that I persisted. He took me back to the office and proceeded to hastily type up a quote and told me it would be 500 dollars without explaining what it was he was quoting me on because just a few minutes earlier, he told me I didnt need anything done.

I asked him to explain what is was he quoted on me and he proceeds to punch a bunch of numbers in to a calculator and threw out another number. Never once did he give me a breakdown of what the cost was.

I got the brake fluid and transmission fluid flushed on the manufacturers recommended schedule. I dropped the car off at 7:15 AM. By 4 PM, no call from the shop stating my car was done. I called in, waited on hold with 9 callers in front of me and then when I did get through, Bunna wasnt available so the receptionist took my number down and said he would call me in just a few minutes.

Fast forward an hour, no call so I went in and picked the car up, just hoping that it would be ready. No one went over the findings from the inspection, explained what was done to my car or anything. Overall, this was one of the worst car experiences ever. At every turn, I had to be in the drivers seat to get things done and feel like I was a burden to the shop.<//review><Rating>1</Rating><response>None<//response></record></dataset><record>

Most of my car-buying experience was great but you will get a ridiculous amount of pressure from finance when they do the paperwork.  I should have known something was up when the first paper they had me sign was an acknowledgement that I knew I didn't have to buy any supplemental packages.  The finance guy then tried *4 times* to sell me extended warranties, add-ons, and service plans.  Each time I declined he'd do a little more paperwork and then present me with another set of packages.  The 4th time he said these last packages were a "no-brainer" so I had to claim a lack of brains to decline it.  I'm sure they make a pretty penny on these packages but I have a very bad taste in my mouth after this experience and wouldn't buy from them again because of it.  If you decide to buy from them I'd propose you tell the salesman that if finance offers you any supplemental packages you're walking out.< /Text>

<review>If you are looking to buy or lease a Honda, RUN don't walk to Autonation and ASK FOR LYNN! Lynn helped us through the process of leasing our new Honda Civic, and we walked away with a lifetime contact. Lynn responded to our online inquiry in SECONDS, set up a test drive for us the next morning and had us out of there in a timely manner. She treated us like family, and we never felt pressured into anything. We will absolutely be returning to Autonation, and I highly suggest you do too!</review>< pics>

<Review>With the addition of another little one to the family, it was time to trade in the sedan and upgrade to a van.  After doing extensive research, the wife and I decided that the Honda Odyssey made the most sense for our growing family.  We elected to choose the EX-L model with navigation in a chrome/charcoal color.

Being a member of the Air Force, the wife and I bank with USAA, who as a part of their "Auto Circle," are affiliated with AutoWest Honda of Roseville.  Both the wife and I were VERY pleased with our point of contact at AutoWest Honda, Kyle Ruoff.  Kyle was very professional, great sense of humor, and truly cared about us being comfortable with the choice we made.  He did not try to sell us anything we did not ask for.  Kyle went so far as to locating our Odyssey at a dealership in Orange County and had it shipped to the Roseville dealership within a couple days.  It just goes to show the type of person Kyle is.  He will go above and beyond to make sure that YOU, the customer, is happy.  If only ALL dealerships had people like Kyle working for them, buying a vehicle would be a very enjoyable experience.  AutoWest Honda of Roseville has my loyalty for any future vehicle purchases and I will be sure to refer ALL of my friends as well.  Thanks a bunch Kyle!  Keep up the fantastic work!</Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

< review>
We tried to buy a Honda Pilot, with cash, from Sam and his boss, Eddie.  After 3 hours of waiting and being continuously mis-informed, we left with no car.  They tried to sell us other cars we originally said we did not want, they would not let us look at a brochure (said they didn't have any),  they would not let us make a down payment on a Pilot being delivered in the near future that was exactly what we wanted,   nor could they affectively check other dealers for their possible stock (said the dealerships were "not answering their phones".    The next day we went to another Honda dealership and we bought the car of our dreams and were out the door in less than 3 hours.  We will never shop at Roseville Honda again due to their poor customer service,  poor management, and lack of integrity.< /review>

<text>My wife and I recently purchased a 2017 Honda Ridgeline and absolutely love it. I was looking for a pickup with comfort and space, as well as good acceleration and power for towing our ATVs. The Ridgeline has it all. Also the rear seats fold up, giving plenty of space for golf clubs. Another bonus is the locking trunk in the bed of the pickup. Also a thank you to Clement in the sales department for doing a great job and being so helpful.<//text>< Date>

I took my Honda CRV into have an oil change.  I'd forgotten that the rear brakes were over due for replacement, something we'd discussed months ago, and the service department brought the wear to my attention.  They also found s nail in one of the front --new -- tires, took it out and patched it.  They both washed and vacuumed out the car.

I drive long distances and I need my car to be reliable.  Auto Nation Honda's Huy takes really great car of my car.  Thank you!<//text>

<date>1533607120545< /date><review>The WORST experience at a car dealership
Called in an hour before visit and confirmed an appointment with Matt. Matt was busy when I got there. Although a lot of agents were free, I had to WAIT AN HOUR until AJ approached me and asked if I needed help. Without a test drive we started negotiating numbers. AJ told me they had the blue car in the storage (color I wanted). After running my credit, he said the blue car has so many accessories so the price jumps by $7k!!!
I have been to other Honda dealerships before and they really do appreciate your business, but these folks don't! They even accuse other dealerships of cheating, while they did not even provide me with a printed copy of their offer!

UPDATE: I called twice to talk to the general manager and he/she was not available. The lady took my number and they have not called yet (after 5 days)! Thanks AutoNation Honda for your customer service!</review>< Response>

We assumed that a big AutoNation dealer would be reputable and honest. OK, we were wrong. We wanted to buy a used BMW and this Honda dealer had the one we wanted advertised. If they had only prepped the car by taking down the street to their BMW dealer the problems would not exist.
The salesman said anything, and rushed the process along to get the car deal closed. One major issue was that there were a few small issues, system warning lights etc, and we were assured by the salesman and the manager that AutoNation cars come with a 4000 mile warrantee that covers virtually everything so all the issues we brought up would be fixed at any AutoNation dealer. Most of these issues could not be fixed by them as they were a Honda dealer and knew nothing about a complicated BMW system. Just some things that came up on the computer panel like tire pressure, fluid levels, brake lining, nav map was not working correctly, etc. all would be "easily fixed under warranty by seeing an AutoNation dealer who can deal with it, like a BMW dealer."
After taking the car, the BMW dealer stated that none of those particular issues that the computer had listed could be fixed for free. Additionally, the 50 point inspection the Honda dealer did, including oil change and brake linings, were not done. Oil was oil and the computer system read out that the linings were low. Nothing was covered under the "4000 mile bumper to bumper warranty" as told us by the salesman Garry and the manager. So we have been repairing the car ourselves. We sent a letter outlining the issues to the AutoNation Roseville Honda General Manager but received no reply.
We can not recommend this dealer.<//text>

Great experience at this dealership purchased  Honda Accord 2017 best price in 300 mile radius. Communicated with sales person through phone and email and had the car ready without even stepping foot into the dealership. If you want the Hustle free buying experience would recommend AutoNation Honda. Vikash Reddy was great to work with give him a call you will not be disappointed.</review>

Usually when I car shop I try to avoid a sales reps because I've gotten the experience that they were just in it for the commission and not wanting to satisfy me as the customer. Last weekend I stopped by autonation Honda and left with a car I wanted.

I was approached by Will. Upon greeting myself and my mother Will immediately began asking specifics of what I was looking for as far as color and features.. during my time there I truly felt Will's best interest was putting me in a car that fit my needs. I am mother of 2 active children so I needed a car with space. I am happy to say that I left the lot with a car of my choice. Usually I will go to different lots and look but with the experience I had from Will I stayed there and left with a car..I highly recommend seeing Will.</Review>< Pics>

I am always insecure when it comes to buying new cars but I didn't felt rushed or pushed to get a car that day. After test driving the car, I asked for some time. I went back to the another company (Nissan) to test a new car since I was deciding to change my Altima. I was treated horribly! They made me want to leave as soon as I could. At that moment, I went back to Autonation Honda Roseville and got the car I wanted. I am glad and happy for the choice I made. I love my new car, and the buying experience was smooth. I would not only recommend the cars, the dealer and it's employees are nice.<//review>< gmapID>

We did not like our salesman at all but we ended up buying the vehicle anyways because we really needed it. Jeff in finances worked really hard to find someone to finance me with my self-employment status and income/credit which I appreciated.

Flash forward a few months and my husband tries to take in the vehicle for our first oil chance since we purchased the maintenance package, and they tell us that with the bank they found to finance us, they took off the maintenance package and NOBODY told us about it. Nothing more frustrating than driving 40 minutes and getting that crappy news.

Oh and the morning after we bought it, the battery was dead so even though we had bought it so I could take my son to school the next day, I couldn't leave. They sent someone out to change the battery and he didn't even have the right tools. I had to dig through my husbands toolbox so he could disconnect it.< /Text>

I made an appointment to drop my car off so that you guys could take it to hyundai  for service since you do not have the parts to fix my car. I got there and was told you  guys would look at it and put in a order. I was there for three hours because you guys told me you thought it was something you could fix which doesn't make sense because it's a hyundai and I know you don't have parts for my car. So after 3 hrs you tell me you can't fix it and I need to take it to hyundai. I never even received a callback from you guys after you  told me you  would let hyundai know what's going on with my c ar and when I could bring it in. Poor customer service< /Text>< Rate>

I have heard so many horror stories from friends who have gone new car shopping that I was hesitant taking my daughter to look for a car. If you are in the market for a great car at a great price with absolutely amazing people, don't look any further than Auto Nation Honda. My 21 year old daughter was able to get a brand new Honda Civic with zero down and small monthly payments. She was a first time buyer with a limited credit history. This dealership went out of their way to make this deal happen for her. From sales personnel to finance, this company works hard for their customers. So thank you Vik, Steve, Greg and Wes for your courtesy and professionalism.< /Review>

<Review>I had the BEST experience at AutoNation Honda Roseville. Huy Tran was my service adviser and was so efficient and helpful! He was constantly keeping me in the loop on what was going on with my car and when it would be ready for pick-up. I had previously taken my Civic to a different local Honda dealership service center and was always left hanging on the status of my vehicle when I took it in. They never called me to let me know what was going on and would have to pull teeth to get any type of information. THANK YOU AUTONATION HONDA! I won't take my car anywhere else for service now. :)<//Review>< pics>

<rating>5<//rating><text>Autonation provided the smoothest and most enjoyable car buying experience we’ve ever had! We used CarGurus to search for the Tacoma that we wanted and found exactly the right match for us at Autonation. The price was competitive, it was a great value to us, and the fact that we didn’t have to waste time negotiating back and forth on a final price was a huge time saver and stress reliever. We want to personally thank our Sales Professional Eric L. and Customer Financial Services Manager Eddy X. for their calm and considerate demeanors, and for listening to our interests and helping us with what we wanted rather than try to push another vehicle on us. They’re great at what they do, and we would recommend anyone to work with them!< /text>< pictures>

First time I've been here. I took a friend car in to get an oil change and it is taking a ridiculous amount of time. I got here at 1:54 pm with no other vehicles on the service drive. A lot porter greeted me swiftly. But the service advisor took his sweet time. It is now 3:54pm and still no car. This is awful, go get your service done somewhere else. Unless you feel like waiting over 2hrs for a 10 min job. I'll do it myself next time.<//Review>

I bought my new 2014 Honda Civic LX from Autonation Honda.  Wes Stewart helped my there.  I emailed him before going to dealer he gave my his lowest price upfront.  NO other dealers were willing to give me the price he did.  I got there about 7:30 pm on a Thursday night I test drove, did paperwork and signed the papers and was back out of there by 10:15 pm.  So Fast.!!! I have bought other cars from other dealers and never have I been done as fast as this.  Wes is great.  Everyone I met there has been awesome.  The follow up after I bought car has been great even making sure I didn't need any help with setting up blue tooth.  I did go to a few other dealers to test drive and didn't have the same level of customer service as I did here. If I was pressed for 1 negative it would be that the women's restroom needs some attention.<//Text>

<text>My sales person Garry Neighbors was Amazing!!! He helped me purchase my CRV with absolutely no stress or hassle!! Along with my fiance guy Dominick D'Aurizio......Both gentlemen were Amazing to deal with. I would recommend seeing Garry and Dominick on your next vehicle purchase. I've already raved to my family/friends and recommend going to Honda Roseville over any other dealer. Before going to Honda Roseville I went into Folsom Lake Honda and was treated so rudely by the sales dept. along with the sales manager I'll NEVER EVER buy a car from them and I'll make sure I tell ALL my family/friends how rude Folsom Honda treats customers.</text>< Resp>

I came in for a software update (recall program) and expected it to take a half hour based on other's experiences with the recall posted on Facebook.  It took 2 hours!  Besides my having bought the vehicle there, there was no record of me in their system.  I was very disappointed and will look for other options for non-recall service.< /Text>

Horrible service. The only reason I am giving them one star is because that is the minimum allowed. First off, I asked the financial manager and sales consultant multiple times that i did not want to run my credit because I had a loan. They insisted they were not going to so I proceeded filling out the application. A few weeks ago I received a notice that my credit was ran. Second, I was going over my paper work on the  car and the financial manager added a 2,000+ warrantee that I did not agree upon. Do not do business with them, they are a bunch of lying deceiving people. Bad business.<//Review>

Im sorry but that is not ok. Its like nobody knows anything over there everyone gives you different answers.and i usually do my service on sundays and i make appt. Some guy bobby said "oh tou don't need appt. We have express lane that is what its for you just come in and out". And this sunday i don't make appt thinking i can just go in express lane they tell me i need appt. Wooooow

<username>elia gutierrez</username><Review>Sam/Sami has been the best service rep I've ever delt with. I've bought many cars and delt with serveral reps in the past and no come close to the great customer service and hard work he provides. He truely cares about his customers and always goes over and beyond for us! He turned a very negative experience into a great one for me and for that i will always be thankful and loyal. I will NEVER do business with anyone other than Sam (Sami) and will forever be greatful to his dedication and hard work he provides his clients on a daily! I cannot remember his last name but he is seated right next to a service rep name James! Honda needs to give this man a raise and his manager really needs to acknowledge his hard work and effort for he hands down is the greatest(give him a reward)PLEASE!!! He gives Roseville Honda a good name! THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONTINUED EFFORT, HARD WORK AND GREATNESS SAM...YOU ARE THE MAN!!🙌🙌🙌🙌❤<//Review></record>

Not honest with customer. Only gave one car key. When asked about a second  car key, two sale men lied and said only one key was available for this model. After talking with manager about there being only one car key, he gave a second one. It would've been an extra $400 for the second key, which was suppose to be given for free.

Very dishonest service!!<//Text>

<user_name>Yolanda Plascencia<//user_name><Review>After spending almost all day at the Roseville automall searching for a new car, we finally purchased a lovely Civic from Honda. Justin our salesperson was knowledgeable and patient with us. He was not too pushy nor did he pressure us into buying. He did not waste our time, and he got us the information we needed. He knew we had been at the automall almost all day and since he heard my husband saying how hungry he was, he even went to get us some Panda Express while we waited for the final documents to be prepared for signing. We were treated fairly and they made our experience a positive one! Thank you!</Review>< time>

<text>Worst dealer I have bought a car from.
I bought a car and got financing then turn out there was an issue so I kept driving  back-and-forth from Napa to ROSEVILLE.
Ended up buying the car cash and they where supposed to get in contact with me about my refund for the warranty I had bought and GAP and have been over 3 weeks and can’t ever get a hold of anyone.
Bianca was a great sales associate and help me a lot.
Will not be recommending or buying cars from this dealer ever again.</text>< Pics>

<review>Drove here without appt as I was due for an oil change and tire rotation. Sure I could do it myself, but the experience here was simple and easy. Friendly staff, reasonable price barely more than the 3rd party lube shops. Nick (service dept manager) offered an Uber ride to work while the car was being worked on. Props to Nelson (service advisor) as well. Nice guy and good communication. Recommended near-future maintenance but absolutely no pressure or upsell.</review><rating>5</rating><UserId.>100942217845590545547<//UserId.><GmapID>0x809b1f8cb7689c85:0xfd027cebb953408< /GmapID><pictures>None</pictures><Time>1524802028158</Time><username>Tim Bardet< /username></record></dataset><record>

I went in there last week and traded in my vehicle for a 2018  Honda Civic. Before we even signed the paperwork we asked if our financing was lined up and guaranteed. Asked them "you're not going to call me in a week and tell me you couldn't secure financing?" They said "Nope, it's all guaranteed we got the go ahead from Honda Financing." They just called us today to tell us they could not secure our loan! I have to take the car back! Not happy! Honda will never get our business again! They lied to us to get us into a car!</Text>

<Review>Well, it is not a pleasant experience. I was in touch with this dealer for a new car via Internet quote thru HONDA website, I went to showroom and the associate is literally forcing me to make a decision on the spot and not listening at all, resembled a low grade trading market. This person is literally in no mood to listen and very unprofessional. I would avoid this showroom and would NOT suggest to friends...<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>{'time': 1460646800787, 'text': "Phanendra, we're disappointed by your lackluster experience at AutoNation Honda Roseville.

Every thing went smoothly, and quickly, just one regret should have financed it Vs leasing it, Wes in fiance has promised to try his best to help fix this, hope that will happen soon.
About Pilot: Love it but wish they had retained some of the features that I had in my 2013 Pilot EX, which are CD Player, Tow Hitch and Back row USB port. Also noticing gear on shifting down are little jerky if you take you foot off pedal, let see if that goes away in few day.</Review><pics>None</pics><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

I went to other dealerships before Auto west Honda and I felt uncomfortable and manipulated.
When I talked to Darcy Phipps at Autowest Honda I was very pleased with her kindness and knowledgeable information.
I felt at ease with the buying process and definitely want to recommend Darcy and the whole Autowest Honda sales staff and managers to anyone wanting a new or used car.

The service and parts staff were so nice and efficient. I really like this place.</text>

We had a complete drama-free car buying experience. Provided, we did the USAA car buying option, but not only did AutoNation have the lowest USAA offer in the Sacramento region, but they beat the USAA price. Both University Honda and Maita were NO WHERE close; they never even bothered to provide a counter offer to the AutoNation price.

Secondly, our sales rep - Mike Lazzara was excellent. Friendly, attentive, and extremely knowledgeable about not just the current model we purchased (2018 Pilot) but options and features of past models.

Buying a car is stressful; maybe more stressful than buying a house. Our experience was stress free, transparent, and we left confident knowing that we were provided a very competitive price!<//Text>

We went to check out a used Miata and rode out with a used Porsche Boxster S.  Ray Turner was our salesman and loved his sense of humor and easy-going attitude.  No pressure and fun experience.  If all the Auto Nation dealerships are this easy to work with I would recommend buying from them.  However, the praise stopped there. The extended warranty I purchased really didn't work for the car, no one would return my phone calls,  left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing, or saying.  We ended up selling the car and purchasing another Porsche from a company that is used to dealing with luxury vehicles and even getting my money back on the unused portion of the extended warranty took some effort.  Great company to buy a car from, but don't look for great customer service when you have a problem.</text>

Please see my previous review from earlier today (9/24/18).  I received a reply to my review asking me to reach out to the General Manager.  I called today, and he is out of town until October 1st!  The reply to reviews are most likely automated.

I reached out to my sales rep, and she also offered to fill up my tank of gas.  This equates to nothing, because I leased a Honda Clarity, and I use electricity only!  I returned to the dealership a final time today and picked up the check for the 4Runner I sold them.  Will not return again!<//Text>

Great people working there. Sale man name Michael Lazzara helped us out 10mins before they close and we bought the car that night. Even gave us a good deal on a new 2017 Honda Accord. Went to 3 different dealership that day and no one was will to help us or budge on there price. Wish I should of gone here first before going anywhere else that day. Bought 3 cars from them with my family and aways treat us good.
Thank you Autonation<//Text>

There are certain events in life that we don’t expect to find pleasant and one of those used to be buying a vehicle.  However, due to an especially great group of people, you don’t have to dread it anymore.  These guys make it about you, not them!   AutoNation Honda made sure our family had a great experience when we recently bought a new Honda Accord.  In particular, Dominick Daurizio, worked with us, and it was a pleasure.  This was no old-fashioned experience.  Dominick had all the papers prepared and we had reviewed them from the comfort of home before the sale.  He gave us all the information we needed to choose a vehicle and asked us how we would like each aspect of the sale to happen.  We got nothing but exactly what we asked for in every way.  There was absolutely no pressure, but a level of customer service that addressed our needs and put a car in our garage.  In fact, he offered to deliver it to our house, since we were busy and it was late in the evening.  We don’t want to forget to mention that we bought this car for more than a fair price and I researched that carefully.  Honestly, there is no reason not to make your next purchase at AutoNation Honda and we highly recommend that you ask for Dominick.  We were also fortunate to have all our financing handled by Gary Pistochini.  He is amazing, as well.  This is our second car from this dealership in the last couple years.  Our first experience was just as pleasant and went just as smoothly.  Give Dominick the opportunity to do what he did for our family, and you will stick with this dealer just like our family has had the pleasure to do.<//Review>

Clement Odu, my outstanding Sales Person, and his Sales Manager, Gary Pistochini, made my experience at Honda of Roseville so simple, easy and transparent, I was amazed! Clement Odu presented me with several choices of vehicles within my price range. Gary Pistochini, whom I met when I entered the building, began working on the vehicles that fit my budget. Of course I found the perfect car which was out of my budget but Clement Odu and Gary Pistochini worked their magic to fit the honda within my budget.Unbelievable! Everything was straightforward and transparent. Everyone was very gracious and made me feel right at home. Thank you Gary Pistochini for your great teamwork with my Sales Person, Clement Odu. If you want a great experience, ask for Gary or Clement, or ask for them both because they are the very BEST!! Thank you !!< /review>

UPDATE 5/10/18: Honda responded to this post stating that the GM wanted to speak to me and to call the number provided. That number by the way, is the main line to the dealership. Not a direct line. I called it on May 7th and the GM was "in a meeting", so I left a voicemail. I still have not heard back. I also found out Mike Esparza no longer works for them. This place just gets better and better.........

The salesman I worked with was Gabe Ricketts. He was great to work with and took the time to answer all of my questions and showed me several different cars. The real trouble came when I went into finance with Michael Esparza. First of all, be prepared to spend about an hour in there. I wasted more time with him haggling over all the extras than I even did for the price of the car. Here's my real issue though, he'll try to sell you the Honda Sentinel Care "Designed to guarantee that you'll save money". Starting price is $1200 and he'll lead you to believe that it covers all maintenance for the first 4 or so years. He finally had to talk to his manager to give me the "employee price" of $750 but that was still too much for the minimal amount of maintenance that a new car requires. So he settled at $390. That seemed like a fair price for all maintenance for the first four years of a car (thinking oil, brake fluid, filters, rotations, etc). And it included a tire warranty. Now when you get the contract in the mail a couple of weeks later, it clearly says it covers oil changes.. and ONLY oil changes. Four years worth of oil changes does not equate to $390 so I requested to cancel. He claimed that the cancellation required a wet signature when the form clearly states you could fax or email the document. So drove all the way there to sign it in person. Coincidentally he was on the phone the whole time I was there and unable to meet with me. So I got a copy of my filled out form and went about my business. The form states it takes 3-4 weeks to process and now it's been over two months and nothing. Mike fails to respond to all of my follow-ups regarding it. I do not recommend this dealership what so ever. There are other places that value your business. This isn't one of them.<//Review>

Worst customer service I've ever experienced.  I paid extra for a maintenance plan. Went to our local dealership and was told my contract had expired. I advised them my contract showed I still had 10k miles before it expired. The stated the number in the computer differed from my contract, however it was out of their hands and Roseville Honda should make it right. I have made numerous calls to the finance department, left numerous messages and still no call. I've advised them it's an hour drive for me to go into the dealership to discuss but still no call.</Text>

First I just want to say that I really, truly appreciate the customer service that I've received at Honda Autonation!!! I was in search for a new Honda Accord for a while now and the search ended the moment I walked into Autonation. It felt really good to feel welcomed and not rushed as my sales rep, Lynn assisted me in answering all the questions that I had regarding the car. She gave me so much detail about the vehicle that it kept a smile on my face the entire time. I didn't just feel like a number, I felt like a customer should have felt, welcomed. Dom, the sales rep who handled my paper work was informative and efficient in his approach in explaining all the neccesities. He also found the best rate for the vehicle. I'm just so happy about this car and the service I received. Thanks Honda at Roseville!!!<//review>

HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE!!! LES the GM won't return calls or help me out. The DMV clerk is an absolute idiot who made a huge mistake and now I'm suffering. Bought a brand new vehicle from then for a good price, and paid for it to be delivered out of state as I'm from Oregon and didnt want to pay the sales tax. I was assured by the sales team all docs would be sent to Oregon DMV and in a week or 2 I'd be able to register and title in Oregon. Over a month later I find out the dealership sent the paperwork for a California title. Now it will be 6 to 8 weeks until Oregon receives this and another 6 to 8 weeks for Oregon to process it. I'm not alibi le for a temp in Oregon so I'm forced to drive without registration or a temp for the next 4 months. They made there money off me and now went return a call or get me a temp until there mistake is figured out. Very rude< /text>

I didn't feel crowded approaching the lot upon my arrival compared to some other dealerships where a cloud of salesmen are stationed at the entrance at the lot. (I had visited a dealership before Honda, and there was a salesman that was popping his head in my window asking me if I needed help even before I had the chance to turn off my ignition. This is a great tactic to turn off any customer.)  As my boyfriend and I parked my car and set out on the lot, a salesman by the name of Peter Sobczak asked if we'd been helped. We told him what we were looking for, and  from the time we first engaged with him to the time of completing the transaction I'd not once felt pressure. I know a lot of these salesman has to have great patience, but Peter seemed genuine and patient in his customer service and was really working with us on making my new car financially practical for my monthly budget. Thank you Peter for taking care of us and shoutout to his team members that helped us close out the deal and process the paperwork even after you guys were closed.

<Review>Having bought three cars in 6 weeks time.. I got to know the staff at Roseville Honda pretty well. Samuel, Erick Luna & Jeff Kissar were excellent sales folks. Talk about going over all the options and showing me anything I wanted to see - absolutely amazing. We had some tricky issues come up - Sales Manager Brad Triplett was not only friendly and fun but went above and beyond to take care of us. John in finance was outstanding as well - we drive about 25k per year - helping us find the right extended warranty and maintenance plans that would work best for us. Amber in Service was also kind, patient and and wonderful advocate for helping us handle some unusual issues. Can't wait for the next time I bring another friend to buy a car! Thanks Everyone.<//Review>< response>

Awful place to purchase a car. These people (Salesman Mike Lazzara and his Finance Manager) lie about your credit score and APR percentage so they can sell you their extended warranties. Randi Kushen never returns calls and their Sales Manager told me that they paint 85% of their used car. Be aware of this before you go there. Hopefully their Service Department is not as bad as Sales.</text>

< review>
Took off a star because salesmen peter was rude there but should've put 5 because of the fabulous manager and Eric.

Peter sucks, he was rude and unfortunately made commission off the car I bought since he was the one I originally spoke to on the phone also because he did not explain to me that this location does not haggle on used car prices before I drove an hour away to go check it out.

Find Eric Luna, he's the best:
Reasons why lol.

Eric Luna was fabulous, go to him yall, made the experience comfortable, wasnt pushy, and was able to answer all my questions about the car and was able to do great communication with the manager.< /review>

I had my 18 year old daughter take the vehicle in for a regular oil change and the service dept took advantage of the fact that she is a young inexperienced women when it comes to dealing with automotive service departments. They added unnecessary services and overcharged her. Shame on them.< /Text>

This was my first car purchase and I don't believe I could have had a better experience! My sales rep, Peter, and his manager, Eddy went above and beyond to make sure I got exactly what I wanted on my new 2017 CRV without any pressure to purchase. Even after my purchase, Peter assisted me with getting the add-ons I wanted and even called around a couple of dealerships in order for me to get them asap.

I would happily come back again for another purchase and definitely recommend this Autonation team! Thank you Peter and Eddy!</Text>

<text>Purchase went exceptionally smooth.  I purchased a 2013 Civic EX-L after extensive research of not only this car but similarly equiped vehicles from Nissan, Toyota, Hyundai and Kia.  Garry Neighbors quoted a price that was far below competitive dealers in the area.  The price was honored during the purchase.  Finance was smooth and staff was very pleasant to work with.  Everyone at AutoNation respected the time and research that I put into this vehicle purchase.  I was introduced to several of the service staff and given a tour of the building.  I felt respected and given proper consideration during the paperwork phase.  Total time: 90 minutes to inspect the vehicle, complete the purchase, go over the main points of the owners manual, demo several of the interior features, and drive off the lot.  Whatever issues AutoNation has had in the past were not experienced by me at all during this visit.</text><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

Great Experience! Vik and Peter took care of us. We were there knowing we'd have to leave with a car that day...it was between the Odessey and Pilot; once my husband test drove the Pilot Touring he knew right away we had to have that one! Peter heard our story and was trying to accommodate us as much as possible. We didn't get handed off to the Sales Manager (in which a lot of the dealerships did to us) Peter stayed with us until the very end; even stayed a little longer to help us get equipped with our car. Made sure we knew all the hidden gadgets/goodies the Pilot had to offer. If you are teetering between the two...go see Peter at Roseville Honda; he'll help you decide (the car spoke for itself, Peter was just there to help make the transaction a little smoother).<//Review>

<Review>We bought a 2016 Pilot AWD EX-L from Autonation Honda Roseville. Our internet sales manager is Ray Turner. Because we live in the bay area, he's very punctual in returning emails and communications was very good and punctual. In addition, I was able to trade-in my old highlander for a good value. So overall this is the best car purchase. I also want to recommend Alex, the Finance manager helping us with all the paperwork. Alex is very diligent in sharing all the important additions for the car. He doesn't push us into buying any of it. He's patient and thorough with everything. One thing to note is that this is the fastest signing process. We stayed in the dealership for a total of 2.5 hours which is pretty short compare to our experience at Hayward Honda. Both Ray and Alex are courteous & we like our car buying experience. When its time for my wife to replace her Odyssey, we will definitely come back to this dealership.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

Took my vehicle their twice; I don't trust their staff.  I received diametrically opposite information from them on two separate occasions.  I've wasted too many hours in this poorly run shop.  I now drive an extra 15 miles to have my Pilot 4WD serviced  by the Folsom or Maita Honda.  I'll never take my care back their again.< /review>

<Review>Poor place to do business. We went and met a nice sales man there who showed us a truck we had seen advertised online. We test drove the truck and got back from the test drive and another gentleman came over and started looking at the same truck our salesman came to us and informed us that we needed to make a decision immediately as the other gentleman wanted the truck as well. We said we would take it and went inside but noticed the other guy inside too. We were then told the first person to do the paperwork first got the truck even though we were paying cash, we proceeded to do paperwork fast and waited. After a short time our upset sales man came to us to say we did not get the truck as the other sales man had out and out lied and said he had been working on paper work for a bit and had been with his customer for hours. There was no one looking at the truck when we got there and we had the keys the whole time even after we were told we didn't get it, also the man never drove the truck so I guess the salesman that lies the best there wins not the customer who has been there working with the salesman no first come first serve here. Very poor management to let this happen. The only thing I have good to say was our salesman was very nice and apologetic but wouldn't go back here</Review>< Name>

<Time>1535814018550</Time><rate>4< /rate><review>Update:

I had another issue with my Honda Clarity and although I had a less than pleasing experience during my first visit to AutnationHonda-Roseville, my experience this last time was a significantly different . . . A virtual 180°!

I was having trouble with the Infotainment system, and by trouble I mean it was the vehicle equivalent to Donald Trump, it just wasn’t working for me.

Luckily for me my service advisor was JOHN DAVIS.  He was the absolute polar opposite to the service advisor who “assisted” me the last time I reviewed this dealership.

John took ownership of the problem, he made every effort to accomate me, he kept me informed of the progress during the entire repair process.  In short, he was the commensurate professional.

While I did have a disappointment experience during my last service visit at Autonation, John more than made up for that lackluster visit.

In short, if you need service on your Honda, see John Davis.  I have no doubt he will make it right for you.

Previous Visit:

My tale of woe began on Sunday, March 26, 2018, when the warning light on my dash indicated the car was experiencing a problem.  I looked up the issue on the all-knowing internet and found that the issue could only be rectified by the dealer.  So, I went on the dealer website and booked an appointment for Thursday, March 29, 2018.

Prior to the appointment I received a confirming telephone call from the dealership.  I stated I would be there as scheduled.  I also asked how long the service would take to complete.  The person calling did not know that information, but she stated she would have the service advisor call me.  No one called.

Upon arrival at the dealership I was told they could not service my car that date because the ONE person who is qualified to work on my car, a Clarity, was off that day.  I then inquired as to why the appointment was made on that date given the non-presence of the service tech.  The service advisor asked me if I made the appointment on-line.  I told him that was the case.  He then tried to blame me for setting up the appointment in that manner and wanted me to reschedule.

As I had taken off work for the morning and drove 35 miles to get to the dealership, I was not inclined to go away without having the work completed.

The service advisor was not only rude and unresponsive, he was also unwilling to help in any way (I later found out he was certified to work on my car).

I then spoke to Gary Pistochini, General Sales Manager, who assisted in getting the work done.  Bear in mind the only "work" that needed to be done was to add fuel cell coolant to the vehicle . . . not exactly an engine rebuild.

Bottom line is the arguing and dealing with the unacceptable attitude of the service advisor took three times longer than tending to the actual issue.

My thanks to Gary Pistochini and John Gullo.  But for their intervention and assistance I would have left the dealership with the problem unresolved and I would have wasted the morning.

However, in spite of the "happy ending," based on the circuitous route it took to get a simple issue resolved, I regret to state that if I had a viable option, I would have my fuel cell vehicle serviced elsewhere.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

Worst Car seeking experience in my life. I was lied to in order to bring me in and had my credit checked without my permission on a vehicle i had not even seen or had interest in. When i asked for them to take the 5 hard credit inquiries off my account I was ignored. Management failed to assist me.  I wrote a complaint to the Better Business Bureau and found out they have multiple unresolved complaints, including my own. I will never buy a car from them as they destroyed my credit (30 points deducted per hard credit inquiry). Please seek other options before buying from them. I actually had a wonderful experience at Future Nissan in Roseville.< /text>

<time>1523459072155< /time><rating>5</rating><Review>I’ve been with Honda since 2013-2014. Back in 2013 my first time buying a car was a horrific experience...nothing about it was enjoyable, my salesman was just extremely money hungry and wanted the sell. However shortly after getting that car I was in a terrible accident, my car was totaled, I felt so extremely safe in my Honda Civic I knew I wanted another one! That’s when I went back and I had Jordon Olsen who helped me into a 2015 Honda Civic, everything was so easy, no pressure, happy, I even cried that time because I felt that’s how it should always be. Buying a car is an amazing feeling. Jordon made sure my maintenances were taken care of and everything. Fast forward now to 2018, jordon no longer works there and I was devastated...I didn’t know who I would turn too... I asked jordon and he pointed me to Mike L. Oh wow, I was so incredibly pleased...see I’m a new mom to a 4 month old, life can get hard and I can have long days, being at a dealership isn’t ideal for all day...anyway, Mike started texting me, answering all of my questions, in fact we texted for a little over 2 months, he didn’t pressure me, he wanted to make sure my needs were met, and I was happily taken care of. After the 2 months of us texting, we found my exact car which is now a CR-V (mommy approved) lol, and when I went into the dealership I was there maybe all of a few hours. Mike had everything done for me, I just had a few signatures, and to go into finance, then I was off in my brand new car. I have never been so pleased, besides working with Jordon also....I love Honda, and the family it is...because of Jordon referring Mike L...I wish I had a need for multiple cars so I could keep buying from mike, and since Saturday April 7th I have referred two people to Mike because how awesome he was.< /Review>< Pics>

We just bought a 2016 Honda CR-V over the weekend and could not be any happier. An overall great experience. Mike Lazzara made it happen. Great customer service, never felt any pressure, and he got us exactly what we wanted. I would definitely recommend him if you want to leave with the car you want. I went to Elk Grove Honda the night before and didn't feel comfortable with the offers presented. I pretty much felt like I was getting robbed at Elk Grove and I am glad I did not buy a car from them. Roseville Honda Autonation is the place to go.< /Text>

<Review>I just bought my new 2016 Honda Civic EX from Autonation Honda and am very happy with it and was surprised at the great customer service I received.  I had been researching new cars, but was waiting on my tax refund before buying.  I had just made a visit to a Hyundai dealership, and the salesperson was very nice and helpful, but when it came to talking with the sales manager, he was the cliche pushy, sleazy salesperson we all want to avoid.  I kept telling him I didn't want to buy right now and wanted to think on it, and he made me an unbelievable deal, but I didn't feel comfortable doing business with him.

I didn't get that pushy or sleazy vibe at Autonation Honda.  I had been there a couple weeks earlier talking to Jordon, who was helpful in showing me the different car models I was looking at, but didn't push me on making a sale.  When I went on the day I bought the car, Peter helped show me the features on the car that would be best for me, and showed me the numbers and I said I would have to think about it, but he wasn't pushy either.  He was very personable.  I wouldn't have considered a lease, but Sonny the sales manager spent a great deal of time explaining leasing vs. buying and wanted to make sure I was comfortable with everything, and he was also very personable.  I still said I would have to think about it, but he didn't push me either.  They were also willing to hold my check until I received my tax refund, so I wouldn't have to wait to drive home the only blue Honda Civic EX left on the lot.

I went home and did some research on true car to see the best price I could get, and after feeling so comfortable with all the people who helped me, especially after talking to Sonny, I called him shortly after coming home and gave him the true car price, and he lowered the price of the car.  I came back and signed the leasing agreement with John from finance, and he was also honest and straightforward with me about the options.

Bottom line, I felt everyone here was honest and helpful and made me comfortable with buying a new car.  I went in with the idea that all car salesmen are pushy and sleazy, but I didn't get that vibe from Autonation Honda.  I would buy another car from here.< /Review>< resp>

-----WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER-----

I can give like ZERO rating for this Honda dealer. They have promised a quote for me over phone and email and after I'm done with the paperwork (ran my credit check and all) and everything they raised the 3000$ more on the price of the vehicle and said they cannot give for the quoted price. They stated it was a coordination mistake between them and they really didn't care for me. The manager was very rude and unprofessional. I don't have a car and I took a CAB after work to that location which costed me 60$.....Finally it's a WASTE of time and money.< /text>

<review>The people at AutoNation were friendly except one person who seemed to want to pressure us. We were given a high interest rate by him. I guess he was the loan manager.  We walked out.  They came back with a better deal in a few days.  However, I found myself signing up to too many warranties - which I did not need. Fortunately after a lot of back and forth negotiating and making a couple visits, they agreed to cancel the warranties totalling close to 4K for the Honda Civic which included extended warranty, Tire, theft prevention and paint/interior.  One of the managers representing the General Manager (GM) was very helpful. The finance manager Eddie was helpful. The salesperson Vikash Reddy who was continuously communicating with me was  forthright and very helpful. He went out of the way to provide every help I needed. I also was given the right color choices of car and was helped to connect my cell phone to the car via blue-tooth. The manager representing GM (his name ends with sky) was very determined to make sure the customer service was very good at the end of the day, because of who I was able to cancel an unwanted warranty. I especially felt Vikash did a great job of explaining different options professionally and truthfully.</review><pics>None</pics><response>None<//response><Gmap_id>0x809b1f8cb7689c85:0xfd027cebb953408<//Gmap_id></record>

I decided to look into buying a new Pilot way earlier than I had planned. I submitted an online financial request and got a response from IkaIka Hoohuli. He worked with me over the phone, going over my options, and I agreed to come in and see what they could do. It was a long night and there was a ton of back-and-forth. But in the end, they got me a deal that fit within my budget AND completely covered my car, interior, exterior, you name it, I'm covered! Thanks guys! Y'all were great. :)</review>

<Review>I recently purchased a Certified Pre-owned Honda Civic. My experience was not great (1- 2 stars). During the car purchase, I felt rushed and did not get to check out the car in depth as other salesmen wanted to show that same car. From the time that I decided to buy the car until I went into financing took 2 hours. Before I went into financing I had asked the car to be cleaned and vacuumed since you could see dog hair all over the seats. When I finally had purchased the car, they did nothing to clean it properly, and there were still hairs. I ended up having to go home and clean the car myself. Additionally, they wanted to sell the car to me with only 1/8 tank of gas. I had to fight with them to fill the car a half a tank since I didn't even negotiate on the price of the car. When I got home and looked at the car the next day, there was a chip in the center of the front windshield,which they never mentioned and I never saw due to it being late at night when I finally got the keys to the car. I ended up calling Autonation Honda 5 times only to be directed to voicemail. Finally I got in contact with Sale Manager Eddie, who said he would fix my windshield. He brightened my experience, which would have been 2 stars up to 3 stars. Without him, I would have said not to buy CPO from there again, as you get horrible service.</Review><resp>None<//resp><pics>None< /pics>< gmapID>

<Text>Recently I went to Auto Nation Honda in Roseville to buy my first car.
The moment I entered into the Honda Lot, I was greeted immediately by one of the
associates, Ed Steuart. I gave him a general idea what i was looking for, which was a honda civic coup and he assisted me and showed me the different models and colors they had. I had a very very tight budget and thought what i wanted would be impossible to get. After negotiating with the manager, Ed helped me get an even better deal then i expected. I have went into many other dealerships looking for this certain car and no where was able to beat the deal i got at AutoNation Honda and no where was able to give me the great, all around experience i received here.
AutoNation Honda in Roseville, is 100% the only dealership i will ever refer any friends and family to purchase there car at.<//Text>< Pictures>

Ever since we got the tires rotated on our Odyssey, they all shake violently when we're on the freeway. It was smooth, but now it's not.< /text>

Called AutoNation Honda service rep regarding my tires to see if there is a warranty on them. She was going to double check and call back. So she called back and told me $150 off per tire. Next day I called back to double check before I go in and she confirmed that I would not have to pay anything due to my warranty. 3 hours later of running back and forth at there dealer ship, she told me she gave me wrong info and they won't cover any cost.. I was upset, as anyone else would be, and asked to speak to her manager. NICK GILLILAND came out looking annoyed as I am sure he knew about the situation..First off, he did not care one second about all the time they wasted and everything I said he threw to the side and said, "look there is no way I am going to put 4 new tires on your car" then told me that the lady helping me has been there for only 3 weeks, which totally makes It okay for her to give clients false and incorrect information, right? So I told him look just because she is new, she can't be giving false info and wasting hours of my time. He just shrugged and said "can't help you, I can do free alignment if U want"
Just the fact that he treated me so unkindly and unfairly, I can already tell you, that my next lease WIll not be with Honda!< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

I just purchased my 2013 Civic with the help of Vince Nason this last week. It was truly an enjoyable experience! I found Vince through internet sales which is definitely the way to go. I trusted him and never felt he was trying to sell me something I didn't need. How refreshing it was to feel that the sales person with whom you are working actually cared about selling you a car that was right for you, and giving you the best price! I will definitely be recommending Honda Autowest to all my friends. Thanks Vince!< /Text>

<Review>I had a fantastic experience at the Roseville AutoNation in purchasing my 2009 Honda Accord.  I had the privilege of working with the salesman Nisar Koshan who was very pleasant and helpful throughout the whole car-buying experience.  The managers and financial advisors there were also friendly and knowledgeable.  I would definitely recommend buying your car from the Roseville AutoNation, their customer service is above average.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>{'time': 1432749577377, 'text': 'We are happy you found us so helpful!

Wonderful experience! Ross, my service rep, was quick and spot on when checking in seeing as I was alittle rushed to head back to work. When picking up my car, Ross went over everything that was marked down the inspection sheet and walked me to the cashier's. all in all, I'm sarisfied with Roseville Hondas service deparment! Definitely will be going back to Ross for my next service.< /text>

<review>I went to autowest thinking of getting the best price with my budget. They had given good email service sometime back(specially by GM Ron), so I went ahead personally but I ended up buying the model which was not what I had in mind, meaning not the right color, not the right price. I felt I was being shouted at and was pushed to buy the car. I was really confused and on verge of crying, but they didn't allow me to go (it was 11.15/11.30 at night). They managed to get me signed the documents, without possession of the car and insurance papers.

I know I am an adult and noone should be able to force, but still they were really good at it and I am not happy about it.I am so much disappointed with this experience that am ready to buy Toyota (if they cancel the deal)

I would like to add now, that they proved my point of them being pushy correct. I was going to be out for couple of days and they had been told about it, but still they tried to deliver the car, but luckily for me my apartment manager didn't take the car keys.<//review>< user>

<text>We had an unusual situation: While we on vacation, 1,000 miles from home, our 2007 Honda Element developed a problem. The Element was completely packed with stuff, including food and wine. It was about 110 degrees outside. Instead of getting it fixed or trying to make it home with a broken vehicle, we decided to buy a new car -- we had already been looking into replace the Element, so we figured this was the opportunity to do so.

We like Hondas, so we went to the AutoNation Honda in Roseville, CA. As we already knew what we wanted, we picked out the car rather quickly, in less than 10 minutes. We didn't need a test drive. We had the money, so we were prepared to write a check for the vehicle ("pay cash").

It took *four* hours to buy the car. FOUR! Why? Well, part of it was because they insisted on doing a credit check on me and my wife, "for identification purposes." (At least they did not use the Patriot Act excuse on us.)

This bordered on intentional fraud. Why? Because, as we've come to find out, there is no statute or law that requires them to perform a credit check on us – we had notified them, up front, that we were paying by check (all they needed to do was verify the funds). They never told us that the credit check was entirely optional – they repeatedly pressed us to fill out the forms as a requirement to purchase the vehicle.

It is a common tactic, used by some dealerships, to try to get a customer to finance a vehicle. In many cases, when you finance, the dealership gets a percentage of the interest -- making them more money.

What makes this even worse is that running unnecessary credit checks can actually harm a person’s credit score.

No means NO! Their finance manager insisted on reading, in excruciating detail, all of the "options" we could purchase. I kept saying no, and he kept talking -- wouldn't stop -- even to the point where he would talk over me. At that point, all we wanted to do is write the check, transfer our stuff from the Element into the new car, and leave.

Let’s break this down:
The salesman: He was OK. He did his best in a bad situation. We weren’t happy, we were tired, we were hot and my wife was suffering from the symptoms of low blood sugar. However, he was a participant in the, “we need to run a credit check on you for identification purposes,” scam. He should know better.

The finance manger: Learn how to treat customers with respect; again, no means NO. If he was the one that caused the sales experience to take four hours because he was the one insisting that a credit check be done, then perhaps he needs to be fired. What an awful representative of the dealership.

The DMV person: This is why they got 2 stars instead of 1. She was entirely helpful, communicative and efficient. She helped us get our car titled in our home state within two weeks after we got home. To her, I give a huge THANK YOU.</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

<Text>We picked up a brand new Civic from Autonation Honda Roseville.  Its the 6th time our family has made a ourchase from them, and we will continue to go back when the need arrives.  We thought going in we would have to stick with a late model, high mileage used car, but Ray and the folks over there worked hard to get us a fantastic deal on a brand new one.  We are very happy with out experience, and will be letting all our friends and family know when they are in the market for a car.</Text>< pictures>

AWFUL financial experience!! Traded my old car and they NEVER called my old loan to get the EXACT payoff amount. Long dramatic experience shortened..I ended up late on my old car payment due to the failure of HONDA NOT COMMUNICATING with the loan. I called the financial department 4 times leaving messages. No returned call. I called during the day again, and the receptionist said they were busy...really??? The supervisor of financial doesn't listen to his gmail first thing walking in??...must be "busy" first thing in the mornings midweek on a Tues-Wed for the past 3 weeks..but hey drive up to the dealership saying you are looking to buy ..they flock and help you instantly! The most important and stressful part of buying a car is the financial part of it....THANKS HONDA for ruining it for good...I'll be sure my husband buys his Type R ELSEWHERE!<//Review>

I will be sending everyone I know to autonation.
Quick to respond to my questions. The internet sales team was great Vikash Reddy and Gary Neighbors were not pushy while being very helpful. Nicholas in financing was great with showing the protection options. I can't say enough good things about my overall experience.</review>< pics>

The car runs good, but we had to pay a $250 dollar surcharge for an out of state delivery, ok that was fine.
But after two hours of driving to Reno Nevada, the Notary the dealership uses was gone and would not answer their phone. The lot guy who drove the car we were going to buy called the dealership, he was told we would have to go back and try again tomorrow, two hours each way.
Well! I was ready to cancel the sale, having not taken delivery yet it would have been easy to do, there are plenty of cars out there.
But my daughter who was with us googled 1,2,3 notary, after 6 or 7 calls she found a guy having drinks 10 miles away in a bar, but he had his stamp with him, so we completed the sale.
I gave the guy an extra twenty for helping us out.
But I can't help but feel the dealership should have payed my daughter the $250 because she saved them a sale, I'm stubborn and would have easily  walked out and left the one lot person stuck with two cars in Reno.
But this was no fault of the car, it runs good.    JC< /Text>

<review>Typical car salesmen.  I went in to ask if they had a certain car, and they told me that they didn't, but they might be getting some in an hour and a half and told me I should wait to see if any come in.  They also told me I should fill out all of the paperwork now, so that way when they got the car I wanted, I could grab it and leave.  I just wanted to ask a question and they were so pushy, it's ridiculous.  GO TO AUBURN HONDA!  They're 100 times better!<//review>< Date>

My girlfriend and I were interested in a 2014 Honda Accord EX-L V6. We had done our research for about 6 months and started shopping around at different dealerships. We talked to Reno, Carson City, and Las Vegas dealerships. The lowest quote we got from those dealerships was not what we were looking for. We decided that we would be willing to go to California if the price was right so we decided to put in for a quote through AutoNation Honda.

The very next day we were contacted by Darby Meyer with a quote for $25,975 (almost $3,000 under invoice). Darby was extremely helpful and accommodating. He answered all of our questions over the next couple weeks and never jumped prices around or tried to change what we wanted. After we shopped around a little more to see if we could get a lower price we decided to make the drive to Roseville.

Once we arrived we were immediately greeted by cheerful staff who got Darby right away. We already had the car picked out through their internet service. We were test driving the car within five minutes. After the test drive we decided we would purchase. Everything was very straight forward with very little confusing salesman mumbo-jumbo. Darby did everything he could to make our experience as quick and painless as possible. It was a very busy day so it took about four hours for us to get out with the keys. However, the four hours wasn't spent with us being bombarded by "packages and extras." Darby was not pushy at all and got our paperwork signed and had us sitting with the finance manager as soon as possible. After about 10 minutes with the finance manager we had the final contract signed and keys in our hand. Darby then went so far as to help us figure out some of the technology in the vehicle (However, we already knew most everything due to our extensive research on the vehicle). We were driving off the lot with smiles on our faces in no time at all.

I would highly recommend AutoNation Honda Roseville to anyone looking for a new Honda. AutoNation is a high volume dealership so they really can get you an extremely low price on the exact vehicle you want. Also, ask for Darby Meyer. He was very helpful and not a pushy salesman type. All in all and A+ experience. Thank you Darby and thank you AutoNation Honda Roseville!

Advice for buying a car: Do NOT be in a hurry to purchase a vehicle. Do your research for months before you plan to buy. After you find the exact car you want, start to hunt for the price you want. Try not to test drive until you are ready to buy and have found a deal you want. Cars are just mechanical objects. There are 1,000s of them just like the one you want all over the country. Do not fall in love until you sign the contract and the car is yours. Be open to traveling for a good deal.< /Text>

< Review>
I had my heart set on the sonic grey honda civic hatchback. (But had never seen this color in person yet) After calling around the area for quite some time to see if anyone had this color, Ed from Roseville honda said it was just coming off the truck so I rushed over. I just wanted to see the color so that when I was ready to sell my car and buy a new one, itleast I knew I liked the color and could order it. Well thanks to Ed and Jake, I bought it. It had everything I wanted from black cloth interior to black rims and the sport edition. Ed initially started helping us but had an appointment so he set us up with Jake. Keep in mind I got there fast with no appointment. Jake was awesome too. Never pressured me nor lied to us like another past expiernce we had at the Folsom Honda. They offered us a very fair trade in price for my car and a payment I was comfortable with. Process was long but worth it. Jake and my husband chatted for quite some time and they seemed to hit it off. We joked about how messy my trade in was, becuase I was embarrassed and he said its no big deal, your going to let us take care of that while you take home your new car tonight. It didnt feel like I had a new car until Jake started walking me through all the things inside. I want to thank Jake for helping us and being so patient. And Thanks Ed for handing us off to someone great! After months of tracking this color down, Im glad I was able to buy from it from these guys.<//Review>

I HAD BEEN TO 3 DEALERS IN THE SACRAMENTO AREA AND HAD NO SUCCESS EVEN THOUGH I WAS PREAPPROVED THROUGH MY CREDIT UNION AND EVEN THOUGH THEY HAD ALL 3 TOLD ME THEY CAN GET ME WANT I WANT FOR MY PRICE. ALL 3 DIDNT WORK WITH ME ONCE THEY SAW ME IN PERSON AND TRIED TO GET ME TO SPEND MORE AND 2 OF THEM WERE SELLING CARS 2-3K MORE THAT OTHER DEALERS FOR THE SAME EXACT MODEL.  ****AUTONATION*** CAME THROUGH FOR ME AND MY FAMILY. THE SALESMAN JEFF WAS GREAT AND WE HAD A DEAL IN LESS THAN 30 MINUTES AT A GREAT PRICE FOR A CAR MY FAMILY LOVES. TIME IS MONEY AND ALL THE OTHER DEALERS WASTE TIME> AUTONATION IS #1 IN MY BOOK AND I WILL GO THERE FROM NOW ON!!!< /text>

We just bought a Honda Civic from AutoNation Honda Roseville, and had a fantastic experience there. The sales person, Vikash Reddy, was very nice and extremely professional (thanks Vik). I made contacts with him by email and telephone before going to the dealership and he gave me price quote by email, which I believed was a good price. When we went to the dealership the pricing had changed and the new price was higher than the price he quoted. Vikash said he was going to try his best to keep his promise and give us the quoted price. He talked to his manager, who came out and met with us in person and explained the situation. Then said they care a lot about customer satisfaction and their reputation. Even though the new price was higher he said he will keep their promise and authorized Vikash to give us the promised price. It was very nice of him. We really appreciated the way they handled the situation. They were very professional. We left the dealership with a great impression, and in future we will consider them first if we decide to buy another Honda. Keep up the good work.< /text>

< Review>
I conducted a lot of research into purchasing our 2017 Civic LX Sedan all over the Bay Area. I even went down to the Palo Alto Honda dealership that's always on the radio claiming to be the lowest prices. You know the one that says if you want to save a lot of money come to Ander*#%n.
To my surprise, Tai, the Internet manager, was able to beat their best price by over TWO THOUSAND 💵. I loved the service I received from Tai Cai and Steven Jackson. They are both very friendly and caring sales professionals!!! I highly recommend these two to buy a new Honda from.
I did have to wait way too long to complete the deal with Financing but I know there was nothing that Tai or Steven could do on that aspect. Overall, I'm extremely happy and Steven even threw in a full detail at a future date for our new Civic!!!!!👍👍👍

For me, AutoNation Honda Roseville gets a 5 out of 5.

They offered no pressure to sell, when I was ready to purchase, they went out of their way to secure pretty much exactly the vehicle I was looking for.. well, my 2nd choice in color, but still very good considering how hard it was to locate the particular car I wanted with the specifics I also wanted in options, as well.

They were friendly and offered a great price on the car as well as finance options.

HOWEVER... Although I've been a long time fan and Honda driver and overall I believe they offer great quality, style and price, regarding the 2015 Fit I just purchased, I have to say for Honda as a company itself (not the dealership itself), I was a bit disappointed.. would have given them 4 out of 5 (possibly lower since the though of having one pay for the cargo cover at such ridiculously high price is a bit infuriating) because they are making me pay for a cargo cover which in every single new car I've ever purchased, was always included (my 93 Acura Intergra included it, my 2003 Mini Cooper S included it, and my 2004 VW R32 included it).. it shouldn't have to be an option to have a cargo cover in the rear of a hatch back, especially!.. and to ask around $200 ($300 to install a clip on piece?!), that's highway robbery!  Not cool, and I really desire and would have expected a rear cargo cover to be included with the car, especially a hatch back so whatever you stow in the rear is covered and out of sight.

Going back to AutoNation Honda Roseville, I want to reiterate my experience was great and that dealership and it's people gets a 5 out of 5.< /review>

We were in and out in about 1 hour thanks to the whole team for the accommodations to our Easter schedule. We were able to share our new vehicle with our friends and family which means alot.  From Cai to Mike and Dominique.   They were all very nice and professional and not uptight at all, like some other dealerships. It was like we were dealing with friends.  Even when we were done the Samoan man came out and gave us a hug and congratulated us. I give praise to this team for making us feel welcomed and handling everything swiftly. Coming back for my coffee mugs have them ready hahaha. Thank you Roseville Honda!<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

<Rate>5</Rate><Text>I have been looking for a new 2016 Honda Pilot for about two weeks. I was in contact with both Elk Grove Honda and Maita Honda and couldn't get a deal done and was planning to give up and look for a different car. Both of these dealerships were not upfront and had dealer mark ups on everything. 3k over MSRP because the car is in high demand or 42k for the car but when I walk in to the dealership there was an additional 6k worth of accessories installed on the car which was not acceptable to me. My buddy recommended that I give Autonation a call. Best advice ever. Sonny and Imran got me exactly what I wanted within an hour! They found me what I wanted, gave me a great price on my trade in, gave me a list of accessories that I can add if I wanted. I finished my paperwork and drove off in my new car an hour later. What more can you ask for? It was a great experience with no stress and feeling like they are trying to nickel and dime you to death. I will be recommending them to all family and friends for future purchases. The entire staff was wonderful.

<rating>1<//rating><text>On Sunday, July 26th there was a car sale organized by Provident CU in Redwood city. There were some cars from AutoNation Honda, and I happened to buy one of them. The guy who was doing a paper work was rude to me. He offered some extended warranty options and I didn't pick any.

Then we had a dialog like this:
TheRudeGuy: Why do you refuse to consider these options?
Me: Why would I?
TheRudeGuy: Because your car may break at some point and it's expensive to repair it.
Me: I'm not planning to break it.
TheRudeGuy: Are you some kind of magician? (yelling  to the whole office) GUYS, LOOK WE HAVE A MAGICIAN HERE WITH UNBREAKABLE CAR.

Really? You think it's the proper way to treat your clients? I get it, probably his commission depends on how many options I pick. But I assume he supposed to respect any choice I made. Even the one he doesn't like.< /text><Response>{'time': 1438876935626, 'text': "Ivan, we are deeply disappointed by your lackluster experience at AutoNation Honda Roseville.

<text>I was trying to get a car but the workers were too rude.
the guy named Steve was really helpful. He did everything he could to help me. I will give him 5 stars but I didn't like these two other workers. It was a lady that does the financial agreement and a guy with the white shirt. First of all, when I came in the second time he lowered my monthly payment from $550 to $519 and told me I can only lower it to that if I paid $5 down payment. And then this lady came in to make me sign the papers and said "is $5 ok for you, its not too much"? She was been rude and paying $5 down payment thats a joke. I think they were making fun of me and been rude. Then when I came back to return the honda bcs the monthly payment was too high, the same lady came in and said "oh you come here every day, i think you should start working here" she made unnecessary comments. So, I dont recommend to go there. They are rude when they cant get what they want.
But I only had bad experience with those two. Other people were helpful!< /text>< pics>

<GmapID>0x809b1f8cb7689c85:0xfd027cebb953408</GmapID><text>All I can say for someone who is willing to go there to purchase your next car is  Wesley honored the quote, financial officer, Ikaika did wonderful job for finalizing the contract documents in half an hour. Out-the-door-price was exactly what I expected. Kindness, fast process, no haggling at financial office were exceptional things that I experienced. Please find Wesley, Mia, Frank, Ikaika team in this store. They do not waste your time. They were a great team for me.
I bought my new 2015 Honda Accord Sport from Autonation Honda Dec/30/2014. Wesley Stewart helped my there. I emailed him before going to dealer he gave very good price upfront. Since I am living in Nevada, I had to travel about 4 hours distance to check the car. I was not sure that Wesley honored the quote or not but as soon as I got into the Autonation, it turns out that Wesley absolutely honored it(EXACTLY same number on the document). From the starting of the purchasing process, I was happy about it.
At the end of year, there were about 20 customers in the store and Wesley arranged me with Mia to show me the car that I wanted. After briefly check, I met Frank who gave me the exact price that I need to pay. I compared outdoorprice with monthly paymentX54 months which turns out great. I started paper work with Ikaika and he did everything that I needed. So, do not worry about haggling in the financial office at Roseville Honda. My experience was that financial officer just suggested me to add some maintenance options. just suggested. Once I said  I do not need it, they did not push me to add options. That's it.
As a school employee, I like ones who do not lie on anything. Wesley, Mia, Frank, Ikaika are those ones. I would definitely recommend my friends to go to Roseville Honda for their next car.</text><username>Hyung Woo Choi</username><Rating>5<//Rating>< UserId.>

<review>I visited the dealership this past weekend, January 20, 2014, and was looking forward to purchasing a Honda S2000. Prior from making the trip to Roseville, I contacted the used car sales department and was helped by a salesperson named TJ. TJ was asked various questions from any chip, bemished, or damages to the vehicle as I informed TJ that I will be driving from Fresno, CA to Roseville, CA. TJ insisted the car to be clean inside out without any damage to the paint beside the chip on the rear bumper. Upon arrival, I was disappointed after I inspected the car in person. The car was missing the passenger visor and the interior was overly spary with armor all. As I swipe my hand across the dash, my hand was dirty with dust and debris. The exterior of the car appeared to be fine but the front bumper was severly scratch on the lower portion of the bumper. There was a half of an inch scratch on the trunk on the passenger side which the metal was showing. The car was not what TJ described on the phone before I made the trip to the dealership. TJ offered to reduce the price by $500 for not realizing the visor was missing. I left the dealership disappointed and upset that TJ lied about the vehicle. I will not be doing business with Honda in Roseville again.< /review>< Time>

We are USAA members and used their buying service.  They referred us to AutoNation Honda.  I worked with an individual via telephone (out of Florida) who was very helpful.  We schedule and appointment and took a no-pressure test drive with Kyle.  He was AWESOME!  He was very knowledgeable about Honda products and the process.  We were looking for a very specific vehicle (White AWD CRV w/beige interior & nav).  There was NO vehicle anywhere in CA meeting our criteria.  After a little research he was able to locate one that was pending shipment.  It took a several weeks but we finally got the exact car we wanted and at a great no-haggle price.  We worked with Brian Machado also and a great finance guy.  The entire process was painless and smooth.  THANK YOU!

Also, we had a problem with the headliner and took the car in the next day.  The service coordinator was great and everything was handled smoothly again.< /review>

< Review>
I bought a 2014 Honda Accord V6 Touring from Autonation Honda Roseville and the overall experience was great. The internet salesperson, Dominick Daurizio, was extremely knowledgeable and easygoing. He let me leave the dealership after my first test drive without any hassle (the Toyota dealership was the complete opposite... I felt like I was being kidnapped). About 2 weeks later, after I had narrowed it down to the car I liked, I came back ready to buy and Dominick was easy to negotiate with. I also had the luxury of having a friend with me who is a GSM at another dealership, so he made cutting through the haggling hassle/process very easy.

The financing went smoothly as well. I brought in a pre-approval from Golden One, which had me at 2.79% APR for 60 months and their department got a me a deal at 1.9% for 60 months. Quick and easy.

My only hangup at all was when I was going over all the warranties and services they offer. I don t remember the gentlemen s name, but he had just bit of that sleazy salesman feel to him. Don t get me wrong, he was polite and all, but even after my buddy (the GSM who knows the ins and outs) told him to please just give us his best prices up front, he still went into cheesy salesman mode. Only after I declined the extremely high priced 7 year warranty (well over $2,000) did he remember that there was some specials and some Honda cash that he forgot about. After dropping the price a bit, and adding an extra year onto the warranty, I went ahead and purchased it. My friend let me know that the price could have gone lower, but it was already close to 11pm and I was ready to get the show on the road.

Overall, I was very happy with my experience purchasing my Honda Accord V6 Touring from them. The sales department was extremely, friendly, fast and accommodating. I m reading a plethora of 1 star comments on their service department, so I m really hoping that I have a positive experience with them when I go in for oil changes and repairs.</Review>

<review>Not impressed at all with our experience at Autowest honda! Purchased a car there 2 1/2 years ago along with a warranty! Decided to cancel the added on warranty considering it did not cover anything that went wrong with the car! (This was August of 2012 mind you) of course the dealership lost the paper work. After countless number of phone calls to them I was told that it would be taken care of! Still two months after it was supposed to be cancelled I was still being charged for it! So I took matters into my own hands and called the warranty company myself to get it cancelled,, It is now Jan 6th, 2013 and I have called NUMEROUS times and left a million messages and NOT ONE time has ANYONE called me back to say that things are being taken care of and we will be getting our refund!!!! I've never dealt with a worse car dealership then this one and would not recommend them to anyone!!</review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

<Review>The sales person are complete idiots. They have no idea on what the car is equipped and they have no manners on how to talk to a customer.

Beware they will butter you up if you're going to buy a car or they will kick you out the door if you don't buy a car with them.

< review>
Service for a car we bought here was more expensive than alternatives, and I wasn't pleased when AFTER I had called to describe the problem AND had the car towed up (paying extra for distance),
a) first I was told that I would only have to pay for the $155 diagnostic IF they even had the tools to do the repair (otherwise, for my 2005 Pontiac Vibe they'd refer me to a Chevy or GMC dealer, and the tow would be my problem!), and
b) when I had a question about which engine was in my car (admittedly, the two options referenced by another mechanic off the top of his head turned out to be incorrect, there is only one engine in this car), the tech had no idea.<//review>
