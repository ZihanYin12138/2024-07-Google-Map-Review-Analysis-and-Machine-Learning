Good haircut at an affordable price. Pro Tip: Check in first on the app before leaving your house and you will save time waiting in line there.</review>

<review>First time there since moving to the other side of town. Was impressed with how the flow is being managed in light of all the covid-19 protocols. Stevie was fantastic. Engaging, professional, made sure to inform me what she was doing. Explained the new procedures for removing drapes, hot towels and the like. Costs more than I’m used to, but it’s convenient for me and not so much that I felt I didn’t get my money’s worth when I was done.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>{'time': 1591270473529, 'text': 'Thanks for the review Brian.

Had a great experience.  There was a wait, to be expected, but the staff worked efficiently and communicated well about the wait time. Amanda expertly cut my hair and was easy to talk to.  The facilities were clean, modern, and the price was fair.  I’ll be back.< /Review>

Gabi was my hair stylist last week at the Ft. Washington location.  She did a wonderful job, was polite, fast and cut my hair with very little direction on my part.  She proceeded to give me the best shampooing massage ever.  I will return.<//text>

I wasn't satisfied with my cut. The woman was nice and it is not her fault since I wasn't able to express myself to tell her what I wanted. But I think a stylist should be able to anticipate what the customer wants. She was very nice so don't blame her entirely.</text>

My first time bringing my 11 year old twin boys to get their haircuts. Each boy had different ladies and both were very sweet, BOTH did a GREAT job! The place was clean yet lively with the sports going on the TV’s! We loved it. I will be a returning customer.</text>

My stylist Gabby P. always goes out of her way to make sure my haircut experience is amazing! She consistently ensures that my cut, wash and style is to my liking and is always willing to correct something if I’m not satisfied. She is always neat and her station is clean and organized and her positive attitude makes her a role model employee at this location. I highly recommend her to anyone who wants a great cut and an overall amazing experience at Sports Clips!</Text>

Renee was attentive to my boy and to me.  Our haircuts looked great as we walked out and they continue to please us and those who have noticed.

The extra featrues like the warm wet towel, the shampooing and the shoulder massage are topped only by the free neck and ear "trims" that are offered between cuts.

The package is titled MVP, and we certainly felt valued as we left.</Text>

Sports clips is a great place to get a quick, professional haircut with out breaking the bank.
The store is super clean, they have online check ins and the employees are super sweet and quick.
I reccomend Sherri as a stylist and the full MVP cut, the shampoo is worth the price of admission alone. Don't forget to tip!
Thanks ladies, hope to see you soon!</text>

<review>I went to this location after receiving a free haircut coupon. They make you sign in at the front and I waited for almost 20 minutes. After all my time waiting the manager said the coupon was not valid because my phone number showed I had already been their before 11 years ago. I am only 20, I did not have a phone when I was 9 years old! The manager rudely  claimed that their was nothing she could do. Overall I found her response very unprofessional. She could have told me before she made me wait 20 minutes that the coupon was not valid because I tried to give it to the staff when I first walked in. For the price I would strongly recommend people go elsewhere. Many other places offer much better customer service at a lower price.< /review>< Pics>

<text>Checked in on line as I drove up from NAS Lemoore and don't have time to wait around. Went into the location and there was one name in front of mine on the list. The stylist I asked for and another finished at the same time. The stylist I asked for took the person on the list in front of me and the other stylist took the person after me because I asked for a specific stylist. Was told i could wait another 15-20 mins. No thanks.<//text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

The online check-in doesn\'t "make an appointment" with a stylist, so unfortunately if someone came in just a minute before you showed up and also requested that stylist, you would have to wait the approximatley 15-20 minutes that it would take for her to finish that client.

< Review>
Excellent happy hour! The setting was quite lovely. The price for the cheese, 2 glasses of wine and charcuterie at happy hour was very reasonable ($33). There is a very wide selection of cheeses and a solid selection of cured meats.  Everything was very nicely presented and the staff were super!< /Review>

<name>Nancy Poertner< /name><text>We had a cheese/sausage  picnic package delivered to our home,  but unfortunately it went to one of our neighbors. Without hesitation, Venissimo delivered a second one the next day. We enjoy everything in the picnic on our road trip up to Santa Ynez. Super products, super service. Everyone was so nice and easy to deal with.</text>< GmapID>

Knowledgeable, pleasant and friendly.  A decent wine selection to pair with the cheeses.  They have everything for you to put together a cheese platter or you can even order tray for your next event.< /text>

Mary helped us select the perfect cheese and meat selections along with all the additional gourmet condiments to fit our tase and budget. The shop was also able to display their products on an extra large board we provided.

Excellent service and quality. We will definitely be back. Highly recommend... and delicious sandwiches if you get hungry from all the cheese shopping!</Review>< pictures>

OMG!! The 'go to' place for great cheese in the Del Mar area! Imported from around the world you couldn't ask for more!! Have a sandwich and a glass of wine for lunch or register for one of their pairing events. Always a great venue for anything cheese!</text>

I can't say enough great things about Venissimo Cheese. We average 2 to 3 visits every year and those are always occasions where we take a class or attend an event. We have taken many classes and have always enjoyed learning from the staff. This is a place that strives to treat customers as if you are bellying up to the Cheers bar. You know, "You want to go where everybody knows your name, where they're always glad you came." This is what Venissimo staff does. They make you feel at home and welcome. They are happy to share their knowledge and love of cheese with you. They readily hand out samples so that you may find something you can love as well. They make an effort to remember you and make you feel special. This is definitely a favorite place to go and a place to share with others. Thank you, Venissimo!</text>

<Text>I went to Venissimo and at the checkout the server told me I could choose to leave a tip. This was and is greedy and is moral blackmail. I asked for the cheese and meat I wanted and was given it. Why would I tip? Are the staff underpaid? I drove 30 miles to visit the store and 30 miles back. You can tip me next time Venissimo. Asking for a tip for simply serving me is outrageous. Tell you what, I'll just serve myself next time. How would that be?</Text><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>{'time': 1562849832499, 'text': 'Sorry you feel that way, Stewart. Tipping in any service business, including ours, is always optional.  Our mongers often spend lots of time with people to help create a special occasion, and for that, they deserve a tip if a person is inclined to give one.'}<//Resp>< GmapID>

We went on a Saturday night while waiting for our daughter to finish cotillion. The place looked interesting. We made plans to go back the next day with our kids. We ordered the cheese and charcuterie board with a glass of red wine for the adults and soft drinks for the kids. The staff were very knowledgeable and created the combination according to what we like. The atmosphere was serene and it was nice to find a spot to steal away from the hustle and bustle outside. The triple cream triple butter Brie was exceptionally smooth, the salami and the prosciutto was of high quality.  We will be returning.< /Review>

Staff was very welcoming. They never disappoint with the selection of high heels. They have a sale wall, so there's a nice selection of shoes to veiw on sale every single day. The store is a hidden gem!<//Text>

<Review>Good place for inexpensive kids shoes.  We kind of felt like we were interrupting something as they were having a sing a long of some type when we came in. We couldn't tell who was working and who was the visitor/customers.</Review>< Pics>

Good for a quick meal. Have a $7.50 burrito lunch special that includes a drink and chips. Salsa is always fresh.<//Text>

I ordered California veggie bowl and taste was ok. It costed me $7.30 and the quantity they gave was not even worth $5.00. The bowl was only little more than half-filled. It was certainly not worth the price.<//text>

< Review>
I choose a burito overstuffed and it looks like those burito from supermarket. Too smal, cold and poorly staffed.
The staff was too busy with a big take out order.
I paid almost 9 dolares on a burito.
Don't do it to yourself.
The bathrooms are clean.<//Review>

<Review>Super bland.  I ordered a special shrimp burrito.  There must have been at least half an onion in the burrito.  I mean, I like onions, but that was overkill.  Very little flavor and overall disappointing.< /Review>< Name>

Quick and fresh Mexican type food that you can take to go or eat in primarily during lunchtime.  They usually have an express lunch special burrito that's a good deal and includes chips and a soda.</review>

< Review>
We were a group of 8 trying to find sitting at Cups Cafe on a Sunday. Our wait time was 1hr but the host was super nice and kept doing time checks with us and really did his best to seat us all together. Our waiting team was efficient and knowledgeable about the menu. The only problem I had was that I ordered the fish and chips and there was some plastic cooked into it. The manager was super helpful and even offered me something else to eat and helped to rectify the situation. That did not put a damper on our fun at all and I will definitely visit again, especially for the cinnamon swirl French toast!< /Review>

Let's be fair. Great atmosphere and honestly over the top customer service I have had nothing but smiles and multiple offers if I need anything I truly appreciate that thank you.

4 stars only because the gentleman that dropped of my food did not ask me if I need anything as I watch the tables next to me get that offer. No biggie I don't mind asking for hot sauce just by the time I got that then I notice no butter or jelly for my toast

I know I could have asked a second time and they would be happy I'm sure just don't like having to ask multiple times for basic things like that it makes me Feel I'm being over needy when I just want the standard hot sauce and butter for my toast that's all.

I still left 20% for my main waitress she did an excellent job as did the rest of the staff over all a good experience and felt the effort was there for me to have a wonderful breakfast and for that I thank you.</text>

<review>Meeting with a friend for lunch at Cups Cafe per his recommendation. Nice staff very good but for me that's where it ends. Ordered a Cobb salad that was over priced and under delivered. The only other gripe I have is it took a very long time to finally get our food. However they were busy. I won't go back next time it's  Burgers and Brews for better food and service.< /review>< resp>

We came here during COVID, while spending a week in Palm Desert. We were looking for a spot for a boozy Friday brunch and this was perfect!

I got the cups omelet, which was SUPER unique, with mushrooms, brie, apple, and cilantro. The omelet itself was pretty thick and felt like way more egg than was needed, but if you're looking for a filling brunch meal, this is definitely it. It was so much food, plus two pieces of toast, and that was with a said salad instead of potatoes. I can't imagine finishing this, or even coming close, with all of that.

For some reason the bottle of champagne was half price (no complaints!) so I got a whole bottle for $9, plus a glass of OJ to mix it with. It was great.

We had great service, our food was tasty, and we'd definitely come back!</Review>< Pictures>

What a wonderful cafe that we discovered while traveling through to Arizona!! The freshest ingredients and amazing menu with twist between American and Mexican food. Serving sidings are generous also! Now, let me talk about the owner we met and the wait staff. Friendly, competent, helpful and right there with more coffee! I was a waitress for over 15 years back in the day... every one of these gentlemen were awesome!! We will be back!! Lovely patio too, and inside was decorated so well!!</Text>

<review>First we want to start off by thanking the owners Marcos and Nancy for Cups Cafe.The ambience is so energetic and the staff are always friendly.The menu is not what you would find in a traditional Mexican cafe yet delicious. Try the chilaquiles.  We will be coming back again and again!
Open daily from 7 a.m. to 2 p.m.</review>< pics>

This place is very welcoming and "homey". My boyfriend and I had brunch last week and we fell in love with the place. The hibiscus iced tea is a must. The staff is incredibly helpful when indecision kicks in. Amazing.</text>

Comfort Food at Cozy “Cups Cafe” - We were invited by friends for breakfast at Cups Cafe - it also serves brunch and lunch.   The atmosphere was fun and a bit eclectic with a collection of mirrors on one wall and a large “cups” clock on another.  The service was friendly - we were warmly greeted by Marcos one of the owners - and there was lots of indoor and outdoor seating.  The menu was full of interesting items.  One friend enjoyed the avocado toast saying it was delicious and wonderfully presented (see pic).  Another found the shrimp frittata very tasty.   We hope to return soon.  Helpful Hints: Cups Cafe just got a liquor license.  I imagine it won’t be long before you will find Mimosas and Bloody Marys on the menu.  Parking isn’t a problem - there is plenty.< /Text>

This was a fantastic little place, with great food, and adorable decor. I got the choose your own omelette with bacon, queso fresco, and avocado. It was so flavorful, and came with a large serving. It's definitely worth a try :)</text>

My daughter and I had a fantastic brunch yesterday. Goof was exceptional and so was the service. We sat outside properly distanced, the servers were properly attired and I would recommend Cups to all.</Review>

Fantastic, hidden-away cafe that is much larger than it looks.
The food is fabulous and homemade.
The hamburgers are made from fresh, top ground sirloin.
The Ahi salad is more Ahi than salad.
I've only just discovered this place but I can't recommend it more highly.
If you've never been in, I think you will be pleasantly surprised<//Review>

<Rating>5<//Rating><text>Let me just say, what a pleasant surprise! My hubby and I were out and about, and looking for a place to eat. Hubby found this cafe in a Goole search. I'm a creature of habit, he's much open in trying new places. I'm so glad I gave in and agreed to try Cups Cafe. The food was outstanding. I had breakfast and my husband had the hamburger. You may be thinking, anyone can cook breakfast, right? Well, I'm Uber picky about my eggs. They have to be scrambled fluffy and well mixed. No brown spots! Well, they were perfect. My buttermilk pancake was homemade, not from a mix. My husband's burger was ground top sirloin. Juicy, tender, and cooked to his liking. His potato wedges were also seasoned to perfection.  Jaime our waiter, was a true gem. Knowledgeable and kind...Thank you Cups Cafe!</text>< Pictures>

Awesome food! I had the breakfast wrap and absolutely loved it! They also have a very tasty homemade hot sauce (really good but really spicy) if you’re feeling adventurous. The owners are very nice and the wait staff are attentive. Will definitely be back!<//Text>

My friends and I have eaten there a few times after yoga and the food is well prepared, expertly presented and quickly gobbled up!

Their coffee has a distinct flavor that leads me to believe it’s a custom roast.

From burgers to pancakes and eggs, this is one of the hidden gems in our valley!< /review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

I ordered their omelet on special with lots of veggies, a side of rye toast, fruit, and hashbrowns along with a yummy (not too sweet) vanilla latte.

I ordered 2 club sandwiches to go and an iced tea, the sandwiches were 13.95 ea. My bill came to 38.00! Don't even tell me she charged me for sides, when she said what sides do you want with your sandwiches? Very, very misleading! I will never eat there nor recommend your place. She should have said " and for an Xtra such and such, you can  get these sides! Terrible!</Text>

I just check you order it was 33.24 each sandwich cost 13.95 plus you ordered 1 ice tea your total bill was 33.24 plus 5 dollar tip. She never over charge you. But if you think our menu is over price im sorry but our quality is what you pay for.'}</response>< gmapID>

<review>Outstanding service provided by the owners. The food equals the level of service. A nice new place for breakfast or lunch whose owners strive to succeed based on great food and great service. They’re well on their way. Great example of local small business ownership providing great service. Give them a try you won’t be disappointed.<//review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

Great offerings for Lunch Special. I tried the cod tacos of which you get 2, side of Caesar salad, and added on a Clam Chowder for extra $1.95. Clam Chowder was delicious, will get a bowl of it next time. I chose deep fried cod for my tacos. It was perfectly cooked but lacked a little salt. Still, it was very satisfying and taco toppings and the caesar salad were nice and fresh. The octopus with thin sliced cucumbers sounds very appetizing to me so that will be my next culinary adventure.
I'm back 9-1-2017! This time I had the lunch special 2 cod tacos with a side of sweet potato fries with a dip... Oh yummy!!! Perfect combo. Brought my friend, she LOVED IT. We'll be back many times over. Customer service is excellent all around.</review>

Now personally I don't eat fish, but I bought this for my partner and let me tell you great reviews. Even when I got it home it was still hot and fresh and crispy . It smells so good I almost wanted to eat it myself. If I wasn't allergic to anything made of fish it would have been gone yum. Great price friendly atmosphere place was very clean that puts a five out of five stars for me. Enjoy<//text>

<text>This place is amazing. Excellent food and excellent service. Very pet friendly as well. They served my Bellissima girl a bowl of water and a doggy treat. I was so appreciative as was she. It's so nice to find a place where customer service is clearly still a priority. Loved every second and returned the next day with my mother whom also loved every second. Thank you Cups!<//text><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

<review>Never been to Cups Cafe so made a date with my wife and her girlfriend to have lunch here. The November weather was ideal so we asked for patio seating which turned out to be perfect. We perused the Menus & our new surroundings. The setting was great, there is also a lot of indoor seating with large window views to the patio. It was Kool that Dogs are welcomed out here. The hours are 8am-3pm weekdays, 7:30am-3pm weekends. They offer beer & wine, some Vegan items, breakfast all day and a kids menu. I did a delicious breakfast wrap and our friend had a bun-less cheeseburger with these tasty home-made chips which we all had to try. My wife had fish & chips that she didn’t finish. When asked she said they were ok. The decor inside and out was nicely done and the service was 5 star; way above average. On our next visit I’ll check out an order of their fish & chips.</review>< rating>

< Review>
The tacos I had were fresh and tasted ok. The sauces and the (Yucca?) fries were a little too sweet for my taste. The restaurant was clean and the staff was attentive. The prices were a bit prohibitive for me to return and try it again.</Review>

<Resp>None</Resp><review>Had great expectations for this restaurant but was disappointed.  Prices are very high for what yu get.  Service was slow.  Waiter never came and asked how our meal was.  Clam chowder was not bad but needed more veggies.  It looked like white cream sauce with a can of clams thrown in.  Had fish and chips.  Smallest pieces of fish I’ve ever seen.  If we go back, would try the fish tacos.<//review>< name>

<Review>It has wonderful food 💛💛 I had the crab cake appitizer 🦀 It was two good sized crab cakes with a mango salsa (which I wasn't sure I would like, but I did) It also had small, yellowish "orbs" in the salsa,, umm ok, so I asked and it was boba (like in boba tea) and the combination was out of this world. It also had a nice side salad with really good Italian dressing. It was plenty for lunch and hit the spot. It was also served beautifully. We were a group of 9 and everyone got something different and it ALL looked good. They brought us out two complementary desserts that we all shared that were delicious as well. I would definitely return 😊</Review><pics>None< /pics><Response>None<//Response>< Gmap_id>

<response>None</response><Review>Got a Covid-19 test here - twice.  They are SO fast at getting your results to you.  Go online and look for Covid-19 testing in Rancho Cucamonga, make an appointment, show up on time and you'll be through in no time.  I was in and out of there in less than 15 minutes.  I was tested on Friday at 8:05am and got my results (negative) texted to me Saturday morning at 7:45am!

<Review>I was there for my 1st covid-19 test. Pretty easy and straight forward. I did all the paperwork online when I set the appointment last night. I arrived, presented my confirmation email, verified my identity, tested, and was on my way home within 15 minutes.< /Review>< Response>

Terrible. They always have their inside courts closed for their youth teams and other dumb reasons. So stupid. Then we have to play on the outside courts. I may as well just go to a park!</text>

My 10 year-old is tall and skinny. I use to buy her jeans at Children's Place but now her jeans look like high waters. My husband suggested we buy her jeans at the Levi's store. She found her perfect fit! She was happy that they were her length and they didn't fit her big.</text>

<review>Not a huge selection here but obviously lots of jeans to choose from. Prices are nice and cheap and get less and less the More jeans you buy. Service was ok but it wasn't very busy and they were still pretty slow at serving. I am a big Levi's fan so will be back anyway. I imagine I just came at a bad time.< /review>< user_name>

<Text>(Translated by Google) All the jeans that you imagine, of all the colors that you like, in all the possible sizes. Even if you know your ideal cut it is a very good idea to explore other options. You will find classic and modern t-shirts, as well as jackets and a wide variety of accessories. Very good option to find a gift.

Called everyone in town at 330am for a flat tire. Headed to Los Angeles, and sure enough, no one answered my call. Even when the website said they were 24 hours in Fresno . My luck seemed as bad as my blown tire. Until I tried golden state towing. Sergio Answered my call and said he would be at my site in 10 mins!! Sure enough here comes Sergio and his main concern was my safety. He made  sure we were all safe and I appreciated that. Got us loaded up and drove us to Los Angeles. At a good rate too. Friendly and professional. I would give this guy a 100 star rating if I could. Thank you Sergio and god bless you and your company.<//review>

R & R Party Rental approved! On a job site got stuck in some mud, with my equipment. He was able to take me out and get us back on the road for our next deliveries. Highly recommend.</Text>

Gotta say they really helped me out big time. Its 1 am in the morning I barely got off work its freezing cold and I left my keys and my coat inside my car. Called golden state with my dying phone said they'd be there soon. 10 to 15 min later they were there and opened the door in matter of seconds sure the cost is hefty but I was just happy that someone was able to come at all. And Sergio helped me in laughing off the whole situation. I would definitely ask for their help again if I needed it.<//Text>

Myself my wife and my two children were in the truck with me when my water pump went out on Highway 99 I pulled over into a supermarket parking lot and called Golden State towing which they told me that they would send a driver out and told me for what I thought was a reasonable price. I was on the phone with my insurance company when the tow truck driver pulled up and I asked him for five minutes so that I could finish my conversation with the insurance company. He then proceeded to leave and go to another call and when I called them back they said it was going to be an hour for him to get back out to me and that they could not waste their time waiting for me when they were other customers as well. Why couldn’t they have waited for me for five minutes to finish my phone call and then pick my truck up and take it to where I needed to go since they had already allotted me the time it was going to take to tow my truck 6 miles I didn’t called the guy back and told him that an hour was not acceptable and I needed to speak to the manager at which point he said he was a night manager and if I didn’t like their policies I should go find my business elsewhere. I am a US Army veteran stranded on the side of the highway asking for help and the company refused to help me because five minutes of their time was too precious to give to me I would seriously reconsider using this company and use anybody else if you need a towel< /Text>

<Review>We had Golden state towing tow a 4 runner for us Sergio was on time and Sergio exceeded our expectations if there was 10 stars he would get it. His equipment is clean and customer service was excellent. We will definitely refer to all friends and family. Most tow companies don’t have the level of service Golden State has!!! Keep up the great work!!< /Review><date>1576786377863<//date></record>

Sergio has always been spot on with his service and professionalism.  Golden State Towing is one of the few tow truck companies in the valley that holds to traditional values.  If you need a tow rest assured that you are in great hands.</Review>

Got into a car accident today. Was kinda far from home. Called golden state towing. Sergio was very courteous and responded quickly. He kept me updated on how far away he was so I knew when he would arrive. He was very polite and told me all the steps i needed to take once i get ahold of my insurance. I would totally use this company again if needed and reccomend them to others! Thank you Sergio.</Review>

Great service, my truck shut down and Golden State towing arrived and got me home. I have a mini truck lowered. We were talking on the way home as to what it could be. Also got me right in my parking stall so we didn't have to push it and turn into it. Great skills and service. 🤙🇺🇸< /text>

Sergio was the most professional and helpful tow truck driver I’ve encountered! Minutes after being in a accident he was there quick and ready to help! He used extra boards to get my low car onto the truck safely and properly without any further damages! He is THE GUY to call for a tow in the Central Valley HANDS DOWN!</review>

<Text>My sister stepped out of her car for a quick moment left her car running somehow the car locked after shutting the door (yes, the car was turned on) we called triple a since that's our insurance so they can send a tow truck to unlock the wait time was about an hr, we figured that was a long time to wait since the engine was running, we then called Sergio he was able to arrive within 15 min after us calling him unlocked the car under 5 minutes all for a very reasonable price. Best tow company in town.. I recommend to all my friends and family. He is very professional. He is fast, reliable and friendly. Will be using him for all future occasions.<//Text>< resp>

All 3 times my Hubby got his 300zx Twin Turbo dream car towed home or to the autoshop, we got quality service, fast reply time, great customer service, came on time, and all for a reasonable price.
We highly recommend them over other tow companies, for all your towing needs.<//review>

Sergio was there to pick up my vehicle in less than 30 mins during rush hour.  He delivered the vehicle to the mechanic and had it unloaded in no time. Thanks again.</Text>

I start my day around 415am every morning. On this particular morning, I hit the wrong button while warming my car, and accidentally locked myself out. I googled fresno locksmith and this was the one open. After spending 40 minutes trying to unlock it myself, I gave in. Called them up for rush service and they showed in 20 mintues. It literally took him 5 seconds to unlock my car. I was amazed and annoyed all in the same breath of emotions, lol. Great and reliable service. Highly recommend.< /text>

If I could give more than 5 stars I would. My lady locked her key in the car again, so I contacted Fresno Locksmith Service. He was very professional and prompt. He was able to make me a new key and program it. Will definitely refer them to everyone. I saved their number because I know my lady will do it again lol.<//Text>

Lee was amazing!!! I gave a call and explained my situation he gave me a quote right then and there and I said I would call back in hopes we found my key however no luck and now he’s on his way to give us our new key. We had a quote within 3 minutes and speedy response via rekey and text message.

Thank you guys I will save this on speed dile  for the future</review>

Raj was rude upon arrival. I let Him know we he had to sign in to get into warehouse he wanted to charge extra for that. Guessing he wasn’t a real locks smith didn’t act like one. Couldn’t pick lock and He drove off fast and almost wrecked into traffic. Unprofessional. Called out KEY ME LOCK SMITH. They were out here in 10 min and got it right away. If i could give them negative stars I would. Guy was a dirt bag</Text>

<Text>I thought I had locked my keys in my 2015 Dodge Charger so I searched for a locksmith near me and Fresno Locksmith Service came up. I called them to come unlock my car as soon as possible. Harris came out right on time and got me in my vehicle, but then we had another problem. I couldn’t find my keys! Apparently I had lost my car key and needed a replacement key. I was 2 hours away from home so I was stressing really bad, but Harris told me they could actually make a new key for my car. So instead of paying a hefty amount to get it towed back home, I got a reasonable price for a new key for my car! These people are lifesavers! Superheroes! Thank you so much for your service 🙏🏻< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None< /Response>< gmapID>

Lee was fast with a short wait time. He was brief and got the key out quick. I would recommend  this guy and this company to anyone  who makes the unfortunate mistake of locking their keys in their car.< /Review>

I was told $75 cash then after I said yes and gave the make and model it was $99, unless I left a 5 star review. I've used them before but  not too sure I will again. They did charge me the $75 but only after I left a 5 star review. That is what I was not okay with. You can't quote one price, then change it and say leave us a review for the quoted price.<//text>

<review>Called and left 6 voicemails over a 24 hour period and never got a call back eventhough they allegedly offer 24 hour service calls.  Maybe you'll have better luck.

The response to my post is completely false because I never spoke to anyone at all.  As you can see from my review I mention leaving 6 voicemails and nothing about my interaction with a dispatcher.

Your lie to discredit my review wasn't thought out too well my man.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

Would not answer the phone and wants you to text them. Rates are pricey. Even if you agree to that they will then say at last minute that we are on our way but you are outside our normal limits so we will charge $XX  extra at last minute.
Seems like they resort to texting and this approach where someone who has been waiting  will  probably just say ok fine I will pay you the extra money come on over. They  are fishing and  little unprofessional  by not providing you an ETA  even. I ended up calling another.</Text>

Estimate on arriving was accurate, and the wait time that was told I was perfectly fine with  because it was a 20 minute wait which was better then other places telling me an hour. Price was perfect because others were charging more then I could afford. I would recommend this place to my family, friends and coworkers.< /Text>

Extremely ghetto and rude the guy kept going up on price trying to squeeze every penny out of me and when he came he didn’t even had the right tools and had to go back to get them taking an extra hour would never recommend them so unprofessional and charge the same as anybody else I called after to price check NEVER GO HERE< /review>

One Stop Lock & Key in Fresno was 100% true to their word in regards to the procedure as well as price. Mike was on time for the appointment, and was nice enough to wait an additional 5mins because I was running a lil behind. Hands down the lowest affordable price in Fresno and Clovis. Thanks again!!!!<//Review>

Best Locksmith service! Make sure to check them out. They helped me unlock my car when I most needed help. Really much appreciated. Especially being that it’s a few days before Christmas they definitely hooked me up quick with a decent price thanks once again..definitely hit these guys if you ever lock your keys in the car<//Review>

They were called before 5 pm;  since i was stranded at the store waiting in this Fresno HEAT; I was told the locksmith was called and texted. I called many times to get status but I wasnt asked for my location till about 9 pm. Then i was told i would have to pay $400 cash compared to the $220 I was origianally quoted... I finally had my vehicle towed since they never showed(I had to pay the evening rate), but I still endeded up paying cheaper using All Fresno Locksmith than what I was originally quoted with Fresno Locksmith.</text>

I just have to say  it was 1030 at night And one of my bedroom doors were jammed was not able to open it had to remove the door knobs once I contacted this locksmith they were able to walk me through on how to open the door  otherwise I would have to pay the 125+ additional fees to come out I’m so greatly appreciated for them sending me the pictures via text and showing me how to get the door completely open once again thank you so much for your time I would definitely recommend .

Great service!!!!<//text>

Wasn't going to make this review but here's  my experience. 2 guys came they seam fine showed up fast and everything was good. They where here for about an hour couldn't get my key made, they did make 1 key that only work on 1 door (car was already unlock) they tried messing whit all other doors whit key hole to no able tried whit ignition switch whit no luck. Like I said about an hour here could not get the job done, called someone else they did the exact thing they did that only work on 1 door this is where they got a code to make the key (passenger door lock cylinder) the other guy did and it work on all doors and ignition switch. He did it under 20 minutes and charge me $80 which was half of what these guy where charging me<//Text>

We did not charge you any fee since our technicians were not able to get the job done, even though they spent over 2 hours working on your vehicle. I am surprised you left us a negative review, because our technicians worked hard and tried their best to get a key made for you in the burning Fresno heat, but since they could not, they did not get paid anything and we did not charge you a penny. I hope you can consider this in rating another business next time. Have a wonderful time.\n\nBest,\n\nRay Dorris\nExecutive Manager\nFresno Locksmith Service'}< /resp>< GmapID>

I needed all the locks in my house and cars emergency replaced after my house was robbed in the middle of the night and he came out and replaced everything with excellent service at 3am! The ease of service and ability to get new and trusted locks in the middle of the night made a horrible situation just a little easier. Thank you so much for the amazing service and I hope I don’t need to call back again lol.</Review>

I called AND texted this business for service and it seemed like they didn't want business. They asked what service I needed and location, I told them, and no one ever replied. Super UNPROFESSIONAL. Guess they were too busy to take a client, even though they are supposedly available 24/7. I DO NOT RECOMMEND.</review>

<text>Highly recommend!! Another local locksmith said they could not get my lock opened. They offered to drill the lock out for $75 which would obviously destroy the lock and would require a new lock being installed. Costing nearly $200 by the time I replace the lock and keys. And that would leave me without a locking door until another lock was put on. Fresno Locksmith Service was able to get the lock open in 1hr from the time I called them till it was unlocked!!!!

<date>1549619619454</date><Rate>5</Rate><text>I've used Fresno Locksmith not once, not twice, but three times to make new car keys! First time, I lost my key to my 2016 Ford Explorer. I had called every locksmith in town; some didn't answer and other's didn't carry this key. Luckily, these guys had it and saved my day. They were able to program the new key to my car in no time with their advanced equipment. Since I had such a great experience with them the first time for key replacement service, I had them make spare keys for my other two vehicles: 2014 Hyundai Santa Fe and 2016 Chrysler 300. I'm glad I found a locksmith who can make keys for my cars since they're proximity smart keys; it was hard to find one but thanks again Fresno Locksmith. I highly recommend using them, they will even work with your budget. Enjoy!< /text>< pictures>

I conveniently text a quick photo and message to their number and moments later I’m contacted by the locksmith with his ETA. What I enjoy the most is when I think something is a huge deal, it is actually a simple issue and they walk me through how to do something actually saving me money. I appreciate you guys and your very professional, prompt service.</text>< user>

Had lost my keys while shopping at Target and the manager recommended and called this company where I was met by Ali, I had bought a new key fob from him for $238 which was supposed to unlock my doors and trunk which when I arrived home did not work so I paid extra for nothing Then to find out he left his programing device in my car, when he arrive and I told him about the issue he recommends another business who works on the mechanical unlocking aspect for another $150! My son found my keys in my car since he attached a Tile to it in between the driver seat and center console!

So when Ali comes and collects his machine, the next morning when I go to work I use my old found keys to start the car the engine doesn't start at all! Had to use the new key to start the car; so when I had free time at work I called the number on my log and told him what was wrong, he hangs up the phone! So that would mean he found my keys and disabled them.< /Text>

Was super helpful! I was having a problem with taking off my front door lock handle, I had the original instructions and tools and had been trying for some time and finally gave up and called. I was asked to send a couple photos of the lock/handle via text and I did and we tried working through a few things via text and then confirmed that most likely the lock itself was broken and that's why it wasn't coming off like it should and it would need to be destroyed in order to get taken off. I was given a quote for a response but was also advised how I could destroy it myself to get it off so that I didn't have to spend that much money on taking a lock off that was going to get destroyed anyway. I had the drill and tools to take it off and went to town! I really appreciated that the company wasn't trying to money gouge me when they easily could have, I was at my wits end and about to say take all my money just to be done with this debacle. I appreciated how helpful and honest the interaction was! I highly recommend!</text>

<Review>We lost our key for our 2008 Pontiac G6 and called Fresno Locksmith. They were quick to answer and gave us a quote for the key replacement. They even price matched and beat the price of other companies for automotive car locksmith. They were respectful and courteous to all my needs. They got the job done in a timely manner. I would highly recommend them to everyone, thanks again.< /Review><GmapID>0x809460a1c67452a1:0xcba23459d14cd0ba< /GmapID><Time>1533959571634</Time><pictures>None< /pictures>< Name>

I accidentally locked my keys in my apartment. Coincidently my apartment complex office is closed today for a mandatory training and none of the maintenance guys could assist me in getting spare key to my apartment so that I could open it up. Short on cash at the moment I had no idea what I was going to do and desperately needed to get in my home. I called this company as asked if they could assist me and they did just that. I appreciate them working with me on the price and coming out to help even after I was indecisive. Great company and are willing to help!<//Text>

Ali is the best! I locked myself out of my Dodge Caliber in a parking lot while it was raining. Ali arrived within 10 minutes, got me back in my car quick, & charged me less than the competitor! Thanks so much Ali &  Fresno Locksmith Service!<//review>

<review>I needed a spare key for my 06 Honda Odyssey. I called the Honda dealer and other locksmiths in town. Fresno locksmith had the best price in town. Ali met me within an hour of my call which was fantastic. Great service. Very professional. My new key was cut and programmed for my van and works with no issues. I highly recommend Fresno locksmith for your needs.<//review></record></dataset><record>

<text>I contacted them about programming my car's lock remote. Had attempted it myself with instructions that came with the replacement remote, but it wasn't working out on my own. Thought I needed to have the system reprogrammed, and that's why I contacted these guys. After talking to him, he said he'd call back to let me know whether they could do it and the price. Then I got a text with a pic from a YouTube video with instructions on how to do it myself. Followed these directions and it worked the first time!! Much respect for helping me help myself, and great follow up! Good good dudes-< /text><GmapID>0x809460a1c67452a1:0xcba23459d14cd0ba< /GmapID>< response>

<Text>I called Fresno locksmith after my wife locked her keys in her truck. They answered late in the evening and gave me a fair price. I told her I would talk to my wife about it. After I talked to the lady I noticed that the back window was open slightly. I got a text asking if their was anything they could to to help I.e. lower the price. In the end I was able to get it open myself but I was impressed with how they followed up with me and willing to negotiate the price. I would say y’all should wait a little longer before offering a lower price. I would have paid the initial price no problem. If I ever need a locksmith I will use them very impressed with the customer service so I’m sure the actual service would be great too.</Text>< Pics>

I locked myself out of my trunk where my keys were. I called Fresno locksmith to get a quote on getting a key made. They provided great service and were very helpful! I would for sure recommend them! They didn’t give me the run around like other locksmith company’s I called.< /Text>

I called them and they required a credit card to dispatch someone to me. No problem if your wallet is in your back pocket and not in your truck. Guess what call a friend ! I'm my case it was my sister in Florida 3 hours later than Cali good thing she was able to give them her card number to help because if not no help from any other service as well. So  when you plan on locking your keys in the car don't forget to keep tour credit card with you. Thank you Fresno mobile key.<//review>

I had a jammed internal part of a lock, and could not open the door despite taking off the entire door handle. It was a bit maddening getting so close to clearing the problem, but then having to break down and call a locksmith.

Fortunately, I was lucky in googling and finding Fresno Locksmith Service. Ali, their representative, contacted me immediately via text (and this was late, after business hours by the way). Ali asked for a picture, and then diagnosed exactly what I needed to do in a few seconds. Ali told me I didn't need the locksmith to come out for a fee, and then helped me solve the problem on my own. I was in the room in a few minutes.

I asked if I could send a Cash App payment for the trouble nad out of gratitude, but Ali refused payment, and said "my pleasure brother!" Fresno Locksmith Service has just won itself a new customer for life. Wow.  --Nathan Carson</text>

During these hours, the rate may be higher than regular business hours.\n\nIf you had notified us that you found a better rate, we would try to match the price, but our records indicate that you had not informed us that you received a better price.

Tonight was honestly the first night I have ever locked myself out of my own home. I did not even know what to do. I googled and called and No one was any help until I called Fresno locksmith. Even in the middle of the night they were able to make it to my house in a timely manner. Ali showed up, was courteous, friendly, and got straight to work. I was able to walk in my home in seconds. It was the best first time experience I could of possibly had during a time of crisis. Thank you Ali again for everything< /Text>

I never thought I could lock myself out of my house, but that's exactly what happebed to me yesterday. I got home at 1am and realized I didn't have my keys on me; I remembered I left them on the kitchen counter! Luckily these guys were open 24 hours and got to me in 20 minutes and got me inside my place in a few minutes! Highly recommend, lifesavers for sure.</Text>

<review>This is the best locksmith in Fresno.. Their cheaper than the rest of the lock smith in fresno. Very friendly n great customer services. I recommends this to everyone that want their keys made at a low cost. Ali was very helpful n very understandable. I give them a 10 star rating. I'm very satified with the work they have done.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

Wow! First time locking my keys in the car, locksmith Ali came out within 30 minutes, gave me two confirmation calls (before driving over and upon arrival), and got me to my appointment on time. Cost $65, with a positive attitude too -- nice!</text>

< review>
LIFE SAVERS don't even come close to describing the  people that work at Fresno Locksmith Service. I work really late and live out of town, right after work I realized I didn't have my car keys on my! Me and my coworker checked everywhere, literally, and could not find the damn key. It was already late and I thought I was out of luck to find anyone to help, but I called these guys and Ali showed up in 20 minutes at 2:30am! He was very friendly and knowledgeable about my vehicle. I don't have any clue how he did it (even though he explained everything while he was doing it), but he was able to make my key, program it, and have me on my way in less than half an hour! I am so glad I called this place, they saved me from a whole lot of headache. Now I can drive home and get some sleep. Thank you Ali and Fresno Locksmith Service for making a bad event feel not so bad after all. I will refer you to all my friends and family!< /review>

I broke my key for my 06 Honda Civic while I was putting gas. It was 10pm and I was worried I'd have to get it towed, but luckily these guys were open. They got to me really quick, like around 20 minutes. They made a new key for me, programmed it, and had me on my way back home. Thank you guys, you really are lifesavers.<//text>

Locked out at 130am and called for assistance. They were much easier to communicate with, I was calling another buisnesses for quotes and the rest of these competitors communication was horrible, they had a service take a message and wait by the phone for them to call you back. But not these guys, even text a photo of the dead bolt to ensure he would be able to open it.< /text>

Vegetable Chow Mein. Those noodles, so chewy and soft, I recall slurping them up. So many vegetables, so crunchy. Oil, salt & flavors made my meal dreams become a reality. I will continue to frequent this place, for it is THE place.</Review>

It's nostalgic that they've had the same location for so long. Food and service are great. I think I've tried almost everything on the menu at some point. FYI, lunch menu is a bargain.Very clean and relaxing environment. Been getting takeout here for years as well.<//Review>

Was looking forward to treating our house guest to a Chinese dinner. The four of us walked into an empty resturaunt and was seated and given menus and shortly after an asian family was seated and order taken and brought drinks as we watched and couldn't believe our eyes. I can honestly say we all felt discriminated against. Needless to say we walked out.< /Text>

The lunch menu is the thing you wanna look at if you're in for a quick to go deal! I got the kung pow shrimp with fried rice and it was delicious! Lots of veggies and a good scoop of rice, especially for 10-11 bucks! They had more on the menu and if I'm ever around again, I'll check it out!</text>

The food was okay...just felt they charged a lot like almost all chinese restaurants both small business owner & big chain franchise restaurants as well...i enjoyed the food but it was average and the rice was mushy which seemed to be soggy from sitting in the rice cooker from the night before and/or putting too much water and rinsing the rice too long which is something that is hard to mess up like that seriously how can you mess up making rice in a rice cooker ...? Also it be so much better white rice if all the places used real Jasmine or calrose rice instead of majority choosing lower quality extra long grain rice...to save a few bucks ...you can tell a lot about a asian restaurant just by the rice they serve ...<//Text>

Had dinner at this restaurant a couple of days ago when visiting Monterey, California.  Staffs were friendly, helpful, & service was great!  The proprietress even recommended fresh vegetables to go with our dinner.   The best part is their food REALLY DON'T HAVE MSG!   Food was delicious & in big portion.   Highly recommended...< /text>

Great location for a Chinese food. The food is pretty good and for local Chinese food this is the best you can get for Prunedale, Aromas and Salinas area. Staff are friendly and the prices is good. My favorites are hot and sour soup and kong pao chicken.<//Review>

<Review>We aren't short on ramen places nowadays and I'm biased, but this is still my default ramen place since 2014. Cool staff and spicy food that is actually spicy. My personal recommendation if you like hearty stuff is the kurugoma tan tan men.< /Review>< pics>

Great food. Been going here for years. Intimate and quick service. Has good vegan options too! Regular "Spicy" dishes isn't very spice so go with the spicy option if you like it hot.</review>

This used to be my favorite restaurant in Sacramento, period.  I haven't been for a while and decided to order in.  What I got was a major disappointment.  The broth was flavorless, and barely enough to cover the noodles. The egg was hard boiled and unseasoned.  When I called to ask why it was different than I remembered, I was interrupted repeatedly by the person on the other end of the phone.
I even asked if they were under new ownership, it tasted so different. If I had been sitting in the restaurant and served what I had tonight, I would have sent it back and left.

Based on the interaction with the person on the phone and the lack of flavor in the food, I won't be back.<//text>

<Review>Shoki Ramen never disappoints. They have options for non meat eaters like us. Portions are good. Staff are always helpful with any questions Guests might have and always make sure you are okay. The beer choices are more now as well.
The place is small so expect a wait, it is well worth your time.< /Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPLQdx37dG0ieUVbel2gpuRrWnWu5fw14pSPCCG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< time>

The super spicy tan tan men with extra chasu pork is the way to go! This place has the best ramen ever! If you like root beer try the local River City root beer.. it might just take you back in time.

Great service and a spot that my family and I keep going back to.< /review>

Japanesse ramen egg should not be well done like regular boiled egg. The yolk has to be moist and melted in mouth. Hope they could figur out how to make it since it is the key to perfection.<//Review>< Pics>

< review>
My favorite Ramen house in Sacramento!

*I recommend you try the spicy gyoza*

I had the #1, its based in a pork broth. Every bite was a myriad of flavors and pleasing to the palate. I ordered mine "regular" on th spicy scale, however I recommend you get it "extra" spicy if you like it just hot enough to get your nose running.

The wife ordered the same thing and expressed complete satisfaction with her meal.

Staff is warm and welcoming,  environment is small but enjoyable. Highly recommend,  I certainly will return.< /review>

<Rate>1< /Rate><Review>This place makes you wait an hour for a bowl of hot water and noodles. If you don’t care about your time and have nothing else to do with lots of time to waste then come here. They keep saying it’ll be 5 more minutes then 15 minutes pass by while waiting in the cold and you still don’t have your food. I will never come here again. If you cannot handle making orders within a timely manner then stop taking orders. Jesus. :|</Review>< Time>

Went here years ago, the food wasn't very good at all but thought I'd give it another chance. Bad idea. I rarely write reviews but this food was especially bad. Tried the special Macha ramen, it was extremely bland and the egg was just a plain hard boil egg (not a proper ramen egg). The fried tofu appitizer was absolutely terrible. It had no flavor at all, the dashi was worse than pre-made store stuff. My friends ramens were some spicy varieties (can't remember which), it was agreed that they were not spicy or very tasty at all. Takoyaki was nothing to brag about, but the best dish. Probably best to avoid this place and try one of Sac or Roseville's awesome ramen places.</text>

<text>Possibly the worst miso ramen shop I ve ever been to. And I visited a lot of ramen places. Plus waiter disappeared after bringing foods to our table. No spoons. Can’t split check.

Updated; came back another day. Super hot inside no AC.<//text>< pictures>

<Review>This ramen was bomb! Tonkotsu broth was completely on point, the noodles were curly, the vegetables were fresh. I'd reccomend going Godzilla style which is fried onions and garlic which gives the broth that much more depth. Will definitely be coming back here my next time in Sacramento.<//Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOYUETYK8QS5H9Cd4PszwgnoQDUdPOHnbjvmjbC=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures><Response>None</Response><Gmap_id>0x809ad126d6879097:0x1e9f6dba6a88b67e< /Gmap_id></record>

This place never ceases to amaze our stomachs!  Whenever we crave ramen (which is all the time), whether it is summer or winter, this is our go to location.  We love how there are vegan/vegetarian options as well.  The location is small but very cozy with an outdoor patio available.< /Review>

My first time but several coworkers state the other Ramen houses are just "Ok."

<Review>I ordered the 2nd of 2 ramen options listed in the Gluten - Free section. When it arrived I was a bit surprised that other than 1/2 an egg there was no meat included. Did I need to order that as an add-on item? And usually an entire egg would be included. I'd read reviews online and looked at posted menus but the menu I received was totally different.

The broth was good, although not as dense/flavorful as I'd like. Being how well made everything is and natural, I want to like this place so I will definitely try again.

I arrived about 1:15 pm on a Monday (4th of month) and there was plenty of seating inside. My ramen arrived very quickly (less than 5 minutes). There is street parking and small parking lots on either side of the building. At the time I came, there was plenty of available parking.< /Review>< Pics>

Best Ramen in Sacramento. It is always busy and for good reason. I have had to sit in the cold patio in the winter without a working heater so that I could get some of that warm good Ramen! This is seriously the best in Sac IMO.< /Review>

<text>I think this place is really hyped up. It definitely drew me to want to come in because of the fact that they make their broth from scratch sans MSG & preservatives!

Unfortunately the ramen did not blow our minds with amazing-ness. My bf and I admitted that we've definitely had better. My spicy tonkotsu didn't have a ton of flavor, it was a tad on the bland/mild tasting side.

I would rate this place a 3 star, but the customer service is amazing and I added an extra star just for that.

I don't think we will be returning here, but we did enjoy the overall experience here.</text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNPtuUxqGThzsXzfC7UoruZYaA2m9V1L9cqeuWd=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM0HN8vVsRUbpRWArjpbuAHND7cTs_yn8NJefz4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPUU_vtuWcVB8dxgna7pW14bGxIheWFLF-lKS3t=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures><Response>None<//Response><gmapID>0x809ad126d6879097:0x1e9f6dba6a88b67e</gmapID></record>

A great bowl of Udon. I have had the ramen prior to this visit. The aged tofu was wonderful as was the fried chicken ramen. A nice part of town, prepare for at least a 5 to 10 minute wait (more than likely longer) before being seated.< /Review>

<Review>I had the shio. Let's start with the good stuff. I liked that they had the tare available for guests to add more flavor to their broth, and it was pretty nice. The noodles had a good texture and bite. Bad: The arugula and lettuce were weird and clashed with the dish. I ate them first so I could enjoy the rest. The egg was hard-boiled and not marinated and seemed really low effort and the chashu was not marinated either. The broth was not served hot, merely warm by ramen standards. The gyoza was served with sauce already poured over it and was excessively sweet for all of us. The salt for the edamame was very large-grained which gave it a very uneven distribution and we ended up with parts too salty and parts not salty enough. It was luke-warm. Can't recommend it based on the shio and tan tan and the worst ramen shop I ever went to. Tastes may vary.< /Review><date>1572240362518< /date><Rating>2<//Rating></record>

Pretty good place to eat at. Food has a good amount of options but could've been better. Needed more options for drinks but not bad at all.<//review>

Some of my friends picked this ramen locaton as descent one, but my last visit was kind of disappointing. My friend ordered black tan tan men, but due to rack of broth-base flavour, he asked the server to remake. My order was a simple soy sauce ramen, but it went the same way as his... They forgot to put something when they made the soup base, it's clear that something was missing there.</text>

<review>Went here after going to the zoo today and my boyfriend and I were very impressed by the flavors and quality of the ramen! We had to wait to get in, which was the only down side but the capacity for the building is 40 people so it makes sense. They kept a very organized flow of people being seated and food being served. I would definitely return!<//review>< username>

<rating>5<//rating><review>The ramen was excellent. My waiter was very knowledgeable about the menu and the various ramen options (of which there were many). When asked, she explained all of the options and made an excellent suggestion for which ramen I should try. I had the Tan Tan Men with low sodium and thin noodles. One of the best I've ever had. One of the better ramen house in Sacramento. Is always crowded no matter what time we go. Definitely worth the wait.<//review>< Pictures>

<Text>I had the extra spicy miso with tamago (egg) as well as a large hot sake. The sake complemented the warmth and heat of the miso, and the soft boiled soy egg added a creamy element. The chashu pork was tender and the spinach and corn were a refreshing addition!< /Text>< Name>

This is one of the 2 best ramen houses around. The atmosphere here is a little more laid back than the other place so it's nice for a meal and a chat over good ramen. I really liked all of the different ramen bases on the menu, each with their own personality. The only criticism that I had was that the eggs were Hard boiled. It's nice to have a little bit of runny yoke to flavor everything else.<//text>

Ramen is good and at a good price. The broth isn't too rich to the point where it gets tiring after a couple bites.</text>

Amazing Ramen!!! Friendly staff and fresh food.  The seating is very limited so be sure to get there before the dinner rush or be prepared to wait a little bit.</Review>

<text>Shoki Ramen, one of the original Ramen houses in Sacramento, is a local institution. While they may have changed locations, sizes, and prices over the years, the overly quality and delicious nature of the soup has remained a constant.

There are plenty of other places to get ramen in Sacramento but why look further when this classic is still serving up tasty noodles and soup in their convenient downtown location?

There can be a wait almost any time of year as it is very popular, so be prepared for that. I visited in January and there was approximately 20+ minutes wait to get a seat just for 2.

Typical price is about $9.90 for your choice of many different ramen dishes, and sides/appetizers run from $3-4 to $6-7 depending. They even have a small poke bowl for under $7!

Check it out for yourself and see what all the fuss is about, you won't be sad that you did 🙂<//text>< Name>

Best Ramen House hands down! The excellent service from the moment you step in to the moment you step out is amazing! We were seated right away, no wait. Quick service. Waiter didn’t skip a beat and went out of his way to make sure that all of our needs were met. Highly recommend!<//review>

A nice, little, late night stop.  There was a bit of a wait for our group of 5, since every table inside was taken.  It was cold outside until someone turned on the heaters. After being seated we were quickly helped and our bowls were hot and delicious.  I'm guessing the more you come here the easier it is to figure out what to order.  The staff is too busy to explain what everything is.  It's worth a visit.< /review>

Really decent ramen, if you take out the corn. Gyoza was also good but I would prefer pan fried over deep fried.

I used to think it was Shoki and then every one else, but now I can barely tell the difference with their ramen. They changed some things with their ramen and now it's just above average maybe. Noodles still have good texture, broth is ok, toppings underwhelming. Still has a cool quaint vibe though with friendly staff. No longer my first choice, I'll go to Ryujian or Binchoyaki.</Text>

This is probably some of the best ramen in Sacramento. They came recommended with high praise and I can see why. There are so many options for flavors and meats and toppings, that you can really make your ramen your own. I highly recommend the spicy garlic edamame for an appetizer too.< /text>

If I could it would be 3.5 stars, but I know they try hard so we'll round up rather than down. My husband and I both ordered the creamy vegetarian ramen and it was really just so so. In the future I'd much rather just stay home and cook a pack of ramen for $1 and toss some veggies in. I read the website ahead of time and they make it sound like the chef has worked years to refine the art of ramen. Meh. It was noodles in soup. For what it's worth the broth was quite subtle with ginger flavors. I won't be back, but that's me. It wasn't bad at all, but it certainly didn't wow.</review>

We got the poke and the mini chashu don as starters and a bowl of tan tan men and spicy miso. We found the thinner noodles of the miso tastier. Overall great service and yummy food. Bonus, clean bathroom!</Text>

Great service and tasty, hot food fast.  The waitress explained the menu to me and I settled on the Tan Tan Men, which arrived quickly and was piping hot, flavourful, and quite spicy even at the "regular" setting. I was there at off-peak hours, so there were only about three other tables occupied. Total bill was under ten bucks and I understand that they make their own noodles with an emphasis on health. I'll be back!<//Text>

This quaint, traditionally decorated "treasure" is bursting with unstoppable flavor. Whether you are eating the Tan Tan Men or the Vegan Tan Tan Men, your taste buds will have an amazing dance party.

What surprised me on my first visit was how reasonable the price is. I would have paid more. This is one of my favorite go-to spots. Me, my husband and our 3 year old son go all the time. By the way...beautiful patio area< /Text>

Shoki has always been my favorite place for ramen in the Sacramento area. I've been coming to Shoki for many years and all throughout their numerous menu changes. While I can't say I've liked all the experiments they've done with the menu, I can say I've always enjoyed the broth of my go-to order: Kurogoma Tantan Men.

I typically order the Kurogoma Tantan Men (contains minced beef), but on my most recent visit I decided to try their newly added Vegetarian version of the item (Yasai Kurogoma Tantan Men).  I very much enjoyed this one as well!  Now I have something for when I feel like meat and something for when I want to go with veggies only. While the Kurogoma broth is not for everyone, I love the flavor of the black sesame seeds. They have many choices of ramen flavors, so if that doesn't sound appealing to you, give something else a try: shio (sea salt base), shoyu (soy sauce base), or curry (soy sauce base with curry sauce).

I know people who are partial to the less healthy ramen places, but I personally prefer the taste of the broth here compared to the numerous other ramen places that use MSG and unhealthy additives. I have always been in full support of the Owner's/Chef's passion for creating a healthier bowl of ramen, made from scratch and natural ingredients.

Even though they ignored my job application right when I graduated from high school, and I am reminded of that rejection every time I eat here to this very day, I return in spite of this because the ramen here is the best!< /Text>

I work downtown and eat here regularly. Great ramen and appetizers for the price. I highly recommend the spicy poke bowl and the spicy tonkotsu mayu ramen. I typically get the ramen with garlic paste and with two extra pieces of chashu pork. Fresh vegetables and a creamy spicy broth cooked to perfection. Wait staff have always been professional and attentive. Definitely one of the best ramen shops in the downtown historic area.< /text>

This place was very promising but they seriously phoned it in with this when it comes to the staff.  I literally got there a few minutes after opening (i had actually just left a tea house that serves ramen to specifically come to this place). The waiter, who turned out to be a manager, took everyone's order except mine then left.  After not returning for over 20 minutes (closer to 30) I left the establishment. Just as I was crossing the street, she comes out and takes 3 peoples orders who just walked in. I confronted her about it and she said that she had to ask a question about one of the dishes and it slowed her down, I told her she should know her menu as the manager and at the very least should have said something since she took everyone's order but mine, and i was very visible, she had given me a menu so its not like she missed me on accident.  I have no problem waiting but that was disrespectful.  If you're gonna be slowed down by that amount of time it's the least you can do to let your customers know what's going on so they don't feel ignored.  I heard the ramen's great here but being disrespected like that is a serious pet peeve of mine so I wont be finding out.  If you can't get the ramen to the customer, what does it matter how good it is...<//Review>

There is usually a long wait for dinner time, about 15-30min. Be sure to go ahead & look for the waitlist on a black board when you arrive. This place not that crowded during lunch time, though. My favorite menu in here is definitely the Tan Tan Men. So good! Aside from ramen they also serve poké. They have their own parking though there are not that many spots available.<//review>

< Review>
Shoki Ramen House offers up delicious, flavorful ramen. They have quite a few options and heat levels. I tried the extra spicy pork based ramen and was not disappointed. It offered a wide range of flavor with a good heat that was not overwhelming. I will definitely be back to try other options. I highly recommend trying this place if you enjoy ramen or noodles. Also a single bowl was very filling and satisfying. Very friendly staff that answered all my questions for my first visit.<//Review>

My first time eating here, and I have to say OMG awesome! Its vegan and gluten free options were perfect for me. A little small but worth it. I do hear they are relocating to a bigger place, so before u go make sure its still opened.< /text>

Location is small, food is great and the staff is very friendly and helpful with any questions you have or recommendations you may be looking for. The menu was easy to navigate and our group was served fairly quickly. The food was really good and unfortunately I forgot to take a picture as I was too busy devouring it. They have vegetarian options and asked if we wanted to split the bill beforehand (which is nice when someone remembers to do this, either the staff or the customers bc then it's not so confusing when you're ready to pay your check.) I'd definitely come back here again, the food was good and at a fair price. Once thing to mention, the place is small so most tables sit 2-4 people. Our group was of 7, which they do have a long table for that but just make sure you have some patience when trying to get seated, it's worth it imo :)<//Review>

We did not need to wait on a Saturday at 5:30pm, however it did start to get quite busy soonafter. The wait staff are friendly and attentive, which contributed to an additional star in my review. We ordered the Shio ramen and Kurogoma tantanmen, but I had only personally tried the Shio ramen, which I do not recommend. The dashi/broth tastes predominantly of katsuobushi (bonito) and really nothing much else; it is a light and very bland broth. Ironically there is not enough salt in the Shio (salt) ramen. The noodles are average, with a slightly more stiff chew. The boiled cabbage, which is unflavored, included a piece of the core which was unfortunate. I was disappointed that the egg is not the typical ramen egg with a golden runny yolk. This is a plain old boiled egg, which is cooked well but would be more suited for deviled eggs. The raw acrid spinach on top does not work well with ramen.  My significant other who had the kurogoma ramen commented that the minced beef topping was refrigerator cold. Their ramen fares significantly below average.<//Review>

Always a pleasure dining here! Great food in a cozy atmosphere, just a few blocks away from the Capitol and Downtown area. Service is ALWAYS amazing on every single visit with every single server! :) The best ramen around, with tender noodles and in delicious broths that doesn't overwhelm you. Portions are pretty generous and it's even good To-Go! All in all, a local gem that can't be beat for good food at a modest price. Totally worth the walk! :D<//text>

<Text>This is the best ramen in Sacramento and their yasai options (vegetarian/vegan) are incredible! It's so nice to have a ramen restaurant that offers vegan options so that everyone can get what they want. I go here at least once a week for lunch and often for dinner.</Text>< pictures>

Shoki is named Bowl of Dreams for a reason, excellent ramen! The broth and noodle and added toppings are excellent. The variety of drinks are excellent, the ambiance is relaxing. The servers are friendly and attentive. The reason for the three stars is the wait time, stemming from efficiency issues in the kitchen, translate to long wait to get seated and extended wait to cook the ramen. This dynamic arose since. the new owners landed. I'm all for addressing my own inefficiency and expect Shoki is doing there best to address this issue. It's especially difficult with families wanting to put their toddlers down at night and also wanting ramen 🙏<//review>

<Text>Solid ramen, with a variety of choices. Pretty much any option can be made vegetarian (or at least pescatarian). Is it the best ramen I’ve ever had? No. But is this my go-to spot when I’m craving ramen and friendly service here in Sac? Absolutely.< /Text>< Pics>

Some choices but nothing too authentic. They didn't have my favorite, tonkotsu ramen, I was disappointed. Also prices are a bit higher compared to the other places.< /Text>

<Text>Hands down my favorite local ramen spot. Their wide variety of msg free and healthy conscious broths, along with their even wider variety of toppings makes their ramen the most versatile and customizable I've ever seen - even for vegetarians! They have 100% vegetarian broths and tons of wonderful toppings. Gone are the days of boring meat free ramen. 💚<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

I'd give this place NO stars if i could. It was my very first time here so i asked for a suggestion, woman who took my order was very short and didn't explain what was in the dish. Rushed me through my order and when i asked to add an egg AFTER I paid, she said there was no way she could do that. Food was VERY DISAPPOINTING. No real veggies in the soup and instead of the beef slices it indicated on the menu, there was GROUND BEEF in the soup. I will NEVER go back to this place. I really was sad by how BAD the food was....< /text>

The ramen was bland, nothing I would eat twice. The egg was over cooked and bland as well. The minced meat was weird and fell to the bottom of the broth - it was grainy. Not impressed. Try somewhere else.</text>

Great food, they have several selections of soup base to choose from, noodles and tons of toppings. I highly recommend the tan tan man, which can be ordered as spicy as you want.<//text>

So of all the ramen places I've been to in sac, Shoki is one of my favorites. The ramen is delicious and perfectly priced, the servers are always nice and helpful. My problems are the past three times I've gone in, there were lots of flies and me and my date had to keep swatting at them to protect our food and the tables have been kind of sticky when I've gone in.<//review>

Decent ramen. Weird service got put under a ledge but we were to talk and our heads kept bumping it. Asked for water and the child who was serving us forced us to get box water because apparently "the water goes to the trees" after I asked for regular water they still brought box water.< /review>

<Rating>5<//Rating><text>My favorite place for ramen! Love that I can sit outside, love that parking is not an issue, and love the ramen! You can choose your noodle and broth, the servers are happy to assist you if your new to ramen. It doesn't matter what you decide, you will like it! Btw, this is not a good place for a group, it's very small and usually pretty busy. I would never go with a party of more than three.</text>< Pictures>

This is my go to for Ramen in Sacramento. I've waited up to an hour to eat here before, and I'd be willing to wait much longer than that for any of their bowls of soup</Review>

<Rating>1< /Rating><review>Didn't feel welcome.

Seeing all the good reviews, we were anxious to try out this ramen house.  Not knowing the hours, we apparently arrived a few minutes between closing for lunch service.  The open sign was still on.  The server said that they were closing in one minute.  I told her to turn off the sign first.  She did take our order, however, then brought us the check!  I have managed restaurants before, and never saw that one yet.  The food arrived 20 minutes later.  I was uncomfortable, and didn't have the slightest idea what was in my ramen.  Push, push, push and I paid with my credit card and the clueless server returned it to my partner.  Hapless rudeness at every turn.  Good grief, Sacramento, do you think this is a good restaurant?  Never return to this one!</review><pics>None</pics>< resp>

Chashu is sliced pork and "extra" gets you 2 for $2, but "double" gets you 8 for $4. Outside seating available with gas heaters.< /Review>< Response>

<Rating>5<//Rating><review>The meatless kurogoma tan tan is the best vegetarian (could be made vegan) ramen in Sacramento. Shoki created this hearty bowl of vegetarian ramen  without sacrificing the  traditional tastes. It's wonderful that this vegetarian option has the same thoughtfulness in it as the traditional bowls, instead of a side item for those who don't eat meat.<//review>< pics>

I got off the plane got into a rental and Google ramen.  I picked this place the cussed it was on the way down to or and to be stuff California and had good ratings. The place was crowded for its Sunday afternoon but there was plenty of parking. I asked the waitress what I should have as she recommended that Dan Dan ramen which was popular there.  I'm a say was so recommendation as the broth was excellent. Plus that only about $8 you could not go wrong.  I did add some spice garlic and toefl which made the total bill come up to about $11.50 and it was all worth it. Considering the value for money and the location this place is definitely a 5 star spot.  I will come back by when have I get a chance.</Review><Response>None< /Response>< username>

Good ramen at a fair price. They could definitely use an AC for the 100+ degree Sacramento days.<//Text>

My ramen was good but not great. Cheaper than ramen I've had in Socal and the Bay but they didn't even give me a poached egg. The meat was also okay but I've had better. Wouldn't recommend to a friend.</Text>

<Review>Go to lunch early so I can avoid crowds only to be ignored after I'm seated for 20-min while groups of people who came after me are seated, ordered and served. This place has good food but the service is disgusting. I left right after a negative Yelp review was written. As I was getting up the waiter finally comes over and I tell him don't bother, you took too long, I have to go, and I already left negative feedback. He got "pissy". Worst yet, eating downtown is the worst at lunch time so, no lunch for me.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmapID>

One if the best Raman houses in town. Besides a great selection of ramen, they have wonderful Takoyaki. In addition, the location is great, except the lack of parking (which is true of much of downtown). There are many restaurants and bars within walking distance and Shoki is open late.<//Text>

< review>
Shoki was my favorite ramen joint in Sacramento. That being said, the quality here has continually declined each year. At first I was happy to see all the new options on the menu for vegetarians, vegans, gluten intolerant, etc, but it seems that each time the menu is stretched wider, the quality goes lower and lower. Even the basics weren't done correctly (I don't remember ordering my noodles al dente to the point that the cross section is half uncooked). A marinated egg should be complimentary with a bowl of ramen, but even after paying extra for it, it was tough (old) and didn't have any flavor. Similar also to the cha shu which was thinly cut, dry, and had no flavor. The details weren't cared about as can be seen by cold meat on the tan tan men and the undercooked noodles. Also the service was quite bad. The restaurant was not even half full and there was a wait just to get a menu. If I wait to be seated then the menu should come quite quickly. Furthermore if I have ramen then I shouldn't need to ask for the condiments. Then after asking for them they didn't bring the chili oil which was why I asked in the first place.

Shoki used to be the best, back when they had fewer menu items all cooked perfectly but those days have ended it seems. I will miss you Shoki.<//review>

They're gluten free noodles are actually really good! It's nice to be able to bring my friends here who have allergies and those who are on a low carb diet. I always get extra spicy and it's never too overwhelming (I do eat spicy often so if you are not a regular spicy eater stick with regular)

I typically add bamboo and nori. The toppings aren't like super amazing but they aren't bad either. I highly recommended the spicy garlic edamame aswell 😍. They are fairly spicy good blend of both flavors served hot.< /text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Text>One of my favorite places to find vegetarian ramen. I live in San Francisco, and any time I am in Sacramento or headed to Lake Tahoe I make a point to stop here. Their black sesame tantan ramen is my favorite. A perfect amount of spice and super fresh ingredients with no MSG. I highly recommend to check this place out.<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None< /response>< gmapID>

Our favorite place to eat ramen noodles. The broth is what makes the soup so good and the add-ons give you the personal touch. Love the mushrooms and beef add-ons. We try to get here as often as possible, driving all the way from Rocklin to have Japanese comfort food. Highly recommend this restaurant.</text>

<Review>Hands down my favorite Ramen shop in the area. As a plus, a big difference from everywhere else is they are MSG free and have gluton free options, which is rare among Ramen shop. Even organic noodles, man! My favorite is the tan tan men. If you can ever make it while there's strawberry daifugu, get it. It's amazing and super popular. Other suggestion, try to get there early, as they are small and fill up quickly.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

<Text>This place is so structured!  Can't order when you want.  You have to wait to get your drink order then they'll come back to take your order.  Why can't they do everything at the same time?  They don't know how to make the boiled egg.  I complained that it was hard boiled and not soft boiled, yet I was still charged $2 for it.  Everything is a la carte.   Shoyu Ramen used to come with bamboo shoot, fish cake, spinach, 2 slices of pork, 1 seaweed and bean sprouts.   They did away with bamboo and fish cake.  They no longer offer fish cake and didn't replace it with anything.   Their turnover rate is high, so each time you go, you get a waiter/waitress who messes up somehow.  It used to be good a long time ago, not anymore.   Now they try to nickel and dime you for EVERYTHING!</Text>< Pics>

Not sure about other dishes but the Lamen is not the taste of Japan! Pay $10 for this "instant" noodles? Really?

If the reviewers give out 4.5 starts, you sure don't know the taste of Real Japanese Lamen!

NEW RESTAURANT LOCATION. ACCEPTS CREDIT CARDS!

Tantan ramen is always my favorite. You can adjust the spicy level accordingly. They always warn you that they can't fix it if it's too spicy, so use discretion.

Crowded on most days, but this location has the best deal. More space, Less of a wait time AND they accept credit cards. WIN.< /text>

<review>Delicious ramen made with local ingredients, including a grass-fed beef addition if desired. There are 4 different noodles to choose from: thick, thin, whole wheat and yam. All are delectable and freshly prepared by a nearby company. There are vegan ramen options available with none of the flavor compromised. At the end of a meal for people that can stomach dairy, a black sesame icecream is hugely recommended...also locally made. The employees are extremely knowledgeable and are willing to answer any questions you may have. Once you try this place you'll wish you'd done it sooner!!< /review><username>Frances L</username>< Resp>

<Review>Feels like an authentic Japanese ramen house. (And scored accordingly.) MY FAVORITE PLACE TO EAT HANDS DOWN. No other place has ramen that can compare.

And their eggs are the best. It's worth the dollar.</Review><gmap_id>0x809ad126d6879097:0x1e9f6dba6a88b67e<//gmap_id><Resp>None< /Resp></record></dataset><record>

< review>
For ramen in Sacramento, it's Shoki all the way. Rich, flavorful broth. Perfect medium boiled egg. Amazing chasu. Spicy heat to taste. Definitely worth a little bit of a wait and cramped space. The only place that might beat it that I've tried is Ramen Dojo in San Mateo, but that would be close...</review>

<Review>Great little ramen place on R Street in downtown Sacramento. The place is cozy (read: small) but the wait was pretty short given the chilly weather and eager patrons. The food is great, and I was happy that I went for the curry broth ramen. The portions are pretty big, and my order tied me over well over into the next day. Our sides of lightly seasoned chashu pork as well as the edamame we all delicious. High marks for both the food and the service. Highly recommended.</Review><Gmap_id>0x809ad126d6879097:0x1e9f6dba6a88b67e</Gmap_id><pics>None<//pics>< UserId.>

This is a tiny ramen stand and once you're inside it's like a diner/ramen bar atmosphere.

The bathroom is accessible via outside and through a key, maybe telling more about the sketchiness of the area.

I thought the ramen was just okay. I ordered a tonkotsu and it wasn't very flavorful. I ordered corn and they bowl was literally half corn. So I guess the ramen is pretty much however you choose to customize it. But the tonkotsu broth lacked a lot of flavor and my pork portions were small and not very good.

Maybe I'll try the soy milk or something special if I decide to come here again.< /Review>< pics>

Ramen was ok but the service was frustratingly slow.  There is better ramen with better service in Sacramento.</Review>

Disappointed. Usually solid food, but this time very slow service, food not quite up to its usual par, and prices have been in flux. Hope they get back to quality of the past...< /review>

<Time>1382057130562< /Time><Review>I'm no ramen connoisseur, but I highly enjoy my culinary experience every time I'm here. The ramen is simple and hearty, with a variety of options to add plenty of toppings (will run up the price quickly though). The Shio and Soy based ramen are both excellent and the atmosphere has that lively, bustling feel to it. Great place to relax with delicious ramen with sake!</Review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None< /resp><user_name>Erick Yu</user_name>< GmapID>

<Text>This is by far the best ramen place in Sacramento.  In fact, I'm confident enough to say that it's one of the top 5 ramen stores in all of California.  I've been to most of the best ramen stores in Los Angeles, the Peninsula, and San Francisco.  A few important tips.  Always get their tamago (boiled egg) with your ramen.  They cook it to perfection, and it has this delicate soy sauce flavor infused in them that makes them delicious and the star of the ramen bowl.  Their broth is deep, complex, but not overwhelmingly heavy.  It's actually pretty light.  Everything about their ramen bowl shows these guys really know what they're doing.  I would even go to this place if it was in Japan!  If you go there in the summer, also try their tomato ramen!<//Text>< gmap_id>

< Review>
Shoki is the Best place for Authentic ramen Noodles in the whole sacramento area and japanese style curry as well.
The soups are very balance and taste amazing each with its unque flavor. The best part is they are healthy and organic! Please come try this place out you can't be dissapointed.<//Review>
