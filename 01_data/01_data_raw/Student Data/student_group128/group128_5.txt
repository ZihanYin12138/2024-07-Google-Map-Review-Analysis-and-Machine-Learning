<text>I have been here for and gotten good service once before so I thought I would go back and found a great place. Sat down and Got a haircut with Jimmy. Couldn't tell if he was high or drunk with how slow he was moving. Sat their for ten minutes while he did a bunch of stuff before he even started cutting. He cut my ear twice with the buzzer and was being creepy the whole time. Talking to himself, talking weird about girls, whistling at them out the window. It was extremely odd and it has to make people uncomfortable. Not sure if he's on the spectrum or something maybe but I wont be going back. I hope people have better experiences with other barbers but not chancing it.</text><pictures>None</pictures>< rate>

I thanked your barber, and I like it because it fits my serious personality. The service price was very nice to the wallet as well. Many thanks to you for your kindness, guys! You certainly deserve to be recommended highly!<//Text>

Decent haircut at best. First time in San Diego from NY, so you know this was disappointing from the start. I paid $40....for that I’d get two cuts in NY and they would be the best fades possible.
Definitely a one time visit, currently looking to try any other shop around LOL<//review>

Great haircut.  My barber took a good, long time to make sure he got the fade just right.  Best haircut I’ve had in years.<//Text>

Best barbershop this side of the 5! Anthony is always on point and takes the extra few minutes to ensure you're lined up just right before leaving. It's also nice to having him remember how the cut goes and not having to explain it every time. If you're in need of a good shop, this is it, Anthony being my go to...< /Review>

<Review>Unprofessional business. Scheduled a 10am appointment, place is supposed to open at 10am. No one was at the business by 10:10 when I was informed by others waiting outside that it could be a long while before the shop is open. Not sure if they’re good at cutting hair, because the business admin side of the house is not functioning.< /Review>< user_name>

Would never return kept waiting in the chair whilst the lad took a personal phone call ....10 mins later comes back still on the phone and proceeds to give me one of the worst cuts I have ever had whilst arguing with his GF....got home found loads of hairs missed and longer than others ...careless uncaring and for $25 a real rip off.  Avoid ....much better barbers near by - believe me I don't normally write negative reviews!!!</Text>< pics>

<review>This guy literally just butchered the s*** out of my hair. Asked for a medium high skin fade and he basically shaved my head. Hardly any fade. Told him to go to 1.5  for the top on my sides and he took it down to a 0.5... Also $25, so not worth it.... save your time and money.< /review><user>108567929703214572974< /user><Response>None<//Response></record>

<review>We had our entire backyard of awful half-dead Bermuda grass dug up and replaced with turf. We went with the cement curb edging which was pricey, but worth it in the long run. There were a few rain delays and another project that held ours up a bit, but the crew was great about being communicative and prompt to get the job done well and quickly regardless. We LOVE our new yard and have never spent so much time in it. Thanks all for the hard work and awesome results!</review>< resp>

<review>Cale showed up on time with great ideas to redesign our back yard with turf, walkway, stairs and borders. We had other quotes, but Home Turf beat them. Martin and his crew started the job on time and was there to work hard in 100° weather. I requested Martin could do a complex design for the walkway and he didn't hesitate doing it and the job came out fantastic.  I would highly recommend Home Turf do your project.<//review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPbm3r447pWNqNbNzO_aUpw1zERRtjr_m0rhvpN=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPPWs4Vhbdo2JJVOoTXRd3XmGdOIlSZg7HU6_2Q=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNmzJ84XyrLBvk8P4Zo4nNf5WYdAAk5WiOkb-Sb=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOWaF-82YNguxtksuxlMu9XGjTNm7EKMuFa3RaR=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMgQ-o2CLy8kPMt_23sLNcRMWj6dMvUxnaSfSwK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNg8UgMfIRwUivn_R9xpzZOUDGufhkAxL01aVKA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics><response>{'time': 1610059463900, 'text': 'Thank you Susan for your kind words.

<Text>Home Turf installed artificial turf and a beautiful block planter wall at our home. Cale Abramson was our sales associate who showed up at the designated time and was very forthright and helpful in completing our project. The install crew were very professional and did everything possible to complete the job to our satisfaction. And they did it on time as scheduled. George was the crew leader and was very personable whose main objective was to produce a quality job. We’ve had many compliments from neighbors and I would not hesitate to recommend this company. Thanks Home Turf and crew!!< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

The whole HomeTurf team did a great job. Cale recommended a brick border to go with my existing landscape, looks fantastic. Martin and his team knocked out the whole project in one day. Took care of little details and did a great job cleaning up at the end of the day. Very pleased with the results. I have had many neighbors stop by to give us compliments on our new turf.</Text>

Cale and the Home Turf team was awesome! Knocked the job out in one day. Agreed to the project and put deposit on Monday job was done that Friday. Best warranty and price I could find after numerous bids. Cale was quick to return texts and answered all questions. Thanks so much for making it such a easy process!<//text>

Trust me, don’t waste your time with other flaky contractors who try to price gouge you, or don’t even respond back to you.

We replaced our lawn grass with Artificial Turf for a couple of reasons. The maintenance and cost of water in Solana Beach keep increasing. I interviewed a couple of San Diego “high positive” reviewed companies and went with Home Turf. Our contact from beginning to end was Cale Abramson. Cale was easy to work with, very knowledgeable about his product and installation. I knew we had weeds in the existing lawn.  Cale made it clear from the beginning, he would have to eradicate the Nut Grass before completing the installation. It was a longer process than he and I imagined yet he never backed down on insisting the Nut Grass had to go. I practiced patience, Cale was right and we now have two beautiful turf areas including a putting green. In this year of Covid and bigger life issues we found something good could happen.  I would not hesitate to recommend Home Turf and the installation team led by Cale.< /review>

I’m so happy with the work done by Cale and his crew at Hometurf! I found the company based on positive reviews on Nextdoor and after interviewing four different options, I decided to go with Hometurf. We had a great first time meeting with Cale being communicative, responsive, and on-time for our meeting. He heard our desires, and he then proceeded to measure out our yard and direct us toward a product and design that fit our needs. We scheduled the job to be completed right before winter break. We basically removed all our dead grass (about 1600 sq.ft,) created a mow curb concrete border, added a 350 sq.ft. putting green, and turfed in the rest of our yard. We had to remove tree roots and fix irrigation and gas lines. It was done professionally and to our satisfaction. I would highly recommend Hometurf to my friends, and I am so happy with our new yard!<//Review>

Home Turf just installed artificial turf on my front lawn.  Cale was great to work with and clearly defined our options.  His crew were very hard workers, and kept the work area clean while the project was done.  We couldn't be happier with the result.< /Text>

<Text>I highly recommend using “HomeTurf“ if your looking for good quality Turf. Steve (The Owner) provided me with exceptional customer service which made it easy for me to pick this company. I simply explained to Steve what I was looking for and he provided me with different options to fit my needs and budget. On the day of the install, George (Crew Leader) was punctual and explained to me step by step what was being done and kept me in the loop. All of the installers where very professional, friendly and hard workers. My family and I could not be happier with our new Turf. Thank you HomeTurf.</Text><user_name>Martin Moreno< /user_name><UserId.>105575850923780431199< /UserId.>< gmapID>

<Review>Cale and Kris know their stuff. I have worked in real estate for 13 years and I have seen a lot of bad turf jobs. To start Home Turf Artificial Grass offer the best quality turf on the market. Next their installers now have done two projects for me and both of them were done in a timely manner and came out looking amazing. In both situations on my home and commercial project they helped design each area and create a clear picture that matched what we were looking for. All I can say is I would use them again and I will be doing my backyard down the road.</Review><gmap_id>0x80d9570567eb525d:0x87b14d5b1b44c6ae</gmap_id>< Pictures>

<text>We got several estimates, looked at several samples, but when Cale from Home Turf showed us his stuff and his best-by-far warranty, it was so easy to say yes, especially when his price was also close to the rest! George and his crew did a good job putting it all in after a couple of agreed alterations. After a couple of months now, we keep comparing to other houses we see with artificial turf, and so far nothing has come close to our turf. We made the right choice!< /text>< user_name>

From start to finish Cale was there to guide and give honest advice. He helped get more than I had first imagined with our project. We received 3 other quotes and Cale was the only one who brought up design help. The price was in line with other quotes but Cale sealed the deal. On install Marteen was excellent and so was his crew! Couldn’t have asked for a better overall experience.< /text>

The yard is based on curves, not square corners, and they needed to blend in with existing concrete for both color and shape.  They designed out the yard with our inputs, and built it out exactly like they described.  The detail and craftsmanship was outstanding. The price was 5k less than a competitors bid, and the their offer had more detail and product than the competitors product to boot.</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

We worked with Cale Abramson who was great! He came out and helped us design a perfect space for us and our dogs, answering all our questions, giving us advice and making recommendations about things we hadn't even thought about.  His crew was very professional, showed up on time, cleaned up after themselves, and everything was completed in 2 days.  We definitely recommend, and would use them again should we ever move.</Text>

<Text>It’s been about 2 months since Hometurf completed our “yard project”. The crew was polite, obviously knowledgeable (there is a technical component to installation that quite impressive), obviously had worked together for a long time. Actually seemed to enjoy doing the work. The finished product was truly transformational. The true test, to write this review, was to see what would happen with rain (a lot of it so far), dogs running and doing what they do, along with daily life wear and tear. Looking out over the yard is a daily joy. Side benefit - the pool stays cleaner!!! Thanks HomeTurf from sales to operations. Totally exceeded expectations.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

Backyard looks amazing! Chose this company after looking at a neighbors backyard done by Hometurf and getting a bid that was very competitive over the 5 previous bids I had gotten. Cale’s ideas were right on. He was very patient with my numerous questions, explaining everything fully. His installation was quick and complete. Great to work with Martin, also.< /Text>

Kris and Cale were great, showed up on time for estimate and helped with overall design and needs.  Scheduling was fast and easy, and project started and completed on time.  Willie and his crew were also great. They took their time, paid a lot of attention details, to ensure the job was completed properly.  Turf looks great!

The staff was wonderful and honest with helping us choose the type of turf we wanted! The owner himself is very reasonable and their prices are great!!! We were able to purchase the amount we needed (and more) including all the materials needed to do the job! They also did an excellent job explaining to us on how to do the project ourselves and even provided us a handout on the steps to do so! Really great company! Really great prices! Really great staff!

The team then came to install the turf.   They were friendly.   Willie was wonderful and made sure we received everything as per put quote.
They all worked together very well and knew exactly what needed to be done.

HomeTurf just installed artificial grass that looks great.  Cale provided information and knowledge on what turf would meet our needs (grandchildren and occasional dog).  This narrowed our selection of the many artificial turfs to a few.
HomeTurf's installation crew were super.  They were friendly, profession, neat and worked hard.
We would recommend HomeTurf for artificial turf.</text>

We had a great experience working with Cale, Aron, and their crew. Everyone was professional and courteous. We had 3 companies out for estimates and although HomeTurf was a little more expensive, still reasonable, we could tell we we would get what we pay for . Cale answered all our questions before we asked and offered additional information we didn't think of. We are extremely satisfied with our results and the experience of working with this team. Highly recommend HomeTurf.</text>

<review>I called a few places for artificial turf in San Diego. Mikel took my call and provided some great info an promptly emailed a quote with a few options at various prices. When I went in the store, the guys were super friendly and knowledgeable - it was professional from start to finish. They got me some great options and offered to deliver for a small fee. Would absolutely recommend them for anyone looking for turf!<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Rate>

Home Turf installed turf for a small area in our backyard. The process was easy and painless. The price was reasonable compared to other companies of this caliber. Grass was installed in 1 day and workers cleaned up thoroughly. The turf looks like healthy grass and we're getting more use out of the area as the kids enjoy playing on it.<//review>

I used HomeTurf Synthetic Grass when we bought our home to install our solar for the home and our pool.  The salesman was very friendly and made sure to follow up on the project from start to end.  The solar crew were professional and down to earth.  HomeTurf recommended pet turf, however at the time, we did not need turf since our backyard still had grass in it.

Since our solar install our grass has died and we have 3 dogs that are constantly playing, running, and dogs doing their business.  I knew HomeTurf installed turf, so I called and spoke with Cale and set up an appointment to get an estimate on the install.

Cale Came to our house and discussed options for pet turf, installation times and length of the installation.  Cale was professional, well spoken and on time for our appointment.  We chose our pet turf that was recommended to best serve us and our pets.  We got a bid for our HomeTurf install and have decided to install our turf in Spring of 2018.

I am SO EXCITED and we are looking forward to the facelift of our backyard.    The experience with HomeTurf so far has been great.< /Review>< Pictures>

<review>On behalf of the Santee Firefighters Association I would like to leave a great review about Home Turf and Kris. Kris made a generous donation of turf to improve our search and rescue dog Victor’s kennel. This was a kind move for him and his company to do. Great product that suits our needs well!

I previously wrote a review on how happy I am with this company's work and service. I wanted to write this because some companies do the work and never come back when a problem arises later in time.
I had a small problem with the perimeter of the beautiful grass in the front part of my garden and of course I called home Home Turf  ( Caleb Abramson ) to honor the warranty and fix it.
Well.....  Cale sent his team to fix it within less than a week!!  AMAZING!!
Furthermore they even checked and performed minor detailing on  the whole job without me asking!!
Home Turf has surpassed my expectations doing the original work AND answering a service call long after the installation!!!   Talk about excellent POST installation SERVICE!!!
Once again I recommend Home Turf and Cale for the installation and WARRANTY of beautiful turf .< /Text>

<review>Had two estimates done for artificial turf for our front yard.  Cale was first and, frankly, I like the "grass" that he had better than the 2nd estimate from a company I had used before.  Was told the job would take 2-3 days and it took 3.  The only reason it took 3 was because the bobcat to be used had broken down and was not available.  The job looks fantastic, more importantly, my wife loves it.  Willie and crew did a fantastic job.</review><gmap_id>0x80d9570567eb525d:0x87b14d5b1b44c6ae</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

The representative we worked with was Andrea and she helped us throughout the process in a very professional and expedited manner. The plan that we wanted was both Turf and hardscape work and Hometurf delivered. The construction team did quick and above and beyond work that my family and I are extremely satisfied with. Our home looks better than expected so I would definitely recommend this team as they did such great work.</Text>

<user>101166774688878367746<//user><review>We had Home Turf replace 2100 square feet of grass with artificial turf in Feb. 2015 as well as redo our landscaping and irrigation system in our front and back yard. The work was done very well and in a timely manner. Cale was very professional and  also was very responsive to sending them back to tweek a couple of small redos several months later. It has been over 2 1/2 years now and the landscaping and artificial lawns continue to look great. We were so pleased that we had this company replace grandma's front and back lawns last year and she  continues to be happy with the nice looking results.  Good quality product.< /review>< Rate>

Where do I begin

BUYER BEWARE, this place will promise you the world, but the reality is this is a fly by night place, poorly run and possibly the most dishonest company I have ever worked with. We got the sales rep JUSTIN. Nice guy, made lots of promises, and very few were kept. He promised over and over again about how fast they are, how fast they take care of warranty issues, and lastly how professional they are.

On installation day, I was not sure if it was the grass installation people or a prison work day. The crew was ROUGH to say the least. After they all smoked their packs of cigarettes in my front yard and finished off some energy drinks they got to work. Close your windows if you are not into foul language. I caught the entire crew asleep in their trucks on multiple occasions. The crew leader AARON was not even on the job site 80% of the time. Upon completion, they did not wait for me to inspect or sign off. Upon inspection, there were areas that were not even tacked down, loose corners, mis cuts, and areas where the grass was not even straight. I began calling the office. After 6 days, 9 phone calls, and 7 messages left.....still no return call. Called for the 10th time and got a live person....was told they just fired the whole office staff. They would send out a MANAGER GARY. Gary showed up as scheduled. Gary said the job was done poorly to say the least and would get AARON back out within the next week. Well that was 2 months ago. Gary has not followed up at all. We have called the sales rep Justin countless times, he says he spoke to the owner and the owner does not think there is a problem. Gary has a whole roll of pictures on his phone from my house. This place is very poorly run, revolving staff, dishonesty is standard practice. They keep pushing you onto other people and deny deny deny. DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY  LOOK AT YELP< /text>< Pictures>

Love the delicious and fresh Kabobs served at this dog friendly restaurant by sea. Great clam chowder and a wide selection of beers too!

Sadly, this great location closed as of September 2018. There is still Dockside and Dockside Too (which is pet friendly), but Dockside 3 will be greatly missed!<//review>

<text>Ordered the 2 piece fish and chips as well as a small cup of chowder.  Was expecting the fish to be deep fried but instead it was served grilled. Pleasantly surprised, the seasoning and taste was great!. Fish was nice and moist, not dried out.  Will definitely go back for the grilled fish and chips.< /text>< pics>

In vacation to Morro Bay. We enjoy parking at our hotel and walking everywhere. We love this place because it's walking distance from hotel and we can chill next to water enjoying the views. The atmosphere is great if you like casual,chill and authentic.< /text>

I saw many repeat local customers. So I decided to give a try. Good oyster garlic butter. Next to the shore and nice breeze. Be patient to find a parking.<//Review>

Great little place for some smoked fish and a beer.  They have a large selection of beers on tap and smoke their own fish and scollops.  They also have fresh oysters, we got a half dozen swimming in butter and some scollops on a kabob, pictured below. With a couple of cold beers it was a wonderful treat.  We sat outside they do have a few outside seats.  Not really a big place but nice.< /text>

<text>We have eaten here many times and always enjoyed the food. However last night, after checking the website (which said they closed at 7:00 in one place and in another place said 8:00, in winter), we arrived before 6:30 and were told, “we are closed!” The door was open, the fire was burning outside, and people were visiting inside. No explanation or apology, just no service!! Very rude way to treat former customers.</text>< Pics>

The chowder was thick as concrete, the fish and rice as well as the seafood pasta gave my friends cramps. The captains platter and fish&chips was ok, given it was deep fried that's no wonder.
No real taste in any of the dishes.
No real water was served, I had to drink the chlorine waste.

At least the service took the chowders off the bill.<//text><username>Konrad Lauten< /username><Rate>1<//Rate><user_id>111627309853500309280</user_id></record></dataset><record>

I ordered the 2 piece Fsh & Chips.  Pricy for what they give you.  2 very SMALL pieces of fish and mostly fries for $11.00.  I wouldn't order again!  Dockside is charging TOO much for this!  I am a driver for Uber & Lyft.  My riders will ask about good food places.   I would NOT recommend the F & C at Dockside.<//Review>

This is my favorite coffee shop to visit. Freshly roasted coffee they can make with their own homemade coconut milk if you want. They have lovely staff, very friendly and helpful. You can get non-coffee drinks too. I love the place so much! Perfect!</Review>

This Duncan location it's in the heart of the campus Shopping Center or you have Trader Joe's and some other fast food restaurants like in and out, it does not have drive-thru but there's a couple of 10 minutes parking spots that you can use quickly to go and pick up your phone order, when they went there last there were a couple of tables outside that you could still use to sit down and drink your coffee even during Covid times</text>

At first since Covid this location was vey unfriendly, but since the corporate replaced the staff they are so friendly and welcoming!! They go extra mile to make sure you are happy and satisfied! This DD has a back patio with a fireplace for students, and entrepreneurs to work and study!! I love this DD in Irvine I would recommend  you visit especially after Covid 🥰</Review>

My coffee was supposed to be hot but was "warm" at best. The cup had a funny smell and it honestly just did not taste that good. I think they are overrated.<//Review>

<text>Stopped in to grab a coffee when I went to pick up my Amazon package from next door. Inside is very clean and the employees were quick and friendly. Coffee is hot and fresh as is the donuts and bagels. Can be busy at times as expected due to it being located near a college campus. Would for sure recommend to family and friends.< /text>< pictures>

It was better than other branches in Orange County, however, the coffee was little bit watery. Donuts and service are great.< /Text>

<review>Such nice and friendly staff here. I don't come here too often but when I do the service is always nice and the food is always good. Parking can be a little tough sometimes, but it's expected. I enjoy their coffee the most.<//review>< pics>

Believe it or not I have never been to a DD. I had no intention of stepping into this one but it was right next to the Amazon return store and I had a gift card so I figured why not. Their coffee gets good reviews so I thought I'd try it along with its partner the glazed donut. My wife thought the coffee was good and plenty strong. I ordered the cold brew energy coffee with vanilla and cream. Excellent! We're not big donut eaters but we thought the donut was fresh and tasty. The store itself was modern and the menu options were extensive for both coffee drinks and donuts. The cleanliness of the store was very good. Definitely a go to.< /review>

<Name>Benjamin Esquivel< /Name><Time>1561698021301</Time><rating>4< /rating><Text>I came in to buy a dozen order of donuts, however, I was greatly disappointed about the lack of donut choices.

Maybe it was because it was a Sunday, but I came in at 3pm and found that only the left side of the glass had donuts, while the right side was completely empty!

Nevertheless, the donuts are good and I enjoy the taste. But I always get disappointed by the lack of donut choices.< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None</Resp><gmap_id>0x80dcdf45e01f3a77:0x7ce200be69e65671<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
I decided to go to a DD after a recent news article that they don't insult conservatives. I chose this UCI location due to my appt at the university. Staff were very friendly & helpful. Coffee & donut was good quality & equal to Starbucks, but at a lesser price. I didn't try their breakfast combo. Perhaps next time. I view DD as an alternative to Starbucks, but also McDonald's & other fast food.< /Review>

< Review>
Tried this place twice. Each time ignored. First time I still waited with rude service and ordered. Second time I tried to wait with no greeting. Even though the guy with semi curly hair looked at me multiple times before he turned his back to do something else. So I decided to take my money elsewhere and will never return here, probably never gonna go to another DD again.<//Review>

If you want coffee on a Saturday night get there at 9:40pm or earlier. They don’t really close at 10pm. The doors were locked when I got there. Ended up finding a Starbucks nearby that was actually open.</Review>

<Review>I have not had anyone at this location ask me for how many creams or sugar I wanted in my drinks, which seems unusual as most Dunkin locations in the NorthEast have the normal set to 3 creams/3 sugars. Here they will default you to no cream or sugar.

If you would like a straw, city of Irvine requires you to ask an employee for one. They will serve your drink without one to try to minimize plastic waste.

Overall a clean location with an outdoor roof covered patio  area to study or hang out.< /Review>< time>

<review>Cool little place, very busy of course.  Great price for what you get.  I got the summer splash tea which I ordered half sweet but I still find to be very very sugary.  Very fast service and very polite staff.<//review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPr1guw5qId_u5KkcklpAfR9wHoIypWtxT9_oxZ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM5a4fTormG1kcp3iECHxWScLlEc_NclsUIn_Tc=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures>< Response>

<Name>TiinaaLy</Name><Text>A cute little place with pretty lighting and fancy looking furniture. The tables lit up and even the walls were pretty! The service was great and fast. The staffs were really friendly. The taiyaki ice cream was delicious and the fish was fresh, warm, and crispy. The boba drink was also delicious. We got the Strawberry flavored ice cream/Nutella filling/oreo topping, Mango ice cream/Whipped cream filling, coffee ice cream/Red beans filling/ injeolmi topping, and a #1 House Special Boba drink.</Text></record></dataset><record>

This place used to be the spot after a day of work. Then it became a place where I first took interest in unique twists on your conventional boba drinks. From the Lee's Okinawa (reg. Okinawa BMT with a hint of wintergreen) to the ever refreshing "Oh My Stars" & can't forget the dreamy, creamy "XOXO". Im 4rm outta town, but way back when this place was "Sno-crave" (I still got 1 of those punch cards somewhere lol) I always went out of my way to come here. It's sad to see a hollow shell of what once was, knowing deep down it will never become. this place holds a special place in my heart and even though I didn't get one last Lee's Okinawa I will still throw up them 5 stars. Sad 2 see u go, now where am I supposed to get my brick toast???< /Review>

Really tasty tea! And my friend ordered a smoothy, and she got a second cup almost completely full with the leftover smoothie that was still in the blender! Super nice staff, and a nice place to sit and study, or socialize with friends.</Review>

The best boba in Sacramento, hands down! It is impossible to run out of new flavor combinations to try. However, there is not a lot of seating when it is busy and the music can be very loud at times.< /Review>

<text>I don't agree that the milk tea is top notch. It tastes like a powder medicine when kids get cold. Sencha in the USA or Gongcha in Asian countries are far better.<//text>< Pictures>

< Review>
Good quality milke tea. Coconut budding is delicious but have to go there early to buy it since it can be sold put fast. I tried their brick toasts and they tasted great. I'd recommend bringing one to three friends to share if you are going to order one brick toast. The store closed down due to COVID19.< /Review>

<rating>3</rating><Text>Didn't like this place. They got my order wrong twice; first the seal was broken, drink spilled everywhere, then they forgot to put sugar into my drink and the boba was really hard to chew. I would not recommend drinking the boba drinks. The table was very dirty and the employees was unfriendly. I know it was a slow day but they gave little to no attention to their customers. The old teahouse next door is so much better.<//Text>< Pics>

The Cant Elope and Oh My Stars were both very good. Boba was a good texture.  Fruit tea drinks tend to be very sweet, so be wary!<//Review>

Ordered through ubereats. The burgers were amazing and tasted fresh off the grill! The chicken teriyaki was also good and good portion of rice, veggies and meat. The blended thai iced tea was good, a little too sweet for me but was good nonetheless. Maybe you can request it to be less sweet. The boba was nice and soft. Will definitely be back!<//Text>

Odds are you'll find a flavor or two that you love. Hours are a little weird on the weekend, so check ahead of that's when you're visiting.< /text>< pics>

Interesting sticks, tried the steak, breaded chicken and grilled chicken.  Lots of sauces to choose from, nice to have decent vegetables for a change.

Went during lunch.  Only reason I didn't give it five stars was the wait.  I imagine that having so many different selections draws out the prep time, so it gets worse the more crowded it is.

Other than that, great place for a good lunch.<//Review>

The only reason I gave them a four-star was because they took a while to fix my food Grant it it's made to order and there were a couple people ahead of me but it still took a while. Everything I ordered was great I ordered the two meat combo with two sides and a drink and a side of corn fritters. The crispy chicken was really good crunchy on the outside juicy on the inside had a really good flavor I had the shrimp with that and it was really good although you only get for shrimp I wish they'd give you more I'm not a big coleslaw fan so I didn't eat it and I got the steam vegetables that could have used a little more cooking cuz they were a little hard but the corn fritters were to die for and it comes with a maple syrup dipping sauce. I love the fact that they give you so many dipping sauce choices you serve yourself they give you to cups to put them in but I'm sure you could get more this was my first time there and I will definitely go back.< /Text>

Food was great, Sauces amazing. I had a dark green salad, (citrus dressing is great), their coleslaw is light & excellent, I had chicken & veggie stick, grilled veggies were the best. I liked the sweet chili sauce as well as carrot ginger, but Citrus is my fave. Very clean. Only downside is that restroom is in next door restaurant (Vinny's).< /Text>

Absolute best lunch or dinner spot in the South Bay. You can EASILY eat very healthy or indulge in the chicken and waffles. Nothing better than as much meat as you can eat, dipping sauce, and some good ole fries.<//Text>

<Text>Recently I've been coming to Stix and Straws for their delicious burgers. I don't get any of their stix anymore.

I always get the Mushroom and Swiss Burger with Turkey.  I also add avocado and bacon to it.  They give you the option of getting it on white bread or wheat bread.

GET the WHITE BREAD!  It's much better here.  The bread kind of reminds me of the Kings Hawaiian sweet bread.

Also, if you're coming here, do yourself a favor and call in your order.  It usually takes about ten to fifteen minutes for them to make your burger.  If it's busy, maybe longer.  Especially if you're ordering when you get there.

Also, if you're dining in, I would recommend sitting outside because it gets super smokey in there.

Stix and Straws has the best burger in the south bay in my opinion.  My only suggestion is for them to double check the order before giving it to the customer.

I've had several times when I'd get the burger and there would be no bacon or avocado in it and the receipt shows as me getting it.

Other times, I would specify that I wanted a turkey burger, but I would get a beef patty instead.  Normally this would be fine, but I don't eat beef so I can't just eat it.

That's about it.  I would recommend Stix and Straws.<//Text>< pictures>

<Review>Pretty much the best healthful meal option anywhere in the South Bay. Grilled meats or Tofu - up to you what kind of sauce you douse them in - with brown rice and very nicely steamed, fresh vegetables. As to that sauce, their peanut satay sauce is amyahzing (see SNL sketch 'The Californians' if I just lost you).

The turkey burger w/ chili sauce is also nicely done, and sizeable, even on the thin bread.</Review><date>1360813734723</date><resp>None< /resp>< user>

<time>1442285213504</time><Rating>5</Rating><Text>Awesome place!  What's not to like?  Sandwiches, burgers and of course, the stix... We had the 3-stick combo: grilled steak, shrimp & crispy fish. Aaand... then U cn choose from 15 different sauces.  Dee-lish!

Then, to top it off, U can get smoothies, teas, boba, even 4 kinds of lemonade. (I had the Nutty Monkey... Waaay good!)

Definitely takes more than one visit!  '; ^ )<//Text>< pics>

I went for a SMOG test. It is first come, first serve. I get that. 3 oil changes ahead of me, waited an hour, and gave up with 2 more oil changes ahead of me... Don't know how good they were or not, as I had other things to do.<//Review>

Clean. Quick. Professional and friendly service.
They also caught some issues i had overlooked - dirty air filter, and that mice had been nibbling some engine wiring.
Very satisfied with my visit there.<//text>

I went in for a smog check on a Saturday afternoon. They were fast, very polite, told me it would take about 10 minutes for them to do the check.  Sure enough ten minutes they were done and out the door I was.  I would highly recommend any one to go here for their car needs.<//text>

< review>
I brought my car here Nov.2017 then a couple of months later an oil in my garage. Then I took it back and they said, maybe the people that did the last oil change strip the screw on your oil pan. And I told him that they were the last ones to change the oil on a vehicle.
So now I'm going to have to get me a new oil pan and the oil pan gasket and have the labor done out of my own pocket. This happened 3-12-18.< /review>

<resp>None</resp><Text>Great customer service even at the end of the day. These guys enjoy what they do and the customers can tell. They did what was needed and didn't try to sell us on anything else that needed to be done, unlike most mechanics when you bring in your car for something as simple as an oil change. Thank you guys for taking care of my mom's car! And keep the Island music bumpin!</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< name>

Great staff at this location! Fast and Friendly service. Staff was honest and not just trying to make a few extra dollars off of me. Came in for an oil change and transmisson fluid swap and they found my transmission was leaking and said the fluid swap shouldnt be done until i get the leak fixed. Keep up the good work!<//text>

<Name>Beverly Hitchens</Name><Date>1520131118178</Date><Review>This shop was extremely recommended to me by my family and I cant even begin to understand why. The first time I called looking for oil change prices and availability for an oil change, I could barely hear the man on the phone because must have had there lobby television volume up to the max. I was disappointed but called back the next day and I still had the exact same experience. Again, their was an ear piercing sound on there end. At this point I'm wondering if they are sponsoring a music fest 24/7. They must not want people to call them. If they do not have the professionalism to want to talk to you over the phone, I'm surely NOT going to entrust them to work on my cars. Fortunately, I did end up calling another shop that did want my business and without having to hear any blaring background sounds.<//Review><user>101852381364697058647</user><GmapID>0x80db27ef564a722f:0x91e5b62ee85dcc1a</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Highly recommend Taqueria Gonzalez. I was there yesterday and was very satisfied with their food. Service was fast and staff is very friendly and courteous. Portions are big and the taste is authentic. You won't regret eating there!<//Text>

Great Mexican breakfast dishes. They also have lots of great dishes you can’t find at other Mexican places like birria, machaca and milanesa<//Text>

Not sure how this Taqueria ranked so high on Yelp. The food is medicore at best. The cashier and cook did not understand the difference between grilled and griddled. Both salsa rojo and verde had a watery texture. The chicken was over salty and the flour tortilla was chewy because it was not warmed properly. I could go on but i will end with the fact, i will not be returning. I wasted $23.00. I would rather spend time and gas to eat in the Mission District. 3 stars is overrated.< /review>

<user>117012317647990791239</user><text>There are a couple of options, but I chose this  taqueria because there is construction going on and I wanted to give them business as I know that can make it a challenge. This decision paid off! I got a carnitas and refried bean burrito with Verde sauce. It was perfection! I was greeted with a smile and good service. At least while under construction, I don't think this is a handicap accessible option.<//text>< pictures>

Little pricey, one thing that disappointed me was the $2 taco happy hour.. the tacos are half the size of the normal tacos and only a doller less. Don't advertise $2 tacos that aren't the same portion as your normal tacos, i believe thats FALSE ADVERTISING. Other then that i love the food, great tacos and the soups are AMAZING, thats the only reason I give them 3 stars.</review>

<Review>Best tacos and burritos around Portola & Mission district! Tried so many other taquerias, but this is the go-to everytime and honestly an underrated place. I always get their Al Pastor tacoss, packed with flavor plus tacos don't get soggy and fall apart. Always excellent, caring service and delicious food. Highly recommend their breakfast, especially the Guatemalan breakfast with eggs, chorizo, beans, tortillas, YUM! Their weekend specials soups are great too. Glad this is here now!< /Review>< user>

(Translated by Google) It is very nice to eat there
The people who attend there are very respectful and very kind
Regarding the food it is very good
What I like is that if you want to make a change to your food if they have the product you want with pleasure they will do it the way you want it not anywhere thanks for your attention

(Original)

<text>Took my Sapporo girl here, she loved her white miso while I loved my spicy red miso. Naturally, miso broths won't be as creamy and pork fat flavorful as pork broths, so keep that in mind when trying the miso ramen.
Now, for both, generous slices of pork (not one like some cheap ramen shops), with enough noodles and broth to fill you up for lunch for about $10. Really hungry? $15 lunch special with the pork on rice, fried rice, gyoza, etc. Even though we were both hungry and didn't have breakfast, could only finish 75% of the fried rice + pork on rice bowls that came with our ramen.
But, this is not complaining. Fried rice is made well enough that you want to take it home for later, if you didn't already vacuum it up. Lunch special comes with teas, sodas, etc. Iced green tea was just the thing to balance out the spiciness of the red miso ramen (which isn't searing hot thankfully).
Definitely delicious, a place where you just keep eating and eating even if your mind is on something else, and before you know, it's gone! =D
Nice, comfortable spot away from the packed craziness of Sawtelle's ramen shops. Sufficient street parking at meters during the day (only 3, 4 parking spots to the side of the building free). Just remember - same building as the gym! Stay on Olympic and don't turn right (north) like Google Maps accidentally tells you. Service was prompt and attentive for the light crowd, maybe five guests at Thursday lunch.< /text><Name>David Chien</Name>< UserId.>

<text>Checked this place out (2017/6/10) after driving through Sawtelle on a crowded evening. I wasn't sure what to expect, but am quite glad to have stumbled upon this place!

What I got and what I thought:

Deluxe White Miso Ramen (2017/6/10)
- had a distinct and balanced broth flavor
- solid noodles that could absorb the soup flavor
- thick-cut pork slices that help counter the saltiness
- cabbage (along with the bamboo) help provide a variety of textures
* Something about this dish gives a soothing sense of hominess (beyond the typical ramen experience) and would entice me to come back on a monthly basis or so.

While my dining experience here was somewhat limited, I really enjoyed the food and the quiet atmosphere, and also appreciated the historic timeline of the restaurant mounted on the wall. I am looking forward to future visits to try out the rest of their menu!< /text>< Pictures>

I enjoyed this place! It is a chain restaurant that started in Japan in 1963. Got the deluxe red miso ramen, which came with a soft boiled egg (cut in half) and three thick, delicious slices of pork.

Donsanko isn't just a second or third option type of ramen shop. I can see myself coming here even if Daikokuya weren't busy.</Text>

Traditional Japanese ramen was amazing, I got the #12 Soy Sauce Ramen. Drained the bowl and a bowl of the a best white rice I've had in a while. I recommend for any of you foodies out there with a refined pallet. Yum!<//review>< rating>

Unfortunately, I have had instant ramen that was better tasting than this place.  I came here because of the good rating. Not sure why this place is getting so many good reviews.  Wow, I am still in shock at how bad this place is.  Sorry.< /Text>

The ramen is consistently good. I can't say its authentic, but it's tasty. Portions are decent. Most extras like egg and pork are considered side items that need to be ordered separately.

Service is always professional and efficient.

Best of all, we've never had a problem getting a seat!<//text>

<text>The parking is an issue here and there is no pickup parking spot if you are ordering carry out. I ordered two ramen bowls. Neither of us got the hard boiled egg that was supposed to come with the ramen and we were not given chopsticks with out order. The flavor was good but the issues with getting the food and with the order made it an unpleasant first impression of this place.< /text><time>1544539021104<//time><UserId.>113909594549155068265< /UserId.>< user_name>

<Review>SUPER delicious and authentic ramen. Might be the best kept secret near Sawtelle. The lines to every other place on the area were out the door so we decided to try this place and it did not disappoint!! The staff was so BEYOND friendly and the food was fab. Do yourself a favor and try the spicy fried rice as a side...YUM!!</Review><rate>5< /rate>< gmap_id>

<review>Tasty ramen, gyoza, and some sides. Really great value menu (ramen side and drink for about $15) and there are specials every day.  Service is very friendly. Not much decor and no alcohol but the food is delicious. Easily overlooked since little Osaka is near but worth checking out.<//review><response>None</response><Name>Steven Siu<//Name><time>1498837439148<//time>< Gmap_id>

We love this place! On our last trip we had the soy sauce and 50 year miso- both excellent. The 50 year had a good substantial broth with an extra helping of bean sprouts. The soy sauce ramen is our standard fare- the kids prefer it over any other ramen on Sawtelle. Staff are friendly. Will come back regularly!</text>

Great authentic taste,  wife is Japanese and loves it.   Good variety of Ramen aside from the too common shoyu and tonkatsu flavors.   The combos are a great deal and their fried rice is really tasty.</Review>

(Translated by Google) I got miso ramen. The soup is rich but not greasy, and the noodles are crunchy with crunchy noodles. The soup is also hot and full of vegetables. It was really delicious.
It is a ramen of Japanese taste.
The dessert apricot tofu was also delicious!

味噌ラーメンを頂きました。スープは濃厚ですが脂っこくなく、麺はちぢれ麺でツルッとしています。スープも熱々でお野菜たっぷり。本当に美味しく完食しました。
日本のほっとするお味のラーメンです。
デザートの杏仁豆腐も美味でした！< /Text>

The crust was pretty bad. It was straightout bread like 7-11, The Pizza was really dull and nothing to enjoy. It was a 5 point Pizza! That's the review.</review>

It's my favorite pizza out of all pizzas in San Jose. Their pizzas don't make me bloated or feel tired like all other places. Their prices are a little on the higher side but it's worth paying for.

<text>The best pizza, period. My parents were eating here before I was born, I'm over 50. It's very hearty pizza, i would consider it Sicilian style pizza. Not the best neighborhood, but always worth the trip. The attached pic shows a medium combo and a mini salami.</text>< gmapID>

It has very good flavor & i always ask for a thinner crust than the regular one,but that's a personal choice otherwise it's too much dough.</Text>

< review>
Terrible Pizza!!! I notice a lot of the people who have given this place 4 or 5 stars have been acquainted with the location since childhood. It's possible that nostalgia has a lot to do with the rating because the pizza is horrendous. For the price, you should get a mainstream pizzeria pizza.
The pizza is very doughy and it has minimal sauce. The toppings don't mix! They look just like the pictures on the images tab and they run off and just leave a flavorless dough behind. I've eaten here twice and have been disappointed twice! The people who linger in the area are less than savory as well,  and I just recommend you avoid the spot...< /review>

I guess I go to Renatos Pizza because it brings back a lot of childhood memories!  Like when the Green parrot used to be next-door was some crazy fights back in the days in this pizza place!  The pizza quality  not the same like when Mr. Renato himself owned it.  Their customer service definitely needs help  nowadays they can be a little bit rude!!! I will  from time to time go grab something to eat there!  Not expecting too much with customer service  or quality of food the pizzas I guess just OK. Maybe if  they would work on their attitude  their food would  probably taste  a little  better!< /text>

We walked in at 8:30 and they closed at 10. Just asked “what we wanted” with our giving us a menu. I asked for a beer and again, “what do you want.” I don’t know where’s your beer list, how do I know? It was terrible. The pizza however isn’t that bad. Little sweet for my taste. I have never felt so unwelcome and confused.</Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

Been going here for years really good pizza. Pizzas are cut in squares so its something different and good. Nice to have the choice of a middle or an end piece. I usually ask for extra sauce because its a little dry and I can't tell the difference really. That's not gonna stop me from going though because its really good< /review>

I have been coming to Renato's since the early 70's when Renato himself made and served your pizza.  Simply put there is no comparison to this great pizza! Their crust has a sweet taste like no other. Most crust are pretty boring elsewhere, not at Renato's. I love the fact that all the ingredients are placed under the cheese. Our family comes all the way from South San Jose to eat pizza here, no other establishment compares.<//review>

This pizza is the BEST in San Jose, Ca Love it!!! Trust me the Combo is my favorite. I remember in 86' 87' my Father and I would pick up the pizza, every Friday night. Mr. Renato would complain to my dad about his cheap son in-law (49ers) I can't remember his name. I'm 41 my Father is 71 and we still enjoy it.<//review>

I heard good things about this place, saw great reviews, my husband said he had been going for many years then stopped for a while, we decided to go for dinner it was my first time and I must say it's not what I expected, the cashier was great, but I was disappointed with the pizza it was cold and had a different taste to it, this was a one time deal for me.< /review>

Good pizza. And looks pretty clean. But dayummm. Horrible. Service. All of them. On a horrible mood. You can't ask for anything. Because they'll bark at you. I can't say is the best pizza. It's pretty. Good. But before I eat. It is have to fight with the cooks. To be more polite.  The< /review>

PROS: Clean restaurant, Arcade, and banquet seating area.

CONS: No public restroom, Sub-par customer service, Steep price for the quality of pizza. Half the ingredients on the pie were ok, the other half was barely covered in any sauce whatsoever, overly spicy sausage that was fine, but didn't mesh at all with the other toppings, aaaaaaand last but not least OMG! WHY IS THE CRUST SWEET! As if shortening or something was in the actual dough itself. The texture was close to that of store-bought cookies. Bugs me that I paid 30+ dollars for mediocre pizza. Somebody put the pizzas on a leash, they're running wild.< /review>

<Text>It's one of the best local pizza joints around but it could be THE best. I've been eating this pizza since I was in the womb. Anyone remember when the Old Italian owner would hang out with patrons? Autographed 49er memorabilia on the wall. The Green Parrot was still open then. The place used to be packed. Music blasting, beer flowing, arcade room. Nostalgia. Combo was to die for!!! Juices soaked through the pizza box. Every bite was pure spicy chorizo bliss.
Then the owner passed and his daughter took over. You no longer saw the same faces baking. Renovations took place, flavor changed (price didn't). Corners were cut. Less sauce.
Yes, the dough is still sweet. The combo doesn't have that kick to it anymore. But I still consider it the King of Pizza.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

Good food, good price. Nice San Jose interpretation of Italian favorite...chorizo, yum.

Restaurant is a little divey, but that doesn't stop us from going time and time again.

Enjoy.<//review>

I met Mia at the reception. She was extremely courteous and thorough with the entire process. It took me a while to understand the details as this was my first time renting public storage but, Mia was very patient and like a pro guided me through all the steps. She even helped me download and activate the app on my phone that I could then use to access this facility. My experience here has been great!

I would highly recommend this facility to anyone reading this review and looking to rent storage units.< /review></record>

<review>CUSTOMER SERVICE IS DEAD.
Politeness is not customer service, it is common curtesy. Doing a job is not customer service, it is mandatory for compensation based on an employee/employer agreement. Customer service is not telling a customer that a system is the cause of not being able to take action. Otherwise, we need only to rely on technology and robots without the use of humans. Actual customer service should supersede a system because a human is suppose to recognize and do what a system cannot. This location does not understand this concept, but are they blameless because many other places also lack this ability? To say I am disappointed is an understatement. Customer service is what rights wrongs but when it is not exercised, what remains in lasting form is only the wrong that was committed. The system is set up to always win, and will fail the customer if it is followed without regard to human error. Humans should have the basic compassion to manually correct human and system errors. We need more than just robots in electronic and flesh form. Public Storage, thanks for asking how I really feel, because regardless of whether you care or not... this will be stated: you need to do better. Stop using people robots for calls and email. Have genuine customer service in place at your locations. Be able to take proper action that benefits the customer too. Customers are what make a business, so do not do them wrong just because you are a larger company. There’s enough trash out here. Believe me, it is not too difficult and is better for business and average business ratings. All I kindly asked several (more than once) times is for basic customer service to be exercised for something that your company did wrong, not even me! and that was simply too complicated for your robot system or robot humans to recognize. I am bereaved at the loss of customer service as a whole in this modern time and the proof was displayed from this past week through your company, Public Storage. I would ask you to “take action”, but that would likely overload your system of robots (electronic or human) because they will not understand what that means. What a useless battle this has been. Future patrons: do not be surprised by a bit trash in units (from above or on the side) and piss smelling elevators for 2nd/3rd floor accessing patrons.</review></record>

With the help from Mia, Arlene and Christina R., we have smoothly and successfully completed the inspections of our stored personal property and furniture. Their willingness to help made a seemingly difficult task to be smooth.<//text>

< Review>
This storage facility is always immaculate. We have been using it for two years now.
The staff is always professional and courteous, especially Mia.
She is friendly beyond words and goes out of her way to help whenever she can. As much as we begged her, she would not accept a tip. So, at her insistence, we’re leaving this review instead.
Thank you!<//Review>

Laughing so hard, such an awesome time here.

Great price, super clean. She closed the deal!

And we got an awesome space to store our stuff. Looking forward to seeing here when we come by!

Thanks so much!< /Review>< pictures>

I’m a paying customer at this business and I can’t charge my phone in the lobby for 5 minutes?!? Why am I being treated like a homeless person lol.< /Text>< pictures>

This location itself seems safe because it is inside unlike most places I have viewed within the area. I made my reservation online then I went to the office to complete the process. I had the pleasure of experiencing Joy. She helped me with everything! From providing allllll the information, giving me the keys and walking me to my unit. The unit was very neat and well kept (so that was exciting)! Joy provided excellent help and I will always refer this particular  public storage in the future when asked. Thank you!< /Text>

<Text>I have been at this location since 2011 & have noted many different storage agents ... (I also have been A Flt Attendant 4 over 48 yrs 4 United Airlines), this is my way of saying ‘that’ I know what good customer service “IS”.  Joy personifies “Good” CS...she’s smart, knows her product, listens, gives U info that U would not know 2 ask, she’s professional, kind & from what I have observed,  a hard worker & best of all...she’s consistent!!!  U have a true diamond...I appreciate all her efforts.    Thanks 4 listening.</Text><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None<//Response>< gmapID>

I highly recommend this Storage facility.Great customer service and clean facility.I had a major problem after Christmas in losing my keys to my storage space.Associate Miguel acted fast in what was supposed to be a 2 week wait for technicians to change my lock.He got it done in a couple of hours which made my day.The other associates are always kind as well</Review>

<Text>This place is in a very convenient location and pleasantly clean. I feel safe leaving my belongings here and was greeted as soon as I entered. Jyan was at the front desk and described everything in detail. Not only was she thorough, she was pleasant to talk to and had answers to all my questions. Araceli was also present and joined with the walk through. I give this place a 5 stars!< /Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNiBEGvqNnn6DHx34W1d1cn12FNX6fLpM2XgnSo=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures>< Response>

Great location between two modern office buildings at the Western Avenue exit off the 405 Freeway. Seems like new construction compared to the El Segundo Public Storage location. Entire building is air condtioned so you won't be sweating your nuts off while loading or unloading.<//text>

The service here was outstanding!! Not that I have had experience with many storage facilities. But definitely had a lot of customer service encounters, and this person made my experience here, an absolute delight. Thank you Joy!!  I appreciate your patience and understanding, and especially your willingness to help. YOU do Public Storage a Public Service!< /review>

Went there to buy some boxes for moving and the lady at the front believe her name was JOY. She was amazing from greeting me when I entered, to helping me figure out the size boxes I needed, to getting me the exact price. I'ts the little things that matter in making a store feel welcoming.</text>

<text>I had my unit broken into... only to find out from the police officer that 7 units had been broken into ... And that it happens frequently at this facility. I guess since it doesn’t hurt them financially they don’t make changes to protect their customers. The “ceiling” is wire mesh that the thieves just cut through and go from unit to unit. If I were you I would find a storage unit with solid roof or be prepared to have your stuff stolen at some point. I had only been with them 5 months when this happened. I can tell the front desk people are embarrassed but really can’t do much about it. Other than that I have no problem with this facility :-/< /text>< Pics>

Very clean, all indoors, staff very helpful. The only complaint is the garage door seems to break a lot.
Very inconvenient to haul you stuff up the ramp. And if your elderly it almost impossible.< /Text>

I am a returning customer.   I have always liked my Public Storage experience at this location.  But I wanted to make a special effort to commend both Arlene and Danielle for how they made my return pleasant, easy and efficient.  Great attitudes!  Great service!   I recommend this facility, and these employees, to anyone who is looking for a clean, secure, well managed storage facility.< /review>

<review>Earlier this morning went to this Public Storage on 190th. If I could give 10/10 I would cause Rita was awesome! She was very informative about my options w/ the units but she didn’t pressure me into getting just anything; which is key. Helping me setup my online account, to going over every detail w/ me, to showing me how everything works she was great! I couldn’t have asked for a better experience. That’s not to say the other guys/girls there weren’t great, but she took care of me from beginning to end. Anytime I need anything I’ll be looking for Rita! Thank you again I really appreciate.

This location is newly built, still being painted when I came to rent storage. I really needed a space for a good price and fast. Nieshia and Arlene came to the rescue. They were both very friendly and helpful in offering me a space that both fit my needs and my pockets. Did I mention they were fast, because I was in and out in under 18 mins.< /text>

<username>Andrya Salazar< /username><text>When I arrived one of the male workers tried to tell me the price of the unit was not going to be the same as the price I had reserved it for, despite having the reservation. Nieshia quickly stepped in to help us and ensure us that they were able to do a price adjustment. She was proactive and overall very helpful! Units are clean.</text>< time>

<review>Great customer service and a great location to store your valuables. It's right off the 405 freeway which gives easy access. The place being air conditioned is a plus with the ability to load and unload in an indoor-docking bay. Which means, you don't have to worry about the rain or what not. The workers are so helpful and pleasant. They always say hi when you come in. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone.<//review>< Date>

Arlene and Kody were excellent and I got a great move in deal! Bring a Lantern, the units are dark. No overhead lighting since they couldn't get to it to replace a bulb or electricity. I wish the office opened earlier but oh well. Still a great deal and a clean safe place!< /Review>

<Text>Quick and easy set up to get my storage unit. Very clean facility. Easy instructions on how to use my access code and where to use them at. Signing up was easy as 1,2,3. Climate controlled units as stated. Kody and Nieshia took care of me. Great customer service.<//Text>< pictures>

<Text>The public storage representative Victor was very helpful and friendly.  He gave me a tour of the facility and helped me with everything I needed to know about my entrance code, the hours of operation, the ins and outs of the facility and basically everything I needed to know. Victor was very thorough with everything.  As far as the facility is concerned, it is modern, clean, and very accessible.  The hours of operation are good as well.  Thanks for everything.</Text>< rating>

Zero star, unit was sold before without my consent. No notification was send out that this was happen. Manager Derik is thief beware. Not a safe place no cameras around units so is easily to break in and steal or put in another unit. This location needs to be shut down and all staff should be pursuit for criminal acts. Please stay away from this place< /Review>

Upon my visit, an associate by the name of Adie provided services for us and she was excellent! She made sure that we were pleased with our storage rental and provided assistance to reassure that it met our storage needs!  She truly cared about customer satisfaction! She was friendly, professional, and made us feel so comfortable! She made the environment so warm and welcoming for us and other customers. We came in so stressed from all of the moving we were doing lately and she was so helpful! Wow, this type of customer service is a breath of fresh air! I would recommend this location to anyone looking for a welcoming, stress free, and accessible storage facility. Also the covered parking lot for customer loading is splendid. I am a customer that is well pleased:)<//text><time>1380935325842<//time><rate>5</rate>< Gmap_id>

Great storage rooms!  Don't access my storage too often, forgot how to open the locked sliding door.  Brandon from the office helped me and showed me how easy it is open the sliding door and yes, the lock does come out so you can slide the lock to an unlock position.
Everyone in the office very helpful and nice.  Great customer service!</review>

<name>Steven Bower< /name><date>1389800144956< /date><rate>5<//rate><Review>Excellent in every way. This nearly new facility is 10 miles from my home but well worth the extra distance. The facility has passcode security for the elevators and storage units are accessible 15 hours a day 7 days a week. Climate controlled and very clean. The staff have been extremely helpful through the move in process and when I needed to change from a medium to a large storage unit and also to arrange for cart access outside of business hours many times. There is a large lighted area inside building to load and unload which has never been full when I visited. There is a large parking lot at the front of the building so space is never a problem. A large selection of boxes and other supplies are available for purchase. I cannot think of anything to improve. Thanks.<//Review>< pictures>

Excellent customer service and facility. I have been to a couple of storage facilities and by far this one has been the cleanest and most organized of all. I was impressed on how welcoming the employees were as soon as I open the door, they greet you with a smile  which is always nice to see. I can say that this facility has great customer service, Maria the employee that helped me was explicit with her answers and  let me tell you I had a lot of questions and she sure answered every single one thoroughly and with a smile. I would truly recommend this facility for it's clean and has great customer service.< /Text>

<GmapID>0x80c2b559e99cb4d1:0x1e6dbc460936d457</GmapID><Response>None</Response><review>I don’t like their process of taking our license when we want to borrow a dolly because the workers be leaving on break or something and by the time we’re finished storing, there’s no one at the office to give us our license back so we have to wait and that’s not right. What if we’re in a rush and have somewhere to go? They need to switch off workers or something during breaks so there will always be someone in the office. Also, the workers should not close storage until they received all of their dollies back because they’re holding everyone’s licenses. There have been cases where all the workers just leave without reaching out to the people borrowing the dollies then all the doors be locked and people can’t get their licenses back until the next day. They need a better system. This one is not it! Don’t take people’s licenses or get better workers!< /review></record></dataset><record>

Raul. This one is for you and Valerie.

Facility is outstanding, enclosed loading/unloading area with easy access to the elevators. Units themselves are in a controlled environment and well lit and well ventilated. Units are accessible from 6am to 9pm. My other unit with a competitor costs me more, 7-7 access and isn't as nice. The staff that I dealt with (Raul and Valerie) were very professional and very friendly.

Pros:
-lovely staff and not just to look at
-enclosed loading/unloading area.
-great units
-competitive price

Cons:
-proprietary locks required
-you don't get to set your own access code to the elevators and the process is a bit awkward.
-They won't let me move into my unit.... I even said please.<//Review>

She helps me when I forget my code...politely reminds me my bill is due.

I enjoy coming into storage bc we always have a good laugh.

Public Storage needs more Nieshia across the country bc of her good attitude and happy personality.

Thank you for having fabulous employees like Nieshia!

Excellent customer service and facility. I have been to a couple of storage facilities and by far this one has been the cleanest and most organized of all. I was impressed on how welcoming the employees were as soon as I open the door, they greet you with a smile and cordiality which is always nice to see. I can say that this facility has great customer service, Bristy the employee that helped me was super nice with her answers . I had a lot of questions and she sure answered every single one thoroughly and with a smile. I would truly recommend this facility for it's clean and has great customer service.</Review>

I had to move quickly and wanted a place that was close to my new living location in Hermosa Beach. This location was perfect! It was easy to get to bc it’s off a main road and close to the 405, it was so clean and the ladies in the office Arlene & Nieshia were so sweet and a pleasure to meet when I was getting my unit set up! I would def rent here again. Thanks!<//review>

They are always friendly & helpful! We moved to the area about 2 years ago & chose this location because it was indoors, not too far from home, has convenient hours, and it is clean. It took us a while to decide where to store our household goods since we moved into a smaller house from out-of-state.  We are very happy that we chose this location!  All of the storage facilities closer to our house were not climate controlled, cost more & usually drive-up type.  (We had a drive up storage in Spokane & although it can be easier, it was humid & musky even though it was a brand new facility. Plus we had so many bugs at that one!) I will definitely chose indoor facilities from now on, just like this one!!!

Adie has been there to help us out since we started.  They contacted us at the first sign of something possibly leaking by our unit, luckily nothing was damaged or leaking inside, but it is good to know they actually take a look at things!  It is easy to drive up close to get things in & out.  They offer carts free of charge to use which is very helpful, I use them almost every time I go there. Every associate has always been helpful & courteous.

It is located right off of the 405, close to shopping & not far from my husband's job.  It is never too crowded to find close parking.  I would recommend this location!</Text>

Well first and for most i loved the old workers that use to be here they had extremely good customer service. (  Adie )

Now in 2019 your staff aren't to friendly very lazy and they act like the Don't want to work. The orher weekend i came with my fiance and he had to use the restroom they didnt want to open it for him and then as soon as i arrived they opened the restroom for me. Now today once again you worker Niesha is very rude and we dound a crack pipe on the ground that they acted like they didnt want to pick up. I have a picture of it and im sending it to the corporate office</Review>

<gmapID>0x80c2b559e99cb4d1:0x1e6dbc460936d457</gmapID><review>I am very disappointed in my experience here. When I got my storage, I was not told that in 6 months, the price would increase 20%, which is almost a $60 increase for my storage unit. I've rented many storages in the past, including a different Public Storage, and I've never experienced this. Some storages such as U-Haul actually decreased the rate after a certain period as an incentive to keep customers who pay on time. When I called the corporate office to express my concerns, the representative told me that the contract I signed says, "subject to change" and therefore they are able to make an "executive decision" to raise rates 20%. This forces many customers to downsize (where the price will again increase in 6 months) or pay the higher rate, as it is a huge hassle to rent a truck and movers to move to a new storage. I feel that this practice is very unethical. I would not recommend this storage - there are many nice storages in the Gardena/ Redondo Beach area without this policy. It may also be helpful to look at the reviews of this storage on Yelp.</review>< Pics>

We have another unit at a different location. After speaking with the manager on duty,we discovered that this location had much less rates!! I sent my daughter in and rented a 5x5 to store her things. She said the staff was very nice and the location was super clean.<//Review>

<Text>Called in and made a last minute request to see some available storage units and spoke with Andie. She was great and friendly over the phone. When I showed up to meet with Andie she was just fantastic totally super friendly and very helpful answered all my questions with ease and was just perfect in everyway possible I swear she is small but so adorable and so beyond sweet I swear I would totally put her in my pocket and take her home with me if i could but obviously that would be impossible but again if you need help she would be the go to person for great info, insight and help. Was totally worth checking out and yes i did sign up for a storage unit just for the simple fact of Andie being so lovable and great! Thanks Andie so much for everything you are perfect in everyway imaginable and a dream to be an employee for any company...Public Storage should feel privileged to have someone like you working for them. ;)< /Text><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< GmapID>

Nice place, nice staff.. the only thing I didn't like was that I was specifically told I didn't need to pay my rent until the 7th, due to a late move in. I specifically said AT THE TIME OF MOVE IN I was only renting for one month. So I go to close my account and I am told I need to pay second month because "their policy changed" and they didn't bother to let any of the customers know about this change(no email or phone call). So I had to pay an extra month just to close out my storage. Spoke with the manager, he said he would call back but never can seem to get ahold of him since the first talk I had with him over the phone.<//Review>

<Review>Adie

I have experienced some wonderful assistance from Adie on numerous occasions. She is one of the finest, most informed people I have ever dealt with. She seems to know the business here at Public Storage inside and out.  She must be an excellent asset to your company.  I wanted to take a moment to write a sterling review for her because she is worth every bit of it.</Review><date>1463183638324</date></record>

Adie, Bristy, & Maria provided excellent customer service. The facility is clean, well maintained, and secure. I shopped around and the customer service is what sold me. These ladies were knowledgeable and made me feel like my needs were what mattered. By far the best storage experience I've had (and I have rented a lot of storage units.)< /Review>

<Review>I have been to a few Public Storage facilities in the LA Metro area, and I can tell you that it was worth it to make the drive from Hollywood all the way to Gardena to rent from this location.  The facility is in terrific condition.  It's clean, bright, spacious, and well maintained.  And, it offers better pricing than almost all other locations which didn't seem quite as nice.  Plus, Adie, the manager, and her staff are all super friendly and willing to work with you if you have any important needs/concerns.  They are very easy to work with.  I would recommend this location to anyone needing a storage space.</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None</Resp><gmap_id>0x80c2b559e99cb4d1:0x1e6dbc460936d457<//gmap_id></record>

Sandra was excellent!!!. Her attitude and the way she presented herself was  continually pleasant,  attentive,  and patient. She listened very carefully to muy situation and my needs.  I ama realtor attempting to accommodate my client who is presently out of the area. My client is a existing customer of Pubic Storage.  Sandra was also helped to make a call to my office as i forgot my phone there.  In spite of nearing the closing time, she continued to exemplifying fantastic customer services. She even stayed longer to make sure I understood everything to process me. I would highly recommend Sandra and this location . Please be assured I checked several other companies and location.

Best regards,

<Text>I been renting this facility for over a year and I am pleased with the excellent service I have received. Adie and counterparts have provided a professional and outstanding assistance in all my needs. From making the initial contract an easy and fast process, offering and explaining the offers and services Public Storage have; maintaining communication and following through on my needs and requirements. I can’t thank enough for all the help I have received. The cleanliness of the establishment and friendly approach of their personal (especially Adie’s), make of Public Storage a unique storage experience.<//Text>< Time>

I went in to look at the storage unit I reserved. Niesha, helped me out GREATLY. I left here with a better unit and a Better Price..Niesha's customer service was AWESOME. She was pleasant, professional and patient with me. Very very helpful in helping me make my decision. . I thanked God for Niesha, help and the storage place was very clean. The entire facility was. I am happy to say that I left Public Storage smiling and doing my Happy dance...Niesha- thank you so very much. You have no idea how GREATLY you helped me out. Keep up the great work. 😀👌🎉< /review>

Very great overall experience at this facility. Everything was clean, and the staff were wonderful! Adie, Maria, and Bristy took care of me, and answered all my questions, and addressed my concerns. I would recommend the facility to anyone needing storage solutions.  Was glad to find a place to put all my furniture from prior to my move. Maria showed me the space, and I left with all the info I needed. Thank you!!!</review>

<Review>Hi. My name is Tony and I brought my uncle Henry Gilbert who is well loved here. Adie has excellent service and makes people feel comfortable and at ease. She has a humorous nature and makes people laugh. She makes us wanna come here often. She is not just good but EXCELLENT. She makes you feel comfortable when you talk to her. If Public Storage wants to promote then it should be Adie because she deserves all that and more. She has a smile that makes the sun shine. Thank you for everything Adie.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None< /resp><Gmap_id>0x80c2b559e99cb4d1:0x1e6dbc460936d457<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

When I signed up for this storage space at the end of 2011 it was the best deal in the area.  I haven't priced units recently so I don't know if the price is still competitive.
I have a space on the 3rd floor.  Sometimes I have problems accessing the elevator but it just means having to input my password 2 or 3 times.
The bathroom on the 3rd floor does not work - it has not worked since I moved in.
There are no trash cans available, either.
I understand Public Storage might be concerned about a) the customers destroying the restroom, and b) dealing with dumping problems, but isn't that part of the business?
Adie is the manager in the office and has been there since I began renting while all the other employees have come and gone.  I hope Public Storage is paying her a decent wage because she deserves it!< /text>

From the day I became a customer in July of 2012 Adie has been helpful, friendly and knowledgeable. She always has a pleasant smile on her face and always gives me words of encouragement. I am grateful for such a sweet and kind manager. Her staff always looks happy, the facility is always clean, and customers always seems to be satisfied. I would recommend this particular location to anyone I know. Keep up the awesome work Adie and the staff of public storage in Gardena, CA.< /review>

Customer service Rep Antwone was extremely knowledgeable and very pleasant this past Saturday at this new location. My wife and I said that  Public Storage needs more customer service reps like Antwone who really went beyond the call of duty to get us setup with our new storage locker in Gardena... Thanks Antwone<//review>

I am a fan of this public storage here in Gardena, as the best and most efficient storage service my company has utilized from prior companies.  I might add, Adie has been the face of good  customer service to my experience here. I welcome and can always count on her knowledgeable and helpful and courteous, highly pleasant smile to brighten my interactions at public storage Gardena.

Last year, when I was in need of a storage space, I had actually already reserved a space elsewhere when I happened to drive by the Public Storage on 190th St.  On a whim, I stopped by "just to see" what they had to offer.  Adie was the one who greeted me & enthusiastically shared information about their facility. It just so happened that there was a space available in a terrific location, too. I signed up immediately & cancelled my other reservation.  I have been completely happy w/this decision.  The staff is the BEST.  Always friendly & helpful!  The place sparkles w/their care.  Victor (also always smiling & friendly!) was polishing the elevator when I was there last week!  They all work very hard to keep the place spic & span!  The place is well-lit, temperature-controlled, & completely clean.  There are carts available (free rental) to ferry boxes & heavy items to your storage space.  There is also a nice restroom facility, & the office has packing materials for purchase.  It is the best place to store your things!  But the icing on the cake is the terrific staff who are always kind, caring, & helpful.  Heartwarming!  (P.S.  I stopped by there last week, & Adie knew me by name & my space number instantly, even though I had not seen her in a few months.  Talk about great customer service!!  She is amazing!)</review>

< Review>
I have been using storage facilities for about 8 years now and I when I opted recently to use the 1459 W 190th St, Gardena, CA as my new storage location, I didn't know that it was going to exceed my expectations I usually have when dealing with facility management.  As soon as I got there, Adie and Victor, greeted me with a smile and had a positive ability to go the extra mile to make sure a)they wanted my business and b)they wanted to keep my business.  I initially wanted a smaller unit but after Adie heard my needs she instantly recommended another better option for her available inventory that would best suit my needs.  I think I've been there about 5-6 months and I have never had a hassle getting in and out of the facility and the fact that they maintain it clean and spotless and have I think 8-10 X-Large carts available for you to use, they should have the option to give 10 stars instead of 5.</Review>

"The twelve best practices are found in companies that exemplify excellent customer service. These practices are not just something the company does, the practices are the company. Every employee in the company must understand and carry out these practices on a daily basis. Hiring people with the right attitudes and keeping them constantly trained, rewarded and recognized for demonstrating the best of these twelve practices is the way that companies achieve success. It is essential that the top person in the organization, CEO or owner also demonstrate these practices; not just among external customers, but among those internal customers, especially employees. Remembering that happy employees make happy customers is a critical bit of advice for every chief executive."

< review>
I had actually lost faith in the spirit of customer service. But, when I came to the Gardena Public Storage (190th Street,) that faith was restored.  Adie, Maria, Bristy, and Victor are outstanding.   I worked in a storage place in Seattle, WA and thought I gave great customer sevice, but these folks at the Gardena Public Storage (190th Street, outshined me by far.

I give the facility a AAA rating. I  give the staff a AAA+ rating.  They are off the charts.  ;-)<//review>

<text>(Translated by Google) ABOUT THIS SURVEY I WOULD LIKE IT TO BE MORE AVAILABLE IN SPANISH DUE TO THE GREAT AMOUNT OF PEOPLE WHO SPEAK IN SPANISH BUT I LIKE THESE MEDIA FOR WHICH I THANK THE PEOPLE IN THE DISPLAY TO BE BILINGUAL AND TREAT THE CLIENT AS WELL IN THIS LOCATION, I FEEL VERY WELL TO HAVE FOUND THIS PLACE WITH SO GOOD MAINTENANCE, CLEAN, ORDERLY, AND THE FIRST ADMISSION SERVICE OF ACCESSIBILITY TO ENTER AND EXIT THE ESTABLISHMENT FOR THAT RETURN TO THIS LOCATION, AND RECOMMEND ME WITH YOU A LITTLE FAR FROM MY ADDRESS BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER TO HANDLE A LITTLE MORE IF I RECEIVE THIS FIRST THANK YOU SERVICE!
