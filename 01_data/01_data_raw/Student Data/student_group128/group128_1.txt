Let's be honest you have your good days and you have your bad days. Overall I have loved working here. I enjoyed building relationships with coworkers here and enjoyed the equipment and service this company provides. The pay is competitive for OTR when you look at the big picture. Bottom line is they are up front and honest so you know what you sign up for. Absolutely no complaints from me. Carry on.<//review></record></dataset><record>

Critical- 2/12 driving southbound on the 99 out of Sacramento heading towards Stockton their company driver almost caused what could have been a 5 car pile up. I also observed the driver:
1. Road rage
2. Tailgating
3. Abrupt lane changes
4. Cutting off others
5. No signal
Posting here today for public record. Also, will be following through with gov/state agencies.
No interest in contacting company,  they seem to have a recurring theme with their responses....either you're a fake post or have the wrong company. I'm neither of those. Be cautious and safe when you observed these trucks on the roads.<//review>

I have had multiple incidents of unprofessional and unsafe drivers with this company including today.

One thing they’re famous for is road rage. Even if you did ABSOLUTELY nothing towards them. Very unsafe too. Abrupt lane changing, drifting out of lanes, cutting off others, no signals, etc.

When I called in they didn’t seem too concerned. If you see one of their trucks on the road be careful and expect issues. Their drivers don’t know what the hell they’re doing.< /Text>

<review>Not trusted and not recommended

It's funny to see the safety department try and block these reviews that tell the truth And ask every review for their name, not solve the issues.

They once ran the company without insurance. Because the company is cheep.

The safety department loves authority over drivers so much so they just a nag and fire people.

Yes they did run without insurance and there a paper inside all the registration document folder that talks about how they do you have insurance now and that they ran out without insurance and got caught by the federal government.< /review>< pics>

If you need fresh refrigerated products delivered then look no further!!! This is the best reefer company in America. All of the trailers are equipped with the newest features to help keep everything at the perfect temperature!! But if you are looking to be a driver, this is your chance to have a safe and exciting career. I can personally tell you that the leadership in this company are genuinely interested in their associate development. They care about their drivers and the staff is very understanding/will work with you.<//text>

<review>I requested that they send someone to estimate what it would cost. They assured me they can determine that by the furniture I check off on their list. I give them a deposit, they came to put the furniture on the truck. After several pieces the head guy says I can't put anymore on bc you've reached 5000 Lbs. Had to pay an extra $500 for him to take a few more pieces and they didn't even take 1/2 of what I needed transported.
I gave them a delivery date based on what the builder told me, when the date changed I called B&B to let them know the date was changed from April 15 and would let them know as soon as I knew the new date.  B&B called in 4/15 to ask me where I wanted them to drop the stuff off. Extremely rude rep from B& B hung up when I explained I had notified his office the date had changed. They dropped my furniture off not at my new house and now I have to pay to have every thing to move everything again. There were items that I have taken pictures of that were broken and will have to send to the insurance company.

Anyone looking to hire B&B Transportation for a move DON'T!!!!   YOU WILL REGRET IT<//review>< pictures>

I wish I could rate this company negatively because I would. Before making a move across the country, I first worked with Alan Douglas (moving coordinator) because he would not stop sending follow up emails, so I figured they were reliable. I REGRET NOT LOOKING UP ANY OF B&B TRANSPORTATION'S REVIEWS BEFORE BOOKING THEM.

Alan told me that it would take 7-10 business days for my boxes to arrive. After I agreed to work with B&B, I stopped hearing from Alan. I left voicemails and send emails to Alan, but he never returned any calls or emails. I still have not heard from him.

I'm FURIOUS with how the company's employees were trained. The customer service representatives LIED TO ME EVERYDAY when I had called them (3 straight weeks, Monday - Friday); they told me that my boxes were being picked up from the warehouse "tomorrow" more than a dozen times. IF THEY WOULD HAVE TOLD ME THE TRUTH FROM THE BEGINNING, I would not have been so upset.

Finally, after 27 business days... my boxes get delivered to my house (all smushed up and bent out of shape). I have CLEARLY LABLED my boxes "fragile!" with a sharpie on bright pink scotch tape used to tape the box shut (not to mention I wrote all over the box, "fragile!" "very fragile!". The first box I open has broken glass and a broken durable vase. I am not going to try to fight this company and get my money back - I just want everyone to know my experience with this company, so they can avoid broken items and an outrageously delayed ETA.

IF this is how my things were going to be treated and was going to take this long, B&B needs to tell their customers AHEAD OF TIME, so I can clearly choose another company. THIS COMPANY DOES NOTHING BUT LIE AND DECEIVE THEIR CUSTOMERS.<//review>

I regret moving my stuff with B&B Transport,  they are not kind people to deal with. They called you day & night to get your business and throw you off the bus. They will lie to you of one month free storage, they don't do certified weighing, all they will tell after making deposit and pick up date is that they have a weighing sensor to know your stuff even though they already have some other people stuff in the truck, and they end up giving you an outrageous weight figures and price. Watch out for those paper work they will asked you to sign and be wise to make copy cos they do funny. Their dispatch department are the most rudest people in mankind,  they tell you to go to hell and paid the delivery driver and so you know they will start threatened you of auctioning your belonging if you don't pay or meet the date they scheduled your delivery and so you know they will call you for early pick up and delivery base on their own time and wouldn't care about your situation, also make you sign 28 days delay delivery  if needed. They will also blacklist your number after their atrocities,  but I figure out and went ahead to call them with different number and they picked up. PLS SAVE YOURSELF  FROM THESE WORST SITUATION, TAKE YOUR BUSINESS ELSEWHERE.<//Review>

I'm new to the company , but in a very short period of time , I can say this is one of the best companies I've ever driven for . Usually I can tell right away what kind of company ,  management , dispatch , etc. ,  I'm dealing with . Believe me , I have no problem handing keys back and quitting the company if I'm not happy . This company hired me on knowing I had special circumstances that would need to be met in order for me or be able to drive for them . They gave me there word it would not be a problem . Of course I was still leary once I started driving because of past promises from other companies that were given just to get me on the road but never held there end of the bargain . That's just not the case here at B&B . They have been great ! In every department ! Easy to communicate with , never left hangin with any issue , always able to contact someone 24/7 ect. . Thus far , I'm happy to say , I'm glad I've signed on with them . I'm willing to bet that the negative reviews are because they've (ones writing the negative review) done something wrong and are mad at themselves for ruining a good gig and don't know how to take responsibility for there own mistakes or they have nothing better to do with there day but to talk bad about something so they can feel better about there own , low self esteemed , selves . Lol , just sayin. Thanks for everything so far B&B . You've been awesome!<//text>

The pork spring rolls were amazing and the vermicelli dish was great! Super good ginger sauce too. My disappointment with this place is the kids working there. Literally children.  Watching cartoons and serving people. I get it. But there were missing items from what we ordered and my food didn't come out for over 25 min. There were 2 other people there. I was shocked at how delicious everything was but it was not a good experiance.<//Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipML4P0TClOFK4z8wTkO0dbYvQ4C3x-TT3uyji3A=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNRxWEFW8kVcm7YmOaXg-oFoSWn2E3mrjqVFeBS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO5uuE1_BeXtTFYu_46bxx1Nbb5OAKGwmddb-HE=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO20lO5x9qRDjzlzm5TqvpUY6Q3MIz67p5ojPk3=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNlEZHzWM2_tnPP5yQ5yiV-R2081IWppbcKP_XJ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOw2HNDKN9wtOCdin5IF0CuDtsenK07kTgUCITA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM13tTRpse189xF4nUCYInWqYMx7cF4K5UfRODq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures>< Resp>

< Review>
I absolutely love the food here. Their vermicelli with bbq beef is to die for!! The Vietnamese egg rolls Are the best!! And the Boba Thai tea is the best I’ve ever had. You just can’t go wrong. Their food is sooo good!  It is A very small restaurant but what a gem. The only critique I have is that sometimes it takes a while to get your food when ordering to-go. But no big, just call 30 mins ahead and you’re good. Also Before, they would take a while to come to the front and help you because they were in the back cooking but they now have a bell and hired a new girl and have improved immensely. You have to give them a try!<//Review>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Review>This place is hidden but SO DELICIOUS! The employees are very inviting and the food is delicious. You can tell the ingredients are fresh and made with lots of time and love. Most vegetable pho's I have tried don't carry the punch of flavor this one has. I will continue to drive out of my way for this place. I'm so happy to find this place. I like that they are open late too< /Review>< Pics>

<Text>Got our Pho Ga order to go, and my oh my - it was great take out! Pho is difficult to nail as a pick up order, and the care and consideration put into making sure the Pho is at quality by the time the customer brings it home to eat is apparent. Thank you so much for giving me a great location to get my pandemic Pho fix!<//Text>< rating>

The shrimp egg rolls and regular egg rolls are spectacular. I had the beef with lemongrass and chili spice and it was tasty, but I felt as though I didnt get my money's worth. Overall the quality is decent, but not the best Pho place by far.<//Text><username>Clifford Norton< /username><time>1515617939552<//time><resp>None</resp><user_id>101348829624851510556<//user_id>< pics>

<Text>My favorite Pho place ever! The noodles, broth and the love put into the food set this place apart from everywhere else. Everything I've eaten has been excellent. The staff  always remember me and my family and they are so kind and happy even with the language barrier at times. I love this place  and recommend it to all my family and friends. They treat you like family and you always leave happy. Also the Vietnamese coffee is incredible..< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None<//Response><Gmap_id>0x80dc7433affc2443:0xe7d578d30fbb382</Gmap_id></record>

Nice little place that seems to be ran by a family. Very nice people and the service was good. The pho broth wasn't the best I ever tasted, but the service and the overall food quality was great. I felt at home eating here. Eat pho here and lift your mood for free.  I definitely will come back.<//Review>

<text>Straight up FALSE ADVERTISING. Ordered food over the phone, when I got there the price was nearly DOUBLE what it should have been..  like 6.50 for the egg rolls that say 3.50 on the website.  I asked why and they said they need to update their website, but it's been the new prices for "a very long time".... That's FALSE advertising, unethical, and I think illegal.  To top it off, I got home to find the "extra large pho special" had 3 slices of steak, zero flank, zero tendon, zero tripe despite the menu saying it would have all of those.  Again with the lying.  Super frustrating.< /text>< Pics>

I’m AMAZED by Tasty Pho! I rarely write reviews but right now I’m still in the corner booth at the restaurant writing this because the pho is off the hook!!! I’ve eaten a lot of pho all over the world and Tasty Pho in vista ranks in the top five of my list... The broth is what makes the pho so good. Run, go here, eat and let your palate delight in Vietnamese splendor 😍🎉</review>

Tiny place, mostly to go orders but a few table tip easy there. Reasonable prices. Bbq chicken spring rolls had some griddle and hard pieces, wouldn't recommend. But the stir fry and the soup are good. All broth had msg except the vegetarian.<//Text>

I’m rating one star because I can’t rate any less. I ordered a seafood pho and I KNOW seafood pho and the seafood in there was questionable. I asked the server and she said it was IMITATION SEAFOOD with food coloring.What the PHO?! They should state that on the menu!!! That’s why people get cancer and thyroid disease due to eating IMITATION FOOD (amongst other things)IMITATION SQUID IS MADE OUT PIG RECTUM AND INTESTINE. Never going here again.<//text>

I came here during lunch on a Friday. Not very busy. Its small here. 3 booths and 5 tables. Other than pho, they also have Banh Mi, rice entrees, vermicelli, and various boba drinks. I always get pho tai (rare steak) when I hit up vietnamese spots. The pho tai here is pretty good. I got the large which seemed a bit smaller than im used to. The prices seem fair and the service is good. FYI they charge $0.50 if you use a cc for purchases below $5.

Overall good pho with expected price and service. I'll come back when I'm in the area and I'm craving pho.< /Text>

In the waiting room I didn’t wait much, neither for the nurse to go in to take vitals. For the doctor however, I waited about 45 minutes for her to go into the room. They ended up washing out the wax from her ear which she was having pain on. She was then checked again for possible ear infection but Dr told me she didn’t have any. No medication was prescribed. After 2 more days of having fever I took her to another clinic outside Clinicas and the doctor there told me she did have a little bit of ear infection as well as some bleeding of the eardrum probably because of the ear wash. There she was prescribed medication. I’m just not sure why I was told at Clinicas that she had no ear infection when she did.< /Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

<review>The staff and doctors have always been very nice and my appointments are always soon....<//review></record>
</dataset><record>
<Name>Pat King< /Name><Review>First let me say that I DO NOT write a lot of reviews, coming from a marketing background I know how badly negative reviews can impact a business and in many cases 1 review/experience is not a realistic snapshot of a business. Everyone has a  bad day and nobody is perfect.

That being said, my experience with this Clinic overall in several experiences is the ABSOLUTE WORST I have had in 25 years dealing with many medical issues.

I have recently relocated to this area and was in desperate need of finding a doctor to treat ongoing chronic health issues. This place was sadly recommended.

Here is a summary of my experience.

-The staff in general is very friendly in all interactions. This is not a cut on them by any means.

-Sharing my health history and what medications that have worked for me was a complete waste of time. I even offered a copy of my medical records that confirm my history. Instead of prescribing me what I had used that was working for me, they unknowingly prescribed me something I never heard of. I didn't know until I went to the pharmacy to pick it up. I was a little confused, but kept an open mind and took the medication anyway.

However, the medication made me very ill. So I called them to see if they could switch my prescription to the other medication that I had been taking. They confirmed that they sent the new prescription to the pharmacy. Upon going to pick it up, I find out that its OTC medication that I had already told them didn't work for me during the visit. I didn't pick up the medication and instead called them yet again and was clear on what I had been prescribed and what didn't work for me. At this point, they made me come in and give urine for an unknown test. They  never even told me what they were testing me for (I can only assume it was a drug test, which I don't care because I do not use any kind of narcotics and certainly wasn't seeking any. After the test, I had to go back to the pharmacy yet again only to find out that they sent the wrong prescription and not properly prescribed which was caught by the pharmacist. 5 more phone calls from me and 2 calls from the pharmacy all while Im there waiting and 5 hours later, I finally got the right medication only after they sent it to a completely different pharmacy that I had never used, in a town where I have never lived. They had my pharmacy on file and had already sent me multiple medications there.

So multiple times they prescribed me something that I wasn't aware of, they were oddly secretive about telling me and let me find out what I went to the pharmacy. ??????

They made me come back to the office to give a urine sample for some kind of test that they never even disclosed to me.

Kept me at the pharmacy for 5 hours and many calls back and forth to finally get my 1 very simple prescription filled. They were unapologetic, very standoffish and not concerned at all with quality customer service or ensuring that I am being properly treated for a serious chronic health condition.

I don't know if the mystery with the different medications is related to prescribing something that they get kick backs for or what. It's all very odd and something I have never experienced. This could all perhaps be a direct result of the physician assistant's incompetence. His name was Mr. White. As I stated, the rest of the staff was very nice and friendly.

Lastly, I asked to have my blood pressure medication filled multiple times and after all this I am still without my blood pressure meds which is not good. How many more hoops would I have to jump through to get another medication? One that is potentially life threatening.....??????

The support staff on the phone at the main office should get some customer service training, learn some compassion and how to come across understanding to the customer (even if they don't understand or agree, fake it).

I will NEVER go back here. Id rather sit in an emergency room all day.</Review><date>1548721526421< /date>< user_id>

(Translated by Google) They dumped me twice with a very important appointment in two weeks, those with young children and only one job understand how hard it is to make space for them to attend to it, dr. Padilla is very busy. It's a shame that they put me aside. I also have a health problem and if he doesn't take care of me, what should I do? I hope they are more humane with their actions, the receptionist who attended us never offered a proper apology.

(Original)
Me dejaron dos veces plantado con una cita muy importante en dos semanas, los que tiene niños pequeños y un solo trabajo entienden lo duro que es hacer espacio para que lo atiendan, la dr. Padilla está muy ocupada es una pena que me hagan a un lado yo también tengo un problema de salud y si no me atiende que es lo que debo de hacer? Espero sean más humanos con sus actos, la recepcionista que nos atendió jamás ofreció una disculpa apropiada.<//Text>

OMG. Must try their fire bird chicken sandwich. Mac and cheese was so delicious along with their slaw. But if you’re gonna try one thing along with your fire bird sandwich. It’s the honey butter dip with their biscuits. I died and left a new man.<//review>

Wasn't sure what to expect and was simply blown away. Every single part of the meal was delicious. Chicken was very flavor, waffle fries had a fresh taste to it, mashed potatoes were very tasty, and biscuit were definitely an expected surprise. There was no lull in the meal and every single items shined.<//review>

This place is right in the middle of USC village. Seating is very limited but the staff is very efficient in getting customers through the line with their food orders. My favorite is the Fire bird chicken sandwich pictured below. Waffle fries are separate or sold in a combo.<//review>

This place is good. I love to eat so One of my favorites in LA. The spicy chicken sandwich, the chicken, bacon and egg breakfast sandwich and the strawberry doughnuts are my absolute favorites. They're open for pickup during quarantine and the food travels well (isn't soggy or gross by the time you get home).</text>

Ordered a Spicy Sandwich and waffle fries with BBQ sauce. It was 17 with tax and was well worth the price as the BBQ sauce is very good and the portions are fairly large. The sandwich was pretty spicy but overall very good. The cashier was nice and the service was good as well.< /review>

They're crispy chicken sandwich was good, nothing to excellent but still had enough flavor to satisfy me for the day. The chicken sandwich had coleslaw, tomatoes, this orange sauce, and pickles. I also had a side of fries which were extremely crunchy and well-seasoned.<//text>

< Review>
I've come here a few times. I've had the chicken and waffles, the combo meal and the spicy chicken sandwich. All of them were delicious, crispy, and juicy, but I think my favorite was definitely the sandwich. I also got a side of Mac n cheese which was quite good. Absolutely one of the best places in the USC Village next to Cava and Il Giardino.< /Review>

<Text>i had high hopes but it was kinda meh.  i dunno.  maybe i got the wrong thing but i got about halfway through and it was obvious the chicken wasn’t fully cooked.

i should have told the front but i was in a rush and figured i could cook it all the way later via oven, microwave or even the deep fryer in my truck.

might try it again.  nice people, service was fine but the undercooked thing kinda killed it for me.</Text></record>

Amazing flavor when it comes to there chicken, uhh wow collared greens with bacon, also there bacon and chives biscuit is so good i had to by more then one.  Lets not also for get the amazing home made pies, like banana pie, orange pie, chocolate pie,  salted pie, pecan pie. Im differently coming back with my friend's and family,  thank you honeybird for changing the game when it comes down to southern fried soulfood cooking.</review>

I got my citizenship paperwork through these people
Honest.. reliable..down to earth
Don't hype stuff or scare people & overcharge like a couple places I had gone to prior to this place.. I everything was clear prices didn't change throughout the whole process
The time it took was about the time they told me even though it was an estimate
They tell you ahead of time what to expect. During the process I have seen several other customers step in to office and thank them & are very grateful
That to me says a whole alot.
Now were working on another case & again everything is running as they said it would
The office seems so unassuming
But Great work is done inside
God Bless them</review>

<review>I went there because the IRS recommended it for a tax issue. I cannot remember ever being treated as badly as I was by this place . I had a appointment,  arrived on time given a paper to fill out and proceeded to wait over 2 hours, other people came were helped and left, no one ever said a word to me. This was a spanish speaking office, and I look Caucasian but was raised by my Hispanic grandparents and understood everything that was said,  and apparently they had no intention of helping me. I finally asked when I would be helped and a woman in the office said something about a privileged white ! $$!# grabbed the paper I filled out, went in a back room and never came back.  If you are not obviously a Spanish speaking Hispanic stay far far away from these horrible people!<//review>< Pictures>

<text>The pad Thai here is good but they curries are not very good. There is literally no vegetables in them. The yellow curry comes with 1 potato and a few measly green and red peppers. I have to order half rice, half vegetables just so there is something to put in the curry. A curry should be full of veggies and meat!<//text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

The prices are good and the food is OK. Wish the pad thai had more flavor. Definitely needs more work overall. There's better Thai places in the area.< /review>

This place had a really great aesthetic to it and outdoorsy vibes, loved it. Except for the fact that you couldn’t dine in because of Covid restrictions. The girl that worked there recommended some really good and popular foods that locals buy and I got a pho soup with shrimp because I was craving a little seafood that was spicy but what I didn’t like is that it was sweet spicy and I didn’t like the sweet in it but other than that, the pho was phenomenal and had a exceptional flavor to it</review>

<text>When this placed first opened up in PB it was my favorite place to eat. However I feel like it has slowly started to go downhill. My favorite things to order are the green and yellow curry and the last time I ordered them it literally came with no vegetables, just meat in curry sauce with rice. The curry used to be filled with vegetables along with the meat. What happened??< /text>< pics>

Pass on this place, the fried rice came out mushy and pretty tasteless and the fried chicken I am quite sure were chicken gizzards. I also order the spring rolls and they  were tastlesd with thick wrappings.</text>

Solid, inexpensive Thai food. Good quality for value. Go at a less busier time (lunch on weekdays) and you’ll get a better taste.

Wait times can be on the long side Thursday and Friday evenings. The canteen style makes it pretty loud when busy.< /text>

Was looking for a quick, delicious spot to fulfill our craving for Thai food and 55 Thai Kitchen definitely scratched that itch. The Pad See Eew and Pad Thai were both spicy Hot as ordered and the delivery was quick.

Thank you!<//Review>

Great addition to PB. Even with a number of existing Thai restaurants, this is a much-needed replacement for the sad diner that once resided here.

The open air and bright location is welcoming, but my review is only based on a takeout experience, so I can’t speak to dining in. I ordered online for pickup at a future time and the experience was seamless. One of the easiest online ordering interfaces I’ve used and a 15% discount for first-time users.

Initially I was surprised at the reasonable prices, wondering if quality would underwhelm or if portion sizes were small. My food was ready right on time and had definitely not been sitting around for awhile. You can skip the line at the register and the lady at the counter helped me immediately.

My initial concerns vanished before taking the first bite. The food smelled great, portions were substantial, and looked fresh. First bite corroborated reviews from the other locations - it’s delicious. I had the massaman curry with rice and veggies and it was scrumptious. My only qualm is that I wanted it spicy but it was extremely mild. Aside from a weak spice level, the chicken was excellent and curry was very flavorful. My friend ordered the drunken noodle which was equally fresh and delicious.

This is definitely going into my regular takeout rotation. Glad to see this block of Garnet gain another restaurant and I hope it can be successful. It was crowded on a Wednesday evening.</review>

<text>We have been trying to get it together to try this new place for a couple of weeks (since the publicity in PB Mag). But I have to tell you that my wife and I were disappointed and will probably not be back. Actually, there were 4 of us and none of us liked it. My son had chicken rosemary I think, but the Spicy Basel Chicken was indeed minced as the menu warned but looked like hamburger. It tasted okay but looked like hell. Thai tea was weird and so was lime aid. Two other dishes were a bust, shrimp Pad Thai had 5 shrimp and was too sweet. Massaman Curry Chicken (a house specialty) was tasty but they forget to put it into the microwave so it was cold. Too bad.<//text><name>Kirk Dickinson</name>< userid>

<review>Decided to give this new establishment a try for dinner tonight. I ordered the yellow curry with tofu, veggies and white rice while my partner ordered the number 25. Some fried meat dish with rice that came with a side bowl of broth. The food was excellent and I also ordered a Thai Iced Tea that was excellent. Their cups, cutlery, and containers say that they are compostable but we were eating in and would have appreciated reducing unnecessary waste (compostable or not) by utilizing restaurant owned dishes. We got something for our almost 2 year old from the kid's menu and the portion was a good size for the price. Bonus: our son loved his massaman chicken curry. I hope the owner reads this and takes note that neither restroom has a changing table for kids/babies and it's SO annoying. I know changing tables are only required in federal buildings but if new businesses want to promote community and family, then accomodations for families and community must be considered. Please consider installing changing tables in BOTH restrooms so families aren't forced out to their cars when a diaper change becomes necessary.< /review>< Pics>

Bruh... $ 5 delivery fee.  Each topping + $ 2.75 + tip.  As a result, you will take overcook pizza in Hollywood  for $ 40 +1hr delivery waiting time + will not receive any discount on the first order. This is my first and last order. Do not recommend.</text>

My son who loves Wingstop enjoyed their baked wings. They have vegan and keto options. The greek salad and sausage, artichoke, pesto pizza were delicious. There are two dine-in tables that can be used. The cashier was friendly, courteous, and attentive to the customers.< /text>

Wow. I try not to leave bad reviews, but the service here is TERRIBLE. I ordered a personal pan pizza, and what was supposed to take 15 minutes took OVER 40 minutes. No one had any idea what was going on. I cannot believe how slow and how poorly they conduct business. This is the second time I have experienced this here.<//text>

<Review>Soooooo...I wanted pizza with my salad and boom found a billboard for Fresh Brothers. Reminded me of Marco's Pizza although the crust at Fresh Brothers is much better... In an Italiano way...thinner and more flavorful. Mmmm mmm gooders I say. Price was $16 for a medium but hey that's L.A. Met my needs and pretty good pizza even the 2nd day in the oven. Marco's please take note because the crust separates from the cheese after the 2nd day instead of holding it all together when eating like Fresh Brothers. One bite and it certainly screams, Fresh!!! Read the top..truth behind the carton box. Dude franchise to Texas... I am my brother's pizza keeper.🤪 Ayyyyeee!<//Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPq1p6I0fXtLQgj2NQ9PEZTEKavlEdlUe53q9YY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNIHSEumr2zK-hPXXztYVP7JrURBuafK_33EPFk=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics>< Resp>

<text>I've been ordering from Fresh Brothers in Hollywood for a few years now, ever since I moved into the neighborhood, and I've noticed a decline in both quality and service.

Several months ago, I ordered a cauliflower crust pizza for delivery. The delivery time was about average, however the pizza was burnt. It was late evening on the weekend, so I didn't bother to reorder.

Just today, I received an email promotion to try their newest pizza. When I tried to order online, I wasn't able to complete the transaction. When I called the shop and explained the situation, I was told that the order did not meet the minimum requirement for delivery, because the coupon code from their email special discounted the total amount to be below the minimum. I asked if they would be able to override this and allow me to order for delivery since the order did exceed the minimum requirement before the coupon, and they said no.

So, long story short, I did not order the pizza. And they did not offer up any other solution. They literally told me that the order did not meet the minimum for delivery, and that was it. With the number of other options in the Hollywood area, I will not be ordering from Fresh Brothers again, nor will I recommend them.

Fresh Brothers, I encourage you to think about your service model from a customer's perspective, and see the experience through their eyes. I also recommend that you consider adding language to both your website and your email promotions, that clearly communicates any such disclaimers.</text><pictures>None</pictures><Response>{'time': 1565624482840, 'text': "Adam, we are very sorry that your experiences haven't been positive and would welcome the ability to see what we could do for you. It's discouraging that your pizza wasn't cooked right and that you were unable to order what you requested. To see what solutions would be possible, please send an email to our district manager, Ben, at BenC@freshbrothers.com. Thank you."}< /Response>< Gmap_id>

<Review>I love Fresh Brothers!! Their dough is super fresh and they toss the pizza right in front of you. My pizza was done in under 5 minutes and was delicious. Very friendly staff and the environment was very family-oriented. Pizza was very generously sized and could feed at least 2 people. I highly recommend going here with friends or family!!<//Review></record></dataset><record>

<review>Omg I wish it was closer to home.  I would be here twice a week.  The chicken wings are excellent, we had the habanero  and lemon pepper, both were delicious. Dear owners, please open a location in San Diego. This place is kinda out of the way and a hole in the wall but as the sign reads they are expanding the restaurant.< /review>< Pictures>

Yummy and lots of options for those with dietary restrictions. (Love the vegan ranch! And they have vegan impossible meat and vegan cheese, too! Cauliflower crust does contain eggs, though, FYI)
Just make sure to check your order before you walk out... Have had a couple of forgotten toppings from time to time!<//Review>

This is the worst pizza I have ever eaten. It genuinely is like someone put cheese on wet cardboard. I've had Chuck E Cheese pizza taste better than this. Disappointed.<//Text>

Fresh toppings(including fresh spinach!) and delicious homemade sauce from Fresh Brothers. I’ve gotten delicious food every time I ordered from here(try the Chicago style with toppings inside the middle crust). It’s consistently the best delivered pizza in town.</Text>

<Review>I'd never heard of Fresh Brothers before I moved to LA, but after living here for a while I've learned to really love their pizza. It's a great option if you are vegan, they make a great vegan cheese and vegan sausage pizza. They're regular pizza is very delicious too. They have great ingredients and the cut their pizza into squares and not a pie cut which reminds me of great pizza in Chicago. Fresh brothers is one of my favorite pizza chains now mainly because they have so many selections to choose from. It can be a little pricey but for the pizza they serve I would much rather choose fresh brothers over domino's or papa John's.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

<text>VEGAN PIZZA! I’m shifting away from all dairy and meat but was still craving pizza. My cheese pizza with vegan sausage did NOT disappoint. And a cauli crust?!! Om nom nom nom. There are no photos because it was just that good. I love that I can satisfy my pizza cravings and satisfy my new dietary needs. Fresh Bros for life!< /text>< Pictures>

<Review>They are right down the street from where I live.  The store has seating and lots of TVs on their walls.  The food is excellent and the service is too.  They have awesome internet specials all the time.  On Monday, the Internet offering was a deep dish Chicago pizza  (my favorite) for $10.  and I am from Chicago!)  The pizza was delicious, but there was a problem.  The paper that the pizza sits on in the box was stuck to the pizza.  It was difficult to lift a piece off of it (it felt like it was glued to it) and when it finally lifted free, some of the pizza was stuck to the paper and/or the paper was stuck to the bottom of the pizza and had to be scraped off.  I wrote them to let them know and it is only reason why they did not get 5 stars.< /Review>< userid>

<rate>5</rate><Text>I love their vegan pizza and their very close to my apartment in Hollywood so the delivery time was less the 25 mins.

When I orderd my favorite vegan cheese pizza with vegan sausage. I forgot to be more specific about the sausage being vegan, and  the pizza came with real sausage, and though it was my mistake for not being more specific they fixed my order and sent the whole order with vegan sausage in less than the original delivery time.  The manager was so sweet, and the delivery driver was so nice even though he had to make a double trip to my house.

If your looking for vegan eats with great service, Fresh Brothers is the way to go.<//Text>< Pics>

Fresh Brothers understands the meaning of customer service and quality. Let me take you to the experience I was blessed with. I strolled into Fresh Brothers on a whim of hunger. After being greeted by the front counter representative, he politely suggested options for me to try. After placing the order, it seemed that the food materialized in front of me. The swift nature of presenting the food to us was outstanding. Then after the first bite it seemed that a little piece of heaven was bestowed upon me. The fresh taste of their all natural mozzerlla soared through my taste buds and I couldn't help but let out a satisfactory groan. And just as fast as the pizza appeared, it was gone.
Through and through, I highly recommend this experience to anyone. Thanks Fresh Brothers.<//text>

Amazing! We were looking for a gluten free pizza place for my wife and extended family.  I've never eaten here before but it didn't disappoint.  We had several different kinds of pizza, all gluten free and they were really tasty.  The gluten free chicken bites with sweet chili dipping sauce were a hit too.  Our picky 10 year old was happy too.< /Review>

I came here cause I saw the billboard for the vegan sliders and I wanted them I was super hungry when I got here so you would think they would taste amazing but the tasted overly salted and were like $13 I also got the half lb of vegan tenders that were $12 and they literally brought me out some gardein frozen long chicken nuggets. Disgusting they we're so dry and gross. And the girl that helped me out was so rude. Didn't even smile. Sounded rude when I asked her about things on the menu. Grow up this is your job act right at work!< /review>

"Fresh Brothers" says it all.
You'll taste the difference in every bite.
There's no skimping on the toppings either. Their  Pizza is probably the best I've ever tasted anywhere else, there's no comparison.</review>

This is a totally awesome place!  I ordered 250 pizzas for a special event and they were fantastic quality and I had a lot of people commenting how good they were.  Sometimes the quality goes down when a large amount of pizza is made but not with Fresh Brother's, they're the bomb!!  Thank you!!!<//review>

<text>I recently ordered a vegan pizza from the West Hollywood/Bronson Fresh Brothers location but to my surprise, not only did the chef making the pizza NOT wear gloves, the girl making the salads was strangely wearing only one glove on her left hand, all the while answering the dirty phone, using the register and handling dirty money with the same hand (see pic attached).  It was so disgusting and unsanitary. Super disappointing because their vegan pizza is really good but after seeing the unsanitary conditions, I doubt I'd be back.</text><pictures>None<//pictures>< gmap_id>

<Review>The pizza here is so good unlike from any other joint...I'd label it Gourmet Pizza. I always get the triple pepperoni with extra pizza sauce. In fact I only had an issue one time with delivery but the manager Jordan made good on it and it was very fast and prompt. So when Jordan is working, you can count on your order being fulfilled with exceptional service..... Munga Munga</Review>< Pictures>

Wow! Vegan pizzas and desserts!! Daiya cheese. Medium pizza $14-$20, swt knots $3, brownie $3. Yelp check in to get 3 free sweet knots.

Located in/back of Franklin Village.
Pizza, salad, and fun sides like wings, knots, boneless bites and fries.

Friendly staff.
Private parking lot.</Review>

At first see all the ratings,  (can it really be that great) but now after testing this place out i can definitely say 5 stars is still not enough.This place is amazing. The second you walk they treat you like family. They have a Wonderful staff. James is the most friendliest person you can ever meet, he changes the whole environment. It was our first time here, and trust me, it wont be the last. We order a deep dish pizza with pepperoni, pineapples and jalapeños. My wife wasn't too excited about the deep dish because she doesn't like to much dough, but now you can definitely say that Fresh brothers converted her to a deep dish lover haha. The dough is so light and delicious it was honestly too perfect, everyone has to try it. And definitely don't forget about dessert, sadly i don't remember what it was called but it was these cinnamon knots. So delicious.We will definitely recommend to all friends and family.  Thank you so much for the great experience 🍕💑⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

<Text>My friend invited my over to Fresh Brothers Pizza last night and we had a blast! There were about 10 of us and it was a great way to catch up with old friends, meet new people and eat LOTS AND LOTS OF PIZZA!

I would like to thank Debbie Goldberg for being the hostess with the mostess! She made sure that our drinks were always full and most importantly she made sure that our rather large party had plenty to eat.

Mission Accomplished!!  It has been 12 hours since I ate any food and I am still in a Pizza Coma!

So lets talk about the Fresh Brothers location itself. It is Hollywood so there is a lot of traffic and the spots in the parking lot go quickly. I rode my bike so I was able to park right in front.

This place has a lot of tv's. When I was done counting them, I found two more in the bathroom so I think the total is like 15 flatscreens for a pretty small location. I thought it was awesome! They have two tv's that point outside so you can watch tv if you are standing in front of the building.. Even more awesome!

The food was awesome. Let me take you through what I ate:

We had the fresh knots and wings. The knots were very good and they are described like this. Garlic bread tied in tasty knots, dusted with parmesan, pizza sauce on the side

After the appetizers came out, then came out the salads. I dove into the BBQ Chicken Salad  and it was very yummy. It was very fresh and here are the ingredients for that. Barbecued chicken breast over a tasty bed of romaine, cheddar cheese, corn, zesty onions and black beans topped with fried onions.

The final course was the pizzas and there was plenty to go around. To be honest, I don't know how many kinds of pizza's were out there but they were all called. My friend Dimple has a custom pizza made for her which has Sausage, Pepperoni and Red Onions on it. I think I might have liked it the best. I hope to see the Dimple Special on the menu sometime soon..

The Bottom Line: The food here is awesome and they have 10 locations throughout Los Angeles. I would recommend trying any of them!</Text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None<//response>< Gmap_id>

Nice and clean place, good food. Shvarma in Turkish bread is definitely something to try. Sometime we order chicken diner to go, come with two large sides and pitas. Whole chicken with sides for $8? Isn't that a Deal?<//review>

<review>Super grateful for this high quality deli with hot food and salad bar options. I love filling up a big plate with brown rice, seasoned tofu, butternut squash, sauteed kale, brussel sprouts, and mashed potatoes. Top it off with a side salad and you've got yourself a healthy, hearty lunch.< /review>< Pictures>

Wildflower is cafeteria style casual with no service per se'.  The food is VERY fresh and made everyday since the restaurant is open only 4 hours per day.  There is a combination of cooked food along with a salad bar, and a wide selection of healthy choices for vegans like me.  As already noted, you are charged by the weight so it is possible to be surprised when you get to the cashier after piling a takeout style box high with food.<//Review>

<Review>Healthy food with a Korean American leaning.
Lean in to Wildflower Cafe. It's no nonsense & you get really delicious, healthy food.
Isn't it typically difficult to find any of these characteristics at an eaterie?
Not @ Wildflower cafe.
I recall the son of the owner working here. He was a lean, good-looking young man. He didn't want a cafe serving unhealthy food. He was an athlete.
The owners made a whole lot of fresh foods; some hot, some cold. Delicious dishes like: seaweed salad, buckwheat soba noodles with veggies, marinated tofu, steamed kale salad (my favorite!) and a whole lot of protein options like cold fresh turkey, baked chicken, beef meat balls, etc.
Feeling tired or stressed? Eat better! Get your food at Wildflower Cafe.
They're at the top of the "fresh" list for sure.</Review>< pictures>

<Response>None</Response><text>This place has a fantastic food bar that features fresh and premade salads along with assorted Asian dishes.  The following are my favorite dishes:

1. Korean Glass Noodles (Chop Chae)
2. Bean Sprout Salad
3. Cucumbers in spicy paste
4. Brown rice salad
5. Chef's Special Chicken

Chef's Special Chicken alone is worth the trip, but all the dishes are terrific.<//text><userid>113799673109447693659</userid>< Name>

If you want a Whole Foods style salad bar downtown, this is the place. Lots of other healthy options for lunch but none where you can build your own on a real deal salad bar like this...< /Text>

FiDi salad bar with a wide selection of hot and cold food items. My favorites are the chef's special spicy chicken, brown rice, japchae, caprese salad, and brussels sprouts. Keep watch of how much you add to your plate though - everything adds up quickly and can easily reach $10+ if you get heftier items like the hot foods!</review>

I would describe it as good cafeteria food. Service is non existant and the atmosphere is cafeteria. The cost of the food is by weight so if you order the right things it can be a good deal.< /Text>

< Review>
This is a pay-per-pound kind of place.
Food is neither good nor bad, nothing special.
It may be a good choice if you're on diet as you can pick as little as you need.
There is no service so you can get in and out in a few minutes.</Review>

<review>Let me just start off by saying i have never been treated with so much respect than this place in any type of sale, very professional great customer support was very helpful on the phone and patient with me even though I called 3 times in one day with questions he worked his butt off to get me financed for my dream truck with no credit history! I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for an amazing deal. Very knowledgeable and patient if you’re new to the buying process as I was. would rate this 10 stars if I could.<//review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

<text>My experience with Malkanis Motors was fantastic. They got me into my dream car and we're more than understanding when my loan took longer than expected.

I dealt personally with Ahsan, President of Malkanis Motors, to buy a used car I fell in love with. Ahsan was easy to work with and went out of his way to help me get the car, when it might have been easier to wait for another buyer to come along (these cars are in high demand). He was honest and straightforward about the price, any defects in the condition of the car, easy to talk to and negotiate with, and he made concessions to help me complete a particularly difficult purchase.

For context: I am an out-of-state buyer with a credit report that technically showed 2 open loans (a refinance and a total loss on the same vehicle, all pending closure). He made every effort to work out financing, he worked with me on the down payment, and he even threw in free delivery to my doorstep. I am a savvy buyer (and naturally skeptical of non-franchise dealerships) who had a difficult purchasing situation, but Ahsan made it happen and inspired trust.

I recommend to anyone that you shop for your next car at Malkanis Motors!< /text>

<Text>This was the most painless car buying experience I have ever had. I got the car that I wanted and was financed at a very reasonable interest rate. The whole process took less than an hour.

<review>I expected my first car buying experience to be stressful, but I was completely wrong. Saw a car listed online that I was interested in so I reached out wanting more info. Someone reached out to me within 30 minutes. I spoke to Ahsan and we were able to work out a deal that worked for the both of us. I was not able to come in the day I reached out nor the next but he assured me that he’d hold onto the car for me for a day that I could come in. Sure enough, I get there and the car was there. I test drove it, no problems at all. Went to do paperwork right after and we were in and out within 45 minutes. Quick, easy, and painless. 10/10 recommended, ask for Ahsan!< /review>< Pictures>

<Review>This was the best car buying experience ever. Ahsan was extremely informative and helpful. He never harassed or pressured me. I am an extremely cautious buyer and like doing my due diligence when making big decisions. Ahsan let me take my time and thoroughly inspect the car and provided any information I needed. I felt like he truly wanted me to be happy with the car and even gave me great advice. As a first time buyer, I was very fortunate to find my car at Ahsan’s dealership.  Definitely recommended. Thank you Ahsan!<//Review>< pictures>

Malkanis motors saved me after my car got stolen. Malkanis motors was able to get me approved for a really nice Volkswagen Jetta SE STI. I love the car. It’s in great condition. This was my fist but and it was a great experience. The customer service was outstanding. If not for them I’d be without a car and a means of making a living. Thank you !!< /review>

I was looking for a car after mine just recently got totaled and I came across a beautiful Dodge Charger for an amazing price. I met with Ahsan, he let me take the car for a test drive and right away he knew that I wanted that car very badly and, without any hassle at all, he made that possible! He was extremely helpful and honest, as so were his employees. Very kind and easy going. Buying the car was very fast and easy. I was able to get the paperwork done and get the car in less than 2 hours! Like I was saying earlier, Ahsan knew I wanted the car and he was more than determined to get those keys in my hands! My buying experience here was amazing and fast! He helped me through every step of the way. Very knowledgeable and friendly. I would definitely recommend buying a car from his dealership!<//Text>

Bought a Toyota RAV4 sport and the service was amazing. I was in and out of the dealership within an hour. The owner was very helpful and provided all the information I needed, would highly recommend! And the prices cannot be beat<//Review>

<text>Wonderful experience and great deal! My sister was looking for a car as a graduation gift for her grandson. So we go online and find this low mileage 2017 Ford Escape SE for a very reasonable price. I kicked out and email to ask if the car was still available. I was surprised to get a response back after a few minutes. So we called right away to see if we could schedule to see it the next day. Ahsan answered and I asked if I could see the car this evening, because it was on my way home, and he said he would wait for me. Mind you it's already after 8 pm. Over an hour later I'm there and and we go out to view the car and the first thing he says is, "I have to let you know that their is a salvage title on this vehicle". It did not post properly to Carmax. I knew it was too good to be true, right? Wrong. Well, turns out the car was hit from the passenger side and there was no damage to the frame. Both doors on that side were replaced and the car look almost like new, except for a few minor scratches. I have to compliment Ahsan for his honesty, and integrity. There were several calls for this car, and he honored our agreement, without me putting any money down. The next day my sister came to buy the car and they were literally getting calls for it while we were filling out the paperwork. Was that you? It was an exceptional deal and we are very satisfied with our purchase. Would not hesitate to buy from Malkanis Motors again.</text>< Rating>

I was looking for 2016 - 2018 Nissan Maxima and noticed a listing on cargurus for a beautiful 2017 with low miles.  I contacted dealership and received a response from Ahsan Siddiqui almost immediately.  I made arrangements to see the car and two days later was very pleased to see the car was much more impressive then the photos showed.   I test drove the car and knew I wanted it but needed to arrange financing with the bank. Upon a handshake, Mr. Siddiqui gave me his word he would hold the car as long as necessary for me to arrange financing.  He required no money down to hold car, only my word and another handshake, that I would let him know if I changed my mind.  This impressed me even more and knew I was going to do business with Mr. Siddiqui.  During the financing paperwork with my bank, I needed an out the door price, Mr. Siddiqui was not in his office but assured me he would get me the final amount within minutes.  True to his word, he sent me the final sale amount.  This was BY FAR the best experience buying a car. So much so that mom, who was with me every step of the way, will also be working with Mr. Siddiqui when she's ready to purchase a vehicle.</Text>

The decor inside was really cool. The music was loud (maybe it was so that when it was really busy it would be backround music. But it was just us 2 and we couldn't hear each other speak.

They do take your card before you order and hold it the entire time.

I couldn't decide what to get so I eventually just decided on chicken tenders, so I wasn't expecting much. But the waitress said "ooh, good choice!" So that got my hopes up. They turned out to be the worst chicken tenders from a Mexican restaurant that I've ever had. So dry and pretty sure they were burned.

My husband's brunch meal looked good and was super big though.

If I ever come back, I'll go to the other restaurant by the beach.</Text>

I went here for dinner I found out it was just too much going on it was nice that they had the outside dining area but you had to take a picture of yourself before you go in and show your ID which was just a little bit too much then when we got there is a Mexican restaurants normally when you go to Mexican restaurants you get free chips and dip and salsa but they want to charge you for every little thing and the chips were stale and I think I paid like $5 for it and I'll just thought that was just a little bit too much for still chips and salsa then they ordered the chicken for I ordered the fajita plate and the fluffy is were good not a lot barely enough for one person they said they had guacamole cheese and sour cream on the side which is like a teaspoon and I asked them that they have guacamole with the meal they told me no but then I so I ordered more guacamole 10 bucks and I was like that's just too much when I got it they had guacamole on the plate yes a teaspoon but it was still guacamole on the plate and then it was just so much stress I didn't enjoy the dining experience at all and end up spending $80 on a meal that should have cost me $10 but I paid and I will never go back there again and thank you for the not good service< /text>

This place was great! Great hospitality! Good prices on drinks and good food. We made it out to Cabo twice. Security took care of the Texas girls 😁<//text>

Security guy at the gate of outdoor dining threatened to pop me in the mouth for not having a mask when I went to grab my bag at my table 2 feet away that had my mask. Unprofessional and completely inappropriate.< /Review>

I had the WORSE experience here on 5/5/2021. Our initial waiter was amazing, but it was time for him to clock out and and a new waitress “Heather” was supposed to take over our table. We already ordered our first drink and appetizer, however we were ready to order our actual meal. We waited for 30 mins (we watched her go to every table but ours). Eventually I got tired of waiting and went looking for the manger. I spoke to the manger “Guy” he was VERY nonchalant and had no urgency to help. About five minutes later Heather finally made her way to our table rolled her eyes and said are “you ready to order.”  We kindly said yes and mentioned we’ve been waiting for quite some time. She looked over and said give me a second THEN WALKED AWAY. Five more minutes pass and she finally takes our order by that time we were frustrated ordered a beer and asked to cash out. I’m extremely taken back by the carelessness of both the manger and our waitress. We were the only black people in that section within the hour of us waiting we watched other customers get seated , fed and taken care of without even a look our way. I’ve been to Cabo plenty of times and never have I felt so unseen and disrespected by the staff. I am disgusted!< /Text>

Really cool and chill place. The Host Jason is really Funny and should be on the entertainment business, from the minute you walk in he engages you and makes you feel welcome and appreciated. And Stephanie our waitress was amazing. It's a must if you come down to Venice Beach.< /Text>

Good food, service was okay. You must give them your driver's license and your info stays in their database for 90 days. Security guards were there too.  Guess they usually have rough crowds. Don't bring your kids here, it's definitely not the right place for family dining.<//review>

Horrible experience! First of all update your hours went to Cabo thinking they closed at 2am turns out they close at midnight. our tabs already cause they close in 5 mins.  I arrived at Cabo around 11:15 pm received my drinks around 11:30/11:35 pm. Our waitress closed our tab 6 mins before 12am okay cool. Then a security guard comes up to my friends and I a min later asking if we closed our tab cause they close at midnight. None the less my drink was still full exactly at 12 they started kicking everyone out! I can’t even sit down and enjoy something I paid for? Highly doubt I’ll be coming back it used to be my favorite bar to kick back.</Text>

This place has good food and drinks but be aware at checkout! Me and my friends were celebrating a birthday and decided to to come to this place and get drinks. We ordered a variety of things so we were a little drunk. We stayed til closing and by the time they had closed out tab. They had charged us multiple Wine bottles, we tried to complain but they just treated us like a bunch of drunks and told us they had already closed... We ended up being charged nearly 40% tip and include 2 wine bottles we never got and food items we never ordered.... They obviously scammed us. Keep in mind we went during their happy hour< /text>

Employees AJ supervisor, and Christopher the new guard gave us a great experience. We got great service, and they constantly checked to make sure we were okay and had everything we needed. Everyone was very friendly and helpful. Food was great, drinks were great. Everytime we come here AJ always keeps things in order.<//review>

Always good. Famous for their bottomless hot fresh made garlic knot rolls. Nothing better than enjoying their delicious food sitting on the patio on a sunny California day.< /Text>

CT, the new guard performed very well and deserves to be hired on as well as a pay raise. AJ  handled a situation with uncooperative customers to the best of his abilities. Both Christopher and AJ handled the Situation as professional as possible and deserve a raise and respect to the max of whoever's authority<//text>

First time at this location and it was great!! The warm weather definitely was appreciated considering how windy and cool it was outside. We went for happy hour (which is only two for one drinks). There are no food specials which kind of sucks because most other places do offer happy hour food specials. The drinks were good and service was great. It’s a nice spot and the people that come there are friendly as well. I would recommend this place.< /text>

the ultimate ice cream experience.

I rarely go for ice cream since it's on the less healthy side of food or desert choices. I regard it as a slow heart attack item.

Nevertheless, gotta go sometime.

Meaning, when in particular company, icecream is a nice added feature presenting cool social benefits.

I mean you can't not share a sample with your date or companion.

Anyway, the cold stone gimmick of mashing and mixing the icecream on the cold stone slab adds to the entertainment of the moment.

And the waffle layout in a dish makes for a total yum experience.

Even if it adds to clogging of arteries and a quicker route to six feet under.< /review>

Yesterday 8/6/19 around noon my friend and I decided to come in and have lunch. My friend is Vegan so we asked the waitress (who I won’t name) if there were any Vegan options, she said that there was none exactly but they could work something up so she suggested grilled veggies taco. We asked questions regarding cross contamination because that is an actual thing. People who are Vegan cannot consume contaminated food because it makes them ill. (Same if a person was allergic) We even asked about the French fries and she was honest about it being fried with oil that has been used for other food but said the veggies are grilled with new oil and on their own so it should be okay and we went with her suggestion(Veggie grilled Tacos). Long story short my friend became ill developed a fever and stomach problems she got very sick after consuming these tacos. I’m just very disappointed and upset because this is down right disrespectful. You need to be aware that there are people who have restrictions to eat certain foods. There are people who like my friend are Vegan and there are people who could have allergies or do to religious beliefs cannot eat certain foods. This is not a joke! If you cannot provide what we or any other person needs, have some integrity!</Review>

The music was very tasteful. The service was good. The atmosphere was awesome. The margaritas were bland. The shrimp tacos & that sauce they place on the side was bomb. Nachos were okay.< /text>

What crooks. If you go there, fine, but make sure they don't steal your money.

My friends and I went for Happy Hour and split the bill at the end. Service was slow, but the people were nice. One of our group members closed out and paid for his tab. When we paid our bill, the bill wasn't itemized and we assumed all was good. The waitress gave us her card and said she was a comedian and said we should check her out. Fine. The next day, when we looked into what we paid to split the bill, it was more expensive than we thought so we called, they said not only did they not subtract our friends bill but also added nachos that we didn't order. We asked to be sent the bill via email along with what our friend paid, which they did. We replied we didn't order or consume the extra charges, but they refused to reimburse us for the extra $20+ charges because we had signed the unitemized receipt from the night before. What crooks. If you go there, fine, but make sure they don't steal your money.</Text>

I gave one start because we were there for about 30 mins and although we spoke with the server, we never got severed. We even asked to another server, who although busy told us she'd get us someone to assist us. No one eventually showed up for more than 15 so we decided to leave. This is really poor service quality.</text>

I mean all you can eat tacos for $7. Why not? We got there at about 8:50 pm waited at the bar to be served and no one paid attention to us until 9:16 pm. When we asked for the taco Tuesday special we were told it ended at 9. We were a little upset by that. But none the less we were hungry so the couple next to us ordered the nachos ( it looked scrumptious) . So we had an order of nachos with steak and their peach margarita with 4 shots to share for $19. The nachos were amazing. The steak juice and seasoned perfectly. Our bartender was hilarious. All in all a great night. I will be back!</Review></record></dataset><record>

<review>If you've just flown in and you're super hungry and thirsty and it's just around the corner from your accomodation, then maybe go here. Chicken wings and nachos are pretty good value for money and a pretty good drinks menu. We were there on a Wednesday, super early and it was already full of drunks!</review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

< Review>
Amazing place for huge margaritas and good music. I went with a few friends on the weekend and had a blast. They even have outdoor fireplaces on the roof so when it gets cold on the beach you can still drink outside. I suggest taking advantage of the taco and burrito specials because that’s what they’re good at. Also ordering one monster margarita should last you the whole meal.</Review>

After a long Saturday on Venice Beach Boardwalk, we decided to take a short 12 min walk to Cabo Cantina for dinner. The walk was stunning! Glass houses to the left,  the sun setting on the beach to the right. Security checked our ID and we were on our own to find seating. All 3 levels were packed to capacity, which were a little discouraging, but we were able to squeeze two stool seats to the fire pit bar for a very beautiful scenic dinner setting. I had to go grab food menus from the back bar, and we waited about 10 mins before a waitress found us to take our order. The music was blaring some of our favorite 90’a jams, so the wait didn’t seem long. The wings that I once ordered at the Hollywood location weren’t on the menu, so I ordered the  chicken sunset rolls with a side of fries and Ari ordered the queso dip (with added shrimp). We shared a raspberry margarita. The sunset rolls melted in my mouth, um um good. The fries were fresh and hot thick wedged. Ari’s queso dip looked like mush and she said it turned her stomach. The margarita was “ok” in taste to me, but Ari said it tasted like medicine. I liked the loud environment, Ari said she didn’t like the people dancing so close to where we ate. 3.5 stars because booth parties should love the venue for 5 stars. I rounded up to 4 stars because I personally liked this place a lot to finish a fun Beach day.< /text>

The margaritas are awful! Not enough alcohol. You only taste the mixer. And the mixers are either too sweet or too sour. And I'm a sugar addict so I like sweet but this is not a good sweet. But their nachos are delicious! And they have a fun atmosphere.< /review>

We are two adults in our 50’s and they wouldn’t take our order without prepaying or holding our cc! Place is a gong show supervisor with long dark hair glasses and Mex tattoo was rude forcefully trying to upsell drinks that had no prices on the menu?? She was arguing with younger staff like out of bar rescue episode. Whole staff vibe felt angry and food was terrible. When we asked for our cc back they would not release it until we payed in cash. Can u say trust issues!!<//text>

<time>1564365625157</time><Rate>1<//Rate><text>100 Percent the ABSOLUTE WORST service I/we have ever had. And this is coming from two server's that understand what it's like to be weeded/behind. We were not greated and had to flag down three different waiters each time we wanted to Order, order another round, ask for our check. And then eventually physically get up, track down our alleged waitress, only to discover she didn't have our check. Then find the other "Waiter" that did. She gave us our check, without a pen to sign with. The ONLY time I've ever not tipped someone in my life.
I guess I know the reason they take your card before you order anything. Safe to say a walk out or two, or three, or four , or five, or a MILLION have happened before in the past.</text>< pics>

The bartender was efficient and friendly. I Never Had An Empty Glass. I had the Baja bowl and it was very good. I had their hot salsa. It was not as hot as I prefer but it was tasty.< /Review>< response>

We were told on 3 occasions to stop singing and chanting by the host even though the other customers was enjoying out vibe and positive energy. On the 4th occasion this host told us we had to leave even though there was other white customers yalling enjoying the game. In all my years and restaurant going I have never experienced this! When we spoke to the manager he was clueless and did not even true to resolve the problem.

It's a cool place. I would say it's geared more towards college students or someone in their 20's. It's become a bit unsettling with pigeons flying around your head and walking around upstairs. I use to love sitting upstairs near the fire pit with my friends. Not so much any more. The food use to be really good.< /Text>

<Text>The food is good and mega margaritas are the main attractions.  Its small so it can get busy fast but it is worth the wait.  You have to pay for parking on the main street if you can find it.<//Text>< Pictures>

Their margaritas are HUUUUGE. One plate and appetizer is enough for 2 people. If you're drinking a margarita there I suggest just sharing a plate. I always leave super full🤣. But the vibe in there is fun!<//review>

Probably the best Cabo location. If you can snag a table on the deck upstairs, you get a really nice view of the beach. The last time I went was Sunday of Labor Day weekend. It wasn't overcrowded, so it was enjoyable. Prior to that, I had always gone at varying times on Saturday. In my Saturday experience, it is always too crowded, and I'm left standing in the way until my friends and I can swoop in on a table. The margaritas aren't bad, but coming from a margarita connoisseur, they are nothing to write home about. They do have a variety of fun flavors, though. And if size is your thing, this is your place.</Text>

Decent cantina. Friendly wait staff. Expected decor. Steak burrito was nicely put together and well flavored but unevenly heated. Outside and rooftop seating options. Next stop, Venice Beach.</Review>

<review>PLEASE! Read your RECEIPT!!

This is coming from a customer who has been to this and MANY Cabo Cantina's and I believe they are trained to skim (not scam) the customers.

They literally take your order with a smile, then serve you whatever drink they want. OR They serve you what you order and add El DORADO to the bill. El Dorado is the premium drink that is $12.95 or $13.95 depending on how they decide to bill it (or their fancy keying or renaming it to another, cheaper drink). I ALWAYS order the TJ classic which is $7.95 and the most basic Jose Cuervo Margarita.

They will charge for the El Dorado (Patron tequila) margarita and say they made a mistake if you challenge it. Then, instead of changing that, they offer to remove a food item (for alcohol billing and for skimming purposes) instead of adjusting the real price of the drinks you ORDERED.  They will say the price difference (b/c its not listed on the menu) is only $1 or $2 but as you can see, its $5 or $6!

In the End, ALWAYS check your receipt.  Do NOT pay for drinks misattributed to your bill. And, do NOT let them take advantage of you, because as long as I have been going there, THEY WILL ALWAYS TRY!.

I have been going there for over 11 years, and Everytime, EVERY location, they try the same skim (scam) and everytime I catch them, call them out, and get my bill adjusted!

Do the SAME!< /review></record>

I was walking into the toulet and was confronted by waiter saying we did not tip he and tips were not included in the cheque. I said i know this and explained why. She then went and told every staff memeber and customer she could find that we were dirty and did not tip. Might i add after having to ask for the cheque she said if we did not write a tip they would automaticaly add 18%.we wrote $0.00</review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

They let my huge dogo in when it was really cold while we were waiting on a order to go. Even gave me a bowl for water. Love the upstairs balcony thing with the fire place and heaters! I'll come back even tho I feel that quality of the food dosnt match the prices. It's just a great place to hang for a min and grab a drink.<//Text>

<Review>If you are looking for a place to drink next to the beach with less than ridiculous pricing, than this is a decent option. Well, pretty good considering it's one of only a few options.

Their margaritas are insanely sweet, even the classic. Also, please note that pricing on drinks can be a bit deceptive, especially during happy hour.

Food on the other hand is surprisingly good. Flavorful and in pretty generous portions, this is definitely not a good place for a diet but great with a beer or two.

Service is pretty unresponsive, so it isn't a great place if you're in a rush. But if you're afternoon or evening is relaxed, it's not a bad place to spend some time.</Review>< Pics>

Employees are sometimes more drunk than customers here. Music was loud at one point, bar tender couldn't hear me, so I leaned a bit over the bar. Immediately an employee who you can tell was under the influence yelled at me and my party. To not lean over the bar and other things that only someone who's had a few drinks would say. All tables are wobbly, so your huge overfilled margarita (yeah it will spill a tad bit). One restroom, not kept up, dirty. But then again this placed isn't so clean to start with. Bouncers are dummys too.</text>

Decent place at the beach. They only had Modelos in a can :(   I probably would've had more fun if I went with different company. I got there a bit late so I was just down for drinks but my date was more interested in stuffing his belly with tons of food. Mixed crowd, not too difficult to park, overall, decent.<//text>

<Review>this is my 2nd time going and I enjoyed myself BUT, my group and i felt as if the wait for our endless tacos was kind of long but the waitresses made that up to us and kept it coming. I love this location and love the vibe. the music NEEDS to get updated quickly. we were ready to dance and only about 5-8 songs were cool... we were there for about 3 1/2 hours soo the music should at least get some updated songs in there. but will come back. food is amazing!<//Review>< pictures>

<Text>Extremely racist! We came in with a group of college educated, professional people after a HBCU event and the manager immediately got concerned. He walked over to us as we were walking in and said, "we don't want any loud noise in here." "What?", I thought in my head. What insinuated that we were going to be loud? Outside of you judging the color of our skin. After all we are at a bar not a quiet, fancy restaurant. It was filled with white people talking loud, singing and having a good time. Yet as soon as we walked in we were asked or told not to be loud. We hadn't even taken our seats yet. As the time went on we were met with extremely poor service. The waitress took 15-20 mins before she ever arrived to our table, got our orders incorrect and demanded that we pay first. It's our policy she exclaimed. Not true by they way. Our food never came out and the manager kept walking by watching everything we were doing. One my friends heard something funny and busted out laughing and slapped the table in a big chuckle. The manager approached us and said we can't make noise or slap the table and asked us to leave. We willing complied because we were done with the rude treatment and politely asked for our credit cards back and a refund on the food we never received because we were still waiting on it to arrive. The manager said to an employee "they just don't want to pay for their food." How is that so when we paid in advance for the food? The food was never delivered to us (purposely). Seeing as though when we asking for a refund all of a sudden our food was being carried over to the table that we were asked to leave from. Because we are all very well paid, college graduated professionals we decided to leave the mistreatment, without a refund or the food. The whole situation was a display of their mistreatment and hatred for Black people. They displayed their racism and we did not let them provoke us. Attempt failed! We are too blessed to engage in racist mess. However, I  strongly hope that something is done so that this won't happen again. They should be shut down! It's 2019 people. Racism will not prevail.</Text><Time>1563826621540< /Time>< pictures>

<Text>This restaurant blatantly discriminated against me!!! I was wearing a hat that night and the security guard who was checking IDs pointed to a No Hat sign and told me I have to take the hat off before entering and put it back in my car. (I couldn't put it in my bag because the guard said some people sneak and put it back on once they're inside.) I felt like this was a bit extreme but I went all the way to my car and put it away. Once I got back in line the same security guard was checking the ID of a man with a baseball cap on (exactly like mine!) and then he let the man in!!! So I was next in line and I expected the guard to give me some type of an explanation. He didn't. So I asked, "I thought we weren't able to wear baseball caps?" and the guard says "Oh...umm, yeah....So the manager has this thing where he lets certain people that he knows in with hats on..." I didn't stay to hear the rest of his obvious lie. I walked in and told my friends what happened and we all left and went to the Cabo Cantina in Santa Monica, and I must add that I was able to freely wear my baseball cap along with the 20 other people who felt like wearing a hat that night!

*Do not go to the Cabo Cantina in Marina Del Rey! Go to the one in Santa Monica, we had a great time :)< /Text>< user_name>

<Text>This is definitely a fun atmosphere by the beach hanging out with friends for Mega margaritas, beers, nachos and a variety of food that may not be on your diet.  Of course they have Taco Tuesday all you can eat tacos for $6 something and happy hour 2 for 1 from 4pm-8pm.  Great spot to watch sports.  There is a parking lot at the end of the street, but it obviously fills up quickly as do most beach parking lots, street parking is there but tough to find.< /Text><pics>None</pics>< response>

Get in, get messy and get it on. This is a great place for sloshing back cheap beers and tacos and eye balling the scantily-clad showgirls or muscled-up machos that have been strutting up and down the Venice Beach boardwalk all day. Cheap and cheerful is theme of the food, drink and stand-out patrons, and its a great place to start or end your night.<//text>

This place is awesome. The fish tacos were amazing, the bartender was fun and local and made great conversation To get a sense of Local resident flavor, I highly recommend sitting at the bar and chatting it up with the staff While you munch. if I lived anywhere near there I would go back every week. I'm already Jonsing for their street tacos.< /review>

I Would have rated lower if possible, sure this place is grate if you're know or perceived as a spender but otherwise don't bother, the service here will leave a taste in your mouth worst than the shocking, cheap tasting, pre-made cocktails. Biggest regret is being lured in by the b1g1f offer as they will do everything they can to forget there own offer and attempt to rip you off. If you're bold enough to question this even within there own printed terms you will be in for a show especially if you have the young lady who served me, after this display we paid and left swiftly to be chased on to the street where we were the educated in the American tip system and told that if we expect better service next time we should really consider tipping, well young lady this is where I wish to re-educate you.

Good service = tip

Not the other way round.

Up side this was the only bad experience I had saying near by, I recommend the Venus waler down the road,,, much nicer and they will deserve the tip</text>

That’s me just being generous. The overall establishment was filthy. Dust completely covered EVERYTHING. The signs, the televisions, the decorations that hung from the ceiling, completely covered with thick dust. I stayed despite the constant thoughts that a dust bunny may of fallen on me. Our waiter “Mico” had given us attitude right from the start. It was obvious her day had been messed up prior and we just got all of the aftermath. While taking our order she was not attentive at all. Since I was a first timer I had questions and she seemed very irritated when answering. Since it was happy hour the drinks were 2 for 1 (margaritas) and you could make it a double. Well after completely explaining to me what a double was when our drinks came to the table they were not made in a double but in two singles. And they were all made tasting more like flavored lemonades then actual margaritas. When we brought it to her attention she advised us that she put in the order one way BUT the bartender just did their own thing, then she said in a smart way, I can just pour the two drinks in one cup if you want. That’s defeats the purpose of it being a double Mico. It was supposed to be three doubles; 1 Peach, & 2 Strawberry Mangos total of 3 drinks. Instead we got 6 diluted drinks. We wanted 2 shots in on drink more potent, but no. Anyways when we ordered food, I asked for a steak and chicken nachos, jalapeños and sour cream on the side. My friend ordered a chicken quesadilla. When my order arrived not only was it covered in sour cream, but there was also a sour cream on the side as a side? As for my friend her quesadilla came, halfway cooked & without chicken. That’s when I wanted to speak to a manager. The manager was definitely a character himself, I wish I would have gotten his name. He went checked to see what we ordered and compared it to what we received, too many errors at one table. He said it was miscommunication, & that the staff may not of been giving our waiter enough support.. how is that our issue? He was sarcastic but it was obvious he didn’t want to be bothered with us either. He said and I quote “it’s not us (as in me and my friends) it’s just everybody wants a lime or something & I’m fat, out of shape & I don’t like stairs (because we were upstairs) & I don’t like any of these mother f**k***” like WOW. You’re the owner of an establishment, do you talk to everyone like this? If you talk about your staff like this.. I wonder what you say about paying customers!! We were all pretty appalled. He did eventually get things some What situated. After our in counter our waitress went great lengths to avoid us, we again had to find a manger just to get our bill so we could pay and leave. What a nightmare. My coworkers love this spot they even agreed this was their first time at this location and it was horrible. I don’t care if there are other locations, my time and hard earned cash won’t be spent there ever again.</review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

<text>I would not have given them 1 star if it would have given​ the option to leave a review. The service and food sucks here. The staff is completely incompetent and rude at best. The manager lied to us saying that after a two hr wait and no food so the all you can eat tacos were no longer available. He would adjust a few items like drinks. Do Not Go Here!!!</text>< gmapID>

<review>This establishment is extremely unprofessional. I recently visited Cabo cantina and had a horrific experience! I was convinced by the server to order the large margarita. I ordered the margarita which was very thick and syrupy very unenjoyable. I asked the server if I could send it back and order something else and she told me she would have to get her manager. The manager Cody came out and with a very disrespectful tone and aggressive demeanor told me I will have to drink the margarita because  "it didn't appeared to be defective". I told him i simply didn't want it it was not enjoyable. He said it doesn't matter I have to pay for it. I should have known this place was shady when I looked at the menu and there were no prices. I had also ordered tacos which at that point i didn't want because I was so displeased with the service I was being given. His aggressive and forceful approach made me and my co worker want to leave. So I told him immediately to cancel my tacos before they came out. He said no I won't cancel anything you will be paying for those as well. All the while he was clearly on drugs sniffing and super amped and aggressive. I am a server at a nearby restaurant and was there for a co workers birthday and ended up leaving in tears. I have never in my life seen this type of behavior in any restaurant. I was forced to pay 35$ after not having had a single bite and only one sip of their disgusting margarita. He should be fired for his behavior or forced to lay off the drugs when working. Please do yourself a favor this place is all around horrible do go there.< /review><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmapID>

A sexist/feminist security guard by the name of Javier did not allow me to enter cabo cantina because I had a brown bandana around my head. Meanwhile a female walked out and back in with a black bandana around her head. I asked him whats up with that and he replied "she's a girl". So I told him "thats like me saying you're not a man cause u have a long ponytail on ya head bro". His manager was going to let me in but said my comment was argumentive. But by that time i didn't want any of their business anyways. I was just there to watch Moval Legend Kawhi get that ring for Toronto do you dig!!!</Text>

Cabo cantina is great if you’re really hungry and want to share a big plate of nachos or nacho fries. Their margaritas are really big but a little pricey. They usually have good music and music videos plus the game to watch! I go here with my friends a lot and sometimes even make new friends here 🙂</Review>

<name>Amorette Braun< /name><text>Went to this place on Monday. The wait staff was very friendly, the food was great. However, the drink prices were very high... Which we could have gotten over if it was disclosed in advance. $18.50 for a margarita was a bit unexpected and a slap in the face. Happy hour specials advertised all over the bar, buy one get one free happy hour on menu, it was happy hour time on a monday... full price, or double price was charged as the happy did not apply that day at owners discretion... SHOULD HAVE BEEN DISCLOSED IN ADVANCE OR at least verbally mentioned upon order.< /text><gmapID>0x80c2ba8e401b2d1d:0x924fbf79ef48be8c<//gmapID><date>1499284713209< /date>< rating>

<Text>This is the only place in The Square I won't go. It has it's crowd and that's fine,  but it's not for me. It smells like puke in the stairwell and the Delta Bravo content is high. The 2fer is nice at happy hour but I wouldn't go near the food.<//Text><userid>116292122875166773851</userid><rate>3<//rate>< Name>

<Review>Great happy hour just very small and tight bar. Not recommended for large groups. Much better for 1-4 adults. No parking lot. You have to park at the beach or fight for metered street parking. Has a rooftop patio which is nice if you don't get seated directly in the sun. Lots of tvs for watching sports. Food is ok moderately priced</Review><Date>1500254462663<//Date><Pics>None</Pics><user>113713454636305641513</user><resp>None</resp><rating>3< /rating><GmapID>0x80c2ba8e401b2d1d:0x924fbf79ef48be8c< /GmapID><name>Nikki Buckner< /name></record>

If I could give no stars I would. I have never had service this horrible. I opened a tab with the bartender, Paige, during happy hour but apparently when i went to close my tab, my card had magically disappeared, and Paige had ended her shift. A server told me to go down stairs and check if they had my card, even though I NEVER went down stairs but I  checked anyways.

Of course they did not have my card, then the manager came to talk to me to inform me that my tab was closed and was signed for, which was a shock for me. I asked to see the signed bill and the signature was obviously a different name and all the manager said was "I can't do anything, call your card company and cancel your card". The manager never took responsibility for the mistake nor apologized. Now I have to dispute the charges and get a new a card while the manager there has no care.< /Review>

<Review>Place was absolutely disgusting, they take forever to order your food, margaritas aren’t even considered happy hour cause they are extremely expensive, 2 girls walk out the restroom and when I enter restroom there’s vomit all over the place, bartenders drunk behind the bar, waiter extremely rude literally telling us that the drinks were going to be like water and she replies with “I told you “ , this place isn’t family oriented don’t bring your kids, place is a disgrace don’t go here!<//Review><Response>None</Response>< pics>

Poor customer service. Rude waitress. Can't think of her name but she has long black hair. & she's rude as hell. I will NEVER go back there. & they tried to say a guy i was with was racist because he stated "i don't want that white shot" indicating he wanted a dark shot instead of a clear one. I guess that's considered racism? Manager and staff were unprofessional!!! Don't go here!</Review>

<review>This is the worst restaurant experience that I have ever had. The food took forever, and was served cold,so I asked to speak to the manager. He answered my complaint using a deflective strategy, stating "Everyone else seems to be OK." I retorted that his comment was irrelevant to the poor service I received, along with the tough meat and cold food.This manager was rude,condescending, and indifferent, and responded with a terrible tone and demeanor.The waitress was not trained properly,and didn't even bother to take my food order,but instead just kept walking by even though I had initially asked for a menu.Even when she brought my beverage, she just walked away. I called to her,and she didn't even bother to respond. Terrible experience, rude manager who rather than addressing the issues at hand, chose to be a rude JERK!!!<//review>< Pics>

<Text>Ok I've gotten nachos at a lot of places. But these guys, BY FAR, give you the most nachos for the price I've EVER SEEN. I split one order with my friend all the time and I feel sick AF after almost always because we eat to much. Litterilly you need 3-4 people per order. It's great.

<Text>Came here with a group of colleagues on a Wednesday night. The place was empty and the bartender was mediocre: enormous margaritas with mostly sweet syrup and little booze. Also we arrived about ten minutes before the "2-for-1" offer began but the bartender didn't budge on giving us the offer before time despite us bringing the place to life from a standstill start. I'm unlikely to return.</Text>< pictures>

Poor customer service. Rude waitress. Can't think of her name but she has long black hair. & she's rude as hell. I will NEVER go back there. & they tried to say a guy i was with was racist because he stated "i don't want that white shot" indicating he wanted a dark shot instead of a clear one. I guess that's considered racism? Manager and staff were unprofessional!!! Don't go here!<//Review>

They don't honor the unlimited mimosas / bloody marys on "holiday weekends" even though the place was pretty empty. They also cut the unlimited hours on football sundays down, but don't post it.

The food was decent before they re-worked the menu. Now it's not worth the money.

And as a final kicker, my credit card info was stolen last time I left it for them to hold for the tab.

In search for a new brunch / football hangout place. Not going back.< /text>

< review>
Didn’t have a good experience. Went to celebrate my brothers birthday and had a very agitated waitress by the name of Jadeon. She lacked patience and constantly got some of our orders wrong. Once we let her know the orders were a bit malfunctioned she had a very nasty attitude towards my sister. I already noticed she was agitated which is why i proceeded to say that you everytime she came to our table. She yelled at my sister and my sister yelled back, refused to serve us, and didn’t advise another waitress to assist us. Maybe Jadeon needs another job or needs to practice better customer service skills. Also the chicken tacos i ordered were very dry. I as well as my family did not appreciate her behavior not one bit. In continuance, there was no manager we could talk to regarding Jadeon’s behavior. We asked to see a manager and didn’t get another server nor manager. Jadeon needs an attitude check, luckily we were being patient with her because it could’ve went very bad for her.< /review>

<rate>1<//rate><Review>Terrible!  I have never experienced such rude, ridiculous and unprofessional behavior.  The manager/bartender Ray demanded the removal of the guy I was with because of a dispute over the quality of the drink he was given.  Really? If you're that sensitive about your drink making ability perhaps you should either improve your skills or just do something else.  As if that weren't enough of an insult he tried to add an intimidation factor (although no one was afraid of him) by standing over the guy as he was seated and being increasingly disrespectful until he (Ray) was asked to walk away.  Thankfully my friend was level headed and there was ONE staff member qualified to handle conflict as to not allow the situation to escalate.  There obviously needs to be more training for employees here.  I'm reluctant to add the race factor to the scenario, but if anyone else has had a similar experience please let someone know these things are going on here I can't see how it is being tolerated by ownership.  Very upsetting<//Review>< pics>

Food was horrible. The beans were canned the rice tasted like it came out of a bag. The fish tacos were decent. All in all I had a bad experience.<//text>

<username>sheena franks</username><Text>Worst customer experience ever! They brought everyones order out that i was with except for mine, waited 10 mins & no food so asked where it was they came back & said the order never got put in. By the time i got my food everyone else was done. Then took forever just to figure out how to ring us up. And still charged me for the wrong order. I will never ever go back to this place. The waitresses clearly have no clue what there doing!!!!!<//Text>< time>

<text>For several years now I've been coming to this Cabo Cantina every so often. Mostly to watch sports and have some of their giant margaritas. I finally went to their Taco Tuesday and I was very impressed!

I've never liked their food much (I'm Mexican, I know what authentic Mexican food should taste like), but the margaritas are great along with other drinks. The decor and atmosphere is very fun and young. They have an upstairs and downstairs area, both with outside patios. Located right off the Venice Beach Boardwalk, it is the perfect location for "drinks on the beach" (you can't literally drink on the beach, unfortunately, but you catch my flow).

Taco Tuesday was great! I was worried about trying the tacos but once they were on the table I was excited to try them! Not disapointed at all; they were really delicious, at least the steak and chicken ones I had were. They had plenty of meat and came with a side of mexican rice and black beans. Paired up with a giant margarita, Taco Tuesday was perfect here! It was a full house for the Happy Hour which goes from 4pm-10pm, everyone enjoying a conversation over sports, food, and drinks.

Since it gets really busy, service isn't as quick but thats understandable. All the servers are very nice. I've never had a issue with customer service here. Parking sucks, but if you are lucky you might just get a meter right outside or there is also valet across the street and a parking lot at the end of the street.<//text><pics>None</pics><resp>None<//resp><Gmap_id>0x80c2ba8e401b2d1d:0x924fbf79ef48be8c< /Gmap_id></record>

You really can't miss Cabo Cantina when walking on the street here because of the crowd and the general rukus (popular here). I found Cabo to be true to my other Cabo experience in Pacific Beach (party town numero uno). If you like this type of energy then this will be your vehicle of happiness.

Surprisingly the overall ratings are only 3.5. My question is how can a place be this popular, crowded most of the time and get this low of a rating. Perhaps those that enjoy the vibe are not the type to do a review (ever think of that). Sometimes the most demonstrative visitor is someone that may have had an off experience. They almost always give the lowest 1 Star rating; when in general they should expect to have some attitude because of the mix of alcohol and average tolerance to the spirits.

Plz read before thinking of going !!!!!!!!!!Family and I came to this place after a nice walk down Venice beach. First thing first we were not greeded at all walked up stairs to the balcony on to be greeted by a hole lot of flys just flying around went back down stairs and that's when it started. I can write a story on this place but please believe me when I say waitress are very rude!!...food was very poor not good cold soggy with no flavor!.we returned or food of course and the manager/ owner came out with very poor customer service and was very rude. So if your looking for a place to eat with the family plz stay away from this place for you will get robbed for your money and looked down upon if your not a local.... Not family orientated and kid friendly by far.</Review>

I barely write reviews because I dnt wanna take the time to talk about a place unless it really deserves it. I have never been to a place that treats you with such disrespect. This cabo cantina needs to take some pointers from the other locations like the one in West Hollywood.  I get it it's like the "Mexican style" bar and grill so you don't expect much. But you should at least be treated like a customer. First the blended Mega Margarita that I split with my friends was really icy. It taste like a slurpee from 7 11 that was really watered down. Way to much ice. I coulnt even taste the flavor I got let alone the alcohol. But I drank it anyway. Didn't bother to tell the server. We also got nachos which was great. Then I ordered buy one get one Margarita on ice which was really good. The problem didn't really come until we got the bill. The server (I dnt know her name but seems to be a dark hair white girl)  wrote 20% of 100 =$20 on the ticket. I'm a server my friends are servers so we felt really disrespected at the fact that she wrote it on the bill. Like we were going to do it anyway because we are of the industry but she didn't have to write it on the bill. We felt because we are a diverse group of minorities she had a need to write it on the bill. Some restaurants have the percentages PRINTED at the bottom for your convenience, but she flat out wrote it with her pen. When we asked her about it she brushed it off and said it was a bad habit. So then we start to wonder if this is policy so we called a manager( a seemingly white male named Guy )over. Before he came I saw her debrief him of what happen (which was really nothing). When he came he seem to already know what he was gonna say. When we asked him if it's policy he said yes because we have a lot of tourists come here. Then I said tourist are not you shouldn't try to force tip out of pple. Then he said its policy and its not going to change. And then said every cabo cantina is different.  I thought to myself yes every one is different, they aren't racist. The manager NAMED GUY was very rude. When I asked him for his name he said it was Guy and then he asked for mine and I said no. Which seem to really piss him off. It then Looked like he gestured to security to kick us out. They didn't get a chance to we were leaving anyway. My thing is you never know who you are going to get we were going to tip 20% anyway. Because of the manager we tipped her NOTHING. She wasnt a good server anyway. The team is only as good as the leader and the leader sucks. Not coming here again. I'll stick to what I know.< /text>

<text>I barely write reviews because I dnt wanna take the time to talk about a place unless it really deserves it. I have never been to a place that treats you with such disrespect. This cabo cantina needs to take some pointers from the other locations like the one in West Hollywood.  I get it it's like the "Mexican style" bar and grill so you don't expect much. But you should at least be treated like a customer. First the blended Mega Margarita that I split with my friends was really icy. It taste like a slurpee from 7 11 that was really watered down. Way to much ice. I coulnt even taste the flavor I got let alone the alcohol. But I drank it anyway. Didn't bother to tell the server. We also got nachos which was great. Then I ordered buy one get one Margarita on ice which was really good. The problem didn't really come until we got the bill. The server (I dnt know her name but seems to be a dark hair white girl)  wrote 20% of 100 =$20 on the ticket. I'm a server my friends are servers so we felt really disrespected at the fact that she wrote it on the bill. Like we were going to do it anyway because we are of the industry but she didn't have to write it on the bill. We felt because we are a diverse group of minorities she had a need to write it on the bill. Some restaurants have the percentages PRINTED at the bottom for your convenience, but she flat out wrote it with her pen. When we asked her about it she brushed it off and said it was a bad habit. So then we start to wonder if this is policy so we called a manager( a seemingly white male named Guy )over. Before he came I saw her debrief him of what happen (which was really nothing). When he came he seem to already know what he was gonna say. When we asked him if it's policy he said yes because we have a lot of tourists come here. Then I said tourist are not you shouldn't try to force tip out of pple. Then he said its policy and its not going to change. And then said every cabo cantina is different.  I thought to myself yes every one is different, they aren't racist. The manager NAMED GUY was very rude. When I asked him for his name he said it was Guy and then he asked for mine and I said no. Which seem to really piss him off. It then Looked like he gestured to security to kick us out. They didn't get a chance to we were leaving anyway. My thing is you never know who you are going to get we were going to tip 20% anyway. Because of the manager we tipped her NOTHING. She wasnt a good server anyway. The team is only as good as the leader and the leader sucks. Not coming here again. I'll stick to what I know.<//text>< pics>

I went last night. HORRIBLE experience. Never will I return to this cabo again. The waitress told me and my family that if we don't tip her she will stop serving us. That is what u call bad customer service. And the manager agreed with her. My husband told her don't charge the card I'll give cash and she looked at him ignored him and charged it to the card anyway. I believe her name was ellie rude worker.<//Review>

Two floors, always packed at nights, average service.  Cheap low quality food and average beer.  Noisy inside, hard to find parking outside, unwelcoming atmosphere.  Tiny bathroom that always has a long line.< /text>

Everything is terrible. The normal sized (2-1) margaritas tasted like juice and the large ones weren't much better for $17.50. Take a pass on the Cantina.< /Review>

One site said they open at 9:30, their website said  10:30, then the guy at the door said they decided to open at 11. Is it possible to give a place 0 stars?< /Text>

Came tonight on a Tuesday with a few friends and seriously the security wouldn't let me in because I had on sweats. Wasn't even baggy or anything just nice and fit sweats and on all days i couldn't come in because ONLY on Tuesdays they won't allow it! Smh won't come ever even if it ain't the weekday!< /text>

Good environment. Drinks are decent, very sweet for the most part lots of juice not much liquor. Food is good, nothing out of the ordinary. Good Mexican food that will leave you full. Nachos and margaritas are my go to!
Beware of them double charging your card and staff for the most part isn’t friendly.< /Text>

<Review>(Translated by Google) to access the room, the security asks for an ID to see if you are of legal age.
You can sit where there is a seat, to order you have to give a credit card or money as a "deposit". Music a little too loud as there is already a lot of people buzzing.
Average cocktails in both quality and price.

(Original)
per accedere al locale la security chiede ID per vedere se si è maggiorenni.
Ci si può sedere dove si trova posto, per ordinare bisogna dare la carta di credito o dei soldi come "cauzione". Musica un po troppo alta dato che già c'è molto brusio della gente.
Cocktail nella media sia come qualità che come prezzo.< /Review>< Pics>

(Translated by Google) Practically by the sea, amazing food, spectacular Margaritas and ... good company! ;-)
It is also a safe place, where bands and team caps are prohibited, so as to avoid fights.
Absolutely recommended!

Praticamente in riva al mare, cibo strepitoso, Margarita spettacolari e... buona compagnia! ;-)
Inoltre è anche un posto sicuro, dove vietano bande e cappellini di squadre, così da evitare risse.
Assolutamente consigliato!< /text>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) My partner and I went to eat and just sat at the table, the cards were stuck from the dirt that was on it. We decided to eat there as the price seemed reasonable, except for the drinks that were not on the menu. When he brings us the bill, we see that 2 beers cost us $ 14.50. And also the waitress, despite not being attentive and a bit pushy, tells us that we should leave a tip (18% of the amount of the ticket). We asked him if it was compulsory and he told us that if with all the nose, now we know that it is not. Terrible service (except for the guy) and price. DO NOT GO

(Original)
Fuimos a comer mi pareja y yo y sólo sentarnos en la mesa, las cartas estaban pegadas de la suciedad que había en la misma. Decidimos comer allí ya que el precio parecía razonable, menos el de las bebidas que no aparecía en la carta. Cuando nos trae la cuenta, vemos que 2 cervezas nos costaron 14,50$. Y además la camarera a pesar de no ser atenta y un poco prepotente, nos dice que debemos de dejarle propina (18% del importe del ticket). Le preguntamos si era obligatorio y nos dijo que si con todo el morro, ahora sabemos que no lo es. Pésimo servicio (excepto por el chico)  y precio. NO VAYAS< /Review>

<review>(Translated by Google) Although attractive, the happy hour only concerns the margueritas which are frankly medium and too salty. Noisy and soulless place.

(Original)
Bien qu'attirant, le happy hour ne concerne que les margueritas qui sont franchement moyennes et trop salées. Lieu bruyant et sans âme.< /review><userid>114521614752360684349< /userid>< rate>
