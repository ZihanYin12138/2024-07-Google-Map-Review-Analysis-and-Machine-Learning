Barsha Wines & Spirits , the staff there was extremely nice to us while we shot there, pointing us to good locations and letting us know where and when we can take our photos.

Great little place for wine and small plates/charcuterie. One of the servers (maybe manager or owner) was really friendly and informative, the others did what they had to or were asked to do. Small parking lot in front and a good amount of street parking nearby. Worth a visit, but if you're starving, make sure to fill up a bit before visiting.< /Review>

<review>I love their dance hall around the corner and have been there numerous times to get my groove on with a pomegranate martini in hand.  When I finally came here to eat, I wanted to find the owner, bring him a pen and paper and ask him for his autograph.

Was very disappointed given the rave reviews.  Was calling from out of state with a request if they could deliver a case of wine as a Christmas gift to relative who lives around the corner from them (literally).  Could not be bothered to look up if they carried the wine I was looking for, and could not tell me if they could deliver the case or not although they said they have... Guess they are not into sharing the news.</review>

<Text>This is a nice higher end place.  The owner is very involved with everything and has great taste in all choices.  They have a great selection of wine and beer along with cheese and meat selections.  Great combos put together.  Highly recommend as a first date place for a quick meeting that could easily expand to much longer.</Text><Rating>5< /Rating><Response>None<//Response><user_name>Charlie Brown< /user_name><Date>1526774264137</Date>< Pictures>

<review>I absolutely adore Barsha. I only discovered it recently and have been back multiple times. The atmosphere is intimate and cozy for a small group wine tasting. They offer excellent dips, cheeses, and small bites to accompany the wine. You can order a wine flight or by the glass depending on the occasion. If you're just looking to pick up a great cheese and wine for a party, the staff is great at making recommendations. We had a friend's small birthday get together here the other week and it was a blast! Highly recommend it.

Edit: pro tip! They will give you an all red or all white flight if you ask for it!< /review>< Date>

Went last night with a friend after yoga class.  The waiter gave us two seating options.  One spot was sitting side by side facing an art wall, so we chose option 2, on a high table where we could sit on the corner and face each other.  Another waiter came over and moved us saying a party had reserved it.  So we moved to the less desirable seat.  We were there for an hour and no one ended up sitting at the table we originally wanted.  The same waiter took our order and we only got part of our order.  I don't know if he thought we were under dressed (yoga attire) or if it was that there was only 2 of us but he was only concerned about the bigger parties in the room.  The owner came at the end and offered us the bruschetta on the house but we were done with our wine and ready to leave. Surprisingly, we got our check with nothing comped.  Disappointing experience.  Won't be going back.</Text>

<Review>My first thought on the first visit was "this place would KILL in the Manhattan Beach village" but now I love and appreciate it even more exactly because it's *NOT* in the village!

After driving past wondering about Barsha for so long I've been in several times now and realized quickly all the 5 star reviews are real. There's nothing not to love: the retail side is a surprisingly interesting and well-curated wine selection, with a lot of European, old-world, and esoteric stuff that you will absolutely NOT find anywhere else in the South Bay. Also some craft beers, outstanding whiskey and spirits section, quirky gifts, Riedel stemware, and killer cheeses and charcuterie to take home--which brings us the the "other" side of the room: the tasting and munchies bar.

The 4-selection wine flights, half glasses, and full glasses available are ALL great and change monthly.  The owner and chief pourer Adnen has fantastic taste and knowledge and chooses these carefully, and so far I've loved every single selection. But the munchies..... wow, not your everyday cheapo cheese and crackers. They surprised the hell out of me with the super high quality of cheeses, charcuterie, pâtés, homemade dips, and broiled warm baguette pieces drizzled liberally with Tunisian olive oil that makes me hungry just thinking about it.

But most importantly everyone is nice! The staff is super friendly which must be a reflection of Adnen and his wife Lenora. Adnen is probably going to be the warmest and most engaging owner you'll ever meet in ANY business. It's a great and laid back vibe and it just always feels good in there. Pop in soon and I'm sure you'll agree. 5 stars well earned!<//Review>< username>

<review>This is my favorite wine bar in the South Bay, hands down! The owner is fantastic at accommodating individual tastes and giving noteworthy recommendations. The Granny Smith-burratta bruschetta is out of this world!! Thank you for always being our first stop on our rare date nights!

I just celebrated my 34th bday here. I love this place. It's a little more spacious than your average wine more with more seating and tables; that doesn't necessarily mean you'll get a seat. This is is always packed. I love the plate of dips the tapenade is my favorite.</Text>

Calvin was really really good and did a clean, accurate, and gentle job cutting my hair. Calvin was at a fast pace but not rushed.  I come all the way from Washington and I can say that this place is special. I recently just got curly hair and other barbers haven’t been able to do what I had in mind, but that was before I got a cut from Calvin. Calvin and the other employee were very friendly and chill. I honestly can’t think of something that I didn’t like. I give this barbershop and Calvin a 5/5 star….<//review>

Rose is Great. Uses blades for actual barber level cuts. Small place. Quicker than normal cuts for barber shop but they tend to be busy so it's all good because cuts are clean and solid</Text>

<text>I didn't have my glasses so I instructed them to deal with me, and they exploited that reality and sent me out resembling a disproportionate prickly plant. Required a discount or to have them fix it and it was simply malevolent remarks after another.

I'm recently disturbed that they want to do things like this and pull off it. Not on the grounds that it transpired. $20 cash based fails to measure up to their vindictive reaction.</text>< pictures>

I'm just upset that they think they can do things like this and get away with it. Not because it happened to me. $20 out of pocket pales in comparison to their malicious response.<//text>< Date>

My son normally goes to see Nick. The staff are very detailed and know what they’re doing. My son happens to have a dip in his skull from a soft spot that never quite rounded. Most barbers out there could never get my sons haircut right, where the dip was not noticeable. Nick seems to always get it right! He makes sure to leave my sons hair just a little longer in the center, so the skull dip is not noticeable at all!

I love the styles and detail that Mt Pleasant Barbers perform on all their patrons! They’ve have great skill!

I highly recommend this place and to make sure you call when they open, to book your spot! That’s just how good they are!<//review>

My son had an appointment at 11:30 and we arrived at 11:27. This being our 1st time there I didn’t know it was cash only. I told them I’d be right back to pull out cash around the corner. I come back with in a few minutes and the man in the back proceeds to tell me next time don’t come if I’m late. So very rude and unprofessional! We walked out and went somewhere else that will appreciate our business!< /Review>

Love this place. Have been coming here for 3 years now and they never disappoint. Always understand what i want and they make it just how I describe it. Highly recommend. I would suggest calling to make an appointment though because they get packed and if you do a walk in it does take long. Other than that it’s a great place.< /review>

Best fades on the east side hands down. Hardest part is getting an appt. You have to call the day of starting at 9am. My girl Janice will take care of you but be sure to call early cuz her time slots go fast. But all the other barbers are prime. Rose, the shop owner does really good cuts also. $17 for your basic fade< /Review>

<text>Best place in San Jose to get your hair cut!! All the barbers here will give you a killer hair cut!!! It's best to call in the morning and schedule an appointment better than walking in and having to wait!! I've been going to get hair cuts from Stella for the past 2 years and I've never been disappointed!<//text></record></dataset><record>

Calvin is THE BEST around! There is no question about it! Great people working here and it is a true family owned and operated business. They remember their customers and actually care about you. I've been going here since 2008 and have been impressed with the quality of my haircut every single time.< /text>

I've been to haircut places a lot and I never get the haircut I want. I always ask my barber the haircut that I want but, they don't do a good job on cutting my haircut. So, I recommend you guys to go to this barber shop because they do a excellent job on cutting your hair.After they were done, I looked like a million bucks.<//text>

I called this establishment and asked about haircuts and if they provide straight razor cuts. They advised me yes. I just showed up and he told me to leave after he said they had no time despite closing at 6:30pm. They stated that I need an appointment even though I was never advised this over the phone after I concluded our conversation with "Thanks, I'll see you soon." It's unfortunate for them being as though I give a 25 dollar tip every time I get a cut. The asian gentleman was very disrespectful and not about his business. Despite this, I must say that the women were very polite and greeted me appropriately. I don't know what to think. This is the first shop that I have ever been treated negatively at.< /review>

The barber allows walk in from 9am to 11am. Anytime after noon, it would be by appointment so calling them is recommended.</Text>< Pics>

The service at her dental office from the receptionist to the hygienist, dental assistant and Dr Sabina herself provided nothing short of superb service. I highly recommend Dr Sabina and her staff to care for your dental needs.

I’m super thankful to Dr.Sabina and all staff of the dentistry.
We were in Sacramento area for vacation, my sister had an emergency with her tooth, the strong progressing pain on the beginning of the long weekend. Once Dr. Sabina heard that my sister is in pain, she agreed to see her on the same day even though my sister was not her patient and most of the dentistry’s were closing early that day.
She and her assistants were super attentive, they quickly did the X-ray, examine the tooth, found the issue with the root canal, explained all the possible ways to treat it to my sister, did the initial treatment to relief the pain for that long weekend and even referred her to the root canal specialist. Dr Sabina also followed up with her after the long weekend to check on her tooth pain and progress via phone.
The staff was super friendly, and even share with me the cake they had to calm me down and celebrate 4th of July.<//text>

<Review>I just moved to Sac this past October, and unfortunately had to find a dentist unexpectedly in a hurry! I unfortunately called another place first, got a very bad first opinion, and then called Dentistry of East Sac next, not only getting me in quickly but saving my tooth as well! Excellent work, and you feel comfortable as soon as you enter. Thank you again and until next time.<//Review>< gmapID>

Every single person in this office is absolutely wonderful. They send friendly reminders to keep my appointments on track, and have been super helpful anytime I’ve had questions. Dr. Sabina is so kind and gentle, and explains everything in detail as she goes. You can immediately sense her dedication and compassion. While I haven’t met everyone there, Carla, Patty, and Tondra are so fantastic. I feel like part of the family when I’m there.< /Text>

<Review>Dentistry of East Sacramento has a charming small office feel where everyone knows your name. I was able to get an appointment quickly and the service was not rushed. Everything in the office seemed peaceful from the music, the tv entertainment, and everyone spoke clearly and was attentive to my needs. Christine, Marie, Karla and Dr Sabrina have excellent bedside manners which made the nightmare experiences of past dentist office visits seemed so long ago. I highly recommend this great team< /Review>< pics>

Like many I have a phobia of the dentist. The team at Dentistry of East Sac has such a warm, welcoming way about them that I was surprisingly relaxed. The care team is gentle, explains everything well, and just has a way with people that puts even the scardiest of cats at ease.<//review>

<Text>Dr Sabine is the best Dentist I have ever had.  I came to her after a disasterous episode with another Sacramento dentist, where my tooth broke off.  Sr Sabine explained how my jaw would adjust and it did.  She is courteous, friendly, trustworthy, gentle, excellent at her craft.  You won’t feel pain.  Getting a crown from Dr Sabine is as close to a joy as you can get.  I whole heartedly recommend Dr Sabine.  Our family loves her!</Text>< rate>

I would like to commend the staff and Dr. Sabina for an outstanding experience. I’ve not been to the dentist in many years, and from the moment I walked in, I was made to feel welcome and comfortable. I could not be more pleased with the professionalism of the entire staff, especially Dr. Sabina. I would reassure anyone that Dr. Sabina is a highly skilled dentist. I highly recommend Dentistry of East Sacramento. After my experience, my wife and child will also become patients here.</review>

It was my first time seeing a dentist since moving to the area, so I was establishing care with Dr. Sabina and I look forward to receiving my care from her. They were very accommodating of my challenging schedule and were so kind to see me at 7am. I would recommend Dentistry of East Sacramento to anyone after this first visit.< /Review>

2021-Once again great service! Dr. Sabina and her assistant Karla are absolutely fabulous! They do a great job of cleaning your teeth with care, compassion and thoroughness. From the moment you walk into their office you feel welcomed and you begin to get excellent service. Thank you for the wonderful service I received again. I highly recommend this dentist for people that are afraid to get cleanings. She will put you at ease  and do a very thorough but gentle job.😁

2020- Wonderful service! Friendly, great cleaning! Highly recommend 👍🏼</text>

All of the staff is extremely caring, especially Dr. Sabina who is the nicest dentist I’ve ever met in my life. She took the time to listen to my concerns and for the first time, I actually have a dentist who understands my situation. Extremely bright and compassionate!< /Review>

<Time>1584549025772</Time><rating>5< /rating><Text>This was my first visit to Dr. Sabina. My previous dentist retired and the Dr. that bought his practice said I needed two crowns. I went to see Dr. Sabina to get a second opinion as to the need for crowns. Dr. Sabina examined my teeth and  reviewed the X-rays. She was very thorough with her explanation of the condition of my teeth. She is a conservative practitioner and is taking a “wait and see” approach to determine the need for crowns. Her technician took pictures of the teeth in question so the Dr. has a baseline to compare in future exams. I was very pleased with Dr. Sabinas approach to my dental care and greatly appreciate her explanations. Dr. Sabina is my new dentist. I’m very happy to have found her.</Text>< pics>

Dentistry of East Sacramento is one of the best practices I’ve ever had service from. They will be my new dental service in Sacramento.
My appointment was promptly made the same day due to a very painful cavity that required a root canal. Typically I have very tooth nerve sensitivity. The work was performed flawlessly with zero pain and a high quality job.
I recommend this office.  Thank you again.< /Text>

i am so glad I found this office when I did. I have been coming here for the last 2 years and don’t plan on going anywhere else. Not only is Dr. Sabina and her Staff professional but they take time to listen to any concerns or reasons why you would be nervous about receiving dental care. I highly recommend giving this office a visit!<//review>

When I made an appointment the receptionist was really friendly and very helpful. On arrival of my appointment the check in process was fast and easy. Dr. Sabina was very knowledgeable and made me feel comfortable. Her work was amazing and she made sure if I felt any discomfort to let her know. I hardly felt anything, I had a very excellent appointment. Thank you staff and Dr. Sabina for everything.</review>

<text>I broke a tooth and I - first-time patient -  was given an appointment the morning after I called. Tondra was patient and informative regarding payment plans, and Dr. Sabina was a dream. Kind and capable, I appreciated her thorough exam and approach to treatment options, ultimately recommending the most cost-effective plan. Her assistants Cherie and Yasmine were terrific, too. Thrilled to have found a dentist as wonderful as the one I went to for over 20 years in Silicon Valley!<//text>< Pictures>

<Review>I had my 2nd appointment today. I have a fear of going to the dentist, so before my first appointment, it had been about 7 years since I last went to a dentist... Even so, once I picked this office to get over my fear I have been SO relieved! Dr. Sabina has a calming presence that has helped me feel motivated to stay on top of taking care of myself. I like this office so much, I switched my kids over to this office and have referred at least 2 other people!</Review>< Date>

I had an amazing first time experience at Dentistry of East Sac! They not only responded to my inquiry for an appointment quickly, but they were able to schedule me in the same day! They are also paperless if you want to support a green business! Everyone was so nice and friendly, and Dr. Sabina educated me through my x-rays and cleaning. I highly recommend this team if you are in the market for a new dentist!< /text>

<text>I recently moved to the Sacramento  area  and needed a new dentist. I saw Dr Sabine for the first time last week. She looked me over and made a plan to schedule work on my problem areas. She was informative and gentle while she was working. The cost seem the same as I've  paid in the past. The hygienist  cleaned my teeth quickly and I was out of there  in a reasonable amount of time. The office staff was friendly and helpful. I guess I have found my new dentist.<//text><name>Pamala Bratthauer<//name>< rate>

<Text>After struggling with finding a dentist I trusted and didn’t feel like was just trying to rush me in and out and sell me things without real explanations I had become very frustrated with dentists. I got a new job with new insurance (Delta Dental) and DR Sabina was a recommended dentist on their website. I instantly felt welcome, she explained everything she did and really took her time to understand my needs/ issues and talk them through. I had a great experience. Her Dental assistant was great too and the women at the front desk was very helpful and friendly.<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None</resp><gmapID>0x809ad09ae6f1d287:0x3f1e192236442aa6</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

This was my second experience at Dentistry of East Sacramento and I found it to be as pleasant and comprehensive as my first. As a seasoned individual whose had a fair amount of dental work over the years, I appreciate their thoughtfulness and pragmatic approach to my dental care. Being new to Sacramento I’m glad I found them...Highly recommended!< /Review>

It was a very pleasant experiance and very quick. Staff and Dr. Sabrina were really nice. They stated I didn’t need x-rays or probing this time which was great as it saved a lot of time and made for and easy visit. I appreciate not having extra things done unless absolutely necessary.< /Text>

Nothing but warm welcoming from the front desk (Barbara) to the back office (Dr. Sabrina and her team) Every one of these ladies were extremely courteous, friendly,  passionate and just overall helpful during my first and second visit. No words can express how I really feel but it's all good feelings. If you ever looking for a dentist where you can be honest about how nervous you are, or suffer from anxiety just come on in they will make sure by the time you leave there you will say to yourself, WOW! now that was perfection. I know, I was one of them but not any more. THANK YOU LADIES!< /text>

<Text>I haven't had a cleaning in years, too often switching of health insurance and just all-around awful experiences at DNT offices. Here? Complete difference. Dr. Sabina paid close attention to every detail of every tooth, took all considerations and concerns I had and ensured she would provide a solution within budget and if my insurance was able to cover. The idea of taking everything in-house is excellent when it comes to convenience. Not only was this the most thorough of cleanings I've ever had, but the staff were ALL amazing and welcoming. The level of customer service there is something most should take after. If you are in need, I recommend Dr. Sabina's office!!!!!</Text></record>

I needed a crown re glued in a Saturday afternoon. Dr. Abraham was kind enough to stay even though the office was technically closed. She was so nice and helpful. I was even a new patient. Took her time and was not in a rush. I couldn't have asked for more.< /Review>

<Review>Start to finish I was impressed. Found them on yelp, submitted a form for cleaning. Tondra emailed the very next morning, followed by a call and prompt appointment. Once in the office my good experience became great. Tondra, Karina and the dentist were all fantastic. I had a time crunch, and wedding the following day. They took very good care of me, corrected previous dentists bad advice and set me up for next appt. I for sure found the dentist for my entire family.< /Review>< pictures>

I had been in pain for a couple weeks every time I ate. The pain would go away, but as anyone who has had tooth pain knows, any is not a good sign. I knew I had a cavity and that if I didn’t get it filled, I would need a root canal.
I have no medical insurance, let alone dental insurance.
I called the office and the receptionist (Barbara?) was super nice and very kind. They made me an appointment for the next day.
The office offered me a deal because I was paying in cash. They also told me that as a new patient, if I got my teeth cleaned and they looked over my whole mouth, I would be saving money. (Rather than just getting that painful spot looked at.)
Turns out I had two cavities, I got the painful one filled that day, and they made an appointment for the next month to fix the other cavity. I didn’t want to be totally numb.
I didn’t eat before I came in, and they offered me a snack, so I wouldn’t be  uncomfortable while they were working on my teeth.
I was injured by a dentist when I was younger and I had put off going to the dentist for years, out of fear.
This place is amazing. My dentist, Dr. Fnu Sabina, was super kind and explained exactly what she was going to do, she numbed me before even giving me the numbing shot. I didn’t have any pain at any point during the procedure.
The assistant and the dentist were amazing. I’m not afraid to go to this office.
I can’t even begin to tell you (whoever may be reading this) how grateful and elated I am to have a dentist I trust and look forward to seeing again.
They’re accepting new patents I think!</review>

<Text>I found this office because they were one of the few offices that were open on Saturday for an emergency appointment. Dr. Sabina retunrned my call on a late Friday night with an early AM appointment the next day. I now go to the dentist office regularly and have brought my whole family. My children are 6 & 10 and she is amazing with them both. We usually go to appointments together and they are entertained while I’m being seen. There are 3 amazing women that work in this office!!! From billing, to chairside manor, to explaining what I need/ what’s required they have it down pact! Every part of your experience will be amazing. I have been referred to a great endodontist and orthodontist from this office as well. They deserve 10 stars ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️</Text>< gmap_id>

<Review>East Sacramento Dentistry Office has been my only go to place for dental work for over the past 4 years, they are convienetly open on saturdays which is very rare to find, and when I had a really bad toothache they were able to fit me in at a last mintue notice. I also had a few needed crowns put in, over the past year and they were not pushy at all,  and very honest.

Barbara the front desk receptionist is super smart, honest, and really helpful about dental stuff etc. I highly recommend people to this dentist office often because they are fun, cool people, reasonable, but primarilycause the work is always done good and you get honest feedback.

Give them a try, they are locally operated  and owned too.</Review>< date>

Staff here are just horribly rude. Two minutes after I and a group of friends walked a younger female employee rounded the same corner we just had, looking like she'd just run a marathon to catch up to us. She immediately accosted us, telling us to "not play" with the items we had casually picked up to look at, and asked us if we needed any help. We said we were fine - to which she replied with (I kid you not) "I'm sure you are", in the sassiest, most sarcastic tone I would think possible. She proceeded to follow our group around the store, making her presence overtly known by pretending to make sure all the display cabinets in our vicinity were locked by loudly banging on them. In general, she tried her best to make us as uncomfortable as possible to get us to leave. We were not loud, we were not rowdy, and we were not obnoxious. She obviously profiled us as young adults who weren't going to buy anything at the astronomical prices they charge, and was quick to pressure us out of the store - while completely ignoring a different group of women actually messing with the merchandise and being loud. The prices are sky-high, the antiques are completely mediocre, and the staff is RUDE BEYOND BELIEF! Frankly I'm not sure how they're still in business. If you want an actual selection of cool antiques at very decent prices, go to Granny's right next door. Whatever you do, don't step foot in here!</Text>

<Review>This place is definitely NOT an antique store I’d recommend to friends and family... my first visit was very political and the atmosphere was so uncomfortable that I left... I gave them a second chance tried it out like I do with any store I gave them a second chance and this second chance experience was not a good one so I saw something I really wanted it had no price so they called the vendor they couldn’t get a hold of the vendor so the daughter  told me to write down my name and number so I did... never got a phone call.... I wouldn’t be surprised if she threw my number away. If this place goes out of business it’s no ones fault it’s the owners and staffs fault. It takes months to find a customer and only seconds to lose one.</Review><UserId.>109107540839243495542</UserId.>< Resp>

I've been a customer at Grandpa's Antique Mall for several years, and I think it's one of the best anywhere.  The atmosphere is clean and upbeat, with a great selection of antique, vintage and unusual items at good prices. The busy owners and staff always seem friendly and helpful.  In fact, I just heard that Grandpa's was voted the #2 Best Place To Buy Antiques in the region.  Grandpa's is absolutely a must-do stop for us when we're in Temecula, along with the wineries, shops, and Saturday morning Farmers Market.</text>

Normally people who run antique stores are friendly, quick to help a customer find what they came in to look for.  Not here.  The store opened late, so I went next door first.  When I came back, the employees were all gathered at the front, speaking very loudly, sharing their political points of view.  They did not great me.  They did not offer to help.  Also off-putting is the numerous "do not touch" signs.  I wonder what their typical clientele might be. I will not be back.</Text><Name>Sue Stevens<//Name><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

<Review>The antiques are fine, but the woman working there made me feel as if she didn't trust me. Then when she rang me up, she was very rude. When we told her to have a wonderful day, she looked away from us and said, "yeah." If she has autism, then I'd understand her lack of social skills and empathize, but if not...she makes shopping there an unpleasant experience. I would not pay to have a booth there.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics><Gmap_id>0x80db7fc66aa0623f:0x47714ae537e7089d<//Gmap_id></record>

<text>Grandpa's has EXACTLY what you're looking for... And, if your pocketbook allows.... WAAY more!! I didn't even know I was looking for anything, but I sure found 5 of them! The staff was friendly, VERY accommodating, and made sure my hands were clear to continue my shopping.
A definite recommendation for antique shopping.< /text><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

Very friendly and knowledgeable staff. This store carries a wide variety of collectables and eclectic antiques.
Always stop by when I'm in town. Never know what you'll find.<//review>

<time>1492975229731< /time><review>I agree with others on here not very friendly  and it seemed as if everytime I went to touch something a staff member was on my heels asking if they could help me, but not in a friendly way, I agree with the other reviewer it was like they were afraid I was going to steal something or break something. It made for a very uncomfortable shopping experience! I guess these people don't need or want my shopping dollars.  Grandma's next store is very friendly and has a better selection! I ended up spending $300 there.<//review>< GmapID>

<review>** I'm starting to believe that some of the good reviews left on here are friends of the owners because I just can't see how this place can get any good reviews at all. Dont waste your time and look them up on Yelp also for a more accurate representation of the store** Terrible place. Went in for a visit with my husband and baby. As soon as we walked in we weren't even greeted and lady at the counter looked worried about us bringing in a baby bag as if we were there to steal. The whole shopping experience was awful and we only stayed in about ten minutes. We looked around and began to be followed around the store constantly being watched. We left as soon as we realized what the hell was going on. Please please please dont waste your time with this place. There are plenty of better antique shops in temecula to spend your hard earned dollars at. If I could give it zero stars I would</review><Name>Gabi Cota<//Name></record></dataset><record>

People here will hover over you, they pretend to look at something while they actually just stand 3 feet away and watch every move you make.  Its uncomfortable and makes for a terrible shopping experience, if i could give this place a 0 star I would.  Antique stores are meant to give us a taste of what past lifetimes and past decades were like, and it totally ruins the experience when you have some grouchy old ladies hovering over you. Honestly don't even waste your time, ive been here several times and its always the same, instead of keeping antiques alive they're killing it with their bad attitudes.</text>

Unbelievable! I walked in the door and got no greeting from the 2 people behind the counter. Then a younger woman started following me around just inches from my heels. A couple of times I stopped short just to see if she would run into me. When I went to check out the creeper and some old gross dude were behind the counter. I saw some really ugly handmade posters with VERY offensive stuff about Monica Lewinsky and some pretend money with Obama portrayed as a monkey. I said "wow, somebody doesn't like Clinton" and Morticia Adams said "no, we HATE him!" Literally spit flew out of her mouth! I said "well you must really HATE Trump because he's 100x the adulterer Clinton was!" The both went bats**t. Yelling at me to get out of their store and not come back. Wtaf? Who runs a business that way? Sicking. Wish I could leave zero stars. If you want to be treated well go next door to Granny’s where the smile, laugh, and greet you!</review>

< Review>
Wow. First time calling to ask a question and the woman who answered the phone was in such a hurry to get off the phone, she didn’t even let me finish my question. She cut me off and said I would have to Google it. I will never set foot in this store nor refer anyone to give them business. So unnecessarily rude. I was just trying to ask if they accepted furniture on consignment and if they knew of anyone who reupholstered antique furniture. Not too much to ask an antique store, so I thought.</Review>

Whenever in Temecula we always stop by to rummage around seeking things of interest. My wife is into Toby jugs,  one of my weaknesses is die cast models. We usually come away with something. Unexpectedly we found a lovely rocking chair once that be just had to have.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

<review>The people that run this shop are incredibly rude and unprofessional.  They are not afraid to tell you to your face how terrible of a person they think you are.  Do not waste your time.  There are plenty of other shops around the Temecula area that are much better.< /review>< Pics>

Bought an item, and observed other items that  was later proven to be fake, not an antique. Store clearly states a no-return policy. Store clerk very rude, won't recommend this store to any serious collector.</text>

We were kicked out by the short security guard with no explanation why.  Not only did he confront us like an unstable man, he pounded on my vehicle windows and pulled out his pepper spray. The manager is absolutely childish and threatened to call the sheriffs on me! For a place of medicine, this experience was absolutely everything but peaceful<//text>< Pics>

<Resp>{'time': 1623190401332, 'text': "Hello Madelyn,\n\nWe apologize that you were kicked out for what seems like no reason. Unfortunately, certain persons in your party were hassling the security guard with a noticeably bright flashlight directly in the eyes from inside the vehicle for 15 minutes straight from the beginning of your shopping time until the very end. We understand you perhaps felt it was right to stand up for your party, but you were unaware of the situation, since you were in the shop purchasing the whole time. You were asked to leave the shop because of the misconduct from someone in your party. However, once you began recording the security guard, staff and customers, the entire situation was negatively escalated by violating our guests' privacy and experience with our shop. After the threats received by staff, alerting the Sheriff for our safety was made very clear, yet you and your party refused to leave peacefully.\n\nWe hope everyone can understand the situation in further detail and thank you for shopping with us."}<//Resp>< gmap_id>

<Text>I never really write reviews about dispensarys because I'm usually disappointed with the bud tenders not being very knowledgeable about the products. Here at one plant I was helped by Yesenia her customer service was outstanding and she was extremely knowledgeable about the products that I purchased. Yesenia was very friendly , positive and upbeat . I love the selections they have on pre rolls and the great sales they offer daily my favorite is the buy 3 get one for a penny !! The location is great right off the freeway !! If in the area you should definitely stop by and ask for Yesenia to get welcoming and great service!!<//Text><pics>None</pics><response>{'time': 1617066484386, 'text': 'Hello Shannan!

I love coming here, they're always nice. Check their specials out too, they offer category specials by the day of the week. So you can get deals on products you like by going on the corresponding day, plus they give points for each order so every few visits I get a few bucks off, too. Easy in out no long lines like the others. Local workers, what's not to like?< /review>

<Review>Ive been here a dozen times since I got back to California. I've been trying other places around the bay out as well, but I just keep coming back here. Reasonable pricing, the employees are extremely friendly, and they've helped me solve a couple issues when other places have left me out to dry with bunk product or undeclared proprietary products.</Review>< response>

<text>work in prunetuck and decided to check this place out the other day and me and a coworker bought 2 cartridges each that didn’t work, brought back the next day to be told all sales are final and got half store credit for bunk product. Safe to say we won’t be going back and will let anyone who asks know what’s up. They sell B grade product at best. Sorry guys, gave you a chance to make things right and you lost a customer today!< /text><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

<Review>Poor service and experience I will never be back, their products are also very pricey for the same product I can get elsewhere and save about 25%. And they use the same trick any shady dispensary will do and not include tax in their price. They also had very bad sales techniques (i worked sales for 7years). To simply put it You'll get questions answered with better service and price anywhere else but here. Just go to Castroville (CHAI) and save your wallet.<//Review><UserId.>100509405198251009477<//UserId.>< gmap_id>

<text>Where do I begin, for starters I’d like to say how wonderful & friendly the staff Is, very helpful & informative & knowledgeable about any questions or concern I had. For being an urgent community clinic, the doctors and staff are very fast to attend all patients as I didn’t have to weight more than what I anticipated, the phlebotomist was very friendly & made me feel at ease & answered all questions thoroughly about my lab work.
Thank you Wilmington Urgent Care Clinic!
P.S Lupe is AWESOME!< /text>< rate>

<Review>My girlfriend had an appointment and when showed up they said they cancelled the appointment and that they called earlier in am. She had no missed call or voicemail and when she asked the front desk lady did they leave a voicemail? Her response was its not our fault you didn't answer, if you seen a missed call you should have called it back! She admitted to leaving no voicemail.How professional is that? They have left her voicemails in past. If you cancel a patient's appointment the courteousanf professional  thing to do if you can't reach them is leave a message</Review></record>

<Text>The worst place. Don’t cake here. Every time you came to the office is always a different doctor. Every visit you have to explain your history. The signed referrals, prescribed medication with a factor name Payam but he never see you it’s always students or side doctor. They told you that they take the last patient at 6 but If you arrive at 5:45pm they willl no take you. If you need a referral they never send the referrals to your endurance. Most of the stuff are students from harbor occupational health center. This school is not even a university or college. It only takes 1 year to complete a medical assistance degree.<//Text><userid>105060950759856891093<//userid><date>1581559611418</date>< response>
{'time': 1581790780167, 'text': 'Dear Lizeth! Thank you for your review and inputs. We have one of the best clinics  and growing very fast. Patients love us but unfortunately we cannot please every patient. We had a busy day with patients flow and we had no choice to divert the patients before the closing time. We have students because our clinic is the best teaching center and the surrounding hospitals and clinics also use students. Your referrals were entered correctly on time. Your insurance company takes time to process it and this is out of our control. And of course due to high quality of patient care we provide, we have to be asking about your medical history on each visit!!! Best Wishes!'}</response>

Ian so bless today that I went to this urgent care in Wilmington . My mom is visiting from El Salvador. She forgot her meds for blood pressure and her blood pressure. At the front desk was an amazing and kindly person  Norma . She help me to put my mom under the care right away. After seeing Linda the doctor I feel 100% that my mom will be on her staying more secure here. I really appreciate what this lady doctor is doing for my mom ..Very kindly doctor. I will definitely think to have them as my primary clinic pretty soon. Thank you Norma and Dr Linda❤️< /Text>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) I based on some reviews to make a virtual appointment because to start in person there was no availability. My appointment was for 12:30. I received the confirmation and I waited for the video call and at 2:00 in the afternoon I decided to speak to them and the girl who answered me tells me that the doctors were at a conference. I never received a call to let me know that they would not make the appointment. They suggested that I go back to make the appointment online that at that time they had no patients. Definitely zero recommended.

(Original)
Me base en algunas reseñas para hacer una cita virtual porque para empezar en persona no había disponibilidad. Mi cita era para las 12.30 recibí la confirmación y espere la videollamada y al dar las 2 de la tarde decidí hablarles y me comenta la chica que me contesto que los doctores estaban en una conferencia. Nunca recibí una llamada para avisarme que no me harían la cita. Me sugirióeron que volviera ha hacer la cita en línea que en ese momento no tenían pacientes.  Defintivamente cero recomendados.<//Review>

Best sandwich spot around! The hot pastrami sandwiches are the go-to favorites in my family. The flavors are just so mouth-watering. Can’t go wrong with that order. Even the pickles are scrumptious! And the owner is super nice. He makes an effort to remember everyone’s names. You’ll love your experience here!<//review>

Cannot say enough positive things about Rims Deli! David runs a top-notch operation. Staff is always friendly, quality of the food is always excellent. Try the seafood sandwich, it does not disappoint! Do yourself a favor and stop by.<//text>

This place is my number one site.  Of all restaurants I know I love it most. I never miss an opportunity to go to visit this restaurant. Whenever  I feel like having a delicious lunch, this is the place that comes instantly to my mind.  Great and all kinds of  food and a rich cuisine.generous staff members, and good ambience. Not less important, the tariff is affordable. I recommend this place with no hesitation.< /text>

It's really good sandwiches man, what more could you ask for? Like seriously some of the best sandwiches I've had. try the ruebin because it's fantastic. They also have a really nice selection of drinks and chips and all in all it's just a fantastic place to get a good lunch.< /Review>

<Time>1523196554611< /Time><review>The wait was a little long for my lunch break, but the line was almost out the door, so to be expected. Totally worth it though. Ordered the grilled tuna sandwich. One of the best sandwiches I ever ate. They have a cooler with delicious specialty sodas that's worth a look. Service is good despite how busy they are. The owner is nice and didn't rush me through my order. Definitely going back.< /review><resp>None< /resp></record></dataset><record>

We were hot, sweaty and hungry and I can tell you Rim's was the perfect spot to cure all that ailed me. I ordered the #3, a mortadella and provolone on a roll. The bread was fresh, mortadella sliced thin and piled high. It was delicious... especial after dousing it with a decent about of their Italian dressing and some yellow mustard. The soda I order, diet coke, was cold and hit the spot. But if you was a craft root beer or orange cream soda, they have plenty of those craft type sodas to choose from as well. The price was right for what you get and absolutely delicious. The sandwich chains don't have anything on Rim's. Oh one last thing, I was amazed by the staffs ability to stay busy. There was several young adults that kept busy the entire time, most notably when there were no customers to help. I really appreciated that as a retail manager myself. Anyway, if you in the mood for a good deli style sandwich and good service, give Rim's a try!< /review>< gmap_id>

Nice to know that you can still get a NORMAL, non-trendy sandwich somewhere that simply tastes great because the ingredients are fresh and delicious.<//text>< pictures>

< Review>
The owner feels that senior citizens nor veterans that have been in wars to defend our country do not deserve any benefits at his store as many other businesses give. Other businesses provide discounts and appreciate seniors and veterans. The quality of his food does not deserve the high prices he charges. His lack of appreciation of seniors and vets who put their lives on the line will visit businesses who have appreciation and not his. His purpose is to get as much money as he can and does not care for those who should be honored.<//Review>

<review>This place is fantastic I've been going here ever since I worked at Hancock Fabrics which used to be down at the end. David (the owner) is awesome he's very friendly , knows you by your 1st name, quick at taking orders & the cook is fast too they have delicious sandwiches especially the pastrami but mi favorite I always get is the grilled turkey bacon swiss!!! Yumm
Idc if anyone says it's expensive its just better quality than Subway, Beach Hut (is expensice too) Jersey Mikes or Firehouse subs!!!< /review></record></dataset><record>

The other deli sandwich shop was closed  so we googled sandwiches nearby and Rim's Deli came up.  We had the pastrami​ and our son had BLT, with cheese instead of tomatoes.  We got extra cheese and pastramy, we were sorry we hadn't tried Rim's Deli sooner.   Well worth the visit.  Fastest service ever, they had our sandwiches before we sat down.  Highly recomend.<//Text><pics>None< /pics><resp>None</resp>< gmapID>

A great Thai spot near The Village! We always get fantastic customer service here. The owner is great with substitutions (vegan, dairy free, etc). He is always accommodating and helpful. The food is always super fresh and delicious! The lunch special is a great bargain and the perfect size (not too big). Definitely recommend supporting this local restaurant! 10/10

*Note: photos show 1) green curry with tofu 2) vegetables and ginger 3) fried wontons<//Review>

I love their pineapple curry and also tried their sister kitchen curry. I personally prefer the pineapple curry and it was delicious. The sister kitchen curry was good but not as good. Also, the 4 star rating is due to slow service. It was a busy Friday night but it took forever for our order to be taken and a long time before our food came out. It was worth the wait though. So if you are a patient person and love Thai food, go check it out 😊<//text>

ALWAYS THE BEST! This has been my favorite Thai place since we moved to SLO county 15 years ago. The quality has never wavered, I always tell people it's the bat Thai food I've ever had and they don't believe me till they try it. Nothing compares. My dad had some weird falling out with the owner 5 years ago and it's so good that the rest of the family still goes behind his back. I've lived in a bunch of states and this remains the greatest Thai restaurant of them all. Tiny, run by like one guy and a kitchen person, but absolutely stellar each time. I make an effort to eat here whenever I'm in town visiting again.<//review>

Very good service. Friendly staff.
Food doesn't take forever to get served.
A bit to small portions to what I am used to at another places.

My sautéed vegetables (trying to be low-cal) with beef had a LOT of pieces of beef—after reading here that someone thought they skimped on the protein. And it was very tender, not dry or over-cooked or cheap. My family all ordered the pineapple fried rice and enjoyed it—with both shrimp and plenty of chicken. Great value for the low cost. It would be 5 stars if it just wasn’t so tiny. You can’t bring a crowd very easily.</text><Resp>None< /Resp><gmap_id>0x80ec5e8f34e66f79:0x1c2bc9fedd8402d2</gmap_id>< Rating>

Great food. Very nice people, especially Bert. Always ready when they say it will be, for takeout. Nice and quiet atmosphere. Not spicy at all unless you specify. Didn’t care for Thai food til I tried this place. Now it’s a favorite.<//review>

Decent food and close proximity to where we live. However, inconsistently when you go there 30-45 minute prior to closing they are hesitant to sit you for dining.  Couple times I’ve called to make sure they were open and when I got there the door was locked.  I called and they said they don’t sit anymore since it’s 8:30pm and only take out.  If your internet and business listing says you close at 9:00pm you should allow your customer to go in and eat.  Or at least mention it on the phone that it’s only take out after certain time at night.<//text>

This is a tiny, cute place. Food is good, but the portions are not generous by many American's standards. I loved it. Service is good. Drink menu could have some help. No soda fountain drinks, just overpriced cans. Tea is very good.<//review>

<text>I usually eat very spicy curry. I asked for mild green curry due to my stomach being more sensitive to spice lately. It was the spiciest curry Ive ever had and I couldnt even eat it, was watery, and had barely any chicken. My husbands yellow curry had no spice to it (he asked for it hot), also was watery, and mock duck was chewy. Not sure if they mixed up our spice levels (even though we double checked when picking up), but still wouldnt reccomend.< /text><user_name>Bethany Bancroft< /user_name>< user_id>

I love Thai Kitchen. I little charming building in the Village of Arroyo Grande, unassuming but packed with so much yummy goodness. I love their lunch specials. Their cuchee curry, cashew chicken, spicy noodle and coconut soup are some of my favorites. They treat their customers really well and service is prompt and fast. Takeout is also available. My only complaint, can soda :( no refills, please get a soda machine.< /text>

<Review>After driving by this place hundreds of times, I finally tried it out when another Thai place in town was too busy to take my order. I am so glad I did because I love this place! I have had a dozen or so items on the menu and everything has been delicious. When I call in, the food is always ready when they say it will be and usually in 10-15 mins. I have only sat down to eat once and the food did seem to take a bit longer, but I don't mind waiting when I know how good it will be. It may be small and look a little shady, but don't let that fool you. With so many sub-par food establishments in the area, it is nice to find someplace that not only has good food, but good service, too.</Review>< name>

Food is ok but they consistently scrimp on the protein part of the dish you order. Like every time. Chicken chow mein has less than 1/4 of a small breast. Any chicken dish ordered has maybe a half ounce of meat. The service is slow and they have to be asked 2-3 times for simple things like ice for your water. I only order from them for take out now and only because they are around the corner from my house. Spend your money at Sister Kitchen. Priced same but huge portions.</review>

Meh.  Heard it was great so I gave it a try.  I was disappointed just not what I expect from Thai food.  With so many good Thai restaurants around I don't think I'll come back.< /Text>

I love thos place. I usually order green curry but they are all good. Orange chicken is amazing wife loves pad see yu. I must say out of the 20 or 30 times being here I've never had  a bad experience. Closed on Wednesdays. My daughter loves the choo chi curry it is really mild.</text>

We love hanging out. Last night we  found this delicious restaurant which we didn’t know before. We had a delightful evening there with fine cooking and a courteous crew and  a professional cook. We  added this place in our list  and we will surely visit again soon.  Highly recommended.</Text>

<Review>Amazing Italian spot that you must visit! Kids love the pizza, the service is fast, and the food is perfect! I me the owner Kim, he's truly an awesome guy and the fact that he checked in with us to see how our dining experience was is huge to me. Roxanne was our server, and she gave the perfect recommendations for our meals, and was very knowledgeable of the menu. This place is so delicious I had to take a pizza to go because as I ate every pizza that passed me looked so impressive. I tried the veal, my wife had the salmon plate, we shared the mussels, and the octopus was a must try.< /Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNKK21QlRHL5eoAiNOcXjZ1MJHncO-7r9ZLnen2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN4aVx62G4JTsz4aV2A_A_fc1UaeusC2iCEunVX=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPqZ-2BpTi4MQQqJT2UwItatsoTwF7bSqVIL7PO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPmVCr1ED4Sg11kdd_iwk7X82A5I3Bd4y5jDIIx=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNDJhq9sa_AelROwj2f7u4eH4dVBbD18cEEh4m0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOgvHzLysG4LFyaNSXroG5A3RNJ0cVLy3cW9fQt=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOqrAzxWcMMy7Cbj5dPabVa3V1lUGdSzlC2AIE0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOMoC8I3n_FIOafNesAwyQFWVG2eMOClV9Kwv85=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMIC_107zdHUzlKUzhSa1tAesxQm6T005nVWjgA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOa9gR7dhAT-WB_DWCYBap_y3UxFV-f8LNEPcxY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP3ltTp-CmGhC5KCa52PcvRYqackvyYhvDMzNuz=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNjMs88P8pUShuAZo1LPcaL8OLWUtAmgnjzD9st=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOQugTPJWagmGg_DQNL5A95fYxDV7Mj0yPcw-18=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMWLZLX8rQRpQOSY_39b7311WPW-v5qdhTegP5_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNoJ4RrPcSuV6RIRS4hf1t8SCLbLFAqamiCiMlw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM3K71ad28o7B_kBaUvrT3qhPZsJPAnF0gdvPwr=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOOOXTMh4XNG_eD2_zSlO_HAEqW9jX_odFN9qkz=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPGKXoj7UUUq8oYfTDUvvphfPSxUFi8r5BSrT4I=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMRFpplhqE6m5Eab6Qo3fChYqxwi14ycI4gjhJA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMYZmneIUx1GNkTnUh4Ye1xsEIxKUQmJlHaFjjH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMUF_aKY8xWjce4K6jIRdn7fPZuSrYQPi77jKww=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO-VaTe1ThZ_p_fRvMwZFaieknJTVnv1_3oLXcX=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPv7J8QIESpBNQrFnDsmg9KEJjfUPUJrXbaRAEY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics>< resp>

I have been to a lot of Italian restaurants and this is top notch. I had the meat lovers pizza and I could see and hear them making the pizza fresh. Perfect blend of taste and texture. The pasta was the bomb!!!!! And the meatball appetizer was very well done too. I love the music and feel and the decor. Our waiter was amazing and very attentive. For sure a place you need to go for a meal when visiting Oceanside</Review>

It was our first restaurant dinner since the pandemic started, and everything was delicious. The staff was very nice and helpful, telling us where not to park and suggesting dinner choices. Our table was outside but they had heaters and it was cozy enough.  Evan, our waiter was very nice and kept his cool and professionalism even when I thought he had way too much pressure on him. Thank you Blade 1936 for a perfect first night out in Oceanside!</Text>

My husband and I just had a wonderful dinner here on our last of 10 nights in Oceanside. We wish we had found it sooner. We would definitely have dined here more than once!
The food is authentic Italian with fresh ingredients and  plentiful quantities.
The server was friendly and efficient.
The menu is extensive and prices are very reasonable.
We look forward to dining here on our next trip to the area!<//Text>

The chef is from Italy and it shows when you have any of the delicious items from the classic Italian menu. Everything tastes so good and authentic-- you don't have to go to Italy for it! The patio is spacious and lets you feel relaxed, especially during Covid. The entire staff is super friendly and makes us feel well taken care of whenever we dine here.< /text>< pics>

<Review>The food was absolutely delicious. We sat outside as a family of 7 and we had a whole team of people assisting including the manager (or maybe owner) checking on us regularly. We ordered a wide array of food from the squid ink scallop special to meat lovers pizza, mussels to meatballs and everything was delicious. Especially as an Italian family who is very picky, we truly enjoyed our experience and will be back again next time we’re in town .< /Review>< Pictures>

<review>When Blade first opened it was delicious and the customer service was awesome. It quickly became our go-to for Italian in Oceanside. Unfortunately, the last three times have been way less than subpar. From the service to the food. Our last couple meals, pesto gnocchi x3 because their gnocchi was delish, was bland and eh. We are looking for a new Italian Oside place to serve our needs.</review></record>

Not authentic Italian! Tasted more like dried out frozen pizza with cardboard as the crust. Dont waste yoir money. My husband complained it was like eating wet cardboard. Supposedly Everything tastes good when youre starving and after being locked down for a year long pandemic, not this! You will have Better Luck, happier taste buds and a content tummy going to The Privateer down the road,  Manja!! Manja!! now thats Italiano!! Salud🥂< /review>

They made sure there  were flowers and champagne on the table when we arrived and provided great service the entire dinner. Special thanks to the hostess Grace who made the whole thing happen as well as the owner who was more than happy to help us celebrate this occasion. The food and champagne was amazing as always.< /review><Pics>None</Pics>< date>

One of the best cappuccinos we've enjoyed to close the evening with tiramisu of course. Great atmosphere, authentic staff, a visit with one of the owners at the end of our dinner. Our daughter who spent a semester in Florence was in heaven. Love that our home town finally has a great restaurant scene</review>

<Text>The menu for this restaurant looked fantastic! I was so hoping this would be our new “go to” place. The food was not disappointing. However, the service experience was a big let down. It took our server quite a long time to approach us about drinks. I wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt. They were quite busy, and maybe he didn’t know we had been seated. I think the restaurant likely let the server down by being understaffed. Unfortunately, this trend continued the rest of the night. We had to flag him down for basic things like ordering our appetizers. He was also always rushing while at our table. I felt like I had to get my questions out quickly or he may walk away. I think I could have tolerated the experience much better had the server at least focused on us and been “excited” about our experience while at our table. He seemed very miserable to be there. The quality of the food was eclipsed by this experience. I wish we could have even gotten a, “I’m sorry that we are short staffed tonight. Please feel free to flag me down,” or “I apologize for your long wait, we had someone call in sick.” The food may potentially bring us back again to give it another shot, but we have a lot of others on our list to try first.< /Text><userid>116735414451057593804<//userid><username>Brittany Kelley< /username>< Resp>

I spent a wonderful birthday with my wife and friends.  The staff was friendly and attentive. The osobucco was delicious and aromatic. My wife had an excellent pepperoni pizza which reminded me of a New York pizza. Our friend had an arugula salad with grilled salmon. The salmon portions was more than expected for the price which was refreshing. The drinks were superb: the wine was devine due to well-deserved recommendations and the IPA beer, which is not one preferred beers, was surprising. The Artifact IPA is must try. Definitely will come back and recommend to anyone. Price matches value. The restaurant decor was cool and pub like. I’d encourage everyone to come here for a date night or special occasion.</Text>

Best pizza in town. It’s reasonably priced for the quality you’re getting. I can eat a whole pizza and don’t feel sluggish afterwards. Make sure to get the pineapple sorbet, it’s delicious. Thanks to everyone who works hard at Blade providing our community with a place to enjoy excellent authentic Italian food.<//review>

< Review>
Came here with my partner for his birthday, we got the meat and cheese antipasto and the fried cauliflower to start. I highly recommend the cauliflower, SO GOOD. Even the aoli was good, and I generally don’t care for them. The rest of the meal was equally delicious, I had the chicken Marsala and my partner had a pizza. The food was amazing, but our service was top notch. Our waitress Brittney(sorry not sure which way to spell) went above and beyond, she even made his cannoli for dessert. Also amazing. Definitely will be back to try out other menu items and enjoy such amazing customer service.<//Review>

I've had to eat gluten free for the last 10 years. This place has the best gluten free pizza I've had so far! It is even better the gluten free pizza I had while visiting Italy. Not only are the toppings and sauces outstanding, but the crust is better than I remember gluten full crust tasting like. If you love Italian food and are on a gluten free diet, do yourself a favor and try Blade 1936!!!!<//text>

<Review>Finally got a chance to visit Blade 1936.   Since hearing about their indoctrination into the Associazione Verace Pizza Napoletana (AVPN), which formally certifies their pizza as true, authentic Neapolitan pizza (one of only two in San Diego), I've been enthusiastically wanting to try out their pies.

We are surrounded by pizza joints - one near every corner it seems, and most of them are frankly sub-par.  Sure, even frozen pizza can taste okay, but you want the BEST.

I've learned that my favorite style of pizzas are either true deep-dish Chicago style, thin & greasy New York style (where you have to "fold" the pizza to eat it), OR Neapolitan style, where the outer crust is bubbly in some places, slightly burnt in other, crispy on the outside & fluffy on the inside all while being thin in the middle.  It's a very specific style of pizza.

Blade 1936, named after the 84 year old Blade-Tribune newspaper building they took over, is a great new addition to the Oceanside food scene.  They sit on Seagaze Avenue behind the large AMC multiplex downtown.  Parking wasn't too difficult to find, in fact we parked on the street right near the building.

They have a large patio dining section on the side of the place, but we chose to sit inside.  Seats are PADDED, too!  I can't tell you how important I think it is that restaurants make the decision to offer padded seats.  Save the metal chairs for breweries and other joints where you're drunk enough not to care how much your butt hurts.

We ordered some wine for the wife, a cocktail for me (the "Rumblepony" with Rum & Campari).  I actually wanted a beer instead, but wasn't impressed with the short selection of draft options (they also have a few bottles).  Most seemed to be IPAs.  There was a Peroni and Dolomiti on the bottle beer list, so keep that in mind.  Would like to see more draft options, or at least a better variety...

For an appetizer, we chose the "Polenta e Salsiccia" (Polenta with Fennel Sausage in a pink sauce).  I don't remember the last time I had polenta, but this dish makes me forget all the other times I've had it.  This was excellent.  The slight grittiness of the polenta matched well with the creamy pink sauce that was bustling with tasty bits of sausage.  We ate it all.

My wife ordered the Pappardelle Bolognese, and I had to try the Truffle Pizza (it was National Truffle Day afterall).  Both were excellent.  The pizza doesn't have any meat but it doesn't even need it.  The freshness of the arugula atop the puffy, slightly charred dough was magical with the slight flavor of truffle, mushrooms and mozzarella.

The pasta was excellent as well, and side note:  the leftovers tasted even better the next day.

Service was excellent.

I really liked the newspaper references located here and there inside.  At the end, even the receipt is served in a leather-bound tray that boasts a vintage, "newpapery" background.

If you check-in on Yelp, you'll get $5 off the bill.

Overall I really enjoyed Blade.  There are several flat-screen TVs around if you need to catch a game.  Some quiet Italian music in the background might be cool, however cliché.  It's a smallish restaurant which probably seems that way due to social distancing.  I do wish the bar was a tad larger, but overall I was quite pleased with the food & service.  Looking forward to the next meal ;-)<//Review>< username>

Pizza flavor is amazing! Crust is a bit soggy, could be stiffer. Got the Margherita pizza. Nice decor inside the restaurant. Pricing is a bit high.</review>

I ordered the procuitto and burrata appetizer, rigatoni, brussel sprouts and tiramisu which was all excellent. Second the staff. The staff was attentive, welcoming and had great suggestions. Third was the safety protocols. I dined on the back patio and felt that every covid precaution was respected. I felt safe and was able to truly enjoy my experience.<//text>< user>

When this restaurant was able to accept dine in after shelter in place, our friends recommended us to come here. We came for dine in. It was a big place, outside dining as well. We got the meat lovers pizza, polenta, pappardelle with sausage, and a calamari to share. They were out of their bison meatball. Darn. But everything was really good! The calamari fried right and had some shrimps too. My pappardelle was good. Pizza was a Neapolitan style, plenty of toppings. Next time we coming to make our own pasta dish!!< /Text>

The serving of their food is very substantial. Also, the staff are very attentive. Ordering and getting the bill is relatively faster than in other restaurants despite the place being always jam-packed with people. I strongly recommend this restaurant.</Text>

Service was great, beer selection was good but could have been a little better. I love that they have gnocchi and that you can choose the sauce. If there's anything to improve then honestly it's just that it could use a little extra sun-dried tomatoes with the pesto gnocchi... Overall it was great though. I'll definitely go back.<//text>

OMG!! My Husband and I dined in on our first visit here and we we're shocked at all fabulous the flavors our taste buds experienced here! We had the Antipasto Salad, Meat Lover's Pizza and the Blueberry Cheesecake. The most delightful dine in experience and superb food we've ever had! We would like to send a special thank you to Brittany for her polite and friendly hospitality. We will definitely be back!😊< /review>

<Text>I had high hopes for Blade 1936 because my wife and I were excited about its opening for months in advance.  My first impression was it's a cool spot with great atmosphere but once we were seated we quickly realized that they tried to cram too many small tables together to the point that it is uncomfortable.  They should work on the table arrangement and put in a few booths to utilize the space better.
We just ordered an appetizer and a pizza and everything would not fit on our tiny table. The food was below average as we have much better Italian restaurant options in the area. If we return it will only be for wine or cocktails.</Text>< Pics>

EXCELLE NT SERVICE. Great patio dining and breezes off ocean. Smaller portions but loved strawberry salad with golden beets, almonds and champagne vinaigrette. Tiramisu made to order, light fluffy and delicious. Avg cost $10 each including desserts. Worth it!</Text>

<Resp>None<//Resp><text>Amazing new restaurant in downtown Oceanside! They restored the old Oceanside Blade newspaper building into an italian restaurant. The decor and layout is open and retro artsy.  The food is incredible! We went for the Taste of Oceanside and they were the standout. The shredded beef raviolis were sooo good as was the margherita pizza. Chef warmly greeted everyone and staff was very attentive. Can't wait to try their full menu!<//text>< Rating>

<text>We've gotten take out from Blade 1936 a couple of times and been really impressed. It's unfortunate we live 20 minutes away, otherwise we would be eating here more often.

Our second time we tried the Affumicata pizza. (Pictured below) It was delicious. The smokiness from the mozzarella was just the right amount. We previously had the Zest pizza which was also really good.

The fresh pappardelle with funghi was a hit. Last time we had this sauce with the gnocchi which I preferred to the pappardelle for this particular sauce. The pappardelle was great.

My wife enjoyed the Verdure spaghetti and thought it was a good vegetarian option.</text>< Pics>

It doesn’t get better than Blade!!!! We are from the east coast originally and finding good Italian food in SoCal is somewhat of a joke. UNTIL... Blade opened!! Wow. We have never had a bad meal here, everything is spot on, fresh, and jaw dropping delicious! Highly recommend their specialties which are pasta & pizza (slight obsession w the Vegan Pesto sauce) but you can’t go wrong with anything. The pasta is charred to perfection and the pasta is so fresh you’ll wonder why you ever ate boxed pasta. Like EVER. I tried the vegan fried cauliflower last night and O.M.G. not only was it perfect, but also, I found another sauce I could drink from a bottle - that lemon sauce! I’ll take 100 sides of that next time pls. Anyway, get here and be prepared to be blown away. Oh and save room for dessert! 😋< /Text>

This was the building that housed the Tribune,  Blade, newspaper. It has been nicely transformed into a comfortable,  Italian Restaurant. We tried the chopped salad, and the Spaghetti Bolunase for our meal. Both were played nicely and were full of wonderful flavors. We had Tiramisu after our meal
It was fluffy and light and full of creamy goodness. Nice friendly staff.</Review>

Stopped by here on a Friday night and they were busy but glad we were able to get a table for two.

Our server was very nice and attentive. Wish I got her name to give her props.

•Blade Dueling Caprese
•Pork Chop, Grilled Romaine and Mushrooms.
•Spaghetti Bolognese

The caprese was refreshing and I wasn't sure how I would like the watermelon but it went well together.

The pork chop was tender and cooked at  medium temperature.  Flavors were great and not overly seasoned. Yummy!

Tupac had the Bolognese and he ate his whole plate so I'm sure he loved every bite.

Overall, a beautiful fun atmosphere and great restaurant to dine at.< /review><user_name>Nette Rab<//user_name>< Rate>

Finally open! The chef from this restaurant comes from Milan. I first tasted his food at the excellent Bice restaurant in downtown San Diego. Good food at reasonable prices. Fast service. 4.5-stars</review>

Little Italy experience in North County. Enjoy the ambiance and flavors of the most prestigious Little Italy restaurants in the comfort and pleasant views of North County. You dont need to spend the price of a dish on parking here like you do in San Diego proper. The house made pasta and pizzas are incredible and the dedication to the old world flavirs are evident in the house made sauces and pastas. Clever blends of ingredients on the flat breads make for exciting and enjoyable meals. With the oceanside puer and other great spots within walking distance, Blade is definitely a must see when touring Oceanside.< /Text>

My nit picky critique is some of the art on the walls is kind of strange & I wish they did away with the TVs, and the lighting could be a bit softer. All & all I feel like they have a great place and guests look happy. Just some minor decor stuff< /review>< Pics>

Awesome place with an awesome menu! They have a ton to choose from vegan, non vegan items and even gluten free. Everything was very delicious! They had great customer service! They staff was very friendly and very quick with everything. They quickly cleared things and brought new things out. Everything was presented very nicely. Portions were a good size. Pizzas were very fresh and taste. Great place! We loved it!</Text>

Decided to try a new place with friends last night and was not disappointed! Fantastic appetizers, bottle of amazing wine, food to die for and sinful dessert! The staff was awesome....we cannot wait to eat our way through the entire BOMB menu and will definitely put this in our rotation! We loved BLADE!<//review>

<Text>Let me start off by saying I've been following them on IG since they've opened. I no longer live in Carlsbad but I come back yearly and have been wanting to check them out. Meatball appetizer ($12) not very good. Ordered the Divers Scallops and it was literally the smallest scallops I've ever seen, smaller then the size of a quarter ($28)...had to question the waitress if I received the correct order and she apologized for the size and offered to add on a side order of pasta. Ordered the Salsiccia pizza ($15) and liked it, it was more crust then toppings but I enjoyed the chewy crust & flavorful sauce & sausage. Ordered the watermelon caprese salad ($12) and it was ok. Ordered other items (came with 3 other people). Pros: The craft cocktails were great, the tiramisu was great, the service was great. But unfortunately overall, it was a disappointment.< /Text>< pics>

We had a great time at Blade! I ordered the Saffron Scallops with Risotto, and it was perfect. We didn’t have a reservation, so we ate at the bar, and that worked out great. Awesome staff and food. Will definitely go back to Blade!</text>

Good pasta, a boisterous environment and friendly service. First time visiting. The menu is full of tasty things. The neighborhood is up and coming and parking can be rough as there is a massive movie theater across the street. Still, if you have a chance you should check it out.< /text>

< Review>
Excellent experience and all my travel companions loved the food there.  Anywhere I can get handmade pasta or pizza, I try to hit up when I travel.  All of the food did not dissappoint, and many of us went back for a second time.  Great happy hour specials, sangria, and old world wines and beers as well.  Also enjoyed the old printing press art decco buildinf and ambiance.   My compliments, wish I had a place like this. Ps, the gnocci and parpardelle were excellent.<//Review>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Review>I haven’t had a good pizza since I left Brooklyn 3 years ago until tonight. Being a chef and a New Yorker my taste in food is very hard to please. The crust and dough was perfect, and the sauce  tasted just like it should. Their wine selection was very well thought out with a terrific selection of white and reds to choose from. The service was very good and friendly. I was also very impressed when the bill came and how reasonable it was for all that we ordered. Looking forward to going back

Bar service wasn't good, they mostly stood around taking to each other.

The bison meatballs were great, otherwise just decent Italian food at decent prices.< /Review>

< Review>
I’ve dined here at least six times since it opened sitting mostly at the bar. The food is good but not great. On my last visit I realized that one of the main ingredients in the pasta special I ordered was missing. The bartender checked with the cook who said he forgot to add it. PERIOD. lt was the lack of concern that bothers me, not the missing asparagus.</Review>

The wine and food was delicious! The server was so sweet and we had multiple servers checking up on us throughout dinner. It was a bit pricey - but you can get a house wine during happy hour for $4 which is amazing! I didn't know what to expect from the look of the outside, but the inside is adorable and spacious.< /text>

Went to Blade with our son visiting from East Coast.
We loved the building, the vibe, the knowledgeable friendly staff, and the food was delicious! We were passing our plates around and actually laughing with joy at how special it was. Going to be regulars!</Review>

This is a new place in downtown Oceanside. Location is good since it's right behind the theater but the parking is a challenge given it's downtown. The decor is nice and it's nicely set up to accommodate large gathering. The food was good. I had the bruschetta and it's super tasty! I also had tasted the quinoa paella and it's okay but I'm used to having it with rice! I ordered the chicken with ham and cheese inside (can't remember the name) it was good but it's a little too salty for my taste.</Review>

our servicer Griffin was super friendly and our service was great. My lunch meal was the Rustica panini, delicious! and my drink was the white sangria, refreshing good which paired well with food. Food portion good! I was too full for dessert!
We loved the atmosphere, light and a nice urban look to it. We will definitely return. Looking forward to dessert, my favorite the cannoli< /review>

Blade 1936 closes that gap.  Great food from start to finish.

The food is great and the service is okay, but it is SO loud in the restaurant. We could not get through the dinner and had to box up the meal when it came and leave. It spoiled our dinner. We were bummed because it could be a great place, but the dinner was completely ruined because we could not hear anything at all. We will not come back unless they can fix the problem.</Review>

<rate>5< /rate><review>Blade is a newer restaurant so service is still off when it gets busy but, the food comes out fast and oh man is it amazing. It is a higher end Italian style food but, it is priced more for the Oceanside area instead of del Mar. The Carbonara pizza was beautiful. The crust is perfect, egg with the runny yolk...wow. I can't believe they don't do a Carbonara pasta. I'm sure it would be excellent. The truffle and mushroom gnocchi was like eating savory, creamy marshmallows. The texture of their gnocchi was so light you find you can eat more then you think. The staff was very nice and welcoming with a varied and well priced wine list. Dessert was very pleasant and felt European without being too sweet. An excellent Oceanside eatery that I hope stays around.</review><pics>None<//pics><resp>None< /resp>< GmapID>

Birthday party last night. Ordered the pasta special which was suppose to have italian sausage and rapini. It maybe had 2 miniscule pieces of sausage and one tiny piece of rapini. It was just pasta. Nothing special. I would expect more at $15.00 a plate. Also very noisy inside. We wont go back. Not worth the money! Sorry.. you guys have to do better!< /Review>

<text>Been here about 5 times since it opened and I want to give it a 5 star really badly (because food is very good, more on that below), however, everytime I go I am frustrated by the service. 3 out of the 5 times I have gone the server uses a little tablet to put in orders. They are ALWAYS so distracted putting in the order and trying to work the gadget that we have never had a personable or nice encounter with our server and 2 out of the 3 times they used this gadget our order was wrong because they pressed the wrong thing or were not listening because they were frustrated by the thing. You almost can always tell the server is upset or annoyed with having to use it. It is a big distraction!!!

The food though, that is good!!! Love the Prosciutto and Burrata appetizer (miss the basil with it though, it seems to have been switched out for arugula, but still so good!). The pizzas are always tasty!

Beer menu needs help! More beer options needed, local beer options would be best.

The building is really cool, love the atmosphere, especially the back room. The artwork (multicolored food pictures) in the main room and quite odd and don't really understand how they go with the place!

I am not a crazy nitpicky person, just love the new food places coming up in Oside and the service thing makes me sad. Oside is homey and feels like a small surf town and this service feels like downtown busy (not as friendly) San Diego service.<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

<Text>One of the best Italian food restaurants in oceanside and one of the best restaurants in downtown oceanside. They wood fire their calzones and pizzas which give off a nice smoky flavor. Their salads are really fresh. My favorite salad was made with duck prosciutto in it which gave it a sweet palet, but whenever I go there I always try a new one.

<review>Took my father in law here for his birthday this past Sunday, service was phenomenal but their version of vegan and or gluten free was lacking. I ordered a pasta dish, vegan and gluten free, got less pasta than the non vegan counter part ordered by my father in law, almost no vegetables, almost no sauce.  My wife’s vegan dish was good but almost no vegetables and the same almost no sauce.

I always give a place a second chance so, took my wife tonight for date night. Drinks were good, small mistake made with our appetizer but easily fixed. It was the main courses that were again, lacking.  Vegan pizza, with their regular crust I might add, was sparing with the vegetable for a roasted vegetable pizza. Crust was good but soggy in the middle of the pie. I ordered vegan and gluten free paella. I got quinoa with chunks of halved grape tomatoes, asparagus, mushrooms, peas, cannelli beans, and some kind of pickled radish strips.  No crust, like the bottom of the pan, no tomato sauce, almost no flavor at all.  Waiter could barely hear our complaints and gave us a free round of drinks.

I do not recommend.  Go to Bagby Beer Company instead.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

<date>1568958140952< /date><Rating>5<//Rating><review>Just went to Blade 1936 for the soft opening. Had the Caprese duo which had Watermelon (on top of heirloom tomatoes) and it was delicious, a very fresh taste that brought something very interesting to an italian classic. There was also some lotus root chips served alongside the appetizer, and those are addicting... Trust me you cannot only have one...

After, had the vegetarian Quinoa Paella, very flavorful and the vegetables were cooked perfectly. A healthy option that did not lack in flavors.

Dessert was the pear almond tart which was very good and really well presented. Definitely a great choice coming up for dinner in Oceanside.</review><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None</Response><Gmap_id>0x80dc6fbe591c055f:0x666d5b965c348cdf</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

< review>
Four of us tried Blade the other night for the first time. We were very impressed. The food, service, prices, and the decor are all outstanding! Make a reservation if you can... it helps. I don't remember which pizza my friend got, but he wanted MEAT and he was quite happy with his. His wife got the papperdelle bolognese and I got the ravioli bolognese. My wife got the caprcciosa pizza (artichokes and black olives). I also had the Blade chopped salad. It was absolutely delicious! For $8, you won't find a nicer dinner salad. Lots of fresh ingredients with a light lemon dressing. I' a big fan of Italian food and Blade 1936 is a notch up from most of the others in the area. We've only been once, so I'll reserve further judgement til later. Loved it.< /review>

<Text>We found this little Italian restaurant while in Oceanside. We ordered the marguerita pizza, parpadelle verdure, salsiccia pizza (fennel sausage). The sizes of the pizza is enough to feed 2 people. The cheese on the pizza were absolutely delicious!!! The dough was amazing was amazing as well. The crust was slightly burned on the marguerita though. But none the less it the dough was really good. The sauce on the pasta was delicious as well. I highly suggest this restaurant!!! Also the lotus chips tasted like a combo of potato chips and sweet potato chips. Our kids loved them.  They also have a vegan menu and GF menu as well!! I'll be coming back when I'm in Oceanside again. There's also plenty of free neighborhood parking as well!!< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None</Response>< gmapID>

Glad we got to try out Blade 1936 while we were in town this fall. First, I love the name and history behind this restaurant. My degree was in journalism and minor in history. Put me inside a building that used to house an old print newsroom and I'm in heaven! We showed up on a Friday night and were told it would be over an hour wait. Would have loved to have made a reservation, but when I called I was told they don't take reservations for parties less than six. (Looks like that may be changing soon. I saw an OpenTable plug-in on their site this morning.) Luckily two spots opened up at the bar and we grabbed them quickly. We ordered WAY too much. We just wanted to try a lot of the the food since we were only going to be in Oceanside another few days. I had the red sangria and Greg had the ginger margarita for cocktails. Both delicious. We ordered a bottle of the house cab with dinner. Totally worth it! Only $20 and a solid red. For apps we did the cauliflower/green beans and bison meatballs. They were both excellent. Great texture and flavor. For entrees we got the gnocchi funghi and seafood spaghetti. The gnocchi was a bit mushy and spaghetti seemed a tad firm. Both still had good flavor, though, and portions were perfect. We also ordered a margharita pizza to split (because you have to when at an Italian restaurant, right?!) and it did not disappoint! (UPDATE: I reheated my pizza on stovetop the following day and it was equally satisfying.) We were way too full for dessert, so ended our night there. I can't wait to try out this place again when we are back in a few months.</Text>

It was an easy and obvious choice after visiting other dealerships. Garrett was an awesome sale person that catered to anything i asked. He brought me a Red Bull at my request which I later found out he payed for. All around exceptional service. Thank You Garrett and Hyundai!</Review>

Service advisor Kevin V. has usually been the one to take care of my appointments and has always been great to interact with. Even with a prepaid service package, making appointments online is easy and communication from their service dept. has been top notch when my vehicle is ready for pickup or if anything comes up. My vehicle has always been returned to me in the same cosmetic condition than I brought it in. I'll definitely be brining my car back here, their service dept. has proven very trustworthy to me; I've never felt pressured or unsure of their work.<//review>< Pics>

My first two visits were poor however this was due to the contact person and not a reflection on All Star Hyundai. When I returned to request a test drive I feel I was provided with stellar service and in particular with Rezaul Bashar. I can truthfully say, purchasing a vehicle was efficient and fun. Also, the processes between test drive, feature selections, special incentives, and finance went very well. I feel like my time was respected as well as my stated budget cap. I highly recommend asking for Rezaul if you are considering purchasing a Hyundai. He knows his product well and above all else, he is kind and personable.
I purchased a Kona limited and am extremely happy with it. It is the perfect car for me in every way.
Thank you ReZaul and All Star staff.
Best Regards, Judith</Review>

At first they couldn't find my service contract. The service manager was supposed to call me back but never did. Their on-line service appointments don't allow for pre-paid service appointments, only paid service that later they acknowledge has been prepaid. As a result, it took several calls to get the first appointment scheduled. (Now that we are in their system we believe it will be easier.) There is no waiting area during COVID (a wise choice) but no transportation service offered either, so you have to arrange for transportation elsewhere during service on your own. The car was serviced as agreed and even a little faster than expected, but returned as-is with no post-service cleaning (a little disappointing). We look forward to a little better experience during future appointments.< /Review>

Rezaul was literally the most quick and efficient car salesmen that I've ever had to deal with. It was an amazing and FUN experience! Never will you ever hear about having a real enjoyable memory at a car dealership but he did just that! I would definitely recommend Rezaul and his services! Class act and an amazing person, ESPECIALLY since he even checks up on me till this day! Thank you again, Rezaul!< /review>

We just bought a Kona Electric and are very happy with our experience at All Star Hyundai, and with Rezaul Bashar (our salesperson) in particular. Since the Kona Electric is a hard car to find right now, we had contacted five dealers; Rezaul’s conduct was far above our experience with the sales staff at the other dealers. He was courteous, honest, listened carefully to our needs, quoted us a firm price for a specific vehicle (via email - important during COVID) after 30 minutes research, and walked us through all the car’s features clearly. In addition, Rezaul gave us excellent advice on financing, purchase, and lease-to-purchase, all while avoiding any hard sell.

To put this in perspective, the salesperson at San Leandro Hyundai was friendly but insisted that an in-stock model was actually $3,000 more than the price listed on their website (and I do mean a listing with a specific VIN, not just a general “we have one some in stock at price X”).

The salesperson at Dublin Hyundai literally hung up on me when I asked for a firm price quote via email.  We live in Richmond - but the 33 mile drive to All Star Hyundai in Pittsburg was well worth it, thanks to Rezaul.</text>

Update as of 2/10/2021;
This Dealer has gone from ok, to really BAD, I am a returning customer that has purchased 2 vehicles few years ago, well, I tried to convert a Lease end into a Purchase on 2/7/2021. what a JOKE! this people are BIG Time Scammers now. they seriously don't know what they are doing there, all are into selling you a new, and not helping you with the LEASE they sold you in the first place.  After over 3 hrs waiting (and to make things worse, I was the ONLY Customer on that morning, so they were not busy), they tried to oversell/charge on GAP, and Extended Warranty, charge unnecessary DMV fees (even as the registration in current and just paid a day before and trying to sell me a bad LOAN of 6.9% (because is a USED Vehicle) or so they said, keep in mind that our credit scores are 750 & 784.

I decided to leave and try on a different HYUNDAI dealer I had also bought a vehicle before, and wow what a difference. I got a loan 3.5%, zero down, only paid $30 DMV fee, no GAP and didn't try to oversell the extended, as my current Hyundai Mfg. Warranty still valid for 2 more years or 41,000 miles on the bumper to bumper, and still have 7 years or 81,000 miles left on the Power train warranty that is 10/100,000 as my car only have 18,000 miles. And no to mention that I was there just a bit over 1 hr total.

I will NEVER, EVER go back to this SCAMMERS!< /Review>

Rezaul - thank you for taking the time for explaining in details my recent Sonata Hybrid purchase; it's the courteous services people like you provide that I continue to lease or purchase Hyundai brand from All Star Hyundai; recent purchase is the 8th vehicle (leasing/purchase) from All Star Hyundai since 2012. Keep up the good work especially during this hard times.<//review>

<rate>1</rate><review>My in-person was much worse than the communication via text. My only complaint with the texting was that the salesperson (Ted) was very slow and unresponsive. My husband contact Razul and they were able to communicate more effectively.
We had a check from our credit union and mentioned this to Razul several times. He said that it was fine and to come in. We live an hour away, and didn’t want to load the kids up waste 1-2 hours at the dealership and drive back an hour for nothing. We stressed this. Razul assured everything was fine.
We arrive and meet with Razul. He tells us that he thought my name was made up and so he googled me to find out more. Then proceeds to tell us that after reading about us, he knew we’d come. (I don’t know what that even meant). We take the car of choice for a test drive. He keeps asking us, as the car had no gas, if we were going to purchase. If so, he would put gas in the car. We told him we were interested. He then says “I’m going to run your credit so you can get financed through us.” No, we have a check and intend to purchase with that. He is still like well I have to run your credit even if you’re paying with cash. We get to the office, go over the paperwork, hand him the check... he says “oh, we can’t take that.” Excuse me?!?! He was like yeah we don’t take those. I said we specifically spoke to you about this and you said it was fine. He reluctantly gets up and finally goes to “talk” to the finance department. He says, you can take this contract go to the bank and get a check written out to us and bring it back. No! The bank is an hour further from where we were and then another hour to get back, then another hour to get home. I don’t think so! I informed him that all he needed to do was read the instructions and call the bank and they will confirm payment. He told me to call. I got up and left. He kept asking me to take the contract “in case I wanted to go to the bank.”
I was throughly disappointed and disgusted with them. They had one other customer in the whole place and she changed the car she had come in for because they lied to her. After I left, I called Infiniti (mind you I came there for a Hyundai) spoke to Tyler and the next morning the car was delivered to our house and paperwork took 20 minutes! No fuss, no muss, no lying and scheming! I would not recommend this dealership  I know they say whatever to get you in, but is it worth it if you still aren’t going to get the sale!<//review>< Pics>

All Star Hyundai provide quality and professionalism in its service department. There service representatives, especially Kevin, are knowledgeable, courteous and extremely straight forward with the service they can provide. If I have any mechanical problems with my 2013 Veloster Turbo, I do not hesitate to take it to All Star Hyundai, where you can get your car fix with a smile.

Thank you Kevin< /Text>

Found 2 cars online, came in just to see them, in no way thinking of driving away with something. (Had been dealing with multiple car places and online for a month) But I did! Unlike my previous experience, the sales person Garrett listened to what I wanted, let me state my terms, worked with realistic options I wanted to go with, then took that and worked it out with his manager. He never once tried to push me into anything and didn't feel intimidated or felt like being sold on something I didn't want. While waiting for approval, he kept it fun by chatting about work and life. He was beyond kind, and efficient.
The finance guy Rezaul was very clear, extremely organized, and straightforward. My last dealership experience, I had walked out at this phase because of overcharges I didn't want or were too costly. Rezaul made sure any changes were worked in for better rates for me and didn't effect what I had previously discussed with Garrett. He even guessed which dealership I had walked out on after hearing their shady business practice! He gave me a fist bump for standing up for myself and walking out.
I drove off with the car I wanted under the realistic terms I wanted. I didn't think I could feel so comfortable or respected at a dealership, but Garrett and Rezaul's kindness, efficiency, and charisma made it possible and am not surprised are great at what they do.<//text>

No high pressure sales techniques or any BS. The dealership is also very nice and clean inside which is great considering the current Covid situation.

He was extremely helpful in making sure I knew about all the features of the new car. I highly recommend Rezaul Barshar of All Star Hyundai. Love my new Palisade!< /Text>

One star for sales and five stars for service.

When we bought our new Tucson, the sales department told me on the phone they had the car we were looking for and when we drove over, they had lied to us.  I guess they figured that if we drove over, we would forget we asked about a specific car and would buy whatever they had..........

Fast forward to this week.

The service department is 5 stars all the way.  We drove over from Vacaville, they honored our appointment and did what they said they would do.  After the arrogance and disrespect exhibited by our Hyundai service department here in Vacaville, I'm glad we made the driver over to All Star for service.

Highly recommend.< /Review>

5 stars for my service advisor Kevin. He was extremely helpful both times I brought my car in for service. Did a good job at reaching out to me, notified me of what I needed to know with my car, no bs, straight forward. Im coming from Concord, but after a terrible experience at Future Hyundai in Concord, I’m very glad I gave All Star Hyundai a chance, they definitely made up for the bad experience I had at Future. Keep it up all Star Hyundai and thank you 👍<//Text>

Somebody really did listen at All star. The last time I had service, it took Me almost 30 min to get checked out as there was only one person to handle the job and He was at lunch. This time He wasn't there to check Me out either but They made sure that someone had My paper work and was ready to check Me out. GREAT JOB AND KEEP IT UP.<//Text>

All the staff at this location are awesome ( especially David, Kevin, Natalia and Shannon).  They treat me well-like royalty.  They’re always professional, courteous, respectful, attentive to the needs/concerns of their customers.  They are soooooooo much better than the staff that used to be at the old location on Auto Center Rd.  I Love this Hyundai location.  Could not ask for anything better- they raised/set the bar!!!<//review>

<review>I had my first-year complementary service for my 2019 Hyundai Tucson, which involved oil change, tire rotation, and multiple inspection.  The service manager was very kind and efficient.  The service was finished in about an hour.  Although I will not come back to this dealership for service because I live at the distance of one and a haf hour driving, I highly recommend this dealership to other people.<//review>< pics>

<Text>My Ford Fusion broke down after nine years of owning it. I wanted a similar high fuel efficiency car but much more reliable. Ted and Razual were great to work with. They let me test drive as much as I wanted. They gave me a good run down of the specs and how the Ioniq compares to it's competitors. For example, the Hyundai Ioniq has a 100,000 miles/10 year warranty. They were reasonable to negotiate with and were able to work out some of the pricing around the after market leather dealer. They were also super responsive and gave great detailed run through of the car stats. If you're looking for a car I would recommend this dealership.</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None< /resp>< gmapID>

I had to drive almost one and half hour together there, however, it was totally worth it. I was looking for a new car and was connected to Rezaul Bashar. He was fantastic, we communicated by text and email, finalized the dear. Rezaul honored what he promised and took care of us and there was absolutely no pressure to purchase additional add ons. The sales manager, Sam, was also great and cooperative. If you are looking for a new Hyundai, Rezaul is the person you want to work with.< /Review>

< Review>
My cousin doesn't speak any English. I took him to purchase a Certified Pre-Owned
2018 Hyundai Santa Fe last November at All Star Hyundai. The car ran great for a year, but about 2 weeks ago, the car had a very bizarre, surreal,  somewhat scary instance. According to my cousin, 'all of a sudden, the engine started to revolve at an unusual HIGH speed, and the 1,000xRPM indicator jumped from less than 2 to around 7 right away, and it was
making crazy loud noise and scary sound.' I explained the scenario as I was told to my advisor Kevin Velazquez  and mechanic Michael Mickelson. It was highly difficult to diagnose such an electrical phenomenon and perform the necessary repairs. It was really a daunting task. But after 4 days working on the car, they were able to digging down to the root cause and fixed the problem above and beyond expectations. Furthermore, they honored their CPO warranty to the fullest extent. My cousin didn't spend a dime; he is very please and satisfy with the repair.
I think they deserve nothing but 5 stars.</Review>

I just purchased my new car from Rezaul @ All Star Hyundai and it was such a seamless experience with great communication.  I would highly recommend the dealership.
I test-drove a Hyundai Palisade in June when they launched and decided to purchase one, but the dealer in San Jose refused to order one or do more than "call me if they found something similar" which I knew wouldn't happen any time soon on a newly launched car.  I had to call around to 6 dealers to find someone who would order and work with me, and that was Rezaul @ All Star Hyundai.  We agreed on the price and details, and kicked off our epic nearly 6 month adventure to get me exactly what I wanted! Rezaul stayed in contact with me, was friendly and patient, and got me exactly what I wanted!  I couldn't be more happy with my new baby ha! The dealership is clean, I was given plenty of time to drive the vehicle before buying, and unlike some dealerships with a prescribed route that they won't let you deviate from, All Star let me choose my route and the conditions I wanted to test.  All around a great experience and I would shop here again.<//Review>

On 2/1/2018 I went to All Star Hyundai to purchase a used or new Hyundai. I was driving a Hyundai and it had been a good vehicle. No problems mechanically and no re-calls. Sam Bogut came out almost immediately asking what I was looking for and went about finding my car!
He was extremely helpful with information and since this was a new experience for me took time to show me what I wanted and  I made the purchase then and there. Having never driven the "newer" cars ( my old car was a 2004 model) he took the time to show me all the things I needed to know about the car. Sam was extremely patient and helpful. The whole experience including the paperwork went smoothly. Just a pleasant experience overall.<//Review>

<review>I recently purchased a 2019 Santa Fe from these gentlemen.  This was one of the easiest, speedy and friendly car purchases I have ever made.  I was with my wife and 1 year old baby so time was of the essence.  Within 1 hour I had the contract signed and was driving home.  Sal and Rezaul are the associates who helped me and I really appreciated the lack of BS and their straight forward style.  Sal even brought my daughter a balloon when she started getting fussy.  I will definitely be back for any future purchases.</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>{'time': 1547060996574, 'text': 'Thank you for your time to write a us a review.

My wife and I were extremely impressed with our experience at All Star Hyundai. We were looking for something that we could manage in our budget and boy they delivered. Our sales person Rezaul was outstanding and understood our needs and didn't pressure us into something without our request. We are leasing a vehicle but will consider a purchase down the line for us or definitely recommend to family and friends.<//review>

Rezaul sold me a car at the exact price he quoted. No hassle, no drama, no lies and no headache. It was a good transaction and one of the best car buying experiences I've ever had. Will buy again when required.</Review>

Eric and Robert were absolutely fantastic to work with.  Robert went far and beyond to get the car I wanted from a neighboring dealer, and Eric was a delight in working with regarding my financing options.  Their goal was to make and keep me happy until they handed me my keys.  They succeeded and I love my Sonata Limited 2.0T.</Review>

<rating>4</rating><Review>The sales team there are decent folks, I have bought two cars from them and they have always given me a fare deal out the door. The  service area not always giving the customer care I would expect. I have been to see them 5 times since buying my first car with them and all 5 have been with the first car, the other car is new, not even had a oil change yet. The first time was free oil change,  that went well, second time was about two weeks after for a slow leek in a tire, not only did they tell me they wouldn't fix for free ( when I buy brand new tires at American Tire Co, they fix their tires FREE, and buying a new car from Hyundai, I would expect the same) but they told me they couldn't fix it that same day, so I took it some where else. I was pretty much done with them after that, but when we bought the second car from Hyundai, I had another slow leek in the first car, and the dealership folks told me they would have it fixed, only to find out that Hyundai puts very CHEAP tires on their cars. At this time my first car only had 24000 miles on the tires and service refused to fix this time, stating that the tread was under regulations for them to touch. Put some green fix a flat and they are still rolling at 26500 now. At this point I was never planning to pay them a visit again, but a electrcal part that was covered under the 5 year inside warranty was showing a problem, so I took it in. They ordered the part, scheduled it for the next day and had it fixed, now that is not what turned my thinking around about them, but right after I picked my car up, I went to get the upholstery cleaned and after that I started my drive home when a red light came on. Thinking service just changed a part, they must of not connected something correctly. I drove straight back to them, after we talked about everything, they came to the conclusion that the people that cleaned my seats used way to much water, and slightly shorted the sensor for the seat air bags. Now since it was not any fault of their service department, they could of charged me for taking it back to the mechanics and putting it on the scanner determining the trouble and resetting the sensor, but they didn't and that is what has me rethinking my feelings towards them. A special thanks to Rolando Vaquerano, great customer care in showing that your customers matter ***** 5 Stars.
P.S. people with cloth seats make sure the people who clean your seats, know what they are doing and are aware of the sensors in the seat if you have seat airbags.</Review>< Pics>

<review>The sales man at All star Hyundai was great.  The talking with the middle man went very slow as well as the finance guy.  It was a cash deal.  It should not have taken almost 6 hours.  We had two senior citizens with us and was really slow moving after I had made the decision on the vehicle that I wanted.  It needed to be detailed and it also took awhile.  Everything else was smooth.  I would still recommend All Star Hyundai.< /review>< pictures>

I had been in touch with Rezaul through email and text about a used Hyundai.  He was charming and helpful and I decided it was worth the hour's drive to deal with him rather than our local dealer.  When we arrived that particular car had been sold, but rather than trying to up-sell me, Sam found us the same model and year for $500 less!  Wow!  Sam and Rezaul were lovely to work with and they really wanted to make sure we drove out of there happy.  We did.</review>

I could not be more disappointed.  After an initial good experience, I was sold a vehicle that does not have the features that the Sal, my salesman said the vehicle had.  I confirmed the feature need on the phone call, my test drive, and on the day of sale.  After completing the sale, and driving away, I learned later that day that the feature was not present.  Now the salesman will not return my calls, and the sales manager says that he denies having any of those conversations.  Not only was a this ultimately a very bad buying experience, I am very disappointed and dismayed at the post-sale support, and ultimate behavior by the team.

I hope that they will engage with me, and correct this issue -- I would LOVE to make this a turnaround story, and a victory, rather than a customer leaving sadly and frustrated.  If not, then I hope this serves as a warning to others.</text>

I've posted this review elsewhere but I think it is worth putting it here as well.

I recently moved to the area from Tennessee and decided after driving across the country in an old Toyota that it was time for an upgrade. I didn't know anything about the area and decided to go here because they were closest.

After a misunderstanding that I posted here earlier, Tony Diamond, the second in command of the dealership, personally took the time to call me and make sure that things were straightened out. He also gave me the names of a few other managers there who would be able to help me one-on-one in the event of his absence. All this resulted in me going in later that afternoon to purchase the car I had had my eye on. If you get the chance, Sydney was a pleasure to work with and saw to on his own volition it that my car was filled up with gas before I left the lot. Solomon was another salesman I wouldn't hesitate to recommend. He really got into the whole experience and made it fun.

I do want to say that I appreciate the lengths that the management was willing to personally take to do business and ensure all parties were satisfied, myself included. Minus the initial hiccup, everything went smoothly.</Text>

Walid did a good job as far as being a salesman, he got us into a nicer car than we expected to get for a fair price. The reason for the two star review is because we were promised that they (walid, don) would cancel our extended warranty and gap insurance on our trade in and the check we received from that would pretty much cover our down payment. Well that check never came. We checked in with the dealership and our bank more than a few times but after we submitted our survey the dealership didn’t really care about our issues anymore. The dealership was dishonest with us and it’s upsetting as we were expecting a pretty good sized check.<//text>

I  normally don't write about my experiences (good or bad) but in these case, I must.  I have purchased and/or leased several cars in my lifetime but I have never worked with a sales associate like Rezaul.  I brought my sister along with me and we both agreed he was as knowledgeable, friendly and he had a lot patience.  They worked me with and I was able to drive off with a new 2019 Hyundai Elantra.  Rezaul, thank you for all that you did!  Sandra< /text>

This place had a variety of different cars. My favorite was the Genesis G80 luxury sedan. I have a 2015 sonata limited.  I really like it alot. Has a little kick to it for a four cylinder.< /review>

<review>Was looking for a new car and was connected to Rezaul Bashar.  He was fantastic, we communicated by text, finalized the deal and I was able to just walk in to the dealership and sign the paperwork.  It was all very easy and Rezaul took care of us and there was absolutely no pressure to purchase additional add ons.  The finance department was also great and got us in and out of there quickly.  If you are looking for a new Hyundai Rezaul is the person you want to work with.<//review>< Pictures>

Best purchasing experience ever!  We worked with Ed and Benny, received a great deal and it was one of the fastest purchases/loan signings I have ever experienced.  I would recommend this dealership to anyone interested in a Hyundai.  We purchased the Elantra GT and I love driving it.</Review>

Be careful if you come from far away. Was promised a low price on an Elantra GT 2018 that they had for sale, and was told it was there. When arrived, I was greeted and shown the model with the style and tech packages (the one I was not looking to get) and was being upsold on it (Over $100 of my monthly budget that I was asking for! Ridiculous.)

Then, after the failed attempts of upselling me, I was told that they got the car stolen a few days ago. What was more upsetting is that the salesperson said he knew about it!! Made me drive an hour away knowing the car I wanted was not available and THEN tries to sell me on something way outside of my budget even though he told me the price I was looking for was possible. Tells me that it was "heartbreaking" as I was walking away from his "deal" on the higher trim one. What was heartbreaking is lying to someone about the availability and price of the car only to try and sell them something they don't need.

tldr; dont trust this dealership if you are coming from far away, they will reel you in and lie to you.

edit: The 2018 Elantra GT is STILL on the website.<//Text>

<review>My Wife and I had a great experience at this dealership.
Rezaul was so helpful professional and kind, he made the buying experience easy and didn't pressure us as well as working hard to keep us happy and within our budget.
I would recommend anyone that wants to buy a car to check out the internet sales person Rezaul he is very knowledgeable professional and will go the extra mile for you!

Thank you Rezaul and Pittsburg Hyundai!

Exceptional and GREAT service. They will accommodate you with the car of your desire. Go see the team of Manager Kevin J. Sr. is on point, and will definitely make it happen for you to drive off in a brand new car! I got pre-approved over the phone, flew in to the dealership, simply gave them the documents they requested for me to bring in, and within a couple of hours, drove home in my lovely NEW Turbo Veloster! Go check them out! I have bought many a new cars, too much hustle...but this was the best car buying experience I've ever had!</Review>

The service department at the old location was horrible. We once had to take our car back 15 times over the course of 3 months to get an issue fixed and each time they returned our car they had broke something else. We reluctantly tried the new Hyundai dealer and were pleasantly surprised by the maintenance group. I look forward to taking my car here again.< /Review>

< Review>
I hate going to a car dealership to buy a car. But my experience with All Star Hyundai and especially with Rezaul Bashar has stood out as one of my best experience so far. Rezaul was extremely courteous, professional, knowledgeable, and a thorough gentleman. Having been to more than 3 dealerships already, I told Rezaul my budget and did not have to bargain at all as he came with the best price within my budget the very first time. No multiple trips to the “Manager’s office” to “see what I can do”. Felt respected the whole time (my previous experience with another dealership was totally the opposite). Transparency throughout the deal and was in and out of the dealership with the car within 3 hours! Definitely 5 stars to both All Star Hyundai and Rezaul.< /Review>

But because their internet manager, Rezaul, replied to me in 5 minutes with his best price, I totally took a ride and got the deal I was promised.  Rezaul set me up to buy a new Hyundai and Don the finance manager got me signed off in 15 minutes.  Don was very friendly.  Rezaul was awesome...he got the 2018 Elantra SE detailed and sat with me in the car to show me the safety features and the operational details.  Thanks Rezaul, Don, and All-Star Hyundai.</review>< Pictures>

Fred at Antioch Hyundai was a great sales person. They did not hassle me to buy I felt as thou I could easily turn away at any time. But I didn't. Fred went way out of his way-the detailers were already gone for the day, fred personally washed & cleaned up my new purchase. Stop by & see fred or wilot</text>

< review>
If you are in the market for a Hyundai vehicle, STAY AWAY from the ALL-STAR HYUNDAI dealership and the All Star Ford in the city of Pittsburgh, CA. Yes, we all have at some point run into dishonest dealerships and their management, but this once dealership takes the cake.  Before I continue, I want to establish a uniform language vocabulary that I hope will prove useful to you and anyone else on a quest to buy the ideal car.

Out the door pricing (this is the price that includes, the cost of the car, tax, DMV registration, doc fees and even the kitchen sink). MSRP: is the manufacturer suggested a price for the vehicle (which you are no encouraged to pay – unless you have a lot of money, in which case, get yourself a better vehicle, lol).

Stay AWAY from this dealership and other dealerships owned and operated by ALLSTAR. Here are the reasons why: (heed my warning)

The owner of the Hyundai dealership owns at least two dealerships in Pittsburg (All-Star Ford and All-Star Hyundai). The owner knows about the dishonest and fraudulent practices their GM engages in, and he is doing nothing about it. Why do I say that or make such claims? My experience and conversation with the car dealership employees. If this isn’t good enough to express credibility, I hold high ethical standards. Otherwise, I would not do the work that I do at a government agency. And much like you, if you are in the market for a vehicle, some expectations need to be met, such as, respect, and integrity; all of which, the GM did not exhibit. I work for the Branch, and as such, I value my time, just like you. Much like a fish on a hook, hooked by a deal we, the dealer’s internet director and sales, worked on. To ensure there were no surprises at the dealership, I confirmed and reconfirmed the terms fo the agreement. I took off to the dealership from Sacramento (Uber from Sacramento to the Amtrak Station at Sacramento, take Amtrak to Martinez and on to their dealership).

Onsite, the dealership broke the agreement and blamed another person for “bad communication.”  Don’t be scammed by this dealership. They broke the written agreement; if they can get away doing this to me, THEY will do the same to you.
Fool me once, shame on you—I am sure you heard this before. If you fall for the dealer’s selling practices; it's on YOU for not heeding my WARNING.  Yup. The buck STOPS somewhere, and it will be the GM and as a consequence, the dealer, and owner. You won’t fool me or anyone again.

To the OWNER: We had a verbal and in writing an agreement with the internet sales director. The GM is a fraudster. He SHOULD be FIRED.

He tried to not only scam me of the agreed-upon price for the car; he also refused to honor a Hyundai “boost-up” credit of $500. (I am not stopping with this review, NO, Hyundai Corp will hear from me).

Stay away from this dealership. The dysfunctionality that exists between the GM, Director of sales, the prowling of the finance people, think of vultures…yup, vultures, they are ready to dine at your expense. Don’t think this holds true?  Stay tuned; the dealership ran my credit check and I will be disputing this action as fraudulent. I will also be filing paperwork to sue both the GM, Finance manager and the owner.  Breach of a verbal contract and based on written documentation (voicemail recordings, text, email), and for other costs as they relate to my time, travel expenses. For me, it is not about the money; it is about the principle. As a government employee who holds high ethical standards and has trained officers to do the same, these vultures will come down one way or another.  Stay AWAY from this place and shop elsewhere.</review>

If you are looking for a great car buying experience go see Rezaul Bashar at  All Star Hyundai in Pittsburg!! We just purchased our 2nd Hyundai Tucson and we are loving it! I bought my first Hyundai Tucson back in 2006 in Concord and it was such a great reliable car. At 215000 miles we decided it was time to buy another car and I knew I wanted another Hyundai! Rezaul is not your typical sales guy! He doesn't pressure you. He is honest and will work hard to make sure you will get the car, price, financing, and monthly payments you want! He made our experience so smooth and made sure we were happy and satisfied!  He explained everything to us and was fun to talk to! I also want to thank Sam Bogut for helping me get the ball rolling and being so courteous. I have also had a great experience with Mike in Service! Overall a great experience and I most definitely recommend All Star Hyundai!</text>

Rezaul Bashar is the best.  He is a great Internet Salesman and he is our go to salesman.  His service was so good, we purchased two cars from him.

Go to All Star Hyundai and ask for Rezaul Bashar.  You will not be disappointed.<//Review>

I was looking for a  Hyundai Tucson in a color that was really difficult to find. Rezaul Bashar at All Star Hyundai in Pittsburg went to extraordinary lengths to find me the car that I wanted. He was a pleasure to work with, informed me about the different features of my car, and said that I can call him at any time for questions that I may have. I'd recommend him hands down.< /text>

< review>
5/25/2019 - This is my second review for this wonderful place. I have to say that most dealerships I have worked with I have been disrespected and ripped off. However this place does not harass you until you buy, but on the contrary they provide you with a wonderful service and much kindness. Just like the last time I came to purchased a vehicle, our vehicle had been a total loss due to an accident. I tried many dealerships before because people always tell you that the farther you are from home the better the price they provide you with. However that was not the case I finally decided to look back at this place and I m glad I did. I got a call from Samuel Bogut and he asked if I wanted to come check out the vehicles, this was on Thursday, I explained that my toddler was starting to fall asleep and he was very understanding and told me to let him know when she woke up and he would have the cars ready to show. When I came there was no pressure to buy or test drive, he understood that I needed time to talk to my husband and that my husband would be tired when he got home from work. The next day I reached out to ask him about the prices to clarify since I couldn’t remember well, he took it a step farther and review their weekend sales which come out on Friday and made sure I got a fair and lower price. I must say that this has been by far the best car buying experience I have ever had. Samuel I truly Thank you for making this the easiest car buying experience ever. You were nice, courteous and understanding. I was not haggled, bothered or harassed and definitely did not feel like throwing up as I have always felt after I purchased a vehicle. Thank you! I had so much fun with this purchase I still can’t believe I’m done! Our car accident was such a traumatic experience that being able to have some sense of normalcy is great. Not only did you help me get a great price, but then you even helped me return the car renta. I had a great time, it felt like hanging out with a friend. Greg from finance made things so much easier and fast since I had my children with me, he was understanding with my little one, because he understood she was tired. Also he gifted my children with candy which they are still enjoying. Thank you All Star Hyundai for making sure your costumers are taken care of.
3/16/2018 - I loved the service that my family and I received at Pittsburg Hyundai. They provided us with excellent service from the beginning and did not harassed us into buying a car. Dustin provided us with a low price from the beginning and the staff at the dealership is very attentive. On the first day I went in it was raining on my way out so Waheed, one of the salesman, stopped me before I exited the building and walked me all the way to my car holding the umbrella for me. The day I came to buy the car it was almost closing time and the Owner, Dustin and the finance staff stayed so that I could purchase the car.</review>

<text>Three words people….GO SEE REZAUL!!

So this is my 2nd beautiful Hyundai that I’ve bought from Hyundai in Pittsburg – and more specifically Rezaul Bashar. Now I am bias, and so I wouldn’t want to work with ANYONE other than Rezaul…and when you meet him you’ll understand why.  He is fun, really funny, completely down to earth, very knowledgeable and puts no pressure on you what-so-ever…making the car buying process as easy as they come. When you can find exceptional and genuine customer service in the car dealership industry, stick with it. To me this is Rezaul in a nutshell. My first purchase was a beautiful 2017 Hyundai Elantra Limited and that transaction was just beyond smooth from A-Z. I loved every part of it – from the test driving, to finding out I had a spare tire, to signing.  Now, I am the proud owner of a 2018 Hyundai Sonata Limited which I also absolutely adore. This car is the car for me! I couldn’t be happier with my recent purchase!  Rezaul not only made the test driving enjoyable but also the process of elimination was pretty fun too- while Mike in finance made the financial aspect of this purchase really simple to understand and thus easy – both parts of this transaction went off without a hitch . Of course I am grateful and appreciative since it can be really stressful when it comes to buying a car.  This is my 4th Hyundai that I’ve owned and at this rate it may be the only car brand I go with because it’s the one I trust.  Thanks again to Rezaul and Mike for everything!!< /text></record>

Five stars is not a high enough rating for his dealership or Rezaul Bashar, the internet manager at All Star Hyundai. Rezaul made the whole experience fun and very easy. We went to get one new vehicle and left with a second one for our daughter as well. I would recommend this dealership and Rezaul to everyone.</text>

I researched the new Hyundai Ioniq Hybrid model, Honda Accord Hybrid, Chrysler Volt, and Ford Fusion Hybrid and ended up getting Sonata Hybrid plug-in instead. Perhaps that change of heart had something to do with my fond memories of my old reliable Sonata. This car served me so well for 15 years without breaking down...not even once. Truly amazing! Yet I suspect the main driver were my interaction with the Hyundai staff like Michael at the Service Dept.,   and Rezaul Bashar. Rezaul, competent, friendly, and professional clinched the  deal for me. I signed! Would I buy another car from this guy? Certainly! Would I recommend this dealership to my friends? In a heart beat!

Rezaul, the agent who helped me was very knowledgeable and knew a lot about cars. He explained each and every detail of the car and knows what he is talking about. He took care of all the steps in the car buying process and made the process quite easy. He is a wonderful guy to work with.

<Review>i had purchased a santa fe when they were at the other lot in antioch. since the move to pittsburgh the sales department has not been good. i went back recently about purchasing another vehicle. i was approached by a gentleman who did not introduce himself and immediately started asking how much down do i have and what is my credit score. when i said i will not disclose my credit score he passed me over to another sales rep then the same guy asked the questions again then laughed and walked away. The finance department was no help either. A gentleman in that department told me what hyundai finance would not approve me but yet my credit was not checked. it was a humiliating experience and not once but twice it has happened. the service department was only the stress free experience i had there. but i will not be returning to this dealership for anything</Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

Went to purchase a 2015 genesis coupe for ~$19000, and it turned out it was at the other lot around the corner. ( About a 5 mins drive). One of the guys went to pick it up & took 45mins to come back after I threatened to leave because it was taking so long. I had test drove a 2018 GT hatchback for about $18,000 while I was waiting because that was another car of interest. One of the sales guys told me I was a "good driver for a woman." He also kept trying to con me into getting another car because he was trying to convince me that the Genesis coupe had "too much power" for a woman. After waiting 45mins and test driving the GT to kill time they lied and said that someone had bought the Genesis coupe during that time frame even though when I first showed up they had called the manager at the other lot and said it was mine. I decided to crunch some numbers with the GT. I also came in with a letter from Hyundai finance saying I was preapproved, the sales guy told me that they got me a deal with my letter for Hyundai finance but after sitting over 2 hours he said Hyundai had declined me. They also kept trying to screw me over with the price saying that the GT was $27000 even though I had the VIN# from the website which showed $18,000. I will not be doing business here again.</Text>

<text>I recently bought a new Sonata at All Star Hyundai. My initial contact was with Rezaul Bashar in the internet sales department. We had a pleasant email exchange so I decided to do to the dealership and look at the 2017 and 2018 Sonatas. Rezaul is very friendly and informative and is very low pressure! While at the dealership, I was also greeted by the sales manager Gary Bernal. Gary was polite and welcomed me to the dealership and told me he was available if I had any questions or needed anything and it was his wish that should I decide on a Hyundai that I give All Star Hyundai an opportunity to earn my business. (This was done in a casual & pressure free way).
After several hours I went home without buying. I went to other area dealerships, Hyundai and other manufacturers and was not treated with the same respect.
Ultimately I went back to All Star and bought from Rezaul.  From my first email to driving off the lot, my experience with All Star Hyundai was top notch. If you are in the market for a Hyundai or a used car, do yourself a favor and give Rezaul Bashar an opportunity to assist you.<//text>< pictures>

< Review>
Just finished purchasing a Hyundai Santa Fe from All Star Hyundai and the overall buying experience was excellent. I am a very informed buyer and do a lot of research on the cars I buy so my typical experience when buying a car is dealing with sales people who don't know the car I want to purchase as well as me and generally seem to know less about the process of selling cars than I'd like. Thankfully the internet car salesman Rezaul Bashar was a true pro and made the whole process of buying a car at this dealership a very pleasant and relaxing experience. Every time time I asked a question he gave me a quick and accurate answer.(NO BS)  Immediate followup on E mails and phone calls. Extremely pleasant and no pressure approach to working with customers and I got the feeling the ethical bar is extremely high in his personal approach to business relationships. He also spent a lot of time showing my wife the technical aspects of the car which I rarely see at dealerships these days. If you have a wife, girlfriend or daughter who needs a trusted salesman to guide them through a car buying experience Rezaul Bashar is the guy I would recommend. I don't know this dealerships history but it appeared to me that a new team is taking over this dealership and they are trying to do things the right way for their customers. The lead sales manager thanked both my wife and I at the end of the process and had a great attitude toward customer satisfaction. Definitely a 5 star buying experience!     CW< /Review>

I've purchased my 2017 Hyundai Sonata SE at AllStar Hyundai, Pittsburg this month. My purchase process was very smooth and effortless.

Sales person Dustin was courteous, answered all my questions regarding the vehicle. Purchase price was very good, beat prices from all other Hyundai dealers in bay area that I talked to before visiting Allstar Hyundai. Financing my vehicle purchase is also very smooth, all options are explained clearly.

This is my second vehicle purchase at AllStar Hyundai, Pittsburg, CA.

I would recommend AllStar Hyundai to anyone looking to purchase a Hyundai vehicle.</text>

<username>Williamson Roasa< /username>< Review>
Recently bought Santa Fe Sport 2017 2 days ago. Sale experience is worst. Don't get help from Pete or Phil. I got the car brand new but unclean. i went back and forth for 2 days because of these salemen's promises that service department will clean and take care of it as priority but never happened. Service department also turned me down making my disappointment even totally worst giving me alibis of 1st come 1st serve appointment despite me reasoning out nicely that the car is brand new.

The ridiculous part else was NO SHUTTLE where i think it should be more available for all car dealerships on weekends where customers do all their errands and car services at the same time.

Service department manager too was telling me they can have the car get cleaned up in a so called secret car wash but outside only just because there's nothing they can found in their system as brand new car detailed cleaning order. i figured he's talking about runnning my car into an outside dealership quick carwash place. 1st thing, that's poor remedy service. 2nd why would a new car owner trust their new car to another carwash place just to get rid of the problem.

In general, the salesmen and service department have poor communication and work organization. If these people have at least took care the appointment scheduling or settled cleaning up order or any other special brand new car services for new car owners like us, problems like this will never happen. It just proves that if you need a car, you can never have a great experience with sale service. Yes it's obviously they want money or get things done the way they want but at least they can be more consumer friendly and more service oriented with special attention to new clients or buyers.

Addendum: they finally clean and wash my car but to make it quick only the exterior part of the car was just done. I can really tell interior has not been touched neither the engine compartment which is full of dust and dirt after the clean up service. I did not bother anymore to complain about this as this was very frustrating and too much on my part to keep going after them for a better overall service after all that had happened.

this is just my experience or opinion. Hope it helps you out there for your next car experience.<//Review>

<Time>1431997658315</Time><text>Thanks to A.B. Shahab, my college-graduate daughter has a new car she LOVES and we both had a great experience at the dealership (who woulda thought?) We went to another car dealership a couple days before and left with no car and lots of stress from the condescending and pushy attitude of the manager there. We were prepared for more of the same at Antioch Hyundai but instead we met A.B. Shahab who asked us the important questions about what WE wanted and left us alone when we just wanted to look for awhile. But every time we had a question, he was there - very pleasant, wanting to help and not condescending or pushy. He went the extra mile to make sure my daughter was happy with her purchase and it felt genuine, which I appreciate. Manager Kevin Johnson was also great to deal with; he treated us like equals, whereas the other dealership manager treated us like dumb women who needed to be told what to do. NOT the way to get my business. I recommend him if you are looking for a vehicle and make sure you ask for A.B. to help you through the process - he definitely made the sale for us.</text><rate>5<//rate>< GmapID>

<rating>1</rating><review>Upon making an appointment for a recall issue, I was told by Dominic in the service center that I would need to drop my car at 8am and would not have it back untill 3/4 pm for something that takes 15 minutes, 30 absolute tops. Unacceptable. I asked why the long time and was given the run around. Bad taste before I even made it through the door.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>{'time': 1497975462361, 'text': 'I am sorry to hear about your negative experience and would like to speak with you regarding this issue.

This is a good lunch place. The place was busy but they sent us to the public seating area. The food was fantastic. The cheese plate was big and flavorful. The salmon tartare was delicious and the salads were really fresh. A great place, we will definitely come back for lunch again.</review>

Last restaurant before heading back to Europe, I’ve eaten in 5 states and numerous cities this trip, and this was the best! I’ve read some reviews here and my head hurts. People know very little about goo food. Our server Dill knew very well what he was offering and how to match everything. Management came bye to check in, which is always appreciated (timing is everything). Prices are very fair considering the combinations of flavors on a single plate. Americans are too accustomed to crazy big plates that they don’t even finish (For disclosure, I’m born and raised in Chicago), then they complain when it’s “too small” even though they actually go home not feeling bloated from over-eating. This place deserved a visit from Michelin. Thank you to everyone at this amazing place for your hard work and talent. These people love what they do. Very grateful. Until next time (hopefully not very long!).<//text>

Fabulous rustic bar feel with great tapas and beer selection. An energized and spirited crowd with a classy vibe. The cheese and nut plate is fabulous as well as duck liver pate. The place definitely specializes on finger food that complements the drinks. Reasonably priced for SF standards. Will return.</Text>

Busy place. Great service. (In retrospect, upstairs dining may have been a slightly quieter option, one perhaps a bit removed from the hustle and bustle of the crowd). Beet salad was highlight of the dinner. Also tried gulf shrimp, rib eye and halibut. Rib eye was flavorful. Halibut was enjoyable.</Text>

The food quality here is very good. We ordered the seared duck breast (medium rare) and it was very tender and flavorful. The pork chop and roasted asparagus were also good, but the highlight of the night was the duck by far.

Service: 4/5
The servers were friendly but it took a while for us to get seated even though we had a reservation.

Value: 3/5
Even though the food was good, the prices were fairly high for what you're getting - as far as higher-end restaurants go, you can definitely get more out of your money from different places.</text><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None</Response><Gmap_id>0x8085806327404d45:0xe1f8b0c1a0530f14</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

The food was amazing, but the wait staff was absolutely incredible. I proposed here and the entire staff got in on it and sent us deserts and drinks to celebrate. If you have the chance sit in Talia’s section, she was totally on the ball with her recommendations. Will definitely be coming back next time we’re in town!< /review>

The drinks - why we came here for lunch - did not disappoint. I ordered off menu and the boulevardier was good. Food was also great. Shrimp salad did not disappoint. Give it a try.<//Review>

<review>This restaurant is very chic' and is made for romantic dinners, business meeting with high profile clients, and foodies alike. The ambiance was great and the noise level was typical with no one talking over each other to see who could be the loudest.

We started out with the mixed nuts which could get a little bland if it weren't for the sweetness and consistency of the sugary goodness of the honey that accompanied. Then moved on to the Alaskan cod which was magnificent and my company had the Fulton Valley chicken which has to be some of the best I've ever tasted. I would go back again in a heartbeat!<//review><pics>None<//pics><Response>None< /Response>< gmapID>

<review>The place was PACKED for lunch, which I wasn't expecting! Their lunch menu was pretty limiting, especially as a vegetarian or vegan. We all got the shrimp salad, which was tasty, just wish there was a lemon on the side as it tasted a little fishy. Service was decent, atmosphere was great, was just very loud!</review><Rating>4<//Rating>< Gmap_id>

<review>Variety of starters, we had the shishito peppers and bread served with goat fat butter for a tasty start. Thoroughly enjoyed my pork chop, lean and moist. My wife's gem salad was on the wilty side, so that wasn't a good order. Friends had bass and trout, both thoroughly enjoyed.</review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< gmapID>

I liked this place. My son ordered steak tartar. He liked but was not crazy about the Asian vibe. I on the other hand loved Asian sauce, I though it was a very interesting take on  a steak tartar. His burger was good but medium done even though he asked for medium rare. I got cheese plate as an appetizer - it was good but  not extraordinary, candied walnuts were a nice touch. My pasta with mushrooms Pappardelle however was absolutely amazing.
I have to say that is very crowded, it is hard to navigate between tables without bothering other patrons. They crammed as many tables into the space as possible without thinking about comfort.
Overall it was a nice experience, I would visit it again.<//Text>

The interior design feels hip and modern, but not annoyingly hipster or trying too hard.

The food was delicious. I had the mixed green salad and truffle fries. Both were delicious. My salad was a good size and had great ingredients like fennel and a great mix of lettuces. The fries were delicious! They came in a very nice sized portion, and were very well cooked. Enjoy!< /review><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmap_id>

The cocktail I had was great but I'm sad to report that I was very disappointed with the burger. The bun was dry and tasted like a pre-packaged bun from a supermarket. The fries were not the best either. I was there in the middle of a crazy lunch rush, so maybe it is better in the evenings. Service was friendly, despite the rush!< /text>

Good service, atmosphere and great food.  Had the seared tuna appetizer, pork loin entree and caramel cake dessert.  All were great tho the cake was dry and mostly devoid of flavor.  My BF had the chocolate dessert and his was excellent.   I know the reviews are mixed, but we would definitely return (tho I'd make a different dessert choice).<//Review>

<text>The setting is modern and trendy, and makes for a great first date restaurant. The food is good, but nothing special.  The service wasn't bad when I went.  The interior is kind of crammed. Parking here is extremely difficult and the valet is easy to miss (pull into the side street next to the restaurant). Overall, good first date restaurant that's reasonably priced and trendy.</text><pictures>None</pictures><userid>102517185249896754624</userid><gmap_id>0x8085806327404d45:0xe1f8b0c1a0530f14< /gmap_id>< rate>

True to their name, the food was a bit salty. Would pair well with drinks. Has a good ambiance with trendy decor (bare incandescents, iron pipe, raw wood), and was very busy. Good place for lunch, or burger and drinks after work. Burgers were large, enough to be 2 meals even.<//text>

<Review>Huh, I don't get it.  I've been 3 times to the Salt house and just a so-so experience.  It would get 2 stars if it weren't for it's very aesthetic decor.

The first time we went for happy hour.    DON'T order their "bar food."  It's not fit for eating with drinks...messy messy messy.  A bowl of hot nuts with honey on them?  What is that?  Good, yes.  Bar food, no.

The second time, the food was okay.  My friend ordered a grilled cheese sandwich.  We were expecting a gourmet concoction...no luck...a $15 grilled cheese.

The third time, the food was good, the wait staff nice, but nowhere near deserving of a 5-star review.  Sorry Salt House....and from the people that brought us Town Hall...</Review>< pictures>

This was a solid dinner and I would definitely go again. Most of the dishes were about $30, except for a large, 60 day aged ribeye ($67). Our waiter suggested it would be a good one to share so my wife and I went for it as our main entree.

The rest of the items we ordered were great, but our steak, which we ordered medium rare, was medium well at best. We couldn't taste anything special about it. The waiter finally came by after quite a while and asked how it was. I never send anything back but was very disappointed with the steak and brought up how overcooked it was. He immediately offered a new one and we took him up on it.

It was a bit of a wait and I felt a bit guilty since we had eaten at least half the other steak, but I'm so glad we did. The second steak was a bit on the rare side, but it was an amazing steak. I've never had a dry age steak with that much flavor (and a bit of funk at times). So, in the end it was a wonderful experience and we loved the steak.</text>

Quite simply, the cod was absolutely fantastic. The restaurant was loud, but not to the point that it was impossible to carry a conversation.

Well worth thr visit. I'll be back!</review>

The food was good, but nothing I would die for! Actually, the apple pie with ice cream was great. The building is very beautiful. The waiter was a little rude with my friend. He tryed taking something off from the table, my friend asked him politely to not doing it. Some time after, he came back asking rudely if he could remove it from the table.</text>

Staff was very friendly and helpful and service was quick. The restaurant looked like many other trendy restaurants and in general seemed nice and clean.

The restaurant was really full when visiting so it is highly recommended to make a reservation.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

Make sure you have a reservation or you might not get in, or if you do, facing a wall behind a beam or in a hidden corner somewhere.

The food is good. Great place for a nice expensive burger, or something much fancier. Definitely a good place to have someone else pay! But you will all enjoy your food.< /Review>

Fabulous food and very good service. Came here on a Saturday evening and it wasn't terribly busy. Being in the financial district perhaps the weekend is a better time to visit. The NY Steak was tender, and both the cod and sole were delicious.<//text>

This is a case where management gets in the way of a quality restaurant. The serving sizes were too small for people who have alternative diets. Vegetarian options are limited as the salads can't be considered a meal for being too small. My wife eats very little. She should never leave hungry.  The cocktails were all ice. $15 for less than 2 oz is a bad value. It took 20 minutes after water for a server to come back to check for our order. For the record, it was the HOSTESS that had to take our orders. And that was after waiting 10 minutes for the hostess to seat us. Going cheap on staff when your menu value is poor is unacceptable. We didn't see our actual server until well into the main meal.  Again, the food was fantastic. Complements to the kitchen! Everything else, however, results in a place I can't recommend.<//review></record></dataset><record>

Food was fine, service and "hospitality" were very poor. At least one unfriendly or inattentive staff member trampled over the experience.

What's worse is they were equally unfriendly at Eat Drink SF.

EDIT: very good follow up from restaurant on this, so +1 star!
Hoping to add another two in the future.<//review>

Sure, the food is fine, the staff are nice, the ambiance is good buuuuuut it's SO PRETENTIOUS. Expect to see a boatload of ingredients you don't know or can't pronounce, seemingly on there just to impress you. It's like they are adding extras to normal food just to be able to tack an additional $5 to whatever they serve. This is just my preference though - I wouldn't recommend it, but I also wouldn't decline to go there if invited by friends.< /review>

< Review>
Came here with a large group for dinner on a Saturday night. The service was a bit slow, but it was Saturday and all tables were filled.  They serve fresh Acme bread and butter, which is always a plus.  I ordered the fish, which was very light and not very flavorful. My husband got the beef duo, which was a lot tastier than the fish.  The short rib was moist and the sirloin was tender. I would definitely recommend ordering the beef duo.<//Review>

Service was good. The mushroom soup and oysters were delicious, but wasn't too impressed with the shrimp salad or poutine. However, ended on a great note with a delicious key lime dessert.</review>

<Review>Went for lunch. Reservation. Service was the best. The Refresher cocktails were excellent as were the Shishito Pepper appetizers. The Humbolt Fog cheese was great. Didn't care for the Tonkatsu Wrap, it was a clumsy execution. Wrapped poorly. The Tonkatsu was a little too greasy and the fries were a little bit heavy-handed wrt Takoyaki similarity.  But, I would still recommend the place and I plan to visit again for Cocktails and other eat treats.</Review><time>1553751741928</time><pictures>None<//pictures>< username>

<Review>The poutine is great here and a nice surprise. The cod was cooked perfectly and the caramel popcorn dessert was amazing. The staff was friendly and the drink menu had a decent selection to choose from. It can get a little loud, but it is fun watching the chefs cook all the delicious meals.< /Review>< pictures>

<date>1470250976372< /date><rate>4</rate><review>The food here is well done, and there are lot of options. The Cobb salad is one of my go-to dishes there, it's huge! It's definitely a meal salad and there is an option to add extra protein on top. The service is always top notch. The waiters will refill water regularly and check in. However, the wait is always longer than they say it will be. People tend to linger at their table after eating/paying the bill, so an estimated wait of 20 minutes will stretch out closer to 30/35 minutes, maybe even 40 minutes. It's really popular with the lunchtime crowd, so to avoid a long wait, come early, or go much later in the day.</review>< Pics>

The pork chop was by far the best of the three meals.  The fish was good, but nothing mind blowing.  They do have some good cocktails.  It was a little odd because it shares a restroom with some venue (a club?) and the music was blaring - it was a little loud in the restaurant and wild in the restroom.< /review>< Name>

Really great vibe, food, and wine. Dish was about $26, so it's pricier than the norm. I really recommend going with a small group, 4-5 people, and sitting in the loft area.</text>

<rating>4< /rating><Name>Marie G.<//Name><text>Happy hour rating for Salt House. Had the salmon tenders, and also tried their Ragin' Cajun' wings, which were far more spicey than the tenders, obviously. Not good service, but the crowd and the vibe make up for it. Fried chicken looked good at the table next to me. Our hostess made sure we got waters right away, which is always appreciated. Am not quite sure why this place is usually packed, as it doesn't seem to be special, merely solid. Probably benefits from its good location on Mission.< /text><user_id>116271674884866059202< /user_id>< Time>

Great restaurant for a nice night out with friends. Plenty of options for plates to share with friends, as well as mains for yourself. Their list of carefully crafted cocktails (plus AWESOME and knowledgeable bartenders), varietals of wine,  solid selection of beers, and non-alcoholic options ensure all members of your dining party are happily watered as they await the delicious food to come.

Appetizers/shared items:
Shishito peppers: perfectly blistered with that tasty finishing maldon salt evenly salting the peppers (even the ones on the bottom). A must-have for sharing with the table.

Sourdough batard with whipped duck fat: Can't go wrong with fresh, hot bread with a savory duck fat spread on top

Poutine: Well balanced gravy (not too salty! Yay!),  cheese, fries ratio. Glad that we chose to share this between the 5 of us, giving each of us just enough to enjoy the dish without stuffing ourselves.

Black Pepper Cavatelli: Again, great for sharing so that none of us felt guilty for filling up on pasta prior to our mains

Mains:
Duck breast: I ordered mine medium rare and it came out wonderful. Very tender and flavorful, paired very well with the vegetables (loved the turnips)  and fruit (plum).

Dessert:
Black Pepper Pound Cake: Don't wrinkle your nose at this if you're unsure about the foie gras chantilly. The depth brought out by the extra fat  and subtle flavor of the foie gras goes well with the pound cake (I appreciate that it wasn't overly sweet), contrasting with the light plum sorbet.

Matcha Cheesecake: This matcha cheesecake was DELICIOUS, but the angostura bitters sorbet was what hit this dessert out of the park.</text>

Food tasted average at best, small portions and pricey for what it was. There was a roach crawling against the wall, and no one from the restaurant came to help. The area I sat in towards the back of the restaurant also had a stale smell. Overall bad experience.<//Text>

The food was amazing. We had shishito peppers, quail eggs, a cheese plate for apps and all were great, highly recommend the shishito peppers. The main was the Niman Ranch bacon wrapped pork which was very juicy and tender. Perfect place for work outings and dates. Our server was attentive but not bothersome at all.</Text>

I've worked a block away from Salt House for the past two years and just stepped foot into it last week.  The restaurant is two levels with a bustling bar and open kitchen on the first level.  Dreamforce was going on at the time, so that may have impacted the amount of traffic but every table was full and there was a steady turnover.  Our waitress was fantastic but the service was slow getting our drinks.  I had the beet and burratta salad to start which was absolutely fantastic and the scallops entree which was equally impressive.  I finished my meal with a cup of really flavorful coffee and the seasonally appropriate pumpkin cheesecake.  We really enjoyed the food here and will definitely return.  Reservations are definitely needed!</Text>

< Review>
The four stars is definitely for the service!  My party hadn't arrived yet, and the hostess kept an eye on me until they arrived.  There were a lot of people coming in, mostly with reservations and I was afraid I wouldn't get a table because I didn't have one.  But she was so accommodating and I didn't wait long for a table.

The food was really good.  I ordered salmon with chanterelle mushrooms and fava beans.  I was hoping for a bigger portion, especially for the price, but it was nonetheless delicious.  And we ordered to desserts to share: the raspberry cream tart and the brown butter cream cheese pound cake.  The tart was had just the right amount of sweetness and tartness.  The pound cake wasn't served sliced.  They were cut into half-dollar size circles on top of whipped cream with scattered strawberries.  It was really good, and I'm glad it wasn't a bigger piece because it can tell it would be heavy.

The atmosphere was lively for a Monday night, and I like the industrial decor.  I'd like to come back and try the poutine!</Review>

I love their salmon tartare with their criss cross lightly salted chips as an appetizer. I do favor their poutine but for lunch, that's all I'd be having if I ordered that. I usually go for their sandwiches but this time I tried their seasonal watermelon salad with arugula, feta cheese topped with light jalapeno dressing. Service is also great here and it's always busy for lunch.</review>< Pics>

(Translated by Google) It costs a reasonable price, but it is very tasty. There are many menus using Japanese such as Shishito. It is located near Market Street and is well located and always crowded.

それなりの値段はしますが、とても美味しいです。Shishitoなど、日本語を使ったメニューがたくさん見受けられます。マーケットストリートの近くにあって立地がよく、いつも混んでいます。<//review>
