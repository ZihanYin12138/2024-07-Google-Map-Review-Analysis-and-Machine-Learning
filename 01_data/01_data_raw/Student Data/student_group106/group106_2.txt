Our go to pizza place. Whenever we crave pizza we always agree on Pizza Hut. Almost always get delivery instead of carryout. We usually order on the app so we get to see the process of order received, in the over, to on it's way. We like that we can either pay with credit card or cash. They also offer contactless delivery too. We love the bone in wings as well as the pastas. We usually get the pepperoni with jalapeño, Hawaiian pizza, and the supreme. The delivery person has always been very nice and the pizza has arrived sealed and still hot.<//text>

I celebrated my graduation last night in this great restaurant. Well we enjoyed a fine evening and the venue was definitely one of the reasons for the outstanding evening. The waiters  participated in a gorgeous manner, the cooking was tasty and my guests were so  cheerful. We shall definitely return for more events. thanks very much.<//Review>

I was very please with my pizza and its prompt delivery. It came sealed and very delicious with a buttery crust and prefect breadsticks. Would recommend to my friends.<//text>

Pizza Hut is always good. And there are some days where only  a pizza from Pizza Hut will do. I ordered a Supreme Personal Pan pizza to go. Just as I expected. It was De-lish. They also have delicious Fettuccini Alfredo, breadsticks and more.</Text>

This rating is for the "service fee". The cashier was super friendly, and even reminded me of something I'd forgotten but paid for. My order was correct and prompt.

I ordered online and picked up in store. When I paid I noticed a "service fee" charge. Apparently it's too expensive to run a business in southern California so instead of raising costs uniformly they charge this fee.

Will not be coming back.

Edit: In response to below, rate everything 5 percent then. Then I'll come back. Expecting to pay menu price isn't an outrageous request. Hidden fees are the issue, not the price.<//text>

<Date>1567118377703< /Date><rating>1<//rating><Text>False advertising. Charged me more at the location even though I ordered online. My price online said a lower price, but once I got to the location they said they had to charge more because I didn't order online. Even though that's how they received my order is because I placed it online. On top of it both of orders were burnt. All you can taste is the burnt flavor and when I was at the location it did smell like they were burning something. Manager offered me a 5 dollar credit which wouldn't even cover half of what I paid. Very poor customer service. I would reccomend going to a different location or save your money and get some food somewhere else.<//Text>< pictures>

Something was strange about this stuffed Crust cheese pizza which sounds like it’d be hard mess up, but the cheese had a strange texture like it was nuked in the microwave also I don’t feel good as I’m writing this review...

The delivery gal was very nice and polite though!< /review>

The service is as equal bad as the food. I've orderd from there twice, and both times I had to wait 5 mins min. before anyone would answer. like its a policy to make you wait, and seeing as I drive by there often im pretty sure it's not because there busy. Anyway long, gross, story short *don't* eat here!< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None< /Response>< GmapID>

<text>The chicken wings gave some serious food poisoning. When I complained, they said "were sorry that you had a bad experience, we hope that you will order from us again. I lost a week's pay, had to pay for urgent care and meds. Not to mention the hell I went thru. I still can't even stand to look at a chicken wing without throwing up in my mouth. Thanks pizza hut. For nothing.< /text><response>None< /response>< Pics>

<Rating>5</Rating><Text>Probably one of the most enjoyable watering holes out in the desert.  The owners give the place their all and it shows.  This place has heart and soul, and great music, cold beverages and friendly staff.  I've stopped in many time in my travels to and from the Indian Wells Valley and if you're lucky, Sophia will be working and she is the consummate mixologist; friendly, knowledgeable, attentive  without being overbearing and very easy on the eyes!
Stop in and see her and have her mix you up a handmade craft cocktail or pour you a pitcher of ice cold beer.  You'll thank me!!!</Text></record>

The food was just great. We enjoyed every moment and we shall definitely come back again. Highly recommended.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None<//Response>< gmapID>

My only disappointment was they weren't serving any food when we were there. They had no problem with us grabbing food from the burger joint next door. We will come back when in the area.<//text>< pics>

Decent body shop for what it is. They are honest and stick to their word. Easy communication, cooperative, and overall a pretty good experience. They took good care of my AP1 S2000 when I dropped it off to them and they were kind enough to wait for my parts to come in and nothing was rushed. Had a bent/damaged radiator core supporter and a structural pull was performed and they installed my performance radiator nicely. Would recommend Hughes Auto Body to the people of Santa Barbara.< /text>

I'm forever taking my car here in the future. My car got hit while parked and I took it to Hughes for an estimate. It took the people a while 2 weeks to get back to me. When we got to Hughes the people who hit my car were so rude and mean and Vanessa and the manager stepped in for me and helped me out big time. It was the best experience working with them. They're so helpful, especially Vanessa. I love them all so much</text>

Professional, accurate, friendly, high quality service!  Sometimes you need someone to fight for you when dealing with insurance companies and rental car companies.  I had been a victim of someone hitting my car.  Brought it to Hughes and they took excellent care of me.  Fought with the other parties insurance company for me so I wouldn’t be stuck without a vehicle to get to work and to pick up my kids from school.   I have been soo happy with them that it brought me to tears after all the stress and headaches I’ve had to endure from the other parties insurance and also the terrible rental car service.  Gracia, Gabby and Alex have been absolutely excellent and would recommend them to everyone!!!!   Don’t waste your time with anyone else !<//Review>

My insurance company recommended them, and now I know why. They are reasonable and quick and have some of the best customer service I've encountered - ever. The car looked brand new when it was finished, which is no small feat for a 9 year old vehicle. 6/5 stars!</review>

<Review>I just had was my second "chance" to get some work done with Hughes Auto Body. They are efficient, honest and do quality work. Walt is excellent and knows how to run his shop well. The cars came back looking just as they did before the accidents, actually even better as the Hughes staff washes them and dresses your tires for you. Great quality service. They're my go-to shop for sure.</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None</Response><GmapID>0x80e9400b32691e25:0xf0cd5cc978cf6b6a</GmapID></record>

I have had Hughes do work on 3 different cars, and I would not go anywhere else.  Their work is excellent and gets done quickly, in most cases only a couple of days.  Walt is friendly and fair, and hasd always gone the extra mile for us.

Not sure what the whole story was with J's sister, but I can't see it being worthy of a 1 star rating.  Regardless of what happened on the phone, I am sure her sister's car was expertly repaired an returned to her in great condition.

Thanks Walt for all you have done for us.<//Text>

My experience was great with Hughes auto body.  After getting in a slight accident they went above and beyond to repair my car for just the deductible.  Not only did my front bumper look better than before the accident, but the whole process was quick and painless.  They took care of everything and made sure to keep me updated on the process.  I am so glad they were recommended by the insurance company and will definitely be going back from now on.  Julie (I believe her name was) provided me with the best service any auto shop has provided.  Very hospitable and friendly.  Thanks to you all :)</review>

<review>It's always scary and worrisome after an accident. The first thing I did was to check body shops around with high reviews...I came across this one. Glad I did! They are VERY VERY nice and you feel like they are your friends:) comforting! I was somewhat patient lol, it almost took a month for my car to get fixed but it was because of my insurance:/ but I really recommend these guys!!! They are AWESOME!! YOu will be in good hands:) all the girls are nice :) my Nissan was good:)<//review>< Pics>

<text>PRO

Fast service, low price (any lower, it will be crap) and excellent work.

CON

I would like to go back there again but they had to use imitation parts to fix my car.

OVERALL

I recommend them.<//text>< rating>

Great service, efficient communication and a really easy way to get a car remote programmed with lots of help and support even better was the great deal being they had gave me a higher price quote and left with paying only half of what the quote originally  was. Thank you for the great customer service experience.<//Review>

They were fantastic. Easily saved me over $300 on my cars key fob replacement! They were fast, professional and really knew what they were doing. They've helped me out of a jam in the past and were fast and professional then as well. I'll be going back if/when I ever need lock services in the future.< /Review>

We give 100% to each and everyone of our customers. Not all situations are quickly resolved. When you called back the second time, I was ready to speak with you about your safe. I apologized to you as much as I could about the time you had to wait, but you continued to call me unprofessional and asked me how I would like to be placed on hold for that long.

We have 3 different programming units and all of them would not connect. Usually if the vehicle is in good working condition there is no issues with programming. If you paid someone $360.00 to program a remote key you already had here in town, I can assure you more work had to be done or you were extremely over charged.'}</response>

Kwik Key Service is exactly that service that was quick and reliable. I needed a second key for my vehicle cut and they were able to supply me an exact duplicate and made sure the key would fit the original door locks and the ignition. Very prompt and thorough, and polite as well. I would recommend them to anyone who could use thier services<//review>

<review>These guys are super helpful! Whatever the situation you have, if it requires a key or has a lock, they can help. They even helped me with a car key that needed to be cut and programmed when the dealership couldn't. The dealership wanted to do a full diagnostic that would have cost me a lot of money but Kwik Key figured it out for free and just charged me for the programming saving me money and keeping my car out of the dealership. I always go to them for anything lock or key related now.< /review>< pictures>

A client of the firm I work for had asked if we knew of any "real" locksmith  to help her unlock something she'd lost the key to. I had gone to Kwik Key several years ago for replacement car keys and was very pleased with their service, so I recommended them.  The client came back today and told us that Kwik Key was wonderful and to thank me for the recommendation.  She said they were very helpful and pleasant in taking care of her and that the price was very reasonable. Kwik Key did a great job and I get to bask in the reflected glory and take a little credit for helping her out, which makes MY service more valuable to our client.  So thank you, Kwik Key, for making me look good!</Text>

Went there again today and again really good service. When I checked a couple of years ago they were the only local locksmith that could copy my Chevy backup key (the one inside the wireless fob). They are way cheaper than Chevy at replacing a lost key.</review>

< Review>
Today I needed a couple of keys, One for my car and misc keys for other things.  Keys appear to be working fine.
My ONLY, and BIG concern..is that when employee had to enter my car to program THAT key, I really would have appreciated if she would have communicated to me that she would need to go in my car, ( a little warning or permission) would have made me less anxious, especially during this time of the Corona-Virus pandemic. Let's all be considerate to one another and sensitive to one another. I don't know if I could have turned the key, etc. so this key could be programmed, not sure, but again..ASKING ME, would have been appreciated, so that I could have express my concerns about someone entering my car.  :/<//Review>

Friendly service, very helpful. The young lady there made sure I was helped and always with a smile.
That's very rare these day. I will surely continue to get my keys made there.<//review>

I went on a Saturday, it's a small shop, and the one employee was friendly and quick. I needed a laser cut car key for my Hyundai and also a USPS mailbox replacement lock, and he had both.< /Review>

High security car key was broken and I was recommended to Kwik Key. Tom is the best, professional, friendly, efficient, and knowledgeable. I will recommend Kwik Key services to anyone. Not only was I in and out in less than 10 minuets but I didn't feel swindled. Prices are competitive and did I mention Tom was funny too. Thanks Tom for making my day less stressful.<//Review>

Gotta be best locksmiths in So Cal...literally. After relying on this company a few times I can honestly say high quality service at a great price seems to be the standard. Give Kwik Key the opportunity to be your go-to for locksmith services/products and I'm sure they'll do their part to keep your loyal business.<//Text>

Good service. Friendly folk. Excellent price on a remote for my Prius. $250 for one that costs $400 from a Toyota dealer. The $250 still seems like a lot, but I know most of that is due to Toyota's wholesale price to them.< /text>

< Review>
Wouldnt make a house key without me bringing in the lock.  I'm not bringing in the whole door.  They said they will make the key with a trip out to my place, with fees of course. Said it was "law" .  Asked them wich law, said it was a "locksmith law"   Total scam trying to male extra money.  Went to their competitor  and did it no problem.<//Review>

Kwik Key has good service. The lady at the front desk  (cant think of her name) was nice and kind... showed  me multiple option for my  mailbox lock and was very informative. Wait time was short. I will send  other people to Kwik key and i will be returning to them if i need a locksmith.<//Review>

I went to a local "Home improvement store" for a set of keys to be duplicated and well they did not work, went back and they "fixed a new pair" did not work again., then i was recommended to visit kwik keys and sure enough these guys did it right the first time, thank you :)< /Text>

I needed the actual key hole fixed on a Saturn and they told me to come in at around 10 or 1030. Coming from Rialto CA it takes about 1hour 40 minutes to get here. I get there and they tell me they can't fix it because it's a saturn and they just don't like working on these cars. What?! They waited to tell me this?< /text>

Linda called after I sent an information request on their website.  She was helpful, well informed, and scheduled an appointment for later the same day.  I received a text before Benjamin came to my home.  He checked the three items I needed worked on (toilet, garbage disposal & hardware for shower/tub), checked the parts I purchased for their compatibility, and gave me a fair price,  Ben was courteous, professional and efficient.  He checked with me whenever there was a snag or issue that needed my input, and found the proper way to get it done.  He took the time needed to get it right, and with my home of more than 30 years it took some time and effort.  Thank you Ben!
Had th;em out again to unclog a drain.  Still a five star!</text>

Thank you Big John's Plumbing of Riverside for your speedy attention, dedication to detail and honesty.
It happened during a 16 hour power outage, our water heater died. Not sure if it was the power outage or the fourteen years it's been doing a great job of heating our water. Our son is a contractor and recommended we call Big John's Plumbing in Riverside. It was Saturday so we called and left a message. Someone at Big John's Plumbing called on Sunday morning and we confirmed that the repair could wait until Monday morning. Mr. Ramon showed up Monday and worked for three hours+ to replace the water heater. He ran into several non-compliance methods used when the original water heater was installed. He revised and installed the correct connections and insured we were up to code. We had hot water an hour after Mr. Ramon's departure.

We would recommend Big John's Plumbing, for any of your plumbing needs, I'm sure, but especially if you are in need of a new water heater. They've got you covered.<//review>

I have used John multiple times and will always call him when I have a plumbing need.  He is honest and always gives me options so I can make the choice that works best for our family and budget.  I believe that his prices are fair and I trust him to advise me when I am having plumbing issues.  I recommend him every chance I get!< /Review>

Big John's is my go to for plumbing issues in my house and when others ask me for referralsj to a plumber. Today's repair was a toilet issue which was done quickly and inexpensively. The first time I used this company it was an emergency sewer backup in my house during the holidays! They had a tech here in 20 minutes! They used a tiny camera to determine tree routes had grown into the sewer link under my driveway, then fixed the issue. (Talk about immediatley winning loyalty!) Thank you, John!<//Review>

I initially met John through Angie’s List years ago and was very impressed. Did not hesitate to call him again and he surpassed our expectations. Stayed until the job was done. Great price and would definitely call him again and recommend him. Call BIG JOHN!!! Love his work ethics.<//text>

Many thanks to John Hernandez, owner of Big John's Plumbing. Ramon, from his company, came out yesterday and replaced our pressure regulator, which showed over 100 pounds of pressure. This was dangerously high. Now, it's at 60 pounds, which is in the safe range. Based on another quote we received, we got a very good price, too.

Another neighbor also had dangerously high pressure, which they did not notice until the water line behind their refrigerator burst and caused thousands of dollars of damage to their home.<//review>

Big John came to my house last year when I had a serious slab leak. He quoted, analyzed it, and fixed it for pennies of the many other quotes that I had received. His work is performing perfectly since. This company is AWESOME. Thank you</Review>

First time using this company.  John came shortly after calling to repair main line leak.  Replaced regular piping with all  new copper pipe. He was professional, fast and the pricing was great! This company shines with integrity throughout. So glad to see there are still great people in this world. This will be my company to call whenever I need them.</review>

I will always use Big John's Plumbing in the future. John was honest, knowledgeable and priced fairly. After seeing other local plumber and getting quotes from 1200.00 to 10,000.00 dollarsf John fixed  my problem for under 200.00 dollars.  Very thankful to John! You can rest a sured that you'll be treated fairly  and get quality  job done!<//text>

I've used Big John's Plumbing for all my plumbing emergencies for years. They are dependable, professional, and extremely customer-service oriented. They have also replaced my hot water heater and, this week installed a reverse osmosis water system. Wouldn't call anyone else!< /text>

<resp>None<//resp><Review>Today I took on a small plumbing project as I thought it looked easy enough. Well after a few choice words, 1 large water soaked towel and a few buckets of water I called Big John's Plumbing. Within an hour a Big Josh's van arrived at my house. Marvin assessed the issue and explained what he was going to do to stop the leak. Marvin completed the task in no time. Marvin was professional in his presentation and I will definitely call Big John's Plumbing before I attempt another small plumbing project.< /Review>< date>

< Review>
Very satisfied with the service I received from Big John's plumbing.  I had an issue with a toilet and needed help right away.  I called Big John on a Saturday in the middle of the day.  He didn't have anyone he could send right away, but did take the time out of his day (and potentially money out of his own pocket) to explain the issue to me and walk me through how to fix it.  His advice was good and I was basically able to fix it on my own.  I was unsure if I had done it right so I called Big John again on Sunday a.m. and he came out same day and helped me check it out.  He didn't even want to charge me (though I made him take something) and was very helpful, very cool.  I would definitely recommend Big John's if you want to hire someone you can trust and who is very much focused on customer service.  Thanks Big John!</Review>

<Text>I have had Big John or one of his associates out on several occasions to work on my tiny Wood Streets pipes.  Each time they have been clean, courteous, and taken care of my issue for a fair amount.  They always give me options and tell me what their recommendation is.  I trust him and his guys completely and will always use them!< /Text>< Rating>

I bought this condo and found out there is no water in the bathroom sink. It turned out the downstairs neighbor has capped the pipe in order to fix a leak. John came in, helped me to diagnose the problem and fixed the pipe in the least invasive way. When my the neighbor downstairs refused to share half of the cost as we agreed before, Lynda  volunteered to call her and resolved the issue. Excellent service, reasonable price! Thanks for the great work John and Lynda!< /review>

<review>Funny how some people will do anything to collect some money anyway possible. I call this plumber to get a quote for a job. Owner John asks me to text him the property address so i send him my text with details. They go out and Marvin one of their plumbers call me and leaves me a message to call back. I call back and no one gets the phone so I leave a message to call me back as soon as possible due to the urgency of the repair. No call so I text back and request to find out what happened and to send me their estimate to my email or a photocopy of their estimate. No response until 2 weeks later I get a text asking for my last name so they can send me a bill for $105 service charge. Crooks. A month later I get a call asking for money so I kindly explain to them what happened and they tell me they sent the invoice to my email. I never received the email so I ask the lady what email address did you send to. She gives me the wrong email address so I let her know you sent to the wrong email address. I check to see if i sent John the wrong email address but no the email address I sent the owner is correct. So clearly some idiot did not send the quote to the correct email. Conversation leads to them threatening me that they will send this invoice to collections. They will get nothing from me for this rather I will make sure all my contractors, clients, and friends in the area never use this company ever again.< /review><username>Kevin C<//username>< Rating>

I had a water leak in the kitchen wall from a cold water pipe. My insurance said they weren't going to cover any of the damages. :(  I called BJP and they sent a plumber by the name of Phil. Phil was very friendly and was able to find the leaky pipe in the wall without having to cut too much to get to it. He stopped the leak and repaired the pipe for a great price! I highly recommend BJP for their great service and thorough work!!</Text>

<Text>I called in the morning sent them the picture of the Info for the water tank, I was told that they would need that to order the parts. That afternoon a plumber comes out and tells me I need to order the part, that service call cost me $65.00 for something that they could have told me over the phone. He then told me that the actual repair would be $275.00. WOW!! Needless to say I got the part the next day and called a real profesional, they came installed for $100.00 This company is a rip off.</Text>< time>

I called Big John's on a Friday morning due to a stopped up toilet. He showed up and realized that he would need a longer snake than he had with him, and promised that he would return later properly equipped. The company shilly-shallied around all day, often not answering their phones and not responding to voice mails I left. Finally, at 6:10 pm, Big John called and said that there were some scheduling problems and that he would be happy to show up Monday morning. Our problem is that the person who needed the repair has a serious heart problem and his medication requires him to need the toilet every 10-15 minutes. Even that knowledge didn't move John to either get someone here to do the repair or to arrange with another plumber to cover for him. Big John's plumbing is a dishonest company because it doesn't live up to the promises it makes and doesn't make the repairs it promises. I will *never* call them again and recommend others to do the same. The company cannot be trusted.<//Review>

<Text>Our water heater was making really loud, banging noises for about a year.  I thought that we were going to need an entirely new water heater, but it turns out that it was just in need of a flush.  The fact that John came out and recommended the flush, and not a preplacement tank, was very nice considering that I was ready to pay for the replacement.  Water heater works fine now.  I strongly recommend Big John's Plumbing.<//Text>< pictures>

Our place out in Riverside was having a few issues with drains backing up, even after we cleaned them out.  I called Big John up and he came right out, did a camera inspection, and made everything flow like new again.  We will definitely be repeat customers.</Text>

Fantastic, fast service. We had a clogged kitchen drain in an island with no clean out. I needed fast service in the local area. John was professional courteous, and knowledgable. From the first call to problem solved was an excellent experience. I would (and will) recommend Big John's to friends, family, and colleagues!</Review>

Marvin was awesome, came out to my house same day and recommended more extensive work than we expected.   Everything was explained in good detail, so I knew I wasn't being unnecessarily upsold, he and Big John were friendly, knowledgable and courteous. The repairs were made to my plumbing and I feel confident that my drain will now function as intended without problem. All of my initial testing shows that their work quality is good along with the fit and finish of the work, i'm a satisfied customer. :)< /review>

I called Big John’s Plumbing around 9:30 am on Sunday after reading positive reviews.  The phone was answered right away and I asked if they could come snake because my main was clogged.  John told me he could be here between 11:00-12:00, and he showed up when he said he would.  I showed him the roof access to my main (which is unfortunately the only access I have).  He was very honest and upfront with me and took his time assessing whether his snake line would be sufficient to reach the distance needed to clear the line (roughly 100-120 feet).   It was so nice to have someone really assess the situation first.  I know some companies/workers will perform the work knowing ahead of time it won’t solve the problem, and then charging the customer for it.  John didn’t do that.  He evaluated the situation first and let me know before hand what my chances were of reaching the clog, and then he let me make the decision to proceed with the work.

John was able to clear the clog, and then he made sure everything was flowing properly before cleaning up.  Big John worked fast, competently, and was very friendly and respectful the entire time he was here.  The price he charged me at the end of the work performed was exactly what he quoted to me on the phone and it was $100 less than what I paid a big named plumbing company, for the same work, 2 years ago.  He told me he offers discounts on his website as well as on Yelp.  Then he gave me a 10% Military discount off my bill.  Thank you John for your fast, friendly, upfront and honest service.  I can now take a shower!!!</Review>

<review>Ok.  To make a long story short, I didn't call Big John in the first place.  I learned my lesson the hard way and I will now NEVER use anyone else.  I went with another plumber and $2000 dollars later the problem was not fixed.  I had this other plumber over four times and he kept blaming my tenants. My tenants could not take a shower their first week there.  I was completely embarrassed.

I called Big John on an early Saturday morning and he swung by noon on time.  He took a look at the situation and took care of the problem lickity split.  My tenants were hesitant because of the last plumber.  We had water running in all the bathrooms, showers, sinks, flushing toilet paper down the toilet and trying to bombard the system.  What do you know..,everything was working.  Thanks Big John.

Here are my reasons to recommend Big John:

First: He was on time in my emergency plumbing issue
Two: Big John was fair and reasonable.
Three: He actually solved the plumbing problem
Four: He not only solved the problem he gave me some options for the future to make the situation easier but didn't use any scare tactic, just honest assessment on what to plan for in the future
Four: He is now my go to Plumber.

I had to spend a ton of money to find a plumber for life.  He's great and I highly recommend him to anyone.  He's a business owner/plumber that is fair, honest and reasonable.  He started his own business to run his business his way and I appreciate his knowledge and professionalism.  Thanks Big John for all your help!< /review>< pictures>

John was the only plumber I could find that was willing to come out next day to unclog a bathtub. He was extremely friendly and took the time to explain everything to me. Not only did he address my immediate needs, but I asked him to give me a quote on a shower that had been broken for over a year.

A previous plumber diagnosed a broken valve and had quoted over $1200 for the repair. He also said they would need to create an unsightly hole in our shower wall or cut into the shower from the outside wall (which would add to the cost).

John was able to diagnose and fix the shower within an hour!  We paid nowhere near the original estimate on the repair.  He also gave us recommendations on a general contractor, electrician and cleaning service!

John is our plumber for life!</review>

<Review>We had a plumbing problem at our home, and we hired a local plumber, who totally botched the job, and caused more damage.  Then they literally walked off the job, leaving a huge mess.  We called Big John's Plumbing, and they came out first thing the next day.  They fixed the original problem, as well as the additional problem caused by the original plumbers for less than half the cost of what the first plumbers were going to charge me.< /Review>< pics>

They have been out 3-4 times to block more gaps, but still seem to be missing something.  Traps have caught a few in the attic, but rodents seem to not be very interested in their bait.  I have to call them every couple weeks for follow-up otherwise I get no service.

On the plus side, the technicians, office staff, and supervisor are very nice.

I am sad to write a negative review because I believe in positivity, but I feel remiss if I do not state my ongoing frustration with rodents to other potential customers.  I cannot recommend their rodent service, especially in light of how much money it cost up front.</Review></record>

Have been using Clark Pest for over 2 years. We moved to another city and the transition was seamless. I have zero tolerance for creepy crawlers in our home and there were immediate results after a tech came to spray our new home. Easy monthly payments and completely worth it.</review>

I would definitely recommend Clark Pest Control over any other company of its kind.<//text>< user_id>

I guess this Company knows other pest control competitors stoped working and marketing so they took their chance to market themselves. they put their employees and residents health in danger. the young guy (their employee) was wearing mask. no one ring our bell for long time due to covid then he showed up. I told him it was wrong to do this at this time and i cannot talk to him then he walk away in a very impolite way. I remember their name because my name is also Clark.

Pls don't market ur company when everyone was under quarantine. have some business and basic ethnics!</Review><Name>Clark Z<//Name>< resp>

I am a former employee of this office. I cannot say enough good about my experience and the enjoyment of working for this office. The mentality was to teach and train excellent employees and representatives of Clark pest control, but moreover they also invested in each one of us as employees and gave us knowledge, resources, and long skill training so we could be our best selves and fulfill our potential with the company or in other endeavors we were passionate about. As idealistic as this sounds, it truly is the mentality of the management. The office staff reflected this positive environment with punctuality and professionalism daily. I still think about the many interpersonal, management, and professional skills I gained while employed by this office even though I work in a completely different field now. Top notch for those looking for employment or for those looking for services!<//text>

<review>I gave them 5 stars because I get what I pay for. They’ve taken care of my house and over the last few summers I haven’t seen any ant activity, which was my main issue, and its been great. My tech is friendly and is attentive to the requests we have when we notice any new pest issues. Whenever I have to call customer service they’re friendly, professional and prompt and they care about my concerns. Overall, I’m happy with my services with Clark and I look forward to having them as my ongoing pest control company.</review><Rating>5<//Rating></record></dataset><record>

I appreciated Josh for being very punctual. Josh was a very friendly, very helpful young man who came to investigate some scratching noises in my walls. He couldn’t have been nicer. He walked and crawled around my entire house to find any possible holes for rodent entry. He plugged up 2 holes and set traps under my house for possible rats. He returned in a week, found a rat in the trap and disposed of it. Josh was polite, thorough and a delight to work with! I would strongly recommend him to anyone!<//Review>

He responded immediately with several  soultions, offered to come by and determine which one was best for us. Bottom line, no more gophers, best service we’ve ever received and should a friend or family member need help with pest control issues, will ONLY recommend Jared and Clark Pest Control.

<Review>Great service!  Update for June 13th, 2019. Wish I could give six stars. Completely happy with their service and technicians. I've had other companies knock on my door to try and get my service, and tell them the same thing. Completely happy! Have been with them since before they were Clark. Used to be with Simple Pest Solutions which was taken over by / bought by Clark Pest Control and have and will remain a loyal customer. They quickly respond to any of my concerns or needs.  Technicians are always prompt and polite. Two big thumbs up to Hector, and to all of their staff. Keep up the great work and thanks!</Review><username>Frank Muller</username><Response>{'time': 1548387137093, 'text': 'Glad you were pleased with our service!

<Text>Clark Pest Control has been used for years in my family, starting on the Central Coast. Knowing that I have a loyal, and quality company taking care of our home here in Temecula gives so much peace of mind. We use Clark Pest Control to manage rats, as well as your usual ants, spiders, etc. They arrive on time for service, as well as leave a clean space after completion of work. Overall, we are happy with the service, and are very happy to not hear rats in the attic, or have ants on the kitchen counter! Thank you Clark Pest Control!</Text>< UserId.>

<Review>They try to over charge you and you have to keep a very close eye on when and how much they are billing you for.  When you show them the records of payment they continue to try to bill you for more then you owe.  They also don't call you to schedule the service they just show up and do the bare minimum and then you have to ca them back out when you have a problem< /Review>< pictures>

What kind of company goes to people's houses unsolicited, allegedly performs services and then sends them a bill? They show up unannounced at my house in the middle of the week while I was at work and left a business card followed by a bill.

I didn't know this company even existed. I had never even contacted them for an estimate. I didn't contract with them to provide any services. They trespass on my property and expect I should send them a check for the privilege. Now they're sending me dunning billings with interest charges.

I called their customer service twice with no response and followed with a detailed e-mail advising that I would submit a complaint with the Better Business Bureau and share my experience on social media. I gave them over a month to respond and guess what? No response.

I just filed my complaint with BBB and here I am on social media.

Run from these people. Truly a pathetic company with ZERO customer service<//Text>

I am very pleased with my service from Clark Pest Control. The price is very reasonable and they are very thorough when they come to my home. They will even make extra trips to my home if needed. I definitely get excellent service and recommend them to anyone looking for pest control. Please try them first!</text>

<text>Excellent service.  Technician (Richard Lamb) took the necessary time to do a complete job, including those areas of concern (spiders) which I pointed out to him.  At the conclusion of the service, Richard took time to explain that which he had done. Very pleasant young man.  Never gave me the impression that he was on some sort of time schedule to where he had to get to the next job.</text>< pictures>

Great  company!!! I called due to a colony of ants that has hijacked our  house. The person I spoke to on the phone was super friendly and knowledgeable. The technician, Chris, called ahead with notice,  showed up on time, and was very friendly, respectful, and professional.  He answered all of our questions and took his time, making sure to treat everywhere needed. A fantastic experience overall and I've definitely found my pest control company. I definitely recommend them!</text>

Good Afternoon,
The reason I will give Clarks a 1 star review is because their lack of integrity to finish in a timely matter. Spoke to Chris who is the on sight supervisor. We discussed original bid, certain damages, and if we could get job done on time. They were well aware of close of escrow timing and confirmed they could get job done on time. They then started work for local treat and fumigation. I was then told AFTER they started the job that the  balcony could not be done on time and there was no way they could get a sub contractor out in time and needed permits. I was told it could take up to 90 days and could not give me an exact date! It was only after calling and complaining to their office admin that they told me 30 days, and gave me a date. Yet they started the work for fumigation and local treat right away. Clarks claimed that they would call city for answers and that they kept getting "hung up on by the city inspectors office". I had to personally go to the city and speak to inspector to attempt to expedite the process. Because of Clarks seller will pay an extra month on their mortgage and buyers who have already given a thirty day notice will have to figure something out. It is crystal clear that they could expedite the process with hiring a diffrent sub contractor, but they refuse to. Clarks clearly does not care about their clients, nor damages they have caused their clients. If timing is a concern I would recomend searching elsewhere. Their employees have very little integrity and pride of work. I also had to have roofer replace extra tiles becasue during fumigation process they broke a few extra tiles. Also, while taking tent off they broke a fence and left with out bothering to fix it. I had to call onsite manager to have them bring someone back to fix it. Will not be doing bussiness with Clarks in the future. Hire Clarks at your own risk.<//Text>

Customer service sucks!! I've had to call them various times because no one has shown up. They give you a 4hr. window and I always seam to be the last one. Late 1/2hr -45min. late with no call to let me know they're running late. I'm ready to change pest companies!<//text>

I have a business-to-business realationship with Simple and have done business with the Simple Pest Solotions team for about two years now and I can easily say they are a fantastic company.

My company works with dozens of pest control companies around the US and Simple has fantastic pricing for their customers, great service and super friendly staff.  I highly recommend them.<//text>

Had this service back in 2014. Called when I moved and was told they didn't service my new address since I was moving out of riverside county and "you know what, don't worry about it" about my contract since they didn't service that area. Flash forward to this past month and low and behold there's a fee in collections from them. As always people's word is worthless, get it in writing...<//text>

We've been using simple pest solutions since we purchased our home in 2014. Have never had any ants, and when I've seen one too many spiders they come out and do a respray ASAP. We've been very happy with our service.< /text>

Recently had an exterminator come out from Clark’s for German roaches and as of 3 weeks it seems like it was poorly done or simply didn’t work ! When is the usual 2nd appointment?</Review>

Overall really good! The ambiance of this place is kinda weird, but the food is really good! I ate the farm fresh sandwich and drank the  beat juice, both were great. The ingredients are fresh and delicious. I would recommend it.</Text>

<Review>two days ago was our first time in this place. But It is definitely not the last time. We had a good time with the efficient service, with the fine  cuisine and booze and with the honest charge. We will no doubt visit there in a short time.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

Parking is not easy, but so worth it for an affordable lunch spot in Hollywood.< /review>< pictures>

Very best breakfast in 3 weeks California. So delicious and fresh! You have to try it!

The plastic forks an knives are useless. It's to soft. But this is no problem for the taste.<//Review>

Tasty juices, healthy sandwiches and cool staff. It's a nice little spot to people watch too - as it's just off Hollywood Blvd.
Great!< /Review>

<Review>Best place in the neighborhood for FRESH, QUALITY food.

The owner is at the register every day, and he's a great guy who takes care of local regulars.

I come here at least twice a day, and I usually get the same thing: famous turkey sandwich, with egg added, plus a double cappuccino.

Heaven.< /Review><Name>Benjamin Sanchez</Name>< GmapID>

<Review>Everything exceeded our expectations. Juice was perfect. Salads were excellent. Soup not so hot (no pun intended). Piece I couldn't figure out was why there's no recycling. This palace screams "nature" but with all the plastic being used, recycling would certainly give them a bump up in my heart. Folks that work here are awesome. I'd come back.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None</response>< GmapID>

(Translated by Google) If you're looking for breakfast while staying in Hollywood, this is the place! The salmon sandwich made with fresh vegetables was very good. The staff are very pleasant, friendly and the coffee tastes good!

헐리웃에 묵으면서 아침먹을데 찾는다면 바로 이곳! 신선한 야채로 만들어주는 연어샌드위치가 아주 일품이었다. 직원들도 매우 유쾌하고 친절하며 커피맛도 괜찮은편!<//Review>

<review>Best agency in town! I’ve been to quite a few in area and none of them were as quick to get me out to work.  The staff were so kind, helpful, understanding of my situation and listened about my work experience. The company they sent me to was a great environment, potential to be hired and really good pay. I highly, highly recommend!< /review>< resp>

The Staffmark La Puente office provided me with excellent service and a great job opportunity with a local company. Andrea, Mia and Karina were so helpful and informative about my job duties and what was expected of me. I am referring all my friends and family who are job seeking to this office.< /Review>

<review>My experience with Staffmark was amazing! I have read reviews that described the employees that work in the office are rude,  not true! They are very professional and that is what they expect from us, the people that they are getting a job for.  So if you want to get treated special maybe this is not the place for you. They got me into an amazing company and now  it is up to me to prove that i belong there. So toughen up people and remember, they did not go knocking on your door,  and if you comply with what they need from you,  then you will get placed at not only a job,  but a career.</review>< Pictures>

<Review>Worst place to go to  ... I waited almost 5 months and nothing ended up going to ultimate staffing and they eventually found me a job within 2 weeks. The staff is rude and all they do is sit around and talk about their crazy drunk weekends.<//Review>< rate>

<Review>(Translated by Google) The secretary I think that they should pay her more. For what I spoke, she remains silent when speaking with her, that is why they have 3 stars for poor attention with the person I give her -1

This store embodies how I want to raise my child. Full of wonder, full of awareness, and full of kindness towards the world. When you enter the store, you feel like a kid again. There are unique, colorful, informative, silly, and just plain fun toys, books, decorations, gifts, etc. I wish I lived closer! I have already made many online purchases until the next time I can go in person. And I love the way they decorate their packages!<//Text>

Such a wonderful store for kids toys, books, and more! Love the message of this place to promote equality and inclusivity. A safe place for everyone. We were helped by the kindest man. Really happy we stumbled into this store and bought some fun toys and unique books for our nephew!</text>

<review>This is our go to shop when we have our grandchildren with us. They love going to the “rainbow” store. The book selection is the shining star of this shop. The staff is always friendly and so very helpful when you have a four year old who insists on looking at each and each single thing before picking an item. We are so very lucky to live close by and visit often.</review>< Pics>

This cute little toy shop caught my 2.5 year old’s eye and we went in. It has such an array of toys that I can’t find anywhere. You can tell they put a lot of thought into the items they sell. I encourage you to take your little one in there because they’re going to love it! Both my daughter and I wanted everything in it! Or if you’re too far- their website is great for online orders! Support small businesses if you can.</Text>

Onederchild is an absolutely magical little toy store! I go to get gifts for all of my nieces and nephews as well as whenever I need a gift for any child (or anyone who's a child at heart). You can tell that they really go out of their way to find toys that are not the normal plastic stuff you can grab anywhere but beautifully crafted thoughtful items, which makes it possible to get gifts even for the kids who have everything! I absolutely adore their "Social Conscious Library" book section, their books are all about self love and inclusion and are the PERFECT thing for anyone trying to raise a good tiny human. I love this store and wholeheartedly recommend it to any and everyone looking for toys or books for little ones!<//Review>

One of the best children’s stores I’ve ever had the pleasure of stumbling upon. A magical realm where children can explore and create in a safe environment filled to the brim with amazing toys and art supplies. Their dedication to furthering not only children’s intelligence but emotional well being is extremely apparent. I would give this shop a ten star review if I could. Absolutely Onderful 🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤<//review>

< Review>
This store was our favorite in town. When we moved out of the area, I was most sad about leaving this store but luckily we can still online order. The vibe of this store is just so much love. The owners are amazing and the sweetest. When I am looking for cool, unique toys I check out their online or Instagram first, and if you need some new literature to help continuously raise socially conscience, informed, progressive children, this is the store to check out.
My boys love “the rainbow house store” and always ask to go back!</Review>

<Text>ONEderChild is the most thoughtfully enchanting, and beautiful toy stores we’ve ever been in. The staff was helpful, full of laughs,  and the whole vibe of the store was a perfect blend of fun and educational; everything a children’s toy store should be. The sweet offerings of woke literature and fun is just the perfect blend to a great experience. Grab some stickers at the checkout by a local artist. They’re fantastic!</Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

<text>I live about an hour away from Onderchild, but follow them on Instagram because they have such an incredible variety of quality items for kids. When the holidays rolled around, I ordered through their online store and got awesome gifts for my kids and nieces and nephews that I wouldn’t have been able to find anywhere else. The kids loved them! (The unicorn waist pack was especially a hit!) I love supporting this store!< /text>< user_name>

<Text>Every time I go inside Onderchild, I am instantly happy!!! It is where I go to buy every birthday gift for my kids and their friends. The book section is on point- I never leave without a book! Not only does this store offer so much happiness, it also gives back in a BIG way to local organizations like Angel Foster Care, amazing store with a beautiful  cause behind it!!< /Text>< pics>

<text>The best shop in Solvang. A must visit. Excellently curated toys, gifts and books!!! The staff is so friendly. They’re beyond cool with kids testing the merch (such a relief in a store). Stop I , say “hi”, grab that gift for your cousin’s baby. It’s the best!<//text><resp>None<//resp><rating>5< /rating>< GmapID>

Walked into this store on a road trip from so cal to Paso Robles. I was drawn in by the rainbows, and my wife and I were so happy to see a store full of products for kids with families that look like ours. We have been ordering Christmas and birthday gifts for my nephews since discovering this place, and we can’t wait to visit again on another Solvang trip!< /text>

Great staff and card selection. Good and fair prices. Plenty of snacks and room as well. Well lit. Cleaner then most card shops. Good store culture. Staff always adheres to pandemic guidelines and has masks and plenty of hand sanitizer as well which is nice and doesn't make you feel guilty for coming out to support in these times.< /review>

Hands down the best and my favorite card shop in sac town. At other stores, I’m just treated like another customer, but I really like how Corey and his staff actually care about you and take the time to talk to you. You can tell that they love what they do, and it reflects in how they run the business. This will always be the first place I go to, whenever I need anything card or tabletop game related. Great prices, and great service.<//text>

I stopped by the other day to kill time, and had a blast looking at all the cards and even picking some up. I met the owner Corey, and he was so kind and genuine! I will definitely be stopping by the next time I am in town!< /Text>

<text>I came in looking for advice on card sleeves for my Villainous deck and also for a set of die.. I was not disappointed by the customer service from Corey. He gave me a lot of detailed info on sleeves and special ordered me 3 packs.

Corey and his wife are such sweet and genuine people, both helpful and welcoming to anyone that comes in their shop whether they are new or experienced. Corey is an encyclopedia of knowledge that really levels with his customers in a way that you don't often find. You will never find customer service lacking in any way here. It's a fun, family friendly shop that I most highly recommend to all.

1st time going in here and I loved how helpful they were at helping me find the right card sleeves I was looking for. Wasn't the biggest sale for them probably, but they still took the time to answer every concern I had and even took out there own collection to show me just how the sleeves would look and feel. I'll definitely be recommending Corey's to all my friends!<//Text>

<review>This is the best card game/Magic location in the Sacramento/Placer area. I've gone to a lot of other locations in the area for Magic and I always find myself wanting to come back here to play. Corey and his wife are super knowledgeable about the game, plus they will teach you how to play and talk strategy with you. They have tournaments multiple times a week for Magic and the people that go here are fun to play against and are friendly as well. If you haven't stopped by here to play, you should stop by for a Friday Night Magic or Saturday standard showdown.<//review><GmapID>0x809adfd30776b437:0x8b6a5c953968ece3< /GmapID><user>112517392993586428323<//user></record>

The owner knows his stuff and had me leaving the store with way more than I originally meant to, and that isn't a bad thing.

He showed me different kinds of paints and tools that I didn't even know were a thing, and really helped my models look even better.

I highly suggest this store for all nerdy stuff. The store is smaller, but they are still quite filled with merch. Always worth a look if you are in the area.</review><UserId.>118348262725262547296< /UserId.>< rate>

I went to Corey's to pick up a few single magic cards to complete my deck. I'm new to the game and Corey was more than happy to teach me a few things about my cards and strategy in general. This is by far the best experience I've had at any card shop in the area. I will definitely be coming back, Corey and his wife are great people who are passionate about the game.<//review>

This is by far the best shop I have been to. It is family run and it just has that welcoming feeling. Corey and family are above and beyond when it comes to customer service. And they are always willing to help teach you some things or help you build a deck. This is honestly the best gem in our area for MTG and other tcgs.< /Text>

<Review>I haven't played or shopped here in a while on account of moving across the state but I'd recommend this shop to anyone I know purely based in knowing the owner.

Corey is a great guy who was running a great shop last I left it.

He has fair prices, listens to the community that plays at his shop and just genuinely cares about providing a good experience to his customers.

Last I was there the place was a little small and under renovations but I'm sure by now the place is looking spiffy.

I have lived in LA now for almost 8 months and have yet to find a shop that comes close to Corey's shop in terms of all around experience.

The only negative I have or had against the shop was just general size of the shop and it's general location, but you can't always get everything you want.

Oh also last I checked he was very active in getting different community events, games and different formats going.

So yeah if you want a place with an owner who loves card games and cares about providing a quality place to shop and play this is where you wanna be.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures><response>None<//response>< gmap_id>

< review>
this is the only place to go for all your MTG needs as well as many other similar games an collectables. Corey is a great guy an knows his stuff, he is always willing to answer any questions you may have. he shares a passion for the products an games he sells many nights you'll find him sitting at the tables playing right along with many of his more regular patrons laughing an joking along you could easily mistake him for just another player there trying out their new mtg deck build an having fun with good friends. Cory also buys cards as well an from my experience his shop is by far the best place to sell mtg cards, he always has the fairest offers an wont try to get one over on you ever. he is a kind an honest shop owner an really just wants to share his passion with as many as he can. If you do plan to sell cards here I would suggest selling to Corey directly as his other Mainstay employee has at times tends to be a little less fair an honest about his offers an rarely takes time to make sure the customer isn't being taken advantage of due to them simply being ignorant of card values an how card shops work. bottom line is when it comes to card shops ill take Cory's card shop over any big name shop like,  A1 Comics an others like them, ANY & EVERYTIME without a second thought. ive been a customer here since Cory's opened his shop an have loved it ever since. Not to mention that the location holds a special place in my heart as the card shop that was there many years prior to Cory's opening, was actually where my love hate relationship with Magic the Gathering all began back in February of 1998 id just turned 9 an with my birthday money i purchased my first ever booster pack of MTG. the set was stronghold an rightfully so it seem because MTG has had a strong hold over me ever since.<//review>

<user>113569147882901363122<//user><Text>Corey's was a recommendation for somewhere to go for miniatures and Magic goodness. The storefront is clutter free with plenty of space to sit and play Warhammer or Magic and other such games. Stock is pretty solid with a whole host of the latest MtG sets as well as a cool selection of specific cards too to peruse. Staff was friendly, welcoming and helpful, definitely would recommend and return to on the future< /Text><GmapID>0x809adfd30776b437:0x8b6a5c953968ece3< /GmapID>< name>

The nicest and most knowledgeable people for TCGs and table-top RPGs here in Citrus Heights. Great card selection with a comfortable atmosphere in the shop. Also great clientele to play with.</Review>

If I were still playing CCGs this would be my brick and mortar store for Magic the Gathering...I bet I could find someone to play Jihad with even!  The shop is branching out to Games Workshop games (40K, AoS) too with tables available and paint stations to get your modeling fix in.  On event days it may get crowded and loud, but that is a guess only at this point.  When I swing by Blondie's for a pie, I will,be sure to pop in to Corey's too.<//Review>< pics>

<review>The Best Greek Chicken Salad In Town! Where can you purchase a party size Greek salad covered in your choice of protein (Chicken for me) with 2 slices of garlic bread and all for $20... YES... you read correctly... $20! Only at Greek Chicken in El Cajon. I was surprised when I ordered the large salad the first time, I thought I had ordered a party size. It was no mistake, a large salad feeds 3-4 people.  Next time your in El Cajon try Greek Chicken 🐔.< /review><Time>1617713521896<//Time>< GmapID>

Generous portions of fresh and delicious Greek food. Our family has been eating here for over a decade. We usually split meals and still sometimes have leftovers. Their chicken is always moist and perfectly seasoned! But you really can't go wrong no matter what you order.

Use the app and do curbside because this place is ALWAYS busy. Plus, you can do all kinds of special/custom order selections through the app.

GC: Please bring back the pastrami!!</review>

Their gyro salad was good and their pita bread. I order the fried zucchini - it had no favor and their was plenty of grease on and in the bag. Canada burger is better.<//text>

Just went to Greek Chicken, my expectations where high just based on the ratings and reviews I've seen, but tbh I was really disappointed if I could give 0 stars I would, I've gone to other greek restaurants and the food is light-years better than this let me start off with the gyro meat, it was just plain it tasted as if it wasn't seasoned at all, the tzatziki was the same, tasteless, the salad you can see in the pics the size of the plate it only had 2 olives, the only good thing imho was the french fries they where well done and not oily, I will never come back to this place, its not worth paying over $30 for two gyro plates when it's tasteless and imo overpriced, the other greek restaurants have much more reasonable prices and much better tasting food! Very disappointed and dissatisfied with this place!< /text>

<text>Always fantastic. Everything is great: the roasted chicken and grilled both, the gyros, the salads, sauces and sides. Also, their app makes ordering and pickup super easy and convenient.<//text><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

One of my favorite places for delicious drive thru chicken... I always ask for their greek yogurt, it is amazing on all their food! Restaurant is directly off the 67 near La Mesa so it is easy to access.</text>

<Review>Wish I would have taken pics but...FOOD was so BIG and awesome, my camera didn't zoom out enough before it went in my belly. Had low expectations and was blown away!! Incredible sauces...all of them and seemed fresh. Fried zucchini instead of fries, gyro, and fish n chips all bomb!! Can't wait to go back!<//Review>< Pics>

<Review>I'm never dissapointed when I eat here.  Even before the Ronavirus, this establishment was kept clean.  The food is delicious and their portions are good!  I wish I would have taken pics of our salad.<//Review>< Rating>

< Review>
Worst burger you can ever taste , we ordered 3 of 1/4 pound burgers and they all came out burnt and tasted horrible. I don’t recommend you to come here regularly because of the food quality changes. On top of all that their customer service could’ve been better . The lady approached me over the phone with saying right away that if i wanted my food to be done right i have to bring them back the food for them to remake it . Very nice<//Review>

<review>Okay food 🍽, but quite repeatedly rude staff (3 diff times/staff) and very strange out-of-state big trucks 🛻 usually in drive-through blocking the way in the already long line🤬. They also usually treat people who look differently badly.... might not be worth it unless feeling extra hungry lol But hey, it's USA🇺🇸 it's expected, not surprised at all, just remember THIS place🎯😃🤫🙂😂😎</review>< date>

Absolutely love their fish & chips!  I really like their banana shakes as well.

Their gyros while very good are ironically not significantly better than Arby's.

Just be aware they often 'forget' to put vinegar cups in with the fish or only fill the cups by a half or third full!</Text>

Thank God that the food is really good but to get an extra salad dressing is a dollar 35 we just spent 40 $47 on food and they want to charge us for a freaking Ranch dress I think they need to change that policy< /Text>

This place is great. I usually get the Gyro Salad and I have found out you can substitute dressing for Feta! I always think it needs more feta. This made for a very delightful experience. I wish they had cooked the meat a little more like usual. I have never had a bad reaction with my allergies here! This was nice to find out something good out of this craziness. Chicken was a little dry this time but usually great as well.< /Review>

This chicken is absolutely THE best in all of San Diego County, if not in the entire state! There's one on Main Street and one on Graves Avenue, but we prefer Graves Avenue because it's much bigger with more booths and tables. The taste and tenderness of this chicken simply cannot be beat!< /review>

We always get the zucchini because it's fantastic. And their salads are also THE best because the salad is always crisp and fresh, and they use cucumbers, tomatoes and those awesome Greek olives (Kalamata) with a light dressing. Go here and you'll never be disappointed!!! Oh, and I also love their potato salad and I am very picky on potato salad!<//text>

This was my first visit to Greek Chicken. I used the drive through and ordered a gyro sandwich, fried zucchini and a medium unsweetened ice tea. The gyro sandwich was one of the best I've had. The meat had great flavor, and the tomatoes and onions were fresh. Their tzatziki sauce is thick and flavorful! No runny sauce here!
The medium size drink could be a few ounces larger. The fried zucchini was Hot and a generous portion. Really like it being in a cup that fit in my car's cup holder. So, the reason for 4 stars: the fried zucchini. It is more breading than zucchini, but the flavor was really good! I'm a veggie fanatic so I do like to have lots of veggie under the breading.</Review>

Service was good. I realize it's Greek Chicken but I had the 1/4 pound burger with a side of potato salad. $11.15 without a drink. If their going to charge $6. Something for one it should at least be hand made. It did look like the picture but no flavor. The potato salad was good and tasted homemade bit $4. for 1/2 a pint was crazy. I'm from North Carolina now and I know things are expensive with the 15 minimum wage and high cost of everything else. I don't know how or why people stay here anymore.<//Text>

Always happy with how great the food here is. I usually get chicken, rice and salad. The chicken and rice is usually dinner. The salad goes to work with me the next day and is still crunchy and delicious. Yummo!< /text>

<Review>This is by far some of the best middle eastern food that I have ever tried. My first experience was in my hometown of Tennessee. So you could probably imagine how that goes. Small town. Not as good. Not as open to new thing's. Very one sided with how things are ran just in general. I'm not saying it was bad, but to taste better authentic food that is made with love will make you rethink how food is suppose to be made. They take their time preparing the food even though they are a fast food restaurant. It's not made to order. Obviously some stuff is, but it is a few items on their menu. Yes some of their items are frozen, but it is still fresh. Just because it is frozen does not mean it is not fresh. Get the Gyros. Some of the best stuff. I'm telling you it is very addictive! The bread is to die for. The rice is phenomenal. Then you have the salads. I'm a ranch type of guy. Their blue cheese is good though. The milkshake's are okay. Personally I would recommend Beef n Bun for that though. I'm pretty big on good food. But this place is great!<//Review><Gmap_id>0x80d95847066a1089:0x6635a6f3ce86f9fc<//Gmap_id>< UserId.>

First time going here.... And it was really delicious. Has a gyro and some extras. It's post covid so just the drive through is active which was very very long. I was starving like Marvin so I suppose I didn't mind the wait.</Text>

They should open more of these around the county. Prefer them over your typical burger fast food restaurant. They sell a bit of everything and the food has really good flavor.</text>

The Greek style chicken is the bomb dude. Put a little bit of that hot sauce and some of that Tziki sauce and you are in heaven. The Gyro meat is nice and tender too. All their sides including rice, fries, onion rings and Greek salad are great. I can't wait to go there again< /Review>

Usually love this place. But right now - NO! Called in an order but if you pay with cash you still have to sit in the drive-thru line. After doing that for a little while I decided to just pay by phone because I really didn't want my food to get cold. Well that didn't work and it didn't matter anyway. I said no tomatoes ... apparently that means to put a bunch of tomatoes and smash them into the pita bread so it's extra soggy and not edible. Thanks guys.< /text>

Had scrambled eggs, hash browns, and biscuit with gravy. Eggs were a bit dry. Hash browns were cold, greasy, and tasted old. Biscuit was okay but gravy tasted over seasoned and it tasted of chicken boullion.<//Review>

Great food, gyros are large and delicious. Little pricey for a place with a drive thru. Expect to pay 40-50$ for a family of 4. It's worth it though.</Review>

Fast service good food and consistent every time we have ordered. Just make sure you are calling the right location if you are placing an order. The last thing you want it's to drive up to the wrong location be super hungry and realized that your order was placed in a different city. Doh!< /review>

They charged me for an extra item.  I received the extra item but didnt want it.  I called to get the extra item refunded and the manager said I would have to drive the extra item back to them.  I was so frusterated that this family owned business couldnt help me out.  I explained i would have to pack up my two children and elderly mom with dementia.  No sympathy, said it was policy.  Very disappointed.<//review>

Great Greek food. Gyros are Awesome! People are super nice. It was our first time for me and my two boys after a wrestling tournament. We were in need of some good healthy food and we found it all at Greek Chicken. Awesome experience!<//Review>

The Greek chicken salad is HUGE, and has BIG flavor. The gyro plate is full of flavor, and the baclava is soo good, especially with coffee. A place to go to for sure!</text>

Great place to eat! You will not be disappointed. Lots of tasty selections to choose from.  Prices a tad high, though. Clean restaurant. Fresh food.</text>

We love the food here at Greek Chicken. A great menu, good servings, and nice service. Clean and comfortable. A great place for the family or just a couple together. They also make a awesome banana split.<//Review>

<text>We love Greek chicken. We have been coming to all their locations since our 24 year old son was 18 months. It’s always fresh and delicious. We probably come at lease two to three times a month. Wish they would open one in La Mesa by where we live.<//text>< pictures>

<review>My food was fresh and hot, as it always is. But their were two different young ladies who helped me in the drive-thru and they weren't friendly at all. Usually they smile and say have a good day but they just took my money and shut the window. My previous times however was better service but with different people!< /review>< pictures>

I have been here twice and enjoy the food. Their grilled chicken is great. The Greek salads they make excellent; they don't put too much dressing on the salad so you can taste the salad components. Yesterday I tried a burger, I wanted to see if their burgers lived up to my expectations of a solid Greek restaurant and they did!
The burgers do not come with a side so I had pita and hummus. The hummus was amazing and there was enough here for 2-3 people. The dining area is neat and clean and the atmosphere is pleasant< /Review>

Their chicken is Overcooked and Dry! Just had it today after giving them another chance.    Way too salty and Lemony.   Couldn't even finish the whole meal for the pungent, strong, tart tangy flavor. They used to be fresh and delicious..this restaurant has gone down drastically in quality and taste!  WASTE :(</review>

Been going here for years.  Their Greek style food is excellent (if not perfectly authentic), well prepared & very tasty.  The meats are never underdone, their personnel are friendly & helpful and the prices are reasonable.  Something to please the whole family even if they have very different tastes\preferences.< /Review>

<review>One of my favorite spots to pick up some quick & yummy eats! Tender savory chicken flavored with lemon and herb, awesome fried zucchini sticks, the greek salads are great for individuals or family style, and to finish with a cone is always the way to go on hot days...just make sure your quick about it. ;)</review>< pics>

I had the chicken sandwich. I didn't know you could slice a chicken breast that thin. It was less than 1/4 inch thick. The music was annoying also. Why do these businesses  let the counter help pick the music? Obviously selected by a teenager.<//Text>

Dining area is big so plenty of seating available. I had a business meeting when I went and we had a good time there. The restaurant is good for family and friends. Plenty of free parking outside. This was my third time there and I'd still go there. The chicken tasted really good. 5 stars.< /Text>< Pictures>

Food here is always fresh, filling, and satisfying.
We ordered a Greek chicken salad, fried zucchini fries, and to chicken strip meals.
They have generous portions.
We visited on Easter, there were plenty of people, yet our food was not delayed. Staff handled the large crowed very well.
Clean eating booths and clean restrooms a huge plus!</text>

Greek Chicken is the best place for chicken ever!  Their large chicken salad is fantastic.  The chicken is cooked just right and there are onions, tomato chunks and sliced cucumbers in it. It is just right for me and my husbands dinner.   It comes with either pita bread or garlic bread and we always order a small order of  taziki sauce.  Its a great healthy dinner.<//Text>

We love the large Greek chicken salad for parties. Although they just raised the prices it is still worth getting, just not as great a deal anymore. The chicken pieces are really yummy with the lemony herb seasoning they use. I like the pitas and the zucchini fries, too.</review>

Good choice for Greek style food. Was a tad sticker shocked with the prices as we paid +$40 for a meal for 3 people. Portions are large and drive through is quick. Suggest you dine in before taking advantage of the drive through to figure out how how much food you need to order.</review>

I had three very hungry men and needed a lot of food. I was too tired to think. I told the girl that I needed help in ordering. I told her what I knew they wanted and asked her to help me choose the rest. She was just wonderful and patient with me. She even got help for me to take the food to the car. Everyone ate to the full and enjoyed it very much. Even me a 76 year old widow. I had the kids meal, it was just right for me.
Thank you all so very much.</text>

<Review>I love Greek food restaurant

The secrets of doing good food it's the focus on you item nuts Who many Mazda X many many items you failed the test how's the food but if you focus on a few of them there will be always tastes awesome I really like this place basically the restaurant since I lost I want to tell the owner of the business has to teach the employees when they carry that back with all the food and they supposed to mention what is inside the bag because is that enough to ask everything in there they will tell you yet but when you get home you will have something sarong< /Review>< Gmap_id>

Fast, friendly service. The food portions are generous. Everything was fresh, and we did not have to wait long for our order. I had the gyros salad, and we shared the half chicken plate with a mound of fried zucchini, garlic bread, and another dinner salad. We ordered a small banana split for our 3 and 5 y.o. girls, and they put it in 2 separate 8 oz. containers, which were filled overflowing and both with a cherry on top. Our girls were delighted and we were impressed with everything. Wish there was one where I live.</text>

We have been there several times... And enjoyed the food immensely... But today the chicken was extremely dry and the onion rings tasted like cardboard... Very disappointing ☹️... Hopefully next visit will be better...< /Review>

I haven’t been here in quite a while. I ordered the half chicken and salad meal. Totaling $15.35. Upon receiving my meal I asked for some Tziki Sauce. I was informed it it an additional $1.39 for Tsziki Sauce. Really? It’s a $15 meal you you want to nickel and dime for the sauce. I mean, it’s a Greek place, that sauce should come with everything. Wack.</text>

I love this place! Their Greek Chicken Salad is to die for and I can never get too much of their pita bread. I recently discovered they have other locations, such as Lakeside. This location is sometimes hard to get to because of the traffic off the 67 but is definitely worth the wait.< /Review>

Good food .  But, when I asked to have my large salad put in two smaller containers for my ice chest, they wouldn't help out.  Doesn't seem unreasonable to accommodate for a $25 take out order.< /text>

It's the perfect spot for any size crowd too. Large groups of people will be fed at a reasonable price, and singles are welcome too 😉. High Quality and Fresh Fast Food describes this place well. I've been impressed with the food at this place since I first tried them and I'm still stoked on their food now. It's a great family environment with top notch food. I highly recommend.< /Review>< pictures>

This place is by far one of the best greek places in SD. We love Olympic Cafe also but this place gives it a run for its money. They do not skimp on their portions. It's worth

Always on point, probably the best fish and chips I've ever had. The gyros are to die for, and the salad is amazing! Very tasty! We drive 15 miles every time we eat it, but it's worth the drive.<//review>

It's a place where you think they'll serve greasy fried food. Yes, you'll find that here. At the same time, you'll find yummy Greek gyros in here.  Personally, you can't get me to eat their chicken with a million dollars. However, pretty much other food is good. The price is decent. It's certainly a good place to stop if you've just survived sitting in DMV for hours.<//review>

Service staff is always friendly. Often this place takes awhile to get your food because they get busy. Decent enough food for fast food. Unfortunately I have a diet that does not allow me to have Dairy. I asked if their sauces were on the side and they said yes but did not tell me about any cheese that they would put into anything. Apparently it's automatic for them to put feta cheese in their food and it's so soft it mixes with everything so I threw away what I paid for. I will never come back here because they don't tell you what's in their food.</text>

<Name>Bob Arii</Name><Time>1563932694864</Time><Rating>5</Rating><review>We have  been coming to this recently updated, delicious place for many decades.  While the food may seem to cost a bit more, the quality and size of the portions are well worth it.

You order at the counter, fill your drink, get seated and wait for your number to be called..and if needed they will help yo carry your order to your table.

The salad are fresh and crisp.  While the chicken breast tends to be a bit dry, the other 'parts' are moist, delicious and have a tinge of lemony goodness that Greek chicken is known for...and the gyros (prounouced yeer-ohs) are simply spectacular!!!  I love to save some to put in a breakfast omelet with feta cheese.  Oh man!!!  Talk about heavenly leftovers!?!?!  I drool and dream for the next day to arrive.

The soft serve there is creamy and udderly (intended pun) decadent for the price!  Holy cow you've got to try it!!!

Should you like a bit better deal, you can order a half pound of Gyros meat and a half or full chicken, some pita bread and Tzatziki and a large Greek salad and feed 6 as long as they are not from a football team.

Fresh.  Flavorful.  Filling.  You can't go wrong if you stop to eat at Greek Chicken, Santee/El Cajon!!!</review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

Excellent food - ESPECİALLY for fast food. Solid, homestyle Greek food like Yaya used to make - if she had access to a pro kitchen...

Everything I have here has been very good - prices are reasonable and portions are large. Come hungry!<//review>

Food was really good. Service was great. The only problem we had was it was very messy. The tables hadn't been cleaned in a while and we were there for 35 or 40 minutes. They cleaned up about 10 minutes before we left.<//review>

<date>1531412768152<//date><Rate>2<//Rate><Text>Visited this location for the second time yesterday . I was very pleased the first time and so I ordered the 1/4 chicken , gyros , and salad as I did on my first visit . However, once my food came out it looked like about an 1/8 of a chicken or less, definitely a much smaller piece of chicken then I was served just a day ago . At this point I began to think it was not just my imagination that one of the cooks was glaring at me and wanted to say something but I was embarrassed,  hungry, and did not want to bother the girls working there though after I regretted not speaking up since I was still hungry. I dont think you should still be hungry after buying a $15 dollar plate of food . I was there at about 9:30 PM and there was several other customers who came in so there should of been plenty of chicken to serve me a healthy consistent portion . I was disappointed in spending that amount and feeling unsatisfied and unfull . Not sure when I will be ready to go back and give them another shot . Consistency is key in any business and cooks shouldn't be mad when customers come customers in close to closing time that's how you get paid you should be happy to have a job and it's only common sense that your going to be working after " closing time" if you work in a restaurant ..... send me a coupon to make up for this please . There seems to be a problem at many food establishments these days with cooks and workers wanting to clean up early and not understanding that "open until" means open until and they are to provide service happily until exactly that time .<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

The chicken here is insane good. The fried zucchini and onion rings and fries and pretty everything here is awesome, and the ranch, I don't know how they make even the ranch better than everywhere else but they do. I'm going to have to eat there tonight after writing this because now i'm thinking about how great it is. You need this place in your life, trust me.</text>

Great gyros and sundaes are like the old time soda fountain creations.  Chicken is good too.  Fast food atmosphere, friendly staff, little pricey.</Review>

Pros
Food is fresh
Flavorful and good
Melt in your mouth garlic bread
Friendly staff
Lots of seating

Cons
On a busy street
Limited parking
Bathrooms were not so clean but could be because it was busy.

I would definitely recommend this place.< /review>

We went here for the first time the other night with my brother in law and mother in law.  I have been wanting to try this place for awhile because I love chicken that they have a very cool sign!  The food did not disappoint!  We ordered giros, one half chicken, zuchini fingers and had a salad.  Everything was delicious, especially the dressing and the flavorful chicken!  The prices were very reasonable, the variety of items is great and service was fast and friendly.  It is easy to get to and even offers a drive through window!  We will definitely be returning!<//Review>

Went in on break from work last night and ordered one gyros sandwich. Not a complex order. They forgot to give the order to the Cook. 15 minutes later I got a refund and left. I was hungry all night. No apology, no comped meal, just a big disappointment. There was a guy there who was waiting 35 minutes until they realized they hadn't cooked his order. It's great not to make mistakes but when you do then treat your customers right. I'll never go back.<//Text>

<text>It should be ok to order a " GREEK " chicken plate and request GREEK Tzatiziki sauce, like at any other GREEK restaurant! But not here!!
They say it doesn't come with it so pay $1.35!!
What is that? $1.20 in mark up? Beware...</text>< Pictures>

Without a doubt some of the Best chicken I've ever had! The flavor explodes in your mouth while the chicken melts in your mouth. And while the chicken is the star, the Gyros and the burgers are just as sought after. Their menu is filled with new surprises as you work your way through it. Add a very bright and attractive dinning area,an easy to maneuver drive thru and your in for as good an experience as it gets. Warm,friendly staff,attractive surroundings,great food. Dont get much better.< /Review>

One of my very favorite restaurants, very clean, fresh food that is consistent from visit to visit, an all-around dependable choice. And the best aspect of it is the food is delicious every time.<//Review>

Love this location. Food is always cooked perfectly. The one on Bradley in El Cajon needs serious improvement. But Lakeside location has it locked in. They really know their customers, menu and how to treat people right.< /Text>

<Review>The girls and I at the office decided this would be a good place to grab food on our lunch break. No, I ended up missing part of my order and my fried zucchini was cold. Coworker #1 order her fried zucchini well done and it was still soggy when they gave it to here. And coworker #2 couldn't eat part of her meal because there was so much lemon it was inedible. We are all very disappointed<//Review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

Bought my greek chicken with french fries and they didnt give us any. We grabbed our food because we were in a hurry. Look in our bag to eat and no french fries! To top it all of. They give you so little food for what you pay for</text>

Laura from the drive through makes this place worth it! My order got messed up and she gave me my entire meal for free! I had ordered 24 Gyros! The customer service is just outstanding here! Laura won't be at this place for long. I suspect she'll get promoted soon! Hopefully I can still get the same level of service when she's gone. As for the food quality, I dont think there's a better place to get greek fast food anywhere! I would recommend this to anyone!<//Text>

This place has good food, but I'm so sick of them being cheap and petty, I had to stop coming. I've come here least 50 times in the last 5 months and they constantly are not putting in tizekie sauce. The last time we came we picked up our to go order, asked are you sure they're sauce? they said yes we guarantee it we drove 40 minutes all the way home open up the bag and there's no sauce. We called the lady up at the front said there is no way there is no sauce in there and we were trying to get them for more sauce she had the nerve to say hold on I'll put you on the phone with the bagger he guarantees he put sauce in their. And I'm sitting here like what so finally 20 minutes on the phone and all of them were denying they didn't put the sauce in when they have cameras the point is when someone drives an hour round trip to get your food and you can't even throw in an extra sauce because they asked as their sauce and air is then they get home and there is no original sauce and air that is the worst feeling in the world and I'm never come back here ever even though they I'm super good food. The owner of this place is the cheapest bastard on Earth!! hes losing business and his workers are  lazy and then when people call the complain they say hold on we don't have a manager let me put the worker on the phone's the bags your meal wrong??

The Greek chicken salad is really good and filling, they also have soft serve ice cream, the prices are modestly priced for the portions they serve.</review>

< Review>
I love this place and have been coming for years.  The Gyros is as good as it gets and the chicken is really, really good.  The salads are also first rate.   Don't want bread?  Get the Gyros salad.  Even the small is a lot of food.  This is Gyros cut right from the spit...the only "real" Gyros!

Downside?  The Onion Rings are terrible.  I mean really bad.  Tasteless is the problem.  Obviously frozen and not fresh.  The Fries are ok.  Nothing to yell about, but ok.

Down and Dirty:  If you like GREEK...then stay with the Greek stuff on the menu.  Again, the Gyros is really first rate.  Expensive?  Yeh, I guess.  But, I've gotten Gyros in Plaza places that was cut, formed and had to be heated on the grill.

Oh, their yogurt sauce is spectacular if you are into that.

Best,</Review>

<text>food and service sucks they need better training and leadership the owners are not in the resturants anymore so everything has gone down to the drains and they go and open another one and raise their prices and put less on their plates they should not be in bussiness or at least the old man should be there like before. with out leadership there is no good bussiness done there.</text>< username>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) It's my first time eating at Greek Chicken, the kabobs I like so much I used to eat at a small family restaurant a long time ago in downtown Los Angeles, for our first time at Greek Chicken we ordered a Chicken Kabob comes with a skewer, rice , salad and pita. The flavor of the rice is very rich as well as that of the chicken and the salad was good. The deal with the client was excellent, both with the cashier and with the other employees, the prices are moderate, honestly I am left with a very good taste in my mouth and if I go back to keep trying more things from the Menu. Fully recommended🤙🏽.

El sabor del arroz es muy rico asi como el del pollo y la ensalada estuvo buena. El trato hacia el cliente fue excelente , tanto con la cajera como con los demas empleados, los precios son moderados ,sinceramente me quedo un muy buen sabor de boca y si vuelvo a regresar a seguir probando mas cosas del Menú. Totalmente recomendado🤙🏽.< /Review>
