Great food and service.
I went there with 2 other Colombian friends. We had a great time. The food was delicious and not very expensive. Besides food you will also find fruit juices and deserts.
If you are looking for Colombian food, this is the place to go!< /text>

Trust your eyes...this restaurant is very low budget. This interiors is old and the place is worn down. The best part of my meal was the chips (salsa was really bad) and beer. My tacos were greasy and messy. Very low quality. The service was good and the staff was friendly..<//review>

The services is horrible ... waiting in the table for 15 minutes while the place was almost empy, it was  just two busy tables. A few employees just looked at us from the distance and nothing happened. I didn't give the opportunity to try the food.<//Text>

I’ve passed by this spot so many times. I had lunch there many years ago when my company was headquartered down the street. But it’d been years. So today, I passed the lines at wonderful Luna and unique Zona Rosa, both on the Alameda in San Jose. I finally ventured in to this restaurant and was not disappointed. The young ladies serving are attentive and hard working. The dishes are obviously prepared with care and attention. It took a while to get my veggie burrito. In the mean time, the attentive young lady brought me a few chips and salsa. The salsa was ok for pouring over my burrito but lacked substance for the chips.
When the burrito arrived it was quite fresh and tasteful. For $6.99 it was well worth the wait. Next time I’ll try the margarita.<//text>

<Review>Overpriced and terrible quality food. The place is run down and can use a touch up not just another coat of paint ontop of the already old dust. $30 for 4 empanadas and 2 sodas. Are you wanting to go out of business? The place was empty at a rush hour lunch time. Should have been a sign. Stay away.<//Review><user>109394646630083833908</user>< Pics>

<Text>I ordered chicken enchiladas with green sauce. I got chicken with red sauce. I ordered it chimichanga style(fried) with flour tortillas. If they couldn't do it that way I said with corn tortillas. Needless to say I have soggy flour tortillas. The menu stated with sour cream.. There's no sour cream..  What's the deal? The restaurant wasn't that busy to make such huge mistakes. The last time I came here I ordered a $10 sangria thinking it had alcohol in it.. There wasn't any alcohol at all. A drink that size would have gone straight to my head...
With that being said... I won't bw going back to that place again.</Text>< GmapID>

<text>Chips weren’t super fresh but the salsa was good.
Service: it was a little slow but there was only 1 girl that was getting drinks, waiting, and cleaning tables. Considering she was all alone I think she did good.

Food: The quesadilla, the super taco, and the chili relleno were all really good. We were pleasantly surprised.<//text>< pics>

<review>Can't post a review about the food since we didn't try anything from the food menu. We were just there for a couple of drinks. Service wise was good only because of the two young ladies that were also assisting us. The other older server was super rude and made us feel uncomfortable or perhaps even unwelcome. Drinks are good but expensive. We got about six beers and the check was about $80.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

<Review>We came in for a late dinner. The waitress gave us a delicious sample of the soup. Everyone was courteous... but I had 2 margaritas, and my husband also had a drink. They were either severely watered down, OR no alcohol at all. I didn't eat any food, so if both margaritas had 2 shots of taquilla like the menu said they did, I would have had a great buzz on.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1502813301954, 'text': 'We sorry for you bad experience, i will talk to the staff and let me know if you try again the margaritas are in the house'}</Resp><gmap_id>0x808fcb728b9d7a1f:0xcdc2a4bdd19bc260</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>
<text>Very disappointed with this.  They apparently don't have a/c cuz when I got there the entrance door was propped open.  There were several fans going, but the thought of all those flies coming in was scary.  Sign said "Please seat yourself" so I did.  No one ever came with water or a menu!  Finally, maybe 20 minutes later, my companion arrived.  Menus finally came as we kept saying "I want to order."  There were 6 parties, none big, & 3 waitresses.  Deplorable service.  We both ordered the empanadas & sangria & asked for water.  Empanadas arrived, no sangria or water.  They appeared to be deep fried & were very dry.  When we were halfway thru, sangrias finally came.  Water never came.  Their prices are quite high, quality of food & service low, so I won't be back.  I frequent a few other Mexican restaurants--food & prices much better, so I'll continue to patronize them.</text>< Date>

Sad to say ...quality of food was poor the wet burrito was diced up steak mostly nerve from the meat...the 7 mares soup was not fresh you can tell the broth was greasy and probably fridge for a week.... and ugh no flavor...enchiladas suizas were not tastful it was bland and thick paste ,and the camarones a la diabla were made like a soup instead of a sauce,watery.... prices for these plates were 13.99 to 17.99 ...oh my goodness it seems like the ceiling falling apart ,the restaurant floor was dirty... bathroom doors were black wood painted doors the soap was watered down, literally no soap only water, our waitress was not attentive which sucks .I really expected better especially since its in a
Higher end of town... Im really surprised that they still have a license..GORDON RAMSEY from Hell's kitchen should pay them a visit...REALLY GHETTO...</review>

They had good chips and free water . They had bad service. The waitress  ignored  our family for 40 minutes. She took the orders of other people and left us hanging . Not a good place to eat very ×25000 horrible  services. Not a good place to recomend for a family or two person dinner . No bueno 😠😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😠😠😠😠😠😠. I am a mad mexican woman and this is not close to a real mexican restaurant.  Not even one bit. Ugh so not recomendable. Ush not good .ugh we only get one SMALL cup of water . They have no refills.  I was very thirsty but they didn't care to do any refills  of FREE WATER . Ugh no bueno.<//text>

<review>I'm going to be honest the first time I went I didn't like it probably because I just wasn't feeling it that day but I went on Mother's Day with my family &' the food was amazing. It did take a long to get our orders but bits because the owner of the restaurant actually makes the food, right in front of you, with someone helping him on the side so of course it will take a while for your food to come. It is a bit slow, the waitresses do take long but it's not a total rip-off. It's really worth the wait.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None</Resp><gmapID>0x808fcb728b9d7a1f:0xcdc2a4bdd19bc260</gmapID></record>

Didn't isn't hate it - didn't even eat there. Walked in and turned right around and walked out. $6.95 for 1 chili relleno - a la carte, just doesn't work for me - not even in Silicon Valley...</review>

Did not offer us the menu for Columbian food.
After we placed our order they came back like 20 minutes later to tell us they don’t have what we ordered. Also the food wasn’t even good. I tried the chilaquiles and they were the worst I’ve ever had. I Woulda had a better experience at McDonald’s.<//Text><pics>None<//pics><Rate>1<//Rate><UserId.>107969971500725371862<//UserId.><user_name>eliziel Cornejo< /user_name><resp>{'time': 1545000654604, 'text': '(Translated by Google) ???

Ordered a Margarita & a beer for my husband and I, went upstairs to use the restroom before we were about to order food, and lost my appetite. The women's restroom was gross as were the Gents.
And After experiencing this it spoke for the restaurants kitchen.
Perfect location wonderful staff disgusting to eat here<//review>

Pretty sure the worst Mexican food I've ever ate before,  paper thin carne asada,  salsa smells and taste next to vomit. Dishes came out 1 plate at a time, close to finish when tortillas fine showed up. Pass it up.< /Review>

Food was alright. There were 5 people in here and it took the waitress about 20 minutes to take our order for drinks and food. Probably another 30 minutes to get our drinks and 10 more for food. with only 5 people here, wow service sucks. Her 2 kids were also running around the whole place. Won't recommend this place to anyone.</review>

(Translated by Google) Very good place if you want to try Colombian food I recommend the paisa tray and the ajiaco; It would be good to add other dishes. But also super recommended

(Translated by Google) Colombian food is good, they have a large parking space to eat outdoors but they do not know how to take advantage of it, with the measures of the Cov-19 they must improve their sanitary measures and Noe I walk by the presentation of the menu.

<review>(Translated by Google) Mexican, it is a Colombian restaurant. The hotel is located next to the hotel, and it stayed here for about 5 days when we stayed. I sometimes heard Colombian live songs at night. There are many unusual dishes for Japanese people, so I can enjoy it so much. However, people from Latin America are predominantly the guests, so Oriental people may float a little.

(Original)
メキシカン、コロンビア料理屋です。隣にホテルが併設されており、ここに5日間程、泊まった際に利用しました。夜にたまにコロンビア系の方々の生歌が聴けました。料理は中々日本人には珍しいものが多々あり、そこそこ楽しめます。ただ、利用客は圧倒的に中南米の方々がメインなので、東洋人は少し浮くかもしれません。</review>< gmapID>

<Rating>1</Rating><review>Went to my appointment on the day that their computers weren’t working so they were doing first come first serve. Others who walked in after me were serviced faster. Definitely felt a misogynistic vibe as the guy helping us never spoke/even looked at me and only referenced my partner even though I was right there and it is my car. A simple appointment took forever. Chose this shop because of the great reviews and looked forward to finally finding a good mechanic in the area. Only way we would go again is if my partner takes *my* car without me for that “good” customer service.<//review>< pics>

<Text>Thank you Acutech for installing my Ultra Racing rear strut bar, I know it wasn't easy or simple, but you guys found a way to do it and it was excellent work.
I also love the custom 4 wheel alignment you made for my car, there is now very little to no understeer and the rear end rotates quicker and easier, my car now handles much more neutral in corners, so much more fun to drive than before.
I just add throttle after the apex and rear end rotates smoothly and predictably and just work the steering wheel to exit the corners.</Text>< pics>

Niki Tan and his staff are excellent! They are the best automotive mechanics I have ever worked with! They are thorough and caring. They keep you informed of the status of your vehicle and they let you know if your vehicle has other issues than the one you hired them to repair. I will never go anywhere else! Thank you Acutech!!< /text>

Acutech Autos is the best for tune-ups, all services,  body work, smog checks, etc.  Nicky the owner is the best, he is honest and reliable.  Ina the Receptionist is the best.  All the mechanics are great.  I've been going to  Acutech for over 10 years.  And I now live over 70 miles away and still take my car there.<//review>

I recently took my SUV to Accutech because it was having power problems when driving. They diagnosed the problem (cost $128.00) due to my alternator no longer working and a bad battery. They quoted me $599.00 for a new alternator and with a new battery and labor over $900.00 to fix my SUV. There was also no deduction for the $128.00 charged for the diagnoses. I was able to purchase a brand new alternator and battery for under $300.00 and had my son in law install it for me. I have taken both of my vehicles there for the past three years for numerous repairs and maintenance and could not believe they were trying to charge me$599.00 for an alternator, so much for being a loyal customer. I will be looking fo a new auto repair shop that will treat me fairly, doesn’t try to take advantage of me, and will appreciate my loyalty.</text>

I was disappointed with the service  this time for the following reasons:
1. First I was told that the rear tire can possibly be fixed, but later was told that I needed to pay for the new tire.
2. They ran bunch of expensive tests, for which I was charged, but they didn't fix the suspension, instead telling me that I need to take the car to a dealer and deal with Land Rover Company and try to get them agree to pay for the repair.
3. The car was in the shop for a week, but when I came to pick it up today the car and paperwork weren't ready and I had to wait about 45 minutes before getting it and leaving.
4. The car body was scratched on the rear passenger panel, and I had to point that out to the owner, who agree to take care of it, but said that I would need to bring it back again and leave there for a few days for body fixing and painting, which is terribly inconvenient for me and a big waist of time.< /Text>

< Review>
I took in my 2007 Nissan Murano because the dealership said I had both exhaust manifolds cracked and leaking. Niki and his team discovered that I really only needed one replaced and the other would be fine for a few more years. This saved me a lot of money and I never would have known the difference! I appreciate the honesty.

The other thing to mention was that they ran into some issues with the replacement because the old one was so beat up. Niki said it would take another day to complete, but I was going out of town with my family. He and one of his mechanics worked extra hard and got it done in time. Very good service!< /Review>

Great service, waits aren't too long, nice facility. The only problem is the lack of weekend hours. Being so close to so many neighborhoods, the lack of weekend hours makes it incredibly inconvenient to actually use. Please add weekend hours so I don't have to take time off just to see the doctor!<//Text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Text>My husband and I were extremely impressed with this facility. I went in on a Saturday morning. Friendly staff in the lobby area with a laptop greeted us. Urgent Care wasn't open yet but was told I could see a Doctor who had an opening in about 20 minutes. It was just as they said, 20 minutes. The doctor was fantastic, very professional and thorough. I would go there again.<//Text>< pics>

I had to take my son in last week and I can’t speak highly enough of the great service and treatment by everyone I encountered!
Did I have to wait? Sure I did, it’s a busy Urgent Care! But it was only about an hour and I can live with that, especially considering the care and kindness staff treated my son and I with!
My hats off to Mindi and Nurse Mike especially- they made an uncomfortable situation for my son, much easier to beat and were super respectful, caring, efficient and professional!<//review>

<Review>Went into Urgent Care knowing it would be a  long wait.  I registered and was told my appointment was going to be over the phone.  I was good with that and the phone appointment was prompt and just.  Got my Rx over the phone, walked back in picked it up and was on my way.  In and out within and hour and I could spend my time resting and getting better at home.  With this harsh flu season, this was at good idea on part of Kaiser to bring down the wait time.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

That was by far the worst experience I've had at any medical facility ever. I waited over 2 1/2 hours to be seen for a dislocated shoulder. Doctor walks in and was more interested in small talk than my injury, less than 2 minutes after she walked in she walked out before I could even ask a few questions. Apparently this is just a job for these folks... no actual care involved. smh</text>

I went to Urgent Care with a rib injury that left me in 9/10 pain. I was so very discouraged with the wait time. I waited three and a half hours to even see a doctor. I know one of Kaisers goals has always been to provide "Customer satisfaction" they really missed the mark !!< /Text>

<Review>Whoever designed this facility has never worked in this environment. There is no thought to proper flow. Nurses from Urgent Care had to go hunt down patients because the waiting area is so tiny. Bathrooms are way off in the far corner and not clearly marked. Worst is that you have to check in with the main receptionist for every thing that needs to be done. Dr. orders labs and X-ray? Go check in again, then wait. Each time, there were at least 30 people in that line. Ridiculously inefficient. Four kiosks in the lobby but can't be used for anything but to check in for a doctor's appointment (not labs or anything else).

Oh... and the design? Some of it is okay, but most of it is ghastly.  The "Kaiser green" is not a soothing, calming color. Overall, unimpressed.</Review></record></dataset><record>

Nice looking facility, but it pretty much ends there. It is unconscionable that they would design a health care facility where disabled patients have to walk outside so far to get to the check in area. Even disabled persons have to park away from the building across the street, and there are no wheelchairs available close by. In the summer, it is a very long walk in the blazing sun, and in the winter, if it's raining, a long walk without cover so you get wet.
Once inside, only one check in area for all departments, and a very large waiting room for everyone. In my case, the lab person didn't come out to the waiting room to call for patients, but called from inside the lab where no one could hear her, so instead, people just walked in to see if they could get their blood drawn. Very unorganized.
I wish they would extend the hours for the lab and pharmacy at the Wildomar facility back to where they were before they reduced them after they opened the Murrieta facility.
Bottom line, they did Kaiser members a disservice when they opened this poorly designed facilty.< /Text>

< Review>
Had an urgent issue was booked opening day, building great, staff helpful, check in kiosk fine, offices unmarked, was confusing, maybe signage was being added later, had to wait for my name on the display monitor for which dept. in the "public area", didn't like that everyone could see my name really, although I did not notice the office discription or dept. just the number of the dept. Standing around with everyone seemed to me to not be a good idea if you were ill. Alot of signing on the doctors laptop that looked like an Etch a Sketch signature,  repeated many times in the room until I got it right, it was nice to see my records on the screen, but not necessary during my visit really. Mistake was made of my future appt., Kaiser quickly handled it on the day and my procedure was done after all which was awesome! Beware newby's its different and awkward at first visit but am sure it will get to be smoother soon!</Review>

<text>(Translated by Google) I took my son this morning to the emergency room they gave him an injection that after the injection the pain he was bringing was immediately stronger my son told the nurse that it hurt more after the injection and she told him that everything was not possible This comes that he could go, we went to the pharmacy, we ordered the medicine that had been prescribed for him and the pain continued to get worse, so the pharmacist told us that the injection had been very high and that it was possible that he had pricked a nerve, which was what that caused the pain, his whole arm felt very cold (we will not return to this place)

(Original)
Llevé a mi hijo esta mañana a urgencias le administraron una inyección que después de la inyección el dolor que traía se hizo más fuerte inmediatamente mi hijo le dijo a la enfermera que le dolía más después de la inyección y ella le dijo que no era posible todo esto viene que se podía ir fuimos a la farmacia ordenamos la medicina que le habían recetado y el dolor le seguía peor entonces el farmacéutico nos dijo que la inyección se la había puesto muy arriba y que era posible que él hubiera picado un nervio que fue lo que le ocasionó el dolor todo el brazo lo sintiera bien frío ( no volvemos a este lugar )</text><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

Ive lived in Lake Forest for 40 years and frequently ordered sandwiches from this location over the decades. But never before have I been so rudely treated by one of their employee's. I walk in to pick up my online order and stopped at the orange marks as the signs direct. I see the sign at the cash register and it says to stay at the orange mark until the cashier calls on you. So the guy behind the counter says how can I help you, I tell him I am picking up an online order as I step forward. He tells me to step back to the orange mark before I can even finish what im saying. The sign clearly states to stay there until called upon. Maybe you should get your act together with these signs before you start berating customers for following your own rules.< /review>

Anyway food is awesome! Service not that great. The inside is an average deli type feel. Nothing really inviting about it. But it's cool. Would recommend for sure!<//text>< GmapID>

My mom, brother and I decided to get a quick bite on Sat 11/9/19 while my other brother was in the hospital next door having a quick surgery. The lady who took and filled our orders was very rude. The guy who was there was awesome! I believe that his name was Martine or Martin. He went above and beyond to make sure that we had excellent service. He even looked at the lady a couple of times like what are you doing...he didn't say anything to her though. I give her 1 star and I give him 5 so the average is 3. Oh and the restaurant is very clean, the bathroom was extremely clean and well stocked and the sandwiches were fresh. So besides her rude attitude and service, we had a great experience.<//review>

Amazing sandwiches. The Godfather is their signature, with homemade bread, capocollo, mortadella, prosciutto, ham, salami and provolone. It's truly outstanding, one of the four or five best sandwiches I've had in Los Angeles,CA.</text>

<Review>On Thursday February 19 @ 145        p.m.
I was thirsty decided to give this establishment a try,  placed my order attempted to pay my bill, the female counter person accepted my $100.00 bill immediately etly retreated to a rear room, only to emerge

Demanding that the bill I presented was counterfeit, I challenged her demanding that she return the bill, she refused and threatened to call the police, I countered her and call the police.  At this moment she relented and the

return
The bill.  The question now how
do I know if she returned my original bill or a counterfeit bill.

After all why did she disappear into a different room out of the view of every one.

So beware if you go to this establishment there is a possibility, this scam may be perpetuated on you.</Review><pictures>None</pictures><rating>1<//rating>< Date>

<Text>I've probably eaten a few hundred of these sandwiches at this point and I still find myself coming back. The bread is top notch, ingredients are fresh, Rafael cares and it shows. The guys he has working the registers always greet you and send you off with a smile. Bread is made in house. Awesome spot. Killing the game right now my dudes.< /Text>< pictures>

Food for hospital visitors, so it did not disappoint. Tasted fresh, way better than most sandwich chain experiences, and good value for amount of food. The staff was also very attentive and kind, two ladies. I would go again if I was in need of a sandwich, haha.<//text>

Tasty sandwiches made to order. Staff was friendly, but they'd run out of some ingredients when I was there.

Don't expect to find street parking during the day. Parking garage across the street will cost about $5 while you wait for your order, and there's about 8 flights of stairs -- I didn't see an elevator.</Review>

This is a welcome place for Downtown. The staff was friendly and its clean but small. Careful about parking there. The entrance is on Wilshire but DO NOT GO STRAIGHT. Go to the right into the residential entrance to the right. If you go straight, it goes into the medical building and it'll cost you about $6. The hours of this Togos is also not your typical hours. They don't stay open late.<//Text>

Riley Dental has been my dentist for over a decade. I’m always well pleased with their services. The staff of doctors and dental assistants are very friendly and very knowledgeable. I learn something new each time I get my teeth cleaned because they take the time to explain health related issues of proper mouth hygiene & maintenance. I look forward to every visit. The dental assistant I frequent knows me inside and out & always makes me feel like part of her family. I love the atmosphere and the professionalism.<//Review>

I was a a bit nervous about switching to a new dentist this summer, as I've been going to the same dentist for 20 years. Boy! I was more than pleasently surprised and satisfied with my very first experience at Riley. I have difficult teeth to maintain and the pandemic had made it even harder for me. Rona Cepello was the most amazing dental hygienist that I have ever had. From the beginning to the end of my appointment, she was professional, knowledgeable, informative and thorough. Quite frankly, my teeth, just after this one visit to Riley's dental hygienist, looked better & whiter, as well as, felt better & healthier than 20 years of going to my previous dentist! I can't say more how pleased I am about Riley & esp. this first appointment with Rona. In general the entire staff is super friendly and concerned about your dental care. I can say, without a doubt, that I am happy-happy that I made the switch. Thank you Rona for making me completely happy with my decision and keeping me confident while I smile! Is it possible to WANT to visit your dentist and dental hygienist!?! I wouldn't believe it ... but yes! Riley is the place! Ask for Rona if you are getting a deep cleaning! Thanks all!<//text>

My experience was wonderful. Not afraid to say this but I'd rather be in a pit of rattle snakes covered with mice than go to a dentist for any reason but Riley dental group staff are the friendliest people. 5 stars and 2 big thumbs up 👍</review>

My 14 year old daughter needed to see a new dentist and we decided to take her to Riley Dental she was a little nervous. The staff and her new dentist where really friendly and helpfull that she felt comfortable. Also she got her teeth clean and her dental hygienist was amazing she gave my daughter lots of pro tips on how to keep her gums and teeth healthy. My daughter came out happy I would highly recommend.</text>

My dental hygienist was the best, Rona. My last deep cleaning was that of a medieval experience. My opinion of the dental profession has turned into a positive. I received very caring and professional service. I am going to recommend Riley Dental to all my family and friends. Riley Dental was recommended by one of your loyal patients of 27 years. Keep up the good work. 👍😁👍</text>

I came here due to a horrible tooth ache, was very anxious and on extreme pain but everyone starting from the front office to the back office were kind, friendly and I could see that they care about their patients. They are all very knowledgeable at what they do but Dr Ryan L. Wong is amazing, caring and great at what he does. His dental assistant is so kind and caring (sorry forgot her name).  They brought my anxiety level way down. I will definitely recommend this office to family and friends 100%.</Review>

I am ashamed to say its been too long since my last dental visit.  I am a first time patient at Riley Dental and have nothing but good things to say.  At first I was a little hesitant because taking x-rays can be so scary and they take like 20+! I was so nervous but Kiara (I believe that is her name) was so nice and reassuring.  Now I am proud to say that X-rays aren't so bad!  All in all I had a great experience and staff was super friendly and took time to educate me on preferred oral care techniques while getting my teeth cleaned.  Would recommend!<//Review>

I was nervous about going to Dentist but Riley Dental made me feel so comfortable everyone is so nice my Doctor took care me very well. This is a great place to go take care of your teeth. The team was very professional examining and providing with solutions by priority. I had to do periodontal root cleaning and (DN) did a great job, I felt that I was in good hands. All the people here were very gentle and kind to me. They explained very well what was going on. courteous, and friendly staff made me feel like family… would highly recommend to anyone. :)<//Review>

Horrible customer service when it comes to billing.  Today Denise explained they “bill your insurance as a courtesy!” Well I’m saving the inconvenience, switching to a dental office who actually cares about their patients enough to be truly courteous to them!

In response to Riley’s response:

There is a courteous way to clarify a misunderstanding, and a not so courteous way of clarifying.  Denise was immediately rude without understanding my concern or the situation or even asking how she could clarify. I’m not the first person to have an issue with your office team’s lack of response - I believe you’re pretty aware of that. Perhaps some additional information would help provide a better picture.  I contacted the office not one, but twice to ask for clarification after receiving letters from my insurance.  Both times I was told “we will research and get back to you” yet I did not receive a call back either time.  I did however receive a bill without the courtesy of a call to provide an explanation for the bill.  I find that to be a lack of good customer service.  In addition, before having Denise come over to explain the process to me, (very rudely, I might add) I asked if there was anything we could do to verify my coverage before we started the procedure.  The employee who was helping went to seek clarification and Denise was the one who returned with an immediate attitude as if I was asking for something out of the ordinary.  Quite frankly, there is no explanation for rudeness and lack of customer service.  If that’s the type of courtesy you extend your patients, I’ll remove myself off your customer list as will the rest of my family and friends all of whom have also not had great experiences.  Thank you for extending your courtesies of submitting my claim, it’s oh so kind of you, but I’ll spare you any more troubles.</Text>

I started coming here a few years ago as I recommended by my previous dentist whose own dentist was at Riley. I love coming in for my six month cleanings to catch up with Marge and the whole staff is open about cost, always able to schedule me easily and so nice! Love this place. Worth the drive from Pasadena!< /Review>

I can’t express enough how I’ve finally found my dental home for my family and I. We always have a great experience when going in for cleanings or dental work. It’s a clean and cozy office with welcoming staff, especially the young lady in the front named Ashley. If you’re looking for a family friendly environment and great dental service, you’ll find it at Riley Dental.

I highly recommend their Hygienist Loreli.<//text>

If you end up on his dental chair you know that you definitely are in good hands. He is a great specialist and makes sure that you don't feel any pain during the procedure. I hate the moments of getting a numbing shot, but he does it painlessly. He will explain to you everything step by step, answers all your questions, and makes you feel not like his patient, but rather like his friend that he really cares about. After my dentist retired, my friend recommended this office to me and after reading recommendations I decided to try it. It was a good decision that I am very happy with. The whole staff is very friendly and professional. What is also very important -  the whole office is spotless.</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< username>

Literally the NICEST dental office I've ever been to. The environment is so clean and aesthetic. Everyone was super sweet and nice. My periodontist was very informative and made me feel super comfortable. I have only had one visit so far but will def be going back to get whatever work I need done. I HIGHLY recommend this dental practice to anyone who is local to the area.<//text>

From the very kind and caring personnel at front desk to Dr. Huh and all assistants, I have never been to a dental office that is so professional and truly cares about their patients.

Dr Huh is an amazing Dentist and being treated by her makes my phobia of Dentists pleasing, relaxing and least of my worries. She is a true professional

Thank you all once again and Happy Holidays

Efficient, timely, professional, clear explanations of dental situations. I've used this dentist office for nearly forty years, and a new generation of people now provide services. I don't yet know what I think, and I couldn't give it a 4.5 stars. It's not a four star, but I don't think it was a five star either. It's so hard to know, so I have to accept on faith that what I was told about my dental needs is factual. Time will tell. I will continue to use Riley Dental; I've been quite satisfied with their services, and they've treated me well dentally and monetarily since we do not have dental insurance.< /Text>

<text>Great dental group. I have been a patient for over 10 years, my husband for over 30 years. My young children are patients too. Everyone from the dentists, the hygienists and front office staff are so personable. They take a vested interest in the lives of their patients outside the dental office and they do a phenomenal job of taking care of your dental needs. It's like a family that you enjoy visiting twice a year! It also says alot that we drive an hour to continue our care at Riley Dental Group. Hands down the best in customer service and patient care!< /text><pics>None< /pics><Resp>{'time': 1603478017255, 'text': 'Oh my gosh! What a wonderful review. Thank You so much sweetenergy!

Their customer service is excellent in the front desk and with the dentists, and their assistants. All their staff is great. I love it so much. I am glad I was able to find them. They actually heard me and accommodated their service to my need.

It is a veru different experience to other dentist groups, I went to have a consultation.</text>

I'm almost 40 and have been coming here since I've had teeth! My family and I have always had superior care and wonderful service; they are like family. I've never understood people's fear of the dentist bc I've never experienced it. They always take really good care of me and take the time to thoroughly explain all the procedures and my benefits regarding what is and what's not covered. Would highly recommend them to everybody.</Text>

<Text>The biggest scammers and lack of ethics I have ever seen. I was told by dentist Hell I mean Huh , that I needed all my fillings  removed . and redone  . A couple where less then a year old . A wolf in sheep's clothing and that's putting it mildly . Regret giving this place a second chance . I live nearby,  I like giving local places my businesses. But stay far away from these thieves.</Text>< Pics>

Everybody is so kind and professional.  I've been coming to Dr. Shimizu for years,  off and on. I understand he's retiring. How is he being allowed to do this? He still looks 35! Well done. God bless.

I was treated by Dr. Huh this morning.  She was incredibly professional throughout my visit. I cracked a tooth. Options were discussed, w a tx plan agreed to.

Thank you to the front desk staff for expediting my appointment so quickly!

Lifesavers. All of you.<//text>

It went very well. The hygienist was very professional and very helpful with info. I had been neglectful the last few years because of personal unfortunate happenings, and she was encouraging in how I could change things with more attentive personal care. Have always been blessed there with Riley’s dental!</Review>

Excellent quality, caring cheerful service, professional office operations.  I've been going to Riley Dental Group for about 30 years. During that time I moved to Santa Clarita, which is further away from San Fernando where Riley's office is located.  Yet I still drive to San Fernando for their outstanding dental care.
I just had my teeth cleaned by Carieanne.  She was gentle, through, informative, sweet, and encouraging.  I highly recommend her.  My wife and her sister both go to Riley's for cleanings and they both boast of their hygienist.  It seems the office has a solid staff of excellent people.
A couple of years ago Dr. Patricia Huh replaced Dr. Riley.  She has been spectacular.  During examinations Dr. Huh is careful to clarify the status of my teeth and gums helping me to appreciate where problems are developing so I can pay attention to those areas, and so I am not surprised if treatment is required a year or later. Riley's office has never suggested treatment that was not justified, and everything they fixed has stayed fixed.
Be sure to arrive at your appointment on time because they are ready and waiting. There is no wasted time in the waiting room.  They have a small parking lot in the back, so you don't have to look for street parking.
Go to Riley's once and you'll go the rest of your life.</Text>

This was definitely one of my better experiences at the dentist. Everyone’s so helpful and nice. They went over and beyond to get my insurance to cover a broken filling. Dr. Yu is wonderful. She helped me feel comfortable and worked with me on special circumstances I have. I felt nothing and she got the job done. I would recommend highly!< /review>

This is a hidden gem in the city of San Fernando.
Great location, easy to park, the facility has a clean old fashion feel about it making it warm and inviting.Every member of the staff from the front office,x-rays to the operating chair made it a very pleasant experience!! Very well kept and clean too. I must admit, my experience was relaxing and enjoyable. No I'm not mistaking, this was a dentist appointment for crowns and cavities. Don't want confuse anyone.
Thank you Soo much Riley dental team, I'll be a client of yours till the wheels fall off, I mean teeth, correction THEY WONT LET THAT HAPPEN!!LOL...who ever reads this, Merry Christmas and Happy New year's!!< /Text>

<Text>This place is super clean and efficient.

They have never made a recommendation for work that was not needed.

The staff is friendly.<//Text><username>Salvador Gallegos</username>< user>

Have been with Rileys Dental over 1 yr.  This was my 1st visit since covid19. I was thoroughly impressed with the safely measures in place for patient safety as well as for staff, which definitely put me at ease. Great staff,  technicians, Dentist etc. I have a few of my very own favorites but will let you decide for yourself. I will continue to recommend Rileys Dental.<//Review>

< review>
Al & Sons is amazing! My 2003 Toyota Camry was in such bad shape. Johnny got my car in the very next day and got the car running better then its ever been. It feels like a brand new car. I'm over the moon extatic over the outcome of how much better my old car runs. I have so many more yrs left with this car after having it seen at their shop. I cant thank them enough for what they have done! I highly recommend them to anyone who has had bad experiences at other mechanic shops. Your fears and worries come to an end once you bring your vehicles to AL & Sons. Thanks again guys for making this experience a joyful one!</review>

<Review>Fantastic service ... I recommend this shop 100% on honesty, good service, knowledgeable experts on all phases of car repairs, and good prices.   You drive away with peace of mind that your car was in good hands. Go on, give them a try.</Review>< Pictures>

< Review>
Took our car in to get the full work up before moving, 2 days in we are stranded with a trailer in New Mexico due to an old fuel pump (easy fix). Thanks guys!< /Review>
<Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>{'time': 1603294328111, 'text': "Hi Peter, thank you for choosing AL & Son's. We are very sorry that your fuel pump went out 2 days into your move out of the state. However, we would like to point out that nobody can predict when a fuel pump or any other electronic component in your car will fail. We did a full and complete inspection of the vehicle and recommended several things to you and your daughter that needed to be done before such a long trip. Again we are very sorry your fuel pump failed but, we feel your review and one star rating is unfair. We wish you good luck in your move and in the future."}</Response>< gmapID>

I have been Going to AL & Sons for well over 5 years now. My go to mechanic. Great customer service. Family owned small business that still operates thinking of the customer. Ask for Johnny, he is the 3rd generation working in the family business. My father came here and now I do. They will not take advantage of their customers. They do not up-sell.  They are straight shooters. They tell you what needs to be fixed and what they recommend you should do. Then you can take it from their. They will even work with your financial scheduled. Say fix one thing this pay check and get to the other next pay check. Great!!! most shops will not help you out. Al & Sons will! I can not say enough about them. I go here for everything. A bad Break Light, Oil-change, Brakes, Tun-ups and more. Best of all If you live in the area they will even give you a ride home and pick you up when your car is ready. WHO DOES THAT! Again Amazing service, good people, good work, and good prices. Go to Al & Sons.< /Review>

Courtesy, integrity, honesty, knowledge and efficiency......

Truck with 110,000 miles..
I didn't remember (I'm old), if I had a tune up previously....they pulled a plug and told me I was fine.....honest..

I've been moaning to mechanics for a few years about my odometer blinking continuously 🤪

Several highly recommend mechanics told me that I would have to live with it... cluster.... even though I had the cluster replaced a few years ago....

Johnny didn't even mention it as I left...

They fixed it 😃
Highly recommend...< /Text>

Johnny has always been straight forward and honest, Always tells me what needs to be fixed as well as accurate estimate on prices as well as any upcoming parts and services needed. If you take your car or truck anywhere else then you will be wasting your money and time having to get the same parts and repair done earlier then you should have and offer good warranties on there parts they order and the work they do. I  recommend everyone to stop by anytime you have any issues or problems with vehicle.<//Text>

e all know when it comes to someone working on our cars...its hard to know if they are really telling you the truth. I've been to places that have told me I need thousands of dollars of work done to my car and in actual reality I didn't. A friend referred me Al and Sons because my brakes were squeaking horribly. I called them first to tell them what was going on I spoke with Johnny. He was very informative and explained to me a couple if different scenarios it could be. I felt right at ease and decided to take my car in there that same day. They were very professional and were able to find the problem right away. Not only did they fix my brakes, they also replaced a broken vacuum lune and turned off my check engine light at no charge. I would highly recommend this place to anyone that needs work done on their car! Genuine, knowledgeable and trustworthy all of them are. Thanks Johnny and Roger for your tremendous help!</text>

<Text>I bring all my personal and company vehicles to Johnny and the guys and have for some time. It's hard nowadays to find a good honest mechanic , but the guys over there have always taken great care of me, my family, my company, and anyone I've referred  to him. They aren't the biggest fan of my work van that has a diesel motor stuffed into it , but they take care of it with no issues. They Explain what to fix, and tell me to not dump money into a money pit and just look into getting a newer vehicle when it makes more sense. Al & sons are guys you can trust.< /Text><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

I can honestly say that if you are looking for a reasonable, trustworthy shop that takes pride in their work and customer satisfaction then look no further. Al & Sons Automotive is a top notch automotive repair facility that will treat you fair and most importantly honestly!!! I have personally had my vehicles serviced and repaired at their garage for over 15 years and would still be going to them if I didn't move out of state. Hard working mechanics, and great ownership work hand in hand in this shop to make it one of the very best in the area. And as most of you know, honest repair shop are difficult to find these days, don't hesitate to give them a shot. I assure you, you will not be dissapointed .< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None<//Response>< Gmap_id>

Have been coming to this shop for at least 20+ years and it’s the only shop I have ever trusted my cars and motor home too. You are treated like family and they are the most trustworthy group of guys who really care about you and making sure your automative needs are taking care of. Won’t try and upsale you in anyway and really take care of the problem with your car. Highly recommend them to take care of all your automotive needs! Thanks Johnny and the guys for always being there for me!!!< /review>

<text>Quick and accurate service with exceptional part access. Right off of Arlington. There's a waiting area inside with plenty of space to distance. TV to pass the time. If there's something you're looking for, don't hesitate to give a call and ask. Got a Borla S-type exhaust on the 2020 Raptor today and it sounds terrific. Great job guys 👍< /text>< Resp>

<review>This place has it all, and they don’t try to up sell you. They try to get you what you need for your lifestyle/recreation. I’ve had a pleasant experience with each visit. They gave me a good price on my wheels, bumpers, shocks and all the little accessories too. I’ll never go anywhere else.<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None< /Response><GmapID>0x80dcb6ccbd1fa9d9:0xa3cb68ac0ec89508< /GmapID></record>

<Review>Very satisfied with the work Javier and his crew at Accessories Unlimited have done. Most of the time when I come into this place I see people bringing in their 60 to 80 thousand dollar trucks asking for 6 to12in. lifts with some 37's and up size tires. Well friends, if your one of these guys then I'm sure your gonna pay for quality type work and that is what Accessories Unlimited provide. Not only are they fair in price but there is a reason why people bring in there high end toys to this place. And not to mention the professionalism that Javier brings to this place is second to none. He will take the time to explain what work needs to be done and why. I find myself getting a little bit jealous sometimes because he spends a lot of time with each customer to ensure and fully explain what needs to be done first and what could wait.
Very happy to spend my time and money here cause I know I'll get great quality work and great quality service, thanks Accessories Unlimited.<//Review><pics>None<//pics><Response>None</Response>< gmap_id>

I had my 2018 Ram 1500 lifted today by Javier and Caesar. A 7" lift with 37" tires on 20x12 rims. My truck turned out exactly how I envisioned it to look, it now rides better than stock and looks great.

Javier the shop owner proved how passionate he is about working on trucks.

I called him and spoke to him on the phone back in December, we kept in touch and I even went to his shop where he took all the time in the world to explain to me what he would be doing, showed me different setups, wheels and tires.

I again went to his shop one last time this past Monday, he spent almost an hour with me personally going through tires, wheels and what to expect. He set up and ordered all he parts needed for my truck and today he had it all done, installed and ready to go.

Javier, thank you so much, You and Caesar really did a great job, I will definitely recommend you guys to others, I have no complaints whatsoever, I am really happy with the way my truck looks now!

If you are looking to get your truck lifted or you need wheels and tires, Javier is he right person to go to, you "WILL NOT" be disappointed.

I will post more pictures when I clean my truck tomorrow!<//review>

Great prices and great service two things you don't usually get at one shop but here you get both! Got a bakflip tonneau cover for my 2019 Tacoma the price was the best in riverside and they had it installed in 45 minutes! Will definitely come here for all my truck needs!</text>

This is a very formidable shop who will give any other accessory shop a run for their money because of their A-1 inventory and customer service. They will treat your car as their very own.</Review><Rate>5<//Rate></record></dataset><record>

Javier and his staff are very knowledgeable and helpful. They carry the best products available and do great work. I’ve used them to lift my Ram 1500 and do rear air suspension for towing on my Ram 3500. I will continue to return to them for anything I do to my vehicles<//review>

I found this shop by reading the reviews and calling around several other shops to compare. Javier and accessories unlimited have exceeded all expectations on price, quality of installation and most importantly service. I originally reached out to this shop to get a tonneau cover and steps installed. They treated me so well I have exclusively used them for all of my customization needs. I have had tires, wheels, lift, LED install, stereo installed, etc. Any issue that came up Javier took care of it without batting an eye, no other shop would have treated me like he did. I highly recommend this shop for all of your truck needs, thanks accessories unlimited!</text>

If you ever need any advice or suggestions about any upgrades on your truck or Jeep this is the one spot you want to stop by. Their experience speaks for itself. Haven’t found a shop that’s honest, reliable, and clean. All the work they’ve done to my truck from suspension to rims and tires and lighting haven’t had no issues whatsoever and I’ll keep going back for more upgrades. Ask for Javi, all the people I’ve referred him to has left happy either with his work or honest opinion to any questions you have!🙏🏻👍🏻<//text>

<review>Had been going back and forth regarding a truck cover. Quality is a must at a decent price. Was guaranteed next day delivery from day of order which it was and was able to get it put on as soon as it came in. Had an issue with position but brought it right back and Javier was very attentive and took care of it immediately! All in all good experience. Plan on going back for a leveling kit next. Thanks again for a great experience!<//review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

<Review>Great customer service!  Excellent work.  I bought some accessories from here and when I had an issue with it even after my warranty had expired, they helped me resolve the issue.  Also talked me out spending on unnecessary parts when I thought I had a bigger issue with my Jeep.  They looked at it, told me what was wrong and advised me not to waste money on the parts I wanted to get.  They were able to resolve my issue at a very minimal cost.  They have definitely earned my loyalty and future business.  Thank you so much for all your help!< /Review>< pics>

Recently purchased 2018 jeep wrangler JL.
I was looking for a shop to have my jeep lifted and have bigger tires. I Shopped around  multiple shops and I'm so glad I've found accessories unlimited.  The price is very affordable and reasonable.  The worksmenship is exceptional and top quality. Javier is very knowledgable and an honest guy.
I highly recommend this shop and will definitely return to have more work done.
Many thanks javier< /review>

I drove by this place a thousand times and never noticed it. Do yourself a favor and stop by this place. The guys there are very professional  and have a humbleness about them. Some people are very arrogant that deal in this industry and talk down to you at times... NOT TRUE FOR THESE GUYS This is now my "go to" for all my car toys! .lol</text>

<Text>Very worn out looking store. They only work on Jeeps and nothing else according to the guy behind the counter. The website information is completely false. It shows all types of vehicles that have been customized by the shop. Take them off the site. Call 1st and hope someone answers to get the "low-down".< /Text><rating>1< /rating><gmapID>0x80dcb6ccbd1fa9d9:0xa3cb68ac0ec89508< /gmapID>< UserId.>

<text>On arrival, I was greeted by Gretchen, the evening front desk worker.  She was so friendly and welcoming.  She explained how breakfast snack bag was available each morning,etcetera.  Gretchen greeted me by name during my entire stay.  That doesn’t usually happen at most hotels.  

My room was clean and the bed was a welcome sight after a long day.  I appreciated the efforts of the staff.  

My visit to California was an emotional one, as my mother has dementia and I had not been able to visit for over a year.  It was nice to be greeted each evening with a smile at the hotel.</text><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None</Response>< GmapID>

Upon arrival we were told there was no room service unless staying 5 or more days. Pool was closed (which we already knew) but no housekeeping we weren’t aware and were staying with a 2 yr old. Went to make dinner for the toddler and the microwave plate didn’t fit properly in the microwave causing the food to go everywhere. Went to take shower and the bathtub filled up with water, drain plug wouldn’t work to release water. Called front desk and was told they would check with another room how to work drain release. Later told that they would have maintenance fix it the next day. Next day went to take showers and no maintenance still no drainage and front desk said maintenance wouldn’t be in until 3 pm. They offered to change our room in about an hour. No offer of reimbursement for the night before which would have been what I would expect plus moving to a different room. Take out breakfast was brown paper bag with an orange a water and a granola bar. I chose this hotel after debating on another close by that was cheaper because we stayed before with a 1 yr old and had fabulous service and accommodations. I won’t be using this hotel again.<//review>

Dirty stained sheets.  I hope stained and not unwashed. Nasty.
Charged for a day I didn't reserve. I reserved mon-tues
They charged for Sunday. While checking in. A previous guest came in complaining of same thing and stated it was the third time coming back for same mistake. Must speak to manager who's never in. Always just left she said. The parking lot is empty. Is this how they are making up for revenue?<//review>

I'm currently here. They do take your temperature and your credit card must match your name here. The doors are only accessible if you already have your room key. You must pick up a phone to check in and then you can go through the process to get into your room. You must wear a mask and be courteous. The businesses are trying to operate at a full level and many already have opened. Just do what you can to make your experience easier. As part of my job that is what I'm supposed to do. God bless, take care, stay safe and enjoy your stay here. 😊< /Text>

The experience was fine. Room was clean, front desk nice and professional. What bothered me was I paid the money for the room on this web sight but when I got to the hotel, I had to pay another $250 deposit which had to be on a card and took 5 days to get back. I spent $423 to sleep a few hours. Won't do that again.< /Text>

The check in staff I dealt with was curt, rude to my children for no reason, the A/C/Heater cover in our room was broken, and the decor/ambiance and thus comfort level...well...there wasn’t any decor. Very plain, bland room. For the price, I would expect it to be far better maintained and comfortable.<//Text>

<review>The room was clean but the shower pressure was real bad-even changing the shower head made no difference also the water was lukewarm could not turn knob to get hotter water. The smoke detector was covered with a plastic bag so not sure how it could detect smoke...?  Brought that to the attention of the front desk.<//review>< Pictures>

<Review>Positive: I had an amazing experience. It was quiet. The staff was excellent, very accommodating. The room was phenomenal. I will definitely recommend this hotel to others. And I would love to stay there again. Negative: I am only upset that I couldn't use the facilities, but that is due to covid19.  It has nothing to do with the hotel at all.< /Review>< pics>

<Review>The purpose of this 2-night stay was to have a relaxing weekend with my husband.  I booked a jacuzzi suite in anticipation that we could both enjoy the jacuzzi TOGETHER.  Of course when we entered the room the first thing we wanted to see was the JACUZZI.  Imagine our surprise when what we found was a triangular shaped tub smaller than our home bathtub.  There was no possible chance that we were both going to fit in that tub.  I asked the front desk if all the tubs in the jacuzzi suites were this size.  She said yes.  I then explained to her that my husband and I are not going to be able to fit in the tub together and that was the purpose of booking this room.  She responded with, "the two of you should fit."  I chuckled and said, "okay, we'll try it out".  Whelp, we tried it.  We crammed our average size bodies into this jacuzzi.  Needless to say, it was not the experience I planned for us.  Our two-night stay was cut short.  We checked out that next morning and decided to go back home.  I probably will not book at this hotel again.< /Review>< user_id>

I was disappointed with breakfast controlled limits. I was told I could only have “one” bagged breakfast... coffee kits are provided at the front desk and not in the room and very inconvenient  since I had to get dressed at 6:30 am to go downstairs.  This has been the only hotel with these rules... Clerk explained these practices are due to COVID 19 safety guidelines... really?  These restrictions are not in anyway covid 19 protection guidelines... more controlling and cheap practices! 

The following day I stayed at another IHG hotel and they had a fabulous breakfast spread and choices!< /Review>

<Text>Guest services The place seemed very unclean the phone using to get in was not very sanitized at all. A sack they provided to you in the morning with the water and an orange the lady that brought it out did not have gloves on provided any hand sanitizer after she went back to the back to pick them up. No room service was provided at all if you wanted anything you had to go to the front and ask for it coffee towels. The room was not clean or sanitized found leftover clothes from the last person there the shower had hair in the bottom and the countertops Head greasy fingerprints.

<review>We were traveling to California because I was transfered for my job. We had just driven 14 hours nonstop. We knew we had to stop and rest. I requested a ground floor room for my wife. She has difficulty moving around. We were both very comfortable with room. Because of the Virus we were not allowed to have breakfast. That was a major let down even though we understood still a big disappointment.< /review>< Pictures>

Customer service was great and so was the other customers. The beds and pillows were comfortable and clean. The room got dark enough to sleep in and relax without the heat coming in. Air conditioning worked perfect. The bathroom was perfect sized and the shampoo, conditioner and body wash was great, not like the cheap kind at most hotels.<//Text>

During the COVID-19 other Holiday Inn Express provided a list of items for guests to choose, which much better than to-go bag with only three items, plus had to ask front desk for a sandwich.
The traffic noise was noticeable.< /Review>

Horrible customer service! Remodeling inside, noisy, pool closed, breakfast buffet closed. Staff are rude. They gave out "breakfast bags" that consisted of 1 water bottle and 1 granola bar. Come on! Thats not what the website said. I stayed with family and 2 children. No extra towels or blankets. Never again!</text>

Nice rooms, but the short white lady st the front desk was so rude and has absolutely no people skills. They give you a coffee pod with a cup. I always stay at holiday inns but by far this was the worse experience I've had checking in anywhere .I almost left. Did I mention how rude the desk clerk was...<//review>

Very clean and pleasant staff.  Due to Covid none of the usual amenities are available including the business center.  Wifi is offered but if you need printer access you will have to go office depot.  Breakfast is a brown bag with a sand which and yogurt and maid service is once every five days.  They are very compliant with Covid policies.   It is a comfortable stay.< /text>

The entire place from the time we walk up all the way to room was very nice and clean. Only bad part was breakfast is now limited to bag with muffin and granola bar. Previous stays included full on breakfast with numerous choices like eggs, bacon, fruits, pastries, etc. Will definitely return to this location and others in future.</review><username>RJG1014<//username></record></dataset><record>

We were disappointed when we checked into this hotel because when we booked these rooms on the phone with the hotels reservation line, I asked specifically for adjoining rooms. When we checked in I again asked for adjoining rooms and was told that this was not available/possible that day. I told the desk clerk that I had requested adjoining rooms when I booked the rooms and the best that she could do was 2 rooms on the same floor. The second issue was being woken up up at 3:30am by a phone call from the front desk because of another guest was complaining about screaming and yelling coming from our room. I questioned the front desk in person about this and was assured that the noise was coming from our room. Our TV was not on and we had been sleeping for 5 and a half hours at that time in the morning. 
This was extremely disappointing!!</Text>

Several restaurants.are within walking distance .We were pleasantly surprised with the modern room decor, comfy & clean bedding, great amenities (Bath & Body Works & lots of towels).. The mini-kitchenette with Keurig was a great addition to the room. The complimentary breakfast had a good variety of hot & cold options.A nice gated outdoor pool area. Overall a great value with booking direct as an IHG member.</Text>< pics>

The hotel took many precautions with the pandemic.  I am very appreciative of the length the management and staff took to maintain my comfort and safety.  However, there was one precaution I was not aware would be in place.  One reason I typically choose Holiday Inn Express is their breakfast.  Due to the pandemic, they were not offering the same breakfast experience I was used to.  I was not aware of this when I booked.  I'm not sure if this was my own oversight or if it wasn't listed on the site.  They did offer brown bag, grab'n'go option for breakfast, so they did have an alternative.</review>

They put us in a room that leaked water through the bathroom ceiling light when using the shower. Once we noticed it you could see where this had been a prior issue but not sure why they didn't fix it. This could have been an electrical disaster. Also, they have new mattresses but didn't replace the box springs and you can't move in the bed without making lots of noise.</review>

Check in was quick and uneventful. Staff was nice. They had cookies at the desk. Lobby was under construction at the time but it was not invasive. Room was clean and comfortable. Lots of power and usb ports for charging devices. It's not a big deal but My only complaint is that the toilet paper dispenser is on the wall behind the toilet. Not the most convenient to reach.</review>

Service was awesome, the room was clean and well maintained. Their morning breakfast was great compared to other hotel breakfasts, which included a neat pancake maker instead of the waffle maker. I would definitely stay here again. The staff was amazing, the front desk clerk was absolutely the best and everyone was so helpful and friendly.< /review>

The rooms are clean, the staff is friendly and the location is perfect for access to all areas of the Inland Empire. the Continental Breakfast has a decent variety of food to help get your day started.

I will definitely stay at this hotel again when traveling to SoCal.</review><Pictures>None</Pictures></record>

Once we got there the lady at the front started to help us while she was still helping out someone else. The check in process took for ever. Just help one customer at a time or tell the other one to hold on. That set the tone for the whole stay. Wouldn’t go back plenty of other Greta hotels in the area< /review>

I had a very good experience at Holiday Inn Express/Ontario Mills Mall. The staff was very friendly, they checked me in 3 hours before my scheduled check in time. We was able to park 2 cars for free without an issue. The place was clean and comfortable and I will book this hotel again.<//Text>

I found out totally after the fact that they charged me a 250$US smoking fee on top of the high end room charge.
I enquired about the charge because I actually DON'T smoke. They told me that doesn't mater and they will not reverse the charge no mater what. I used to stay exclusively stay at Holiday Inn apparently my loyalty means NOTHING. I stay at hotels probably 20 days a month. Sorry Holiday Inn I guess we had a pretty good run over the years but your loss I will now actively look for some other hotel to stay at. Be carful where you stay especially if the company does not care about the long time customers. KEEP YOUR EYES ON YOUR BILL!!
Because they will charge this after your stay and refuse to hear any dispute.</review>

Hotel staff and breakfast were great! Unfortunately the hotel is under construction, which we did not know at the time of booking. Our room cards would not work properly, taking several attempts to get in. Our heater was not working, and needed to be fixed. We could hear everything from our neighbors on each side, especially every time a door closed. The shower heads are old and too high up, almost like a rain shower. Unfortunately I had to wash out my hair by using the bath faucet since the water from the shower head had no pressure and was too high up. Im only 5'5". It also caused water to spray all over the bathroom floor. We will not be back.< /Review>

This little Hotel was a convenient location for an overnight business stay. Close to business, shopping and major freeways and easy to find. Even though it was near a major street, it was very quiet inside and relaxing. The room itself was quiet and cozy with lots of extras, like a couch, big TV, nice bed. The pillows are AWESOME. Nice and comfy to lay down on after a long day. I would recommend a night's stay here for business or a simple getaway day.</Text>

Average hotel in terms of overall experience. What it lacks in appearance and breakfast options, it makes up for in location and staff attentiveness. 
Pros: Staff, Location, Bed comfort
Cons: Breakfast, Interior construction (without notice)<//text>

herb smell. I was there with my grandkids and they mentioned
the odor. Thankfully they are too young to know what they were smelling. Let guest know prior to check in that there will be no maid service and breakfast will consist of a brown paper bag with a banana stale breakfast bar and water. You should be ashamed to offer this as breakfast.</review>< pictures>

<user_id>None< /user_id><review>This hotel looks fine on the outside.  However, once you check in you will find agents who don't seem to care much about customer service, a hotel that is a bit worn around the edges, and other oddities.  In my case, despite being IHG platinum and checking in at a reasonable hour (5:15 pm), I was placed in a "pool view" (brick wall view) room on the second floor. On the other side of the wall were the elevator equipment and ice/vending areas.  Every single time the elevator was used, the wall and bed shook and the hydraulic elevator equipment was noisy. This meant being woken up repeatedly through the night.  

The next day, I approached the desk to request a different room.  I was told that the hotel was sold out (in a dismissive way). Mind you, it was 2:30 pm and the parking lot was empty.  You would think that they could have moved me at that point, as many people would not have checked in.  Furthermore, the agent implied that it was my fault for getting the lousiest room in the complex because I never populated my preferences in my online profile.  That is a lie, they are there.  It's one thing for them to forget about my IHG status, not recognize it and not offer me an upgrade; but to be defensive and really rather nasty is another.  And I promise, I was polite and did not confront the agent.  She was very quick to be defensive.  The other agent I spoke with did not seem experienced or willing to do anything not on a checklist.

One other oddity here: I was sitting in my room at about 6:30 on my first night and I hear a knock at the door followed by it opening.  It was the maintenance guy.  I asked if I could help him and he just quickly apologized and ran off.  Weird.  

All in all, the lousiest HI Express I've ever stayed in. Although this hotel is in a convenient location, I would avoid it in favor of one of the many other hotels nearby.< /review>< pictures>

<Text>Nice hotel but pricey in my opinion during lobby construction. I was surprised a discounted rate couldn't be offered at the front desk to extend my stay for an additional night. I had to book Sunday evening at a higher rate online while attending a college graduation celebration. Sundays were usually a lower rate than a weekend rate. Due to no business center during construction, I did have to stop at the local FedEx office store to take care of a few items I'd planned to take care of during my stay. I also saved resources by bypassing the daily maid service during my stay.< /Text>< Response>

Great hotel, great value, beautiful room, and a comfortable room.  I chose the king suite.  The hot breakfast and the breakfast selection were just average.  Very close access to the Ontario Mills Mall, which is gorgeous!  There are several upper end and family chain restaurants within 0.6 miles.  I would highly recommend this hotel!< /Text>

I've worked with Holiday Inn express for 3 years so i know a little bit of how a hotel is ran. I was upset cause i couldnt use the card i had planned to use for the room cause it didnt have a  chip? and when i asked the front desk lady if she could just put the card in manually she said no that wasnt an option. It's an option at 99% of hotels including holiday inn. 
I loved the hotel it was nice and we had no problems at all. But the lady working front desk that night needed a better attitude. Especially with people coming in that late at night.<//review>

Had a very nice stay. Hotel was very clean and staff helpful and polite. Only thing is do to covid have to ask for coffee to make in morning and get only a breakfast sandwich and yogurt. But still atleast they give you something as some places just say sorry we can't right now. All in all will stay here again for sure.</Review>

I booked a room for 3 nights. I showed up a day late. Plane was canceled then delayed to make me stuck in Phoenix. I had tried to call my booking or hotel could not get through. I showed up the next day hoping to relax due to the already stressful trip. They had sold my room and refused to give any refund. Due to the fact I was not there the first night. Leaving me without.</text>

I know the hotel cannot control this but if you have ATT cell service and want to call someone you might want to consider another location as the cell service at this location is the worst that I have ever seen in a metropolitan area.</review>

<rating>1</rating><review>This place is not up to IHG standards.  It has been under construction for over a year and is still not done.  The hallway smelled like rotten food and wet carpet (1st floor).  The staff was not friendly and were rude when we asked for an upgrade (we're platinum members and supposed to get a free upgrade when available).  The air conditioning would not stay on in the room and the windows would not open so it got really hot and stuffy and we did not sleep well.  When we told the front desk they just said they would look into getting it fixed. Very disappointed in this location.</review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

<text>Very clean, good breakfast choices.  I’m on a specific diet and was still able to find good food selections.  Comfortable beds, quiet and good value for the property.  The only problem I encountered the whole trip was that they wouldn’t let me husband check in for us, which I would’ve preferred as I was in the car with a bad backache.  Also, the shower pressure is horrible.  Showers took twice as long because you couldn’t rinse the shampoo from your hair well.  The pool towels are tiny, so I’d recommend bringing your own if possible.  Otherwise it was a great visit and I’d stay here again.< /text>< gmap_id>

With Knotfest 2019 slowly creeping up on me I knew I had to look for a good hotel to avoid the camping. Not only was I able to score on a beautiful room (complete with mini fridge, microwave, and small living room) I had the best nights sleep, and was able to enjoy my nice cold beers. Overall Holiday Inn in Ontario Mills exceeded my expectations. This will be my choice hotel for every Knotfest from now on :)< /Text>

I specifically called the reservation desk instead of simply booking online to ensure that the accommodations would meet our needs.  I was told that the room was a 2 queen suite with a living area that had a sleeper couch.  This was not the case, and the end result was that a brother had to sleep on the floor.  Reservation desk personnel should be aware of what is in each room type.  Also, website stated there was a shuttle from airport to hotel.  There was not one, and we took a very scary ride in a cab, after we spent a considerable amount of time waiting on a shuttle.  The hotel did pick up the tab.<//Text>

This is an excellent hotel to stay at.  The staff did a great job of making me feel important as an IHG Rewards Club Member.  My room was ready early and very clean.  This hotel is very close walking distance to a number of good restaurants and shops.</text>

<text>Decent hotel but renovations were going on. Breakfast was decent enough for the family. The best amenity is the location in the Ontario Mills area. Hotel is close to shopping, restaurants and movie theaters. Also caught Bill Bellamy over at the Ontario Improv while we were there which made the trip just a little better.<//text><Name>D.Ohh< /Name></record>

I chose this hotel and location to stay on my way to Phoenix during a long-distance drive from the Central Coast. Check-in was a breeze, and my request for a ground floor room was cheerfully granted. 

I absolutely loved the King Suite room. There was a great working step up to conduct my Zoom calls and catch-up on work. The bed was super comfy. The AC worked great. I appreciated having both a microwave and a refrigerator.

The grab and go breakfast was a brown bag with a piece of fruit, a breakfast bar, and a bottle of water. The front desk made a point to make sure I got my to-go breakfast, which I appreciated.

The stay was so good, I booked another for my return trip!</text>

There were renovations going on in the lobby and the computers were down when I arrived, making check in (and servicing other customers) more difficult. The room was nice and clean, the bed very comfortable, but the walls very thin. I heard my neighbors alarms going off at 3:30am. Also, the shower has pretty poor water pressure. Overall, no major problems - fine stay.</Text>< user_name>

We love to stay at HI Express. This time the front desk people were extra pleasant and helpful. There was a little remodeling going on to enlarge the dining area I believe, so it wasn't as spotless as these hotels normally are but they had done what they could to make it presentable and it was not a real issue. Breakfast was a little less than we normally get at at HI Express, but we won't stop staying at these places since we have always felt our money was well-spent when we do. At least those cinnamon rolls we really come for were there and as tasty as usual.< /Review>

I would definitely stay away from this hotel. I know they deactivated my membership status to not write a review. I know how it works. If you like being disturbed early in the morning, please stay here. I had a DO NOT DISTURB sign on my door because I wanted to sleep since I had a difficult night and had no rest whatsoever. I got a knocked on the door at 8am. WHAT DOES DO NOT DISTURB MEAN TO YOU?! OBVIOUSLY, THEY DO NOT CARE ABOUT KNOCKING ON THE DOOR SO EARLY IN THE MORNING. I told the front desk agent in the morning and she just shrugged it off like nothing. I stay in many hotels before and never had an experience like this. In addition, there’s a lot of dust and loud people on the first floor, which is where they put me. I did ask for a higher floor or an upgrade upon arrival and the night auditor said NO. THE TV was also broken and they just moved me to the room next door, which was just as bad. VERY VERY HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE.<//review>

"Very Comfortable" and "Very Nice Staff" if you're in need of a Quality hotel then Holiday Inn Express Ontario Ca  will be your destination. Food and Shopping within walking distance. Parking is good. But rooms are more than you would expect.

"Breakfast", consisting of a go-bag with a bottle of water, banana, and energy bar, is beyond dismal.  No coffee - and you must request any from the desk (and go make the trip there) to use the machine in the room.  

But I know the staff is trying, though, given these very difficult times.

Otherwise;  clean room< /Review>

The breakfast was ok eventhough it needs a bit more diversification, they have a big parking lot so you won’t have a problem parking your car, they even have a nice shuttle service to Ontario airport. Couldn’t rely much on Laundry services as you had to send them at 7.00 PM and get them the next day around 7.00 which can’t be useful in case you need a specific shirt urgently. The check out was fast and the bill was very accurate. Overall price to quality it is still considered a bargain.<//Review>< pictures>

What I don’t like about most hotels is that personal staff talk to much on the halls and didn’t let us sleep well. But is not the first time we had that issue that problem is at most hotels we stayed in.

<Text>Nicely remodeled rooms thoughtfully furnished, including a bathroom night light. Decent free breakfast. My only quibbles is that it was hard to turn on the lights when entering the dark room (either the light switch didn't work or the light was very slow to illuminate) and that the door did little to muffle the noise from the hall. Would happily stay here again.<//Text>< Time>

<text>We stayed three nights at this Holiday Inn Express while visiting our son.  Location was superb as it was only a mile or so from a major freeway entrance, close to Ontario Airport, and there were restaurants and other services very close by.  Hotel itself was very nice--great rooms, service, and quiet.  We were very impressed with the quality of the hotel in all facets of operation.  We would definitely stay there again and highly recommend it to anyone traveling to Rancho Cucamonga.< /text>< user_name>

<userid>None< /userid><Text>So we had the king suite literally right above the front sliding doors. We heard them every time they open and close and it sounds like construction going on. If you get a king suite ask to not be above the doors. The neighbors were jerks and super noisy. Our fault for not making a formal complaint. Breakfast was honestly for us so much easier then over say finding a dennys to sit down at  we brought tit back to our room in out own comfort and ate. Our first belle service gentleman was so much help with all of our stuff including toddlers bags and toys. I wish he was working the next morning but we honestly dont know who was because we called for help to head downstairs and we were dropped off a belle cart. All I can say os whoever was working missed out on a good tip and we advised staff we asked for help not just a cart. Oh well .overall great place<//Text><gmapID>0x80c3358502dd7e59:0x2ffe9b6e3a422b1a<//gmapID>< name>

The stay was excellent good hospitality and a super friendly staff.

This a a nice hotel with all you come to expect from Holiday Inn Express. Clean rooms with perfect bed and pillows, an great breakfast. BUT if you have a problem their solution is to offer other hotels in the area and speak down to you. Paying good money to enjoy yourself with you travel is what should be expected.< /Review>

The first day I was not able to cool the room down .I had to call house keeping..The next day I had the a/c set for my preference. When I returned the next afternoon the room was at 80 %.the thermostat would not respond to the setting then I had to try to cool it down. again the respond time was a problem.

Next= the shower head was a hard heavy stream with no shower spray. It appears the head was plugged with calcium.</text>

<Text>It’s very close to the hwy so it makes it easy getting everywhere you need to go. Overall my experience was  decent. I had a kid screaming from 3 am till when I left for work every morning. Then the train is directly behind the building which woke me up. These two things the hotels cannot control but I unfortunately need better sleep than what I received so I’ll be trying an air B and B this time around.</Text><pics>None< /pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmapID>

Staff is amazing!!! The cleaning staff does a great job daily. Rooms are very large(at least mine was). The maintenance crew could use some improvement. Breakfast is the standard Holiday Inn Express,  but the the ladies in charge of it keep it going all morning (great job). The evening cookies are always good. I would recommend this hotel to all. It is in a great location , it's close to everything and I mean everything.<//Review>

I stayed at this facility on two separate nights because I had a late-arriving flight at Ontario-LA airport and a week later an early-departing flight. This facility is close to the airport and there is free transportation between the hotel and the airport. Because of my schedule, I did not use the breakfast. The lobby was undergoing some type of construction, but a wall prevented that from interfering with arriving/departing. The desk and room staff were very helpful. I would stay here again if I were flying to or from ONT airport.< /text>

Great location, super clean rooms, very comfortable beds, well appointed and maintained. Horrible wifi, our group stayed here on business and none of us could get a good signal to do work. Also they provide a curtesy taxi to airport that you schedule in advance. Unfortunately our taxis were late 20 minutes ( to no fault of hotel) and we barely made it to our flights. That said front desk staff and managers were always friendly and helpful. Would totally stay here again.<//text>

My boyfriend and I were getting away for a mini vacation. The hotel was perfect. Everyone we encountered was nice and helpful. Erika at the Front Desk is a great example of excellent customer service. She answered all of my questions and told me about all the local eateries. The cookie at check-in was freshly baked. Complimentary breakfast selections were yummy. I was a bit sad that bacon wasn't served on Monday morning :( I would stay there again.<//review>

Absolutely loved our stay!  Came into town to go to Dave and Buster's at the Ontario Mills Mall to celebrate my husband and my daughter's birthdays, and it was great!  Literally walking distance from the mall, and the hotel staff is fantastic!  Great location, and so many dining options nearby, it was overwhelming! The room was clean, updated, and well taken care of, exactly what I've come to expect from Holiday Inn Express properties!<//text>

Spa is small and hard to fit 2 people.  Room was clean .  Bed is amazing and had a great sleep.  Towels are good.  Internet is great.  Cable TV has good selection.  No movie channels.  Stereo in room  Like the little fridge and bar area.  Overall stay was nice.  Breakfast is very good selection< /text>< pics>

The ::) hotel has been completely redone, top to bottom and the changes are great. Breakfast was very good and they have a good staff. Food and coffee were hot, different selections of entrees daily and the seating area was neat and clean. Beds and pillows were very good and the room cleanliness was excellent. The air conditioner was difficult to adjust to get a temperature setting that was comfortable. The desk staff could be more friendly by greeting guests as they walk by. Parking was adequate and the property is well lit and feels safe. The hotel is within walking distance of many restaurants and the Ontario Mills. Overall, I would recommend this hotel to others and will stay there again if visiting the area.<//review>

Not a large reception area, but that's not really a big deal to me. The staff has been very nice and is always making an effort to see what they can do for you. The room is a good size, and there a sign that says they just put in new beds. The bed was fairly comfy, but it's just not quite right fit me. I was surprised that they had no recycling bins anywhere. And although the restroom in my room was large, the counter top was small and half of it was taken up by the towels. I'm not sure if that's because they're remodeling or because it's a handicap room, but there is definitely space for some shelving that wouldn't impede handicap access and would still get the towels out of the way.<//Text>

<Text>I'm an IHG member (love it!) and stay at Holiday Inn Expresses often, this was my first time staying at this particular property and I LOVED IT!
The rooms are spotless, the staff was excellent, and the breakfast was good. 
If your looking for a great place to unwind and relax... this is the place! Just about all the popular eating places are within walking distance along with the mall and movie theaters ( across the street!).
I highly recommend this property and will be definitely returning a few more times this year.<//Text>< gmapID>

Holiday Inn Express easily met all my needs (and wants). I'm quite impressed with this property and will definitely be staying here again. The only other place in this area that rivals this property is the La Quinta Inn and Suites. Great job Holiday Inn Express!< /text>< Pics>

Power outage from roughly 10:45 pm to 6:45 am. We were NOT notified. This WAS a PLANNED OUTAGE, per my confirmation with the power company. They notified the hotel via letter on Dec 27 and by phone on Jan 3. We WERE NOT notified of the outage. Management reported to corporate that they notified the guests with letters and offered to relocate. This is not true received none of that. Phones did not charge, air/heat inoperable, no hot water. I had to shower in the dark, get ready in the dark. We had to wait until 6:45 am for my wife to be able to get ready, this delayed us by a full hour, putting me late to the 3 business appointments I had all day. This location is unfortunately an embarrassment to the Holiday Inn Express flag and has completely botched what would be a very simple and easy work around.<//Text>

I love this hotel. First they have a more diverse breakfast bar than most, their bathroom products are dye and fragrance free which is huge for me and for the price it is well designed and comfortable. I would reccomend this to anyone traveling.</review>

I love the fact that Ontario Mills Mall is just across the street with a variety of restaurants near by. I enjoyed my stay so much that I will be staying here whenever I’m in the area.< /Text>< name>

Hot breakfast items such as the poor quality eggs and sausage need to be updated with quality ingredients.
Turkey sausage should not be the main meat available every day. bottom line the supplied meat and eggs are horrible for human consumption.</review>

The beds and pillows were beyond comfortable, the room was clean, the staff was extremely helpful and always had a smile on their face. This hotel is located right beside a shopping center with plenty of locations dine and even a liquor store! You will have plenty to choose from your free breakfast, I'm not a breakfast person but I could not resist! I highly recommend this location, I will definitely stay here again if I find myself in the area.< /review><pics>None</pics>< response>

We have stayed at Holiday Inn Express when ever possible, during our travels.  We recently became an IHG member, so hope to enjoy benefits soon!  This hotel was very easy to find.  The clerks at check-in were very nice and friendly.  Our room was warm when we arrived, and the fact that it was a cold day made that a bonus.   That was a nice change we have not noticed at other hotels, upon arrival.  The bed was very comfortable, as we find at all Holiday Inn Express hotels.  A nice addition to the two pillow selections, was a small pillow, which my husband uses at home, so he was pleasantly surprised, as he had forgotten his!< /Review>

They did have the best coffee!!< /review></record></dataset><record>
<Text>Upon arrival my daughter and I were graciously agreed. The hotel was out of the room type that I had requested, and offered me one of their handicap rooms. I was very pleased with the room they had given us. It was very spacious, comfortable, and clean. 
The breakfast was very good, with many options. 
If I'm ever in need of a room in this area again I will definitely stay here.</Text>< rating>

This is my go-to hotel when I visit my family in Rancho California. I can walk to stores, food services and do not have to drive once I land in the hotel. My family is welcome to use the pool, go to and fourth to my room. I appreciate this aspect of my stay. My grandchildren have learned to swim, with my assistance, and my adult children are welcome to use the spa.< /Text>

This particular location is the best that I’ve stayed at in this past year. I’ve stayed at 3 Holiday Inn locations and 1 Staybridge suites location... and this has stood out as being the cleanest, most organized, with the best customer experience and staff interaction.
I highly recommend this hotel if you are staying in the Ontario area.<//review>

The breakfast was not available because there was water damage so they we're doing the repairs. The spa was warm but dead... No bubbles... Just one jet was pushing water through. It was a sad weekend for us, as we were going on a date night thing away from home. Staff seemed nice, but it wasn't the best experience.< /Review>

Location was perfect. It was close to mount baldy and mountain high. There were many surrounding restaurants. Service was great. They allowed a 1pm late check out. What was exceptional was that at 3am my neighbor was playing their music very loudly. It woke me up. I called the front desk to complain and within 20 minutes of my complaint, my neighbors music stopped.< /Review>

<review>I am relocating down here for a job and my recent stay was excellent and I will be coming back for sure. Pleasantly greeted by Sandra at the front and I was identified as a IHG member. Clean and comfortable rooms, great shower pressure.

I wanted to comment on how quickly the Management and its staff addressed a billing concern that I had. Sandra took care of what I needed quickly and followed up with me. I like the way this property is being run, plenty of other properties to stay on the corner but its all about customer service for me so I will spend my money here and have my colleagues stay here as well.

The staff was very friendly and helpful.  This  Holiday Inn Express is in a great location. Lots of places to eat all within walking distance.  The bed was extremely comfortable as well as the pillows.  They had recently remodeled and was it ever so nice.  I am only 5'4" so the bed was a little high for me, but it was so comfortable.  We slept better than we do at home and the pillows were fantastic!  I know where we will stay when we visit the area again!<//review>

Everything was absolutely fine with this stay. I often stay in hotels, very frequently in HI:E. The room was good, check in was good, and the people were helpful. The breakfast was your standard hotel breakfast, which is perfectly fine. It's just the same breakfast that you get at every hotel across the country. Only possible way to have improved my stay was if there had been something(even something small) that could have been a "different " option for breakfast, even if it cost to have it.

<text>I had a brief stay at the Holiday Inn Express Ontario Airport-Mills Mall. I enjoyed my stay. The Front Desk Staff was welcoming and the Guest Room was clean with reasonably enough facilities. Particularly impressive was the number of electrical outlets for phones charges etc. Breakfast was fair but need to add more items , eg mushrooms. and oatmeal..< /text><pics>None</pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmap_id>

Staff is friendly, very nice remodeled rooms. Breakfast is good. The only bad thing is that the small pool water jet wasn't working, and there was some kind of short circuit on the exterior lights on that side of the building.</Review>

Interior and exterior of the hotel is clean and modern.  Free breakfast included. Spacious room   Internet was free (I believe it is free for members of the hotels rewards club).   surrounded by modern shopping centers, and  next door is small strip shopping center including couple of dining options, and short walk more is large mall, as well as many of the common chain restaurants.  I would stay here again for sure.    I had only one concern really, and it is a common concern I find at many motels/hotels:  the irrigation system sprays the car overnight which leaves hard water spots which require professional cleaning and buffing to remove- - unlike rain water which is soft and leaves no permanent spots.< /Text>

Power outage from roughly 10:45 pm to 6:45 am. We were NOT notified. This WAS a PLANNED OUTAGE, per my confirmation with the power company. They notified the hotel via letter on Dec 27 and by phone on Jan 3. We WERE NOT notified of the outage. Management reported to corporate that they notified the guests with letters and offered to relocate. This is untrue as we received none of that. Phones did not charge, air/heat inoperable, no hot water. I had to shower in the dark, get ready in the dark. We had to wait until 6:45 am for my wife to be able to get ready, this delayed us by a full hour, putting me late to the 3 business appointments I had all day. On top of this, I asked the front desk on two separate occasions to email me my receipt since they had no morning power and were way behind. BOTH times they did not complete this simple task. I also left a message with the front desk on 2 occasions for the manager to contact me. She NEVER did. I also left 2 voice mails with the manager to contact me. She NEVER did. Again, this was a PLANNED outage. They knew about this and did not notify us. Then they lied to corporate saying they did. Then they could not even return our call. This location is unfortunately an embarrassment to the Holiday Inn Express flag and has completely botched what would be a very simple and easy work around.<//text>

Great hotel in a great location!  My only issue at all is that apparently only chipped credit cards are acceptable payment.  As someone with a credit card that hasn't been updated to a chip card yet, this was extremely inconvenient. Otherwise everything was fantastic.  Comfy beds, clean room, fantastic staff!<//text>

< Review>
First off, the people that staff this hotel are first rate-very friendly and professional. I have two issues though: 
First-the desk chair was about 10 inches off the ground. The front edge of the desk hit me right at chest level and I am not that tall. I had the same problem last year at this hotel and at other HIE hotels., very uncomfortable, I can't fathom why they would buy such poor chairs.
Second-
There were about 900 TV channels and a card showing about 30 or so of those channels and their network affiliation. I found it interesting that all the liberal/progressive stations (Headline News, CNN and MSNBC) were all noted on the card. If you wanted to watch any conservative channels (CNBC, Fox, Fox Business or Bloomberg) you had to scroll through all 900 or so channels to find them. I think you should just be an innkeeper and get out of politics, it's a sucker bet<//Review>

<Review>Great hotel in this location. The room was great, beds were comfy yet squeaky. The bathroom and toilet were separate from the sink. The closet was in it's own area. I had a view of the pool and some parking area. Hotel was quiet overall. Overall, the hotel met my standards and I would highly recommend. I booked the same day and a room was available.</Review><Rating>None</Rating></record></dataset><record>

The hotel and staff was excellent especially Amber from the front desk. She worked very hard to provide me with excellent service in getting me the room that I wanted. She also was very helpful in my check in experience and she was very pleasant. Rochelle from the front dest was also helpful and wanted to put me on the fifth floor of the hotel ( inside joke). All in all I really enjoyed the staff.
As far as the hotel it's one of the best hotels in the area I've stayed in and I've stayed at a few and found this one exceptional for the price and service.<//text>

great room, nice hotel.

staff was not at the front desk but behind in an ante room and i stood waiting both times for them to come out (check in and check out)  they need a bell or a camera to tell them someone is at the counter waiting for service.

the pool towels are sweat stained disgusting hand towel sized gym towels.  the hot tub was cold.  Bring your own towels to the pool.  And don't try to move the pool furniture to sit down or set something on a table.. its all zip tied to the fence.. chairs and tables all zip tied up and tables uprighted.. weird.

great hot tub in the room.  nice little stereo to jam out to.

otherwise a nice modern holiday inn express.. I'd stay here again on business travel, but i really use the water facilities.. so maybe not for vacation stopover<//Text>

Excellent service and accommodations. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Rooms were spacious and well maintained. We stayed in a room with a Jacuzzi and enjoyed the set up that allowed us to view the TV and enjoy the music. Also having the refrigerator and microwave in the room was an added plus. Complimentary hot breakfast was great.
Our over stay was great and we will definitely return.<//Review>

<Review>A great room overall. Friendly staff and a nice location next to a mall and lots of restaurants and stores. There were a few issues like the ice machine on our floor didn't work, no waffles or biscuits and gravy at the breakfast room, and the shower head was too high for short folks like my wife to  reach to adjust. The King size bed was very soft and comfortable. We slept like babies. We were only there for one night otherwise would have taken advantage of the mall restaurants Overall i would recommend this location highly.<//Review>< rating>

I feel like I live in Holiday Inns and related IHG hotels. In fact, I flew in from another city where I had been staying in a Holiday Inn Express. I only stayed in the HI-Ontario one night this time before a long day's drive the next day. Thank you for the most comfortable bed I have slept on in weeks!

Also, the staff is extremely helpful and friendly. They always try to accommodate.

The location is great, as well, as it is within walking distance of many restaurants.</Text>

Old style rooms. The suite was more like a closet with two beds. You can easily find a better value just abouy anywhere else you go in Rancho. Breakfast was so-so. If you like half frozn muffins in the morning, then this is your place.< /Text>

<text>Our stay at the Holiday Inn Express was wonderful. The Hotel was clean, along with the rooms, they were nicely decorated also. Beds were very comfortable. Rooms had wonderful amenities. The breakfast was a pleasant surprise, very tasty. Plan to stay again next year. The only thing I was taken aback by was the 250.00 security deposit. I thought it was high.< /text>< pics>

< Review>
The experience was good. Booked a 3 day stay. After arrival, I needed to check out a day early. spoke with the staff on the first day of my stay. Was assured that would not be a problem. Next morning, turned in my keys to the front desk and was assured I needed to do nothing else. An error on my part was not demanding documentation but had never required it in the past. Arrived home to find I was billed for the 3rd night. Contacted the hotel and was told there was nothing they could do. So a nice hotel, just do not expect the staff to work with you if there are any issues and always demand complete documentaion.< /Review>

They waited until I checked in to tell me I need to pay a $200 deposit because I have a jucuzzi in my room. They need to advertise this on the website. I will not stay in this hotel again because this fee is outrageous.<//Review>

Have stayed here several times in the past and have had comfortable room and reasonable rates. This time in the first room they gave us, the television would not work and the in room safe was broken. Reported problem to front desk and she sent someone to repair. Over an hour later he was  unable to fix it. They moved us to a different room. The problem with the new room was that it was on the first floor and was not very quiet. The float in the toilet needed to be replaced. Worked intermittently. We like the location of this hotel, but the price has went up and the quality down<//Review>

I like the hotel am very happy with my stay.  I expect and receive the same quality of service every time.   I hate these stupid surveys that seem to go on and on and on asking the same questions like they didn't get it the first time.  Keep up the service, trim out the survey questions</Text>

The location of this hotel is near the History of Rancho Cucamonga and right across the street from the Ontario Mills Mall and within a short trip to the Ontario Airport.  It also has easy freeway access while being situated so that rooms are quiet.  With the cheery staff, overall you can't beat this place!<//Review>

<review>I've stayed at this location on several occasions and have never been disappointed. I consider it my home away from home when visiting the area from Arizona.
On my last visit, after driving 9 hours, I was greeted by friendly, courteous front desk staff. I was informed that my two queen standard room had been upgraded to a suite. I was very pleasantly surprised.
This location never fails to provide quality and care to detail. From check in to breakfast to checkout, other hotels should take a lesson.</review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

First of all, the Staff is tremendous. I had a question about my stay and e-mailed the hotel several days before my arrival. They answered all my questions and made sure my stay was worry-free. When I arrived, I was greeted warmly. The room was great and very comfortable. This property is among the top 10% of all Holiday Inn Express Hotels I have stayed. It's also in the most convenient location to work, shopping and restaurants. Enjoy your stay; I really enjoyed mine!< /review>

It is understandable that properties require updating and remodeling. It may help avoid accidents if the area is restricted with more than a sheet of plastic, ie rope or hard plastic barricade.</Review>

Poor location. Only benefit is that it is close to the airport. If you’re flying in and out and only need to sleep in between it’s perfect. Location in industrial area not close to anything in the way of restaurants, shopping or entertainment. Difficult to come and go on and off the freeway and very dark at night.
 No free breakfast as with other Holiday Inn locations. 
Near miss with maintenance. Friend left room to get ice while I was in the shower. Heard knocking soon after thinking she forgot her key. She arrives back in time to stop him from entering as we did not report an issue. Would have been an ugly situation had I confronted this stranger in my room! Reported to front desk once I dressed and checked out. Why would maintenance be scheduled for an occupied room?!</text>

The rooms have always been clean and very comfortable and up dated and are equal to if not better than Hotels than range a Couple of Hundred Dollars more for the same amenities.  I also like that some of them accept small pets if notified in advance as I had my 2 miniature Shitzu's while driving through Utah and Colorado.

We needed a place to stay since we sold our house and the new one wasn't ready for more than a week. Came on a Saturday and loved it. Left during the week because there were better rates. We returned for the next weekend. First night back was awful. There was a party in the room next to us. We ended up calling the front desk and they were able to stop the noise. However, we were unable to fall back asleep for hours afterwards not to mention all the hours before calling the front desk. When we asked about some sort of compensation for the horrible night of sleep, we we're told nothing could be offered. The staff was rude about, too. We were very disappointed about the way it was handled and this will influence what hotel chains we will book with in the future.<//review>

Fantastic service and clean hotel. The pillows were uncomfortable to sleep on, the people next door were playing loud music, and renovations were going on but that wasnt too much of a bother. 

Breakfast was cool, the oj was off but i enjoyed the food, they had salsa which went great with my veggie omlet. 

Wish i could of gotten better sleep with the pillows but bed was comfy.

Staff was friendly and helpful.<//review>

I've been coming to this hotel for many years and I have never had a problem. We always get great care from all the staff. Room are just right. The television channels provide a great selection. Hotel is close to the Ontario mall and many restaurants. I consider this place my home away from home where I feel happy and safe.< /Review>

After making reservations weeks in advance and letting the front desk know we would be arriving late in the evening, we were given the last room in the hotel which was not good. But they called it an upgrade. Some food served for breakfast was not cooked appropriately (omelets were burned on one side) and counters not kept clean. When questioned the upgraded room we were given it was not the type of room expected for an IHG rewards member.<//text>

Stay away. They add $250 smoking fee to your statement although you may not even be a smoker. You will not have time to stay and dispute it and they have all the time to ignore your argument. They claim manager is not in to wave the charge. That is a scam that they use to charge you more. If you have no choice and have to stay there report any smell of perfume when you get in your room or you will be trapped.< /Review>

<text>Stay in here for a stopover. Overall, hotel is conveniently located near the mall and airport, good service, clean and spacious room, and friendly staff. The room is adjacent to road, maybe bothersome for someone sensitive to noise, but we got a good night sleep.</text><GmapID>0x80c3358502dd7e59:0x2ffe9b6e3a422b1a< /GmapID>< response>

<Review>Decided to stay at this property because of its closeness to the Ontario Mills Mall, stores and restaurants in the area.  This was a mini getaway for my grandson who was on spring break.  We also were able to go the AMC movie theater and use the dine in feature. Also the mall was in walking distance.< /Review><response>None< /response></record>

I used to prefer this hotel over any in the area on business trips that I take numerous times throughout the year however there must have been a change in ownership/management because it is not the same the last two times I have stayed there. The hotel charges $50/day for amenities, plus they charge your entire stay at check in. When you check out the charges stay pending on your credit card for 7 - 10 days. All other hotels I stay at clear the pending charges at check out. Very different accounting procedures than other hotels. I am a Spire Elite Member and do not plan to stay at this hotel again.</review>

The hotel is clean, beds and bedding are superb. The cookies at check in were delicious. The hotel is close to dozens of restaurants and food choices, with several a very short walk. There is a large mall and 2 movie theatres within walking distance as well. The only drawback was that when I tried to check in at 3:30 PM, my room wasn't ready. It was about another hour before I was told my room was ready.<//Review>

Saying at this hotel was my first in this area. I am originally from MN and my family and I went on a trip to visit more family. We were greeted and showed to our room. I wish we would have been told either over the phone or on the website that the building was under construction that way we weren't surprised when we showed up. The pool area was not what it seemed like. The chairs and tables were locked to the fence so we couldn't move them if we wanted to, although it would have been nice. The pool wasn't heated like it said on the website and the hot tub wasn't even warm. On the upside of it all the staff were great, the room was comfortable and the breakfast was excellent.</review>

The hotel and staff are nice even though the hotel itself is under some very minor renovation right now. 
I was assigned to room #231 which is on the second floor above the lobby. It was a nice clean room, which I checked into around 6pm. When I entered the room, I turned on the TV and started to changed clothes to go to dinner around 7pm. When I got back around 8:30pm or 9pm from dinner I went up to my room and turned on the TV for an hour or more before I tried to fall asleep. This was when it all started because I kept hearing a "loud banging sound" from the outside window wall. The banging sound was so irregular when it would go off that I tried not to pay much attention because I just assumed it was coming from something outside the hotel. 
However, it woke me up again at midnight, 2am or so, at 3:30am or so and then finally at 5:30am it just kept going off continuously about every five to ten minutes. Just so you know I figured out what the noise was around midnight but I thought it would not be a problem again but was I ever wrong. (The noise was coming from the sliding doors in the lobby whenever they would move). So every time the sliding doors opened or closed that night, I heard a big bang sound and it would wake me up. I told the hotel clerk in the morning that it was a terrible night because I could not sleep because of the noise from the sliding doors and that the hotel needed to convert room #231 to a closet or something beside a hotel room for guests but I don't think the clerk really cared about my opinion because he/she did not offer me any real sympathy, except "I'm sorry."
To be honest, the clerk was a nice person but I just don't think he/she cared that the sliding doors were a huge problem to room #231 and me. Again, the hotel is nice but, "DO NOT STAY IN ROOM #231!!!!!". 
*I left the clerk hotel person without a gender because honestly the problem is not the staff at this hotel but just room #231 and the sliding doors in the lobby.</Text>

Omar's attention to detail is amazing.  He checked multiple times just to make I was satisfied with the work he did. Super easy to work with and do great work at a great price.  They stand behind their work and want to ensure you're happy with what they've done.  Highly Recommend them to anybody.</Review></record>

<user_name>Kuku<//user_name><response>None<//response><pictures>None</pictures><Text>I went there to get a new catalytic converter and they gave me the wrong one. The catalytic converter I had on my Integra has two plug for my o2 sensor and the one they gave me had only one place to plug the o2 sensor. I told him it wasn't the correct one and he told me not to worry, that he will drill a hole in the cat to plug in my second o2. After that my check engine light came on. I went back and he told me to drive for 30min and it should turn off the check engine light. I did that it was still on. I gave it another two days of driving around and it was still on so I went back. This time he told me it was my o2 sensor that is bad. "When I took my car in the check engine light was NOT on so my o2 sensor was never bad to begin with". I trusted him and ordered a new o2 sensor and guess what. The check engine light is still on.</Text></record></dataset><record>

Went to this post office a month ago. The guy who was helping me was so professional and respectful. I had been putting tape on the package that was to be mailed. The guy checked the package and put some more tape in places I had missed. Very helpful!</Review>

I enjoy visiting this PO. All employees are kind, courteous, knowledgeable, and helpful. I believe that their low rating is grossly unfair and does not give a true picture of service.<//Review>

Terrible service, terrible experiences, worst customer service. I wish I could give it a zero stars. Forwarded address and they still don’t give us our mail. Unprofessional workspace. They need better service, workers, and they need professionals that work there. Not people with gages and tattoos. I am so upset with this place and it gives me anxiety to even think about the post office. TERRIBLE. needs to be shutdown. I expect my stuff to be sent to the newer address. Not forwarded so I never get my items. GIVE ME MY MAIL AND PACKAGES. WHY ELSE WOULD U BE GETTING PAYED.<//text>

<review>Wonderful customer service from there staff. Also, I left my wallet there and I called to track it down. Thank goodness it was there. I told the gentleman I would pick it up the next day since I am disabled. He had a carrier deliver it to home. I cried, needless to say. Thank you for your wonderful service. I truly appreciate you.

I had a United States postal service  money order that I needed to cash and I had to go to the Post office to cash it. The staff here let me know with there attitudes and apologies to all the other customers behind me that I was definitely an inconvience to them and the other customers. It was very uncomfortable and unfair as well as embarrassing. They shouldn't sell money orders if it's so painful for them to cash them. And I will add that I didn't take any longer than any other customers so what was the big deal. The guy that helped me was named Manny.</text>

The staff here were incredibly rude to another patron. When I tried to stick up for them and advocate for them to be served, they were so rude to me as well, saying “was I talking to you?” and refused to serve the other person. Never coming back to this location.</review>

They have completely lost three of our Priority Mail packages and the service is sloppy at best. The most recent time they lost a package the man at the counter told me to go up and down the street and ask my neighbors if they had seen my mail. Whoever delivers our mail always leaves our mailbox wide open to the street (and supposedly we don't have a regular person, so they must just train each other to do that). We still get mail from the half dozen or so previous tenants of our house and the packages that do make it to our address are often left halfway down our walkway.< /review></record></dataset><record>

A lot of time the mail man will skip my box. If their is anything near my box he will pretend I don't have mail because he doesn't want to get out if his truck. I know I get mail every day. Also they deliver my mail to the wrong houses all the time. I don't trust the office workers. I own a side business that usually receives several responses when I go a mail campaign. I mailed several hundred magazines out and not a single response, I think they just tossed my magazines in the trash.< /Review>

I have been here 4 times for the SAME problem they are completely incompetent. Superviser or manager who ever is "in charge" does not know what he is doing, spoke to him directly 2 times and still the same problem. All they have is excuses for not reading...no joke I wish I was kidding but I'm not. And dont expect an apology for the SAME problem happening because they just will not take the blame. It's like talking to a 12 year old. Have to find  someone higher up to speak about this issue. Everyone here obviously have learning issues. Just horrible.< /Text>

<Text>Generally very good service in my experience, at least with things being delivered. I get a lot of mail for people who have not lived in my house for at least a decade, but that's the sender's fault, not the post office, although you'd think they'd realize who lives there since our mailman lives nearby and knows who we are. Service at the actual post office is slow, half because so many of the customers are morons who wait until they are at the counter before they start getting ready to conduct their transactions and half because a lot of the workers seem to see the public as a nuisance and think any time someone is about to get a turn means time to walk away from the counter and take a break or whatever they do in back. But that is to be expected with government employees: they see the public as a nuisance rather than their employer, and they have great unions that make it almost impossible to fire them for anything short of murder and even then they'll be on paid leave until the verdict is read, so there's no accountability and no reason to care about the quality of service.< /Text><username>Matt Celis</username><rating>4</rating><userid>111733959476042949358< /userid></record></dataset><record>

Occasionally I have experience good energy here. Sometimes it feels awkward, like the postal worker singing and making jokes, but overall my experience has been good!< /Review>

<Review>The postman was to lazy to bring our package up to my apartment and just put the sorry we missed you slip in my mailbox, well I'm watching him to deliver other people's mail ! We had medicine inside that my hb had to take every day for his heart!!!
I called the office to complain about postman  and they told me my apartment complex is not safe for delivery because everyone has dogs, and he doesn't have to bring my certified mali up to my doorway< /Review><pics>None</pics><resp>None< /resp><GmapID>0x80d950d4f6763227:0x15fd098bf059574c</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

This restaurant is simply perfect!

Staff were friendly and professional, and the food was so good!
We ordered premixed cocktails and wine and sat on the street-side patio while we waited for our table. The wait wasn't long and even though it was freezing outside, they took care of that with heaters throughout the patio area (enough for me to cuddle with one haha). I wish I remembered my servers name but everyone I interacted with was amazing.

The ambiance outside was quiet, cozy and romantic. Absolutely loved it.<//review>

Hit or miss. The first time I went there, I had one of the best pizzas in my life, the second time it was meh, and the service was terribly bad. It’s also due to the fact that they change their pies everyday.
Third time is the charm? We’ll see.</Text>

<Review>I swear every single time I come here they are prepared to "woo" me, if only the men would take notice...ehem!

I love this place, I took my friend visiting from Seattle to try their amazing steaks and she LOVED them. From the service when we walked through the door to the end of our meal, everything was Perfect!<//Review><user_id>101957873418050291038<//user_id>< Rate>

I can only talk from my experience, and for me, the food is ok. The pizza was burnt at the bottom, which could be tasted even more once you got closer to the crust since there wasn't any sauce or cheese to mask it. As I walked out, I began to eat the pizza only to realize that it was already semi cold. Also, the Bolognese pasta was only ok. There wasn't much sauce to it really and more meat and oil. After a while, I grew tired of the flavor and didn't care to finish my plate.< /Review>

One of my favorite pizza places ever! Although I don't go regularly, this is a big treat when I do go. My favorite is the Pizzaiolo special, wow!!! I so happy they are in my Oakland, CA!<//text>

Back patio was perfect for impromptu gathering.. We could have eaten countless margherita pizzas. The mythical "patio punch" served us well.
They were great about keeping the heating lamps going so that we did not feel the cold. See you soon.</Text>

A friend brought me here for coffee and a pastry after morning Mass and it quite a revelation. I have passed this establishment dozens of times and frankly never knew that it has a double life — in the morning it is a breakfast joint and the evening is a very fancy pizza restaurant featuring a cocktail menu and dessert selections.

Since I only spent a single morning here I can only comment on the breakfast hours which was very pleasant - the coffee was robust and the cheese and chive biscuit was quite tasty. The atmosphere was cozy - there was a mix of seating options from benches or booth setups and tables and chairs to accommodate individuals, couples and groups. Kiddos were welcome. Patrons could use WiFi. It was possible to enjoy a conversation and not feel rushed. I wouldn’t mind a return visit to try other menu items.<//Text>

Although it seems unassuming from the outside, the interior, with cute tables and chairs and a wall of wine and books, is fashionable, warm and spare. The service is dreadful and polished.< /review>

When pizzialo first opened, I gave their pizza 3 tries. Each time the pizza was really soggy, and limp. This wasn't take out, this dining in house.  Recently, I had some delicious pizza at a friend's house and it turned out to be from Pizzialo! Subsequent experiences have been much more positive and the last 2 visits were great. The salads, pasta, and pizza were fantastic. Great atmosphere too.</review>

I sometimes make a quick stopover at Groundwork coffee place near this place for my favorite cold brew iced coffee fix.
Then, I had a pleasant experience of new culinary discovery!
I had Bratwurst hotdog and Belgian fries truffle oil drizzle served with blue cheese n bacon bits dip sauce.
Delicious!
Ginger Beer by Fentimans was so refreshing!

I'm usually not a fan of sausages, but this place definitely quirked my interest.

Great service and high quality food ingredients and execution.

Will return for sure to try Bockwurst next time.<//Text>

😩🙌🏾 ORDER THE LASAGNA BOLOGNESE.... the best ever!! It comes sizzling hot in this round pottery dish straight out the oven oozing cheese and its the best thing ever. Top 10 dishes of my life. Also, the entire vibe of this place is so chic and trendy. The only bad thing is there is no sign, so hard to spot driving down the street. But worth the missed turn or two. I also had the vodka tonic and that was amazing!!<//review>

So much better than A16 on a million different levels. Staff amazing, service amazing, food so delicious. We were in and out of there at an appropriate amount of time. I think i spent 3 hours at A16 on a Wednesday night and we got one pizza, veggies, and steak.... why would it take 3 hours? I'm sorry, this is about Pizzaiolo! I'm so happy they are my neighbors. Thats all.< /text>

The best brunch, bread and dinner. Love their back patio, great for casual brunch. LOVE the buttermilk doughnuts. I would visit just for the doughnut and during the fall they have pumpkin doughnuts. Their fresh breads are excellent. Make a reservation for dinner. Parking in this area can be sketchy at night.<//Review>

<Review>Really good pizza, especially for California (I am a NYer so used to good pizza). The table enjoyed our cocktails and the beer list was decent. The wood oven pizza is really excellent so worth a visit for that alone. 4 stars for the gruff service and the fact that we were not there super late but were forced out at around 10pm because they closing and we were the last table (in fairness they said we could stay but put all of the chairs on the tables and started mopping around us). Maybe lock the door but we weren't lingering and it would've been nice to finish on our own time.</Review><time>1571426491545<//time><userid>117417503273437368940</userid><Rating>4<//Rating>< response>

The little gems salad was delicious, their pizzas are really good, that's coming from a Nyer. Service was great, everyone was very friendly, and restaurant was clean, nice relaxed atmosphere and not too noisy especially in the rear dinning area. I will definitely go back.<//review>

<name>Rissa Park<//name><text>Quite pricey, but otherwise a nice experience. The atmosphere is very romantic. Dim lights, artwork, brick, warm, elegant. Very nice patio seating.
This was a genuine italian pizza location. Unless you are familiar with Italian cuisine, I suggest looking up the menu beforehand, as we were unfamiliar with a lot of the items/terms. Wood fired pizza was delicious, but expensive and light on toppings. The desserts were great. We had afogatto and the seasonal stone fruit. There seemed to be a great wine/drink menu, although we did not have any.
If you are looking for classic pepperoni pizza with tons of cheese, this may not be the place. However, if you are looking for a cultural experience, this is a great place.
Pricing wise - we had 2 pizzas, bread, and 2 desserts and spent $70. Additional pizza toppings are $5 a piece.<//text></record>

Delicious, high quality food.  Fair number of veggie options; a few vegan ones, too.  Pizzas (no vegan options) are outstanding as are the pastas — linguini with clams and the gnocchi.  Little gems salad - heaven!   RE noise level - yes, can be quite loud.  Also, dark enough that phone flashlights came in handy for reading the menu.</text>

<Review>I love this place. It's romantic and quaint, casual and nice. I use to live in Oakland and came here more regularly but don't get out to the East Bay so much any more. We came here for dinner before our flight out and remembered how why we loved this place then. It feels like you are going to a family restaurant in a small town in Italy. The pizza is fantastic!< /Review>< Rate>

<text>The food is good, the location is great, the space inside is really noisy, and the service is hipster-snooty. I've had pastries here and they've all been appetizing. The morning porridge/oatmeal dish tastes lovely but it's lukewarm. The breads here are good too. The staff don't always listen to your order so come prepared to get something slightly different than what you asked for (eg no butter comes with extra butter, that sort of thing).</text>< Pictures>

< Review>
-As usual in SF, there is no parking available for the customers, however there is off street parking in the neighborhood and a plaza across the street with 2 hours free parking.

-The place is usually busy, we had to wait for 15 mins. A reservation would be more convenient.

-The service is really good and relatively fast with regard to the busyness of the place.

-We ordered classic marinara pizza and Alfredo pasta. Personally I did not like the food. It was tasteless however my company liked the food .. so I guess it is personal preferences.

-The value for the quantity and quality are pretty low.

Probably will not revisit.<//Review>

Like others I am also extremely confused why this restaurant has a high rating, I do not in all honesty think it deserves for several reasons, food taste and service alone. Once again, the average American audience that lack knowledge of authentic food and love for imitation
When I crave Italian I avoid going to restaurants whose chefs and staff are not from Italy, because I am aware it is extremely difficult to get it right. Lucia's in Berkeley downtown does a better job.

I visited Sunday evening around 7 PM, hoping for an authentic Italian cuisine. We started by visiting the female host who showed up a cramped up table for two, we then requested she take us to a spacious table, as a preference. She threw her subtle grumpy attitude towards this and was annoyed on our request, wherein in practice she should not want to give such reactions and be happy that the guest came in. However, staff don't care because they just want to get paid their salary and go home, it's NOT their business so why care, let's be grumpy.
Then after being seated, no one came to use for 15-20 minutes, leaving us completely ignored. I had to ask a guy walking around to serve me some water. Another horrible attitude for an above average priced restaurant. Upon asking the same guy to get my order, then came my server after 5 minutes. I asked her if there were any options on the menu with no meat Pizza and she plainly said "Whatever's on the menu." I do not think she wanted to work that day. I then told her that I do not understand the ingredients so would like her to help me point at some options, and again the non-gratuitous attitude followed. I ordered one of the Pizza and it came, to my mind, very distasteful. It was an Americanized version of imitative Italian Pizza and I was not interested in that. Sorry.

I am surprised that one of the co-owners is from Italy, she definitely has not paid attention to the operations, in my opinion. Sorry for being blunt.</Review>

Has a changing menu every week! Very fancy and posh. Cocktails were tasty and the food had good flavors. Had one of the pizzas, it has great crust and isn't big and cheesy, but more like a 12 inch size with gormet ingredients.< /Review>

The old adage that after a while the going gets tough deservedly applies to a place that has been open and on top of its game for so long. Pizza at $20 and overworked entrees (buttermilk fried chicken with harissa - the coating crunch slathered in the oily harissa is all you could taste - the lackluster duck ragù - the full of breading meatballs) make you close your eyes and think how good this place used to be. But you can easily find a table on a Tuesday night these days.</Review>

The restaurant was very loud at dinner time. Poor acoustics and the music was turned up pretty high. They sat 8 of us at a table that was probably meant for 6. And the food was okay but nothing special. One bright spot -- the service was excellent.  I don't think I'd go back considering all the great restaurant options in Oakland.<//Text>

< Review>
I am really confused as to why this place is so highly rated. I have tried their pizza, their meatball pasta, and their ice cream desserts. I was extremely underwhelmed by their pasta most of all since I can make better meatballs and pasta at home. I'm not a fan of their pizza and their ice cream. This place is extremely expensive, which is why I'm being so critical, because for the price there are many other restaurants that are many times better. My partner did not enjoy the food and found it overpriced as well. I am sorry to say... however, it slightly redeems itself with its ambience and their friendly staff.</Review>

One of the best restaurants in the east bay. The menu changes regularly and always features fresh, inventive dishes. Pizza is excellent too!< /Text>

Pizza is pretty good but always so expensive I don’t I have ever had a meal here be under $100 and I usually only order two or three pizzas (cause they small). Hope they got a new owner too...< /text>

<review>Everything I had here was delicious. Mozzarella with asparagus and prosciutto (creamy, super fresh), rigatoni with chunks of juicy chicken, pizza with sausage and a farm egg (of course).

I would also come here just to have their drinks. Their homemade ginger mint soda with some bourbon or gin is delicious.<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

The food is very good. Appetizers are ridiculously good and the pizzas are far tastier than your average pie. But the prices ... my Gawd. The prices, especially for appetizers, are absurd. I mean, $15 for three tiny meatballs? $15 for about 4 bites of halibut with kiwi? The pizzas aren't quite as horrendously priced, but at $20+ each I still won't be going here ever again.</review>

Creative and delicious taste and texture combinations. Outstanding food options range from granola, porridge, toast (e.g., ricotta /honey /almonds, cinnamon /sugar, avocado, almond butter /jam), turnovers, breakfast sandwiches, croissants, to donuts. Rustic, warm, lively space with good background music. Best bread I've ever had (and I really pay attention to bread).</review>< Pics>

Their homemade spaghetti was cooked to the perfect aldente texture. I am a stickler for perfectly cooked pasta. The clams were fresh and the sauce was quite oily and oversalted.
Their cocktail selection looked intriguing. I'll have to try it next time I'm there.<//review>

< Review>
We had a wonderful veggie pizza.  The crust was unique and memorable.  I really like the atmosphere at Pizzaiolo.  When a certain mixture of people gather in a room to talk, eat and drink in a restaurant, a unique chemistry results.  It creates a mood or atmosphere and this adds to (or subtracts from) the dining experience.  Pizzaiolo always has the kind of dining atmosphere I enjoy.< /Review>

This place was part of our once a month “Supper Club” that explores East Bay Eats

They have a wonderful house rule about keeping phones away from the table. Looking around, I noticed everyone was adhering to the guidelines. So cool!

The tables and booths are long and comfortably fit 6, we made an Open Table reservation (get those points!). Candle light and the quiet environment made this a great evening.

Everything here is splendid. A set of friends ordered a pizza with sardines and olives (2 things that typically make me dry heave). I found myself eating 2 pieces and wanting more.<//review>

<Text>Nice atmosphere and staff. Pizza is okay.

Breakfast is way overpriced and average though - $10 for a slice of buttered bread, a simple egg and a few chunks of avocado and you have to pay for coffee refills.</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

<Rating>5<//Rating><text>Pizzaiolo is one of our favorite Bay Area restaurants. Located on a super hip block in Temescal, Pizzaiolo has it all. It's authentic Italian with a California flare. The seasonal menu features both creative appetizers as well as staples such as fresh, delicious oysters and some of the best meatballs on the West Coast. The brick oven pizzas are a must, same goes for the fresh pasta dishes - the last time we were there we had a spicy squid pizza that I'm STILL thinking about longingly, accompanied by a spaghetti vongole, made with these tiny, sweet, tender little clams that were so truly incredible that we had to ask for a second order for the table because we just simply could not get enough. Not to mention the fabulous cocktails, extensive wine list, exceptional desserts (sometimes there is Strauss soft serve... *Heaven). The ambience is fantastic, the service is stellar. Five stars all the way. It's definitely on our go-to list, with the kids, on a date night, or with friends.< /text><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None< /Response><GmapID>0x80857de1012bd661:0x35a292bcedf52b5d</GmapID></record>

We have had many meals at Oliveto's--upstairs and downstairs! Never have we been disappointed. Our last visit was November 2016. The pasta dishes are authentic. The wine list is extensive. The ambience is relaxing and yet elegant. The wait staff is knowledgeable and helpful.< /text>

Delicious Italian style pizza with wonderful service. Some of tonight's favorites were the fennel salad with grana as well as the little gem salad, the margherita pizza with arugula and pancetta, and the sausage pizza (I'm forgetting the other toppings, but it was tasty and cooked to perfection). For dessert, the cocoa nib ice cream was a treat and the tahini citrus cake with blood orange was surprising and tasty. Highly recommended< /text>

I feel bad, cause I went with Joel, Jen, and Tianni and we didn't really order order much. 4 of us went and split a 12 inch za. I am pretty sure the waiter was like really annoyed at us, but I could have just been paranoid, because I was high out of my mind on edibles. It was one of those surreal head highs where you cannot understand why everything is so hilarious. I don't remember what we were talking about, but I was having a conversation with Jen when my mind wandered, and I blurted out "I can't understand what they're saying in this song".<//review>

It was super easy to make a reservation online and then when we got there we were seated right away. The service was on par, at times I felt like I was waiting on the waitress, but again it was pretty busy.

The food was magnificent. Best marg pizza we've ever had.
The atmosphere was enjoyable and rustic, differently felt comfortable.

I'd recommend this to anyone and we will go again when we're in town.< /text>< pictures>

There are some places where you just feel at ease, relaxed and are able to have a good time. This is one of those places. The vibe was fun, casual and comfortable. Prices and portion size are all on point. The staff were friendly and helpful. Peter, our server not only was kind and knowledgeable but honest as well. He advised us not to order certain things on the menu and steered us towards better dishes. He also stopped us f<//Text>

I've eaten here a few times over the years, and it's been up and down, with some memorably bad experiences when they first opened. After a long hiatus, we were persuaded to return for dinner, and sadly, it's a place to skip.

We 3 shared a marguerita di buffala pizza, the meatballs, a little gem salad, and fried chicken with potatoes au gratin, plus dessert. I'll address them one at a time :
the pizza, pleasant enough, but at $20, for a very small pizza, a little dear. Plus no basil in evidence, and instead of being sliced it appeared to have been merely lightly scored, which made eating it unnecessarily awkward.
the salad - delicious baby romaine and roasted beets, but quite a tiny portion, and again, $14 too dear.
the meatballs - not very good. flavor just meh. we make much better meatballs at home. and somewhat misleadingly, as it is listed amongst the primi with 2 other pasta dishes, this is NOT served with any pasta. there is a nice slice of grilled bread, but not quite what one might expect.
fried chicken - very good, tender, moist and tasty, but again overpriced. $29 for only one breast? surely for a secondi and at that price, they should serve a breast and a leg, or a half chicken. The most upsetting part was the potatoes au gratin, which were exceedingly undercooked, almost crunchy.

service was fine. we were probably not their target market, as we were placed in a back room away from most of the diners - and all of the heat. it was really too cold back there, and had i known the front of the house was nice and toasty, i would have asked to be moved.

Dessert was tasty enough, but portions! Really? Panna cotta tasted lovely, but i swear we were served max 4 tablespoons for $12. Honey cake was ok - same price, and rather dry.

So, we will not return. And i'd suggest you look elsewhere too.<//text>

<review>My favorite pizza, fried chicken and seafood place in the Bay Area! Jerome's fish soup, grilled octopus/squid. They introduced me to sparkling red (prosecco?). Everything is delicious! And years ago, before Ici opened, they were serving that sorbet and a taste of the pixie tangerine sorbet sent me searching for sorbet for weeks! But there is nothing that compared.<//review>< user_id>

Very tasty and great ambience, but it's Temescal hip pizza so don't be expecting anything resembling a New York slice and it ain't cheap. Cannot speak highly enough about how friendly and warm the staff are though, plus the new patio out the back is great.</review>

<text>Some of the best Italian pizza that I've had in the East Bay, Pizzaiolo is a great place to hang out with friends. It's pretty fun to come on a quiet, cold East Bay night and play some Bocce Ball outside while drinking some beer and then warming up later with some whiskey at the end.< /text>< Pics>

<text>They thought I was a 'Prank Call' and decided to 'Not' serve me. I called back and asked, "how did you figure I was a Prank call because I'm NOT...And 'Sam' the Manager's response was: I'm just making a decision to Not serve you. Horrible Horrible Service. F this place and Any place that doesn't value their customers, either on the phone or in person. Big Middle Finger to this place. Making a decision to Not serve me was the Biggest mistake they could have made. They clearly don't know who I am. Good ridden to Horrible Customer Establishments such as this.<//text>< Pics>

Not as good as I expected it to be. The prices didn't match the value of the pizza that was served and the service was mediocre. Pizza was Good except that portions of the crust were burnt. I assume that was intentional for flavor but I didn't enjoy it.<//Review>

Pizzaiolo is a little slice of heaven, a trip to Italy with the convivial atmosphere and good, fresh food made with produce and meats direct from farmers that you might think of when you go to ... Italy! Only it's right in Temescal. I love the music, the people, the warm spirit. It's also awesome as a pastry and coffee spot with great wifi in the morning.<//text>

<review>Really cute/romantic restaurant. Love that they use super local ingredients, I saw they had turnips from Full Belly Farm (I used to get their CSA). Had the arugula, pepper, guanciale, grana pizza and although it was very yummy, I give 4 stars instead of 5 on account or the size of the pizza for $20+.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< userid>

<text>The pizza here is wonderful, but EXTREMELY pricey. We came in about 3 weeks ago. Had a reservation, still had to wait 10 minutes for our table. My mother and father shared a pizza, and as soon as he took his first bite, my Dad asked my Mom if there were onions on the pizza, which she didn't think there was (NOTE: he does not like onions while my mom does). The menu did not list onions as a topping on the pizza that he ordered. Since the menu had not listed it and my Mom couldn't taste the onions he reluctantly continued to eat the pizza but the whole time was saying that  "this tastes oniony to me..." At the end of our meal when the server asked how everything was (although I am not really sure why he did not come over shortly after we received our food to check that everything came out OK) my Dad asked if there had been onions on the pizza. The server said yes, about half the pizzas on the menu don't list onion as a topping but do have onions on the pizza. Excuse me? We couldn't understand why on earth you wouldn't list an ingredient that comes on the pizza on the menu. Especially when the menu specifies "No substitutions." That makes absolutely no sense. Then the server had the audacity to tell my father that HE "should have known to ask if there were other toppings that came on the pizza besides what was listed on the menu." WHAT??!! WHY ON EARTH WOULD HE THINK TO ASK THAT?! The menu is supposed to describe the food, period. If we're supposed to ask what comes on a pizza, then don't list any toppings for any of the pizzas. Listing some toppings and not listing others, once again, makes no sense. And if you, OUR SERVER WHO IS SUPPOSED TO BE PROVIDING US WITH YOUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE MENU/RESTAURANT, hear that we are ordering a pizza that doesn't have all toppings listed on the menu, maybe PROVIDE GOOD SERVICE and let us know then that onions are included as an additional topping. Then he told us, "well, now you know for next time." Hahahaha are you kidding - there's not going to be a next time! Then he said that they would gladly remake the pizza for us. No thanks, we don't want to be stuck here for another 20 minutes. Not sure why the server did not offer to get a manager... or why a manager hadn't come by our table at all to check and ensure we were enjoying our meal! I noticed a gentleman standing near the kitchen line and asked if he was a manager, and he said that he was. I explained the situation to him and his solution was to tell us the same thing the server had "they would gladly remake the pizza for us, and now we know to ask about onions on pizza the next time." We don't want another pizza. You should have comp'd the pizza or given us a coupon or gift card if you really wanted us to come back. Despite the (EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE) pizza being very good, we DEFINITELY WILL NOT COME BACK here due to the awful service and management policies. PS: LIST ALL THE TOPPINGS THAT COME ON A PIZZA ON THE MENU OR TRAIN YOUR TERRIBLE SERVERS TO INFORM DINERS ORDERING PIZZAS WITH ITEMS NOT LISTED WHAT OTHER ITEMS COME ON THE PIZZA.  It's not the diners responsibility to know to ask about all the ingredients that come with a meal. That's honestly one of the most ridiculous things I have ever heard.<//text>< pics>

<Text>One of my favorite places in the East Bay.

Amazing food, good selection of wine, delicious cocktails, and beautiful garden seating with the occasional outdoor movie night.

Always great service, too.

Fave dishes:
Pappardelle with chicken + pork ragù
Summer squash pizza - thin crust
House marinated Castelvetrano olives for $5 = a huge bowl... easily feeds 4+ people as a side

Dog-friendly in the patio *only* if it's a service dog.<//Text><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

Great pizza, great atmosphere. Better than Delphina in SF, with more seating and selection.< /text>

Depending on where you sit in the restaurant, the atmosphere lends itself to date night, family time, girls night out, as well as celebrations in the semi-private room for parties of about 20ppl or less. The menu is seasonal and changes daily with almost everything made in house using fresh, local ingredients. Right now shell beans and tomatoes are on the menu and it's so good! Just a suggestion but I would get the housemade bread (Acme on mondays) which has a crunchy outside crust and a soft, doughy center to sop up all that yummy tomatoey goodness at the bottom of your plate. In terms of drinks, the housemade tonic is a must! Bourbon is my preference, but whatever you decide will work too. Also, remember to Leave Room For Dessert! Trust me, you won't be disappointed.</Text>

< review>
Dinner here on 25 June 2016 was a decidedly unimpressive experience in almost all regards.

We (two) arrived without a reservation, left our name, and were asked to return in 15 minutes, which we did.  At that point, we were seated immediately - at the same table, within arm's reach of the reservations podium, that had been empty when we first arrived.

We ordered a pizza (listed as having rapini and homemade sausage) and polenta with gorgonzola.  They were served simultaneously, as we had requested.

The polenta was tasty, although lacking any aesthetic with its single piece of gorgonzola chunked into the polenta.

The pizza arrived with significant portions of the rim burned to blackness.  It was nice to know that it was apparently done in a wood-fired oven, but with the well-recognized health dangers of eating charred food, it hardly seems a wise choice to serve.  (We happened to notice that the pizza at our neighbor's table was even worse in this regard, with nearly the entire rim looking like the remnants of a house fire...)

The sausage on the pizza was overpoweringly salty.  The rapini was cooked to an appropriate level and brought a nice flavor.  A big surprise was that there were nearly as many purple onions as there were sausage or rapini.  It seemed odd that they should be unlisted on the menu description.

Service by our waitress was competent and efficient.  The person who brought water, removed dishes, etc., did his job without a single word of announcement or acknowledgment - he just plunked things on the table where he thought they should go, took away items he presumably thought were no longer needed, etc.

In brief - there was little that was pleasant and nothing that was beyond expectations, while a fair number of elements failed to meet what we consider reasonable, basic standards.  For us, this trip to Pizzaiolo will almost certainly be "one and done).<//review>

<Text>I had one of the most delicious pizzas I've ever had here. A great thin, crisp-bottomed crust (with a nice amount of "cracking into shards as you bite into it" without being dry), chanterelles, and gremolata (garlic, lemon, herbs).

The "pizzaiolo" cocktail was also really good, and well balanced. Amaro, campari, tonic & lime (and the bartender makes her own tonic! though I don't know if this particular cocktail included it.)< /Text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

(Translated by Google) As I was alone in the evening, I was able to enter the store right away, but before I left, I was in line. The pizza is delicious. The atmosphere of the store was good and became a favorite.
