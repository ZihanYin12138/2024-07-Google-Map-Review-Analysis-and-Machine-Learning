<text>This is a nice Carl's Jr. It has been remodeled inside and has modern decor now. The food is good and is on par with all Carl's Jr. restaurants.  Service was very good and prompt, staff is courteous and attentive. The dining area and kitchen area were very clean and in order. Plenty of room for parking.< /text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNaHQeW9xPtGq2yPDy6P0zwbIJ_4J43TVqmkIlR=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPdQaTnsMVnkLIi24UiU1ZF7yyCQ20rrpgGy1gA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPnzEpFCnXLXpPfiqrN1zIAAFFMeIo8mfwv-Kf5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNhwsHKFeQx86bD_COyeW5idFpOkqixIgLufUuv=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMQ6AmAdo2PnDoXe4CTT3GG1mjJHb4icsYpQq3E=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN3GGtZ8m3iG2IToAfKe7l_GkP4PiLlMom0b9v-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics>< response>

<Text>This calls was very nice, very clean. They had our order out very quickly and correctly. We have allergies so we have to make sure certain foods never touch our food, tomatoes being one of them. They were excellent, took our order with a smile and new exactly who we were when we picked it up and went over the food with us. Thank you guys.< /Text><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

With everyone’s dining room closed, Carl’s was open & it was very clean in the dining room & bathroom. You cannot serve yourself soda - this is a minus star. The fries were terrible - another minus star. Employees very nice. Burger was good. I can’t believe it was almost $10 for my small combo. That’s too expensive & especially since I didn’t like the fries. I think they were old & not freshly cooked. I won’t be eating here anytime soon.</Review>

They have rename this place Lightening Fast Carl's Jr because they are very fast.  I tried to take a picture of how fast they were but honestly, we were done before I could whip out my phone. Food was just like I like my dates: hot, messy, with lots of extra bbq sauce and napkins. .</review>

The staff here is always solid. I speak for the afternoon to night people. Even "C" the girl managing tonight. She just needs to calm down a bit and be a bit more personable. Shes pretty intense. The people around her are dope. The dude behind the grill and the other lady at the register is solid as well. She's cool as well. Lol. So the food here is good and so is the customer service.

I come in late evenings and I tend to be out of it at times due to being up at 3-4am and dealing with crazy travel times. They do good work and handle a demanding crowd. I wish every Carl's Jr was like this crew. They sometimes miss on my order, but I don't mind. Chances are they brought my order out to me or some other out of their way type thing.

But seriously I was throwing comedy gold and it flew over her head.</review>

Sad to say that I don't care for the remodel. I prefered the way it was. The new seats are very nice, but I don't like the high seating. The booths make more sense since you have private seating and not sitting with strangers.< /Review>

This place has a full bar, the food is a Mexican- Japanese fusion, it sounds wierd but the wife and i really liked it, and eventhough the place was pretty full it didn't took long for us to be seated, the service was also pretty good, our waitress was very helpful suggesting and describing the dishes, friendly and attentive, we will be coming back soon<//Review>

<Text>It's good, but losing the Carl's Jr motto of it belonging in your face.
It's rapidly declining to "LOW BUDGET" take it as it comes.😲
In and Out has not been trying to get in any loop, they are in a totally different class.😋</Text></record>

<response>None<//response><review>Hey Carl's JR corporate,

Maybe a memo should be sent out to all employees:

Employees should conduct themselves in a professional manner. Employees should refrain from speaking about how many flies are in OUR restaurants!

Disgusting, I'm trying to eat my food and the employees are just sitting around talking about how many flies are in the RESTAURANT. WOW!! I don't recommend this or any Carl's Jr or Hardee's!</review>< rate>

Sales person said car was SMOKE FREE but later I found an old cigarette hidden in the back seat cup holder. I didn’t say anything as they weren’t helpful the first time and just wanted to sell the car. My fault for not inspecting car closer at first but also shame on them for saying it was smoke free knowing the past owner was a smoker.</Text>

They have a great car selection compared to other used car dealerships in the valley. They make the buying process quick, easy, and they don’t waste your time. Would recommend.< /Review>

I would like to start off by saying it's not my dream car, but it is a nice family car. Gets me to, and from. I appreciate Jay "Jayrold" who helped us as much as he can. I hope you guys can give them a try. Although be prepared to give them as much imformation so they can fully help you! May God bless you all. 👐<//review>

Amazing selection of great vehicles. The sales and service staff are professional and the dealership is clean! Two Locations Delano/Wasco - I would highly recommend Delano Family Auto to my friends and family! Stay tuned for more photos/videos of this location and the Wasco location too.

(Translated by Google) The Xerses Vendor or as everyone knows the X is a very knowledgeable and friendly vendor. It guides us through the process with ease. I also want to thank Chris who is the Sales Manager for making everything possible for us to drive home in our 2017 Honda Accord. That team at Delano Family Auto is the best I've ever seen.

<Review>This is a nice area. Soccer/ Football Youth Sports are held here. There are bathrooms and a large gravel parking lot.< /Review><Date>1561606428754< /Date><Response>None</Response></record></dataset><record>
<text>Great location , poor management with old outdated stalls . Stalls are tight and not well equipped and constructed!  Horses are dying of the many flies and warmness! Bcz the roof is a curtain tent one ! Seems to me just care about the money. I spoke to some of my fellow Europeans and they said we can't believe in America your barns are so old style !< /text>< gmapID>

I Give the best spaghetti in town a shout! I crave their pastas constantly. For the first time since the COVID pandemic started, I finally gave in to my cravings and I'm so happy I did! Not only is it unbelievably good, yet for less than $11, you can't find this volume of pasta, bread sticks, and 10/10 service anywhere! This is not going to be my last time back during COVID for take-out.<//review>

My family and I have been coming here for over ten years and the pizza never disappoints. The pizza dough is the perfect thickness and gooey-ness without being too gooey. The sauce and toppings are plentiful and the taste delicious. Luigi’s is by far the best pizza in the area. The vibe is great, too. The place is family owned and operated and the service is quick and friendly every time. A great place to bring your family or host a pizza party. I sincerely hope they make it through the pandemic, as it would be such a loss to the community to loose this great place!</review>

Excellent pizza - the  dough is over 180 year old dough recipe from Sicily.   Their sauce is made from scratch every day as well. Try their vodka marinara creamy sauce with their meat or butternut squash home-made ravioli.<//Text>

I hate takeout but have no choice I order Stromboli and it was horrible waste of my money. Pizza not the best but eatable and fettuccine sauce was plain also order spaghetti and meatballs  but the meatball was not good. I will never eat here again. Trying to support local and family own restaurant cuz tired of eating all the chain restaurants it hurts when the food u get and pay is not good quality< /Review>

Very good italian style pizza with a good chew to the crust... Brings back some childhood memories of Vesuvio's in Santa Clara. Also super fast order and friendly staff. Will definitely be back. With Garrett Station right down the street (hands down the best pizza in the area), I might have to alternate pizza joints</text>

They have been here since... Idk like the late 80s or early 90s? There is a reason they've lasted so long. The pizza I got was crazy good.

I remember that back in the day the pizza was amazing but so greasy that the crust tasted fried. Honestly, greasy like no other pizza I have had before. I'm a little disappointed that they aren't greasy anymore, but somehow their pizza is just as good. All I got on it was pepperoni and olives, but it still tasted special somehow. Perhaps it was the sauce? Something about it tasted special though.<//Text>

Went in for my first time since it is close by to my work. Decided to go with the chicken Alfredo pasta they made it fresh and had lots of flavor. While waiting for my food they were serving pizza which looked very good as well I may be back again to try the pizza. Great staff super friendly.</text>

<Review>The pasta here is very good. The ambiance is a bit dark and dated and could use an update. While the pizza is made fresh the pasta is made earlier so it's not as fresh as it should be. It is served immediately though.< /Review>< Pictures>

The pizza is delicious. Super soft and chewy crust, baked to a puffy pillow of perfection with a blanket of cheese and toppings. The food came out amazingly fast. The kids loved their pasta with butter. You could smell the butter wafting up from the plates.<//review>

Luigi's is down the street from my work. My coworkers decided to try it out. Their pizza is delicious but their stromboli is killer!!  We also ordered breadsticks. Portions are great, you will leave full and happy. Will return!!< /Review>

Its light and the perfect amount of crispy with not extremely overloaded toppings. Also their pastas are delicious and in my opinion very authentic. Finally, the owners are very helpful and understanding. I made a mistake in my order and they were very accommodating even after I was charged.</Text>< pics>

Every visit is consistently satisfying and we leave full with a smile. We love their butternut squash ravioli with marina (has cream), their pizzas, and the value pricing for the dine-in kids meal special. Aso, who can argue with free bread when dining in as well. Family owned and operated. Happy to support this local gem.</Text>

I just went here for the first time about 2 weeks ago with my boyfriend and I had the baked mac and cheese, green eggs and ham pizza, and the linguini. Most amazing food experience I've ever had in my life. If lived closer I would definitely eat here everyday to eat everything off the menu. It's become a tradition for me and my boyfriend to eat there at least once a month because of how amazing the food is! 10/10 would recommend to my friends and family</text>

The food was absolutely amazing. I'm from SoCal and I've never had Italian food as good as this restaurant. Definitely would recommend to anyone who is trying to find a good little spot to eat. Also I love that dining area wasn't too busy for dinner I was able to hear and talk to my date perfectly fine without yelling. We will surely come back to this restaurant whenever we're in the area again!</review>

Food was ready quick and when I got there got a good family friendly vibe . Ordered Super baked Rigatoni,  pesto chicken pizza with Italian sausage and spaghetti with marinara sause , everything was super good loved it . My daughter is super picky and she loved the pasta.  The pizza had a lot of flavor and was real good . It's hard to find an Italian restaurant that does both pizza and pasta super good and we found it . Good prices and good size portions.

My family and I have been coming here for 10+ years. This is the best authentic Italian Family owned restaurant. My grandfather moved here from Italy and I grew up with some great food, I know Italian cooking. The pizza is amazing, the Stromboli's, all the pastas are great .My lil one requests this alll the time, like tonight. They have a bar with good vodka and wine etc. You have to try the baked rigatoni. It is located in a shopping strip next to the movies so very convenient as well. My only wish is that they play some music but you don't need it with this food. Try it!!</text>

<Review>The food is good , but not great. I really like the fresh bread sticks that are made from the pizza dough. The food looks really good, but it's a bit on the bland side for my taste. I go there sometimes when I want to eat before going to the movie theater next door. I haven't tried there lasagna yet, but I'd like to. It looks like it could be good; we'll see! Try this place for yourself, a lot of people really like it and are big fans of the food.</Review><pics>None< /pics><response>{'time': 1555945571854, 'text': 'Thank you for taking the time to share your thoughts on our food.

We ordered take out tonight, penne w/meat sauce, stromboli and baked rigatoni.  I love your food but, was disappointed to find a dark long hair in my penne.
Perhaps you all should wear hair nets?
Are you willing to make this right?< /review>

<review>An unassuming entrance in a strip mall containing a Dollar Tree hides an unexpected treasure of a pizza and pasta restaurant. First off, the pizza is fantastic. Hot, gooey, and absolutely delicious. It is complemented by a nice assortment of draft and bottled beer. The service is friendly and quick. The atmosphere is cozy, friendly, and warm. A terrific find. I will be back.<//review><pics>None< /pics><response>{'time': 1545071394240, 'text': 'Thanks so much for taking the time to leave us this thoughtful review!'}<//response>< GmapID>

I enjoy coming here because I know what to expect: rich Alfredo sauce, no wait service, a lot of breadsticks (on the well-cooked side), and a Moscow mule fishbowl for 2 that's tasty (and kinda weak). I like that it's not huge and that it's carpeted which dampens the noise.<//review>

Great for take out, and the restaurant is usually pretty empty for dinner. Great place for a casual date night with kids, or before a movie.
Pastas are excellent. Great sauce, ravs and noodles.
Pizza is good, they serve a lot of sides and dishes with a side of garlic bread which is their pizza dough with garlic powder and parm.
Salads are not good. It looks and tastes like cheap lettuce and croutons from a bag.<//review>

<review>Had a special event and owner (Luis) took excellent care of us. He reserved a table, prepared the salads and pizzas exactly to our requests. Even though the restaurant was starting to get busy, we were never rushed. Everything was outstanding! I highly recommend Luigi's if you are looking for the best pizza and pasta! They also have a great private event room.<//review><Resp>{'time': 1512406484633, 'text': "Thanks, Edward! We're really glad you had a good time & enjoyed our excellent service.

<text>Great service and Great food. This was my first time there and I’ll be going back when I’m in the area. I ordered the spaghetti platter. Portions were very respectable, coming with 2 meatballs and a bunch of breadsticks, unlike California Pizza Kitchen where I ordered their plate of spaghetti and received a child’s portion, with no bread or meatballs. Both were roughly the same price.<//text><time>1544665899899</time><gmap_id>0x808e351e7bf91305:0xfceadc96a24c0d00<//gmap_id>< user>

The guys are Luigi's get it done.  Great value, good quality, fast service, family environment.  Ask the owner if you want something special and he'll make it for you.  He'll make suggestions, explain the menu, work with you to create your own experience with various pasta's sauces and combinations of each...creative, engaging, they treat you like family and overall always a good time.  Been there 100's of times and go back frequently.<//text>

A family owned and run restaurant offering tasty Italian fare served in a casual dining room. In recent times, they have taken many items off the menu, so there are far fewer choices. We were especially disappointed when they removed the salad bar, which was a key attraction for us. They have also removed their sandwich offerings, which we used to enjoy. Sadly, we used to eat here often...once or twice a week, but now due to the all the menu changes...we only eat here every couple of months. Normally, it easy to find a parking spot nearby.</text>

Looks like a good spot, don't know if it gets better at night, but the Stromboli I ordered was cold, also they used Craft cheese slices on the inside, very odd for a world famous dish. Service was okay, I was the only one there.<//Review>

<Rating>2< /Rating><text>They make you pay in advance  (and they ask for the tip in advance, too). There is no table service, they just bring the food, like a burger place. The portion was too small for the cost. I liked the bread better than the ravioli, which was ok. If not for the bread I'd still be hungry. Overall I'm disappointed & won't be back.< /text><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

First visit? I highly recommend the spaghetti Bolognese. Off the hook delicious. Linguine and clams, red sauce is another favorite. Plenty of pizza crust bread on the side. Yummmm< /text>< date>

The owner himself helped us and he was very friendly and helpful. We grabbed a table and our food arrived in less than 20 minutes. The Chicken Alfredo Carbonara was one of the best Italian dishes I've ever had. The Chicken Parmigiana was spectacular as well. The kids enjoyed their mini cheese pizzas and we enjoyed eating for under $50 for a family of 4. Great food, great atmosphere, stellar service and great pricing. This place will be a new family staple.<//review><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None</Response>< Gmap_id>

We came to find that this was a waste because the food was so incredibly bland and terrible. Pasta was watery, pizza was soggy, meatball was rubber. The only positives were the free bread (which was bomb) and the fact that the food arrived warm. Never eating here again, even the dog hated it.<//review>< time>

<Review>Very friendly owner and is quite a character. I wouldn't be surprised if his grandfather was the Godfather.

I ordered the daily special pasta which the owner promised that I would like. And I did. The pasta came out quick and hot along with 3 pieces of breadsticks. Everything was tasty, but nothing really mind blowing. $15 might also be a bit too much for a plate of pasta with self serve service.</Review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

This is a nice place for a quick meal. You order at the counter and they bring it to you. The staff was nice and friendly. The food came out quick and the Carbonara and Chicken Pesto pasta was good. Haven't tried the pizza yet.</Text>

Been coming here for over 30 years...... One of the best pizza joints in the bay area . Pastas and Stromboli their specialty. I wish the bread had a bit more flavor, but it's free.</review>

Their food comes in large portions, can share one plate and a thing of bread and be satisfied. They carry wine, beer, soda, and a few hard alcohols. Great food great service< /review>

The pizza is good, although I personally believe there is better pizza out there, if you are willing to pay 30% more. But for the price, you get a great value. It's also a fun place to go. People are very friendly. If you go on a date, try the pasta dishes, and some good wine. An excellent way to spend a Friday or Saturdy evening is to go to the movies next door, then come over for a nice dinner. I also go there from time to time, and just hang out by the bar and have a drink. Usually, there are some people hanging out, and you can enjoy a relaxed evening.< /text>

Their breadsticks are always hot and tasty (they're better than Olive Garden's!). It's the best Italian restaurant in the area, so make sure to visit it! I recommend the chicken alfredo!<//review>< Pics>

We thought this was effectively communicated to you when you called, and we appreciate you providing us with feedback. We continually use reviews to grow in the service we provide our guests. When we are busy, we don't have as much time to pay attention to what customers leave on the tip section, and we could have caught it for you, had we been able to catch the mistake. Please come in and you can be refunded the 24$ tip charge. Take care, and again, thank you for leaving us your feedback."}</response>

I would not reccomend this place as they tricked me into paying double the price for one pizza when I was distracted with my kids. And when I called the owner said since I signed I cannot dispute the charge. They put in a $24 charge for tip on top of the over priced $24 cheese pizza. I will never be going to this establishemnt again and would advise all to keep a close eye on your receipts!!!!<//text>

I have been to the 24 hour fitness gym in San Clemente, I have been to both of 24 hour fitness gyms in Irvine and I have been to the 24 hour fitness gym in New Port. All of those gyms are not even close to the same level the San Juan’s  24 hour fitness gym. San Juan 24 hour gym is very clean and their staff are the best staff I have ever talked too and all the staff member are all super helpful and friendly! 10/10! This gym is GOATED🐐🔥<//text>

Ok I'm very thankful they built this new gym. Truly overdone for all of us who been going to the old one.  The design and layout works perfectly for and my needs.

Please check this new 24 hour fitness if you get a chance.  You wont be disappointed.<//Review>

The reason of the two stars goes to the all corporation. There should be at least 1.5 hours to allow your guests to work out. Also what about the fees. Are you planning on reduce them??? Facts are we are giving a third of the service we had before.</text>

Today was a leg workout and the facility (in my opinion) lacks some leg equipment like a good leg extension and lying leg curl machine. I find the Hoist equipment to lack in full range of motion.
The weight room does have all  Hammer Strength for chest, back and shoulders. It also has a turf section for athletes.
Nice gym; except for trashing of legs.<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

This new gym is pretty awesome. I go here now just for the turf and because the Laguna Niguel one has kind of gone downhill.  Everyone for the lost part is super friendly and has a decent set up.  Only thing kind of lame is how there are only the two water fountains in such a large gym. One on each floor but both set to one side.  All the new machines are nice and clean and I really hope this place stays as nice at it is< /Text>

<Text>Been a member for over 7 years now. The design and layout is terrible. Weights are too crowded and for some reason on the top floor. So you can flip a fake tire? Who cares. And good job putting the Olympic weights above the kids club. It's just sad this was built from the ground up to be such a disappointment.<//Text><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None</Resp>< gmapID>

For how old this place is, it is my favorite. Staff is chill and helpful. Machines are old, but are ssllooooowly being updated. Small, but has the basic necessities. Never felt uncomfortable or uneasy. Kind of like an old sweatshirt. Comfy and ragged, but not so ragged that you would chuck it, but ragged to were you wouldn't wear it on a date or job interview or outside.</review>

<rating>3<//rating><Review>It's the long forgotten 24 Hour Fitness. They never update the equipment or the facilities. It's an old gym that feels even older. But you'll never find it overcrowded and you'll never find yourself waiting to use yhe equipment. That's gotta be worth something, right? And 15 years from now you'll find the same people working out here that you did 15 years ago. Maybe there's comfort in that?<//Review>< Pics>

On the plus side, there is ample space in the exercise classroom for participants . Unlike the San Clemente gym which is always kept at a comfortable the temperature, San Juan Capistrano is maintained at 74 degrees and feels like a sauna despite two blasting fans.< /review>

Excellent facility. As a gym rat I am pretty critical when it comes to scrutinizing various workout spots and this place gets my vote of confidence. This gym has a good selection of free weights and cardio equipment. The manager Vince is extremely involved and runs a tight ship. My only caveat is that some of the machines are a little out of date but still completely functional</review>

Only some staff is nice- but never on the phone.
Can never get in touch with a manager
(after they charged me twice -2 times = 4 times and refused to give any money back)
The girl in charge of payments is extremely rude and said multiple times "I don't know what you want me to do. I refuse to give your money back." Looked confused the entire time. horrible.
take your money to a different gym. I will no longer be going here.<//review>< pics>

I went here for a spontaneous workout with my bf who is an avid member. I haven't set foot on any of their facilities for over 7 years. While he was showing me how to use correct form and convince me that lifting weights could be enjoyable, the fitness manager, Branislav, approached us to tell us that "training" wasn't allowed and "clearly that's what he was doing." Both totally taken by surprise and unsure of what was "not allowed," he continued to tell us that "clearly" I was being "trained" and not working out together. My boyfriend and I were so out of whack by this whole exchange we let him know we were offended and repeated how unsure of what he was talking about. Continuing to be accusatory and stating other trainers have been watching and so was he, what we were doing was unacceptable. Nobody is a trainer and nobody is trying to be trained, sir. Such a completely absurd and weird exchange and extremely poor customer service. There were so many other ways "not allowed to be a trainer on their facilities," could have been handled.< /Text>

<rating>1< /rating><text>I go because I live close by, it is old and outdated but that doesn't mean it has to be dirty. The machines are often broken and it takes days to get them fixed. One of the fans was so filthy that you couldn't feel the air (I noticed that it was replaced). The bathrooms are gross and usually out of supplies, as is the rest of the building. The stairs are worn and in need of repair, lawsuit when someone trips on the loose rubber matting in the future. I saw a group of what I assumed was upper management once walking around with their notepads inspecting the place. I voiced my concerns but obviously fell on deaf ears. The staff though is very nice and always polite although they do seem to have a lot of down time as they are usually at the front desk chatting or on their phones.

Old gym, with loyal long time members and friendly staff.
HOWEVER.....The place is filthy, the machines and equipment are antiquated, the locker rooms are small, the bathrooms gross, and the security non-existent. Frequent break-ins, both in lockers and cars in the parking lot.  Go elsewhere.</review>

This location is old and beat up with many of the equipment not working properly. However, a brand new facility is opening right next door in late Dec 2018</review>

<review>Wow! Called and they said it was $100 to replace the tires on my bike. They took it to do the 2 hour job and charged me 200 (100 for each tire) plus 25 for balance and 8 for recycling. I'd never go back here. If you're getting work done get the FULL price before you let them do anything.<//review>< Pictures>

Example: they will tell you it's a 2014 Yamaha raptor in reality it's a 2012. They are friendly when it comes to low cost repairs but will cut corners and misdirect you on major repairs. I will most definitely not be buying here again. PM me if you want proof.</review><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

< review>
Not sure why Mr. Yokoi is complaining... The pictures hes attached to his sob story review CLEARLY show that, feromas prices are posted for ALL to see- $100 for mounting a tire. By the looks of it he had 2 tires mounted, soooooo what's the real problem??
I happen to know for a fact, that when you bring your bike in for new tires, you are given a price BEFORE any work is started. AND if you buy your tires from Feromas, they DO NOT charge for balance and/or disposal #truestory< /review>

Suprisingly a Motorcycle motorsports store ran owned and operated by friendly helpful women. Whom are very knowledgeable of components and bike operations. we need more places like this without the stereotypes. I spent more than I should have and will be a patron to Feroma because of the customer service.<//Text>

<user_name>Nathan Copeland Wilson< /user_name><Review>Absolutely worst experience with any shop I have ever visited. Took my bike in for a head gasket, when I came back to pick up the bike, they started my bike in front of me and my friend who had given me a ride there, without any oil in it! The engine grenades itself in front of my eyes. Came back today to figure out what they were going to do about my engine, and they told me they never started it! Told me that I was trying to steal from them, and I just wanted money! What!?!

Then, while I was talking with them they told me they never even replaced the head gasket! They replaced the valve cover gasket. The work ordered clearly states that the head gasket was replaced, and thats what I paid for!

NEVER TRUST YOUR BIKE WITH THESE PEOPLE! I am now going to be taking them to court, but it will take months before I see anything out of it, and those months missing my bike will be the worst months of my life.</Review>< time>

Best park within a 35 mile radius.

Great for walking, running, and picnics.

Cons;

-People sometimes let their dogs roam free and they might bark and chase after one!

-Construction has been going on FOREVER.</text>

There are not too many places to spent your free time at Mountain House. This park is one of them. It has nice kids play grounds, facilities, manicured green areas, etc. Place could be windy, so you can try your site there.</Review>

It's a good park, could probably use a bit more shade, since Mountain House gets so hot.  The Water Feature is a blast and all the kids really tend to enjoy it.<//text>

Living in the Bay Area, I needed a birthday gift for my son's girlfriend who lives in Truckee.  I wanted to support a local shop during the Covid 19 shut down so my son suggested Bespoke.  Heather was fantastic and very patient as she sent me photos of products that were not all posted on the website.  Once I choose the item, she set it out for curb side pick up.  My son said it was beautifully wrapped and Heather even filled out the card with  my personal message.  I encourage anyone needing a gift to reach out to Bespoke.  And I hope, Heather, you get to safely open soon.< /text>

Bespoke is my favorite shop in Truckee for unique gifts for my friends and family. These guys carry a ton of interesting and artistic handmade items for men, women, and kids, including, jewelry, clothes, home decor, stationary, gift cards, necklaces, earrings, beard oil, candles, books, ceramic mugs, you name it!<//Review>

<Review>This shop is adorable and has lots of unique gifts. I was shopping for myself that day so I ended up purchasing a new pair of sunglasses. I love them & one of the shop owners was helpful in helping me choose bc I was there solo.< /Review>< Date>

<text>Bespoke is one of very few places I would drive an hour and a half to experience. My lady and I happened to wander in years ago and have been enamored with the space since. We make weekend trips to Truckee just for an excuse to go there. It's so easy to tell that the owners take their reputation for taste,  uniqueness, and supreme quality very seriously. I wish all shops existed at this level. I can't think of a place I would recommend more to anyone.</text><UserId.>117056384706879320487<//UserId.><rate>5< /rate><Date>1519016404257</Date>< username>

Always have to stop in here when I'm in Truckee, they always have the most unique jewelry, ceramics, and art. I have discovered all of my favorite new jewellery artists from this store, and super friendly staff.</review>

<Text>My daughter and I visited Bespoke on Saturday, November 25 to support small business Saturday in Truckee.  While in the store I reached into my sweater pocket for my glasses, to have a better look at some merchandise.  When I placed my eyeglasses back in my pocket I noticed Brian Hess watching me.    Upon exiting the store, Brian came to me on the sidewalk and asked what I placed in my pocket, he wanted to know if I took a key chain from his store.  I then emptied my pockets, showing him the only thing in my pocket was my eyeglasses.  Brian then apologized,  which did not reflect any sincerity on his part at all.   Brian, you should be ashamed of yourself. Accusations of this nature should not be made in public with bystandard all around.  This whole experience was very embarrassing for me and my daughter as bystandards watched this event unfold. I am a local resident, and have visited this store numerous times,. I now will NEVER visit this store again.  I gave this store one star as the system does not allow anything lower. Beware potential shoppers, this business sees all  customers as potential shoplifters.<//Text>< Pics>

{'time': 1511847671590, 'text': 'Dear Lisa,  I am very sorry you were accused of shoplifting in our shop. While this does not in any way excuse what happened to you, Friday was a very hard day for us in terms of shoplifting. I can certainly understand your embarrassment at being accused in public of something so far from your character. I am not replying to your review in any attempt to change your mind or ask you to remove it. I am replying to your review in hopes of making amends with you personally. Both Heather and I would like to extend our most sincere apologies for my actions on Saturday, no excuses, it was wrong, out of character and completely fueled by a different situation. While we understand you will not be patronizing our business, we hope you can except our apology, and know that we know there was a huge mistake made.\nWe wish you a wonderful winter!\nBrian Hess & Heather River'}<//response>

<time>1619453635926< /time><Rating>5<//Rating><text>Ramon and Eduardo are the best. Walking into the Inglewood site feels like your entering one of your favorite friends home. Those two Gentlemen are the two I worked with. The entire sales personnel were outstanding and very friendly, they also made sure safety comes first.👍up to the Inglewood family.I wasn't forced or harassed by anyone.This is not my first go around with the Inglewood office it's my 2nd and there's some different people and changes,but the best thing that haven't changed is dealing with friendly people, funny people, understanding people, nice and respectful people. This office is my friendly family business. 👪love them they keep you smiling at all times.
SO SORRY VROOM CAR GURU ETC. I LIKE DOING MY BUSINESS OLDSCHOOL.I like to know who I'm dealing with..also office is very clean all over.
When your handling business and your glucose starts to drop or you have to check your blood pressure and your sales manager goes into his pocket to make sure you dnt pass out and give you time out of there time to check your BP(blood pressure)it's a blessing and that's with them not knowing if your going to buy or not.
👍👍👍👍Ramon and Eduardo appreciate people like you. Inglewood office will always be the best. Better than the corporate and El Monte offices those are the other 2 that I have dealt with.
God Bless to you guys
He has blessed me with both you. If the Inglewood office ever closes that would be my last time dealing your company.

If you are going to finance a car and you do not have social security or itin number, this is a good place, but it is also a dealer that has very high car prices and a lot of interest, I got a car valued at 6,000 dollars less than the price I got and  I am not satisfied with the car, I really would not recommend this dealer and I think I will return my car no matter what happens, with the money that I pay at this dealer almost 500 dollars a month for a car from 2016 with that money I could have a better  car, find out very well if you want to buy here, I think they talk to you a lot and confuse you.< /text>

Worst Place for a car dealer. I bought a car and 2 months later I had to spend $1600 to fix it. Then they do not report your credit to all 3 Credit bureau. There also picky about what kind of insurance you get.  Most ridiculous dealer ever. As well they didn’t report 2 payments and my credit dropped 32 point. When I have had perfect payments

Never recommending this dealer!!!<//review>

Excellent service. They were all very friendly. I'm happy with the car they helped me finance. The process was very simple. The friendliness of the sellers was very different from other places where they just try to sell any car. They helped me find a car with which I am satisfied and very happy. Thanks to Ana for all your help and kindness.< /Text>

Not only is this place over priced but their cars are damaged asf, their mechanic is even worst, he put a hole thru our oil filter had to get that fixed, and that was a week within purchasing the car, they send me letters with different people name along with mines, they tell you you can return the car within a month but that's all bogus, their interest rates are ridiculous !

HORRIBLE PLACE TO BUY A CAR! BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE! When u have a problem with your car they DONT KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT CARS they send u different numbers/people to call and its still pointless! They also get u by having to pay TWICE A MONTH telling you "it will build your credit up fast" BS use that "TWICE" a month payment elsewhere and pay half of that in a month and STILL GET UR CREDIT UP FASTER theyre cars are overpriced! N all messed up! Just wait for a few months not even a year to find out< /Review>

(Translated by Google) You win car "TRANSEANDO" to the community!
I had a very BAD experience
And they told me that I couldn't return the car. That's a lie. I got a lawyer. If he helped me, the secret is not to stop paying, because then the Unicoi who could help me are called against you.
CONSUMER ACTION LAW GRUP
They can help you return the car and get all your money back!

(Translated by Google) I do not recommend doing business with this dealer. I paid for more than two years for my car without falling behind on payments in the hope of making the long-awaited credit in this country and they did not comply, in the internal application of the dealer they wrote my social security but In the database it was only filled with 11111111 when I called sperian to ask there was no report of desire to my name. A total fraud and that is because they sell you an overpriced used car with reference to the blue book and when you realize you try to return it they threaten that your credit will be ruined ... !!! If this is the case of someone else, check the credit first, if there is no report, return it immediately, it does not affect them at all.

No recomiendo hacer negocios con este dealer.. pague durante más de dos años mi carro sin atrazarme en los pagos  con la esperanza de hacer el tan soñado crédito en este país y ellos no cumplieron, en la aplicación interna del concesionario escribieron mi seguro social pero en la base de datos aparecía relleno solo con 11111111 cuando llamé a sperian para preguntar no había ningún reporte de ganas a mi nombre. Un fraude total y eso es porque te venden un carro usado sobre  valorado con referencia al libro azul y cuando te das cuenta lo tratas de devolver te amenazan que se te va a arruinar el crédito... !!! Si este es el caso de alguien más verifiquen el crédito primero si no hay ningún reporte devuelvanlo de inmediato no les afecta en nada ..< /Text>

(Translated by Google) Do not waste time and money! This company is loans, with a high price, with fortnightly payments. For example, a vehicle valued at 18,000, wanted 27,000, with payments of 614.00 per month for 48 months, a total of 34,000! That is why they do not announce the price, or payments, or interest, in their advertising! A total robbery! 😱 Very nice latin people, the positive! Thank you! 🤔😟😟

(Translated by Google) Watch out !!!!!!!!!!!!
It is one of the worst experiences that the very friendly and very attentive saleswoman has given me, but after two other people helped her to assist me, they assured me that the car was inspected at 150 inspection points, which is a fraud 10 hours after the car was no longer I turned on it did not start the second day that I found more problems I told him that I no longer wanted the car and the manager told me that he could not deliver it I found out online that in California you can return a used car within 10 days and they do not want to live the car Oliver the manager told me that I am not a mechanic and that I can not assure that the car has a problem although it does not start and they are sending me to a mechanic on a date that has already passed 10 days so I will no longer be able to return the car now I transport in uber it is very unfair and very low what these people do not be fooled these people say fraud when selling cars in poor condition well that is just my experience maybe it is just me but have cu ripped

<name>Shawn Eby< /name><review>Often sells outdated food. Bought 12 packs of Pepsi here with spider nests under the cans. Expiration date of 2013. Same with soup from 2015. Didn't realize til got home and soda tastes rancid. Went back to store after closing left all my spoiled food in front door of the store. Bought the only things not spoiled are beer and cigarettes. Anything else likely may kill you or make you sick.<//review><time>1540408149187<//time></record></dataset><record>

Wow. The tea salad and green papaya salad were absolutely amazing. We would live to get that again. We also loved the coconut rice and basil chicken. I would skip the shrimp dish next time though. Definitely coming back again!< /review>

This place had great authentic food and wasn't too crowded on a Saturday night. We made reservations and they were really accommodating for 12 people.

The tea leaf salad is a must, it's mainly nuts and it's really savory. It's something really unique you should try if you've never had it before. They had a variety of spicy levels but we got non-spicy since some people in our party are not a big fan of spicy food. The food was really great even though it didn't have heat to it! The roti was great, really thick yet soft and the dipping sauce it came with had great flavor.

The samosas were probably one of my favorite dishes, really flavorful and crunchy! We ordered several chicken and beef dishes as well as a few noodle dishes. I was impressed with each one that I tried and would definitely recommend this place to people in the area. I've tried several great Burmese places in SF and I would definitely count this restaurant as a favorite.<//review>

Service was great, food was fresh and tasty. We ordered papaya salad, the pancake and curry, veggie samosa, mandalay special noodle.  Perfect amount of food for two very hungry people. Oh and don’t skip dessert even if you’re full!! The black sticky rice was perfect way to end the meal. Outdoor seating but heaters and barriers provided that also blocks the wind, and a very clean space.< /text>

This restaurant is amazing.  Now that I no longer live in SF I don't get to come here as often.  When I do come out to the city I HAVE to come to Mandalay.  I get an order of special noodles to eat there and 2 orders to go. The pan fried string beans are also amazing!</Review>

Presentation gets 5 stars for sure, and bonus points for providing each table with a bottle of hand sanitizer as they seat you. They are very mindful of sanitizing and proper table distancing with the outdoor seating.

If you happen to be in the neighborhood and are looking for some Burmese food, this place will be fine.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None</resp><gmapID>0x8085873c9a913065:0x788e4b120aaaa7d5<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Review>First time here & ordered lunch special (Mandalay chicken & Burmese noodle) & regular dishes (ginger salad & Burmese style curry with prawn). Everything tasted delicious & seasoning right on spot, not too salty, sweet, etc. Pretty impressed with the ginger salad. Will definitely be back if around the area. Price is reasonable with great customer service.</Review>< Pics>

Been a Very long time since I have eaten here. Still excellent!

Mandalay chicken and samusas are my favorites! The Rainbow salad was very tasty. The Salt and Pepper shrimp was perfectly cooked.

🍺 selection is pretty good. The Sierra Nevada IPA went well with the food.

Definitely come back again!< /Review>

Burma Love and Burma Superstar get all the glory in SF, and to be sure, they are very good. But Mandalay Restaurant is my Burmese bae. Everything I've had here at the city's oldest Burmese restaurant has just been so incredibly, aggressively flavorful (but in the best way possible) and delicious. My top choices are the spicy smoked pork with cabbages, the prawns with green beans, the papaya salad, the fried squash sticks, and the Mandalay special noodles. The prices are also super reasonable. It's one of my favorite restaurants in a pretty stacked Inner Richmond scene.<//Review>

Good mom and pop Burmese restaurant among options in the area. Food is a bit more home style with good variety. Very friendly and accommodating staff. The ginger lemonade and Mandalay house special noodles are must tries.</review>

<text>We had an AMAZING office lunch delivered by Kevin of Mandalay and could not have been more grateful and impressed! Kevin made organizing the lunch a breeze, first suggesting menu items, then working with us to customize, then (by our sixth call 😇 and still as patient as ever) coordinating delivery. On delivery day, he was punctual and even mixed the mandalay special noodles in person! How’s THAT for service 🤯 to top it off, everything was absolutely DELICIOUS. Thank you Kevin and Mandalay!</text>< Response>

Just not as good as Burma Superstar.

I love the idea of finding a Burmese place that's as tasty as Burma Superstar with less of the wait, but I just haven't been able to do it. This one is good, it's just not that same level.

Highlights: balada (esp the curry dipping sauce), rainbow salad, rangoon lamb (so tender!)

The staff is friendly and I'd probably come back if I was in the area, but not when I'm hitting a real craving.<//Review>

A Burmese restaurant tucked away, didn't try a lot of different dishes, the tea leaf salad surprised me as there was no other greens! Not sure if this is more authentic, but I'm more used to the Burma Superstar tea leaf salad. The final presentation after it was mixed up, definitely was not the most appetizing. The crispy chicken was truly unique and the presentation was artistic. The coconut rice was with coconut flavor which I thought was well done! And on each table, there's a dish of spice!<//Text>

< Review>
Really enjoyed the food. This place is apparently the original Burmese restaurant in SF. A lot of the decor felt authentic and we enjoyed the overall feel. The service was awkward and forced. They kept asking if I was ready to order about every minute to 45 seconds. Felt a little pushy to get some other stuff on the menu too. We had the chicken curry and their noodle dish. The curry was succulent and the noodle dish was even better than the sister store of the famous Burmese Star imo. Amazing mix of textures and flavors. Notes of bay leaf wafted and was almost freshly aromatic as your chewing, but the coconut chicken with noodles felt like comfort food. If you like Thai, Indian, or Burmese, this is a must try in SF. Would give a 3.7 if I could, or a 4.5 if the service wasn’t so awkward.</Review>

<Rating>5</Rating><Text>This Burmese restaurant has one of the best Tea Leaf salads in the city. I recently discovered this place post COVID and I am impressed by the food and also the staff. The restaurant is currently offering outdoor seating and the staff tries very hard to give you a great dining experience. When I went to eat at this restaurant, it was very cold and windy outside. The staff brought out portable heating lamps and even a dividing wall to protect our table from the wind. They kept checking in on us to ensure that we were comfortable. Overall their customer service was great.

Now on to the food, I've tried their tea leaf salad, rainbow chicken, garlic noodles and mango sticky rice.  Every plate was delicious and the portions are perfect for two people. I believe this restaurant was even Michelin rated a few years back. I am glad that I discovered this place but I wish I had found it sooner!<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

Great food. It would have been nicer to have more veggie options. I really loved the Burmese fried rice. The Burmese iced tea wasn't that good. The togu curries and samusa salad was super!
The ambience is great and cute. The people are really nice. I guess because the food is great and place is great, it's always crowded :)</review>

Some of the best service I've ever seen in a restaurant. Attentive, friendly, helpful, creative, aware, and very quick - these folks really have it dialed in. Our wait staff understood all aspects of pescatarian, vegetarian, and vegan at our table, and was very clear and helpful as to each specific dish and what modifications could be made.

Food: anywhere from pretty good to excellent, depending on the dish - with bonus points for novelty since I rarely eat Burmese. It seems they fry their own tofu which makes a world of difference.

Decor: dated but authentic. Someone taking care of the Orchids up front really knows what they're doing.< /Text>

One time the wait at burma superstar was insane, that's how we found this restaurant just a street away from it and it became our second favorite. Their burmese food is class, samusa soup and the rainbow salad are some of my favorites.</review>

Been to quite a few Burmese restaurants and this one didn’t hit the mark for us. The food was a overall good, but when you order two of the same thing and you get two different items, then get told they’re the same thing it just doesn’t make us want to go back. If you do come here I recommend ride share since parking is a pain in this neighborhood.</text>

Nyona is % amazing. Everything is done well, and if you're looking to be adventurous (frog legs or stingray anyone?) this is the place to spread your wings. You will not be disappointed.< /Review>< Pictures>

So impressed!  I came out with a group of 7, and with a collection of food restrictions. Our waiter carefully catered to all of our needs, made suggestions, and helped us craft our orders--including an off the menu dish. All of the servers were great and very attentive. The food was absolutely delicious! I highly recommend.<//review>

We had an AMAZING office lunch delivered by Kevin of Mandalay and could not have been more grateful and impressed! Kevin made organizing the lunch a breeze, first suggesting menu items, then working with us to customize, then (by our sixth call 😇 and still as patient as ever) coordinating delivery. On delivery day, he was punctual and even mixed the mandalay special noodles in person! How’s THAT for service 🤯 to top it off, everything was absolutely DELICIOUS. Thank you Kevin and Mandalay!<//Review>

This little restaurant serves up some amazing food. Be sure to get the Tea Leaf Salad and the Plata Dip Starter. Get there early because they don't take reservations and the line builds up quickly.<//Text>

<review>I absolutely adore this place. Two of my favorite dishes: glazed deep-fried eggplant and volcano beef. The beef is not on the menu, but they have never turned me away when I've ordered it. It's a slightly spicy, slightly sweet, touch of cumin maybe?, incredibly tender beef with peppers and onions. The eggplant is cut into huge chunks with a sugar-crisp fried outer and moist, almost airy center. Also a touch spicy. Those are just the entrees. Two other favorites are the balada and samusa salad. The balada is basically a paratha, an light, flaky flat bread served with a gingery curry sauce. I like to smear a few spoonfuls of the chili paste, top it with curry sauce, and fold it like a pizza to eat. The samusa salad is a lovely mix of textures and flavors. You get crispy samusa and batter-fried veggies mixed with fresh veggies, dressed in a slightly sour, slightly sweet tamarind dressing. I could easily just eat balada and samusa salad for dinner (split with someone else because the portions are generous). Add this to your dining bucket list.</review>< Pictures>

<Text>This place is THE BOMB. Back in the day when they were open for dine in, we had nothing but good experiences. Great food, great service. Beautiful orchids everywhere. Get the Tea Leaf salad (it's not traditionally served with romaine but I just ask them to add it) and jasmine tea (the tea is such an experience, they drop this ball of dried up tea ingredients into hot water and it slowly opens up while it steeps)

We have gotten take out from them twice since the shelter in place and everything is packaged so nicely. The Nan Gyi Dok noodle dish is amazing. Haven't ordered a thing we didn't like yet!<//Text>< Pictures>

Delicious so most likely will be back for the food, but disappointed with the service. Maybe it was an off day since we have been they are a long time ago and they were great.

We came with her two young kids, less than 4 years old and clearly we're getting antsy so we asked for the check. The couple that was next to us who came in after us got their check and left before us. The staff either forgot us or thought someone else was getting it, but they cleared all our plates. We eventually took our kids outside and I sat there by myself waiting for the check. Mind you this was at 4p so they weren't even fully packed or that busy.

They also don't know what slow cooked meat is and when I asked them how a recipe was prepared they didn't understand. next time I will look at Google pictures and show them which one I want but their menu doesn't have many pictures of the main entrees.

Lastly, I really dislike places that assume kids can't eat off of real plates and give them plastic forks and spoons to eat noodles. The fork bends when the kids try to eat so they end of using their hands. Paper plates and plastic cups are also annoying since the children think they're toys because they're not heavy like the plates they are used to and the straws are paper so they dissolve in the kid's mouth when they chew on them. The worst part is that the cups are taller than their head so when they tilt them to drink all the water comes out of the straw hole. I understand that some kids are poorly behaved and might break a plate or cup but the majority of children don't because they're used to either food on real plates with real forks.</Review>

Some, very friendly waiters and the food was decent. However, I had such a disappointing night due to poor management.
My family of 20 made a reservation for Saturday night at 6pm. A few of us arrive fifteen minutes early and we asked for the table. During our wait for the rest of our family to arrive, we were"warned" twice if not enough of our people shows up, they will give our table away, and that was 5:50pm.
When all of us arrived (at 6pm), our table was flooded with food and it won't stop coming until we ask them to slow down, the answer they gave us was "No we can't slow down because we are very busy!".
Overall, I never felt so unwelcome in a restaurant. I do hope the place will improve their attitude toward large group reservation.< /review>

First time to taste Burmese food and it didn't disappoint. Tastes somewhere between Thai & Chinese cuisine actually. Place is exquisite and adorned with Burmese artwork.. much to find from the ceiling to the walls. Highly recommending this. Parking could be a problem though.

Accessibility ♿ Review: PWD-friendly. 💯< /Review>

Ordered the Mandalay Eggplant with Fried Eggplant and Balada as appetizers. Both appetizers tasted amazing. The entree was good but nothing extraordinary. I didn't like the fact that it was on the sweet side. Service was fast and the waiters were very polite excluding one of them that kept wanting to wipe the table while we were still there and there were plates on it. I would recommend this place. I would also come back and try something else.</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

Go with a group and share so that you can experience the terrific flavors of more of Mandalay's subperb Burmese dishes. Very attentive servers.  As we were leaving one of the staff entered the dining room to thank us for dining at the restaurant.  Thank you Mandalay for a great meal and a very nice dining experience.< /text>< Pics>

The food was awesome.
The place was very busy on a Sat evening.
Took quite some time to get a table and the cooks must have been feeling the workload as it took a while for the food to be served< /text>

<Text>Just plain delicious. I know there are a few popular Burmese restaurants in the neighborhood, but this is most definitely the best. Never have I been disappointed with the service or food. Although their coconut rice is incredible, the saffron rice is an equally delicious alternative.  I could go on an on, but you should experience this for yourself. There can be a wait, but well worth it.</Text><pics>None<//pics><response>None< /response>< gmap_id>

Everytime we've gone there, management is so eager to kick you out.  We went yesterday and asked our waitress for dessert (coconut ice cream and phaluda).   She acknowledged the order and stated they had those items.  Manager came a few minutes later and said they didn't have those items.  This has happened 4-5 times now.< /Review>

Crowded, popular, tasty Burmese place in a busy neighborhood. I liked the decor a lot, very cozy. Food was very good - I ordered an appetizer and a main dish and both were really good. Arrive early for the dinner rush, as the place is small and seating is limited. Staff was very attentive.</text>

<Rate>5<//Rate><text>Rumor has it that Mandalay is the first Burmese restaurant in San Francisco, if not in the Bay, and it remains the best. It strikes the perfect balance of flavor, ambience, and accessibility that can't be found anywhere else. It sets the standard for perennial favorites tea leaf salad and samusa soup while providing options no other place seems to carry like the Mandalay eggplant.

Accepts reservations for parties 5 or more. Don't have 5? Invite your friends, mother-in-law, frenemies, me!…b/c this place gets packed during rush hours.

Pro: the staff is attentive and knowledgeable about vegan dishes
Con: the upsell game is strong< /text>< user_id>

<Rate>5</Rate><Review>My favorite Burmese restaurant in the city: the waits are not as crazy as the other places and the food has always been deliciously dependable.

My favorite (and therefore always ordered) items:
1.  Rainbow Salad: there are twenty ingredients in this thing, and together they make a divine dish.  I could eat this for a meal alone if it were just me.
2.  Mandalay Special Noodle:  normally I'm not a huge coconut fan, but it works in this dish.  The cooked noodles and the crunchy noodles complement each other in texture, and the chicken is always tender and nicely flavored.
3.  Mango chicken:  the sauce on the chicken is so delicious.  The mango chunks aren't always the sweetest, but that's not always a bad thing given it's a savory dish.
4.  Dry pan-fried string beans with tofu: just get them.  Seriously.
5.  Also have tried the tea leaf salad, which is also good, but I still prefer the rainbow salad.  Will order if I want to change it up.

True, the portions do leave something to be desired, but I suppose it prevents me from eating too much to the point of bursting.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None</Resp><Gmap_id>0x8085873c9a913065:0x788e4b120aaaa7d5</Gmap_id></record>

Great food in a nice cozy restaurant.

Probably hard to fit more than 6 people, so if you have a big party keep that in mind.

Additionally, if you ask for hot tea they'll give you a fancy jasmine tea that costs a couple of dollars (not a bad thing, just didn't expect that - expected a regular tea pot and cups like other Asian restaurants)</Review>

<Rating>1<//Rating><Review>I ate at Burma Star when it first opened years ago.  Wasn't impressed.   After many years of hearing friends' raves, we tried it again.   Even less impressed!  The vegetarian dishes we ordered were heavily spiced with too much salt, garlic and chili.  When we inquired about dishes without MSG, we were told there were about 4 vegetarian items on the menu that didn't contain this food additive.   Don't they realize many people are allergic?  All in all, we were very unhappy with our shared dishes at this relatively high end restaurant.   We're heading back to the nearby Burmese restaurant that has been a family main stay for 40 years.  Thanks but no thanks,  Burma Star!</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

This is our ABSOLUTE favorite Burmese restaurant hands down, no other can compare to the taste of this food! I know other Burmese restaurants get huge praises, that's only because they have not experienced Mandalay. We have eaten at one of the popular ones that ends in "Super ", what a HUGE disappointment!! We go to Mandalay full of anticipation of a good meal and so far we have not been disappointed. The tea leaf salad is an experience of a lifetime,  it's like a symphony in your mouth!! The wait in line is worth it!!!!<//review>

Every dish they have on the menu has been my favorite! Loooove this place. Try it, you won’t be disappointed. The only thing that sucks is parking...but you know what they say, good things happen to people who wait...it’s so worth it!</Review>< Pictures>

One of my favorite Burmese restaurants is right around the corner, but I think I may have found a new favorite. Mandalay easily took us (a group of 11) and made us feel comfortable. Every single thing we ordered was delicious and visually stunning. My sangria was probably one of the best things I ordered there! The rainbow salad was amazing, so was the tea leaf salad. The coconut rice is great. We ordered so many things that I can't even remember. Basically, I really don't think you can go wrong with anything you order. Enjoy!< /review></record></dataset><record>

First time there. We went with my brorher in law and his girlfriend. This was a delightful surprise. The food was good. The service was friendly. The waiter understood immediately what we meant by gluten and lactose free so he recommended without hesitation what we could have. That was huge for us. He was savvy about health concerns. They were pretty busy but he didn't make us feel rushed. Try it.< /Review>

<text>Great location and decor, and decent Burmese cuisine. Good thing we didn't drink. While the food was good, it was served in small amounts.  You would think a $21 entree of beef would be at least enough for two to share, but there was hardly any beef in it. Mostly inexpensive sweet peppers and an inexpensive sprig of mint on top. Looked great and tasted great, but not worth the price. Since then, we have a much better venue over in Newark that treats you much better.< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

<text>Went for lunch.  Fabulous service.  Had two off menu items, Bang Bang Seafood & Mango Chicken, both were delicious. The Burmese iced tea was not to my taste but others may enjoy it, likewise with the tea leaf salad, which gets final preparation at your table which is fun.  Hope to return.< /text>< pics>

<text>This is one of my favorites in SF.  It has incredible Burmese food, a friendly staff, and is down the block from one of the most amazing antique shops I've seen.  Their ginger salad is a lightly dressed ingredients such as peanuts, jalapeno, sesame seeds, cabbage, fried shrimp and more.  Other favorites are Basil Eggplant, Sizzling Prawns with their signature coconut rice.  Love this pmace.</text>< Rating>

We got the last table on a Friday night and there was a small line when we left.

The veg food we got was really good (though overall I don't think Burmese is usually as good as Thai) and the server was well-versed in what was and wasn't veg, so that was nice. The service overall was very good, with essentially a large ensemble cast of friendly and mostly attentive servers, so we never had to wait for "our" server because of any of the employees was willing to help with anything, which made everything run smoother.<//text>

Colorfully decorated and illuminated with a table of fruit offerings to a small Buddha near the entrance and small booths in the center and tables along the sides. We sat in a booth and were greeted almost immediately by a very friendly, Chinese waitress. The somewhat kitchy ambiance and attentive service were the high points of the evening.
We were looking forward to ordering a Tea Leaf Salad, but both the picture and the description looked far too "nutty" for our tastes. The online menu listed an Indian Naan bread, but it is not available, so we ordered a Balada (Burmese pancake) which we all enjoyed despite the non-descript sauce/gravy that accompanied it.
I was curious to try a Burmese curry and ordered a shrimp curry, only to discover that it really wasn't a curry at all. It came with a bland tomato and onion sauce, in no way similar to an Indian, Thai, or Chinese curry.  Our waitress informed me that that the chicken or beef curry was a more traditional, spicy curry, but curry lovers should take warning. One of my Chinese friends who had recent dental work ordered a plate of noodles which seemed either too soft or overcooked, which in this case may have been fortunate. My other Chinese friend ordered the Szechuan Beef which was clearly the best tasting dish on the table, although it was not very spicy even though it featured lots of green and red peppers.
I confess we had come to Mandala because we wanted to eat Burmese food at Pagan Restaurant on Clement and 33rd, but it was closed. Frankly  while the interior of Mandalay was far more inviting than Pagan, the food was disappointing. It was also far less Burmese. Pagan appears to be something of a family run Burmese operation with Burmese and Thai food, while Manadaly appears to be a Burmese restaurant with Burmese and Chinese food with a largel;y Chinese staff.</text>< Pictures>

<Text>Been coming here for years always loved the food so fresh...don't know if my tastebuds changed but the curry noodles and veggie egg rolls were extremely greasy. I was so surprised and disappointed..big change never had anything greasy before.

The hidden Burmese food gem of San Francisco. Don't be fooled by the hype.
There's nothing wrong with Burma Superstar, except the endless lines and tiny dining room.
Mandalay is more than twice the size, and just as good.
My personal favorite is the 'birds nest seafood delight' which is a seafood and vegetable stir fry served in a crispy, edible bowl, but everything I've tried there has been good, especially the tea leaf salad!
This is also a great place to take vegetarians, as there's a wide variety of options available for them.
They also offer both chopsticks and forks automatically, in case you're not comfortable with chopsticks.
There's also several interesting and tasty drink options (as well as the classic young coconut) and a wine menu.

Go two blocks off Clement, away from the crazy wait times, and get food that's far better in my mind.<//Text>

Solid food but left a little to be desired. The soup was served warm and the pumpkin curry had pieces of pumpkin that felt out of place. The ginger drink was very intense in bitterness, sweetness, and acidity. I cannot deny how charming the place looks though.< /review>

Went for dinner with a group of 4.  I've never had Burmese but it was delicious. The tea leaf salad was amazing and the Burmese lamb curry was very tender. The service was a bit off. Felt like the server was more interested in getting our drink orders in then getting our food out.<//review>

<review>Such an amazing Burmese/Mandarin restaurant!! If you're a fan of Burma Superstar or Burma Love, this is the place for you. The line goes a lot faster and while service is a little slow, the food is FANTASTIC. The tea leaf salad is quite unique with a blend of several different spices and flavors, and the lamb curry / rainbow chicken is delicious. I also highly recommend the Mandalay Special Noodle- it's light, savory curry with a mild spice is addicting.< /review>< username>

Excellent service and environment. Modern, fresh and comfortable. The food quality is definitely on the top level. Nevertheless some of the dishes are somehow awkward in terms of food combinations. I can't understand the 3* M rating! For this price level disappointing and not recommended. There are better places in SFO</Text>

<Text>We have been faithful diners at the Mandalay for over twenty years and we have always had wonderful dining experiences.  The food is excellent and the wait staff is attentive.  Our favorite dishes are Mandalay Special Noodles, Mandalay Chicken and Ginger Salad.  We haven't found a Burmese restaurant that comes close to the Mandalay for excellence.<//Text>< gmapID>

Amazing food and great service. I definitely recommend coming here for an authentic experience. It's busy but not crowded like the other Burmese places in town...</Text>

< review>
I have to dock a couple of stars from my last review.

They placed my party at this table which was awkwardly placed next to another (imagine two square tables and one of them rotated into a diamond).  I know they're pressed for space, but this was ridiculous.

I noticed that the prices went up, which isn't a surprise living here in the city.  I ordered the sizzling rice soup, which by all accounts was delicious and satisfied my craving for something warm.  My roommate ordered lamb, but was given chicken.  It took awhile to flag a waiter down to correct the order.  My other roommate wanted more vegetables in her dish and was told to order a side of vegetables instead.  Plus she was told it was pre-made, which makes me wonder how much of their food is just waiting under heat lamps...

I hope the owners/management get together soon because it would be a shame if they closed.  The food is really good, especially the string beans.  But if service continues this way, and prices go up, no one is going to line up to eat here.  And I say that because that is usually the norm.  I was surprised we got a table right away, and surprised there weren't groups of people waiting after we left.<//review>

Amazing Burmese food. I was expecting the tea leave salad to have veggies in it but it was all nuts lentils tea leaves and seeds. Ok if you weren't actually expecting leafy salad. Everything was delicious. Make sure to wear expandable top pants/dresses. Not a place you'd want to take first date unless you don't mind sharing your ugly-eat face or not wanting to share your food. Imho, best Burma place in the city.</Text>

Very friendly and attentive service. The dishes weren't fancy but were very good. 👌

Fair warning: you can expect reasonably long waits given its popularity.< /text>

I've tried their: Balada, Mango Chicken, Volcano Beef, Tea leaf salad Mandalay Noodles and Tapioca Coconut Drink.

There is truly nothing like it in LA. Best of both worlds (Indian/Thai).< /Review>< pictures>

Best restaurant in the bay. From the tacky decore to the delicious food, Mandalay transports you to the other side of the world and back. The tea leaf salad, paratha, Mandalay special noodles, Mandalay chicken, and samosa soup are my favorites. Garlicky goodness awaits.<//Text>

Awful experience. Food was great but had the same items as any other Burmese restaurants. After we paid AND tipped for our meal and decent service, as we were leaving, they stopped us to tell us they forgot to charge us for an item. We were thinking they were going to give us that item for free as we had already had paid. Nope, they brought an extra bill for the item they forgof to charge intially. What a low class act. You forgot to charge the item and you wait to inform us as we were leaving.</review>

Great Burmese comfort food, friendly staff. They were able to accommodate our party of 13 with ease. A great time was had by everyone, we never felt rushed, they helped us sing happy birthday too!</Review>

<review>Made reservations for a family of 7 for 730pm.  Did not sit till 758pm.  Saw no point in making reservations as we waiting as long as walk ins. My family was not happy about that.  Just like other reviews stated the portions was small for family servings.  I should of caught on to when the waiter is trying to upsell more dishes.   The price is a bit much for the lack of quantity.  I do admit the food is tasty.  Especially the volcano beef and string beans.  But falls short due to the quantity and high price.  The waiters and waitresses are nice. One of them did get my drink wrong and forgot to bring the right one out.  I guess if I was supposed to come back here would be on a date when I'm on a calorie deficit diet.  Besides that I'd rather go to my cheap Chinese restaurant SUILYs in DC where I can get bigger portions for my money.< /review>< UserId.>

<Review>Best restaurant in the bay. From the tacky decore to the delicious food, Mandalay transports you to the other side of the world and back. The tea leaf salad, paratha, Mandalay special noodles, Mandalay chicken, and samosa soup are my favorites. Garlicky goodness awaits.< /Review>< username>

Man I love this place! The Balada is one of my all-time favorite appetizers, such a delicious, buttery, flaky flatbread, super sumptuous curry dipping sauce! You can't go wrong with the tea leaf salad either, very unique if you aren't familiar with Burmese food. I always get both of those for my table, then share some mains too. Yum!<//review>

I went in a big group so we were able to order a number of dishes to try. Some standouts are: tea leaf salad, mango chicken, smoke tea duck, and mandalay special noodle.

Prices are very reasonable. This place gets really packed so be prepared to wait a bit. They offered complimentary red wine while you wait so I didn't mind waiting too much :)<//review>< pics>

Tasty Burmese food. Everything was good, but not mind blowing in any way. Portions were a bit on the small side. I'd go back if someone wanted to, but probably wouldn't choose it unless I had few other options.< /review>

Was really looking forward to trying the food but I stood there for a couple of minutes feeling awkward by myself because I was eating alone and two women walking in immediately get seated. So I left. Didn't think I looked so horrible that they couldn't give me a seat so I could spend my money there.<//text>

<Rate>5</Rate><Review>Went For: Sunday night dinner

The Vibe: Burmese cuisine that many people can get down with

Special Dish: Tea Salad, Fish Soup, Special Noodles

Avoid Their: n/a

Price Point: most big entrees are under $20.00 while small dishes are under $7.00

The Service: Great! The waiters are flexible and accommodating, and willing to help whenever

Reservations: I don't think they take, but do it if you can. By the time we left at 8:00pm, there was a line out of the door

FYI, FRIENDS: apparently you're not allowed to take pictures of the food, which def bums me out!

Eat up, Kimmie</Review>< pics>

<Text>Amazing food, especially for someone who happens to be vegetarian. Salads are amzing as well as spicy souses.

The restaurant is small and cozy. We usually go there with 4 to 6 people and they accomodate just fine.

The waiters are always friendly and helpful. Overall amazing experience.<//Text><pics>None</pics><UserId.>108428802519351175158< /UserId.>< gmap_id>

Ps. The dishes tasted of bleach/dishwasher soap.< /review></record></dataset><record>

Wonderful food - for all, Samusa soup is a must do as is the Tea Leaf Salad.
For veggies, you cannot go wrong with the rice dish or the spicy veggie dish.
Great decor and fun to eat at!< /Review>

< Review>
Mandalay has been open 26 years, and I've been eating there for 25. In my experience, it's the best Burmese restaurant in the City, with a mix of Burmese specialties and Chinese dishes. I eat only the Burmese, which can be thought of as a flavor mix of Thai, Indian, and Chinese with a special twist of its own. I especially recommend the Ginger Salad and Tampoi Rice. Weekends can be noisy.</Review>

<Review>Worst management ever.  Made a reservation, the table wasn't ready, and then crammed us into tables of different sizes.  The manager came over and said "we are busy here" and "order fast and stop arguing".  He said if we don't want to eat then we can leave.

We ended up eating because people were hungry but the manager should be fired.</Review></record>

<Review>This place has been a favorite for 20 years now. Maybe longer! Not Thai, not Vietnamese, not Chinese. Burmese has flavors and delicacies all its own. The service is consistently good, and the food is devine. You must start with lap pot dok, the tea salad. Mandalay chicken or shrimp is epic as are the soups. Pair with a cold Singha, the Thai beer and you will be on your way to nirvana! Be adventurous and try interesting menu items you might not normally try and you will be rewarded handsomely. Place is a winner. Great for a first date or a 50th anniversary.<//Review><pics>None</pics>< response>

< Review>
Went For: Sunday night dinner

The Vibe: Burmese cuisine that many people can get down with

Special Dish: Tea Salad, Fish Soup, Special Noodles

Avoid Their: n/a

Price Point: most big entrees are under $20.00 while small dishes are under $7.00

The Service: Great! The waiters are flexible and accommodating, and willing to help whenever

Reservations: I don't think they take, but do it if you can. By the time we left at 8:00pm, there was a line out of the door

FYI, FRIENDS: apparently you're not allowed to take pictures of the food, which def bums me out!

Eat up, Kimmie< /Review>

One of the worst restaurant experiences we have ever shared.  Arrive at about 3:30 pm, restaurant was empty except for about four people.  Ordered jasmine tea, which was priced at $5.00 each glass.  Ordered the chicken samosas and could not taste a piece of chicken.  Our main order, tea duck and mushu pork, took forever to arrive.  The duck was cold and had to be sent back.  The mushu pork was greasy and tasteless.  I left most of it on the plate.  Not once did anyone come by and inquire if we were satisfied with the service or the food.  These items, the two teas, the samosas, the duck and the mushu pork added up to almost $60.00, a total waste of money.   I would not recommend this place to my worst enemy.</Review>

Food is overpriced for the amount you get, for a small amount of coke it's $4 with no refills, on top of that the waiters speak zero English, goodluck explaining your food allergies. And they also don't split checks here, as the worker said "you put all on credit card"</text>

<review>Came in on a random Tuesday night and it was still packed - a good sign!

There's a clipboard inside for the wait list. We waited 20 minutes for a table for 3 (even with calling ahead). We got a small table meant for 2 but managed to squeeze and make it work. Servers were pleasant enough but seemed overwhelmed.

Food: Tea leaf salad was unique and delicious, mixed table sized after our server explained the ingredients. The other dishes were good but nothing amazing: mango chicken and curry beef.

Pro-tip: call 15 mins ahead and ask them nicely to add your name to the list.< /review><rate>3</rate><Pictures>None</Pictures>< GmapID>

Casual family-run atmosphere. Great tea leaf salad, rainbow salad, samosa soup and mandalay noodle. Love the chin mong jaw - sauteed sour vegetable and bamboo. It's very tasty if you like pickled vegetables.<//review>

Make a foray to the Mandalay. The tea leaf salad edged out the ginger salad only slightly - both were great. So was sobon soup, pea shoots and duck. But the Mandalay noodles and green beans were exceptional. No wonder it was crowded! $8 corkage.</review>

<Resp>None<//Resp><Text>This restaurant is one of the two best Burmese places of all time. The menu is varied, the cuisine spicy and fragrant, the wait staff chatty in the best possible way and the portions are large enough to guarantee leftovers.

If you've never tried Burmese food, this is the perfect start: expect a delicate blend of indian-style powdered curry/potatoes/peas with south-east asian curry pastes/noodles/fresh vegetables. Best dish: Mandalay Special Noodles.< /Text>< name>

We have been coming here for years & did not realize that we had not reviewed this. Mandalay is one of our favorite restaurants in the world. We always get great food & personalized warm service. I would mention that it gets busy, as we found this holiday season, so call them for reservations. They are not on Open Table anymore. The vegetarian & vegan  options are incredible. We love the had balada, samusa soup, tea leaf salad, ginger salad, walnut broccoli tofu, Mandalay special noodle, & coconut rice. The tofu kebat, Singapore noodles, & basil spicy eggplant are okay. The desserts & drinks are also great. Parking can be tough in the area.< /Text>

The best restaurant in San Francisco for locals!  The food is soooo good!!!  You can't go wrong on the menu. Myranmar (Burman) cuisine is a magical melding of Indian, Thai and Chinese cuisine.</Review>

<review>I've passed by Mandalay a few times, without realizing they're the sister restaurant to Mingalaba, which is easily my favorite Burmese restaurant in the Bay Area. On the suggestion of a friend, her boyfriend and I came here instead of Burma Superstar, and ordered the:

* Tea Leaf Salad - What Burmese meal is complete without one of these! As flavorful as the ones at Mingalaba, but a bit saltier, with some minor flavor differences, and also possibly smaller.

* Mandalay Special Noodles - I'm not sure if these are the same as the house noodles at Mingalaba, but quite similar in any case, and just as delicious.

* Mango Prawns - This was a bit of an odd order, but we wanted to diversify our protein a bit, and opted for seafood. Not a bad dish, but not exactly what I imagined (which was something more saucy), and a bit on the salty side, even when paired with rice.

So, be it due to poor memory, or actual difference in quality of the food, Mandalay wasn't as impressive as Mingalaba, but still good enough that it beats out having to wait in line at Burma Superstar.

***Accessibility Info***

Venue - The restaurant is quite a large space, so getting around isn't a problem.

Bathroom - Didn't check them out.</review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

<review>Wow! This rivals Burma IMHO. It was fairly crowded on a Thursday evening but we got a table within 15 min. The seafood rangoon is a must, as well as the braised pork served in whole kabocha squash (which made quite a lovely presentation). The seafood was tender and the sauce was tangy and flavorful. We opted for the rainbow salad over the ever popular tea leaf salad and next time I'll have to try it for comparison to Burma and San Mateo's Mingdalaba. Finally, Mandalay serves a coconut milk (shake?) that I'm still craving and can't find anywhere else. If they weren't so deep in SF's Inner Richmond, I'd be eating there once a week!</review>< pictures>

<Review>We came here to try their vegitarian Kaw Soi Dok (Burmese Style Noodle) it has a nice split pea, cucumber, fried tofu and tamarind sauce. For an extra $5 you get a side 'black pepper' soup that has a light fish broth with cucumber and winter mellon.
Personally I was more of a fan of their Mandalay Special Noodle which was made with fresh home made rice noodles and a light yellow coconut curry sauce with some tasty crunchy noodles and fried onion sprinkled on top. Yum!< /Review>< Pictures>

Most people know about Burma Superstar one block away, but this little hidden treasure is my favorite. The way Mandalay prepares the quintessential Burmese dish Laphet (tealeaf salad) is much more authentic than Burma Superstar. (I should know--I grew up in Rangoon, Burma.) At Mandalay, you get a generous dose of fermented tealeaf, with little or no green. That's the way it ought to be. My other favorite items on the menu are stir-fried sour leaves (Chinbaung), mango chicken, and Nan gyi thoke.</Text>

(Translated by Google) And if you would have 6 star 6 star. What a great place to eat. If you see him outside he does not throw much. We come on the recommendation of local friends. The drinks are different and very rich. Cooking water comes in which such coconut. Chicken soups with coconut and fish chowder are very rich. A being a table with several guests had opportunity to try dishes with meat, poultry, fish and shrimp with a delicious peanut. Special mention deserves a simply sensational pork belly. Coconut rice is delicious and noodles. Several of the dishes sting. The service meets without being good. That pleasant surprise and this place should be a "must" when visiting San Francisco.

Y si hubieran 6 estrellas le pondría 6 estrellas. Que buen lugar para comer. Si uno lo ve por fuera no se le arrojaría mucho. Venimos por recomendación de unos amigos locales. Las bebidas son diferentes y muy ricas. El agua de cocina viene en el coco tal cual. Las sopas de pollo con coco y el chowder de pescado son muy ricas. Al ser una mesa con varios comensales tuvimos oportunidad de probar platillos con carne se res, pollo, pescado y unos camarones con cacahuate deliciosos. Mención aparte merece un pork belly simplemente sensacional. El arroz con coco está delicioso así como los tallarines. Varios de los platillos pican. El servicio cumple sin llegar a ser bueno. Que agradable sorpresa y este lugar debería ser un "must"en las visitas a San Francisco.< /text>
