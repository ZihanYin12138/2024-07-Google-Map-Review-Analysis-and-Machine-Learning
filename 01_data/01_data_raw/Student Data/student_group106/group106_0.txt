While visiting this Lamps Plus in Brea, we were greeted and assisted by employee Jennifer.  Our visit and purchase turned into a wonderful experience due to Jennifer’s knowledge.  Jennifer was kind and very patient.  We were able to make our purchase and only wish all shopping experiences could be like this.< /text>

<review>Lamps Plus has a good selection of lamps but this location tends to have poor customer service. You always have to hunt somebody down to get help. None of their help ever recognizes you or asks if you need help.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

<rating>5< /rating><review>When our lamp broke, I really wanted to shop in person, not online. I was very impressed by Lamps Plus' selection, the way the lamps were sort of organized by style and color, and especially the space my sales person, Rachel, gave me to look before offering to help me. She was so helpful in finding out what was in stock--mine weren't--and ordering them to be shipped free of charge. To our surprise, the 3 lamps came the next day, and we love them.<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

<text>We place an order for a chandelier after Thanksgiving and they told us it will come and deliver to our house on Dec 5th or Dec 7. After 2 week I followed up the order and they told me that I will call them back after 2 days if I did not get update on the status of my order. I called them back after 5 days instead of two days and they told me that my order got push to end of January or early February. The one I’m upset no one from the store update me on the status of my order, my contractor is waiting I rescheduled two times already. My concern if there is in changes on my order at least they update their customer. I can’t wait for next year  and end up canceling my order.<//text>< Pics>

This was the second time in a couple of weeks that I came to the store. The first time was on a weekend, and it was busy, so I tolerated not being approached for help. Today I was in the store for about 20 minutes,  no other customers ,  and still never
greeted or asked if I needed help. Very disappointed.<//review>

Bought a semiflush lamp online with 4 bulbs.  The lamp arrived in 4 days, but only with 2 bulbs.  When I went to the store in Brea and tried to buy the missing bulbs they told me that they did not have them in the store and that they did not know if they were available online.  They didn't even try to help me get them.  Very bad experience in the store.</review>

The help we received at this store was incredible.  Very Nordstrom like.  All the associates were helpful and made our decisions easy.  I also want to say the installers they use are excellent and extremely professional.  I subtracted one star since we were sold a bulb for another lamp we purchased which already came with one.  Again, no big deal but the bulb did cost us a few extra bucks.</review><Date>1578191757461< /Date><Response>None<//Response>< Gmap_id>

The staff is very helpful. Claudia was very knowledgeable and friendly. The installation crew was timely, efficient and professional. A few days after install a balancing weight came off my fan causing a pretty wild wobble. Scheduling a no charge service was easy and quick. Definitely check them out!< /Review>< pictures>

<Text>Bad experience all together.  We ordered flush mount lights for bedrooms and were told they would be in by one week at the most. After a week and no call we repeatedly called and left messages with the salesperson Claudia.  When we finally got her on the phone she told us that the fixtures that we ordered were on backorder and would take 6 weeks.

I'm guessing that she knew these items were on backorder when she placed the order but told us one week to get the sale. Maybe not so we give the benefit of the doubt.

6 weeks was too long for us to wait as the house was to go for sale within a couple of weeks.

We cancelled the order and were assured that we would receive a refund within 3 business days. After a week and no refund we had to keep calling to ask about the refund and were always told the refund was coming.  This went on for weeks. After a month and a half we had to finally call the bank and dispute the charge.

<text>I am a first time visitor to LPB ( Lamps Plus Brea). Omar Gomez met us at the door with a warm friendly attitude. He asked us what we needed, showed us around but never made us feel rushed or pushed into a purchase. He ended up finding exactly what we needed. Thank you Omar and Robert for your experience and kindness. 5 Stars.< /text>< Gmap_id>

Nice selection of lights and other home furniture. Don't be afraid to haggle on big ticket items. I managed to save a lil bit on an expensive chandelier that was cheaper online since it was tax free. They reduce the price to beat the savings I would have gotten online. That was pretty cool.< /text>

LOVE THIS PLACE!  The staff is informative, but not pushy.  I was helped when I needed to be helped, left alone when I needed to ponder, and left a very happy shopper.

I've already been back!

Their policy of the low price guarantee is a sham ! Found exact same fountain selling for 799.96 at L P for 396. at another online site. Couldn't believe the excuses they gave for not honoring. Why state something you have no intention of honoring</text>

<text>For me, It used to be the Best cuts in the SF valley!!!  UNFORTUNATELY, I will not return to this place, BECAUSE on Easter Sunday Noon I took my 5-year-old son to have his hair cut, but my son fell in front of the shop door and all the barbers began to scream and laugh  of him, I was so disappointed that I thought they were professionals all the time, my son was very sad and he kept crying for a while and he asked me why those bad guys are laughing at him!  very badly done!< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

I've gone to this place alot over the past years, all I can say is to stay clear if you aren't trying to have a military cut or soccer douche cut. They don't listen too what you ask for and tend to just do what they want, while taking forever with every cut.

The only decent barbers in there are Edgar or Chuckie (the owner), but they always have a long line of people waiting for them. Edgar is good, but his haircutting skills depend on wether or not he has a hangover or is high at the time (bad). Although he's good, he won't listen most of the time, an example is that he went up too high on my fade and ruined 8 months of hair growth even though I told him he did last time I visited.<//Text>

<Text>I did not know I was going to get a haircut from a butcher. My fade was uneven and he gave me a Frankenstein/Dracula  line up. Now I have to wear a hat and wait for my hair to grow back in 3 weeks.

<Review>I brought my van here as some lug nuts had broken off and was given a quote that included 3 hours of labor which seemed high since I have replaced them before. It was less than 2 hours between when I dropped off car and got the call it was done but they still charged me for the full 3 hours of labor, plus they still left one of the bad lug nuts on both the front and back tire when they should have just replaced them all while they had the wheel taken apart. Be wary of being overcharged here. The only good thing about the experience is they got my car in fast.< /Review>< Pictures>

<Review>I use them for managing my wheel alignments.
We buy their 3 or 5 years of alignments for our cars.
Each time the alignments are off we make an appointment and they fix it in 30 mins.
Best alignment deal ever.
Thanks for the prompt service each time.

Be aware that while all Big O tire locations will correct alignments when you show them your receipt, not all Big O tires sell this package.
So visit this location and take advantage of this when in the area.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

Very poor customer service. Spoke with Chris who said he is the manager. Not very customer focused. Actually very rude way he communicated. Unfortunately this store is right around the corner from me.  I will be looking for a different location. Big O, you should look for a customer service focused manager.</Text>

I called in to get a quote and sat on hold for at least 10 min.  At the very least let me know you’re busy and to call back.  The person that answered the phone seemed lost and unprofessional.  I’ve been bringing all 5 of my cars there for service, not anymore!</Text>

I previously had my tire service done with a competitor who could not care if I was there or not. Your manager greeted me with a smile and a can do attitude. Additionally your price was 10% below the other store. Price is always important but the customer service given by your staff closed the deal.
Thank you

I had a fast leaking tire one late afternoon.  I had an evening appointment and also needed to drive to the airport early the next day, so no time to waste.  I called Big O Tires near my house and they were able to accommodate me with short notice.  Luckily there weren't that many people waiting for their car at the time.  They patched my tire within an hour and I was on my way.  Service was excellent and the cost wasn't that much.<//Text>

The check in manager was exceptional, my issue is when they finished putting on 4 new tires my rims were extremely filthy.  Grease completely all over them. I would expected them to at mimimun attempt to wipe them clean, I had to ask for rags and do it myself in front of the gents who replaced my tires.  This was awkward
Again the manager who checked me in was exceptional, he just needs to make sure the help takes the time to finish correctly.<//Text>

<review>It was extremely overpriced. It was 240$ for 2 front tires (I asked for the cheapest ones). And when I got my car back he tells me "you know your battery is completely dead right?" And tells me they "had to jump it just to get it out of the shop". He then tells me they usually have batteries in stock but don't today. We I got in my car my radio no longer worked due to the supposed problem with my battery. However what I think really happened was they took my battery out of my car and we're going to put a bad one in in hopes to sell me a new battery but realized they had none in stock and put my battery back in my car. The reason I think this was as soon as I left I checked the volts going from my battery to my alternator using my multimeter I have in my tool bag in the back of my car, and everything was fine, I even turned off and turned my car on multiple times that same day. I've been driving with the same battery for about 2 weeks and no issues. I really feel like I've been ripped off. The date if my service was 12/6/18< /review><Rating>1<//Rating>< Gmap_id>

<review>Horrible service took the truck in for an alignment and had to take it back to get it done again shims came out according to the manager.  after the second time the shims came out again I call the manager once again to explain the situation and his answer was that they never touch that part after they put shims in the same part that they claim they never touch the first time  and the manager was super rude and what surprises me the most that his quick answer after the second time I called them  was we can refund the money so you can take it somewhere else hopefully this will reach the owner and he can fix my truck that his so call mechanics screwed up the first time< /review>< Pics>

<review>These guys are the best!!!

Had a problem with two stripped lug nuts, corners were rounded, no way to remove.  Took my car in on a Sunday at 9:15 am, these guys were slammed with real tire buying customers, but said they'd try to help me.  Brought some work and figured I'd be there a few hours and not sure if they could fix it.  Another shop told me they might have to drill out the wheel stud!

Within an hour Steve, one of the techs. came and told me he got them both done!  He broke one of his tools to get the lug nut offr but he didn't want anything from me!!

Thank you guys so much!  Anytime I've been there everyone has been so nice and helpful.  I would have paid $100 bucks, and they didn't want anything.  Great people!!  Mike from Dana Point.< /review>< pictures>

<text>The one dude is so dry and rude. The first time I stopped by because I saw the now hiring sign and he was really not nice at all.  Didnt seem to want to even give me an application to fill out. Gave him the benefit of doubt and just let it go.  A few weeks later I went in with a flat that needed to be plugged.  Asked him about the promotion on their window and he acted as if I just didnt qualify. I asked him about pricing for just getting 2 new tires he seemed to just not want to help at all.
I left and went across the street to another place and the 2 gentlemen were really nice.  Just like the rest of San Clemente. I love this town because the people here are really nice. But that dude really doesn't know what good customer service is.< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>{'time': 1553034472205, 'text': "Hi, Justin, thank you for bringing this matter to our attention.

The service was excellent but they were not up front with me with the pricing of my services so I felt I was way overcharged without a legitimate explanation up front.</Review>

What happened to...
Good customer service!!!
It went from 5 to 0
I thought service should get better and not worst
So I came in with a flat tire
(* Keep it local they said)
They were too busy, and asked me to come back the next day
I arrived at 7:30 and he found an other excuse to not fix it
Maybe my business was not much he even said that it will be a liability for such a big company to fix my flat tire, he recommend an small mom and pop shop
I guess I will take my business somewhere else
Will not come back again or recommend to anybody< /text>

<Text>Went in for a simple rotation three employees were standing doing nothing. Only one car in bay.  I asked how long it would take he said I would have to leave the car for a few hours? Because he had appointments? It's a 20 min job? After purchasing at least 27 tires from big o and at least 6 from this location, its time to find a better local tire shop that provides better service. I won't go there or buy my tires from big o again.</Text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>{'time': 1527060959661, 'text': "Hi Ramzi, we appreciate you taking the time to write a review.

The representative indicated that I needed my alignment done, but when I checked the numbers he provided to me afterwards, all initial readings were in the appropriate range. It was inappropriate to charge me for this service when my car did not need it.< /review>

<review>One of my trailer tires developed a bad stem. I first went to Costco because it was close. They won't service any tires unless they sold them. I won't be going back there except for groceries. I made another call to an independent tire store near Dana Point at 5:00PM. They said they were too busy and would not be able to get to it that day even though there was an hour left before closing. I called Big O in San Clemente. They were pleasant and enthusiastic on the phone and told me for as long as I got there before closing time, they would fix me up. I realize this is more of a pain in the rump and isn't a money maker but I was set on going fishing the next morning. Not only did Big O fix me up quickly, but insisted on not charging me. My Rav4 needs new tires and I know where I will be buying them. I don't feel any need to shop around and I won't. I have to thank the other 2 businesses for not helping me out as it enabled me to find a real tire store. Thanks again Big O!<//review>< pics>

Went in for an alignment , rotation, balance and had some front stuts installed. I was told the rotation was free because I had work done to me suspension. Still got charged. That's not the bad part. They never rotated the tires! Came back and they told me it was due to the tires being in such bad condition... Well that would of been nice to know before I left in the first place... I then asked for the $20 refund on the rotation and they told me they couldn't because the manager was not available to approve it. I would have to come back next week. Not only did they lie about the rotation service never even given they told me they filled the tire pressure and to my surprise it was 8 lbs below the tire recommended pressure. They told me then after complaining that I needed to purchase tires asap and that my vehicle was a safety hazard. Went to Costco and they said I was good for another 3000 miles. Horrible service.</Text>

I've been coming here for years and have watched at least three or four different managers come and go over the course of 15 years. It doesn't seem to matter who is in charge, these guys always take great care of my vehicles and give me a fair and honest price.< /review>

<Text>**************  DO NO GO HERE!!!!!! if you value your hard-earned money and your LIFE (out of vehicle safety) DO NO GO HERE!!!!!! *******

Worse service i have even seen in almost 30 years.
THE MANAGER LOOKED ME IN THE EYE AND LIED TO ME.
said that they did work they did not do.
said my vehicle would require additional billing of well over $200 because, get this, "it requires shims".... 4WD IFS trucks no not require shims.... when confronted they still refused to do the work.

It will be interesting to see what the C.A. Bureau of Automotive Repair (BAR ) finds here in their investigation.
I will also be notifying BIG-O corporate to examine this location as well.

I have lived in san Clemente over 20 years. this shop was terrible 10 years ago, and it is still terrible today.

Do NOT buy a Groupon for this place.  I went there to use it and since I wanted synthetic oil for my Honda they said there would be an additional cost.  Fine that is what I expected from the fine print.  What I didn't expect is that it would be $65 MORE.  What a rip off.</Review>

<review>I needed some gear before going out on an extended 3/4 day boat. Of course I forgot a rig at home, so I couldn't ask for fresh line on it and I didn't feel comfortable with joining the braided to fluorocarbon line. Well Steve taught me how he does it and I am grateful for the lesson. I caught a nice Yellowtail and my line stood strong.
It's a blessing to have a place like Taka's that care of their customers and having fresh fish for the family.
Thank you so much for your dedication.</review><rating>5<//rating><Gmap_id>0x80dd29710f84eb93:0x19e81fa2072d1511<//Gmap_id><Time>1591795932376</Time>< name>

Taka and Katie deserve more stars. Their customer service is unparalleled. They have made custom rods for me, tracked down reels they didn't have in stock, gave true and honest advice.
I have honestly never seen that level of customer service, even at 5 star resorts.
If I need anything of value, I go there.<//text>

The virtues we are proud of holding, are the virtues we seek out in others. These people are who surround us regardless of weather or not we recognize it.
The current owner and operator, Steve who currently runs his fathers old shop, Taka, has done nothing less than an outstanding job thus far. That I believe is because of his virtues, personal morals, and business ethics. He has a meticulous attention to detail, cares more about honesty above all else, and carries himself with the knowledgeable and humble demeanor you expect from a wise old fisherman.. I will be a loyal customer for as long as I am able to fish, and probably long after that.<//text>

Taka's is THE PLACE to go to if you're looking for an honest opinion & recommendation for all things fishing! Taka, Steve & Katy are always super friendly & helpful. Taka & Steve are both knowledgeable & experienced fishermen, evident from all the pics of all the BIG catches throughout the years. Taka even does custom wrap rods. I just picked up my custom wrap rod & it's so perfect for me! You can tell Taka took his time with it because of the attention to details & the quality of craftsmanship with my finished rod. He even gave me demonstrations & pointers on what to do & what not to do when I'm out there fishing. His mild manner demeanor makes me very receptive to it all. Thank you for your genuine enthusiasm in helping me be a better fisher. Come on by, say hi, tell 'em Kim sent you . You won't be disappointed!< /Text>

First time here, my son Mark have known Taka and his Family for a very long since he was little and they're still friends until this day. My son wanted me to meet Taka and his Family. I met the most Wonderful and Nice Family, they were Sweet, they hugged me and told me my Son was raised right by me and his dad. I enjoyed visiting Taka's Bait & Tackle, I will visit again. Thank you Taka and Family 😊<//Text>

Taka has a precise skill of getting new line put on your reels tight with no underwraps like some places. You need a rod re-wrapped, Taka's your man. If you need a reel serviced and repaired, Steve will take good care of you as if it were his own.  Stop by and meet this friendly family. You'll be happy you did.<//review>< Pics>

I've been going there for over 6 years and I've never had a problem. I've learned so much from these guys and their knowledge has made me a better fisherman. If they say something is bad/wrong/won't work, they're probably right. There's no way you can step in there and not immediately see they have experience. On top of that, the prices are good! They do rod/reel repair and service, sell bait, and you feel the family vibe there. My only stop for gear!< /text>

Steve is absolutely amazing I flew in from KY was not able to bring my own tackle. For far less than I expected to pay I was setup with everything I needed to catch fish the same day. I visited the tackle shop everyday for friendly conversation and tips. The tips were always on point the prices were always the best I could ask for. Without Steve's advice there is a good chance I would not have caught the nearly 100 fish that I did in the 5 days of fishing in California. This is the best tackle shop in SoCal period no questions asked if you are a local or a traveler this is the best place to be. My home tackle shop away from home!</Text>

Taka has years of fishing experience to share. He took the time to demonstrate to my wife how even small person can fight and land a big fish. Now she feels comfortable to go out when the big bonita and yellowtail are biting. Really invaluable help! Ask for expert advice on rods, reels, line and nice rod wrapping too.<//Review>

<rating>5<//rating><review>Had couple of my rods serviced here a year or two ago and was total satisfied, today brought my Saltiga in for  new braid line, got the reel spooled up and drag setup by Mr. Taka in less than 10 minutes!  top notch customer service, the entire staff was extremely friendly and help full.  Easily my most favorite tackle shop and will come again when in need for fishing stuff.  I highly recommend everyone to give Taka tackle a visit to see what I mean.</review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

I am blessed to have grown up within minutes of Taka's. I have fished for most of my life and Taka's is the place I go to when ever I need good advice. Wal-mart has better prices but I dont care one bit. Taka, his wife and his staff are always helpful in any way they can be. Love this place< /review>

<Review>There is not a single tackle shop in Orange County that can top Taka's Tackle in terms of expertise, quality service and friendliness.  I've been coming here for years and unlike other OC tackle/outfitter shops, they have never given me reason to go elsewhere.  They are honest, outgoing and genuinely care about their customers.  Today, Taka vetoed my request for a certain service because he knew I didn't need it (even though he could have made extra money off it).  This family run operation is the epitome of HONEST WORK and they will have my loyalty forever!  PS - the guy who wanted to take a Penn Senator to the lake...that's a trolling reel for tuna, buddy.  Taka was right.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None<//resp>< GmapID>

🤩 super impressed! Front staff professional. Back office attentive,polite - but efficient! My appoint was on time. No gimmicks or up-sale on any product or service. Trustworthy dentist that chose conservative treatment (really impressed)! Preserve rather than drill - not many dentists are trustworthy like this. Well done! 10 out 10 experience. Superb!<//text>

<Review>The staff at Khorsand Dental Group are professional and courteous. Personally, I can’t recommend them because I am not happy with the dental work they have done on me since I started going there around 3 years ago. Today was my last visit and I will not be going back. I imagine if you don’t have too many dental issues this is a good place but every time I went in it felt like I was losing another tooth or having to get the previous procedure fixed. All I have to show from my time getting dental work done at Khorsand Dental Group is 1 less molar and a broken crown that they did and today wanted to remove and replace with an implant. Extremely disappointed with my experience there and I can’t recommend their services.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics><time>1629438635272<//time><GmapID>0x80d7673021bd7a29:0x776046a0c9e91ff7<//GmapID>< UserId.>

<review>On 06-16-21 we had to make an emergency after hours appointment to get my old man's tooth pulled that was in what seemed to him like it was in the early stages of abscessing. It was quick and easy and Dr. Ray was amazing, she got the tooth out in one go and the old man was very pleased and even said he would be willing to go back despite us living in Nebraska. All in all 10/10 would return.< /review>< gmapID>

These reviews are no exaggeration. Dr. Khorsand is great at what he does and has a fun personality that puts you at ease, which is perfect if you get nervous at the dentist. Highly recommend.< /text>

<rating>5< /rating><text>I had such a great experience. I went in for a root canal on one of my bridged molars and we so worried that I would have to pay our of pocket for a whole new bridge plus the root canal. The doctor was extra careful and very patient and was able to save the bridge. I highly recommend having all your dental care done here. It's by far the best place in the Imperial Valley.<//text>< Pictures>

Very pleasant experience especially since I was roughly 5 years old when I went to the dentist for my first time and never went to a dentist since due to a bad experience. Over here was my first time since and it was very nice with very kind staff. Thanks for a great experience.< /Text>

I never give a full 5 stars because there is always areas that can be improved. With that being said, the Khorsand Dental Group is a top notch facility with equipment that no other dentists in the area have. Friendly staff and they stay on schedule better than most. I highly recommend them.</Review>

<text>I recently had a wonderful visit to Dr. K's office. I had a teeth cleaning, then Dr. Nguyen worked on replacing a crown, and then I had a full set of x-rays done, all in the same day. Dr. N. has also done a previous root canal for me. Every experience in this dentist's office has been positive, for me the only negative is my own fear. I highly recommend this practice, they are great!< /text><gmap_id>0x80d7673021bd7a29:0x776046a0c9e91ff7</gmap_id><time>1609912937665< /time>< Rating>

I’m a previous patient at this place, I called because I had an emergency. Abscess or wisdom tooth coming out on the back of my gum that has had me in severe pain throughout my whole jaw for two days! As a pregnant woman who hasn’t been able to eat because I can’t close my mouth fully, it’s really upsetting that they claim they have emergency appointments but couldn’t get me in for the next 2-3 weeks?? How is that an emergency appointment. Wont be coming here again and taking my family elsewhere. Somewhere that they care about our teeth enough to make time for us during emergencies.

UPDATE: They called back hours later because there was a cancellation and got me in. I appreciate the amazing customer service and the call back, It really showed me that they do care about my pain.< /review>

I have been coming to Dr. Khorsan’s for quite some time .  I met Dr. Khorsan and his staff back in 2013.  He took me in as if I was part of of his own  family. I have not seen or worked with a better dentist than him. Over the years, I have brought over the rest of my family; my parents; my siblings, my children, nieces and nephews, etc. Besides having the best dental work in the valley; his prices are very competitive. We are very happy with Dr. Khorsan and his staff. I strongly recommend everyone to go visit him and his practice.  You will not regret it.</review>

Unfortunately I never got the names of the Dental Assistant and Dentist who both did a great job working with my six year old who has Autism Spectrum Disorder. They were able to successfully perforn X-ray, cleaning, and a sealant on one of my child's permanent teeth which is amazing that they got so far. My hubby and I appreciate the care of the Dentist, and the extra effort of the Dental Assistant who added a pop up note in my child's file because she was thoughtful to consider the possibility that if she were off the next time we visit that the next person would be aware of my child's special needs. I was so impressed with the care my child received that I scheduled an appointment myself. I can recommend, but it's up to you to try them for yourself.<//review>

Yikes, what a terrible experience. Had my wisdom teeth extraction today. Apparently Dr. Khorsand removed 3 of my teeth but then left without saying a word? Sat with gauze and another plastic thing that kept my mouth open and with literally no one coming to check up for 30+ minutes. Obviously I was super confused and about to flag someone down until thank god Dr. Wray came and took out my last tooth for me. Apparently, the last one was curved and needed more time for numbing which I would have been completely fine with had someone let me know.< /review>

I can recommend, but it's up to you to try them for yourself.< /review><pics>None</pics><resp>None</resp>< gmapID>

For being my first time with this dentist I was very impressed on how good the dentist is and the important thing for me was that I didn’t feel no pain while getting a root canal done!!!!   Wow!!!

I have been coming to Dr. Khorsan’s for quite some time .  I met Dr. Khorsan and his staff back in 2013.  He took me in as if I was part of of his own  family. I have not seen or worked with a better dentist than him. Over the years, I have brought over the rest of my family; my parents; my siblings, my children, nieces and nephews, etc. Besides having the best dental work in the valley; his prices are very competitive. We are very happy with Dr. Khorsan and his staff. I strongly recommend everyone to go visit him and his practice.  You will not regret it.<//text>

If I could give this office 10 stars I would! I had a crown fall out at lunch time on a Friday, went in because my dentist was closed for the weekend , and they put me on the schedule not even being a current patient. The experience was quick and professional and although I had already heard good things about Dr. Khorsand I experienced it for myself. So grateful thanks! Highly recommend!!</review>

My daughter was taken care of and we didn’t wait long at all. We scheduled an appointment, everything went smooth. Staff was professional as well.

It could be a nightmare for a kid to go to the dentist but the staff knows how to manage the anxiety and all worked out well.

We’ll be taking my daughter here going forward.

There’s not many choices in the Valley. I’m glad I took her to this establishment</Review>

Had molar surgery. The surgery was fast felt less than 15-20min, but even thought I had an appointment (11 am)I had to wait for a long time. Almost an hour in the waiting area and another hour on the surgery chair. I was there from 11 am to 1:30 pm.</review>

<text>Where do I begin! I had a mouth full of issues and such a fear of dentists due to a couple of really bad past experiances. I came to Dr Khorsand by way of referral and he and the staff are to be recognized for the care and compassion they show thier patients. I had a root canal recently and on my way home from the procedure(I live 45 miles away) the anesthetic wore off and the pain hit. It was so bad I was contiplating going to the emergency room(pain always hits after hours). I checked Dr. Khorsands website and there was an emergency contact listing so I called. I actually spoke to Dr. K directly and he was genuinely concerned, gave me instructions to visit the urgent care next to his office and asked me to call me him back with updates. Point to my story is at that point in time I was made to feel like I was his only patient and he was genuinely concerned for the pain I was in. This kind of care is almost non-existing in this day and age. This Dr and his staff have a huge patient load yet they still go the extra mile. I could not be any more satisfied with the care I have gotten through Dr. K and his staff. Blessings to all and THANK YOU!< /text><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

This dental office is the shizz! The staff is not only friendly, but very beautiful as well! Dr. Khorsand is the highlight of my day! I wish I could go to the dentist EVERY DAY! I can't wait to get another cavity or root canal!

I am extremely pleased with the outcome of my teeth after they took my braces off. I finally have a sexy mouth. :D

In all seriousness, great dental office!< /Text>

Worst experience with a Dentist in my life! And check the records I was a patient for over ten years. It all began with a permanent tooth being pulled out when I was 17 causing my jaw to sway on one side.His opinion was asked before the extraction and he did not stop it. I don't remember which dentist did the extraction otherwise I would have sued them. Every certified Dentist should know what a permanent teeth looks like! Anyways fast-forward 8 years later after trying to fix the problem with another dentist who did nothing and after asking for Khorsand's idiotic opinion during the 8 years I had braces he responds, "well if you feel they are not helping you then tell them." Then I went to another Dentist to have my jaw aligned this time by doing it correctly with braces and tooth extractions. Now needing to remove 3 more teeth. He says I need a root canal immediately and tells me to take out the braces otherwise I will get a mouth full of cavities. I never had my jaw aligned but I did stop going to that Dentist who seems to only care about the money and not his patients. It turns out I did not need a root canal and it was just cavities that needed filling. This has been a long time coming and I just felt I needed to get this information out because I would hate for someone else to have the same experience I did. Doctor's should do their best to make sure a patient does not have to go through  horrendous experiences . I assure you there are better doctors in the valley to go to.</Text>

<Review>Dr. Khorsand is an exceptional dentist! The best that I have ever been to! My husband, children and I have been patients of his for 7 years and have loved him since day one. I had a horrible experience when I was a child that caused me to be petrified of the dentist. Dr. Khorsand knows how to handle me when I start to freak and can calm me down immediately! He is also amazing with my three little ones. They actually get excited when they have an appointment. The level of care you receive not only from the dentist, but his staff is phenomenal. I highly recommend him to absolutely everyone. If you need a dentist that will treat you with the utmost care and go above and beyond, you have found your guy. Can't say enough good things about him.<//Review><username>Danielle Lemay<//username><time>1461958777801</time></record></dataset><record>

Just had my fast braces removed and I'd like to say that my experience was awesome. The ENTIRE office is extremely courteous and professional, the front desk, ortho department, billing, the hygienist and both doctors, everything was top notch. I'm actually kind of sad that the braces are done.... not! Thank you all it was fun.</text>

This is the best dentist office in the entire area.  The staff was extremely kind and courteous.  Dr. Khorsand is not only brilliant in his dental work but he is also the least expensive.  I now receive more compliments on my teeth than ever before.</text>

This is an excellent dentist.  I moved here three years ago and had been using another dentist but wasn't happy.  Then I found Dr. Khorsand and he has been a blessing to my family.  My teeth look the best that they have ever looked in my entire life.  I would recommend this dentist to anyone.<//review>

<Review>Really enjoyed going. You don’t hear that when it comes to the dentist, but they were very friendly. Not only that the doctor was very warm and open. When I had questions she explained where I understood. The staff was very friendly and the office VERY clean. The office staff was more then willing to work with me and my billing and explained how things were going to happen.</Review><UserId.>111884410591108106892<//UserId.><Time>1525895068391< /Time><Response>None</Response>< Pictures>

I have been going to this dentist for several years and this is the best dental office in the area.  The entire staff is very professional and sincere.  I have had more people ask me who my dentist is because my teeth look amazing.  I highly recommend Dr. Khorsand to anyone that is looking for a great dental office.<//text>

<username>Jonathan Cooper</username><Time>1577779997473< /Time><Rating>5< /Rating><text>I am in the process of getting pre-existing work done from teeth grinding and many years without going to the dentist.  Unfortunately, i cant afford to get all my work done here cause i have different insurance.  However, i was referred here for an extraction.  I had a problematic molar with a large filling that cracked taken care of.  They did one xray and gave me a pricing disclosure and recommendation to do a bone graft. It is a great idea to alleviate bone loss.  The level of confidence from the doctor and assistant that it was going to be an easy procedure made me feel at ease.  The numbing was strong and allowed them to start quickly.  I did not experience any discomfort at all. It has been 4 days and i have only experienced a little bit of soreness and havnt needed painkillers. Next year or when possible i wouldnt hesitate to come back to get an implant.</text>< Pictures>

I've been going to the same dentist for over 12 years, it's a bummer that he doesnt do surgery, which is why I moved to Khorsand. Excellent customer service. my swollen gum didnt hurt while doing x-rays like it usually does at my old dentist. So happy I was told about this place instead of going out of the valley. A relief.</text>

<Rate>1</Rate><text>Worst experience with a Dentist in my life! And check the records I was a patient for over ten years. It all began with a permanent tooth being pulled out when I was 17 causing my jaw to sway on one side.His opinion was asked before the extraction and he did not stop it. I don't remember which dentist did the extraction otherwise I would have sued them. Every certified Dentist should know what a permanent teeth looks like! Anyways fast-forward 8 years later after trying to fix the problem with another dentist who did nothing and after asking for Khorsand's idiotic opinion during the 8 years I had braces he responds, "well if you feel they are not helping you then tell them." Then I went to another Dentist to have my jaw aligned this time by doing it correctly with braces and tooth extractions. Now needing to remove 3 more teeth. He says I need a root canal immediately and tells me to take out the braces otherwise I will get a mouth full of cavities. I never had my jaw aligned but I did stop going to that Dentist who seems to only care about the money and not his patients. It turns out I did not need a root canal and it was just cavities that needed filling. This has been a long time coming and I just felt I needed to get this information out because I would hate for someone else to have the same experience I did. Doctor's should do their best to make sure a patient does not have to go through  horrendous experiences . I assure you there are better doctors in the valley to go to.< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures><time>1510795834876</time></record></dataset><record>

The only thing I did not like was the wait period.  My appointment was at 4pm and I was out of the office at 6pm.
I do like they way I was treated by the personel, specially the lady that clean my teeth, I think her name is Susan.  If that is not her name sorys, I am terrible remembering names.</Text>

<name>Tina Shafer</name><review>Where do I begin! I had a mouth full of issues and such a fear of dentists due to a couple of really bad past experiances. I came to Dr Khorsand by way of referral and he and the staff are to be recognized for the care and compassion they show thier patients. I had a root canal recently and on my way home from the procedure(I live 45 miles away) the anesthetic wore off and the pain hit. It was so bad I was contiplating going to the emergency room(pain always hits after hours). I checked Dr. Khorsands website and there was an emergency contact listing so I called. I actually spoke to Dr. K directly and he was genuinely concerned, gave me instructions to visit the urgent care next to his office and asked me to call me him back with updates. Point to my story is at that point in time I was made to feel like I was his only patient and he was genuinely concerned for the pain I was in. This kind of care is almost non-existing in this day and age. This Dr and his staff have a huge patient load yet they still go the extra mile. I could not be any more satisfied with the care I have gotten through Dr. K and his staff. Blessings to all and THANK YOU!< /review><pictures>None< /pictures><Time>1544556312291< /Time></record></dataset><record>

Don't know where some of these reviews are coming from but Dr. Khorsand was anything but "comforting and kind". He was arrogant and rushed. He didn't even want to hear about what was wrong with my tooth... he cut me off and said " I'll be the judge of that". Horrible experience. Never again!!!<//text>

< Review>
Overall it was a good experience, got my wisdom teeth extracted, quick and easy. I was super nervous and the assistant was sweet and caring. The doctor was also very nice. After pulling out my teeth, which literally took 5 second. Doctor let me go right away, and said he was done and i was ready to go. I wasnt given any instructions about aftercare or what I was suspose to do. I had to google what to do. Im still not sure when I am allowed to eat yet, because google always mix stuff up. Wish i couldve recieved instructions or atleast have them tell me there isnt any restriction. Im sure they must of forget, especially if its busy but this is an important part of procedure. A patient needs to know what to do post extraction, and the best way is by hearing from the doctor that did the extraction. Not from google! All in all, people make mistakes, and well im doing pretty good. So i guess im recovering well.</Review>

{'time': 1502570799130, 'text': "Hi Diana, we are glad you are doing well. Every patient that leaves the practice after your type of procedure should receive a detailed post extraction care sheet with extra gauze. The instruction sheet also contains Dr. Khorsand's personal 24hr contact phone number. I can only assume that since your procedure went very fast and very well the staff must have forgotten to give you the sheet. Thank you for your kind review and taking the time to tell us your experience."}<//Resp>

It was one of the best experience I have ever had at the dentist I've gone to other dentist here in valley but dr Korsand is one of the best dentist his office is clean and I use to go to el centro dental right next to the dollar store by 4th street and I've never liked it there disrespectfull and they never put u to sleep well enough how there suppose to but at dr korsand it's totally different he explains everything and if he sees u freaking out like I was he tells u all I'm doing is putting pressure 3 sec later he's like it out and u don't feel anything it's amazing well definitely continue going to his office he took out 4 wisdom teeth today and didn't feel a thing.just as soon as the anesthesia was away I felt a lil pain but nuthing major</text>

Terrible experience for my 4 year old girl and myself seen how much she sufferered in this dental office. The wost feeling when you see your child crying leaving the office of Khorsand with a ballin in her hand and a wounded lip for days after the root canal was made. NEVER will  go back.</text>

< review>
Friendly staff but ask questions!  I.e: I want to know what my insurance will and will not pay for BEFORE they do it so I don’t get any surprises in a bill later.  They will want to do a so called “Deep-cleaning”, that will cost out of pocket upwards of $260 .  I’d rather them do a regular cleaning that my insurance will pay for entirely.  Plus a “Deep cleaning” can be intensive and very uncomfortable… not to mention, in MY mind, ‘Questionable’ for its necessity!<//review>

I don't want to brag, but I have the best dentist in town, since I moved to this town. I got lucky that way. Everything remains impeccable and thorough at his office. At my age, my teeth are in great shape! I credit this to my incredible dentist and his amazing staff. Dentistry is like an art to him!< /Review>

< Review>
I hate to tell you how good this place is, because they're not taking new patients right now.  I've been to several different dentists over the years.  Dr. Dozier is far and above the best dentist I've ever been to. That includes his staff and everyone I've interacted with at his office.  I had no idea that going to the dentist could be such a positive, happy experience until I started going to see him.
If they start taking new patients again and you get the chance to be seen by him, you'll kick yourself for not finding someone this good before.<//Review>

<Review>I have been a patient in this office for about 25 years. Dr. Dozier and staff are the best.  They are always caring and friendly.  I am naturally nervous about going to the dentist but Dr. Dozier always makes me feel calm and cared for.  They have also taken extra steps to keep us safe during Covid19.</Review>< Date>

This entire office staff provides great customer service and care! Any time an urgent care problem occurs, they are quick to get you in! The team always listens to your concerns and asks follow questions to get insight into the problem and provides great solutions! Dr Dozier always goes above and beyond to provide excellent care and gives great advise on preventative care! I highly recommend this Dr for your dental care!</Review>

<Text>One safety standard for you and one for me.

The visit started as the usual 5-star rated one. Dr. Dozier finished a procedure and the hygienist started x-raying my teeth. There was a problem.

The hygienist wanted me to use my hand to hold the tab for my front teeth to be x-rayed.  I refused to do so because my hand would be visible to the x-ray radiation. And I preferred by hand under the lead apron.

The hygienist said that the x-ray gun would miss my hand.

The hygienist said that the x-ray was so small that if would do nothing to my hand.

The hygienist asked me why I was concerned. I responded that most radiologists do not condone unwarranted x-ray exposers.

The hygienist said that she could show me recent data that says there is no lead apron needed.

I refused to hold the tab.

The hygienist said that the open way to get the x-ray was for her to hold the tab. Then she said that her holding the tab would expose her hand to x-ray radiation!!! “I am not doing to do that.” She said.

The hygienist then raved about me not wanting certain data to be obtained.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

By far the best dentist I've ever been to. Takes time to explain everything and gives you options for your treatment. He is excellent with kids too.  My at the time 3 year old son had a blast during his check up. Dr. Dozier knows how to make his little patients comfortable. Everybody at the office is very friendly and they really treat you like a family. If you thinking about changing your dentist or looking for one no need to look further. You found him! Thanks for all your care Dr. Dozier<//Review>

Who loves going to the dentist? My family does!  Dr Dozier and his staff are the best.  My 7 year old grand daughter said " I haven't seen Dr Danny in a long time, I miss him"  No worries honey, you have an appointment next week. Wow!<//text>

Dr. Dozier has been my Dentist since I was a child. I grew up in Stockton, Ca. I went to University of the Pacific for Undergraduate Degree. I graduated from University of the Pacific School of Dentistry in 2009 and Advanced education in General Dentistry Residency in 2010 . My Dental practice, Fort Worth Dental Arts is in Fort Worth, TX which is a little far for friends that I grew up with to travel for treatment! So when my friends who I care about call me to ask who they should go to in Stockton for Dental treatment. I ask Doctor Dozier to take care of them. He is a good man and a very talented Dentist. You will not be disappointed with the quality of his care.

<review>I've been to a lot of dentists, and no one compares to Dr. Dozier. He actually cares about your dental health, not just recommending you expensive surgeries. In fact, he'll do everything he can to help you PREVENT expensive surgery - like teaching you how to brush and floss right, giving great dental advice, etc. He's so good, I hardly ever have to see him because my teeth are in such great shape. He could probably have an enormous clientele, but he keeps it small intentionally so that he can provide personal, quality care. He's also a great, family-oriented guy.<//review>< pictures>

<Review>I had a minor discomfort in a tooth ... I called the office and within days got an appointment. Dr. Dozier saw the problem and shortly thereafter ... I was on my way home with the problem solved (a new filling).  Also, I have always been impressed with his friendly office staff and his dental assistant who was very knowledgable. My family has been going to Dr. Dozier for as long as I can remember. The office is well-located off March Lane and there is plenty of free parking outside.</Review><Name>Don Stadtner< /Name>< gmap_id>

< Review>
I've never done a return. I've honestly never really bought clothes online before but I expected Big Bud Press to have a 30 day return window like most places I've seen online. Unfortunately they only have a 14 day window.

I received my package a bit later than the tracking suggested due to the large amounts of delays with holiday/January shipping in general. So I was at 16 days by tracking but still within 14 days since the package arrived on my doorstep.

However when I looked at their website the company acknowledged shipping delays in January and offered store credit in the case of delayed returns. Nice!

I reached asap on a Saturday (there customer service isn't available on the weekends) and received a prompt "no" from their return department on Monday morning, 9am. I explained how there was a delay different then the suggested tracking (I live in a very small town). They said no and highlighted their return policies. When I went to check the policy I had seen for delayed shipping to be turned into store credit the policy it had been removed from their website.

I've gained a lot of weight during quarantine and I am trying to do my best to find pants in a way that is safe. I've struggled with body issues my whole life and I, like many people, am having a difficult time with their body during quarantine.

The 14 day return window is not enough time to safely shop for pants during this period of quarantine, and it seems that BIG BUD Press's return customer service is very unforgiving in regards to all the above mentioned.

I understand how this is from a company stand point, but from a human one, I am a bit hurt. I'll most likely be looking to shop somewhere else in the future.

Edit: Thank you so much for responding! I suppose with so many locations I didn't think of you guys as a small business. You're very popular! I appreciate you looking into my case.

My hope is that you have plans to extend your return window as your company expands. I'm sure that returns are difficult during these times of covid on the business side of thing. I like your business because it incorporates a lot of plus size clothing but I think, as you must know from experience building a plus sized brand, that the reality trying on clothes vs. what they present online can be an especially difficult and unique challenge for plus sized people.

In my opinion the 14 day return window doesn't do much to elevate this difficulty.

My story: Buying these pants was difficult decision for me, finding a good pair of pants that fit when you've dramatically changed sizes is an emotional ordeal outright, especially when struggling with body issues. I know from many of my friends, family, and coworkers that this issue of body image struggle is not unique but in fact very common in the U.S.

I hope that you will hear this story and know that I'm not trying to hurt you or the brand you worked so hard to create (I know public reviews are stressful) but that I just want to offer my feedback as a customer.

Thank you for your time</Review>

{'time': 1611599136913, 'text': "Hi Milly--\n\nSo sorry to hear you had a negative experience shopping with us. I looked into your order I'm seeing it was delivered on January 7. On our help page and the packing slip you received in your order it states that we go by 14 days from date of delivery as marked by tracking. The notice you are referring to on our help page was our holiday return policy that ended January 4. Most small brands like ours have shorter return windows-- we try to make that clear everywhere we can-- it's listed on all the email correspondences you received from us as well as physically on the packing slip you receive in your order. It's also on our help page prior to purchasing. You would have had to email us on January 21 to be inside your return window but you emailed on January 23. I know this all may seem arbitrary but we have these policies posted in as many places as we possibly can to help keep everyone as informed as possible."}<//response>

The owners/operaters are incredibly kind and helpful as well. I even got pictures taken by them of my visit since I asked! Prices are very reasonable, too. Directly across from the Echoplex, the bright pink and yellow storefront is impossible to miss.

Okay so I haven't been to the actual store but this brand is AMAZING!!! All of the stuff I've gotten from them has fit like a freaking glove and I so badly want to purchase more. The size charts are super helpful and I love how they include what sizes the models are wearing. I also had purchased a jumpsuit that happened to not have belt-loops and they gave me a very generous refund (which I was more than happy to receive, even though it wasn't that big of a deal). Stellar brand, I'd give them a 10 star if possible.</Text>

There was a really good selection of sleeping bags, self inflating pads and with the help of the sales people there, I was able to put together a first time camping trip with nothing forgotten...
I really enjoy this store, although it's a bit pricey, the quality of the products are great and for that reason I have returned.< /review>

Followed their sizing chart to a T and the size I got wouldn’t go even over my hips although they were 70$ apparently that was onsale for them even though I didn’t hit the sale section.
So they won’t even exchange for a different size so I’ll be eating the cost.

Please update your sizing chart if someone’s waist is 26-28 make sure the pants are too that you put as the sizing.

Highly disappointed with the lack of customer service of this company needless to say I won’t be buying from them again when I tried to support a “small business” and I’ll be sure to tell my friends and followers not to buy from them either.</Review>

I first found out about them on Instagram, before they had opened up shop in Echo Park. When I got to go to their Echo Park location, I was in awe. Every piece of clothing is popping with colors and you could tell how hard their crew works on each piece of clothing. The quality of the shirts I bought is amazing; there’s been no fading in the colors/prints and I’ve had them since December of last year. That’s where I met Sara, one of the photographers and models! She was very kind and helped me out a lot with choosing what size to get! Time to talk about sizes: I LOVE how each shirt is unisex. It makes me feel comfy gender-wise and appearance-wise :) I was there for the opening of the new Highland Park store and waited in line because this brand and the people are SO worth it!! I was excited when I finally got into the store and bought new items + got cute earrings and a pin! Lacey, Philip, and many others were there to direct and help their customers! And I’ll never get over how kind Philip was at the register! He complimented my hair and called it cute :’) Thank you Big Bud Press crew for being amazing. Never stop ♡<//Text>< Rating>

I'm not a fan of buying anything brand new, and do it VERY rarely and skeptically. I use a backpack every day for everything. Work and not work. Wandering. Road trips. Dog park. My backpack is my only bag. A buddy of mine told me about Big Bud, and I decided to check it out. I instantly fell in love with the Big Flap backpack. Big, smushy, slouchy, POCKETS. WINNER! My favorite backpack of all time, and worth every penny. Worth MORE pennies, honestly. I am a true lover of 70's vintage and bright, bold colors. This amazing, ethical company is my new favorite (along with my forest green big flap pack), and I hope they grow and carry on for many, many years to come.< /review>< Pics>

I ordered a pair of trousers online and unfortunately they were too big for me. For those wondering about exchanges/returns I was able to exchange mine very easily! I emailed the owners and sent back the pair and within a week I had my new pair of trousers that fit PERFECTLY. Since it’s unisex sizing I wasn’t 100% sure about where I was but I definitely recommend sizing up in the pants and then exchanging them for a size smaller if they don’t work. Be wary that your exchanged pair is FINAL SALE but I was very happy with the outcome. Although I shopped online I could tell in the emails that they care a lot and give you plenty of info about what to do! Definitely ordering more from this lovely company in the future!</Review>

This little gem is definitely a unique find! I don’t know what’s better, the fact that their clothes is all made in beautiful Los Angeles, no sweatshops, unisex options, or the originality of both Lacey and Phillip. I’m not kidding when I say I feel so lucky having the opportunity of being able to visit this shop in person. I’ve purchased a burnt orange jumpsuit, their pink poppy seed t-shirt, and their lime colored round backpack (WHICH I CARRY EVERYWHERE). If you’re ever in LA, I truly suggest visiting either their Highland Park or Echo Park locations, both are adorable and you’ll definitely want to capture a picture inside, SO PRECIOUS! I can’t wait to see what other surprises they’ll have in stock come 2019! Thank you guys so living up your dream and sharing it with the world, you’ve definitely colored mine!❤️💛💜💚🧡💙< /review>

Big Bud Press isn’t only a brand that makes vibrant, fun and unique clothing, it’s a small business that supports other small, local businesses, often supporting women of color. The shirts, pins and bags that I own from Big Bud Press are great quality, have held up well and get lots of compliments. Given that it’s such a small company, it’s amazing everything they manage to do — and do it with care and love. They’ve also held their own while big companies rip off their ideas and deal with trolls, and damn, they’ve handled that better than I would. One criticism I have is during flash sales, when shopping for a specific shirt / size, and things immediately sell out. I’ve tried several times to shop during these flash sales and it’s impossible to get what I want. But....that goes to show how in demand their products are. I’ll support them regardless. Hope to see them flourish. Xoxo, supporter in New York City!<//Review>

My sister ordered me an avocado T-shirt for my birthday and it was the best surprise! The quality is beautiful and I’ve never had a shirt so soft. The colors are vibrant and I love that I can see the process of them screen printing the shirts on their Instagram. I can’t wait to order more shirts in the future.<//Text>

Love love LOVE Big Bud Press and those behind it! Although I haven’t had the chance to visit their brick and mortar locations, I have purchased from BBP online — and have zero complaints. Everything has been so well-made, with so much thought behind the creation of each product they carry. Big Bud Press is one of those brands that you know you can buy from with confidence, by supporting locally, ethically made items, and the small business behind it! Absolutely recommend!!</Review>

I love love love this company. I love everything they stand for. Every single item I’ve ever ordered from them has been beautiful and perfect. The one time we were able to go to their store we could not stop talking about our experience afterwards. The person working was so kind. We could have stayed there all day chatting all things Tokyo Disney. In short... BIG BUD FOREVER!</Text>

This company is my absolute favorite! I would spend all my money hear if I could afford to haha
They make the best clothing in the brightest and cutest way possible. I've never worn shirts and dresses that made me feel more like myself and comfortable at the same time. My stupid skin is so sensitive, but it doesn't matter when I wear their clothing, it's so soft and no itchy tags! I have so many shirts, dresses, hats, and pins and I can't wait to get more. 🥰 I love you Big Bud Press!< /Text>

HORRIBLE!! You only get 14 days to return your item from the day of purchase, so if it was shipped you can forget it. The quality of the clothing is horrible as well. They feel like cheap clothes from China.< /review>

I looked into this and the order you placed was weeks outside of our return window when you tried to return your online order. Unfortunately we just can't and don't accept returns outside of window. We try to post return  information in as many places as possible so when you order online-- you receive it on ALL email correspondences (confirmation, shipping, shipping update, and delivery), on your packing slip you receive in your order, on an additional postcard in your order, as well as posted on our website for viewing prior to ordering. I'm also sorry to hear you're also unhappy with the quality. We work with extremely high quality fabrics and sewing shops right here in Los Angeles-- you'd be hard pressed to find higher quality garment made that's made ethically for the price we sell it for. We hope sometime in the future you'll give us another chance to make you happy."}</response><username>Ashley Beeler<//username>< gmapID>

< Review>
The location is super cute, the woman working was sooo friendly and sweet. I got a fanny pack that was $50 (which I understand the price bc everything is handmade) But the fanny pack strap was too long, even when I adjusted it to the shortest it could be it wasn’t tight enough to stay on my waist. No biggie- I sewed it to make it fit. But the zipper on the pack is really thick and toothy and cuts my hand every few days. Also the opening for the fanny pack is weirdly placed, most fanny packs have the opening adjusted so it’s not right up against your stomach. The pack is cute but is pretty annoying to wear for $50 :/</Review>

Wonderful quality of clothing. Received an item as a gift and I was very surprised by the high quality fabric. I would suggest following the company on social media, you can see behind the scenes into what it takes to keep their small business growing and get to know the owners better!

My friend got me a dress as a gift even though I didn’t have any items yet, but solely because we both followed their Instagram and knew they paid their workers fairly and used high quality materials made in the USA. We have both tried to be more sustainable while supporting small businesses and it’s very cool to stumble upon a company and be impressed by them because of their honesty with their customers and impressive work ethic (from color range, to variety of items to a huge variety of sizes for all body types and genders!)

Big Bud is the first company I grew to love before ever owning any of their products which is a bit unconventional, but makes me value my dress even more now because I feel like my hardworking friends made it for me. I would be quite giddy to get to go to one of their stores one day!

I’m well past the fast fashion of mainstream retail that often rips off small business designs, pays their workers poorly and does not cater to a variety of body types. Thanks Big Bud for being so unique and keep at it!< /review>

I’ve been following BBP since they were just selling pins and patches and I am so proud to see how big they’ve grown as a brand. Lacey is a hilarious and brilliant gal that offers transparency in how running a business works. It’s awesome to see this as a business owner myself. She’s inspiring and the whole crew of BBP deserves the best!<//Review>

Been a follower of this small business from early on, and supported them during their kickstarter and I’m so glad I did! They were really great about updating with progress or setbacks during the process. Got a shirt (that I LOVE) from them, plus a pin! Both of which have maintained great quality for the time I’ve owned them and I always get compliments on. The sizing can be a little nerve-racking but they offer such a cohesive sizing guide (including examples with measurements and sizes worn of their size-diverse models!) that I was pretty confident in my choice and really happy with the fit once I received my shirt. They’re also so transparent and communicative with their customers, which I really appreciate. Thanks for being such a rad company BBP!<//Text>

My girlfriend tasked me to buy her a gift at Big Bud Press. Thankfully the girl working in the shop was incredibly helpful and helped me pick out a size that worked for her! I went two weeks ago and have been recommending it ever since. They make everything in LA too so that's a plus<//Text>

Visited the Echo Park store after drooling over their collections online and was stoked on the fit and feel of all of their clothes. The woman behind the counter was so helpful, welcoming and friendly, I wish I could visit more often!!</text>

Ordered 2 limited edition snot girl tees for myself for xmas. The quality is amazing and the shipping was quick! I love this small business and appreciate their size inclusiveness, being a cute, fluffy marshmellow lady myself. I Can't wait to order more from this company! Thanks BBP!!!</Text>

<Review>Return policies are terrible and I found them to be rude when asking politely if I could instead get store credit. You know since they have my money and all. They are a small business that blew up too fast. If I could rate 0 stars believe me I would.</Review>< Name>

<Review>I live in Arkansas and visited the store while visiting LA this summer. A great experience. I’ve since ordered more shirts and was recently gifted a hat! 😍😍. The quality is great, the designs are dreamy, and it’s overall just one of my favorite companies. They give thorough explaination of sizing and be sure to look. I typically am NOT an XXS small but with them I am. Big bud describing the model’s body size and the clothing size they are wearing is extremely helpful and I wish all stores did that. I’ll be back for more, as always. Xoxo</Review><user_name>Jenny Tuz<//user_name></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
Ordered twice now from Big Bud, once from their Kickstarter and once from their sample sale! Although I live in Canada and conversion/shipping can be pricey, I really appreciate all they do at this Lil shop to try to accommodate as many people as they possibly can! As many roadblocks as they had during their Kickstarter they always made sure to be as transparent and informative as possible and although I was eager to get my clothing, I understood and appreciated their updates throughout their struggles.

As for the quality of their clothing, it is TO DIE FOR! I honestly have never owned such nice clothing and it makes me feel great to know I'm supporting a small business who really cares for what they do. I own a ringer tee and a shop girl dress and I love them both so much. The fabric is very sturdy and high quality, but incredibly soft. They don't sacrifice comfort for quality or vice versa at all! Everything has a nice stretch to it too, so you're almost better off ordering a size down as its sure to fit snug! I cannot wait to add more of their clothing to my wardrobe in the near future< /Review>

<review>This is an amazing brand!! I've only purchased from them once (I got the Perfect Fanny Pack) and plan to purchase from them many more times when I have the means. Until then I'll be sportin' my sick fanny pack (which btw can hold a nintendo switch, with the joycons attached, perfectly) and dreaming of someday wearing one of their jumpsuits.< /review>< Pics>

I ordered a jumpsuit through the Kickstarter and was so amazed by the quality and comfort that I have ordered two more since then. Their customer service is amazing, I had a little issue with one order and they were so healpful and responded extreamly fast. I hope I can visit their store one day!</Text>

The "not very good" customer service you\'re referring to is from our Kickstarter which has pretty clearly posted guidelines about our inability to return/exchange goods (which were posted before you pledged and are why the discounts were so steep!)

<review>The good thing first: The sale person, Harry, was very friendly and not pushy at all. I never felt pressured at all during my visit.

Regarding the rest of my experience:
Went there to take a look at 2 preowned cars, a 2016 Kia Sorento and a 2018 Hyundai Tucson. I called a week ahead to make sure that both are available. A day before the reached out to me and assured me that both cars would be ready.

When I showed up in the morning they told me that the Kia was actually not available because they had shipped it somewhere else a few days ago. First red flag.

I still wanted to take a look at the Hyundai. On the outside it looked fine. Inside however, it looked like that hadn't really bothered to clean the car. The backseats had weird spots and I don't know whether they actually had tried to get rid of them. There were a bunch of paint like smears that should have been removed prior. When I looked at the trunk there were still some shopping receipts the previous owner had lost there, plus it didn't look like they had properly vacuumed.

It seemed to have a mechanical issue but that is not something you can blame them for. I left without buying the car.<//review><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None</Response><gmap_id>0x80859a1f00217e19:0x2e0ce028b598b928<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

My experience with this dealer was fantastic.  Very helpful and attentive.  In years past, our experience was not good (with service) and I avoided getting the car serviced.  I was very pleasantly surprised to see how attentive, polite, and helpful all were in the service area.
I will not hesitate to bring our Infinity back for service in the future.  This team is the best they've had in many years.</Text>

I brought my Infiniti to Marin for an oil change.  I waited in the customer lounge while Pablo, my service advisor took care of the paperwork and set up the service. Everything was clean and spacious. Everyone wore masks.  My car was ready on time and it was a great experience.<//text>

I contacted Marin Infiniti because I was having  a problem that needed attention right away.  They told me to go right over there, which I did. Everyone at Marin Infiniti is helpful and courteous.  Their service department staff and technicians are experts at what they do.

Since a loaner car was not available late in the day, they had my car delivered back to my door when it was finished.

Very happy with this experience.</review>

<text>My wife and I were driving north from LA to Marin County to visit family when my Infiniti starting acting up on the I-5 near Coalinga.  The engine was hesitating so badly that I had to exit the highway and look on my smart phone for a nearby Infiniti dealer.  Of course there were none.  The closest dealer was in Merced, and I didn't trust a roadside repair service to identify, and fix, the problem.  I discovered there was a dealer in San Raphael, my destination point, and called there to find out if my car was safe to drive another 100+ miles doing what it was doing.  I spoke with David T. in the Service Dept of Infiniti of Marin.  After David listened to my description of the car's behavior, he said he thought it would be safe for me to drive to the dealership.  When I got to San Raphael I drove straight to the dealership and unloaded my car into my host's vehicle.  A couple of hours later, David called and said the mechanics had identified the problem ( two faulty spark plugs and a bad ignition coil).  After waiting a day for the coil to arrive, I got my car back and drove safely home.  David T. called me several times to keep my updated on the progress of the repairs, and I got back a freshly-washed vehicle to travel home in.  The dealership has a comfortable waiting area and a GREAT coffee machine.  Infiniti of Marin is a quality place to deal with.  Highly recommend.<//text><pics>None</pics>< resp>

< Review>
I recently purchased an Infiniti from a dealer not associated with Infiniti and wanted to have the car formally inspected. Making the appointment on line was very easy. Upon arrival I was greeted in a timely manner. The service manager explained the services, time involved and the cost and sent me on my way. I was offered a space to wait with a tv and coffee. I was informed periodically of the progress on my car during my 2.5 he wait. When the services were completed, I  needed further servicing so I was given directives from the service manager and an explanation about what had been done and a servicing schedule for my car and the range of costs involved for the next maintenance service.   Also, my car was washed. I thought the service was excellent, I will continue to bring my car to this dealership for services as long as I live in this area.<//Review>

<Text>Went into the dealership over the weekend, and got our vehicle sold. It was a quick and painless process. The Finance Director, Ben, made the transaction as smoothly as possible. Usually you spend hours in the dealership whether it’s buying or selling a car, but they were efficient and got out of there in less than an hour. They gave the best price for the vehicle compared to other dealership that I have visited. All the staff were wearing masks and had sanitizers everywhere. The place was clean. Happy with the experience here. If you’re in the market to buy or sell a vehicle come check them out. Ask for Ben and you’ll be in good hands.< /Text><user_id>111555520071349729824</user_id>< rating>

If you are looking for a no hassle-no pressure deal in searching for your next used vehicle then look no further.  Stop by Infiniti of Marin and make an appointment and request to see Kevin Wood.   I had been looking at their large selection of used trucks online for weeks.  I called and made an appointment to schedule a test drive of used 2020 Silverado 4WD I was interested in.  The general manager, Anthony, set up the test drive with Kevin.  From beginning to end they were courteous,  professional, and even tolerated our kids hanging out inside the showroom while it was raining outside.  I have never purchased from this dealership before, but would recommend others to give them a try.  I have been very happy with my new purchase and will give them another opportunity in the future when I need another vehicle.<//Text>

Service was unprofessional and disappointing. I felt pressured to do the repairs and ended up spending almost 1k repairing my window. When I left the shop my car’s antenna is as bent out of place. I also asked about checking a coolant leak and was told they didn’t find anything. When I took my car to a different shop they found the coolant leak in a deteriorated radiator. Infiniti of Marin did not even check... do not get service here.<//Review>

Service consultant Pablo was awesome 👌.  What we didn't like about this infiniti is that they did not have a loaner vehicle for us to use. So we had to rent a car from enterprise down the street and in total had to come out of pocket at around $500. We drove from Vallejo having my wife and 2yr old and my 7yr old with me, and was not compensated for the rental that was very disappointing. When infiniti of concord or even Fairfield was still around we were better taken cared of.<//Review>

From start to finish, everyone we encountered at Infiniti Marin was knowledgeable, and efficient.  I asked for a pre owned vehicle for my kids and I that was affordable and that I could come to the dealership only long enough to sign documents and then take the car home and Harry and his team did not disappoint.   I highly recommend Infiniti of Marin!</Review>

This place is horrible, waste of time and money. We bought a used jeep here a month ago, when we bought we were promised they could do any repairs necessary and provide a loaner car. Thats a lie! They said to take it somewhere else to be repaired. Apparently they can't diagnose a bad pully/tensioner. Nor do they car that when this brakes it'll leave my wife and kids stranded< /Text>

Pablo was extremely rude and unprofessional my entire experience. As soon as we arrived to the service center we weren’t greeted at all happily just “what’s your name and what service do you need” and that was after I said “hello and that I had an 11:20 appt”. Any infiniti in LA, our home, would have greeted us enthusiastically opened the door for us escorted us into the office and treated us like guests. He definitely gave off a jiffy lube vibe. After speaking in the parking lot he then asked me to come to his office. He didn’t offer me to sit, water, nothing and trust me I understand it’s COVID time. It had nothing to do with that, he’s clearly unhappy with his job and doesn’t care how he impacts others, he’s collecting a paycheck. Anyway he simply started reciting pricing and had me sign paperwork. Without escorting me to the waiting area, giving me an ETA, asking my plans and letting me know the shuttle service was shut down, being personable or a simple salutation he takes the keys and that’s that, I then proceeded with my fiancé and son to walk to a restaurant nearby. I realize when I get there I forgot to tell him I don’t want them to clean the inside of my car due to COVID. I’m pregnant and have my child with me. I call and he’s unavailable despite the fact I was literally the only one in the lobby at the time, that’s fine right no problem he got busy he will call back. I wait he doesn’t. I then see I can message him directly through the text messages infiniti of Marin provided during the virtual appointment setup process I do that. Long story short after calling 3 times and over 2 messages via text I still receive no reply but the secretary assured me she spoke with him directly and he would respect my wishes and ONLY clean the OUTSIDE of my vehicle. Mind you I said even after she spoke with him I need him to verbally call me as I want to make sure this is carried out. He NEVER called back despite my attempts and polite demeanor. I get a jiffy lube text while eating that read “your car is ready” from the EXACT messaging system I’d been texting him from but ignored. Every auto message so polite but that’s how he feels “your car is ready” he should address me with RESPECT and EVEN PRETEND that I’m a valued part of infiniti of Marin but he doesn’t care so that’s it. I say to my fiancé we’re never going back to this rude dealership. I can get an $80 oil change elsewhere and get real infiniti service to match. We return and guess what?? The car has been cleaned inside and out. How is this possible when I clearly stated verbal and via message that I didn’t want this and why I didn’t want it?! I tell Pablo “hey they cleaned the inside anyway” he literally shrugged and said “he told them not to”. He didn’t apologize or seem shocked or disappointed, HE DID NOT CARE. I say “I specifically took the time to tell you guys not to and they did, it’s NOT ok”. He said “ there’s nothing he can do about it because it’s done” THAT’S it! HORRIBLE SERVICE! I would have given no stars if possible. I got better service at a Mom and pop shop when I used to drive my college vehicle. The service I received was disgusting. I told him I would write this review and he told me to go ahead. I can’t be his only complaint with the type of attitude and utter disregard he gave. He should probably have been fired long ago because treatment like that is something that is constant. You can tell it’s not just a bad day, that’s a cancer in your dealership. I will not be spending anymore money with your dealership because of this incident and plan on reposting this publicly as others should know what they are walking into. It was a wonderful Saturday before this experience. As a business owner myself you should know energy and customer service  is so important. If you do not have that you have nothing. I hope that he will be properly reprimanded or even fired. Fired is not something I would say for someone normally but he’s a special case.< /review>

10/10 experience. Evan was everything you want in a salesman. He listened to my needs and found me the perfect car. Evan even looked up how to use certain features of the car to help me understand, who does that?? This guy.

Ben handled my finance and I really cant recommend him enough. I could keep ranting, but the simplest way of putting it is go see these guys. You'll be glad you did.</text>

Infinity of Marin literally made the experience of buying a car painless Jose was my sales person he was super understanding of my needs and was really nice. Ben over in finance is like Superman he moved mountains to make sure I was in a good car and that it had everything I need to succeed! Thank you guys so much .<//Review>

<rate>5</rate><text>BEST car shopping experience in the history of car shopping experiences.

Obviously with Covid, the experience was going to be different - I wanted to do AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE online/ phone and only go to the dealership to swap cars.

I started off my experience by going to another Infiniti dealership (won't mention where) to test drive, but subsequently had a terrible experience. Even via text it felt like they were trying to hustle me.

I looked around at other dealerships to check inventory, and came across a great offer (but for 2020 vehicle)... submitted an inquiry, and immediate the Manager (Anthony) reached out.

I was very clear about what I wanted, and what my situation was. Anthony truly listened and put together a sweet deal, and get this, for a 2021! Everything was done via email and a few phone calls (to exchange highly sensitive materials.) He gave me a great deal, and made is so seamless.

Added bonus; they're dropping the car off at our house and taking our old one to turn in. LITERALLY AMAZING.

I didn't feel the "sales pitch" or the hustle, I didnt feel like they were being shady. I felt supported, and got full transparency. Can't WAIT to get in our new car tomorrow. Thanks Infiniti of Marin.</text>< Pictures>

Just got my first Infinity! It was a great experience! I shopped around for other brand but ultimately John and Tony won my business! I don’t know that I have met two more straight forward people... especially on this car hunt! My car broke down and the need over the want had me in a rush. I didn’t want to get something I didn’t like so I am glad I ran into John. He knows all the information of the Infinity! Tony hashed our the finances and I was out of there in no time it felt like! Thanks again guys! You will be a recommend!!!< /Review>

<review>Fresh out of a bankruptcy, I knew I needed to get another vehicle. I was pretty skeptical about what I was going to be able to get, I was ready for the here’s your tiny little smart car or something economic like that. I really needed a larger vehicle For me and my family. They were so great in getting me into the right car. Surprising as well the options I was shown and I left very happy rebuilding my credit. It’s a first step but I’m glad I made the drive from Sacramento! It was worth it! Thanks again, your team was amazing!</review>< response>

<userid>109642223832350051739<//userid><review>I’m currently leasing a q60 red sport that i bought here and worked with Ameen 2 years ago and he was awesome. 2 years later i am extremely disappointed that i have contacted them THREE times about wanting to purchase accessories with my synchrony credit card points and NO ONE has known how that process works. I’ve been told they are going to find out and call me back but its been over a month now and NO ONE has called me back and i still have no answer?? I’m simply just trying to give these people money! At one point a guy named Eric who said he was the parts manager swore up and down he would call me back and never did....I then went down IN PERSON and talked to Bob who was fine at first telling me he didnt know but would have the GM call me. I then asked him if my vehicle had the compatibility for a radiant emblem and he said he didnt know. He said my assumption was probably correct and that was the straight answer he could give me, but how is i dont know a straight answer? he started getting super rude telling me “i didn’t want to go down this path” WHAT PATH? im simply just trying to get answers. this dude doesn’t know anything and he wants to get angry at me?? Working in parts is your JOB how do you not know what part goes where or at least how to find the answer?? He even told me he prides himself in customer service but i didnt get any honorable customer service?? He didnt even apologize once that this happened and that he would take care of me, he just wanted to hand me off to someone else who probably wouldnt call me!! their service department has horrible customer service and makes me extremely worried for when the time comes for when my lease is up what kind of customer service i’ll get?? Completely unacceptable.< /review><username>iliana saldana</username>< date>

360 turn around .New managment and knowledge staff .The new General Sales manager  (Mark) came and introduced himself  went over our options and after agreeing to the terms .we were in finance and out in 45 minutes .that was the shortest time I ever spent after a test drive and making a deal
I can say  things have really turned  around under the New manager Mark and his professional staff . I highly recommend this place ... you'll thank me you did .

The car I was interested in sold before I could make it to the dealership, but I spoke with a couple different people here and they were great. They didn’t try to pressure me and gave me all the information I needed about the car and called me right back when I had another question. Great customer service! 😀</review>

<text>If I could rate this place a 0 I absolutely would.
By far the worst place ever!
I have an Infiniti 2018 QX60 that I bought from concord Infiniti before they shut down. I loved my car and MAINTAINED it the way it should and never had any issues. Took it in the same day I witnessed smoke coming out from the exhaust, which I thought was odd but since I have extra warranty and great warranty I took it in. However, within 10-5 minutes service told me my engine was completely dead... “no life” I have only had this car for 1 year 4 months!?! How could this happen? They said they noticed “sludge” and unless I proved that I had maintained my car properly then warranty wouldn’t cover it.. guess what? By the grace of god I had receipts and took all of them in! A total of 5... so that should have been enough right? Well no! The service manager came back and said warranty declined my warranty. Two receipts by Napa Garage had done my oil change in two occasions and since they don’t have a system called “POS” they write in the service done on their order forms which have everything u need... license #, Name, address everything!! The service Manager told me over the phone that the receipts didn’t look accurate as the service order #’s were too close to each other? Like what??? I mean in other words his “thoughts” and assumptions are costing me over 8k???? I told him to call and confirm for himself or go to business and pull up video of those dates be my guest! Can’t believe anybody would think the way this guys did! So who would ideally put their business on the line to help me create something fake. ? NOBODY! That’s who!
Sales manager ended up calling and confirming my car was present and still wasn’t enough.. can’t believe people like this. I’ve been trying to contact CEO or owner of this plant.
Not to mention my car was in their possession a month ago where they did a inspection of my car and 30 things were checked by a mechanic at Infiniti of Marin, however the only thing not checked at all and failed to be looked at was the “engine Oil” tell me is the coincidence???? Don’t think so!
I think both David and Mark could have handled this better and spoke to warranty they way it needed to be presented and not with assumptions.
A lot of Infiniti’s are closing down and wouldn’t be surprised if this one is next. Management is horrible!
Think before you buy from people like this! You think Infiniti being so known and have nothing but expensive cars, the dealership and service would treat you better.. isn’t that why you buy more expensive? For the good stuff the good car and good service! I swear I think I would have been heard and treated better by going to Hundai or Kia< /text>< user_name>

{'time': 1582666978761, 'text': 'Response from David MacDonnell, Service Manager:\nWe are sorry to hear your continued displeasure with the decision made by the manufacturer regarding your engine replacement. It should be noted that this happened and at the drop of a hat we put you into a loaner without notice for almost two weeks and although the outcome was not to your liking, we undoubtedly treated you in a professional manner. We waited several days while invoices were collected and held off calling anything in until they were brought to us. To say we could have handled this in a more professional way is preposterous. Warranty coverage needed in this magnitude is 100% decided by the manufacturer and this was clearly outlined to you the first day you brought the car down. Again we apologize the manufacturer did not decide to overturn your situation.'}</Response>

<rating>1</rating><review>Long story short they attempted to add over 1000 dollars onto my sale price of the vehicle after I came back to the dealer on an agreed upon price by infiniti which had been discussed with the general manager. The manger became upset when I discovered this and tried to rationalize the price hike. The worst part is I get in the vehicle to drive it home and only thing that works is the AM/FM stereo. No bluetooth, no auxillary, or even usb. Voice commands dead. I messaged the sales guy and he said we should be able to bring it in and look at it. I said let me know a time and he never returned my messages. Totally poor and disppointing dealership. I would highly recommend not to go.

I would like to add that later I brought it down to service and they could not fix it. Told me I could go to a Ford dealer and send them the bill. Absolutely no help of getting it there or offer of a car to drive while it was serviced. They had oppertunities to make it right but were to lazy amd unconcerned.</review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

<Time>1576522811716</Time><Rating>5<//Rating><Review>I called up to the dealership inquiring about a 2018 QX60 they had for sale. This was on Dec 2nd around 8 or so. The guy that answered the phones was Justin. When I asked him about the vehicle he didn’t know what or where it was. He quickly began to tell me that whatever I needed to know would be available for me to look at online. I informed him that I wanted to know if it smelled like smoke or if it had any visible damage because I live a couple hundred miles away and I’m very interested in purchasing that particular vehicle. He then calls me back so I ask him what we can do on the price he said 27900 so I counter at 27000. He begins to tell me he wishes he could sell every car for 15000 dollars, but that his kids need to eat. The way he talks to customers is a horrible representation of a dealership. As a former car salesman, I sold over 25 cars a month. Even if I couldn’t discount a price, I wouldn’t have been rude to a customer. I would’ve been professional in the hopes that they returned or at least came in knowing their getting great service and a good deal.

Update: Made it right worked out something with these guys. I guess the guy that was helping me wasn't really up to date on the industry thoughts really haven't changed much about that. The GSM is a cool dude would send someone there again.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

<review>This dealership is awesome no pressure very accommodating see Harry Yee best car salesman I ever met.

So I am editing this review as I am just a little unhappy to say the least when we purchased the car it had a large deep scratch in the drivers side door along with noticeable scratches on the left side of the front bumper brought back to you and because of the weather & holiday season to come back after the holidays and they would take care of it awesome right? So we brought the car dropped it off you had the car for 3-4 days at your facility when we came back to get the car the scratch was still noticeable and there were horrible horrible swirl markers in the paint and the hood paint was actually burnt. This probably should have been sent out to a body shop.  So once again brought back to you and we were told that we could take the car to someone we trusted to correct these issues and the dealership would make it right. So we took it to our detail shop and got an estimate on what it would take to make this paint right sent the estimate in and was informed that the estimate was to high and that they would only cover a third of the cost, even thought we were told that the would make it right to our satisfaction, It has been over a month and we are still waiting on to see if that is going to happen as I feel we are getting the run around . Mind you this was not any damage that we did it, and we would really like to get our new car looking like a new car.<//review>< Pics>

<review>We went in just to look at a Jeep they had on display, and ended up being shown the entire Infinity line up. The salesman was incredibly knowledgeable, and friendly.

The only reason I rated this two stars at all was because they were able to get me funded but they sold me a vehicle that had a defective key and are not addressing the concern the warranty doesn't cover replacement of keys yet the the car left me stranded and I I was assured that I would be reimbursed for the cost of the key yet no one is returning my phone calls 5 days later I was sold a car with a defective key and now I have to get an attorney to address this issue this is not the way you treat a customer< /text>

<pictures>None< /pictures><review>After a painful back and forth wtih Nissan/Infiniti financing and the dealership to clear up an error in which my credit was damaged by 50 points Tex did follow through to help me get the letter needed by Nissan/Infiniti financing.  This process between Nissan/Infiniti financing and their dealerships really needs to be improved.  Thank you Tex for the follow up though!

+++++++
Terrible experience working with this dealership and Kris Texixeria (Tex) in their financing department.  I returned and bought out a leased car on August 27 that was due on August 28 and Nissan/Infiniti financing did not receive payment from the dealership until August 29.  I ended up with a late and outstanding balance on my account that was reported on my credit report.  When calling Nissan/Infiniti Financing they told me I have to get a letter from the dealership.  I called on a Friday to ask Tex to please help and he was terse and just wanted to get me off the phone, saying I'm busy, I'm looking at two screens, I am the only person here and I can't get to you until at the soonest Monday which is even a stretch.  WOW.  It would have taken 10 minutes to write a letter to resolve this issue that I should not have to be dealing with in the first place and he refused.  I wish I would have recorded him for entertainment and to post becuase he was so dismissive & rude that you'd think he was acting on a Saturday Night Live skit.  I would recommend to never do business with this dealership as they will NOT take care of their customers or give a care about your experience with them!  TERRIBLE TEX!!!

Take heed, this dealership screws up your financial paperwork, including my lease return and then Nissan/Infiniti financing makes you have to do the chase around between them and this dealership to clear it up.  You will waste hours.  You will get the run around.  If you have 5 hours to spare in your week sitting on hold and getting the run around when your leasing paperwork gets messed up then you should work with these folks.<//review><Response>{'time': 1576607782869, 'text': "Hi Louise, sorry about your experience but I'm glad it was finally all cleared up.

I purchased a vehicle in Dec 2018. My vehicle is a 2017 Dodge. A couple months after my check engine light came on- not a big deal only the gas cap. I called the dealership everyone was still very helpful. But I realize it was only because they want you to keep referring people which I was. Now that I haven't and reached out to them because my car starter/ alternator is having issues-(6/19/19) NO RESPONSE FROM GARY OR CHRIS. I reached out to Chris so I could go over my extended warranty but no answer. The issue I'm having is that I have a Dodge. Infiniti CANNOT do the repairs for Dodge so I have to send it to another dealership BUT I have to get approval from the GM. I've been back and forth on the phone with the extended warranty PORTFOLIO PROTECTION- who said I have to take it to where I purchased the vehicle, but again they cannot repair a Dodge vehicle. Plus the extended warranty said I had to call the place where I purchased the car and have them contact the extended warranty. This is too much. At this point I have no car to drive and have to pay additional to get it towed to Vacaville Dodge BUT cannot do this until the GM approves it, so it can be covered by the extended warranty. After all this waiting and me being told the GM should be there within a hour and a half no one is able to get in contact with the GM, so there's no telling when my car will be able to go to the shop and get repaired. It is now almost 5 and at 2 was I was told the GM should've been on his way there. NOW WISH I WOULD'VE WENT TO ANOTHER DEALERSHIP. I WILL NOT BE REFERRING ANYONE ELSE. AGAIN AS LONG AS YOU'RE WILLING TO REFER, THEY WILL BE YOUR GOOD FRIEND.
***Update to my review- Had I spoke to Tony C. from the beginning I doubt I would've had any issues. Didn't have his contact at the time. Once I spoke to him everything was taken  care of immediately. Although my 4th of July was a bummer without transportation I appreciate the time he took to make sure he got to the bottom of everything. I believe he is the best person to work with when purchasing a vehicle.<//review>

I live four hours away from the Marin Infiniti dealer in San Rafael, where I have to take my car for warranty work, difficult for me to arrange logistically. Bob Campbell in the Service division went above and beyond to accommodate my constrained time schedule; he special ordered parts and arranged the shop calendar so I could leave in time to return home. All staff members were genuinely pleasant, businesslike, and very helpful. I have never written a review before but do gladly now, I was mightily impressed with Infiniti of Marin.< /Text>

< Review>
We are currently having one of the worst experiences with Infiniti of Marin. Please, anyone looking to lease or purchase a vehicle from Infiniti of Marin, just don't! They tack on excessive and unethical fees. Our lease is coming to an end and we were really excited to be purchasing our lease. When we first got our lease there were no issues. Little did we know the nightmare we are about to encounter. We went to get our loan from our local bank and got a great quote. Then we get a call from the bank saying Infiniti won't let them do the loan because we need to go to Infiniti and do the loan through them. So FYI if you think you can go and get your own loan after your lease, nope, you have to go Infiniti where they will tack on any fee they want.

So we spoke to John at Infiniti  and he gave us what our payments would look like. He added an extra $1500 to my loan amount without Explaining why it was even on there and simply asked "how does this look? When I asked why there was an extra $1500 on the loan, all he said was "payoff (21,348.60) + lease to purchase conversation and safety/smog inspection ($1,495)" WHAT A RIP OFF! How do you add $1500 to my loan hoping I wouldn't question it! I simply requested that I only wanted a buy out inspection that should only cost $80! Furthermore after I asked for an itemized list of what included in the $1500 that was being tacked on, he could only come up with $785 worth fees that didn't even make sense .  $75 fee to ground the vehicle (for what?!) 2 hours at the shop for $160/hr. (Again for what?! Smog check? It's a 2016 Q50 with only 40k miles. I'm not getting the car serviced, we are buying the vehicle as is . That still doesn't even add up to the $1500nthat was tacked on.

Something just seems slimy about this location and corporate needs to get involved. We mentioned we were going to contact someone else because we feel they are lying and he just reiterated call the store and speak to my GSM, as if he doesn't want us to call anywhere else which just proves how slimy their being. He then calls us wanting us to speak to his GSM Tony. He transfers us to "Tony" who doesn't answer we actually don't even know who Tony is or whose voicemail for all we know. He messages us telling us he was with a customer?? In that case you shouldn't have transferred us that was very unprofessional to call us for the purpose to speak to someone who didn't answer the phone. We didn't even ask to speak to this person he transferred us and we don't even know the reason why??? The last conversation was John saying "I've been following up for months. It's not like I'm not trying to help. But if you can get a better deal from Roseville or Dublin, if their people are willing to waive everything for you, then i suggest going with them." I don't know what kind of customer service this is and I don't know how inconsiderate they can be when we mentioned we have a 1 month old baby which has been our priority. How can you tell someone who you know has a one month old go to Dublin to see what they will do for you. SPEAKS VOLUMES TO WHAT "CUSTOMER SERVICE" WE ARE DEALING WITH AT INFINITI OF MARIN. I would never expect service like this from a dealership like Infiniti and honestly has tainted the brand for me and you guys should also think if you want to own something from a brand that treats their customers like this. Corporate Infiniti probably has no idea the people representing their brand and ripping off their customers. I don't understand why we were not told we can't just go get a loan somewhere else after our lease is over, it has to be done by one of them so they can add all these ridiculous fees. $160 per hour to store my car and we don't even know why. PLEASE EVERYONE BEWARE BEFORE PURCHASING OR LEASING HERE BECAUSE THEY ARE TACKING ON OUTRAGEOUS FEES AND SPEAK TO YOU AS IF YOUR THE PROBLEM FOR TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHY THEY ARE TRYING TO RIP YOU OFF!< /Review>

{'time': 1568658271190, 'text': '9/16/2019  While we appreciate your loyalty to INFINITI , there are procedures for buying out your lease. I\'m sorry you didn\'t understand the breakdown, please refer to the back of your lease.\n\n16. PURCHASE OPTION\nYou have the option to purchase this Vehicle "AS IS" from the originating dealer, or other location we specify, in cash for the Purchase Option Price, plus any official fees and taxes, vehicle inspection costs required in connection with the purchase, and a Purchase Option Fee of $300, which fees taxes and costs are not included in the Purchase Option Price agreed to in Section 6. If you purchase the Vehicle at the end of the lease term, the Purchase Option Price will be the Residual Value shown in Section 5.d. If you purchase the Vehicle before the end of the lease term, the Purchase Option Price will be the Adjusted Lease Balance disclosed in Section 15.

While you were NOT HERE EITHER TIME your reviews were written, I do not know how you can write about how the purchase transpired. No intimidation was used, or will it be ever. Our door was never closed to anyone. I did ask him to have you adjust your review, as I did go over all the information that wasn\'t understood the first time. My finance manager explained the breakdown and after we made sure your husband, WHO WAS HERE, was completely comfortable with the numbers and the purchase. Congrats again.'}< /response>

I am on my 3rd Infiniti and one of the reasons I keep buying them- in addition to the fact it is a great car- is the service department at Infiniti Marin.  I have found them to be very reliable and trustworthy.  They never recommend repairs unless they are necessary.  For example, I have over 74k miles on my 2007 M35, and have still not have to had the brakes redone.  Every time I go in for an oil change, I inquire about whether the brakes should be relined, and I have always been told that they are still good, they'll recheck next time.  Their prices are very competitive, and I wouldn't think of taking my car anywhere else.<//Review>

<Review>Infiniti Marin's service is exceptional.  My first experience was while driving through San Rafael.  I rarely need repairs, which is why I always buy Infiniti, but I needed immediate service on a sensor.  It was after the service department closed but there were still a couple salespeople about ready to close for the evening.  One of them got my ticket started for when service opened the next morning and drove me to a nearby hotel.  He went out of his way to help me out when he could have told me to just leave the car there and taxi to a hotel.  I've had a few more great experiences since and they are always a pleasure to work with.  I have two Infiniti's and won't go anywhere else.<//Review><GmapID>0x80859a1f00217e19:0x2e0ce028b598b928<//GmapID></record>

Since the ownership change it's exhausting to just think about needing service.  IF you can get someone on the phone, odds are that they will have no idea what they're talking about ( and all of the "uh, oh, ummm, well, yeah" doesn't help).  Service prices have skyrocketed.  Ownership seems to feel they know more about what the car needs than that people that designed it.  Not only are rates higher, the standard service for whatever mileage milestone is WAY more than the car and warranty need.  Their explanation was "Well we just want to be sure the you're taken care of".   They also  reset my car to now say it needs an oil change at 3,000 miles.  Yep, way to go Infiniti Marin.   Way to gouge clients.  Sadly, to keep my warranty in order, it's this dealership or one that is much less convenient.  When it's time to buy another car, this dealership won't make my list.</text>

<Text>If I could give it zero stars I would.The service Department at this dealership is absolutely the worst since the new ownership took over!!. I had to bring my car in 6 times for the airbag recall. Every time I picked up the car, something had been broken during the installation of the new airbag. They NEVER answer the phone and you are lucky to receive a call back if you leave a voice message. I am even considering changing car brands due to the pathetic service at this location. Two of my neighbors that also own Infinitis, also have had similar problems, so it isn't just me!! Time to revamp the service department< /Text><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

During the summer of 2010 I purchased an 06' G35 that had a rare engine defect . It was an incredibly worrisome situation that caused a great deal of stress. Infiniti of Marin took the proper steps to investigate the issue and ended up replacing the engine as the vehicle was still covered under warranty. Ever since, I have been taking my car to them for service, new tires, minor repairs etc. Jay and the rest of the service team are all incredibly knowledgeable, professional good people who I have complete trust in. There is not another place that I would go for service or any other need for my vehicle period. To really drive my point home, I was recently looking at possibly buying a vehicle from another manufacturer and the main reason that I decided not to do so was the level of service that I receive at Infiniti of Marin.< /review>

<Review>This has to be the one stop and shop of new and used cars. I would have to say the sales manager Tony Christy is an outstanding salesman, easy to talk to and very knowledgeable of the business. There's no haggling, he brings it on home for you and believe me you'll get the best deal like I got. When I buy my next car, I guess you know where I'm buying it and the person I'm buying it from, I give my auto experence a FIVE STAR RATING to Infiniti Of Marin and sales manager Tony Christy."OUTSTANDING"< /Review><username>Daniel Llamas<//username><gmapID>0x80859a1f00217e19:0x2e0ce028b598b928<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Before the new ownership, this place was great.  Now the service has really gone downhill.  I partially bought my Inifiniti for the free car washes.  Now they say that they don't vaccuum the backseat.  They always did in the past.  The service is slower now and it is harder to get a loaner car.< /Review>

< review>
My wife and I have purchased our last three vehicles from Infiniti of Marin (two Infiniti's,a G35, a G37 and a '86 Porsche 911) and am a very satisfied customer.  I have always had the Infiniti's serviced at the Marin dealership and have always been very satisfied with the service of the vehicle (I appreciate the fact they wash the vehicle), all recall parts have been done promptly and professionally and I have never had a problem with an appointment or acquiring a loaner vehicle when needed.< /review>

Don't waste your time with these clowns. Made a reservation to look at a used BMW M4 they had listed on their site. When I show up, the salesman I was supposed to meet wasn't there so they handed me off to some other guy. He immediately starts trying to sell me on a new Infiniti (not what I'm looking for) and wanting to talk financing (I'm a cash buyer).

Their higher-end used cars are all in an indoor showroom where they're trying to pretend a bunch of used BMWs, Lexuses and Corvettes are Pebble Beach or something. The salesman knew nothing about the car and quoted me a price about $8k more than what it's listed for on their site.

They refuse to do test drives of anything in their pre-owned showroom. I understand "no test drive" rules on new performance cars, but five more miles on an 18,000 mile bimmer isn't going to change anything. It's a used car, not a vintage Ferrari. At the very least they could have informed me of their chickensh*t policies when I booked the appointment and not wasted my time with an hour round trip.<//review>

Never would purchase another Infiniti again nor would recommend anyone to buy one. Not because the brand isnt good or anything but just for the fact that Infiniti would not engage with you if the car is out of warranty and you run into some serious reliability problems.

This is not a bad reflection on Marin Infiniti itself; the service manager who attended to my car was very helpful and she was really sympathetic to my issues. However, the way Infiniti distanced itself from the issue saying it is a older car speaks volume about their customer engagement.

Wear and tear on moving parts are pretty normal on a old car. This is normal. However, I had issues with overheating, TWICE, and both times I was left stranded. Paid a huge amount of money of course but this is not due to usage. This is some inherent issue with the car itself I believe but Infiniti wouldnt even look into it. They are more than happy to keep servicing the car which is a money pit for them anyways. First time, they said something blocked the radiator causing it to blow out and next time, the fans on the radiator was intermittently not working. I dont know how usage can cause issues like this.

Contacting Infiniti directly wasn't any help either. Paying premium money for Infiniti is just a waste since the car isnt reliable at all. If under warranty, go for it. If not, just walk away from the car.<//Text>

< Review>
I just called this dealership to ask about a transmission fluid swap for my 2002 q45 they had a woman service writter and the back up service writter was a woman to. Not to be shovenistic but she asked me if it was a stick or automatic lol They never maid a stick q45 al the way back to 1990. Clearly this is a service department that has no clue what they are talking about. I called the part department and talked to the guy. I told him what I thought all he could do is laugh. This dealership is a joke wow, i might ass well call jiffy Lube and ask them question about my $64,000 car.  Two thumbs down for infiniti stick with Nissan way better service department.< /Review>

Christian the sales manager was rude.  Checked his phone while I was talking to him.  He didn't want my business. They don't haggle at all on used cars. Didn't advertise as such.</text>

<Text>This is not my regular smoke shop, but I stopped in to grab something as I was in the area. The experience I had was a breath of fresh air in an age where quality customer service is at a rapid decline. I can’t remember the last time I dealt with someone so genuinely kind, welcoming, and helpful while shopping. Thank you, Cynthia, for the stellar service! I will now go out of my way to make Purple Haze my go to smoke shop because of you!

My only regret is I can’t give more stars!

10/10 WILL recommend!</Text><user_id>113091391981106727382</user_id><Date>1563131321782</Date><Name>David Shaw<//Name></record>

A couple of my people and I decided to try this place out for calzones considering their ratings. The place is a whole in the wall and they had a decent amount of traffic. I ordered 3 calzones and the total came out to 44 and change, we waited for about 40 minutes and our food finally came out, we ate outside and when I pulled out the calzones and the size was impressively big but they were just wrapped in like a sandwich wrap. Pulling them out we broke them open and oh my goodness it dripped in oil, I poured it out to make it somehow enjoyable, I had the vegetarian, my buddy had the ground beef and cheese, my other had the special and we all had the same issue but theirs not as bad I'm assuming because the beef soaked up the oil. Overall it was a disappointing order for what I paid, I'm sure their other stuff is good (I hope) and the staff was kind. The review was solely on the calzone. Won't be ever ordering that again here!< /Text>

<text>The combo pizza was good, it has a good mix of flavors. The only thing I did not like was the crust. It was a bit too dry and hard to chew but everything else was good.< /text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPSISchiLROsYa5WW-k4FsmYMy7nWLP8o_sMJqM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

< review>
We placed an order through door dash. When it arrived the pasta was full of sugar instead of salt. We couldn’t eat it, so I called the restaurant and Samantha answered the phone. When I told her about their mistake she said became hostile and rude to me. She said they knew there was sugar in the pasta versus salt and wouldn’t give me a refund even though I didn’t ask for one. I told her that I wanted to speak to a manager and she said they didn’t have a manager, only owners. I asked to speak to the owner then and Samantha said no!  She said the owners told her to deal with the problem about the sugary food. Then Samantha told me I was “giving her attitude and she wasn’t going to help me and she was getting off the phone because she had customers “.

This was the most unprofessional restaurant I have EVER dealt with. All we wanted was to exchange the food but this RUDE girl was incompetent as well as the restaurant. How can you not exchange food when you made the mistake not doordash?  WE WILL NEVER GO TO THOS RESTAURANT AGAIN ESPECIALLY IF THE OWNERS CAN’T COME TO THE PHONE AND JUST ADMIT YOUR MISTAKE.

There are too many restaurants out there who can have our business and will take pride in their food versus a horrible place like this.

I WOULD GIVE A ZERO FOR A REVIEW BUT THATS MOT AN OPTION.<//review>

We ordered a lg pineapple with Canadian bacon and a deep dish with pepperoni, olives and fresh mushrooms. Both were requested light sauce and well done. Both pizzas were done on time for pick up.
The staff were very friendly as well as accommodating and offered up options when we requested light sauce they were more than understanding, if not in agreement that sometimes light sauce is better.
I would be more than happy to recommend them to anyone I know as well as return for more pizza in the future. Thank you again for the hospitality.< /text>

Cannot say enough good things about this business. They know how to take care of their customers. Have been stopping by for a the best thin New York style pizza for several years. Never disappointed, pizza is always hot and flavorful. The cheese and crust is always the right texture and on point. Owner always made time to conversate as well. Even though I didn't wait long, they gave me some delicious bread with an amazing dipping sauce. I have ordered a full pizza here before and can say I rather have their slices. It's still good but just different in texture and bite.

One gripe is that the slices usually comes out super hot and I would suggest to the owner that it be served on paper plate instead of styrofoam. It is so hot, you can see melted styrofoam. I'm not a Toxicologist, but who knows what sort chemical is coming from that. Didn't stop from eating it still, lol. So good, I would definitely recommend to everyone!</text>

<text>Mama Mia's is that little holeinthewall place that serves the comfort food one has a craving for, sure it's like most little places, it's a bit informal in appearance, located in a strip mall that has seen better days, but this family owned business consistently turns out quality.
They have done well enough to open another location in the Tower District which is testament enough to prove my point about consistent quality comfort food.<//text>< userid>

<Text>Food is very good, but the place is also very dirty.   If you work in a place every day, you stop noticing the dirt. (Hint: Look up by the cash register). They should announce a one day closing and hand out to every employee cleaning rags and disinfectant and scrub every thing.  Use to love the place, but I have stopped coming.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

This happens to be the place with the best Italian food in Fresno, I’ve been coming here for years and the reason is it’s great.  Normally I get the Rigatoni with a spicy red Alfredo sauce.  My wife is a vegetarian and Mike makes it with no meat for me and it is so good.  Another traditional Italian delicacy is the BLT and they have the best one.  And yes it is a traditional Italian and Spartan delicacy.  In 415 BC when Athens was going to invade Syracuse the Syracusians asked Sparta for help.  Had to do with same ancient blood lines.  Anyhow the Spartans agreed and brought their secret sandwich the BLT and taught the Syracusans how to make them, well protecting this recipe was critical and they beat the Athenians.  Don’t bother googling this info it’s been passed down word to mouth for generations, my Yiya told me.

Garlic cheese bread, hamburgers (Mike and Amy burger), fries, all the best pastas you can imagine are here and are so good.  I am not a paid spokesman but have a well educated palate and know great food.  I read a review where someone said it didn’t look clean, I don’t agree.  It looks perfect.</Review>

<review>So the food was great however I was a little disappointed by the service. I called my order in and was told it would be ready in 20-25 minutes. When I got there I was told it would be another 15-20 minutes. After waiting 20 mins I was told it was another 7 minutes. I was upset because I had to be across town in 10 minutes. When I asked if they could refund my money a young  blond lady jumped into action. She was able to get my order expedited and got me out the door. I must reiterate, the food was great. Fortunately I was a couple minutes late to my appointment but it worked out. I just ask the ownership to set proper expectations. I do understand things come up and things happen.<//review><Rate>4</Rate>< username>

Best pizza in fresno. Their dough is incredible. My favorite is their Pizza Bianca deep dish style. Perfect combination of cheesey garlicky buttery goodness. Their spicy red alfredo is to die for.</review>

Excellent pizza!  Although there are a couple of tables, this is more of a takeout place.  If you decide to eat in, you will get warm focaccia bread with pasta dipping sauce.  So good!< /review>

<Text>Really tasty crust!! Gets busy on Thursdays and Fridays. Otherwise great tasting pizza. The cheese is better than at Popolo's Pizza. It is slightly more expensive (about a dollar or two depending on toppings), however.<//Text>< name>

My favorite pizza by far! They gave me a roll while waiting for my pizzas. It made me realize that when the free roll was that good, the pizza dough must be amazing. And it was! So good! It's so simple to make good food and yet so many people don't. They do here though! Great dough with great cheese, sauce, and toppings. It's as easy as that. The calzone was awesome too.< /review>

<Review>Went in looking for some authentic east coast style pizza, and walked right back out after looking at the prices! This place is TRASH. who even pays for 5$ For one slice of pizza? Back on the east coast you can get two large pizzas for their one large pizza here. And it tastes 10 x better. DONT go here. Even in NY city they don’t tax and cost this much on their pizzas like they do here at mama Mia’s<//Review>< user>

<Review>The place was smaller than I expected, about the size of your average dominos or carryout shop lobby. Three tables inside and a couple outside. But the atmosphere was nice and the customer service was fantastic and pleasant. The cashier told us the specials of the day and got us to order a larger sized pizza than we planned based on that special! He offered us delicious fresh baked rolls with dipping sauce while we waited. I like to think of myself as a bit of a connoisseur of pizza, and this place knows their pies. Everything about it was delicious; crust, sauce, and cheese. Their largest size and a drink totaled about $20 and I'd say it was worth it.</Review><pictures>None</pictures><Date>1432590323391< /Date>< userid>

I called 4 times and each time I was placed on hold for 3 1/2 minutes. Then finally when she came back on she said they were super busy and had alot of people. I live right around the corner. It was not that busy to get left on hold and no apology from her. Manager was very apologetic. Didn't order and won't ever again.<//text><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

We ate at this restaurant while visiting from out of town,  and our concierge at the Hilton double tree in Fresno recommended us to this restaurant.  We ordered a gluten free Hawaiian pizza since I have Celiac Disease,  and after about five hours, I experienced severe cramping and diarrhea that I have not felt in a very long time due to a strict Celiac friendly diet.  So,  thank you to the staff of this restaurant for one of the most painful flare ups that I have ever had.  And for the love of all that is holy,  do not order the gluten-free pizza.</Text>

<review>Lots of well-deserved, mixed reviews here.  I've had good pizza here, in the past.
However...last visit, 26 Jan 2018 to Bullard location, was bedlam: was on hold for 5 mins 36 secs, the meth addict under-cooking my pizza in the back was swearing n complaining the whole time, the front desk was talking about quitting, and the place was filthy.  Not a good visit.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None< /Response>< gmap_id>

Not only was the bruschetta hot and on dinner rolls (one bite was too much to choke down), the tortellini was mushy and served with a curdled looking pink sauce.
My fault for eating food that cost me over $36.00. Never. Again. Will I eat here.<//text></record></dataset><record>

I would give them a 5 star, but when they gave my order to another person in front of me they made me wait nearly 20 minutes parked in front with hazard light's on & kids in the vehicle. Now I understand mistakes happen & I felt bad for the young lady at the window that made the mistake who was worried about getting in trouble, which she shouldn't because it was a simple mistake being supposedly the driver in front of me who got my food also happened to share my name. The reason for the low rating is merely because of waiting so long with ZERO compensation or barely an apology. McDonald's makes it up to you with like a free fry or a pie, but Chick Filet... Cheap cheap cheap could care less about you & your kids waiting for nearly 20 minutes with ZERO compensation. Almost makes me not want to go back. To me, making it up to the customer should be the focus. They didn't care... I think they should work on that. A multimillion dollar franchise & Zero compensation for their screw up let alone making a parent & the kids wait, hungry, tired, bored, uncomfortable, at night, for that long with no compensation. Not cool...<//text>

This Chick-fil-A has a 2-lane drive-thru for placing orders, but unlike other Chick-fil-A restaurants, this doesn't help the line move quickly. Every time I have been to this location, the service is very slow and there's usually a problem with my order, either something missing or the chicken is poorly cooked. It usually looks like the chicken nuggets have been fried 2 or 3 times, leaving them burnt and dry. How can a restaurant built on fried chicken nuggets not be able to fry chicken properly? Never had this happen at other locations.<//review>

<text>Looking for good service? Want a restaurant that will honor your CFA points? Hoping for an accurate order? You’ve come to the wrong place—the Auburn CFA on 2755 Grass Valley Hwy is terrible! Team Lead & Management=Awful customer service. They won’t honor your points (expect to hear excuses like “technical glitch” or “call customer service” or “we don’t know why it’s not working”). On top of that, they got my order wrong—more than once!

Spend your money money elsewhere. Most other CFA’s are terrific. This definitely isn’t one of them!<//text>< Pics>

Over the last several years I have become more and more frustrated with the level of what passes for service. So many employees act like you should be honored that they bother to serve you. This place is one of the best exceptions I've seen in years. Despite the dining room being closed for covid-19, three different people came out to check on us as we waited for curbside service,  and the wait was brief
All were professional and pleasant. This place deserve 6 Stars for the quality of its employees!< /review>

<date>1591124342459<//date><text>We ordered 2 of the chicken egg white sandwich meal gluten free for a total of $19.71.
The chicken was smaller than the ketchup packets we got with the meal and the eggs were about the same size as the ketchup packets. So essentially we were charged $20 for 2 bread sandwiches (the gluten free bun is edible but only tastes decent if most of the sandwich is meat/other ingredients), 2 small tater tots disks, and 2 cokes. Sadly the cokes were the best part of a $20 meal ☹️< /text><rating>1</rating><pics>None<//pics></record></dataset><record>

I have a few favorite: Cobb salad, grilled and crispy, spicy chicken sandwich. I don't put any condiments on my food, because the food taste great without it.</Text>< Pictures>

<text>It was my first time in a Chick-fil-A. It's a different kind of fast food for sure. Not really many options on the menu. Similar to In-N-Out, they are banking on keeping it simple. I got a spicy chicken sandwich and it was delicious. The criss-cut fries that came with it were cold. It was a cool place that seemed to attract a certain type of crowd. Being a dirty working blue collared customer, I definitely felt out of place. Everyone was super nice. I enjoyed my sandwich and dipping my cold fries in a large assortment of interesting and tasty sauces.</text><UserId.>100190508559942699990< /UserId.></record></dataset><record>

On this visit i ended up going inside to place my order. It is open, bright, & much larger than I expected. I love the fact that the condiments are self-serve. I really hate the way some places ration ketchup as if it were gold. And as always, everyone was friendly and attentive. If you haven't tried it, you are missing out.</Text><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

<Review>I was so looking forward to trying Chick-fil-a. My first time, and I heard such good things. My very good friend and I chose this as our reunion place to have lunch.
I really feel bad saying this but, it was very disappointing . Fries were half warm and the other half cold. Grilled chicken sandwich  was actually cold.  Chicken nuggets were tough, and tasted as if they had been sitting out for awhile. The bun was tasty.
But, as I looked up one of the employees  used her shirt top to wipe her nose and then went right into the kitchen.</Review>< Date>

Went here for lunch and went through the drive thru. They were very busy but the line passed quickly. The service is top notch. They have the nicest employees. I even asked for extra sauce and they gave it to me!</Review>

First time to this Chick-fil-A and I was blown away. With customer service that is falling by the wayside today this place rocks! Woman took my order correctly and politely and again said "it was my pleasure" when I picked up my food. All the employees looked well groomed and dressed correctly. And I even got a smile which is sometimes hard to find today! Amazing customer service! Food was good too.</Text>

<Text>Despite being heavily joked about on social media for their Sunday day-off, the food here sets this place among my favorite places to visit in Auburn. As an unfortunate victim of chronic stomach diseases, I find comfort in their wide selection of spicy and greasy foods, as they retain their edibility while also satisfying my cravings. Prices are moderate: more expensive than the likes of McDonald's or Burger King, but the quality and filling nature of Chick-fil-A's food is enough to make someone choose this restaurant over another.</Text>< pictures>

My daughter and sister ❤️ Chick-fil-A!  It is there 'go to' place.  I've had a few bites, and it was good.  Cute interior with plenty of room.  Delivery through Door dash, order to pick up, and drive thru make it convenient.  Good location, lots of parking, and a variety of stores to get several errands done at one time.  Handicap parking available.< /Review>

Always good food and friendly staff...
Only reason they dont get a 5 star is that they will no longer make extra crispy fries and the regular ones are a bit to soft for my liking< /text>

Profit is not a four letter word!
Heard of a principled christian restaurant and wanted to support them any way I could.  I ordered a chicken wrap.  Was a little taken by the price but thought I’d give it a try.  Very disappointed. What I got was a wrap, a single piece of large leaf lettuce and a hand full of chicken pieces.
All for over $8 and change.  I’m more than willing to pay a fair price for a fair product and profit is not a four letter word. But come on.
Lost customer</review>

45 minutes, it took 45 minutes at 9am on a Saturday to get a breakfast burrito in the drive thru, my buddy had time to run over to Starbucks to grab coffee for us and I was still sitting in the drive thru... No apology or even acknowledgement of me wasting close to an hour in the drive thru.< /review>

First time here. Waffle fried were amazing. Spicy chicken sandwiches actually are spicy and have a little kick unlike most other so called spicy sandwiches. Will definitely eat here again.<//Text>

Least attentive Chick-fil-A. The drive thru employee was so focused on the spelling of my name that she got the order wrong. Then at the window after correcting the order they still botched it up. Missing a sandwich that I paid for sucks! Please focus less on my name and get the order straight!<//Text>

The food was very good and the staff were friendly. There seemed to be an issue with the carbonated beverages from two machines being flat. The staff were helpful in replacing it when I tried to get a different machine, but I gave up and asked for a different drink after there was no improvement on the soda.</text>

Sooooo ridiculously slow. Waiting 15 minutes for a take out order when there’s hardly a line in drive thru and a single other customer in the dining room is ridiculous.< /text>

<text>The market salad was delicious! It was loaded with several different types of fresh fruit and nuts,   fluffy greens and a generous portion of shredded chicken breast. The salad was very refreshing and very satisfying.  I will definitely order it again!</text>< Pictures>

So I'm sitting in my car there were three people ahead of me... It's been 12 minutes... still not at the window.   What is it with fast food not being fast anymore.   Seems like a growing trend.   Now its been 15 minutes.   Totally unacceptable.  Three year old is getting restless,  infant is crying.... went be going here again<//Review>

Good service, clean facility with very nicely decorated seating. They bring you your food if you're dining in, with offers for drink refills when passing our booth, asking if everything is ok. Oh, and the chicken club with waffle fries are delicious. The lemonade alone is reason enough to go there!</Review>

Maybe I caught them on an off afternoon, (which is why I gave them 2 stars instead of 1 star) they were not at all busy. They were fully staffed so no excuse there. They were able to keep up with their cell phones texting etc, chatting with each other. My order was taken quickly and courteously and all down hill from there. Ordered a presumably all ready prepared salad. Then waited. And waited. Just at 9 and a half minutes! Then again courteous as she handed me the salad. No explanation, no apology. No hurry to go back to this location.< /Review>

Great service, as always. Chick-fil-A is as classy as conventional fast food gets, and they are not stingy on sauces. Great food, friendly staff, and it is practically a sit down restaurant when managed well. Almost makes you want to tip. I will be back. Again. And again. And again.<//Review>

I've been to Chick-fil-a restaurants all over the country and this was the only one that could not handle the crowd and served cold fries.  We were very disappointed after driving 3 miles off the freeway just to eat lunch here.</review>

<Rating>1<//Rating><text>THE WORST CHICK-FIL-A.  I’m a big fan of Chick-fil-A and often dine at them. This one is Auburn is the slowest and most unorganized one I’ve ever been to. As I sit and wait for 40 minutes watching order after order come out wrong and management blame “the people in the back” for everything going wrong. “The people in the back don’t know what their doing and are getting everything wrong.” I overheard them say to someone at the drive thru. Maybe it’s just the time of day or the poor training, but I have never experienced this before at a Chick-fil-A. Lots of people leaving and getting refunds.  It will be “my pleasure” to leave this place and not come back...
Update: I left after an hour of waiting and countless excuses. I left with no food in hand. It was only ten breakfast sandwiches. What a joke of a leadership team they have here. Avoid this place, go somewhere else.<//text><pics>None< /pics><response>None</response>< gmap_id>

<Text>I've lived in three states- Colorado, California, and where Chick-fil-A was founded, Georgia.  I've been to my fair share of Chick-fil-A's and this one stands out from the rest for being absolutely awful.  Starting with the drive-thru line, it takes at least 10 minutes to get your food even with a couple cars in front of you, while the CFA's I know crank out 15-20 cars in that same time frame.  Inside, the service us just as slow and the employees just seem to be there and not really care about what their actual job is.  But I can't pin it on them, it starts with management, specifically the operator.  I interviewed for a job here as well, and surprise, in typical fashion they wouldnt even get back to me and even when they did they'd string me along saying they'd get back to me.  I eventually talked to the operator and she lied TO MY FACE telling me that they currently were not hiring, which was a complete lie since you don't interview someone if you're not hiring, not to mention there are signs all around the interior saying they ARE hiring.  Abysmal management always sets the tone for a workplace and that's why this Chick-fil-A is so bad at even the basics, they barely even say "my pleasure."  This place is the exact opposite of every standard Chick-fil-A sets, if corporate found out about this place they would have a field day with that operator.<//Text>< resp>

<review>I've lived in three states- Colorado, California, and where Chick-fil-A was founded, Georgia.  I've been to my fair share of Chick-fil-A's and this one stands out from the rest for being absolutely awful.  Starting with the drive-thru line, it takes at least 10 minutes to get your food even with a couple cars in front of you, while the CFA's I know crank out 15-20 cars in that same time frame.  Inside, the service us just as slow and the employees just seem to be there and not really care about what their actual job is.  But I can't pin it on them, it starts with management, specifically the operator.  I interviewed for a job here as well, and surprise, in typical fashion they wouldnt even get back to me and even when they did they'd string me along saying they'd get back to me.  I eventually talked to the operator and she lied TO MY FACE telling me that they currently were not hiring, which was a complete lie since you don't interview someone if you're not hiring, not to mention there are signs all around the interior saying they ARE hiring.  Abysmal management always sets the tone for a workplace and that's why this Chick-fil-A is so bad at even the basics, they barely even say "my pleasure."  This place is the exact opposite of every standard Chick-fil-A sets, if corporate found out about this place they would have a field day with that operator.< /review><pics>None</pics><Response>None<//Response><GmapID>0x809b100e0c202b3f:0xef9a6a3e0732a967<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

THE WORST CHICK-FIL-A.  I’m a big fan of Chick-fil-A and often dine at them. This one is Auburn is the slowest and most unorganized one I’ve ever been to. As I sit and wait for 40 minutes watching order after order come out wrong and management blame “the people in the back” for everything going wrong. “The people in the back don’t know what their doing and are getting everything wrong.” I overheard them say to someone at the drive thru. Maybe it’s just the time of day or the poor training, but I have never experienced this before at a Chick-fil-A. Lots of people leaving and getting refunds.  It will be “my pleasure” to leave this place and not come back...
Update: I left after an hour of waiting and countless excuses. I left with no food in hand. It was only ten breakfast sandwiches. What a joke of a leadership team they have here. Avoid this place, go somewhere else.</review>

Just like back in Georgia, this Chick-fil-A makes me feel like I'm back home. EVERYONE is very friendly and the food is out quick. Where else can a displaced Southerner get sweet tea in California 😉< /text>

I had ordered chicken nuggets and I got some grilled chicken in a container.  Disappointed because I have never had a problem before.  It's not enough to keep me away, but I was disappointed.</Text>

<Rate>3<//Rate><Review>Only giving this Chick Fil A a 3* because of its service. They have certainly improved in the realm of employees with customer service but as far as quality it has not. I cant even tell you how many times we have bought to go salads and they forget the dressing and condiments pack that goes with it. I ordered a large fry the other day and the box was filled below half way. May as well have ordered a small. I was going to take it back in but decided not to waste my time. I love chick fil a but this one is pretty stingy and lacking quality.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

<text>I love this place but lately they have been giving me the wrong sandwich. I get the #1 deluxe and its just plain chicken. But ive been recieving the spicy chicken and its quite the surprise and heartburn. I dont say anything because i dont mind the spicy. But for ppl who cant handle spice please listen to what they order and put it in properly.</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

Everyone loves chick-fil-a. Chick-fil-a sauce is awesome sauce. Best service out of any fast food restaurant. Even their side salads are good.<//review>

So its great, as long as you like your food exactly as it's written on the menu. If you ask for American cheese on your spicy chicken sandwich, you're not getting it. Lol. So I personally won't be going back to this location, but other locations are usually great!< /text>< pics>

<review>Food is okay. They don't serve lunch until EXACTLY 10:30 on the dot. All other Chick-Fil-A places I've been to serve lunch anytime you just have to wait for them to cook it. But these people here don't do that. I got the manager/owners phone number, and texted several times, but apparently ignored my text messages cause I have NOT heard back. I now instead choose to drive all the way to Roseville/Rocklin Chick-Fil-A, and eat there. The people at the Rocklin location are very friendly, polite, and courteous! And hard working! Always there to make sure you're satisfied, but not the Auburn Chick-Fil-A, nope, not them. They're rude, and unfriendly!<//review>< Time>

Very good when in the mood for a chicken sandwich, however it's a pretty limited menu and they're closed on Sundays. So the bottom line is lack menu variety plus not being open on one of my more common days to eat out, means I won't be going here often.<//Text>

Waiting for a chicken sandwich should not be like waiting at the DMV.  Unfortunately, such is an accurate comparison  of my experience at Auburn Chic Fil A  on November 11th.  Auburn is a small town, and lately has had an increase in the saturation of fast food restaurants. Word travels fast, and if this business doesn't get it together, they won't last long.

It took 32 minutes to get my (very small) order. The amount of incompetence was overwhelming.  I got the overall impression the staff were having a bad day... everyone looked confused . It wasn't even busy (after lunch, I ordered at 2:31pm ).As I sat waiting, I had a chance to observe the other customers. They were just as frustrated as I was, to the point that some were telling customers coming through the door to not bother ordering. People were also getting wrong orders left and right. After 25 minutes, I formally complained at the front register ...

I run a business. I know that you BEND OVER BACKWARDS to make up a mistake to a customer, because business is about relationships, not numbers. Seemingly, Chick Fil A Auburn has yet to learn this.

I was not offered a refund.
I was not offered free food.
I was given a passing, half- hearted apology.

Make no mistake, I enjoy this food chain. But I don't want this experience again, and certainly wouldn't wish it on my friends and family either. Manager on duty was 'Justice' I believe.  Friendly, but incapable of keeping the ship from sinking, so to speak.  Shout out to an older gentleman, 'Steve' who was at least attempting to smooth things over. Hope things get better here... I'll check back in a few months.<//text>

Worst Chick-fil-A I've ever been to. Drive through took forever, then coffee was bad, they gave us the wrong sandwich (even though receipt was right) and we weren't given one of the sides for our meals.<//review>

I had an issue with my order and they resolved it extremely well. Since then, they stopped serving the bagel sandwich at breakfast, so sadly I will not be returning to chic-fil-a for breakfast in the future<//Review>

I like their salads. However, pricey. For a lemonade and a salad it was almost $12.00.</review>
