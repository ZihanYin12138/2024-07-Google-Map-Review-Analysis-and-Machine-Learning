Tasty house beers and good selection from other local breweries. The vegetarian/vegan options are plentiful and the Impossible Burger was so delicious. Service and ambiance were lovely as well. I can't wait to go back!< /review>

<text>Finally an official (Baltimore) Raven's bar downtown. Watching a Raven's game isn't quite the same unless you have other fans cheering with you. The food is really fresh and delicious. If there is something wrong, they will fix whatever the problem is. The staff want you to enjoy your visit and come back again. The vegan options are as good as every other option on the menu. Also, they have a vegan Bloody Mary mix. The bartenders are very knowledgeable about the beer options available. As they are a brewery, they have many fresh beers. They have a great points program so you earn as you drink. They created the Poe as a unique addition to their Ravens experiences. It's a milk Stout that has red currant added to it. It is discounted during Raven's games.
If football 🏈 isn't your thing, they have Meatless Mondays and Bingo on the 2nd Wednesday. If you're looking for a fun place, The Bell Marker is where you should be.< /text><gmap_id>0x80d954a79cf9f47b:0x42cb29f6988ee85d<//gmap_id>< name>

Nice brewpub opened up in San Diego. Wasn't too pricey for the Drive-thru burger despite the concern of other reviews.

Small but decent selection of brews, most of which are done on site.

Certainly worth it at any time of the day.< /Text>

<text>This was the worst experience ever.   Apparently the servers there don't understand they actually need to pay attention to the customers, instead of setting up tables and completely ignoring.
We were a group of 10, straight from work, at 4:30 p.m, not drunk.  They pulled together tables so we could all sit together and then no one came to take orders until we went up to the bar to let them know. We all ordered drinks.  The girl brought my wine (1/3 of a glass for $11.00!) and no one else.  Then came back with another 1/3 glass of red wine plus a "taste" of red wine in the next glass, explaining they just ran out of wine?  Really?
An hour later, we then had to find someone who would actually pay attention to us to say we were done and just wanted our bill.
They could have made a lot of money on our table had they paid attention. They never even came back to check on us or see if we wanted to order any food (which we did want to).
I know they just changed ownerships, but you better get your act together or you will be closing fast.< /text><pics>None<//pics><resp>None< /resp><GmapID>0x80d954a79cf9f47b:0x42cb29f6988ee85d</GmapID></record>

<review>What a great surprise to find a comfortable brewpub with vegan food options!  The pizza with sausage (made by the same people who make the Impossible burger) was the best vegan pizza I have had, you would never know it was vegan.

The Impossible burger was a nice surprise, it's always a treat to find these at any restaurant.  The beer was great, but you can find that in a lot of places in this county.  What you can't always find is friendly and efficient service.  Our waitress, Paige, was well informed and was able to guide these vegan patrons to the best foods and dessert.

Even if you can't appreciate the delicious vegan fare, this is a great spot to try.</review><name>Harper Perry<//name><Gmap_id>0x80d954a79cf9f47b:0x42cb29f6988ee85d< /Gmap_id></record>

I don't do this often, but this place is great!  The bar is super nice and they have a lot of different liquor options as well as great beer on tap at a reasonable price!  They have a variety of food which is all been amazing, including the vegan and vegetarian options...seriously haven't had anything I didn't Like! All the bartenders and servers are super friendly and recommend things upon request.  The best part is they serve food until 1am!</Text>

<text>Wow, paid 120$ for 90’s hip hop night for New Years as advertized and was laughed at by the Owners son DJ when I asked him why he wasn’t playing the New Years Music as advertised? The bouncers and managers agreed that that he wasn’t playing 90s music as advertised but since he was the owners son they couldn’t do anything. This restaurant is a fraud, disgusting food and customer service, don’t waste your hard earned money here.< /text><GmapID>0x80d954a79cf9f47b:0x42cb29f6988ee85d< /GmapID><userid>111198958797354391765< /userid><Resp>None< /Resp>< Rating>

The Bell Marker is a new restaurant in downtown San Diego on the corner of 6th and Broadway. It offers varieties of vegan and non vegan food. I ordered steamed clams and like it. However, I did not care for the flavor of either flat iron steak or shrimp cocktail. There is nothing special about the two cocktails that I tried. Staff were very nice and friendly.<//Review>

Only thing worse than the salad was the service, or total lack thereof. Ordered a $14 Country salad which was really chicken nuggets surrounded by a ton of lettuce. I found about 3 grapes,a few tiny slivers of avocado and little else. Totally bland rabbit food, helped very little by the thimble of bland Ranch. I was ignored almost completely despite the light crowd at the bar.  I had to yell across the bar to get my tab, which included no tip after her rudeness. Go anywhere but here.<//Text>

I got the brunch menu avocado toast and the peachside pale ale. The beer was pretty good, the avocado toast was pretty sad for $11. The bread was super plain, and it had like five strips of onion on it. Just avocado spread on white bread, with the sad onion and a small dayd of spices. :( I kinda expected a better avocado toast for that much. The waitress was super nice though, with good recommendations for beer!<//review>

We spontainously walked in here just looking for anything to eat. We got a warm welcome and amazing service from our waiter Gordon. Food was great. Vegan pizza, peperoni pizza, shrimp roll and ceasar salad. We got samples of their delicious own crafted beer to help us decide. I REALLY recommend this place!! Also a plus for the great 60/70s music< /Text>

Just another place overselling beer in San Diego using the classic ploy of selling high percent beer and pouring it into an 8oz. glass hence more money for them and less beer for us! We do not need such practice of cunningly devicive business strategies in San Diego, especially when it comes to our beloved craft beer culture! Remember, with great power comes great responsibility. And so, either indicate on the menu (out of courtesy and consideration for your customers, if you care) which beers come in smaller glasses -or, train your staff to accordingly inform the valued customer upon ordering "The Niedermeyer" that this beer being at 9.3% ABV comes in a smaller glass. You have the power to improve and demonstrate further capacity or see how long it takes for your address to give us a real San Diego brewery who knows and cares about San Diego's craft brew culture and our beloved community. Thank you, kindly, for your consideration upon reading this. Respectfully, David R.</Review>

<review>A big thanks to the lady bartender who took care of me today! Her recommendations set the standard for a most delectable and satisfying meal. I was looking for a hearty salad because it's lunchtime and I was withering away to nothingness. She suggested the Beet Salad with red quinoa, mint and dukkah (an African spice) with a side of pita. The pita came out perfect- hot & fresh, just like me. The Beet Salad was a great portion size with exuberant flavor. The Cremant Rosé caught my eye but I didn't try because, somehow, I just don't feel right spending more than $20 for a lunch for 1 person. In total, I spent $18 including tip. Very relaxed, yet attentive service accompanies a simple, appeasing menu.<//review>< rating>

<text>This guy means business. I shattered my phone screen and was completely distraught. In this day and age I was foreseeing weeks before expecting any results. Luckily for me I found this guy on google, set up an appointment, went in the next day, and before I knew it had my screen fixed within 24 hours of shattering it. Very polite, mask above nose, I was in and out in 15 minutes. Highly highly recommend his services.< /text>< Pics>

I asked Joe to just look at my iPhone and then call me on my other phone and give me a cost estimate to fix.  Instead Joe took it upon himself to go through with a repair that I did not authorize and then charge me an above market price for the repair.  2 months later my "repaired" iPhone in which Joe replaced the battery with a "genuine Apple battery" will no longer turn on which strongly indicates that the battery he used to replace it with was not genuine Apple and was a cheap as possible replacement used to maximize his profit.  Other reviews below show evidence that Joe has been snooping through their personal phones and doing malicious things which at this point I would not be surprised to hear as he showed little respect towards me by not listening to my request about the repair originally and also lying about the parts used for replacement.  I also am suspicious as to how many of the below reviews are fakes.< /Review>

I was referred to Joe by the Genius Bar at the Apple Store. I had a problem with my battery, and with the iPhone was out-of-warranty. Joe was able to service it in 10 minutes. Great service! Highly recommended.

Don't hesitate! You could message me if you need some references.

Make sure you set up an appointment beforehand.</Review>

BEWARE of FRAUD! I started getting fraudulent online charges to the card that was linked to my apple pay 2 days after I used his service.

In response to that response: It was not because I paid with apple pay. It is because “Joe” asked for my apple ID and password and right after my apple pay was used fraudulently. Is this just one big coincidence????<//text>

Quick and Genuine phone repair service. Doesn’t sacrifice quality in repair or parts. Screen replacement for iPhone 7 Plus took 23 minutes exact. I recommend going here for repairs. Just place an appointment online if you want that kind of efficient service with time.<//Text>

< review>
We searched this place online and decided to give it a try due to its review.  What a disappointment.
We took our iPhone in because it stoped working. We made an appointment.  They took the phone and told us it will be about 45 min before they can tell us what’s wrong.  They also told us it will be $25 if they couldn’t fix it.  We agreed.  45 min later the guy came out saying they couldn’t fix it and suggested we get a new phone or buy a used phone from them.  We took the phone and left.  As soon as we got in the car, we noticed the phone is different.  Ours had a crack in the screen protector and had no scratches on the side because it was always in a case.  So we texted them saying we will come back because we thought they accidentally switched the phone.  When we went in, the guy said he doesn’t have another iPhone inside and that this is our phone.  I told him about the screen protector and how ours was broken.  He said he changed it because he thought he broke it.  Well why didn’t he tell us that when he gave us the phone back?   Did he not think we will notice or he didn’t want to admit he broke the screen because he thought he broke it.  Also the screen protector he put on the phone, was all scratched.  When we asked why did he say he gave us a new one, he said he never said he put a new one on.  So he was just going to keep the used screen protector on and not even mention it.  He then told us to call T-Mobile and ask them to give us the phone IMEI number.  As if that’s Proof.  Of course it’s going to match because it’s our phone.  We told him we can’t even access the phone at all so how are we going to get the IMEI number.  Then he asked us to get the number from the sim tray. Then he suggested to pull the sim try so I can get the IMEI from it as if that can’t be changed, placed in an old phone and give it to us.  Bottom line is the case of this phone is not ours.  He then texted us a picture of the broken screen indicating it’s part of the service and then he said he didn’t appreciate us accusing him of switching the phone.  We didn’t accuse anyone.  We simply asked if a mistake was made.  There was no need for him to get that defensive which further makes me suspicious of the whole thing.  Never again will I ever set a foot in that place.  Buyer be aware.</review>

Doesn't get any better than this!  Superb quality service, and super fast. Joe has been in the business for many years and knows his stuff. My iPhone 6 home button didn't work, Apple wanted too much money, and the other shop installed a new home button, but it didn't work, said they could not fix, and told me to go back to Apple.  I called Joe, he said come over now, in and out of his office in ten minutes, completely fixed, plus he gave a a new glass screen protector at no charge.<//text>

From A-Z this process was safe and professionally done. If you can make it to Berkeley, you won't regret having Joe handle all your iPhone repairs. Highly recommended. Friendly, punctual, and communicative! 🙏🏼<//review>

< Review>
Thank you!!! Came in about a week ago for a replacement screen on an iPhone 8. Quick easy service and well priced. About a week later the screen went black, it was defective (to NO fault of theirs - just my bad luck). Last thing I needed after a very stressful day. I reached out and Smith was very responsive and friendly. Brought the phone back in and Smith replaced it under warranty (no charge!) and so quick! Thank you so much Smith, your helpful and friendly attitude made my week! 10/10 would return next time my clumsy husband decides to crack his screen!<//Review>

Overall, Joe did a fast and efficient job but I would not do it again and would not recommend him.

I took an iPhone 5s with a cracked screen and he did the job remarkably fast and the replacement screen looks good and seems to work well enough.

The reasons I'm giving a low rating is that the experience left me feeling like something malicious may have been installed on my phone. He used my phone to do a couple of things without my permission. I unlocked it at his request but then he sat facing me with the screen out of my view while he tested it. I noticed he had opened apps on my phone without showing me what they were exactly. He also used my youtube account to subscribe to a couple of channels without asking me. When I asked him about it after the fact he said that it was part of the"testing and checking."

He did all the testing on my old, cracked screen which actually worked fine, I simply wanted to fix the glass so it didn't worsen. Once the new screen was installed he didn't bother to take the plastic cover with the barcode off or see if it worked at all. No "testing and checking" was required for the freshly installed screen, I guess.

Now I'm living with the feeling that something malicious may have been installed or done to my phone. It wasn't worth the savings.< /text>

<Text>Joe is a mega professional and knowledgeable in what he is doing. He is also very quick and precise at work like surgeon.

I initially came to him with the terribly  broken iPhone screen. He fixed it in less than 10 minutes, and even gave a new screen protector.

After that, I noticed that my secondary mic stopped working properly (I could talk on the phone but not record audio). I asked Joe whether it could be related to the recent screen change (e.g., loosely screwed part), and he invited to have a look at it. He discovered that everything was screwed well, but the secondary mic was damaged. Although no one knows when and how it got damaged, Joe changed the component immediately (this time again in <10 minutes). Because it was not clear whether the mic was damaged during the screen change or not, he did not charge me for the mic replacement, as he offers warranty to the work he is doing.

This is a really high level of service and professionalism for a small business. I cannot imagine what kind of bill would I see in Apple Store for that, and also, I'm sure Apple Store would never have returned me a perfectly working phone back in just 10 minutes!

Joe is simply the best!<//Text>< Rating>

I initially used this service to have a failing battery replaced for $50 on a spare iPhone. A good price. After several weeks the battery lost power and the phone would not charge or turn on. Joe offered to look at it and diagnosed a software failure. He reinstalled the software and did not even charge anything. This despite the apparent lack of any fault on his part that led to the problem. I cannot more highly recommend this business!< /Text>

I drove down to Berkley from Sebastopol to unlock my phone and fix the network settings. The price was fair and the service was great, however after arriving home, the phone's service stopped working again. I made another appointment and went back, had it re-done (for no extra charge) and when I arrived home the service had stopped working yet again. I was refunded almost the full amount. It was a frustrating experience because the phone was broken to begin with, but not because of Joe, as his service was pretty great. Would recommend.< /Review>

This was exactly the kind of experience one hopes for when ones phone breaks. Joe was quick, smart, kind, and explained things easily. A further question was dealt with immediately and graciously. His costs were fair and clear.
It made me want to bring everything that was broken to him. He doesn't want my toaster however so I will just go back any time I have phone/computer problems.< /Review>

Dropped my iphone 7+ face down on some hard gravel, picked it up to find the screen was catastrophically smashed into sharp smithereens.  Texted Joe who had repaired a screen for me 7 years ago, and was relieved to find out he’s still available and has moved to a more convenient shared work space at Center and Shattuck and was able to help as soon as I arrived.  If you’re driving a car, just park in the new garage next door, it’s the least painful parking option downtown Berkeley cost same or less than Street meter.  Joe let me and my shepherd dog hang out in the office lounge for the less than 15 minutes it took for him to replace screen and LED unit for a very fair price, w/screen protector. Highly recommended, total pro, very convenient.  Thanks again Joe!</Text>

<Rating>5</Rating><user>103682152403732517911<//user><Review>Joe was really helpful with my cracked phone. It was cracked beyond repair and we brought it to Apple to try to salvage our data since it was not backed up to iCloud. Apple advised they would not be able to fix it due to the body of phone being bent. We suggested temporarily putting on a new screen just so we can get data off to which they referred us to some data recovery “specialists”. Quote was for $700 minimum!? I quickly jumped on yelp and called a few places before I got Joe. He asked a couple questions about the condition of the phone and was able to determine that it should be an easy fix and quoted $60!!

Joe is very knowledgeable fast and honest. Will definitely recommend.</Review></record>

< Review>
I was able to make an immediate appointment for an hour after calling. My phone was cracked, screen inoperable and Joe had planned to put on a temporary screen so I could save my photos. After replacing the screen, Joe determined my phone was locked due to damage from the initial drop and I would not be able to recover my photos. Joe very kindly insisted on waiving his fee though he'd spent 20+ minutes installing a temporary screen.

Friendly, convenient and very professional, I recommend Joe to anyone needing iphone repair.<//Review>

<rating>5<//rating><Review>Joe gets top marks. I brought my daughter’s phone to him when she had cracked the screen about six months back. It recently started acting funny while she was typing. I contacted Joe and he took a look at it, did some research and told me that when the phone upgrade to system 11 happened that made it incompatible with the screen he’d put in. He had already replaced the screen with a compatible one at no charge when he gave me this news. Couldn’t be happier with the outcome or more satisfied with his service.<//Review>< pics>

My phone had been broken the point where I couldn’t tap anywhere and the whole LCD panel was just colored lines. I was expecting to drop my phone off, come back a day later and be charged a lot like most phone repair services but I was totally wrong. He fixed it up in ten minutes while I was there and the price was really cheap. I totally recommend seeing him to fix your phone. Excellent service.</text>

Joe has been working on my phones for years.  He does a great job every time and won't charge you if it's a problem that can't be fixed. He can usually have your phone back to you in the time it takes to drink a coffee -- I highly reccomend him!< /review>

< Review>
I cracked my screen this morning, found Joe online, made an appointment online, took my phone to Joe in a cafe on Shattuck, and 20 minutes later: my screen was fixed. I promise you the screen feels better than it did before it was damaged! Joe did an excellent job, and I didn't have to buy another phone!  I was only charged $70 for my iPhone 4. I will recommend Joe's service to everyone I know who's walking around with a cracked screen. Thanks Joe! PS..I sent him a text message months later about charging issues, and he was willing to squeeze an appointment in for me the same day.  I solved the problem, so that wasn't necessary, but it was nice to know that he's always willing to help! Thanks again!!<//Review>

Joe replaced my iPhone 6 battery for a reasonable price, and in under 10 minutes - cheaper than going to the Apple store and I didn't have to part with my phone for several days! He also answered follow-up questions promptly via email, and investigated a couple of problems afterward at no charge under his 3-month warranty coverage.<//Text>

Best phone repair experience I've had.  Fast & very reasonably priced.  Joe fixed my broken iPhone in 1/2 hour and charged me only $85. This'll be my new go-to for phone repair.<//Review>

<review>Joe is a lifesaver! My phone was ran over by several cars, and I took it to him to see if it was as simple as replacing the screen. After replacing the screen, the LCD was acting strange, so he asked to keep the phone a little while longer and when I came back, he had repaired that as well for no additional charge!

A couple of days later I noticed that the camera wasn't working, so I texted him and got an immediate response, followed by a quick phone call. I brought the phone back, and he tried everything he could but the camera needed replacing.

He warranties he services, which is HUGE. Lots of appointment availability. Quick work, even though he often seems to be juggling a couple customers at a time.

Small piece of advice is that his "office" is in People's Cafe. He sits in the front window wearing a black visor. The appointment site sent that information in a text to a broken phone (which wasn't helpful) and I was confused the first time I went there.

Overall, I would ABSOLUTELY use Joe again (although -finger's crossed- hopefully I won't have to) and would TOTALLY recommend him to family/friends.<//review>< Pictures>

Great guy and professional but I have to admit kind of expensive at $80 for iphone 5.  That's the only negative thing for me.  Only $20 difference from apple which charges $100 for shattered glass for iPhone 6s (bigger screen).  Other than rhat I rwcommend him.< /Review>

< review>
I made an appointment 3 days before coming to this guy and when i came for the service i wanted, he made me wait for 15 minutes for no reason. i wanted to get my iphone jailbroken and he said he can do it. I told him the ios for the phone and he said he can provide me the service if i get an appointment. He sent me off saying he cant do it because he doesnt have a PC computer! How can you say you can do this jailbreak but not have the source??? Makes no sense. If you cant provide the service, why make me get an appointment when i made sure if he can do it for my phone with the specific ios i told him about???? I wasted a whole hour driving from Hayward to Berkeley just for him to say he cant do it, when i made sure ahead and that he can do it. VERY DISSAPOINTED!</review>

Although the chicken bowl was delicious I felt it was a little over priced for just getting chicken and rice and a can of coke I paid $7.61 BUT it was very very tasty. I would recommend this place for sure! They even sell whole pigs if you book 5 days in advance.<//Review>

The food at Tony's is great. Perfectly grilled and paired with tasty rice and other sides. I would suggest that you call to order first, so you won't have to wait too long. usually, the food is ready when i get to the place. :)<//text>

Freshly made2order BBQ. Not under any heated lamp.
Ample parking spaces but crowded during lunch and dinner times.
Friendly counter staff
Small but clean establishment
Limited dining tables
Freshly made bibingka (sweet rice cake)

Don't like waiting, best to call in your order. Even if you plan to dine in.<//Text>

< Review>
Great quality bagels and bagel sandwiches. Perfect for lunch dinner or snack.
The potato bagel is the best!!!
I came in for 2 toasted bagels at 2:30 in the afternoon. The staff seemed like they were done with the day and not helpful. As I was there I saw that was not totally the case. The girl behind the counter gave a man his bagel sandwich and apologized  for the length of his wait. She offered him a muffin of his choice to make up for it. He accepted and was truly thankful for her gesture.
That was nice to witness. My bagels were as requested and delicious. I did not have a long wait.
Thanks<//Review>

During the pandemic, this location of Einstein's Bagels deserves a Gold Star.  The employees deserve an A+ for operating safely and following measures to keep us customers safe.  In fact I say it is the safest eating establishment in San Diego.  They are patient with me when I call after using the app which is not perfect, to adjust my order. Every time I place an order whether for pick-up or curbside, my order is ready within minutes.  Plus they do a great job making bagel sandwiches and my ice coffee. If you are looking for a quick breakfast, coffee or snack in a safe location, this place is the best.<//text>

<Review>I saw this place after work and knew I had to go. Today I wanted to try a new thing out of my usual routine, so I got a French toast bagel with maple spread! I couldn't wait till I got home to try this new bagel (new for me) It was good but then it just becomes too much spread and then its ok. I got my usual chocolate chip bagel with peanut butter just in case this would happen. Still happy with everything and the service at this location.<//Review>< Rating>

I have been here a number of times.  The bagels and food are what you expect from any Einstein.  But the customer service is highly variable.  My sense is that they are poorly managed understaffed or both.  When they lost my order today and it took 25 minutes for one bagel they got defensive instead of just saying sorry.  Other times they are better but if there is any line at all I recommend you head for the door or you will be waiting a long time or worse.< /Review>

Cindy the manager needs to know if you have something wrong with your order. I had three orders not go right, one that was cold so I decided to go back this time and just let her know instead of writing a bad review. She can only fix the problem if she knows. She handles things very professionally, sincerely and kindly! I appreciate the refund and her offer to remake the breakfast. That’s how businesses should run!
Please don’t rip a new on on reviews go to the manager in person and let them know so they can do quality control with their staff.</Text>

Never had Einstein Bros. before today. They did not disappoint. Chris helped me, he was super helpful and friendly. Whole staff seemed very nice and the entire facility seemed very clean. Got the farmhouse bagel for breakfast, 10/10 would recommend. Also probably a good idea to grab some napkins.<//text>

Bagel was hardly toasted. All three coffee dispensers were empty. My wife wanted to enjoy her coffee with her sandwich but that didn’t happen. Once the coffee was done she found that the creamer was out. Three employees working and just an over all bad experience and customer service.< /review>

Best bagels, hands down. Chewy, amazing bread bagels, don't even need to toast it or put schmear on it. If you do bakers dozen with 2 tubs of cream cheese it's about $12 if you pick up before 11am (around $15 if after 11am). Try the honey almond spread on a plain bagel...sweet deliciousness.</text>

Nice bagels with fresh cream cheese. Good pitstop to grab a quick bagel meal. Lots of variety to choose from except they had run out of a lot of options at noon. I really wanted to try the jalapeno cheddar but they'd run out. Ended up with onion and everything bagel which was nice. The staff was also nice and accomodated my request to add mushroom and egg even after order was placed at no cost! Washrooms were clean and required a passcode.</Review>

Not happy with this location. First of all a toasted bagel should be a light brown and crispy not white and doughy. We waited 10 mins for our bagels just 2 and finally found them up on the counter. All the while names are being called out for others to pick up their order. When I asked to have my bagel remade because it was now luke warm the girl told me you must not have heard us call your name. I was sitting right in front of the counter. Wrong answer. Her response should have been "I am sorry let me remake this for you" Great customer service is the success of any business. The staff needs re-training and a toasted bagel means lightly brown, crispy and warm.<//text>

Bought 6 bagels,  they were hard as rocks, called next morning offered to bring them to the manager, she said she would replace them, I went for the replacement and was treated as though I was trying to scam 6 free bagels!  A tall male employee was very rude and loud  saying we make our bagels fresh e ery day, so what was wrong with them?   I  explained  to  him the details and he got louder and louder saying that I was should know, I  said I  don't know how to make bsgels but something was wrong.  I'm  disabled and jt is hard to get around.  The man continued to insult me and finally said if you want the bagels  I  will let you have them , I  said keep your bagels and I  left.  After the manager called and said she didn't think his intentions were bad she said come in  and I will give you some free items....like I will ever go back!  I didn't do anything wrong.  I have a small fortune in the bank  I don't steal, lie, or cheat.  I  may sue that employee or Einstein Brothers.   I have been going to that location since they opened, until recently due to a series of serious surgeries and life changing events.  Zero stars if possible!<//Text>

<review>One of the workers accidentally grabbed a blueberry muffin instead of a chocolate chip muffin and handed it to me. When I saw it was the wrong order she gave me the right order and only charges me for one. They also had made an extra coffee and with no charge walked outside and gave it to my grandma. Amazing service!<//review><pics>None</pics><Resp>None</Resp>< gmapID>

I used to work at that location between 2003 and 2004. And even though the food back then was delicious, the employees were rude, ghetto and very gossipy, even the store manager was a rude a selfish prick. I was fired by the store manager at that time because I couldn't work on Labor Day. I gave him a 3-week notice about it because my babysitter couldn't work that day, but he still fired me. And he was so chicken he wasn't there to terminate me, instead a store supervisor gave me the papers. So unprofessional!

If you want to eat at a restaurant without all the ghetto and rude employees, DON'T EAT THERE. If you're planning on getting a job there and you don't do any of the above, DON'T APPLY THERE. But if you like or do all that stuff...then by all means, enjoy.</Review>

We had a birthday gathering over the weekend. The pasta dishes were very tasty!  The rice plates and appetizers we ordered were good as well. Service was excellent.  My mom and my brother are picky eaters,  but they both gave thumbs up for this place, hey, that meant something.   We definitely will be back again!<//review>

I went in late not knowing what kinda place this was. Pictures made it look good. Food was an interesting blend between American and Asian food.  Very very good. The prices were also very reasonable.  So many drink choices and the chick's dig the little art work on them. I will come back here if given  the chance and I live 2 hours away.< /Text>

We would come back and we recommend the chili cheese fries. The pork belly bao tacos were yummy too. The only thing I didn't care for was the ramen kimchi burger. The ramen buns were just a little too gummy for me.< /review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNweTBJekT216URkwqug41HxWAsqMAlQKOjyEsc=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNzRGQw4DIiB9WHPLlX7mVTd8NeLQEL3ZntT8XE=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMG6Lcb5XmEvT0TiNbfuNdxJBVPSnbx4X9_UvwR=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMnoD8tf56cj3wyZzSY17V6vI4muZVbnd0YbF7-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures>< Response>

Service is good and attentive even if u sit in the patio. The servers come out often to make sure you don't need anything. I like their hot teas and they are refillable. Popcorn chicken and spam masubi are not bad either.  Nice place to hangout with friends.</review>

I just had a horrible experience with them. I placed an online order and had them call me 3 times before I finally realized it. They called me to tell me they didn't have what I have ordered available. Then she gave me another option, I agreed. 2 minutes later I get ANOTHER call stating they don't have that plate either I need to choose again. At this point I had her cancel my order. NEVER BUYING FROM HERE AGAIN!< /Review>

<review>Ambiance: Very, very nice. The look of the exterior of the building is already really nice, and when I first glanced at it, I thought of a high-end steakhouse or something. The interior is very modern and hip - quite like a lot of other places that seem to attract teenagers and people in their 20's. Brick walls, nice tables and chairs, candles on the shelf, nicely lit sign, outdoor patio seating, high chair seating ... I can tell that a lot of thought and money went into designing this place.

Food: I came here during their soft opening, so I'm not sure if the dishes are set in stone or subject to changing. The ramen burger looked really enticing (and pricey), but my boyfriend and I decided to just order the spam musubi. The order was $4.25 for two pieces - so pretty much around $2.00 for each. I think it was a little pricey for what I ate because while I liked the flavor of the rice and spam and the seaweed (especially what was sprinkled on the sides of the musubi), the flavor wasn't that great.

Drinks: I really wanted to order a popular drink, so I chose the potted plant milk tea with boba. My boyfriend ordered an iced green tea sea salt latte. Apparently in Chinese, the drink description said it came with a layer of milk cream at the top, which I would not have known since I don't read Chinese. We wanted to compare it to Tbay's milk cream tea - I personally thought the latte was too salty. There was a lot of sea salt that made the cream not as tasty as I would have liked, and there wasn't enough green tea flavor. For my potted plant milk tea - I actually had tried it before when my sister brought it home from Macchiato. She said it was too sweet, and I definitely agree after drinking it for myself at The Bleu House. The cream and oreo cookie crumble at the top - very sweet by itself, but it tasted better when mixed with the tea. However, it was still too sweet, and I usually don't mind sweet! The boba was cooked very well ... I really liked the texture and chewiness of the boba.

Macarons: The Bleu House's redeeming feature for me was the selection and price of the macarons. It was $1.75 each or 6 for $9.50 - great price! And the macarons are definitely quality macarons. I would say they are my third favorite coming in behind Bottega and Lette. Good flavor, great texture, wonderful flavor! I tried the rose, royal, salted caramel, vanilla, red velvet, and almond. My least favorite was the almond (haven't found one that can rival Lette's yet!), but I liked the rest a lot. Royal tasted like a royal milk tea, and the red velvet wasn't too sweet. The rose and salted caramel were my favorites - loved the texture in the middle and the shell. And they came in a little cute box! I'm glad to know they have these at Macchiato, too so I don't have to drive too far to get some when I have a craving!

Service: For the soft opening, there was a 10% discount if you checked into Yelp. They didn't advertise this, so I had to ask them if this discount was still valid. The workers are all very nice, but they seem a little confused and nervous, which is understandable. We had asked them a few questions upon ordering and upon receiving the check, and the answers they gave us didn't answer the question we had asked at all.

tl;dr - Overall, I would say this would be a nice place to sit with a friend and catch up. The small plates and entrees seem very intriguing and the prices can be justifiable depending on what you order. I probably will avoid the potted plant and just order a more common drink (or the icy)! And definitely try the macarons!<//review>< name>

Not a bad place, just not into these kind of cafe. The chipotle chicken tenders were misleading, they just taste like chicken tenders with sweet sour sauce thrown on it.< /text>

The self-service printing station is old and janky, and will inexplicably print your documents incorrectly. However, the staff are upbeat, helpful and proactive about refunding printing issues and finding solutions.</Review>

<text>I simply wanted passport photos to be printed, which I had done before at a different Staples location (very quickly and flawlessly, I might add). However, here it took me 10 minutes to be acknowledged at all, and once I stated that I wanted passport photos printed they told me, "We can't do that here," with no explanation why, despite me asking. I asked if they could just print it out on regular photo paper. They said they only had 8.5 x 11, which was fine by me; I could cut out the photos as long as they were sized properly. The answer was still no.
Finally, the peeved woman in charge of the printing department said that she could do it, but only 1 copy instead of 3 and I would have to wait 45 minutes. (So you can print 1 copy, but not 3? Can you not just print the same file 3 times?)
I said a polite thank you, and marched down the plaza to get my photos printed by CVS, where the service was friendly, efficient, and cheap. I'm not sure why anyone would patronize this Staples if a simple print job like this befuddles their printing department.< /text>< Pics>

Staff was extremely helpful and the color glossy posters turned out perfectly fine! Will definitely come back for printing, but also for craft supplies -- I found in the store a beautiful red Staples Tri project board, just what I needed!<//Review>< pics>

Horrible. I placed an order to pick up business cards on the same day and this location was not able to execute on this. They did not take any fault on this and was unable to provide me with any contact information for there manager!!! When you advertise on your website same day pick up- than you need to follow through! Otherwise, I would not have used your service and gone to FedEx !!!</Text>

I wish I’d never gone to the GEVC presentation.  The high-pressured sales tactics made me extremely uncomfortable.  When I kept saying “No thank you, I’m not interested “over and over again, they just pushed harder and harder.  Eventually, they showed me some vacation options that looked great at a reasonable price.  They showed me a brochure with wonderful hotels and locations with very few restrictions.  I believed everything they told me and bought the package.  But Buyer Beware with this group.  After I purchased the package and tried to book the vacation, the locations they showed me were not in my group…a bait and switch.  The few resorts that were good were never available (and I was able to travel anytime for several months out, but it still didn’t help).  Do yourself a favor and don’t buy anything from GEVC.  You won’t get what you paid for and they promise, promise, promise but don’t deliver.< /text>

All they cared about was trying to force me into buying something that I didn’t even understand.   As soon I stared asking questions, they seemed to get annoyed and would bring other staff people to intimidate me.  I really wanted to learn how the system worked, but they just got upset. The person who was the supervisor seemed nice at first, but became just plain combative.  I wouldn’t recommend attending their presentation unless you want to be badgered and made to feel badly by their aggressive sales techniques.  What a terrible experience.< /Review><pics>None< /pics><Response>None</Response>< gmapID>

<Rating>5</Rating><Review>I have had my vacation club membership with Global Exchange for over 6 years. I love it!  I have gone to other timeshare tours and none have offered me a package that was convenient for me and my family. They have by far given me the best deal. I have been enjoying more vacation time than I ever did as a kid. I'm so happy I said yes. I hope they keep giving families great deals. Thank you!< /Review>< pictures>

Free cruise still costs $398 and they made us drive to San Antonio when they have a local office in Houston to pick up our voucher.  Don’t waste any more time or money dealing with them worst than Enron and the Koch brothers combined with these types of tactics

Go ahead and google the company CasablancaExpress, the company you have to deal with to get your stay...</review>

Today, I went in with an open mind regarding a free gift supposedly I won. When I went in I spoke to Jon who provided very important information regarding vacations for the family. As he continued he was very professional, friendly, outgoing and showed empathy on how wonderful it would be to have an affordable vacation. I personally had my guard up the whole time as he shared his knowledge I was really impressed about what the company has to offer for a lifetime which never expires. My husband and I went in for the presentation and Mike went straight to the point and how we could save thousands in resorts. In the end I knew this was a great investment for my family since I was already planning dream vacations for the upcoming years. I’m very excited. we became members and look forward to  savings to come in 2020. There is a catch to this you will pay member fees but it’s totally worth it. For our family!  Since we became members we got one free vacation to Cancun with air fare and hotel , one weekend getaway our choice any where I’m using that one for Vegas and 4 water park passes with a hotel stay.  #vacations are better than Staycations (per Mike) @GEVC<//Review>

Scott and Woody spent a lot of time with us answering all our questions whenever we needed them. This is a big purchase and they work hard to put any of your worries to rest. We never felt pressured during our experience with GEVC. Their customer service on the phone was also very polite. I had no negative experiences with this company as a whole. Just take your time. Read the contract and ask as many questions as you can. You have 7 days to make up your mind before you are locked in. Ask to try the system with one of their accounts since you cannot try your own until up to 45 days after you purchase which is obviously beyond the 7 day window to change your mind.<//review>

Had a good, informative presentation. They tell you how your money will be used, how much the annual maintenance fee is, and how much the membership costs. Its actually very reasonable. Robbie was super friendly and answered every question. Unfortunately, we were not able to buy the day of our presentation, so we will definitely have to buy on a later date. We got our $40 refund back. Its a great plan for vacationing in the future as hotels only get more expensive. Only downside was that a payment plan is only offered if you purchase the day of the presentation, not if membership is purchased on a later date.<//Text>

<Rating>1</Rating><Text>I regret this purchase immensely. Haven't used it yet even though I've tried. DO NOT BUY! You are better off doing airbnb or vrbo. Wish I had known this. It is hard to find availability where we want to go and rarely are the vacations the low price of $239. It is almost impossible to sell them for the amount you originally paid.<//Text><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

<review>The gifts they offer are a scam. They get you to come to their presentation by offering airline tickets or theme park tickets as a gift. The gifts are fake. They offer a voucher which you have to put a deposit on then you mail the voucher for a confirmation which takes months. Then you you get your confirmation and then you have to mail that back and wait more months. Then after YOU PAY you get your “free” tickets. The people here are very rude. They want your money for time shares. You don’t get any free gifts. You’re basically getting a coupon as a gift. Do not fall for the same Scheme I did. I attended their seminar at 333 South Anita Dr. in Orange CA. Do not go here. You’re better off shopping for vacations online.< /review><Time>1530331071294< /Time><name>Andrew Donahoe<//name>< gmap_id>

Total Rip off possible scam! Customers service is unaccountable for anything and condescending. Don't expect support or assistance with vacation issues. Just purchase RCI membership if you want points. The ownership is pointless and a waste of money. Don't do it  you'll just be paying a monthly note and annual Maintenance fee for Dirty accommodations. Total disappointment on my first booking after two years of accumulating Points to have enough to use towards a vacation.< /Review>

<review>Alicia Rivas in customer service is a gem!! When i called in I was disappointed to say the least but she solved my issue. Honestly I wasn’t sure if there was anything I could do since it was my mistake by not reading the material they gave me. I did have to talk to two people before I got her on the phone. every company has issue but it's the ones like this with good customer service that are gonna last. Thank you Alicia<//review>< Pictures>

"Won" a 3 day/2 night vacation getaway at Santa Monica Pier while boyfriend and I were on vacation. They had us fill out a form with our information then told us to call number a week from date. Mind you, they chit chatted with us, so they knew we were visiting from Virginia. We get home and call the hotline to book our vacation. Thought presentation would be held sometime during the vacation. No, its in their offices in SoCal within 2 weeks of signing up. Obviously we couldn't go thus making us not eligible. Representatives should have told us that but they were probably just trying to get our information to sell to telemarketers. A couple of days after signing up robo calls from California started blowing up celll. SCAM! SCAM! SCAM!< /text>

We came across GEVC inside six flags in San Antonio, Tx. We got lured in by the FREE trip that we "won". We had to give a $40 refundable down payment up front which we would get back after going to the 90 minutes presentation with our FREE trip voucher. As of now we have not purchased the timeshare from the presentation even tho it seemed very appealing and the sales associates there seemed to be very understanding and no pressure whatsoever. We got back our $40 in a form of a prepaid master card that we were unable to use when we left the presentation and went to eat. However, my husband was able to use it to pump gas for our trip back home. We are a bit worried about the FREE trip since we do have to send in money via money order, personal check or cashiers check and from reading other comments we are still debating but as for the presentation and getting our $40 back we are content with that for now.</review>

<Text>It's been a while since I've been here and I was surprised at how much things have changed.  The product selection is much more varied and they have great prices in many brand name items now.  The store is much easier to navigate through.  The employees are friendly and helpful.<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

Way cheaper elsewhere. No tax is irrelevant to the price point they sell their products.  NEX should be cutting their prices big time if the prices is way cheaper elsewhere.< /Text>

I like the NEX but sometimes their prices are higher than on the outside... i dont like having to do price matching every time I want to make a purchase. They really need to pay more attention to the cost of these items outside the gate.<//Text>

Beautiful and historic old buildings. A great place for an event and to learn about the past. If you love local history and need a quick get away, this is a good place.</review>

Aside from that, Heritage Museum of Orange County is simply aesthetically pleasing. From the building itself, to the pieces they showcase, I fell in love. Even their elevator makes you feel like you're entering a new dimension. I haven't seen a lot of work similar to what's at Heritage Museum of Orange County, so I'm definitely glad I got to check this place out.< /text>

I always like going to the California Academy of Sciences because you can see a wide array of nature and animals that make you go back to appreciating the wonders that the city doesn't really offer and the staffs are friendly. You can tell that the staffs have a deep understanding of things and are really passionate in what they do. Also, they have the new Expedition Reef show in their planetarium, which is as real as it can get. Keep up the good work! The only complaint I have about this place is how some tourists come here not with the intention to appreciate science but for wrong intentions.</Text>

Kids love coming here. A little pricey but makes a day go by quick. It's better then the aquarium in La Mirada.< /review>

<Text>Such awesome staff here! I would have never known about this place, but bees made us cross paths and the guys and gals we met, miss Jamie, Jessica and Daniel were soooooo full of zest and pep! I wouldn't come just to hang out with these chipper folk! They also get extra brownie points for making sure the bees got saved from their facility!<//Text>< pics>

Very cool field trip I went on with my daughter's 1st grade class. Always good to learn & be reminded how life was in history, & the accomplishments that others achieved in their lives. How Mr. Kellogg came about to design his home around his love for ships, and how he designed the city of Corona....  very interesting.< /Text>

The venue is worth checking out if you’re looking for an outdoor, rustic venue wedding. There is an area for ceremony, cocktail hour and reception. The reception area is kind of small, but you have a large yard where I’m sure your guests will want to venture out to. Parking was pretty easy. Dj setup wasn’t too difficult except I had to run a long extension cord to my setup location. The venue can probably have some nicer landscaping. But it’s still pretty nice.</text></record>

<review>We went tonight to the haunted tour. While we had a great time in the outside area and the guides there were wonderful, we were very upset about the last portion of the tour. We were told we would be able to spend 20 mins in the Kellogg house, explore and take pictures. We were rushed by Joey, our nephew was told he couldn't take a picture in a room until the guide gave the ok, and it upset him so much he refused to take any more pictures. We were told to hurry up and leave, and when we got outside we learned we could have more time in the house because we were early. Just a bad end to the entire experience. There were 3 adults the guide could have talked to instead of reprimanding a child to the point they were no longer having fun. All in all we left with a negative experience.< /review><resp>{'time': 1602204480609, 'text': "Oh no! We are so sorry to hear this! :( This definitely is not the experience we aimed to provide- we'd be happy to have you back and host a private extended tour of the Kellogg House so you can have the experience you paid for! :) Please email Executive Director Jamie Hiber at jhiber@heritagemuseumoc.org.

<Review>This is a great place for kids to learn about life in late 1800s/early 1900s. They get hands on experience on how people lived without electronics or any automated systems that we're all so used to today. However, the experience is only as good as the tour guide and unfortunately our guide didn't really know how to tailor his presentation to his audience (today it was 7 year old kids). He didn't associate automated modern living to the manual labor of the past. It was still well worth touring.<//Review>< Name>

There is a sign telling you where to park but it’s really small unless you park at the high school which is then a long walk. There is a bus entrance which I recommend you park there. No wifi.</Review>< pics>

<review>If you are looking for an outdoor rustic wedding, well you have found your place! This place is perfect in every aspect of the word! After months of looking for the perfect venue my coworker told me about this place and I fell in love at first sight. Its beautiful during the day and even more during the night. The staff is super friendly and Jamie is just wonderful! She responded to my emails quickly and made sure everything was taken care of. I couldn't have picked a better place. There's plenty of parking and lots of space for guests to walk around and enjoy themselves.<//review>< Rating>

This place is amazing. it boasts natural beauty and well as architectural beauty.  The staff is more than helpful. Jaime is fantastic and probably the nicest person I've met.  Diana with Country Garden Caterers, their required caterer, knows her way around the venue and as our day of coordinator.

Went for a charity event. Great location, ample parking and lots of outdoor area. The historical pictures and notations were great to read and learn about this great place in the heart of Santa Ana.<//review>

<text>Fortunately this house is on the corner in a warehouse district so it is easy to find. A great look back into history and civil engineering. Orange county seems to only celebrates the new and expensive. This is the push-back. I imagine during the school u=year the place is packed. Great tour guides, too.</text></record></dataset><record>

This house is filled with items from the 1800's. The things were not original, but were interesting none-the-less. There were rooms downstairs and upstairs. There was no rail to hold on to so I did not go upstairs. I was able to walk around and take closer looks at the rooms and historic items, The 2nd guide answered many of my questions and explained additional things. They were very helpful when my sister did not feel well. Most local people do not know about this treasure and should. The grounds are lovely, too.</review>

<Text>The grounds here are impeccable. I visited for the Western Steam festival as a vendor so I couldn't wander too much but the museum staff came out and looked at everyone's items ave chatted with us, which I thought was very nice of them. I love how much care goes into the grounds here< /Text>< Pictures>

Super cool place. Original house is a treat to visit. They have antique furniture and stories about how it was used. On the grounds there is a local blacksmith workshop. The venue can be rented out for private events. There is a orchard of Oranges and pergolas with vines makes a beautiful view.<//Review>

<Review>This is a real gem in santa ana, Jamie Hiber director of social enterprise has alot on her plate by making sure all the events not only go smoothly , but that they go above and beyond any expectations . She ,her vendors, and her staff, are all amazing people that make sure all details relating to her customers wishes are done with a warm,welcoming and thoughtful behavior. A big shoutout to her caterer Diana who has the same work ethic as Jamie,,with an eye for detail and food that is unbelievable. Many times, they both work 6 days a week to make sure they provide a wonderful experience at the Heritage Museum and a fabulous memory for life. I have always said you can tell the people who have a passion for what they do, and Jamie Hiber is no exception.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

Very nice little tour.  Too bad you can't go in the farm house though, lot more to explore it seems than just the Kellogg house, but we were limited on time.  Little pricy for what you get.<//review>

Jamie is soo friendly and helpful. They always went above and beyond to make sure our wedding day ran smoothly. The venue is beautiful, our guest and we enjoyed the jasmine and orange blossom scents from the jasmine and orange grove. The rose garden was a great place for our cocktail hour.

<review>I've only been here for an event, and not to visit the museum itself.  It is very large though, and has a few different areas, including an old west area in the back.  Hopefully I can return and see more of the location in the future.</review>< pictures>

(Translated by Google) Visit the garden and Kellogg's house.
The orange tree is beautiful! Kellogg's house usually seems to be charged. (adults $ 7, seniors $ 5, children age 3 to 12 $ 5, children under 3 free * museum day is free) The beautiful and nostalgic interior of the mansion is worth a visit. ^^

It seems to be popular as a wedding venue, but it has a convincing atmosphere. Spring-I think the best time to see the greenery in early summer is the best. ^^

(Original)
お庭とケロッグ邸を見学。
オレンジの木が綺麗！ ケロッグ邸は普段は有料のようです。(adults $7, seniors $5, children age 3 to 12 $5, children under 3 free ※museum day は free) 美しく懐かしい邸宅内部は一見の価値あり。^^

結婚式会場として人気があるそうですが、納得の雰囲気。春-初夏の緑が綺麗な時期は最高だと思います。^^<//text>

<name>Veronika Salatova< /name><Review>(Translated by Google) A very nice museum that introduces visitors to the story of a family who lived in California 125 years ago.
Daily family life, farming, raising children.
The delicious smell of blooming jasmine and a whole orange garden!
The cost of admission to the house museum is $ 7.
On the territory you can walk and get acquainted with the exhibits for free.

(Original)
Очень симпатичный музей, знакомит посетителей с историей одной семьи, проживавшей в Калифорнии 125 лет назад.
Ежедневный быт семьи, ведение сельского хозяйства, воспитание детей.
Восхитительный запах цветущего жасмина и целый апельсиновый сад!
Стоимость входного билета в дом-музей 7 долларов.
По территории можно гулять и знакомиться с экспонатами бесплатно.<//Review>< gmap_id>

Love Jenny and Monkey. Always do their best. Been coming for decades. Jenny will take on all my creative possibilities and is awesome. This week is Elvis Week, so I asked Jenny if she could copy my design. She did, as usual!< /Text>

So today was my first time coming to the nail salon. I have to say that it was AMAZING. Jenny really knows what she is doing. I LOVE this nail salon. I highly recommend it. She did the exact design I wanted. She  took her time on my nails and was super precise. My only regret is not coming here sooner.<//Review>

<text>I’ve been coming to Jenny’s Nail Salon for sometime now and I’ve never been  disappointed !   She is polite caring and to the point , Which I appreciate. When you make an appointment she is prompt  and she expects the same .
You can tell her what you don’t like or what you like,  and she will do her best to make you happy!
Her close friend and coworker monkey is as nice as Jenny !
*But what I really like is that she does my fill seamlessly and they look smooth and even.
Nice natural nail bed slope Is a must and she can deliver !
She not a rush nail artist , which I like!</text><pictures>None</pictures></record></dataset><record>

Jenny nails is the only place I'll ever go to have my nails, toes and facial done. Jenny and Mi ( monkey) are the two most loving kind friendliest people you'll ever want to meet. I've been going there for 9 yrs and where they are I'll be looking great. Jenny always comes up with a different new design for my nails just for me whenever I see her my nails last 6-8 weeks before having them done. Love you guys💓💓💓</Review>

They are so good to me and my sons every time I go. I have read some of the other reviews on here that are negative, and are simply not true. Jenny is in no way shape or form a racist!
She has had people get services done and take off, and not pay her. That is why, if she does not know you, she will have you pay first. No matter what color you are.  I don't blame her! Also, her term of endearment for her friends is "monkey" it has nothing to do with a racist statement! Jenny has some health issues going on, and can not accommodate for all of her walk ins, so, out of courtesy and respect;  and to maintain her excellent nail care, you need to make an appointment. It's common sense and common courtesy to do so. I tell all my friends and co workers to get their nails done there after they compliment me, and ask me "where do you get your nails done?" She does quality work for a very reasonable price!<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

<rate>2< /rate><review>Jenny is nice and her place is close by  but Jenny has her "favorites" and her "best friends" that take precedence over anyone when an average customer such as myself is in the chair. I SPECIFICALLY asked MORE THAN ONCE for diamonds on my nails. Mind you I had an 11:30 apt that I was prompt for, but Jenny's pedicure took longer and I waited an extra 15 min. I soon realized that because my apt was late, the next apt was also going to be late ( Jenny's best friend) walked in and I was rushed out there coincidentally Jenny "Forgot" about my diamonds! Jenny plays favorites and I didn't appreciate that. Not sure if I will be back.<//review><pics>None< /pics><resp>None</resp>< gmap_id>

Nice clean environment and service was ok. My eyebrows were flawless and my eyelashes looked natural but my nails were average. Also I'm not sure if Jenny was racists or not but I was the only black person and the only one who had to pay before my services... that kind of made me wonder and I'm still not sure about going back. Not only that but they made me uncomfortable about bringing my baby suggesting I get a babysitter when that's not their place I am a single mom and I dont have help but that doesn't mean I should be able to make time for self care and that offended me.</text>

I've been going to Jenny's nails for the last 2 years. And about 6 months ago she stated that she wanted to change the name of her shop to monkeys as in black monkeys I took to the media to complain  About her. She has a large African American following and is very important that everyone knows how she really does feel about African American people. However I did go to her a few times after that because she had been doing my nails for so many years. Here as of late she wants me to make an appointment when I come in , I received a phone call from a family member stating that Jenny has been talking very badd about me to my daughter. It really upset my daughter that she has been talking about me like that period she displayed very badd on professional skills when doing so. I just want everyone out there to know that she is not what she seems to be. I will never go back to jenny's nails ever.< /text>

We have been here a few times and have found the BBQ to be adequate. The ribs are flavorful but always seem to be a bit dry. The bbq sauce helps. The bbq meats are good.

The interior is decorated in San Jose historical pictures, old west and country. It is almost always clean and tidy.</Review>

Quite enjoyed this place.  Pulled pork sandwich was moderately peppery, which I like but my kid didn't.  Ribs come uncut, which is kinda cool.  Hush puppies are nice and crispy.  Mac salad and coleslaw were both good.< /Text>

<Review>Great place for bbq - super friendly staff. The beef ribs were delicious , the beef brisket was good but I prefer them with a little more fat. The coleslaw is really good. Would love to come back for prime rib special next time.</Review><Date>1560118897960</Date>< Gmap_id>

<Review>Our go to BBQ place, excellent food in a rustic restaurant.  Been coming since the early 2000 and haven't found anywhere better yet.  Ribs are the best, brisket is great, and the garlic bread is amazing.< /Review>< Pictures>

<Review>I'd give 3.75 stars.
Portions are good. This is the sampler of 3 choices of meat (baby back, beef ribs & chicken). The garlic bread was flavorful with a good crisp. Sides of macaroni & chili were average but good.
Backdrop - I am particular with BBQ. Good BBQ in my opinion is in the seasoning dry rub. The sauce is a "bonus/perk" to add more flavor but shouldn't rely on it to taste good.
Overall - BBQ was smoked good (not burnt) but lacking in flavor. It seemed salt was the biggest flavor I tasted versus seasoning. Lastly, niether ribs do not fall off the bone.< /Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM4Qfd4DybRRoUfmFYlBWDTjHU6KAp4aGhaXONm=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics><response>None< /response>< GmapID>

<text>Got Brisket, Beef Ribs, Chicken. The meat was chewy and overcooked. I think the issue is how they heat up the food before packing for service.
Appetizers were ok, typical fried stuff.

Two stars instead of one - for the nice ladies working there, and being open at these times when we want different types of food.</text></record></dataset><record>

<Review>I really love the decor of the place. There were many meat selections. Portion is generous. I got the brisket and sampler of beef ribs, baby back ribs, and pulled pork. The brisket was half moist and half dry. The ribs were juicy but the meat didn't fall off the bones. The pull pork was okay. Overall the meats were okay. It needed the restaurant BBQ sauce to help it taste delicious; otherwise it is a little bland. The sides were okay. The potato and macaroni salads has too much dressing. The chili was nice. $$$ place.</Review>< Pictures>

This was the best BBQ that I have had since I have been working in this area.  I am from East Texas where BBQ is a huge part of our culture.  This place has the best brisket that I have had while working  on the west coast.</review>

Food is good, but they have a 3.75% "surcharge" for all credit card payments. Prices advertised is the "cash price", which is 3.75% lower. It's illegal in CA to have a surcharge for credit cards. It's OK to give a cash discount, but they need to advertise the full credit card price.

Also, I don't mind it if is like 1%, but 3.75% is a bit much, considering they already raised their food prices recently. Plenty of other BBQ joints in the area that don't do these shady business practices.<//Text>

Service is very good and food is very tasty. We had the ribs, brisket and hot links plates and all were very good. Ribs were cooked right and flavorful without needing bbq sauces. Brisket was tender and not dry, and hot links were not too hot and has nice consistency. Price is comparable to other bbq restaurants in San Jose area. For these 2 plates; each with garlic bread and 2 sides (no drinks), it was about $45 total. If I have to nitpick, the garlic bread didn’t have “just out of the oven” taste... not sure if we’re there later in the evening and that’s why. Overall, very good and will come back again.</Text><rate>5<//rate>< Time>

Sam’s bbq is my top pick for bbq restaurants in the San Jose area. Service is very good and food is very tasty. We had the ribs, brisket and hot links plates and all were very good. Ribs were cooked right and flavorful without needing bbq sauces. Brisket was tender and not dry, and hot links were not too hot and has nice consistency. Price is comparable to other bbq restaurants in San Jose area. For these 2 plates; each with garlic bread and 2 sides (no drinks), it was about $45 total. If I have to nitpick, the garlic bread didn’t have “just out of the oven” taste... not sure if we’re there later in the evening and that’s why. Overall, very good and will come back again.<//Text>

I read really great reviews of this place, unfortunately that was not my experience. I picked up my full slab of baby back ribs eagerly anticipating the goodness that is pork ribs. I was very disappointed. The ribs were extremely dry and hard liketlike had been sitting all day, they were also over salted. They were slathered in sauce which is not surprising, I think they were trying to cover up the fact that they were so dry. There was no flavor except salt. I will not be returning there.<//Text>

It may not be the greatest BBQ I've ever had but the food is still good and the staff and environment are welcoming. Nice covered outdoor patio with the appropriate Covid layout. Sufficient free parking.< /Review>

<Review>Barbecue place it's not as well as it was 10-15 years ago I ordered ribs it was so hard the barbecue sauce area the best part of the whole BBQ was the garlic bread sorry to say the potato salad isn't as good as it used to be and neither are the beans.
I definitely will not be eating there anymore sorry to say my husband and I are trying different BBQs in our area so far Dickey's BBQ is way better than Sam's sorry to say our next one will be trying would be Winchester's South Winchester BBQ<//Review>< pictures>

One of the few places I know of that serves beef ribs. Unfortunately, mine had more fat than meat. Probably won't order those again. Great smokey flavor though! Pulled pork sandwiches were very good. Garlic bread would have been perfect if it hadn't been cold. Fries were good, but wasn't a fan of the chili.  Service was OK, but I have a feeling we weren't seeing them at their best that night. Willing to try them again.<//review>

I had the brisket plater, the brisket was extremely dry and tough. My sides were the macaroni salad which was good not great and potato salad, which was bland and disappointing as well. The garlic bread was good. The meal cost 25$ after tax and I believe was unreasonably over priced especially for the quality of the dish. I won't be back unfortunately. I had eaten here years ago the ribs and it was good however still say over priced. If looking for bbq, there is a wonderful place also close by. A brislet platter with juicy meat, delicious red potato salad coleslaw and homestyle cornbread with butter and honey for only $16 with tax is at Winchester BBQ on Winchester Blvd. About 5 to 10 minutes away. I highly recommend that restaurant I recently have gone to twice and received the same impressive quality both visits.</text>

Well, it is!!
They actually have been around for sometime, and they are keeping their customers happy. It can get crowded, but they keep up the pace for dining in and dining out.

If you plan to eat and listen to some live music, look at the schedule ahead on the their website., and call to see if you need to reserve a spot. It works out better that way.

The ribs never disappoint.
Get yourself a bottle of their own BBQ sauce.
They have a variety of different dishes. But even if you want a salad or a hotdog, it’s ready to be ordered.

If you want to know where the San Jose Police are, you’ll find them here. No pig jokes. (••)< /Review><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< GmapID>

<rate>4<//rate><Review>Went for weekday lunch.  Beyond ribs, Sam's offers a great variety of BBQ...  I got the BBQ pork shoulder, mac and cheese, and chili.  The pork shoulder did not have much sauce but they provide sauce "on the side" so you can decide how saucy you want your BBQ.  A friend who ordered ribs mentioned the same.  With garlic bread one does NOT leave hungry when you order a platter.  I enjoyed it all and will return!  I'm craving it as I write this review.  Ha!</Review>< Pics>

<text>I have been wanting to review this place for a long time but being partially a vegetarian, I thought it would be wrong to judge this place based off what I have eaten/tried so far. So I decided to put down a review based on what my husband thinks of this place. To be more accurate, we took my brother to this place to get a validation for my husband's choice!

OK Soo..If my husband had his way, this is where we would be eating every day of the week!! He loves loves loves this place (trust me, those are way less loves than his appreciation of this place).

Ambience and Staff:
The place is cosy and nice, the cutest part is that there is a toy train constantly running along the sides of the roof (Choo Choo!!)
The staff is friendly. Everytime we have visited, there was not much of a line and getting seated is pretty easy too. The restaurant has an outdoor as well an indoor seating, so you can pick what's your comfort zone.

Ordering:
Placing an order is pretty easy too, you go to the counter and get your bill. The cashier will give you your order number, you take that and pick a seat for yourself. They bring your order to the table.

Food:
For their vegetarian burger, I would give them a 2/5, the veggie patty was tasteless, there were no sauce inside the burger and it felt really dry. I got the burger with side of macaroni which was great!

Brisket: 10/10 My brother and husband both got the brisket and they would not let me rate it any less than 10/10. The meat was great, cooked well, the portion was great and the sides were amazing too. This is probably the most popular dish as most of the tables within my vision.

Needless to say, I will definitely go again and maybe this time around I can give their chicken a try!<//text>< username>

Good service, staff was friendly and food was served quickly.  Hot links, beef brisket, chilli beans, and garlic bread were hella good.  Chicken and Pork ribs were dry maybe it was an off day. I'd go back!!< /Text>

Old fashioned bbq joint. It's not Carolina style but the fresh brewed tea is close. I recommend the hot links, beef or pork ribs and the chili (two types on with beans) sides are small but the main attraction is the meat. There's a board with specials and counter service. Semi outdoor seating in the front. Small parking lot.</text>

I’ve been going to Sam’s since the early 90’s.  The menu has expanded over the years and the food is always wonderful.  The sampler platter is a way to try a few things at one. I’m sure you’ll have a hard time picking a favorite. Mine is anything with the homemade BBQ sauce.</Text>

The half rack is my favorite. Get the spicy bbq sauce on the side.

We really enjoy sitting in the front open air area. Tuesday night live bluegrass is awesome for music, people watching and dancing. Get reservations if you have a larger group. No other way to get a seat :)< /Text>

BBQ was just okay.  Way overpriced for what you get.  Brisket was not marinated in sauce, they give you about 5 slices and a plastic container with sauce.  I did not like the selections for sides so I ordered fries and chili.  The fries were dry and I didn't eat the chili.  I will not be back</text>

Love, love,  love  the food.  Spicy meat chili is the best! I have had to make it a habit to check take out recently,  two orders in a row was missing items or super skimpy.  Little pricey, but worth it.< /Text>

I always come here for the ribeye steak. Love the way they char the meat. You just want to eat the steak fat, too, because it just melts in your mouth. Couple it with the regular or all meat chili and the potato salad and you're golden.</review>

Sam's is the best. My husband usually orders the combo platter and, me, the pulled pork. I could drink the BBQ sauce with a straw. Go there. Eat until you burst. Good craft beers also.< /Text>

Serive was bad. Lady at front questioned if the card I was using was mine, insinuating that it was not my card. The 1/2 burger I got was not a half pound. Maybe 1/4 at best. Terrible experiance.</Review>

Sam's Bar-B-Que is very good and quite tasty.  It is smoked.  I almost think it is a bit too smoky.  I enjoyed it, but ended up with heartburn.  That part was NOT fun.  The staff was friendly & very helpful. Would I go back? I definitely would go back again? Of course I would. Give them a try.< /review>

I really don't understand why every CA bbq place I've been to so far has garlic bread and no cornbread. Must be a West coast thing. They had a live band playing, which was a really fun touch! They also have some vegetarian  choices, which is rare for a BBQ joint!<//review><UserId.>100266734206924164630< /UserId.></record>

< Review>
Food was yummy and fairly quick to be served. Prices were decent for the amount of meat you ordered. They clean the inside tables quickly thought the outside ones take a little more time. We couldn't finish our meal so we took it home. Definitely not as good the next day, much dryer and chewier.<//Review>

Classic, awesome BBQ. All sides are delicious. They always have specials for something delicious that's not on the normal menu.
Their all meat chili is award winning over and over, and their chili with beans is just as good!!
Life music on the patio Saturday nights.
Been going here for over 15+ years since my first apartment, but like everything else in San Jose, prices have gone way up to the point i rarely dine here anymore since it's really basic BBQ we can all do if you have the time.< /review>

Normally I am a beef brisket person, but this place made me a changed person!  Not to say their brisket is bad, their pulled pork is just the best!  The live music at the outdoor seating is fun to listen to and gives the place a nice feeling.  FYI: sometimes they have other cuts of pork, which are good, but not as good as the pulled pork.  I am in love with the pulled pork!<//Review><Time>1539645086857< /Time>< userid>

We had a good experience at Sam's Bar-B-Que. They were out of the baby back ribs so we had the spare ribs and the sliced brisket. Both were very good. Moist and flavored well. The spare ribs were the star of the show. The rub as well as smoked flavor hit the spot. Didn't need any BBQ sauce!</text>

<review>I had the beef ribs platter with macaroni salad and chili. I guess it was unfair of me to apply Texas BBQ standards.

The chili was mostly beans, which would have been fine if the called it BBQ beans or the like.

The ribs had good smoke, good halo, enviable glaze, and good depth of flavor in the bark. But sadly they were rushed and didn't have time to render the connective tissues so the meat would pull away from the bone.

I tasted the sauce on a spoon and it was delicious. The sides were tasty.

It is not a bad place, and may have been a rough Friday night, but I can barely give it 4 stars.

Maybe I should have tried the brisket or pork . It looked good on other people's plates.<//review>< Pictures>

4 Stars due to minor issues, overall really good.
Ordered brisket, it was dry but good flavor.
Ribs were great, but parts were dry on reheating (low oven 15 minutes).
Chili was awesome, so was potato salad and coleslaw.  Garlic bread just ok.</Text>

<Review>This is a great BBQ joint! It's perfect for just a couple of people or a family get together. The food is fantastic. They have a wide variety of food for many price ranges. If you're a fan of baby back ribs I highly recommend them over anything. Don't forget to try their house made sauce!< /Review><response>None< /response><Pictures>None< /Pictures></record>

Inside feels old and run down. Could use some sprucing up.

4 decent craft beer taps but you need to know your beers because they don't.<//review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

This place is pretty decent.  They have a few specials,  but it's pretty much a set menu. You order your food at the counter then find a seat. This place is clean. The people are nice. It has a covered semi-outdoor seating.  My only gripe is the special.  It seems to be kinda the same few specials they rotate through.<//text>

BBQ is pretty good (for California).

The sides are not as great. Both the slaw and the macaroni salad both just taste like they threw in mayo and no other seasonings.

The service was delightful, and while it's a "fast service" place the young lady from behind the counter came to check on us more than once.< /text>

<text>I ordered the Sampler Combo which is a choice of three separate items: baby back ribs, brisket, bbq pork, chicken, Italian sausage, beef ribs, hot link or Carolina style pork plus 2 sides and 1 slice of garlic bread for only $19.95. I ordered the chicken, hot link, and baby back ribs with coleslaw and baked beans as sides. Chicken and hot link were cooked perfectly but the ribs weren't as tender as I like (a little tough). The BBQ sauce was good but could have been more spicy. It was a lot of food for the price. I really liked the fact that you walk up to the counter, order, then pay immediately, and the waitresses bring the food to you. Fountain drinks are available (limited options). Overall great environment and experience. Looking forward to my next visit to try something different!</text>< pictures>

Decided to check out Sam's BBQ. today.
As I walked in from the side, I noticed that they have a inside- kinda outside seating area that looks rustic.
Walking through the doors into the main restaurant area I saw a Southern style menu board and a kitchen area behind the counter.
The inside of the restaurant is also rustic with a cool train track going around the upper inside of the restaurant.
I ordered a 1/2 slab of pork ribs that came with a slice of garlic bread and to sides. ( I chose the chili and potato salad) I also got order of there Hush puppies that come with honey butter.
Chili 2.5 stars
Potato salad (meh) 2 stars tops
Hush puppies  5 out of 5 stars so good then add the honey butter (just takes it to another level)
Pork ribs soft with plenty of meat on the bones, cooked with a BBQ sauce and glazed. 3.5 stars. Good.
Service was also good 4 stars.</text>

I really liked Sam's Bar-B-Que. It's a fairly large and simple affair aesthetically, but the small touch of the train running around the room and some choice artwork makes it feel comfy. The food is really tasty, and generously portioned, particularly the pork shoulder & brisket plates. Also enjoyed the pecan pie, well worth a sneaky piece. Live music was starting just as we left, shame to have missed that.< /text>

The food is really tasty, and generously portioned, particularly the pork shoulder & brisket plates. Also enjoyed the pecan pie, well worth a sneaky piece. Live music was starting just as we left, shame to have missed that.<//text>< pictures>

Great BBQ. Had the Carolina pork sandwich, the wife had the pork sandwich. Both where outstanding. They serve the sause separately, good stuff but be sure to try it as is first. The meat is great by itself.</Text>

the brisket was a bit dry not much fat, but the ribs were good. sides were nothing special, but the hush puppies were yummy. prices were a bit more expensive than expected. beer selection was limited on craft but decent for the regular stuff. the parking is limited but there is street parking nearby.</Text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><review>Usually busy, but, friendly staff is also very efficient and the best reason they are usually busy is the food. My first time, so I followed a fellow guides suggestion and had the sampler, with Beef Ribs, Baby Back Pork Ribs, Brisket, Coleslaw Garlu Bread, and Chili AND IT DIDN'T DISSAPOINT. Kind of a special night as it was my first restaurant trip after my spine surgery on my neck and between residual anesthesia and the generous food portions I didn't even come close to finishing even though I usually do. Made sure to slather up the ribs with the house BBQ sauce before I boxed them up as I sure didn't want to miss that wonderful taste. Definitely somewhere I will be visiting again and again.<//review>< Pictures>

<Review>We love this place.
We go for the food but if you go on the right night (typcially Tuesday or Thursday) they tend to have live entertainment.  The BBQ sauce is probably the best around. The fries are steak cut and are good on their own but we like to use them as a delivery mechanism for the BBQ sauce :).
They're now open 7 days a week (but close a little earlier on Sunday).<//Review>< resp>

Love this place but they were their game off last night, ribs were dry and too well done, potato salad tasted like eating mustard straight out of the bottle. We will go back because I know they are usually better than this, first time in 8 years I've ever been disappointed.<//Text>

Secret code for BBQ experts: when you whisper "burnt ends" to the staff at this Texas joint, they know and give you what you need, quite rare and not on the published menu. Go hungry, get a beer and all the sides, do not count the calories, go home with some leftover as an evening snack. Make sure to try any of their special vegetables on the menu when possible. Lines can be long so go off hours or get takeout.

Some of the best baby back ribs I've had in a long time. Brisket wasn't quite as fatty as I like.... Prefer smoking pigs brisket better... Chili had good flavor, but too many beans for me personally.<//Text>

One of my favorite BBQ places. Recommend baby back ribs and beef ribs. You can ask for a baked potato as a side for a platter instead of the other listed choices. Chili is good. Prime rib on Friday and Saturday nights.</Text>

<review>My favorite BBQ place in San Jose. I love their beef ribs and coleslaw and my wife gets their pulled pork sandwich all the time. They can get busy around dinner time but we rarely have trouble finding seating because they have a lot of it. The staff is nice and polite as well.<//review>< rating>

Uninspired barbeque, with salt as biggest flavor. Restaurant probably living off past laurels.</text>

Not as happy as I was with this place since they started charging a fee for using a credit card or other "electronic" methods.  BBQ is ok, but there are better places in S.J. and they do not charge an extra fee to eat there. They have apparently been having some problems with their inspections, also<//Review>

They used to have a train track that encircled the circumference of the ceiling, and it had a cute train that would run the tracks with train sounds...no longer. We miss that, especially. We only go here when our favorite bbq place, Andy's BBQ, is closed.< /text><UserId.>110877257358177759774</UserId.>< username>

Love the environment, feels like a good BBQ place the second you walk in. Got baby back ribs, absolutely delightful! My two year old even said, "I love BBQ, Daddy!" Sides are decent as well. Will be back to try more.< /review>

<Review>One of my favorite BBQ places. Recommend baby back ribs and beef ribs. You can ask for a baked potato as a side for a platter instead of the other listed choices. Chili is good. Prime rib on Friday and Saturday nights.<//Review><time>1456400153196<//time><gmap_id>0x808e34cc915bd159:0x659ec9ee6650efc6</gmap_id></record>

let’s just say I have eaten too many pigs already :) so definitely know about ribs ! First thing (101) is you never eat a raw rack of ribs ...which is what I got in my first experience. I am ok with beef tartar but can’t imagine eating pork tartar anytime soon. Maybe the cook had a bad day or just took a break from cooking. Needless to say, never again!!
Advice to anyone daring to go, please check the meat to see whether it’s even slightly cooked so as to not be risky to eat.</Text>

Don't go too late cuz they do run out of food quickly. Since it's basically homemade I guess they only make a certain amount< /review>< pics>

Great place for authentic BBQ. Baby back ribs are juicy and meaty. The beef brisket is tender and served in good portions. The spicy bbq sauce is worth buying a bottle.<//Review>

This place has the best slabs of prime rib and BBQ chicken. Their sauce is delicious and adds to the flavors. Been going there for ten years.</review>

We were very well served by Vanessa! The ribs were just ok, that's why the 4 stars....otherwise the food was excellent!! The wolf turds  and Mac n cheese are a must try !! Brisket and Louisiana link were tasty as well !!<//Text>

Had the pulled pork platter. It was ok by itself...then you have to add the sauce. Then it was delicious should have tried it out immediately. Next time I guess. Cashier was very helpful as well first time visitor.</text>

We tried the beef and baby back ribs (very stringy), brisket (OK), salsa chicken (surprisingly bland, even for thigh/leg). Chili and fried pickles were good, and the place was good for groups.</Review>< Pictures>

We've been going to Sams for about a year since we moved from back east. We went there a couple weeks ago on Friday night. We ordered some take out and brought it home and nothing tasted right. Ribs, chicken and brisket was dry everything tasted reheated. There are plenty of barbecue places to eat in the area that are close and we will give him one more chance.<//review>

Food was good, but the service was very rude. I don't like to be treated that way, makes me feel bad. I will avoid this place.<//Text>

Ehhh, I've had better bbq...staff was not helpful, meat was fatty and dry..had to slather it with bbq sauce which defeats the purpose of real bbq.. maybe it was an "off" night for them..don't know if I'll come back.<//text>

Great food (especially the authentic Carolina-style pulled pork) made even better by the music on Tuesdays and Wednesdays.< /Review>

Update: they’re certainly willing to sell you junk brisket, chewy and fatty even where it shouldn’t be... spent 28 bucks on two brisket sandwiches that were utter junk. Threw them away.

Novelty BBQ for those who haven't had real BBQ in the Carolinas, Texas, Kansas etc.  This place leans TX style-ish.

Brisket sandwich was decent

None of the sides I tried are good, and they love their mayonnaise by the way.  Chili as a side wasnt bad.

If I could do 3.5 stars I would.

Try the sweet iced tea, has mint and limon already in it :)</Text>

I had the sampler plate with potatoe salad and leaf salad with garlic bread. It was excellent. The ribs felloff the bone oooo so good just the right amount of sweetness and savorness. It was resonable.</Text>
