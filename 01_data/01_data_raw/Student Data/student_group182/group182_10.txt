It is unfortunate that Midas would not honor their lifetime guarantee on brake pads.

Before paying for the brake work done on my vehicle, I asked the manager, David, about their guarantee on brake pads. After looking up my information in their system, he stated that the last brake work was so long ago that those are not the same brakes that Midas had installed. As the conversation ensued, he did his best to derail me and make me believe that I had my last brake job done elsewhere. So, I paid the entire bill and when I got home, I pulled the paperwork from my last brake work and indeed it was done at this exact same Midas on Harding Blvd in Roseville.

I called Midas Customer Service 6 times and was told that someone would return my call within 72 hours. That never happened. During one of the calls, the Customer Service Rep said that the manager of the Roseville store had closed my case and claimed that he had contacted me.  He NEVER contacted me. The last time I called, Cust. Service said they would escalate my case to Midas Customer Relations Dept. and once again NO ONE ever contacted me. After six attempts, I was disgusted and reached out to the Better Business Bureau.  Well, the BBB never received a response from this Midas either.

Bottom line – I do not recommend this business and be careful with their promised Midas guarantees! From many of the reviews, it is obvious that I am not the only one with a BAD experience at this establishment.<//Text>

Brought my vehicle in for a simple repair when I picked it up, the issue was still there even after spending $$$ on replacing parts which ended up clearly not being the issue.

< Review>
I brought my car into this shop to get the back brakes replaced. They told me that I needed to replace my front axle and it was leaking. After spending a couple thousand doing both services, I picked my car up, drove literally around the corner and the “brand new” axle broke in the middle of Ricky Ridge. The owner had to tow my car back to the shop and claimed it was a defective axle. It left me without a car for 2 days. Less than 8 months later I took the car into my trusted regular mechanic for a safety inspection and they told me the axle was not installed properly A SECOND TIME. There was a nut not even attached. This could have been a far worse outcome had we not discovered this.

Additionally, my young inexperienced son, took the car in for an oil change abd brake pad check (that took 4 hours sitting in their waiting room) and they told him that he had an oil leak estimated at $1300. He made an appt for the next day. I had him bring it into my regular mechanic, Bertinis, and they told me there was no oil leak and that Midas was taking advantage of us once again.

When I called and spoke to the owner, he was unhelpful and lied about what he told me was done to the car not only initially but wouldn’t take responsibility for the horrible work that I unfortunately paid for. He claims that I declined work and that because I didn’t do the other work with him that he won’t stand behind the work he DID do. I wouldn’t trust this place at all. Worst service on a car I’ve ever had.</Review>

I highly recommend this place very honest . surprising after I told them I want to fix the problem myself, but will pay for them to find the problem. Dave honestly without hesitation still help me find the problem and professionally found the problem after 5 shops didn't know the problem & most shops will not help you found the problem .if  you want to fix the problem yourself...Because they want to lie & charge you $100s for parts and labor. I've a 94 ford ranger which most shops don't have scanners  or someone like DAVE ,VERY WISE AND KNOWLEDGEABLE WITH all VEHICLES AND KNEW THE PROBLEM With out the scanner.
I'll be back if I ever need anything
Thank you</review>

When I tried to explain why we we’re bringing the car in for repairs Dave (believe that was his name) did not let me finish he immediately verbally attacked me for using the word smog and was going on and on about they did not do smog checks which i already knew because we had the car tested at another shop and it had failed the test. Thank  goodness my daughter-in-law  was able to tell him the check engine light was on and we needed to fix that. They did fix the car but we will just have to wait to see if the light comes back on</Review>

Free inspections help them figure out what is wrong with your car to begin with. I recommend scheduling an appointment because they are almost always busy.

< review>
My vehicle was left parked at a nearby business Sunday night. When I arrived to pick it up before I go to work my battery had died. Lucky for me I was approached by a man wearing a Midas work uniform, or so I had thought. Rudely I was questioned and interrogated  by "Dave" and he couldnt quite seem to understand that my truck needed a jump. "We dont do that here" told me to leave the property immediately and that I was lying. Dave I hope you seek out some form of help. Seems you may suffer from trauma or something. The manager at Goodyear "Mike" got my truck jumped and back on the road with no hassles. Dont take your business to Midas. The manager seems to be having problems and shouldnt be trusted he was absolutely delusional. Good luck to you all and thank you for reading!<//review>

The guys here couldn’t even diagnose the lights on my dashboard correctly and refused to look at my car after their “work” was done. It was laughable to see them attempt to upsell every customer while I was there. You get what you pay for!! I went to a better rated shop and it was well worth it. I wouldn’t trust them with my kids bicycle in this shop.< /text>

This place has people that dont know what they are doing.
Came here to reset/relearn my TPMS , and what DAVID HIGGINS  did was unbelievable , instead of Relearning , he turned off the light only and called it good. when the light came back 10 min after i came back and asked them to do something about it. HE refused to do anything nor give a refund.
i will stay away from this place , and suggest to go somewhere else.
no truth here , all about money and not help and especially not about people< /review>

I called the Midas at 212 Harding Boulevard in Roseville, CA and they supported putting me at risk for covid-19. Prior to bringing my car in to be serviced, I was told it would take less than two hours to check the exhaust. After waiting over 2 hours and not being serviced another customer came into the small confined waiting area holding a conversation without a mask on the phone, putting me at risk during the covid-19 pandemic. I politely ask if he would mind talking on the phone outside without a mask just as he was doing prior. He complained to Midas about my question. David of Midas kicked me out after he questioned me about if I had a problem and David defended the man chatting on the phone spraying his aerosols in a small space by saying the other customer has a health condition. None of the Midas workers enforce the law and I was treated like the outsider for being concerned about my life and health.<//text>

I support Midas wholeheartedly for helping us to get to the bottom of my engine troubles.  They provide total care for vehicles and are area great place for anyone having difficulties off the nearby interstate like I did.   Also, they have very reasonable and fair pricing. Keep up the great work!< /Review>

Further, when he went in for that service, the guys made sure to do pre-screens, saving him a lot of money by avoiding unnecessary repairs. With this backdrop, Midas was an obvious choice when my car needed a routine oil change. Plus as a new customer, I got a little discount on the oil! Great service, highly efficient.</Text>< Time>

They bait and switch you on the price! Called and made an appointment to get my alignment done was quoted $69.99. I made an appointment and went in the following day. After waiting there for 45 minutes they told me that they were unable to do the alignment for the 69.99 and wanted to charge me an extra 40% because according to them “one of the tech drove the car and it wasn’t driving straight” after new tie rods were installed, I had told them all of this when I checked in the car for the appointment. Yeah isn’t that why you get an alignment because the cars not driving straight.... on top of that when I got in the car since I have a dash cam I checked to see if the tech actually drove it and the CAR HAD NOT BEEN DRIVEN  since I parked it there 1:54PM and left at 2:38PM. I’ll definitely be calling corporate.</review>

<Text>Had taken my wife's car in for an oil change. When she asked, I thought to look up Midas as I have used them many times in the past. They seem to be everywhere. They got me in quickly and pointed out some other issues that may need attention. Instead of telling me, they showed me. I felt that they were righteous and were not just trying to sell me something. It is with no doubt that when I do get the tires I will be needing, I will definitely go to Midas.<//Text><pics>None< /pics><response>{'time': 1432836686999, 'text': 'Hi John, thank you for taking the time to share your experience.

<review>I needed front and rear brakes on my 2006 Pontiac G-6 which had just under 130,000 miles on it.  I first contacted one of Midas’ competitors, on the same street, that did brakes only.  The competitor advertised much cheaper prices, but would not give me a straight answer about anything.  They said, “Just bring it in and we will do a free brake inspection to find out everything that is wrong with it.”  I thought, “Everything that is wrong with it”, why don’t you just say we will look for anything we can charge you for that you may not really need.

Then I looked at the competitor’s Yelp reviews, and they were basically split between all 5 stars and all 1 stars.  This tells me that their friends and family are trying to counteract the public’s true opinion of 1 star.  Anyway, through further research, I found that this competitor used the cheapest brake pads they can find, they marked up their other brake parts, such as rotors, as much as 300 percent.

After calling Midas (on Harding Blvd in Roseville) and talking to Anthony on the phone for a considerable amount of time, I took my car to him for repair.  Because of the mileage on the car, I fully expected to replace all four rotors.  Anthony, and his staff, did everything they could to keep the cost of repair at a minimum.  I know this is hard to believe, but believe it!!  Thanks to Shawn, I did not have to buy new rotors.  He took a lengthy amount of time to turn, and ‘true ‘up’ the rotors.  And Shawn showed me that the rotors were well within specifications after doing so.  I am certain their competitor would not have taken the extra time and would have just sold me new rotors, at a very inflated price.  Shawn even allowed me to watch some of his operation and he explained the entire process.  This kid (I say that because I am an old man) knows his stuff and is knowledgeable beyond his years.  I am 69 years and in my younger years I used to be an auto mechanic, but this was when cars were easy to work on.  I appreciate the time Shaw gave me to explain the new technologies.

I bought this car new in 2006, and after the brake job was finished, the brakes performed better than they did when the car was brand new.  If you take your car to Midas, I am confident you will not be disappointed.  Midas is much more than just mufflers.  Like I said, I am an old man. :-)< /review>< Pictures>

<review>Long story short, I spent close to 500$ on tires, alignment, checkup, oil change and they gave my car back with my hood latch broken. I took it back and after waiting a few hours they gave it to me and the part was installed incorrectly and the parts around were left loose. After taking it back again the Manager didn't do much to help besides tell me how hard it is and how old my car is.
One of the guys was nice, other than that that place is SLOPPY, SLOW, and has TERRIBLE customer service.
I will not be returning and I hope this doesn't happen to you.<//review>< pics>

as a valve cover gasket leak with major oil damage to coolant hose and a transmission seal. Wes kept me informed about the progress and turned out we didn't need the seal but he suggested the spark plugs be changed as long as they were that far into the engine. Jonathan also helped keep me informed about progress. He was very helpful with my 2yr old grandson who loved saying "Mama's Car is up in the air Grandma"
They even took time to speak to my daughter when she came to pick me up and explain it to her. They also spoke to my husband on the phone to answer his questions. In this day and time when we think it is obselete, they gave us excellent service!!!!</text>< Pictures>

< Review>
I dropped my car off in the morning for an oil change and front tires. I called multiple times to check on my car and was finally told 20 min till closing that my car never even made it into the shop but not to worry because it would be safe parked under a streetlight all night out front and they would try to get it done the next day. Long story short, I picked it up immediately and will never return. Wasted an entire day and never even received an apology. I'd expect this from a Craigslist mechanic or from someone working out of a town house garage in Rio Linda but not from midas...<//Review>

Very friendly counters workers who greet you with a smile. Everybody else charges in excess of 10$ for a pastrami so i was pleasantly surprised when to see their price was less that $9. I have returned several times and my experiences have been superb every time.<//Review>

This is our 3rd time eating here because of how convenient the location is to our home. The first time we ate there, the food was so good. The second time most of the food was good but the zucchini fries were old. We gave them the benefit and figured it was an off night. We went there again tonight and it was super disappointing. We only got half of our order and the fries had no salt. I’m giving two stars because the hamburger was good. Every time we have ordered food it has been around 7:30 and it’s been the same meal.<//Text>

<review>Nicks is a mix of a diner and a fast food restaurant. They have american and mexican food. I got the 1/2 lb cheeseburger. It was awesome. They put a delicious sauce on it. I got some chili cheese fries which were good. I want to try the fries alone next visit they seemed delicious even without the chili.  I want to try the mexican food next time.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None< /resp>< GmapID>

Don't get me wrong. Nick's makes a great burger, not after ordering one on Sunday to go, it was delicious but a few hours after eating it, both my dog and I  were sick. The dog pooped all over the dining room and bathroom. I was up and down all night with same symptoms. We shared that delicious burger, but now I think the beef was bad. Can't trust them again. Too bad. Loved their burgers...< /text>

<text>Don’t order the vegetable beef soup if you want beef in the soup!  My bowl of soup came with one TINY piece of beef in it. When we let the owner know, she said “we have to call it vegetable beef soup” because it has a beef based broth”.    Then it should be called vegetable soup with beef based broth so it’s not false advertising!< /text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

Nick's Super Burgers is good to go. From breakfast burritos to gyro's and all the way to fried chicken. This place is the spot to go. You order and pay at the counter and the staff brings you your food. The employees are always friendly and professional and you can even spot the owner working most days.<//Review>

So far I tried the burger and the breakfast and both were very average. The burger was pretty dry and I wasn't a big fan of the dressing. The sausage with the breakfast was great but the hash browns were pretty bland.</Text>

Love this restaurant! The food is great service is great. The location is location is really convenient it's about a minute in the car away from Downtown Fullerton. The prices have gone up a bit since we first started coming here. But the portion sizes are very far so it does balance out.<//Text>

Food is always bland and definitely overpriced. I've tried different things suggested by friends and have not liked any of it. Service is good not great. Drinks have to be purchased separately no food and drink combos. Pulled pork tasted awful like old fridge food, the Mexican food wasn't any better and lastly the breakfast tasted like Denny's everything was premade and or frozen. If you like Denny's you'll probably love this place not being sarcastic.<//Text>< Resp>

I recommend the biskets and gravy. Also get a side of bacon. They also have decent coffee. If you are bringing kids, be warned, they have perfectly placed toy game machines so either bring quarters or be prepared for a disappointed child.

Other items that are good: pancakes, burritos and club sandwich.< /Text>< gmapID>

< Review>
Family owned and run. Great Greek hospitality from the owners. Quiet and reserved dad runs the back end. Son is a chef and mom makes sure you are happy.
I put their pick de gallo on my hamburgers for a very filling meal. Dont forget to try the gyros. Place is always clean. But the bathrooms need a makeover.< /Review>

I really enjoyed the breakfast burrito! it was full of great, fresh ingredients that really give your mouth a ride.
I only have 2 complaints about the breakfast burrito: 1) The cost of it is a bit too much! yes you get a large burrito, but holy crap, 6$ is a little too much for my budget.
2) The burrito was a little dry. There was some sauce in there, but not quite enough and it was all at the bottom of the burrito

I also got the Chili Cheese Fries. I just don't know if they were having a bad day or what, but there was literally no chili on it! only cheese and a very small layer of chili sauce.

I might come back and try the banana shake and a hamburger next time, they sounded pretty good.<//text>

<text>I lived in Fullerton, CA from 1999 to 2010 and enjoyed many meals at Nick's Super Burger on Commonwealth Ave. My favorites were the club sandwich and fresh banana shakes. Whenever I'm in town or passing through I always visit Nicks. Great food at reasonable prices.<//text>< userid>

<Text>I usually don't even bother revewing my service, as I know every day has a different story. However, I took my daughter to #nickssuperburgers and after an hour of fighting with her about where to eat she chose here. We ordered, with a few issues, but it was so nominal I chose to continue my only day off in a positive manner with my daughter. Her and I sat patiently, and quietly while we waited for our meals. After 25 mins. ( And noticing that the people who showed up 10 mins after us got a full meal for three people), I decided it was time to ask about our meal. The lady said that she did not see us... All three waitresses made eye contact me alone before I had to come as about our meal. Also, one of the ladies had returned one of the toys my daughter drug along with her. So, just to say that were ignored is pretty clear.. also I ifelt really insulted after I had set down the meals for my daughter and I are after having to un pack the order that was supposed to be for dine in was to-go, the, manager ? Asked if I wanted something to drink for my incoviennce. No offense, I just spent almost 20$ on cold fries and soggy bread . You think your free soft drink was a good choice to offer ? I don't expect anything out of this, as I never seem to ever receive resolution, and now I realize this is why don't complain. Hopefully some one will read this and think twice about #nickssuperburgers.<//Text>< pictures>

Winter for breakfast and they had pork chops and eggs very reasonably priced I can't remember the exact price I want to stay under $10 they have free chips and salsa if got vegetables like the carrots and onions and jalapenos they make their own salsa there pork chops were excellent and their hash browns were excellent the eggs were cooked perfectly I've been there for lunch and dinner their burgers are really really good and onion rings are excellent definitely a great place for breakfast< /review>

Ask for Carne Asada fries (with shredded cheese instead of nacho cheese) our go to for "cheat" days
And for hot days try their banana milkshake!

Tip: if they ask you if you want hashbrowns or homestyle fries ALWAYS go for homestyle.< /Text>< pics>

Don't go here, 10 people in the resturant, placed my order on my 30 minute lunch, took then 20 minutes to bring me my food which was just a burger and fries. They take way too long and prioritize other order in front of yours no matter what order you placed<//review>

Average at best.  I ordered the enchilada plate and watched as the "cook" placed a take out container into the microwave a d heat it for 4-5 mins.  Much to my surprise this turned out to be my meal.  It made the tortillas very rubbery and difficult to cut.<//Text>

<Review>The person that helped me was very nice but I did not get her name. I got to the store about 4:30ish on 11/2/20. She was by herself working. She was quick to get me what I needed and was pleasant. It’s hard to find that these days so it was nice.<//Review>< Pictures>

Always a great experience coming into the store. Always greeted, and helped. Even though the store may be busy sometimes, the employees still acknowledge you and will help as soon as possible. All employees were knowledgeable and professional.  Will continue to come to this store for anything AT&T related.<//text>

<review>I was helped by Jessica Ortiz. I usually do not do the upgrading of my phone, my husband does, so she was more than willing to help explain what my options were and the differences between the new iPhones and what would be best for me. I appreciate the time she took explaining that as well as explaining how to maximize storage with iCloud and backing up my phone. She got me started and I cannot thank her enough for walking me through it all.</review><user_name>Monica Schmidt< /user_name>< rate>

<Text>Great manager, very helpful employees. Came in for the BOGO to upgrade my line and add a new line in order to receive a free phone. Just took minutes and had to wait for my phone to restore. The employee that helped me out really took the time to explain with details all information regarding my current plan and we compared it to an unlimited plan. Walked out with a free phone and new monthly savings!< /Text><username>Daisy Talledos< /username><Response>None</Response>< Rating>

Horrible consumer service, I won't go there again. They said they would add paperless and automatic payment discounts to my plan and they never did. This means that I am paying more money on my plan then I should be.<//Review>

Very small store and is not corporate owned. Which means they can't do a lot of 'official' stuff for you. Go to the corporate store across from Oakridge mall to take care of your phone needs. The staff at this location is it very knowledgable about what they are selling.</text>

<review>The best bike shop in the Western U.S... Spokesman’s customer service is simply flawless. I live in Reno, NV and drive over 600 miles round trip specifically to Spokesman for my biking needs.

I know of no other industry in which I have so consistently encountered universally horrific customer care. I have MTB raced for many years and always dread needing anything from a bike shop. Spokesman is the antithetical example. I’ve fixed and purchased bikes here and it has been not just the pleasure it should be, but exceptionally impressive.

Spokesman has consistently provided me the best customer treatment I have ever experienced. The effort they have given to me is beyond impressive, so much so that this is the first review I have ever taken the time to write... Spokesman is the only bike shop to go to.< /review>< Date>

<text>I discovered after a long ride that I had tubeless tires, one which was deflating slowly. Brought my bike in straight from the end of my ride and they happily helped put sealant in my tire and provided me with supplies for my next day of riding. It solved the problem! These guys were so friendly and helpful I would highly recommend going to them.</text>< gmap_id>

Top shelf technicians.  High quality goods.  Almost reasonable prices.  I've spent the equivalent of several mortgage payments here on wheels and stuff connected to them, and have been pretty happy with the results.  One suggestion: when they do work on your bike, make sure they test ride the way *you* ride...<//text>

Pandemonium Bike Buying-Like many people I wanted to get back into biking.  The process is complicated with low inventories, high tech high price bikes.  Complicated with a lot of overlapping capabilities between trail bikes, XC bike and All Mountain.  The shop helped me navigate all the noise, try some demos and get into the bike of my dreams,  couldn't be happier with the new IBIS.</text>

My girlfriend and rented bikes from here during a weekend trip to Santa Cruz. The sales staff were friendly and helpful and the bikes were excellent. It was easy to ride from their downtown location to the boardwalk on the river trail, and from there along the west cliff trail.

Would definitely rent from here again. Easy, convenient, high quality and affordable.< /review>

<Rate>5< /Rate><text>Spokesman is one of the oldest bike shops in Santa Cruz, and deservedly so because their quality of service and selection is so awesome. They can support anybody from casual recreational riders to world class athletes. They give back to the community in many ways and support local races too. Parking can be tricky at times, but it's worth it. Highly recommended.</text><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None< /response>< GmapID>

Service department is top notch, Luigi, Craig, Harry, Lincoln, Justin, Kemin, and that attractive young man with the long brown hair are a real crack team. The sales team is also extremely knowledgeable and they're love of the sport really shines through in their work. Can't recommend this place highly enough.<//Text>

<Review>Great service! Rented a road bike to train on and Stefan  (hope the spellings right) took time to find me a longer stem and give me the low down on some great roads to ride. I have ridden a lot of rentals over the years and few if any shops take the time to help fit the rig. Overall this shop is a GO!< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

<Text>Wow! Service department is top notch!! Harry and Luigi are my absolute go to for service. I have a rekindled love for riding after a 15 year hiatus and these guys are patient and informative. I am now dialed in on a older  DeRosa that is a dream to ride after they spent some time setting me up with some better gearing. I will be back!< /Text>< Response>

Generally the staff has been upbeat, knowledgeable and helpful.  I've been quite satisfied with the two repair jobs they've done for my bikes.  - A shout out to Jason that works there - About two years ago I brought my bike in for some work on the brakes and mentioned that since I'd gotten a new cassette, shifting wasn't working smoothly in the higher gears.   He checked it out and found that the newer (different gear range) cassette hadn't been properly installed from the store where the purchase was made.   He got the parts needed to correct that problem and after his work, the bike shifted quite smoothly into all gears.   Good Job Jason!   Sorry I didn't give credit by name when I initially wrote the review. - I hadn't caught his name.    But I did see him today, (12/2/2020) and he was as helpful as ever.< /review>

Spokesman bicycle is wonderful. I can't ask for better service and accommodations, they make room for me, not only they was so honest and let me knew that they can fix my problem at no charge because my bicycle doesn't need to change the part at that time. I just buy some parts and I haven't have to go back till now. Highly recommend.
Women look for this great shop. Great service.< /Text>

Great selection of Specialized and other road, commuter, mountain and e-bikes. Their service counter employees are especially helpful for tune-ups, flat tires, and quick and friendly assistance while you're out on a long ride. They won't up-sell you. In my case I had an issue with my old e-bike that they solved promptly and with a smile. Thanks!<//Text>

I drive past five other bike shops to get to Spokesman, and I'm happy to do it. Spokesman recently went way above and beyond expectations for service:

Brought a bike in for an urgent (same-day) damaged part replacement. The guys in the service department didn't have the part in stock but pulled a part from a new bike in inventory so they could get my bike back on the road quickly. Didn't charge extra for the additional labor to pull the part or for rush service. PLUS threw in custom red cable ends to match my bike color scheme (without my asking for it), even on cables that they didn't replace, so it would all match. Absolutely first-class bike shop.</Review>

<review>The Spokesman is not a place to buy a bike, some accessories or get repairs.  It is a place to get inspired.  Literally their love of bicycles will give you goosebumps.  I have been shopping here for 6-7years+.  There are not many shops as well stocked, well staffed, clean, organized and on and on...  Wade and Matt should win awards.  And anyone with a bad experience should understand people aren't perfect, we all go over the bars sometimes.  But the guys that run this shop will make it right.<//review>< Date>

<review>horrible service, and do not recommend it. Try to sell the parts that does not fit, until i saw the label on the box. The mechanic i had, he had no idea and knowledge about the bike maintenance.
They might have fancy bike on their shop but they are not ready to serve your bike at all.
You don't wanna get a bike from who can not take care of the bike maintenance.</review>< Rate>

It was considered totaled.  The service technician said he wasn't sure if it was worth fixing but quoted me all the visual broken parts and labor (around $325). I was happy to pay this plus a little more if needed because the bike was $1,400 new.   He ended up replacing all the broken parts that he quoted as well as tuned up all the minor damaged parts that we had not anticipated all for the original quoted price.  He had it done in less then a day.  I'm soooooo soooooo happy I bought my bike to them. The other places I brought the bike to told me it was going to be double the price I paid at Spokesman.

Terrible customer service.

I brought a specialized tire from Spokesman Bicycles. The sidewall began separating/delaminating after after a couple of months use. Specialized is really good about handling any defective tires. Every other bike shop would simply return the tire to Specialized and swap me out with a new one....  Not Spokesman. The shop guys looked at me like I was making an outrageous request and was trying to take advantage of them. I decided to drive up to Scott's Valley Cycle Sport and everything was taken care of in 5 minutes.< /review>

<Review>had a cracked cervelo frame and since now and days you must go through a bike shop to fix up the bike, i took it to spokesman.  They dont tell you that the frame warranty does not include putting all components back on the bike for alot of money.  I got charged $350 for something that i couldn't help (manufacturer defect cracked fame), and now i am in the hole.  A bike shop that supports a bike company should realize that to keep their customers happy, they should offer to help or at least discount the reassembly of a bike. Not too happy about this, and wish there was something that could be done about manufacturer defects.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

<rating>5<//rating><Text>The service department at Spokesman has always been great to me.  On Bike-To-Work Day 2013, they set up 2 bike service stands on the closed street and were adjusting people's bikes for free. I took advantage of that since my gears weren't shifting well. While working on it, the tech mentioned that he recognized the crankset of my 1990's vintage bike. The Shimano crank had been recalled about 15 years ago by Shimano because sometimes they break, which could cause a devastating accident.  He said Shimano would replace the crankset even this long after the bike warranty ended.  I made an appointment and took it to the shop.  3 days later, the repair was completed.  I expected to be charged for labor and any extra parts (chain, cassette) but when I picked it up, the only charge was for the rear cassette which was too worn for the new chain. (When I dropped off the bike, technician Craig measured the chain wear and explained what was needed so I knew what to expect.) Actually, Shimano replaced the entire drive train (crankarms, front gear wheels, front derailleur, bottom bracket, chain) other than the cassette, with up-to-date parts and paid for Spokesman's labor.  Amazing.  Unlike the bike owner who complained in these reviews about being charged for labor to replace a broken frame that was under warranty, Shimano's policy included reimbursement for labor.  That's a great manufacturer.  I appreciate the knowledge of Spokesman's service techs.  They're friendly, skillful, and helpful with free advice. I take all of my service needs to Spokesman.  The store also has a broad selection of all kinds of bike accessories and clothing and they give free educational classes and sponsor events for the biking community.  This is a great bike shop.<//Text><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

This is your typical Friendly, Neighborhood Hardware Store.  If you are used to going to the Big Box, Impersonal Hardware Stores, you will really enjoy your Experience here.  It makes no difference if you are looking for an expensive item, or a simple 25 cent fastener.  They will take the time and interest to see that you get what you need.  This our Go-To hardware store in Paso Robles.< /review>

Never leave the store empty handed meaning Blake's always has what I'm looking for not to mention the expert advice, service and customer care the folks at Blake's provide. Possibly the best hardware store in the North County.</review>

Worst customer service. Not knowing operating hours I walked through the door and was greeted by a blonde female, who had the demeanor of a gulag prison guard, with the the words "three minutes". Nothing else. I quickly located the part I need and proceeded to the check stand only to find my not so friendly comrade. She rang me up and said "$9.69". Not another word. No thank you, no kiss my posterior, nothing. I like to patronize local businesses but Blake's apparently does not care for my business so I will avoid returning.</review>

This is a small hardware store but everytime I have needed something this place has it. Not only that but the people who work there are friendly and helpful. But willing to offer suggestions when you have a project and not sure if you are doing it correctly. Compared to the big box stores they are little more expensive and may not have as much as them but at least I don't have to wander around looking for someone to help me for ten minutes.</Text>

<text>They do very good with pedicures. But since the pandemic and they opened back up they take on more customers then they can handle and it’s not a lot of workers working .. so they tell ppl to come in and have them waiting for a while..</text><date>1620695877893< /date>< pics>

A few small parts of nail was not properly filled with the wet powder. There was a bit of liquid powder dried on two of my cuticle. There’s a few other minor things too but I won’t go into it. The person could have done a better job but that’s okay. The person was nice and accepted me as walk in. The person tried to complete the set as close to what I want. Also, that person took off $5 of the original price that the person told me it would cost. So I was thankful for that.<//review><pics>None< /pics><response>None<//response>< Gmap_id>

Im only giving one star because I have to. Do not go to this place. They are so unprofessional. They have posted hours that are not accurate. They close when they want. One technician spent my time showing pictures of her kid and texting. She totally did my toes messy and did not file them straight. I will never go back to this place.<//review>

It’s hard to find a good nail spot. I’ve had absolutely horrible experiences so I’m always afraid to try new spots. When I first walked in they greeted me right away even though they were super busy. Wait was about 15 minutes but not bad at all. The place is super clean and employees are really friendly. TONS of colors to choose from. Im on week three of my nails and they still look like when I first got them. Can’t wait to get a fill. If you haven’t I would totally check them out.< /review>

<Text>I was not impressed. My nails did not come out right and the lady that worked on them said they were fine I will not come back here. The color changed to a dark tone the day after and the gel looks like it was melted
There are blotches of paint missing I am not happy. Never again<//Text><response>None<//response><Gmap_id>0x809acefd98c09a41:0x5dfc79fd0160babd<//Gmap_id>< user_name>

My first time there. The salon is beautiful inside. I was greeted when I came in. The lady was very nice who did my nails. She did a great job and trust me Im very picky. I would definitely recommend giving them a try. Im looking forward to going there again with my daughters.< /review>

Unprofessional and horrible customer service. My gf and her younger sister went here to get their nails filled today and the lady working on her younger sister straight up ignored what she wanted to do when she didnt like the shape AND would slap her hands when she moved. All while on FaceTime. Do not go here!<//text>

I do not recommend this place at all!!  Horrible!  We had appointments and still waited quite awhile. They barely did anything and charged way too much!  $30 for pedicure and $25 for manicure. The manicure consisted of her pretending to trim the cuticles and soaking my hands in way too hot paraffin wax. Then she didn’t even paint my nails because she said it would make the cuticles too dry. That would have been fine if she hadn’t charged me $25!  What a rip off!  The pedicure was not much better.  It was supposed to include callous remover but they barely even scrubbed our feet with a super soft brush then rubbed a tiny amount of scrub on a few spots of the legs. Then she half heartedly rubbed the legs for a few minutes-Not even the whole leg, just a few areas here and there. Then painted the toes and done. Barely lasted 15-20 minutes.< /text>

It was another customer and us and they had us wait outside, she never ask us to walk in again, had a personality issue. Then, she went somewhere else instead of helping me and had someone else help me instead. The "yogurt" look more like water at that point and I just paid it and throw it straight to the trash can</Review>

They give a really huge portion of ice cream. One scoop looks about two. Turkish coffee is delicious and creamy. I'm not really into the rosewater stuff which I know that's what they're known for. I prefer my food not to taste like roses, but it's pretty refreshing for what it is. Service is friendly.< /text>

My server was Venetta (from the Paramount location)
She was very nice great attitude, patient and helpful. Great customer service. Had the Rocket Pop my favorite. I would recommend and will be returning. The place is very clean also and a good variety of toppings. I was greeted with a smile from the moment I walked in til the time I left</Text>

Have been to this location a couple of times now because it is closest to my home but I do not prefer it. Customer service is not great especially during the last hour before closing. During the last hour they don't even let you sit inside to eat your yogurt. I love Yogurtland so I go to this location only when I have to.< /text>

Looks like everyone is having the same issue with this rude manager that feels like she’s the bathroom police, obviously when you walk in you are there to spend money ! However the so called manager there is extremely rude, not sure why the owners haven’t hired a replacement!!! She wanted to see my ID over a $5 transaction what a joke!  Look for another yogurt land or go across the street where they have more ice cream places and where they actually want your business ...<//text>

< review>
I would've given 4 stars because we have been here a few times except that they refused to let my 72 yr old grandmother use their restroom without us making a purchase even tho I let the cashier know we were gonna buy yogurt for my kids once they were done eating and we were sitting right outside their store in the patio area eating. I understand the customers only policy in public establishments but if an elderly woman is standing there almost in tears asking please because she can't hold it then why deny her! Instead I had to walk her next door where they allowed her to use restroom.. It's called common courtesy and consideration for the elderly especially in the world today!</review>

Page says they close at 11pm, but it seems like they close whenever they feel like. I've been there at 10:30pm and they were open...went again at 10 and they said they were closed. The owner should know the employees do whatever they want, basically.<//text>

We came pretty late in the night and the girls working there were very generous with the tastings and the scooping.  I truly loved the Ube flavor plus this other one from Europe that reminds me of German Kinder Chocolate.  You can split a scoop and it will cost you $5 if you eat it in a cone.  My scoop looked like a double scoop so thats a double score!  Parking is easy in the back or out on the street in the meters.</text><user_name>Rea Jeffreys</user_name>< Resp>

The different options are to melt(😂😂) for. The staff was knowledgeable about the different yogurts & ice milks. Also if your not sure of what your about to get, you can ask for a sample; I tryed "Lychee" - I believe it's in the apricot family, at least that's the closest to what I've tasted similar-very interesting tho; also yucca yogurt hmmm☺ I will definitely return to this location.< /review>

(Translated by Google) There was no variety of flavors today that I went. In addition, the employee had her gloves torn and scratched her mask. So better not buy anything.

(Original)
No habia variedad de sabores hoy que fui. Además la empleada andaba rotos sus guantes y se rascaba su mascarilla. Así que mejor no compre nada.< /Review>

Worst food court ever. They are always losing my order when I call I and when they do they always say that Google Maps provides the number to other Costco good courts. Hey pendejos, if you know this is an issue, why not go ahead and fix it? Fuc king waste of my time and money. Never coming to this one again.

Also when I tried to tell them to fix the issue they tried pushing me off to the side and closing the window in my face. How unbelievable. May want to consider an internal audit on these useless workers.< /review>

<text>Roseville Parkway location has terrible service. I made an appointment, drove 30 mins and arrived early per their terms. Was told someone w the same name (and apparently my phone number??)  called and changed my apt to tomorrow. Then proceeded to tell me “sorry. We’re booked for the day.” I tried to get refunded for my wax pass and was told no. I understand mistakes happen but at the very least correct it to make it right. No effort from the receptionist.< /text>< Pictures>

This location needs to hire employees that A) know what they're doing & B) carry proper information. I called to say I was moving cross country and wanted to know if I could use my package anywhere. The women said yes, but then, deactivated my account! I then asked if I could reschedule my payment  for several weeks later because I would be moving and driving to my location. Again, she said yes. Needless to say my payment did not get rescheduled, and for some reason I was deleted out of European Wax Centers records. I am less than pleased.< /Text>

Needed to find a new nail salon near my to get acrylics done, and Glow Me & Nails did not disappoint! I made an appointment for a Wednesday at 9:30am, right when they open, and the place was already filled with clients, so I knew right away this would be a good place. I showed Tiff a picture of the design I wanted and she executed it flawlessly, I was obsessed!!

Came back 2 weeks later for a fill and color  change. I ended up having to reschedule my initial appointment, but they were able to accommodate me with an afternoon appointment the same day I called to reschedule. Leena filled my nails with perfection and then recreated the previous design in different colors for me. And again, I love them! Highly recommend, but make sure you're diligent with making an appointment as they do get busy!

Purple nails are the first visit, blue nails are the second visit!<//text>

These ladies work really hard so I think it was worth it. We had not been to a nail salon since before the pandemic. The service we received was great by Rose and Ashley.  These lovely ladies were very thorough & professional. We are happy with our pedicures. Thankful their business survived. I also appreciate the text communication & follow up that was new for me.

<Text>By far one of my best experiences I’ve ever had at a nail salon! Tonight my maid of honor planned for my bridal party to get our nails done before my big day! Glow me & nails went above and beyond for us! They were on time for my whole group, decorated the whole salon, had lots of goodies for us to snack on, beverages, and the sweetest gifts for me! They really made this whole experience so special for me! I’ve never been here before and after my experience tonight I will definitely go back! My nails have never looked so beautiful and everyone there was so friendly! Thank you Glow me nails!!!

<Text>I am so impressed with this nail salon.  As soon as you walk in you are greeted with a warm and welcoming smile from Tiffany, Long and Eve.  You receive a temperature check and are asked to wash your hands.  COVID friendly for sure.  I will first start with my Organic Pedicure, AMAZING!!  The bath bomb felt so smooth and silky while soaking my feet.  You get a nice scented mask that is placed all over your legs, then a warm towel is wrapped around them to soak into your skin.  The massage was perfect.  While having my pedicure I was offered something to drink and a warm wrap for my shoulders and neck.   After my pedicure, I got an Organic Dip with a Manicure.  It was just as good.  They offered warm towels for your hands too.  The staff helped me with my nail Color and Design.  I like the fact that you only choose one color and that matches both your finger and toes.  They go above and beyond to make sure you are pampered and feeling special.  It is all about YOU while there.  My technician was Tiffany, which I can’t say enough about her.  She is so nice and her work is Awesome.  As you see I had a great experience.  Highly recommend.  Please go check this salon out and get the same outstanding service as I did.<//Text>< Rate>

The best of best, I've been coming here for a while and honestly wouldn't go anywhere else. They care about hygiene practices and sanitize after each client which is not so common in a busy nail salon. The salon is well equipped with every nice thing you could expect out of a luxury salon. They sterilize tools after every person rather than reusing them. And you definitely get what you pay for. The service is what makes it outstanding. Katie is my person and I wouldn't go to anyone but her for my nails< /Text>

I haven't been to a salon in years because I always have bad experiences with the women all chatting away. All I want to do is get my nails done, and relax 😩.  This is by far the most relax session I've had I love the two women who worked on me and didn't chat it up about neither me as the client or whatever else they talk about. The massage and after nail work was fantastic I hope to get treated the same next time I go, because I am a very shy person. It is expensive but good quailty work always is. I highly recommend this beautiful place. I wish I would've got their names.<//review>

I have had 5 visits for Gel Manicure and Refresh Pedicure.  I am extremely pleased with the services I have received. Everyone at the salon is very professional and friendly. Special shout out to Teddy!!  He is very attentive and listens to your requests. He has perfected the Refresh Pedicure and is amazing. If you are looking to be pampered and spoiled I highly recommend Glow Me & Nails.  I am a satisfied customer 👍<//text>

Pretty upset that they are WAY over capacity for nails. They have no social distancing in place and the lady even tried to do my nails WITH NO TABLE. Wth.

I would have loved to get my nails done but I cannot support a business that is greedy.</Text>

I am so over this place.

I've been going since June. In the beginning, it was great. The techs listened to you and they delivered. But as time has gone on, the quality has dropped exponentially.

Yesterday I went in for a fill, and immediately the tech started pushing gel polish on me. I have never done gel polish. I have never wanted to do gel polish. I told him that. He wouldn't let it go. I just wanted color acrylic, I don't understand why Brian was so unwilling to do that for me. First, he tried to lie to me too by saying gel polish was cheaper than the colored acrylic but when I called him on that, he tried to say it was because I was getting two different colors.

Nice try, liar. Because I've gotten multiple colors *all the time*. And if this is something they're doing now, then that needs to be on their pricing menu because this is a shady and untrustworthy practice. Also for whatever reason Brian really wanted to sand away the skin on my fingers instead of my nails. Thanks for the injury.

Not to mention that I had Brian arguing with me the whole time about the design that I wanted, trying to talk me out of what I wanted, saying the two colors wouldn't look good, and when I wanted an ombre as well he again tried to talk me out of it, or tried to talk me out of the initial design.

You people sure like to advertise your artisan nails but for whatever reason you don't want to do them when a client is asking for them and willing to pay for them? Instead you'd rather argue with the client so they get something easier that isn't what they want?

And finally, I've had these nails less than twelve hours and already the gel is bubbling and looks terrible. This is why I did not want gel polish.

The last two times I've felt especially screwed, but especially so this time. I did not get what I wanted, I was not given the option to have what I wanted, I was argued with throughout the process, and at the end of the day was unable to use my rightfully earned rewards on my total.

I'm done. Do not recommend. Do not go here.

Not even going to get into how Destiny treated my mother the last time she was here. Quit treating your clients like dirt.<//Review>

My appointment was at 10:30 I got there at 10:33 they made me fill out a form saying I wasn’t sick. They then made me sit and wait outside for a desk to open for me, then then proceeded to make me sit in the sun for an hour without taking me back after 45 min they offered me water so I just left. The guy that runs it tried giving me 2 $5 vouchers for my next visit but I won’t be using them.<//review>

The place is beautiful, they have couples chairs where you can sit and relax to get a pedicure as well as several other massage chairs. The customer service was amazing and I love my nails. I’ll definitely be coming back, they even said if anything happened to my nails they’d fix them. So glad there is a good nail salon in chino hills with reasonable prices and great customer service.</Text>< Pics>

So far so good! The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars yet is because this was my first visit and although I absolutely loved Hannah's work as well as Mai, I have been down this road before where I give 5 stars too soon. So, I'm going to wait for a couple of visits then gove 5 stars! But I DO have to say I have had not such great experiences lately at multiple salons here locally in Chino Hills so, I'm really happy to have found Glow Me nails!

Ok .... visit #2 remember I said no 5 star rating yet! Well... had to return for a repair (nails lasted beautifully), when I arrived I naturally assumed that I had to check in on their iPad well Hannah my tech was waiting for me and said, no no you don't need to check in for repairs, I said oh really? Ok didn't know this. Well the rech next to us kept laughing and speaking to Hannah in their language repeatedly to where I finally asked, what is she laughing about? Hannah said, you and that you didn't know not to check in. Excuse me but, #1 there is NO sign stating, no need to sign in for repairs,
#2 this was only my second time in the place, and #3 how would she like it if she or her child were say in a place where the customs were different and she wasn't aware and was the object of ridicule??? All because she didn't know a simple way to behave etc. Customers should never be laughed at! BAD for business! Luckily for her SHE was NOT the one doing my nails!!<//text>

shop is beautiful, nail techs are friendly, and i love my new nails but my tech Leanne was very rough with me and nails were sore. Prices are very expensive to but you get a 15% off first visit. They serve complimentary drinks but my glass was very dirty with a lipstick stain.< /Review>

Do not get a pedicure here! This is the only time in my life that I’ve had painful sores on my feet, caused by overscrubbing! I have been in pain for days.< /review>
<Pics>None< /Pics><Response>{'time': 1571030781244, 'text': "Hi Peggy , we are devastated to hear you had such a bad experience with us during your pedicure service. As you mentioned that your feet were sores caused by over scrubbing but we are not sure that you got sores by sugar scrub or by the callus treatments. If by the sugar scrub it will be gone in a few hours because sometime the skin will feel a little sores after exfoliating, we always use a special cooling gel when applied the scrub so it will be cool down the skin if anything happen. Moreover after the callus treatments, we usually give our customer an organic heel balm which can use to soften and protect the heel after the callus remover. We usually known for our great customer service and attention to detail in everything that we do. But we completely understand that our reputation is not something we should hide behind. So, if there is anything that you did not satisfied with the service, you could call us on 909-606-8687. We'd like to discuss the matter further with you and see how we can make things good. If you give us the chance, we will definitely win you back."}</Response>< gmap_id>

< Review>
I decided to give this place a try after getting coffee next door. They are currently offering 20% off of one person, 25% off two people, and 30% off 3 people. Regular mani is $16, pedi $26, and mani/pedi $40 with an additional $15 for gel mani. The regular treatments come with a complimentary beverage of your choice - tea, coffee, soda, water, champagne, wine, etc.

Service (5/5) - everyone was very attentive and very nice!

Green tea (0/5) - they use a Lipton tea bag, which is fine but there was an layer of oil film or something gross on top of the drink and when I took a sip it was absolutely horrid. Maybe it was due to the hot water machine being dirty but that's gross..

Cleanliness (5/5) - since the establishment is new, it's super clean. They use a plastic to cover the tub and disinfected "new" tools.

Pedi (3/5) - average other than the fact that the lady cut a lot of my nails too short, super straight, and uneven. I also had to ask her to clean up the cuticles a second time. I didn't notice until I got home but she also cut my skin and it's bleeding. The polish color is really pretty. I believe it was #144 from the big book.

Overall, at full price I'm not sure if I'll be back. Maybe I'll give them a few months to work out the kinks and give them another try. It's definitely a nice nail salon if you want something really clean and upscale. Work is average at best - for now.<//Review>

<review>We’ve ate here twice now. The first time we ordered the Chicken Gnocchi and the Pollo Gorgonzola. Because our meal was really good the first time we ate here we ordered the exact same two meals again but also ordered in addition to those an Eggplant Sandwich. Although our meal was still good, we were left a little disappointed because it was not exactly how it was the first time we had it; there was less sauce and more grease in comparison and the flavor was not the same.

The Eggplant Sandwich was not what we were expecting.The sandwich comes open and it is impossible to close it without making a mess. We really enjoyed the flavors of the sauce and cheese, but found the eggplant to be soft (not crispy on the outside), and the bread a bit on the dry side for a sandwich that’s not toasted.

The first time we ate here, the restaurant was a solid 5 stars, but the second time it was more like a 3. Considering the lack of consistency in taste and product of ordered items we are averaging and giving this restaurant 4 stars because on a good day the food tastes amazing.</review></record>

Fast and delicious Italian food. I wish the bread had a little more garlic butter on it but the crazy alfredo took that whole care away. Do not be deterred by the long line either, it goes by quick. I'll def be visiting them again.<//Review>

<Review>I love Gypsy's!! Was introduced by a friend a while back and even though it's a little out of the way for me, I still make the trip for the comfort Italian food. It really tastes like pasta your family members made, and the setup is super casual too. I've both eaten here and gotten takeout, all times with no issues and the food came out fairly quickly (I'd say 10-15 min and that's when it's super busy). I do wish they did pickup via online or something but I understand the issues and since they're so busy as it is, I don't blame them lol.<//Review>< rate>

We tried the pesto chicken pasta and four cheese calzone. The pasta was amazing and the calzone was okayish. Moreover it was close to impossible to eat the calzone from the takeout without making a mess. Great options in the menu though and they have a good system for social distancing</text>

<text>I really love this place. The pasta was amazing. I got the pesto chicken. It came with garlic butter bread. The meal was a bit heavy but really really delicious. If you're in the area, this is a must try. Line is extremely long because of it's popularity. It was worth the wait though.  I definitely recommend this place.< /text>< pictures>

Delicious. A bit crowded but great food for the price! Pesto was delicious and creamy.
One star because we tried to order on the phone and they hung up so fast couldnt get confirmation on the order and ended up being wrong when we went to pick up.<//Text>

I had the salmon alfredo.  I appreciate how they let you modify the order to your specific preference.  Had it with capers, onions instead of mushrooms and bell pepper.  Hit the spot!  Oh, and they don't skimp on the salmon!  It was a big piece of salmon!  Thank you! Very delicious!<//Text>

Love this place. Near Berkeley campus so parking can be a b*tch but food is worth it.

Get the meal deal with salad and soda for only few dollars if you're super hungry but the portions are big enough if you just order an entree< /Review>

<review>Go to spot in Berkley for quick and tasty Italian food. You can never go wrong choosing any menu item here, it is all fresh and delicious. The seafood dishes are superb with no fishy taste. The calzones are to die for with tons of meat and cheese inside and the best crust. Do yourself a favor and try it out.<//review>< date>

<Text>Went late night on a Friday and the line was out the door. Completely packed, but the service was so fast. You order at the counter, get a number and pick up your food once it's ready.

Although they have several tables and countertops, all the seats were filled, but table turns were so fast there still wasn't problem finding a place to eat.

Ordered the carbonara and it was a huge portion. Good place to grub when feeling like Italian.</Text>< Time>

<Review>I tend to be very picky with any food that is non-Asian, but Gypsy's spaghetti/penne dishes always hits the spot for a noodle lover! Food is really flavorful, and they have a great selection of vegetarian + seafood options as well. Prices are amazing and love their late night hours.</Review>< pictures>

<text>Excellent food, but the pickup order process is in shambles. Pickup isn’t an option through DoorDash now, so it took eight calls to place an order. Hung up on twice and when I spoke to the gentleman, he took the order and didn’t ask my name or tell me how long it would take before he hung up while I was still talking.

Looking forward to the debacle when I arrive...in 30 minutes, I guess?</text></record></dataset><record>

Check your food! Ordered the Shrimp Alfredo pasta with a salad and it was hair in my pasta. Called up Gypsy’s and asked about a remake. He putting it off on door dash until I had to check him about it being a damn hair that came from somebody in there. He the says ok I can remake it but that should have been the first thing that came out of his mouth. Told him forget it, called door dash and got my money back. Huge disappointment.< /Text>

<text>This is one of those places that really doesn't need a review. It is sooo freaking good. Their prices are so reasonable. You get a lot of food and it is freaking awesome. The line moves really fast. I recommend to call ahead. Try their the shrimp Alfredo, pesto chicken, Alfredo ravioli, and their calzones. I mean everything is really good here. They make the Alfredo sauce on the spot. That is pretty cool and always turns out so goood!  The salad is fresh. It used to be a bit hard to find a table but it was fun to just go and try to find a place to sit. Now it is still busy and I'm so glad. It wasn't a surprise but it's just good to see places like gypsies are still doing good. I love this place and their food.< /text>< pics>

I had the Frutti de Mare and trust me they did not hold back. They have something for everybody, meaning a lot of vegetarian options. Some of best Italian food I've had and they all come with garlic bread! Make sure to use some parmesan cheese. All I can say is when I was done eating I was stuck licking the tomato sauce! I will definitely be back!< /Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPjfpRi4xvCCt4EQ45-1R0p5KkMoohFVQ7BY5dz=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< resp>

Pretty standard Italian American food. The calzones are gigantic and have pretty good fillings, but I wasn’t a fan of the bread itself. This is the chorizo one, which had cheese, chorizo, and jalapeños; the meat was good but definitely could have been spicier, or even more flavorful.</review>

One of my favorite food stops in Berkeley. The line moves quickly, the food is delicious, and the interior has really been stepped up over the past couple years. I love the pesto here and the white sauces. Calzones are also great and the portion sizes are huge. The staff is really helpful and found/held my boyfriends backpack for him when he forgot it in the restaurant.< /Review>

<text>This is a good place to get a bite to eat quickly. Which seems to be the consensus of the other folk up here in Berkeley. The food is pretty good, but it's not a place to sit down and collect your thoughts kind of place. It was perfect for what it was though, and it reminded me of the east coast. So thank you for that.
More places like this certainly need to exist.< /text>< resp>

Quick, dine-in or to-go place for pasta. Their pastas taste amazing, SUPER DELICIOUS.  Have been here for years. Good value for the money. The ambience and environment are casual, not classy. But it serves the best pasta in town.  If you are a fan of pasta, highly recommend this place.</text>

<Review>Rude staff, and for the third time now I've had to wait more than 40 minutes for my food while up to 10 customers who ordered after me were served first. The food is cool but the service ruins the experience and honestly I can make the same thing at home in less time.< /Review></record>

<review>Fourth time being here but first time this year. Tips is already included if you pay by cash. They usually refund you 50 cents to $1 less than posted. I thought it was just a cashier mistake but I guess it's the way it's after the fourth. Otherwise, great food!< /review></record>

<Text>This place is bomb. I was introduced to this place by my boyfriend more than 10 years ago when we first dated & now my husband. Whenever we visit Berkeley & want pasta dishes, this is where we go to. Godfather is my all time favorite dish. You can find high quality delicious Italian dishes in this little restaurant with affordable price. With just about $10.55 before tax, you have this amazing meal to satisfy your pasta craving.<//Text>< pics>

This place has good food.  NOT amazing food.
The excessively long lines that form at this place are most certainly not worth the reality of it, in my opinion.

If you ask me, the hype around this place is because of a dearth of quality Italian/Pasta dish options in the immediate area surrounding UC Berkeley.  Accordingly, this place gets much more attention than it truly warrants.

Don't get me wrong, the pasta here certainly is good.  Quite delicious, in fact.  I definitely did enjoy the white fettuccine pasta that I ordered to-go here.  There were some other issues, however, that left me concerned with the health and safety standards of this location.  As a result, I felt I could not give it over three stars.

We walked by Gypsy's earlier in the day and saw that there was a huge line wrapping outside of the restaurant.  We were intrigued by the hype surrounding it, so later that night around 11:40 PM, about twenty minutes before their closing time, we stopped by again for a late night dinner.
The line wasn't as bad since it was later in the night, so we were able to quickly place our to-go order.

One of the first things I noticed about this place was how incredibly nasty and disgusting the kitchen area was.  Food and gunk was ALL OVER the floor and all of the appliances.  Nothing looked like it had properly been cleaned the entire day, possibly even longer than that.  I was very uncomfortable and concerned about the cleanliness and public health standards of this place.
Additionally, the staff all seemed very brusque and coarse in their interactions - not very friendly at all.  I was left with a sour taste in my mouth about it all.

Resultantly, although I ended up enjoying the pasta, I strongly doubt I will end up returning, as I am very uncomfortable with the health and safety standards here, and fear possibly getting a food sickness off of something here because of the way they operate their kitchen.

I don't recommend.  I'll be going to other places that have proper cleanliness and public health standards, as well as much more polite and friendly employees.< /text>

<Text>My go-to for Italian food in Berkeley. They have a lot of variety of pasta dishes, all of which are delicious. Affordable, substantial portions. Can get crowded for dinner, especially on weekends, so allow extra time (~45 mins) for waiting in line to order as well as waiting for your food to be prepared. Sometimes hard to find seating especially for larger groups, so ordering your food to-go is handy.

This is the place to go for delicious Pasta I reccommend this place.They open till 12 at night. They are usually crowded and that's how you know a place is good !!!  It's not only very good but also reasonable prices on everything. Better if you bring cash to this place than pay for it with debit, you will save $2 per plate. Only catch each item is different price if you pay debit. So BRING CASH !!!  PLATES TO RECCOMMEND ARE PESTO AND CRAZY ALFREDO THEY ARE ABSOLUTELY THE BEST !!!</text>

My only complaints are: cleanliness (there was a hair in my food) and the tables and ground are always dirty and the way their order system works. They give you separate order numbers for each thing you order, so if you order a calzone and your friend orders spaghetti, they might finish their spaghetti before you even get your calzone (they don’t time the orders so your food would arrive together). And it’s sometimes hard to hear your number when they’re calling you to pick up your food.

Food is great but it is always super busy. I’ve tried calling multiple times to order before arriving and picking up my food but they never pick up the phone I’ve tried calling every single time before I go to this place because it’s a far drive and still no one picks up the phone< /review>

Always an absolute treat to dine here. Their pastas are the best in Berkeley and the calzones are enormous and tasty. The whole restaurant has good seating and they push orders out quickly. The garlic butter bread they give on the side is scrumptious, and overall the prices are pretty good for the amount of food.</review>

I highly recommend this place because not only do you get a big plate of delicious food, the prices are probably some of the best in Berkeley, for the amount of food you're getting.

I highly recommend the meatball calzone or the Italian Steak bits calzone.( they have their own special names for them but I don't know what they are off the top of my head)
I also really like that their kitchen is wide open so you can see how hard they're working and the real ingredients like heavy cream be used without moderation in your very delicious cream sauce dishes.

The employees are Craftsman at making food bit because it is very busy every hour that is open they are sometimes in a rush and even while they're trying to be friendly to you they're also trying to move the line along so if you feel rushed don't think of it as them being rude. They're just very busy keeping an amazing Berkeley culinary tradition going.< /text>

<Text>Went in on Sunday at 10a and was told to wait 10min since they weren't open...mind you the sign and online says 10a...I asked again was they open..I was told yes and than told no...There was a mexican lasy in their super rude. This used to be my go to spot but after this I'm good. I dont understand why you have the door and lights on says you open at 10a but I was denied service. Never again!</Text>< Pictures>

Gypsy's is the best. Parking is near impossible and the lines are usually ~10 people deep, but it usually moves pretty quickly. I always get the Crazy Alfredo with sausage, chicken, and red bell-pepper. IT IS SO GOOD! Good enough for me to fight the pedestrian traffic of Telegraph, find parking, and wade through the line. It is a hassle, but it is so worth it.

The price is also really good for Italian food. Pasta plates range from $7-12. The Crazy Alfredo is ~$9 if you pay with cash, $9.5 if you use credit card.

If you are in the area and want a rich and hearty meal. Go here!< /Text>

<pics>None< /pics><name>Kevin Oberman<//name><review>This place is amazing. Just over a block from the Cal campus, Gypsy's serves plates of delicious Italian food at really good prices. I had the chicken pesto calzone and it was great. A wonderful crust stuffed with chicken breast, cheeses and pesto. I had just finished 18 holes of disc golf and had not eaten breakfast, and I still could not finish it.

Service is order at the counter, wait for your receipt number to be called, and pick it up. It's selling to college students, not fine diners. I don't think anything is over $10.

NOTE: 50 cents charge if you pay with a card.< /review><Resp>None</Resp><user>109192281385634775270</user><GmapID>0x80857c2f6ba1fc31:0x66be74dc48f642b3< /GmapID></record>

Great place for late night meals when I don't know what to get. It's usually crowded here, so the wait is kind-of long. However, the food is as expected. It is great pasta, and I always get the Godfather's Favorite. Their prices have been very slowly increasing, and cash is preferred (cheaper by like $0.50). It's also open later than other food places, so this became a preferred whenever I had late midterms/finals.</text>

One of my favorite Italian eateries. I'm from LA but I went to school at Cal so I went here a lot and still every time I visit the ol' alma mater I love to come here especially if I'm traveling with anyone who has never been. Their calzones are my favorite. They are literally what I would refer to as novelty size as well. It's seriously ridiculous. Almost the size of a full grown turkey! 🦃
Hope y'all enjoy!< /Text>

Really bad service! 30min after ordering, I asked how much longer it will take them. They assured that me it will be ready soon. After 45min, I asked again and they realized they just forgot my order. No aplogy afterwards. Won't go there again!<//text>

My husband and I were out with another couple. We found Gypsy's and oh what a gem. The food is amazing and the prices are inexpensive. It is usually crowded with most being students attending Berkeley but it is definitely worth the wait. We have been back 2 time consequitively. It's our first choice for flavourful and inexpensive Italian food.<//Review>

<review>Went here for my first time for them to tell me they're closed  ten minutes before their website said they were closed. I literally saw someone with my own eyes go inside and order 5 minutes before me while I sat in my car to finish my phone call. And to think I was referred to come here. That type of customer service doesn't deserve my money. Up yours old man.< /review>< pictures>

<text>Good priced, Italian style meals. I tried the “pasta with Gorgonzola”. The portion was abundant and good tasting, but far from authentic Italian pasta and (especially) the Gorgonzola cheese was far from being what I was expecting (as an Italian).  From what I could see, every pasta is served with some bread with garlic (an attempt of bruschetta?), which is nice. It is worth a try.<//text><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

Food is really good, but be prepared for a wait. We tried calling ahead of time to order food, but they didn't answer. There was a big line to order, even at 8:30 pm Sunday night.<//Review>

<text>Coming from any Italian Irish family I've come to appreciate pasta and a good deal. This place serves for both. Nothing in the place will cost yippy more than $10.

I see why students like it cause the portions are big and cost is minimal. I just feel there are plenty of other "college spots" that have great food to match the good deal. Wouldn't recommend.<//text><pics>None</pics>< Response>

Don't get me wrong, its not horrible, but best ?
Who voted on this ? Certainly no one with any Italian blood in them.
I guess everything is relative. Its basically fast food Italian - although nothing authentically Italian is that fast if done well.

10/10 Italian goodness. I tried the salmon pasta and for ~11$ it was LOADED with salmon. The taste was great and the salmon felt fresh and tasty. For that price the quality AND quantity recieved were overwhelmingly good. I highly recommend for anyone in the area who is in the mood for affordable italian goodness. Did i mention that each pasta plate comes with a slice of garlic bread with grilled (I'm assuming) garlic on top? It looks weird at first but it's the tastiest garlic bread I've ever had. For the vegetarian peeps: they offer a combo of 11$ for a plate and a salad and drink. The combo only applies for plates less than 8$ which is consequently all vegetarian dishes (check if 100% vegan: I'm not sure if sauces or so contain dairy or eggs)< /text>

Yes. Cheap, cheerful no frills but great portions. Not a date night place but an old reliable option for decent pasta that's supported by many for a reason! A short wait to order at times, and more like a cafeteria style seating. But it's honest.<//Text>

This restaurant is different from other Italian restaurant that I have tried. It's cheap and the service is quick. I tried pasta a la primavera, pollo con pesto and lasagna (not at the same time, the plates are big) everything was excellent. Some of my friends ordered pizza and this looked delicious.<//Review>

< Review>
On a friday night at 10pm, we waited in line for about 30 minutes, then 15 minutes for our food.  When we arrived, the line went out the door by about 3 parties.

The salads are very good!  We had the caesar (dressing has anchovies) & Greek.

Penne Gorgonzola is excellent (especially after adding a bit of salt).

Gnocci with red sauce & funghi fettuccini (with mushroom red sauce) were okay.

The garlic bread is nothing exciting.  Next time, I'll request no bread with our meals.<//Review>

<Text>Pretty obvious by the perpetual line down the stairs that this place delivers the goods. I always customize my order and they never get it wrong.

The only thing I wish I could figure out is their discount system. Even when I pay with CASH I don't think I get that discount, as it's always the same price. Do not care though as this is one of my top 3 favorite restaurants for an affordable dinner.</Text>< pics>

A favorite of Berkeley students with no time to cook. If you're looking for filling, hearty Italian food, this is it. Make a great spaghetti carbonara. Offer a discount if paying in cash. Seating area is usually crowded.<//Text>

They cook in place and the preparation takes about only 10 minutes . Prices are not so high. I highly recommend to visit this place.< /text>< Pictures>

Huge portions for the price. I had the fettucine with pesto - the pasta was al dente and had enough sauce. Sauce was ok, personally I thought it wasn't seasoned enough. The food was very filling so I'd recommend sharing plates if you don't think you'll finish.<//Text>

< review>
Gypsy's is a great restaurant on the Southside of Berkeley, if you're looking to get a good tasting meal that's MASSIVE.

Most students around the Berkeley Campus are familiar with Gypsy's as it's pretty iconic if you're looking for pasta or calzones, and the value is tremendous. The calzones could easily serve as two meals and the pasta dishes are basically on that level too! Most if not all pasta dishes are served with a side of bread.All that said, since it's so well known, at lunch/ dinner hours, you'll often see huge lines in the store and you might be waiting for quite a while.

**Pro Tip, call ahead and place your order for pickup- save yourself the hassle and you'll still get the great quality food.</review>

<response>None</response><text>Very nice little Italian place. They have a good variety of pasta, pizza, and calzones. The calzones are giant too. The pastas are about what you'd expect from a mid range Italian place, and everything is under $10 so you're getting a good deal. They get pretty busy but they still prepare your food within 15-20 minutes. Great spot for a casual bite.</text><userid>101472686208485465930</userid><rating>5< /rating><gmap_id>0x80857c2f6ba1fc31:0x66be74dc48f642b3<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Text>This is probably one of my favorite spots in Berkeley. The guys in the kitchen here are working hard all day. They have to churn out a bunch of meals really quickly. And that's a key word here, "quickly". Despite the quickness of you receiving your meal after you've ordered, the quality of the pasta is still good. They have parmesan and red pepper flakes at most of the tables inside so don't forget to capitalize on that. I haven't tried the calzones yet but I'm sure they're pretty good.<//Text>< pictures>

We ordered meatball and chicken sandwiches and a calzone. The calzone was huge and it was good. The chicken sandwich was good as well. However, I probably won't order the meatball sandwich again. I wouldn't mine going again to try one of their pasta dishes. Also, try and get before or after the lunch rush because it gets really busy.<//text>

Over the years, their prices have steadily risen but its still a good deal.  Its often crowded with first years during the beginning of the semester. Their calzones aren't bad, either but the pasta is what sells this place. Bring cash!< /text>

Best calzone! Had their calzone back in 2009 and been coming back ever since. Their service sucks at times but the food makes up for it. Their pasta is great as well as the bread the comes with it. Cash and card prices are different. The calzones are  the side of 3 of my palms!<//text>

<Review>Decent Italian fare, not the best, but not bad for lunch or quick dinner. We usually go here for the calzones, which are pretty good and really large. Pastas are pretty good too. Make it a meal with entree+drink+salad for $9.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

Solid pasta dishes that come in a good variety.

The calzones are really filling and delicious, for when you're hungry, although most people would be hard-pressed to finish one alone.

Can get pretty crowded and is hard to get a seat indoors.</Text>

<Review>The pasta is sooooo good, and such a great price for college students on a budget. It's usually crowded so  be aware you may have to take it to go or sit outside. Too bad I don't have pictures.</Review><gmap_id>0x80857c2f6ba1fc31:0x66be74dc48f642b3<//gmap_id>< Name>

Very popular Italian place so it is almost always busy and crowded so expect a line. Most items have pretty small portions, but the value is still good. Some items like the Cal Zones are huge for the price though.<//text>

Finger-licking GOOD.
Always a long line but what can I say? BUSINESS IS BOOMING!
The line actually goes swiftly. Please go with more than 1 person so someone can snag seats!! People often get TO GO orders. Maybe approximately 15 mins standing/waiting time. Great prices & the amount is perfect.
Every time I go to Gypsy's I eat every bite on the plate. I have a big appetite so they give great portions!
If you haven't been there yet, MUST TRY!
I recommend the Gamberi e Capesante: Jumbo shrimp, Scallops, garlic in creamy tomato sauce w/ Linguine. $10.49 + tax and drink.<//text>

We waited for an hour but they didn't make our food at all. I went and spoke to the cashier multiple times but they always said they're making it. In the end, I asked for my money back because turns out, they weren't making it. Please don't go here.<//review>

Great, cheap Italian food.  Kept me well fed throughout college, and I always make a point to go back whenever I'm visiting.  I recommend the chicken parmigiana and the Sicilian calzone.<//text>

As an Italian, I have eaten my share of Italian food over the years. I believe the food here is one of the best values for Italian food I have seen. Eat around $8.50 with no tip as you order at the counter.< /Review>

Gypsy's, you were the restaurant I ate at when I first stepped foot into Cal.  You haven't changed since.  Here's to us babe!

What I would order here:
Godfather's Favorite ($7) (Order me!!!)
Pollo con Pesto ($7)
Crazy Alfredo ($7)
Gypsy's Chicken ($7)

Orders all come with a slice of garlic bread.  Portions are large and they do not skimp on the meat.  If you pay $8 total for your entire pasta meal, you will get an additional decent sized salad and a small fountain drink (all for an extra dollar).  No need to tip!

Miss you!  Visit soon, I promise.

Love,
Fei xx<//Review>

My boy and I came here for dinner after a few beers from across the street. This place seems to always be busy with a contentious flow of people. They have several tables inside but it's never enough so people spill out to the outside seating area. As we inch our way through the line and make our way inside this place has a unique feel to it. This place has won like a bazillion awards over the last 20 years and I've been told that this place is a must if you want legit Italian food. So I set the bar pretty high. Well, after waiting in line and then finding a table our food came and I thought that it looked up to par. I ordered the fettuccine alfredo with chicken. After I dumped a ton of parmesan cheese over it I mixed it all up and then I went to town. No joke, this was so creamy, flavorful and filling. I truly savored every bite. The garlic bread that comes with it is awesome as well. It's not like regular garlic bread. It's chunks of garlic cooked to where is really soft like a spread. It's packed with so much flavor and it goes perfectly with the pasta. This place is an absolute must if you are in the area. It's even worth going out of your way. I've tried this dish at many restaurants and this is by far at the top. If you go here I promise you won't be disappointed.<//Text>

<Review>This place is across the street from UC Berkeley. This place is open late. This place is catered to the college kids. This place is also SUPER BUSY. I went with my boyfriend after 7 on a Friday literally two days before Christmas. I though, "oh, most college kids will be on their way home." Boy was I wrong. It was still busy. There was still a line to order food. (I do not want to know how busy it gets when school is in session). The boyfriend and I waited 20 mins. To order. We get a number and sit down. My ravioli came out in 10 minutes. We ate my ravioli while we waited for his chicken strombli. 20 minutes later, still waiting. He goes up to cashier and asked about his strombli. Cashier says it's being baked. (Btw, bake means heating it up in the microwave) We finish my ravioli. We wait another 20 minutes. He goes and asks again. Cashier deliberately ignores him and doesn't say anything. The boyfriend is pissed off and asks for a refund. Oh, yeah, they haven't even microwaved his strombli. They forgot his order. We leave pissed off. If all they do is microwave food, it shouldn't take 40 minutes to microwave a stromboli.

So, if you want fast, cheap, Italian food catered to college students, by all means, please visit this place. Btw, my ravioli was good though.<//Review><pics>None<//pics><resp>None< /resp>< GmapID>

Almost always busy/crowded/noisy, for good reason: pretty good food, very reasonable price, open late.  It's not fancy at all, but it's my go-to after 10 PM (before 10, consider Pasta Bene as well).<//text>

Fast, good Italian. Not your typical Italian restaurant, mostly because it caters to the college crowd, but offers as much food variety as a sit-down might.<//text>

<resp>None< /resp><Pics>None<//Pics><review>A lot of the pasta dishes are very heavy and greasy... After eating here, I get a complimentary lip gloss because of all the oil from the pasta. I've tried a lot of different pastas here, and I think the one that is the least heavy is the Pomodoro. It's plain, but it's delicious, and it doesn't make me feel like dying afterwards. Great garlic bread! If you take it to go, eat your garlic bread before it gets soggy in the to go box :(. Calzones are also HUGE. I would probably gain two pounds if I finished one by myself.

Convenient location. Affordable prices and good serving sizes. Difficult to find seating inside for big groups.

QUICK STORY: I brought my friend, who was a prospective student, to Gypsy's. He was in the process of eating his pasta when a homeless man came up to our table, grabbed his plate, and walked off to a corner to eat it... A worker noticed this and took the plate right away, but this angered the homeless man who threw his fork at the worker and yelled something O_O. Yeah. Great welcoming experience for my friend. He's still came to Cal for college though!<//review>< Name>

I always get either the combination calzone or Godfather's favorite. The food is so-so, and the prices are pretty cheap. I don't come here very often anymore, especially since there are better places in Southside.<//Review>< pictures>

S'okay if you need a bite to eat and you're a college kid or a townie. Not worth visiting if you're from out of town. It's tough to get a seat, the food is just 'meh', and they call out orders over this microphone and speaker that are totally busted. It's kind of charming, but only if you're observing it, not if you're waiting for your food.< /review>

<Review>LEGIT PASTA FOR UNDER $10?!?! :O

I really couldn't get over the fact that almost everything on the menu was less than $10. Even cheaper if you pay in CA$H (by 10%) so I recommend busting your dollar bills to save a dollar :P

I got the shrimp alfredo and my friends got the clam alfredo and calzone.

Portion: 5/5 especially the calzone! That thing was massive! The pasta was also super filling. You can get away with sharing if you're not too hungry.

Price: 5/5 like I said, legit pasta for under $10?! My shrimp pasta was ~$10 when I round up and it was soooo worth.

Taste: 4/5 It's really good but I've definitely had better. Still I was surprised by how good it was. The sauce had good flavor and the pasta was cooked perfectly! Garlic bread was delicious!

The place does get busy and there are limited tables so big groups are probably not going to find seating.

Overall this place was the best find! Would definitely come back and if you're ever craving italian food, give this place a shot!<//Review>< Pics>

<Review>The best Alfredo sauce I've ever had, after traveling in Italy and all over north America. Everything is prepared hot and fresh with high quality ingredients with a generous portion. Pasta, pizza and calzone are all delicious. The crazy alfredo, calm alfredo, sausage pizza, and chicken pesto cslzone have kept me coming back here for 16 years. Must eat here!< /Review>< name>

<resp>None</resp><Text>Ahh Gypsy's how I love you. Solid "fake" Italian food in Berkeley.

so yes, 1) it's not real italian food. Come on we all know how REAL italian food isn't that flavorful

that being said I love Gypsys. It's my go to place in Berkeley. It serves delicious Italian styled food. Oh and it's SUPER cheap. 8-9$ for plenty of pasta. if you like seafood I recommend Gamberi something (forgot the name)

it's college student clientele. don't expect a great environment. just come for the food! :)</Text></record></dataset><record>

< review>
I went to Gypsy’s a month ago and even though it was a month ago I remember like it was yesterday. Yes it was that impressionable.

There was a deal going on to get a salad, calzone (under a certain amount), and drink for $9. My order was a salad with Cesar dressing and a chicken pesto calzone. As I was awkwardly waiting on the side I noticed the guy In charge of making the calzone. He made it with his bare hands and was wiping it on a towel for who knows how long it has been sitting there or who else’s hands have been on it.

In about 10-15 minutes I received my food and it was a lot, separate boxes for the food. The salad was alright, tasted as though it came from a Fresh Express bag and the calzone was off because it was cheddar they used and that tasted off. I gave it the benefit of the doubt and I thought it was a great deal but then I got sick soon after. Thank goodness it lasted for the night.

You get a lot of food so the value is worth it especially since this place is centrally located in the middle of the college campus. However, it is not worth the Russian roulette game. Do you like to play a game? Then this place is for you, if you’re looking for Italian food there are plenty of other places to try. When I’m hungry I do not play around and never again I'll play a game with Gypsy's.</review>

Good, cheap. Not necessarily fast, depending on when you go, but (to me) worth it.< /review>

My favorite restaurant. If you eat it at night, it can't be better than this. I don't know anything else, and I often miss this pasta while living in Korea.
