<text>Its a good school. But there are some teachers there that are just plain rude. One english teacher would give us an assignment that was five pages long minimum and it had to be a subject she approved of. Can't be anything Democrat related. And she would expect it turned in tomorrow. Its a good thing i got my classes switched. The video production class is very fun. Love mr Chavez teaching style. Good us history. And amazing chemistry class. Over all GO SAXONS.</text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

As long as you take all honors, your chances of getting good teachers are good. However, some classes are required, and those are the most horrid, disgusting, and stupid classes you will ever be in. Of all the PE teachers I've had, combine with what I've heard of others, I have not found a single one who was even half in control of their emotions and personal life, much less competent enough to teach a class. All of the ones I have had hate education itself, and wish the school could just pay them to coach the teams at double the pay. Computer teacher Freshman year had a habit of saying, "well, I'm not allowed to tell you my opinion, but......" and would proceed to tell the class  about how much she hates Republicans.<//Review>

<text>I Graduated from Loara in 1985. It was the best 4 years and great memories. Loved all my teachers and I learned a lot to carry on in life. My daughter Graduated from there in 2008 and also had a great 4 years and my son is there now as a Junior. He also has had a great 3 Yrs so far. School is what you make of it. LOARA Pride!! Once A Saxon Always A Saxon!!!<//text>< Pics>

<Review>I got physically and mentally abused by Maxwell Mane. One day, I was recording a livestream so my family can see how great my school is until Max and his friends came to throw water at me and got me and my phone wet. After that, days got worse for me. I was constantly reminded by Max that i’m a homosexual even though i’m not by using the F- slur at me. Never again I will come to this High school all because of this kid and his group of friends.</Review>< gmapID>

Many teachers are rude and immature. Always on their phone. I had three teachers the same way where they make students feel horrible and I've had friends move schools because of it. Some just put you down and you dont feel comfortable going to that class.<//review>

Class of 06, school was school, if you take high school with a grain of salt and just do your work and pass your classes youll do well. If you take it very sersiously and think high school is LIFE and think these are the times of my life than you're in for a HUGE let down. Theres cliques, theres sports, ASB, theatre (which was the popular all 4 years I went there) band, ect and so on. Be friends with everyone, WHO CARES. Defend those being picked on be a GOOD person and like I said before do your work and high school will be chill for you. Once a Saxon ALWAYS a Saxon, I enjoyed ALL my teachers and made a lot of friends from every group, I ate, laughed, was in musicals, sports, and ditched here and there, but I made high school right for who I am. That's all that matters.< /review>

<Review>I live within the walking distance to this place. Every time I walk through, I could see more than 10 kids (sometimes 15)playing here in this small playground. some with masks and some not. It’s a brand new and fun playground but not good for COVID days< /Review>< Pics>

<Review>I worked in the post op CCU back in 1989. At that time, at least, it was the premier cardiac surgery hospital in the Western US. Every night, I spent 12 hours weaning post op patients from their ventilators, which was pretty easy as the anesthesiologists were as superb as the surgeons. While I was there, we never lost a post op cardiac patient, not one. It wasn’t the cleanest or most modern of hospitals, but we did excellent work.

Now it’s gone for good. The oldest hospital in LA, the only place I’d want to have a triple bypass, now gone due to incompetent management. It’ll probably wind up as another high cost apartment complex, of which LA has too many already.<//Review>< pics>

<text>I visited the US in July of 2012 to take part at the World Championships of Performing arts when I contracted Appendicitis and was rushed to St. Vincent Medical Center for examination. The medical staff was very friendly and explained the procedure very clearly and was very helpful even though we are South African and was very unsure if the travel insurance will cover the medical costs. The next morning I was in the OR for an emergency appendectomy performed by the great Dr. Charles Hunter. Even though the hospital doesn’t admit child patients, they were willing to assist me, then 15 year-old, in this unique case seeing that my appendicitis had already cause abscesses in my abdominal area and seeing that we are foreign. Dr. Hunter signed my release forms 1 day before our return flights with letter stating the medicine with which I was discharged, giving clear evidence of the reasons for me flying with such high dosages of Vicodin and antibiotics. Great service and friendly nursing staff.<//text><Pics>None< /Pics>< name>

I don't live at home. So when my Dad told me my mom was taken here and had been there the last three days, i went to see her. My mom was a vibrant woman who was rendered speechless and thrashing about on a bed. I don't blame the hospital for her condition, but She was thrashing about on a bed with no linens and no restraints. She was constantly hitting her head against the plastic handles of the bed. She looked abandoned there in a grimy room. I took her out immediately to another hospital in the valley. She recovered and is speaking and walking. Again, i don't blame the hospital for her condition, but I can say I would never recommend it as it is now. I truly hope they improve. That community needs a great hospital.< /Text>

I don't blame the staff (or lack thereof). I blame the system. Regardless, I have received better, more hygienic care in third-world medical facilities. Be very careful of "extras" they tell you you need and the yellow form you have to sign for them. They are big added costs. It's the day after I had a big laceration and I'm very concerned about the state of my stitches and bandage.

This hospital is managed by a billionaire which is a but disturbing considering the very low-grade, unhygienic care. They weren't very busy, still under-staffed.</Review>

The hospital service is not good at all! The wait time to be admitted is longer. The nurses were very unprofessional from the ER to the 6th floor I was on. The room I stayed in had holes in the walls, the ceiling was badly stained and the curtain needed to be changed. I had to call for the nurse's to change my sheets, give me towels and other hygiene items to clean myself. The lab technicians were rude and my arm was in pain and bruised for almost a month. I had a few specialist working on my case when one told me I could be discharged and that was fake news because I stayed a few more days after. The nurses let the rude patients run over them and the distrube people that are trying to get well. I have been a patient at this hospital for over 10 years and this is the worst stay I have ever had.</Text>

< Review>
I came here to the emergency room. I been waiting for 4 hours for results of a urine sample due some how was misplaced and not examined.
So I been waiting for 5 hours with no response from staff.
Very disorganized when it comes to protocol of intake info, check in, lab work and results. There isn’t a clear path of communication among departments and most important introduction of this to an non existing protocol to patients.
Even the front desk security was away giggling and having a good time with his peers. Like I would love to work in a place that I got paid for been absent and careless of what I supposed to do.
Thank you guys for wasting my time.</Review>

<text>If I could give this hospital a zero I would, worst hospital ever, bad service, horrible staff especially in the I.c.u. The waiting rooms are dirty and so are the restrooms, I wouldn’t recommend this hospital to anybody.

<Text>I recently had a surgery here. I was so empressee by the service at this hospital. The staff was so helpful and kind. They all really worked as a team. They went out of their way to make sure I was comfortable. The doctors and nurses were knowledgeable. I would recommend anybody to use this hospital for anything they might ever need. I spent most my time on the 6th floor ICU. Thank you guys for the excellent experience I had when going through something so serious.< /Text>< name>

My dad has been at this hospital for two very intrusive surgeries. He was in the hospital for almost a month the first time and again the second time. They took very good care of him. They were accommodating to his needs and I can't ask for more than that. He is alive and I am happy! Doctor Arase, his surgeon is wonderful.</Review>

This was once a very dedicated and professional hospital.   They have recently sold the hospital. . I feel a week ago.  For the 2nd time. And it VERY VERY EVIDENT. there is something else wrong with my.knees.. both are extremely swollen as well as lumps. And on my arm it looks like a bone could be sticking out.  My Blood pressure was even high due to the pain.  They dismissed me and told me I need to see a orthepic surgeon without even taking a x-ray.  I understand that LA has a problem with the homeless camping in hospitals.  JUST BECAUSE ONE COMES IN PJS DOESNT MEAN THEIR HOMELESS...ITS 4AM. and even if I was homeless its more then obvious I need to see a Dr. .Holiday weekend no Dr to call.<//review>

Over the years, I have been in and out of their ER quite a few times because my family and I are stubborn goats who wait til we can't handle it anymore. This hospital has always been there for us. Their ER is very good with time management. They're a life saver!  All the staff there are truly kind and very caring. Patient hospitality is #1. Thank you St. Vincent !!</Text>

<Review>I have the most excruciating pain in my mouth. I sat in the lobby and watched everyone, literally everyone go ahead of me even the ones that came in after me. I was kindly finally td to come to get examined, the assistants who were getting the info was very nice but was only given an ibuprofen which didnt help at all, especially bc I'd been taking them throughout my work day and it wasnt even working then. I felt completely disregarded and neglected. They weren't helpful at all! And then the receptionist came out and asked for 150 copsy in front of everyone, she acted like I personally owed her money. I've never been treated like that! Not ever! I couldn't tale it anymore, after having spent 4 hours waiting to be treated like that was horrible! This hospital is horrible when it comes to patients! That are 3rd class all the way.<//Review>< GmapID>

#incompetent Came to the emergency room bout 4-5 am with my mother in law. For a bleeding  hemodialysis chest catheter .. NOT A NURSE , OR DR. IN SIGHT!!!!!   Patients who hadn't run been checked in sitting in the E.R waiting room , destitute. I then proceeded to ask the security person for a Medical Professional. Where he then stated that's not his job. Light skin fat Black Man. Tall. Me and mother n law proceeded back to the waiting area. Where we sat about 23 more minutes before two women show up rushing us like they were on fire!!! I just thank god my mother didn't bleed to death.. but I fell sorry for the rest. When we got to the bad after a short wait.
Web I got to the back it was hot.. and it had flies circling the place . Where they examine  patients.. yuck . If you really care about your loved ones, and you do. Don't bring them to this hole of #incompetence. Try Cedars Sinai..<//text>

Someone I know went to ER due to having mastitis and then went back because she developed breast abscess and both times she was given same treatment. Following day she had to go to different hospital and they had to do surgery to drain it. Staff needs to be more familiar with what to do in those situations  because someone's life is on the line. Train your staff in breastfeeding matters.< /Text>

<review>This place is worse than county hospital! Immediately I was told my ankle is probably broken then won’t treat me like I should be treated, I’m in excruciating pain and each time they get me meds hours go by till the exam and pain comes rt back and I have to beg please before you start touching me I’m in pain I am in pain management I was told to call the ambulance and go to the er I’m not a seeker! No joke these nurses here do be playing cards or making their patients go through agony, right now they are claiming I said I was signing out Ama, I never said anything like that! This er needs to be shut down they are killers and think bc we are by Mac Arthur park every person who walks in with a illness or injury is a junking the nurses are incredibly rude, this place is scary af! Never go to this er, especially for pain they won’t believe you and make you suffer and get hysterical. The nurse told me take your pain meds you have from home.... that’s illegal! I bet nothing will be done about it bc they all hate life and are doing it for the money and really this place doesn’t deserve to be operated because they malpractice and lie, no ethics, the er is quiet and emptied and literally you can’t find a nurse or all these patients they claim that they are busy with. I am reporting to the American disability act and every one in this er needs to be replaced by actual doctors who want to heal<//review>< UserId.>

I took my friend to the ER at St Vincent hospital early in the morning who was suffering from a back pain.  Upon arrival we the the check in time was quick thanks to her MD who had called in earlier, they had all the paper work ready for us.  Once I helped her into the bed,  the nurse came in and took her vital signs, followed by the Dr. who examined her and, ordered her to have morphine for her pain, which took one hour.  I waited for her out side in the lobby when I received a call to pick her up from the ER.
When I went in to dress her up she complained to me that the level of pain was the same as when she came in!  I called the nurse and explained to her who called the MD who came in and explained to us that it is not possible for the pain to just go away like that, he was kind and very helpful and, decided that he will give her another
dose of morphine, meantime the nurse had changed shift and, now we had another.
While my friend was taking the morphine IV I decided to save time and go out to buy her medication.  I figured I need another hour.  Meanwhile, I received few calls from
my friend who was in the ER asking me to come back because the nurse is putting
pressure on her and wanted her to leave, she told me that as soon as she put the IV
in her arm she asked her to dress herself up.  After about an hour when I arrived back to St Vincent to pick her from the ER my friend was dressed and waiting for me.  No one was there to release her as in put her in a wheel chair to make sure she
get to the car safely!  I went to the ER station and asked for a wheel chair to take her
out and the nurse told me please bring back the chair! Instead of taking her out themselves and making sure that their patient was OK.  They also forgot that I do not work for them, I am there to help a friend.  I am not done.............I took her home she was dead weight.  I helped her to her bed, while removing her clothes, they have left the IV in her arm!  I have pictures of that to prove it.  I tried more that 10
times to reach someone at the hospital to get help on what to do I was transferred
to a phone to leave a message and, that is after I explained my problem in full to the operator.  Finally I called her Doctor's office with the complain.  Half an hour later I get  call from the ER Dr. asking me to bring her.  She was sleeping in her bed I told him I will leave her a message to call him.  My friend was so tired end of the day.  I manged to call for a professional nurse to remove the IV.< /text>

They treat you very bad and are so disrespectful. And they gave me medicines that I took and I got really bad reactions, so I called for help and they said they don’t know anything about it and literally turned off the phone if my face... I felt I was dealing with high school students 😰 it was the worst treatment in a hospital that I’ve ever had in my entire life since the beginning< /Text>

<Review>One night I had a severe fever and shake, friend took to this hospital. They were shocked by 106 fever but since due to high fever I couldn't find my insurance card they didn't let me in. Finally after my friend help we gave them my insurance info along with my SSN.

They run some tests after two hours they were clue less about the cause of fever. So they ran all tests again and nothing. So they let me go home and told me they don't know what happened.

The fun just started, they changed my insurance $3500 dollars and charged me $1600 out of pocket for putting ice on my head and blood test. (I have full PPo Gold)

After a year I get a call from collection agency that I owe an other $110 that I have not paid them. I'm searching all my bills and don't see a $110 bill. The collection tells me that it's not their business and either I pay or they force me to pay

This place is an extortion scam. They dont know what they are doing and get 5k to reduce your fever.< /Review><UserId.>102291425503746729645<//UserId.><rating>1< /rating><pics>None< /pics><gmapID>0x80c2c70ba0aca2c9:0xc2089d618023a967</gmapID><Date>1551996438572< /Date>< Resp>

If I could give this place less than one star, I would. They're extremely unprofessional. It's like they never learned bed side manners. Many of the doctors and nurses there need to lose their medical license as they will also give you medication you do not need and if not handled properly, and depending on the medication, it will kill you. There was patient there I personally knew who died from "unknown causes". These doctors swore up and down they had no idea what,happened and then magically, she suddenly had COPD. This is a warning for any and everyone going to this hospital, its not safe. Listen to what all the other one reviews are saying. This medical center should not exist.<//Text>

They literally saved my life. Everyone was so attentive. I spent 5 days in the ICU with a bad infection due to peritinitis. If I didn't receive the treatment and care from them, I could have died. I love this place, they have been nothing but great to me.< /Review>

It started with Dr Yokoyama expertisely removing the upper lobe of my husband’s lung... the ICU team and the 5th floor nursing staff, assistants, took care of him.  The ICU unit has a team of professionals who review the patient daily, then makes recommendations to the provider in charge for the patient care.
My husband required one-on-one care when they moved him a step-down.  The excellent care continued.  You can tell these people love their jobs!<//text>

Had a minimally invasive procedure , nevertheless I still needed to spend 4 days in hospital after my surgery. My first impressions lead to apprehension, but I was pleasantly surprised at the cleanliness of the hospital I arrived early at 6AM for my procedure and had a very positive experience on entering and through the check in process.

The preparation station was busy but was very professionally managed and staffed. Everyone from my immediate nurse to the anesthesiologist was very attentive and assuring. Again the station was very clean and professionally managed.

After my operation I was moved to level 6 into a private room. The 3 days I spent here were just outstanding and before I get to recognizing some of the staff that personally cared for me, I would just like to add that the rooms were ultra clean with a freshly made bed whenever possible, hospital food is just that, but when I requested a tuna on wheat sandwich I was amazed when my nurse Angus called down to the cafeteria to see if it was anywhere on the menu, disappointingly she was told no and after a short conversation with the cafeteria manager she said my sandwich would be on its way, I got the impression that the tuna would have to be brought in to the hospital. After not eating for 3 days I can tell you it was delicious, after that I was able to pick and mix food from the menu which to me was very varied in its choice for a hospital.

I had a total of 5 nurses and 6 nursing assistants. The only one negative encounter I had was with one of the nursing assistants that I can only think was not aware of my procedure and mishandled me. Other than that all of the other assistants were just great with a special thanks to Cory and Ron.

My immediate nurses were just unbelievable, professional, attentive and very understanding. In the most desperate time of my recovery I have to give a very special thanks to Ashley, she was very understanding of my requests and worked with me when I was in such pain, and at times we had a very educational discussion and she even brought a smile out of me, Ashley is a true professional a very well educated person with a great character. Another big thank you to Agnus, kamatsu, Anna and Cheryl who were all my other nurses and performed their duties attentively and again very professionally. Bianca my physical therapist was just a total dream she got me on my feet and was there at all times very professional and a great sense of humor.

I really cannot say enough about my experience at St Vincent hence my detailed review I remember commenting to Bianca that "I thought St Vincent hospital was as good as the hospitals in the UK "  where I am originally from.

Thank you St Vincent and all its staff. TC< /Review>

<Review>I was in the neighbourhood and had to go to the emergency room with shooting pains in my left ear.

The staff were patient and calm, reasonable and friendly. The admissions man was really professional and concerned and insisted on being very specific about the pain and the location of said pain.

The nurses were magnificent and kind. The doctor was pleasant, super quick to identify the problem and had a great sense of humour/bedside manner.

Compared to private clinics I've been to in the US (blood tests and vaccinations for green cards etc) it was spotlessly clean and neat, almost at the standard I''ve come to expect from British hospitals.

The place wasn't too busy and they had me in and out of there in about 75 minutes. All in all a five star experience< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

Be careful in this hospital. Unfortunately if you have a sudden death in the family and you let some of the Emergency Room staff know, they’ll just laugh behind your back. When you confront them, they just sit there shocked not knowing what to say. Unfortunately I made a report for this and the hospital has done NOTHING to take actions of this. Real unprofessional.<//Text>

I waited here for a long time they didn’t help at all the receptionist a fat girl with glasses (left side room) is beyond rude. There was no nurse at the front room not even to check vital signs. I walked to the next room where they send u after they check ur vitals and to my surprise it was empty.. so there’s an empty room with no patients and a lobby full of patients where’s the nurse??? No nurse no doctor on a Friday night!!! These ppl certainly don’t deserve to be in the medical field. I hope if somebody else has a bad experience as well they don’t hesitate to rate this hospital with a one star.< /Text>

<text>If I could give this place a ZERO star it would be great. I went to see one of the doctors for a infection I've had since October of last year and all he did was write me a prescription for antibiotics. I told him I've tried several kinds if antibiotics, including iv antibiotics and it doesn't get rid of my infections, and he didn't listen to me. He still insisted I take the stupid antibiotic. And his rude staffers were asking me if I had been hospitalized for this issue and I said yes I have, but I didn't get better there too. Avoid this place and Hollywood presbeteryan hospital. They're the worst hospitals EVER. Go to ucla or Kaiser.<//text>< pictures>

One of the worst hospitals I’ve ever been to! The ambulance took my mom there because it was the closest to her home . They took ekg and echo test on her early in the morning 6 am they said she needs a stress test and can’t eat all day 7 am new nurse came “ Lorna” she was on the 5th floor one of the most nurses I ever met in my life ! Until 4 pm she kept telling us there Coming to pick her up and finally at 6 they came mind you al day we kept asking her where the dr was to tell us the results of the echo and ekg that was done early in the morning her response I dunno were waiting I dunno were waiting she didn’t even walk in her room to give my mom water ! After another hour she left because her shift was over without even saying a word ! After another hour they said oh we can’t do anything today we have to wait for tomorrow I finally got a charge nurse to tell me her ekg is good that was all ! Lorna I hope you get your license revoked because your nothing but trash for treating my mom that way I will never ever ever go to that hospital again or let anyone I know go there !< /review>

Worst experience ever!  From no communication in the waiting room to extremely rude people that laughed at me when I was feeling ill and I did not even get a bed and was charged $3,523 for an IV of Zofran sitting in a chair in a waiting area.  I’ve called to dispute and they are trying to wear me down by playing the old I can’t find your account trick. This is criminal! Time to step up and be professional St Vincent’s. I would like somebody to help resolve this issue.< /Review>

My mother recently was taken "care of" at this hospital which isn't the best or has  the most professional staff. The staff was actually laughing at my mom which made her go crazy because she was in pain and an actual so called "Nurse" had the audacity to be so rude. How could this staff get away with stuff like this. This hospital NEEDS a secret thorough investigation on how they treat patients because they will find a lot of criminal activity going on. My mom had a toe that was turning black so they had to cut it off but before they did they kept sending my mom home with antibiotics everytime she would go to the ER then it eventually resulted in her having to get all her toes removed off of one foot. We will be taking legal action because these staff members could of prevented that from happening but they told my mom that she would have to cut off her toes to prevent future pain but she is still on pain. Makes no sense at all. I'm really starting to wonder if all the staff members volunteer here or what because they work as if they aren't getting paid or something! Very Very Unprofessional I recommend UCLA!<//text>

<Text>Their verdict: abdominal pain from an unknown cause. Even though I repeatedly told them of my gastirtis, something I've gone to the hospital for before.

<text>Dont ever come to this pos hospital. Called couple of times, left a voicemail with the business department regarding an accounting issue. Called throughout the week, yet no call backs. Theyve sent my dads bill to collection before sending it to our address. Now the collection agency is threatening to default and ruin my dads credit. Pos need to burn in hell. Hope you lousy fs get what you deserve and thats me being calm. Maybe you morons should change the name of your hospital. St vincent would be rolling in his grave.< /text>< Pictures>

<Rating>1< /Rating><text>This experience was the worst I have had - hence this effort. The doctor began treating me by saying what he wasn't going to do before examining me or my ankle.
I was then perscibed Naxoproxin which was the drug of choice to all women for pain that night. I immediately had adverse effects - (the ones they tell you to seek a physician for) and told the nurse and was perscibed more.

Without the other negative reviews - I thought perhaps they were racist and just wanted me to die but as it turns out the staff there generally acts as if scorned to help people or listen to their concern (or any feedback). To treat people so carelessly, who seek them for assistance, they truly deserve a special seat in hell.

Please do not go there - they don't want anyone there.</text><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

<Time>1495548467444<//Time><Rating>2< /Rating><text>My grandmother is in the ICU at this hospital. I have had to deal with pushing that she not be coded DNR, but I'm meeting resistance from her doctor who took a Hippocratic oath.
He told me to my face that he was talking to my children because he believed "the younger generation is smarter."  He had never met us prior to stating this, and I hold a B.S.B.A., graduating Summa Cum Laude.

One of the nurses scolded me after returning home to "call more". I call twice a day and had driven hours to see her. The nurses staff doesn't even want to answer the doggone phone when we showed up to visit.

The majority of the staff we dealt with is extremely rude. I have to exclude Nikki, Jessica, and my grandmother's social worker from that though as they were quite congenial. I will be complaining directly to the hospital in greater detail about my experience and I encourage others to do the same. Want positive change? Speak up.<//text>< Pictures>

Best care in ER I have ever received, and for the past 16years Ihave been in and out of ER rooms because of a heart condition, for the 1st (11) of those years no less than (1) time per year...so iIdo understand and know the ER process very well.

most of the front desk staff condone illegal criminal activity! security guards are rude careless and they are lazy, i seen a security guard in house assault a patient while under restraints, and the doctor some white guy with a beard blonde, usually works at night was laughing about the whole thing and made a bunch of lies to the psychaitrist telling him that because im part of a gang i dont need to be here, these criminal doctors always try to clear a patient with disregards of the persons care or obvious symtoms these are practical malpractice criminals, the doctors get away with authority abuse, but only one doctor has done this to me persoanally, watch out when you go to saint vincents,<//Text>

<review>To let you know this hospital had in 2003 did a transplant on a a saudi with money .thats why people who were on the transplant waiting list were put off for another day .then to hide what they did took all the patient records and rolled them out the back and tossed them in the trash where they were later found. this was written about in the local papers.
I went there for a transplant and they almost killed me. if thats not bad enough they send bills to me ,not from the hospital but from a collection agency. I didn't know exactly why until I found out they can't bill the insurance the full amount of the bill because they pay a reduced amount ,so its more viable to bill patients for the higher amount, and use a quasi bill collector to force you to pay the bigger amount or they jack up your credit. seems they have all there angles covered . They jack you up and then they steal all your money.Thats their support program. if this sounds familiar then you know this is just the tip of the iceberg< /review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None< /Response><GmapID>0x80c2c70ba0aca2c9:0xc2089d618023a967<//GmapID></record>

It is so disgusting that one of the nurses doesn't know Revlimid, a chemotherapy medicine. She insisted that it is a vitamin. She wanted to give this medicine without the accompanying Decadron.< /Review>

Bait and switch billing,  avoid at all cost!. They would tell you you're covered 100% with zero out-of-pocket/co-pay, then after two years will send your account to a collection agency without providing you an itemized bill.  Like a county hospital back in the 60's, just without the ethics required by a health care provider.<//text>

The worst experience ever. I worked here a little under a year and the emergency staff is very unprofessional and disrespectful to patients and visitors. I have never seen people treated so poorly and not just as a bystander but as a  staff member. The security staff is very untrained and I was always shocked at the disrespect and racism that took place.<//Review>

Have been to the emergency room once. Felt well and quite save there. They tested my blood and injured me an infusion, which helped me very much. The whole team was very friendly and we are still in contact via facebook:)</Text>

<Review>(Translated by Google) Accompany the father of my children because his eyes felt very bad and even though we asked for help, we did not receive any help ... apart from that we had to wait a long time in the waiting room, we were not the only ones there were many patients complaining of pain and the nurses didn't care at all, I think the medical profession also requires empathy towards others but here I think they only care about money and if you don't have health insurance they let you die

(Original)
Acompañe al padre de mis hijos porque se sentía muy mal de sus ojos y por más que pedimos que nos ayudarán no recibimos ningún tipo de ayuda... aparte tuvimos que esperar bastante tiempo en la sala de espera, no éramos los únicos habi a muchos pacientes quejándose de dolor y los enfermeros no les importaba en lo absoluto,creo que la profesión de médico también requiere empatía hacia los demás pero aquí creo que sólo les importa el dinero y si no tienes una aseguranza médica te dejan morir</Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

(Translated by Google) The worst that
lived in my life I would not even want to give a star but it had to be done
Please do not go to that place that bad, take my mom in an emergency and there were only Filipinos who bought the licenses in their country and they do not know anything they did not know how to speak English or Spanish or anything they were doing. to dismantle and leave it worse how she went then they interned her only was the Philippines again trying badly to breastfeed until she tried dr Mad and they laughed and made fun of my mom and she did not care what she said yes mama Nesesitaba something I put to the complaint and it was worse for I got a nurs without the tag so I could not identify my mom and told her that today it would be worse for you, so that the bad experiences continued until I was better. I took her out and took her to another place where she was treated well. Blessed God. I think they should not give work to so much Filipino who brings his license from his country because what is only bought and as people are not animals

Lo peor que
vivido en mi vida no quisiera ni dar una estrella pero había que hacerlo
Por favor no vallan a ése ese lugar ese malisimo lleve a a mi mamá en una emergencia y habían solo filipinos  estos que compran las licencias en su paiz y no saben nada no sabían hablar de inglés ni Español ni nada estaban poniendo amama cosas que la te llevaron a desmallar ya dejarla peor cómo iva luego la internaron solo is habían Filipinas otra ves tratando mal amama hasta tratando dr Loca yse reían y burlaban de la mi mama y nO le importaba lo que y decía sí mamá Nesesitaba algo puse al queja y fue peor por quw llego una nurs sin el tag para no poder identificarla a a mamá y le dijo que hoy te ira peor así que qué siguieron las malas experiencias hasta estar mejor la saqué ya lleve para otro lado lugar dónde la trataron bien Bendito Dios . Opino lo no deberían dar trabajo a tanto filipino que trae su licencia de su paiz ya que qué es soló la compran y al as personas no somos animales< /Text>

This place has the lowest gas prices along the 395 Hwy! Gas stations 100-200 miles north charge almost $2 mores per gallon. They also have great prices on drinks and snacks as well. Restrooms are clean, service was good, and I got a large cup of coffee for $0.49 because I purchased gas!</text>

<Text>This place rocks!  A must stop on your way to and from Mammoth.  The best gas prices on 395.  The bathrooms are always clean.  There is a small casino with a reputation for loose slots.  They even have a cannabis dispensary with a drive-through so you don't even have to leave your car to replenish your supply.</Text><name>Dwayne Miller</name></record>

Also, they were displaying a price 7 cents cheaper for southbound travelers yesterday that was not available even if paying cash/debit.  Very frustrating to find this out after wasting time waiting in line for gas. This place lures travelers in with advertising false prices which is B.S. For better prices than this place I would tank up in Bishop.</Review>< Name>

I love this gas station! Best place to stop for the bathroom on the way to or from Mammoth. they are actually clean, unlike most of the other places I've stopped at in the past. Friendly staff, clean open layout, not cluttered. Small casino next door, and last time I came through I saw they have a cool dispensary they just opened up on the other side of the lot! 😜<//Text>

Very loudly said "I need to clean hurrry up" when told we were shr rolled her eyes and said not fast enough. Just some advice if you have an attitude problem when you have to do your job then something involving customers is not for you. Gas is cheaper but not worth her attitude. Mbled under breath as we left to not come back then Said we were "B" myself and my 5 and 10 yr old DAUGHTERS. Disgusting person!

This site is my first choice place.  Of all restaurants I know I favor it most. I never miss an opportunity to go to that place. when  I want to go to a delicious lunch, this place comes first to my mind. good and varied  food and a rich menu.professional staff, and nice ambience. Also, the bill is fair. I praise this place with pleasure.<//text>

I posted a previous bad review I'm now correcting. I won't rehash the issue of earlier. I will say management was extremely good about resolving it properly and even offered me a free breakfast I declined by choice. Problem was actually someone contracting to them not actually works for them. I appreciate their great attitude and outstanding customer service to resolve so never happens again. I would give them a 5th star if had a better store selection but you can't have everything.  Lol</Review>

Nice little casino & c store inside, with a grill, which sadly closes kind of early

I was able to put in an order; I had the bacon blue burger, made by Johnny, which was one of the best burgers I've ever had in my life

Not much selection along 395; this is already a decent spot, and I was informed this evening they are going to be expanding both the truck stop, and casino<//review>< Pictures>

<Review>I ordered chicken strips at the casino/gas station and they gave me a hamburger instead. When I politely let the waiter know the chef came out and said to me "I already made the hamburger, just eat it" and stormed off. The waiter came to me right after and apologized for the chef's behavior and later got me the chicken strips. I then had diarrhea the rest of the day. Don't come here if you don't plan on riding the Diarrhea Express on a one way trip to Liquid Poop Lava Town.</Review><pics>None</pics><Response>None< /Response><Gmap_id>0x80bfbec073f27399:0xf830c364bad46da1<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Card readers on the gas pumps. Had fraud activity after using a credit card in the pump card slot. Called the station to alert them, and the chick got a little rude. That made me feel they are in on it. Such a shock given the ownership of the property.</text>

By far the best place to get gas on the road from SoCal to the Sierras. Gas is inexpensive, pumps are not crowded, and there is open land away from the road for our Rhodie to stretch his legs. The restaurant has decent food but orders can take a while so it helps to call ahead from the road to order food.< /Review>

<Pictures>None</Pictures><review>Place was clean and large.  And there's a real food counter.
Definitely draws a crowd of both locals and drivers.  But... scary white-"rights", Nazi guys in there BOTH times Ive been in there in the last year.

Both times they were in a group, I think they had just gotten off work; 3 young men doing some kind of construction 1st visit, and the other 2 young men might have just been truckers who drive together.  Anyways, all of them were showcasing some creepy misogynistic violence message on their shirts.  Both groups had at least one guy with the tell-tale red Trump hat.  The other guys were just scary with creepy violent shirts.  One guy had a "white lives matter too" shirt.  And they all had that creepy you're white too grin, "so we might take u as a wife after the rape.
Its weird because the place has a folksy native american reservation feel, with all their Mexican blankets, casino, and I believe the kind of fresh fruits and local dried treats that suggest reservation community.  So if its on a reservation, why does it attract people who dont like dark skinned people?  I guess its the only place to go.  Its good they're all sticking it out together, and hopefully chumming it up.
There didnt seem to be a meth vibe (apart from it being a desert truck stop).  And it didnt seem like a sex-slave trade point either.</review>< Rate>

<review>I don't recommend any travel plaza or truck stop they are over priced and they rape the truck drivers that stop there the same trucker drivers who's backs carry there supplies to and fro without whom nothing will move they risk there very lives to bring them there supplies and what ever else they want delivered to them. The fuel is the only reason I stop there now.<//review>< rate>

Cheapest gas around!!!! It's on Indian land so they have a little casino and the tax advantage on gas prices. Clean facilities also.<//Review>

<rate>5<//rate><text>Financing was easy, customer service was great! I went in picked out a system for my girlfriends Nissan Sentra, and was asked, asked! If I would like to come in the following morning for an install! I was like hell yeah! Thought I'd need an appointment for a week or three out! Nope next day! Install went great, had one little problem with a panel next to the windshield though. It kept popping open. Called the shop the next day and they said to bring it by. Drove in waited for an hour for the tech to get to it but when he did he was able to fix it in less than 10 minutes. I was very ok with that. No problems since!</text><Time>1625172692127<//Time></record>

Last weekend I had a great experience at No limit Sound & Auto Glass, Ernesto helped me with my Kia optima led fog lights.
I STRONGLY RECOMMEND THIS PLACE.
Very honest and communicative.
Don't waste your time and money, come here if you care about your car.< /Review>

If you are looking for over all EXCELENCE then look no further! Ernie the owner is wonderful. I highly recommend everyone to come here for window tint for sure! He did my last car bout 10 yrs ago and its still standing strong! So of course I trust him to do my tint for my new car. I even paid before the work was done 5 days in advance, this is how confident I am in a job well done! As usual he delivered the BEST results! His prices are honest and reasonable. His customer service is beyond exceptional! He also replaced my windshield for me on this car. Definitely aims for perfection and shows in his work. Love my tint, love my windshield! I will NEVER go anywhere else. I will remain a LIFE LONG customer! Thank you again for everything Ernie! God bless-</Review>

<Rating>5</Rating><text>This place really impressed me enough to write a review on them. Of all the places I called around town, they seemed to be the only ones who sounded like they "wanted" the business over the phone. Very professional. Once I got there, I was sold what I needed and the sales guy was honest about what the best product was for me (he didn't try to persuade me to spend more money than I needed to). They installed it on the spot and were done quickly. The product installation was flawless. I strongly recommend these guys. It's rare to find such a professional and courteous business in this town, but these guys are the real deal. Also I was able to used their WIFI while work was done..</text>< Pics>

<Text>Great and friendly service from very knowledgeable staff! After a long road trip my after-market cd player stopped working and was displaying an error code. I stopped in and as soon as I told the staff what was wrong, they immediately knew what kind of CD player I had and how to fix it. Luckily for me, it was a simple reset; less than 5 minutes and I was on my way. They didn’t even charge me, which was very nice and sincerely appreciated; I will definitely be back! Thank guys for the hospitality.< /Text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

No limit sounds has been taking care of my family for years!! They do it all. We've done sound systems,  window tints, lights, car alarm, and audio wiring. Highly recommend them. Great service no doubt! They will take care of you no matter what.</text>

<Review>If your looking to pay 100$ for 15 minutes of troubleshooting. To find out it only took a couple squirts of WD-40 on door hinges to get rid of a dome door ajar light, that could have been done by yourself . Make things worse to be bragging that he overcharged customers for having luxury or expensive car for twice as long. Save your money and go somewhere else, especially if you care about your car.</Review>< Pictures>

<text>So I literally just got off the phone with this place and it is by far the worst experience I have ever had. I already have speakers for my truck, sorry my friend gave them to me, and was calling to buy some adapters and speaker cables. The guy who answers the phone is not capable of answering questions so I was told to hold on for another guy. After explaining what I was after the guy says "where did you get your speakers?" I said "from my friend." He follows with "call your friend man, I'm not a tech support business." Maybe someone went to the bathroom in his cereal this morning, however, that is no excuse. I have worked in retail for 10+ years now and would never treat a potential customer that way. these guys are apparently only willing to help if you are spending tons of money with them or only buying from them. the funny thing is I have quite a few people I work with looking at stereo options for their cars right now and this guy may have just lost his owner thousands of dollars in business because of his bad attitude. Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else.<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Name>

Today I came to NO LIMIT on April 24 2014 to have a Pioneer stereo with back up camera and Rockford Fosgate stereo system installed Viper alarm with engine start and have my windows tinted Ernie the owner gave me a quote and he beat every other shops price in the Moreno Valley area he sought the job through from beginning to end the stereo system sound better than any other that I have had in many other cars that I have owned in the past and my truck looks great as well in the past I have brought him my Honda accord and Mercedes Benz this is the only shop in the Inland empire that I would recommend Big thanks to the owner Ernie and the NO LIMIT installers.< /review>

Battery was being drained didn't know why and it was getting worse,had to get a jump everytime I turned off engine. My main mechanic was going to charge me $100 for diagnosis another audio place was $65. Owner looked at it himself found issue in 10 minutes $27 part and only $40 to look at it. Was only gonna charge me $60 gave him $70..HONEST HONEST HONEST!!!!!!</review>

<review>If you care about your car, do not go here.  I went to install tint on my car and had to return two other times, and they still didn't get it right.  Owner said that bubbles happen and there is nothing you can do about it.  I had 3 other cars tinted and never had bubbles, I thought that shops just all did the same good job, but obviously I was wrong.  I told him that the window was not cleaned right before having installed the tint and he just ignored that and worked on the obvious half inch bubbles.  I will never go back to this place for anything...<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

Have been coming here for more than a year, very clean, helpful staff, probably all destinations are available. There is a lounge and nice atmosphere. Will be a bit complex , but people don’t save effort to help. Best choice for traveling all around<//Review>

Map always takes to the west side and people get confused. It's better to tell the driver that you are at the east side.  Coming inside the Union Station to catch the uber is actually easy. All you have to follow is the arrow. However my recommendation will be go outside to Vignes and Cesar Chavez and then open the app to place the order. It's faster.</Review>< UserId.>

Why do they say they have monthly parking rates when you can't get it? Lady at the booth was surprised I wanted to put my name on the list. Almost like she knew there's no way to get one. Pretty unprofessional as well. She just took my name and phone number on a sticky note. I'm sure it just ended up in the trash can. Otherwise the parking is secure clean and convenient. Just a bummer about the monthly. I guess if they can force you into paying more, then they make more?<//Text>

Great place to park if you are going to Grand Park! Also their lot is huge, with security, so super safe. We parked here on July 4th and took the train just one stop to Grand park for the fireworks show...super cool, nearly right above our heads!< /text>

Great secure parking. Almost always there are empty seats, the price is average, as it seems to me< /Text>

<date>1569086983294< /date><Rate>3< /Rate><Text>Union Station in LA is fine, with enough fast-food restaurants to provide a filling meal. The signage is really inadequate. You have to ask one of the employees where to go just to get around. You can get a pick up at Union Station East, but there is no signage to tell you how to get dropped off there, and it is complicated. Also, some of the Metro lines have construction going on, but the Information counters don't know about it. You can get some bad info and then find out by trial and error, after walking long corridors.<//Text>< Pics>

<Review>Using public transportation Metrolink etc is an amazing experience. I went from downtown Los Angeles to CSU Fullerton in 1 hour. What's amazing about my travel statement. Is the fact that it actually takes 2 hours driving your own vehicle. The same distance.<//Review>< Pictures>

After using Union Station East for over 15 years, we quit due to the fact that it has taken ~30 min to get picked up after our return flight for the last three trips. After watching 2-3 vans go by for both of the competitor companies, we knew we needed to shop elsewhere.<//text>

Functional historic train station that has barely adequate safety. Not a place for long layovers. You may have to walk a long way to get to the train platform. Fairly good subway and bus connections but you will have to wait outside for any bus, with some bus stops across the street. Seems less safe after dark. Food options expensive among poor variety.<//Text>

<Review>(Translated by Google) Beautiful place ... Part of the history of California and of all the USA ... It's nice to go through it ... I did not like that business did not change a $ 5 bill if I did not buy something ... It's a tourist spot and people must be cared for by courtesy and education ...

Hermoso lugar ... Parte de la historia de California y de todos los EEUU ... Es agradable recorrerlo ... No me gustó que los negocios no me cambiaran un billete de 5 dólares si no compraba algo ... Es un punto turístico y se debe atender a la gente por cortesía y educación ...<//Review>< Pictures>

I have been going to this auto part store for at least 10 years. This last time in really changed my mind about shopping here and disappointed me. I walked in searching for what I needed. Obviously confused on where to look. There where literally 6 associates at the front. 3 of them walked by me and did not greet me or offer assistance in helping me find what I was looking for. Though they eyed me like I was shoplifting. Quality of staff has truly dropped.

I was ready leave and hitting the door when an older gentlemen came from the back an offered to help me. Turns out the product I was looking for was behind the register. Had any of the other 5 people just asked what I was looking for I could have saved 10 minutes of walking back and forth.

To put salt in the wound; the item that the online system said they had was not in stock. Which means someone is not updating inventory correctly. I highly doubt I will return here. Prices have gotten outrageous anyway.< /review>

< Review>
Went in yesterday and they had a line very clearly made on the ground pointing you in the direction for waiting in line with 6ft marker spacings, masks are required to go in but for some reason the cashier had no mask and the manager did but he didn't care. I was waiting in that line along with another person and after he was done checking someone out i should have been next but instead he decided to help out 2 new individual people that walked in and one didn't even have a mask so i dropped my items on their counter and walked out. I've been to that store often and i can say i've never been impressed with their customer service but that was just plain ignorance by the cashier and manager. O'Reillys across the street has 10x better customer service.< /Review>

This place is very useful to me because it's down the street apart from that the workers here have the sense of every customer that walks into the door is a thief which is not a good representation of this company also their attitudes are extremely poor which is not good for business sometimes they have the habit of trying to size you up which is funny because this is a auto parts store, and.. that's it.. nothing more!! it's Under New Management which is understandable manager needs to have a group meeting amongst his peers to work on customer service< /text>

I was recently in autozone buying a pulley when I seen the manager Maurice yelling at his employee that was helping a customer it was very rude. And when I had to go to his line to pay in cash he was very irritated and did not want to help me. It was uncalled for to tell at your employee's in front of customers.</Text>

really nice people at this store, and knowledgeable; ready and willing to discuss your automotive issues with you.  i brought in an ignition condenser today for testing that i bought 3 months ago.  they couldn't test it, but replaced it anyway, even though it didn't have a warranty and i didn't have a receipt.  it was bad because the old chevy ran perfectly with the new one they gave me.  i used to go mainly to kragen/o'reilly, but mack road autozone is my new go-to store.</Text>

This place used to be a madhouse! People complain about the wait times now...you should have seen it back in the early 2000s - you don't know what a "wait time" is. The funny thing is I know much about this place because I've been on both sides of those windows before. I worked there for a few years as a temp. and I've also had to swallow my pride and look for work there. The Staff are all awesome, some of my best work memories of all time were made there - in fact that's where I met a boyfriend of 10 years- we met by flirting through the mail slots in the upstairs mailroom. Haha!  Ahem, back to where I was. So the staff...lol..they can tend to be not so friendly if you don't approach them with a smile or some type of courteous gesture. You can't blame them though having to push back all that negativity they receive on a daily basis - but they have never been rude to me - always helpful. It's a busy branch, but convenient if you find yourself in a rut. Which, we've all been there - and if you haven't been there, I pray that you never will!<//review>

Exactly what you would expect from the Sacramento County Department of Human Assistance.  Unless you have an appointment (if you do come at least 15 minute early) the wait will be long and crowded.  The good news is there is no shortage of characters to people watch while you wait.  Once you are called things move quickly and the workers are kind and will walk you through the entire process from start to finish.  Its not necessarily a life goal to end up here, but be thankful this place exists for those hard times.  Everyone has damage and you have to give credit where it is due; the people who work here will help you to get out of that rough patch and back on your feet.  Unless you haven't any intention of getting out of it and think these services are a free ride.  To which you are mistaken.  Use this tool for what it is intended and you couldn't be dissatisfied.  Abuse it or take advantage of it and you will never think it enough.  Your choice.  Have a great day.</review></record>

Would rate 0/5 if possible. Staff is incredibly rude and its impossible to get in contact with anybody there no matter how long you are willing to wait. For example,Ive been waiting to reach staff for over 3 and a half hours again today to simply inquire about my food stamp application when I was told It'd be a 10min wait. I tried calling a week before this and the same thing happened back then. They could care less if you are homeless,unemployed,and malnourished..</Review>

It should be like a Dr. office to make appointments phone or a video appointment. You can go shopping with mask on and they have a plastic surround cashiers them. Why can't DHS do the same?

It takes such a long time to get any sort of benefits from the County. Like... 3 hours. While it is relatively clean, the attitudes of the employees are nasty. Its like they don't even want you there. Hell, even got SacPD lining the booths around the rooms. What gets me is the fact that most of them disappear around 12pm rather than have rotating shifts or somebody to man the desks while others are out. I give it 3 starts because eventually the process by AI gets done. But it shouldn't take so long.</review>

Which may have bothered others but I hadn't planned anything for the morning because I knew where I was going.. So I just let her learn as much as she could . Hey it can only benefit  ALL of us later.. Right??  Everything went well and she was very informative.</Text>< name>

However, the case workers have always been polite and on my side, once I got to see them. They're obviously ridiculously overworked and understaffed, but they do their best.

Whatever you do, don't be even a MINUTE late for your scheduled appointment time (where you just hand in a paper saying you're there). You WILL have to come back. They have a strict schedule for checking in, though they can take their time calling you to see a worker. And whatever you do, DON'T LEAVE. They'll call your name a few times, but if you're not there they have to move on to the next person, so you may end up spending another day there. And be sure to already be signed up with CalJOBS before you see them. All of this will help make the process smoother for you.</Text>< pics>

If you need to get the majority of your "to do" list done regarding Medi-Cal,Cash-Aid, and Cal Fresh (food stamps), this is definitely the office you want to go to. If you have an appointment, show up on time or you will have to come back another day (not fun!). Also, there are a lot of interesting people who loiter outside, so LOCK YOUR DOORS.<//review>

These people are 5-Star all the way!

Don't listen to the negative reviews posted by rude, impatient, UNGRATEFUL people. This place GIVES AWAY tax payer money to people who in many cases do NOT deserve to be handed free money.

Did you read the one about the lady who complained because she waited for 6 hours. You'd think she'd have the common sense to leave and go get a dam job but NOPE! She wants her free money lol</Review>

Don't let the fact that it is "assistance" make you forget the State of California says you are entitled to whatever benefit you are, period. Don't let the fact that dealing with DHA and DMV etc. always sucks be a reason to put up with more rude treatment. But also, don't expect Ritz Carlton service where none is coming, and remember the rules are the rules, don't get mad. At the end of the day, this place gets the highest rating a government entity can in my book -- a solid 3.<//review>

I arrived for my appointment a half an hour early, and still had to wait over two hours. Nobody here is helpful at all, the place is inundated with just the worst kind of people. You will be sitting around for 4 hours so you can stop starving, and the entire time you will be watching an endless parade of obvious crackheads, tweekers and hooligans picking up their drug money. Then you will finally be called to your window, and asked to come back another day</review>

Super friendly and great prices! Love that the lady there also took the time to teach me a little about the wear and tear on tires and what to look for when I purchase tires in the future. Will definitely continue to go back.< /Review>

This is my go to tire shop. Today I needed my brakes change immediately. I am taking a trip to Long Beach didn’t want drive on bad brakes. Went down the street and they wanted to triple charge. The amount was insane. I drove praying for luck on my budget. And I saw Nan’s sign for brakes. I didn’t even know they offer brakes and I’ve been going here for my tires ! They did such an amazing job. My car is driving so smooth. They were kind, helpful and professional. Gave me the best deal. I’m grateful for shops like this in the community. The best part was they were quick and efficient! I highly recommend everyone to go here for your tires and brakes needs!</review>

When I was there, Broke my TPMS. Didn't get a credit or no offer to fix. The guy had trouble mounting a tire to the rim. Wouldn't recommend for decent service. Worst exp I've had at a tire shop.</text>

< Review>
Very helpful workers, the owner might seem mean at firsr but is actually quite nice and she actually seems to work despite her age! Sometimes the tires might seem a bit overly chargued by 5 or 10 bucks, but that seems to be for getting a complete ser of tires, meaming same brand and same thread. They might seem a bit mean when its packed but its because of how they are trying to focus on their work to have more space available.<//Review>

<Time>1542143495532</Time><Review>Rude. Pressured me into buying a "matching set" of 4 tires and they didn't even all match. Front passenger side went flat within 2 months of use due to it not being properly handled. There were showing wires on 2 of the 4 I bought. Would not reccomend unless you want to waste money and  buy new tires right after.<//Review>< pics>

<pictures>None< /pictures><review>This place is a must visit if you are in the neighborhood (and maybe worth a separate trip if you are not)- both the baked goods and the coffee are top notch quality and delicious. Not only that, it’s the kind of place that simply deserves success- these are hard working people who greet you with a smile and really seem to take pride in delivering a feel good experience from the coffee to the food to the service. I only recently discovered this place and will be back many times.<//review>< Time>

<text>Great pastry shop with a wide selection of both sweet and savory pastries, and fast, friendly service. They are really good with presentations, everything looks so yummy! But honestly I wouldn’t wait in line especially if the line is long as it often is on the weekend. I’ve tried the following items so far:

- Ham and Cheese Croissant: hot and delicious gruyere and ham in a flaky poppy seed croissant. Loved it. But if I can give some feedback, I feel that the ham slices could have been more separate to invite the cheese to come in between.

- Savory Scone: a bit small but the flavor and texture are amazing. It got the intensity of green onion, the crunchiness of nuts, while maintaining the heartwarmingly rich scone taste.

- Everything Croissant: I guess this is inspired by everything bagel? Sesame covered croissant with a thin layer of cream cheese and green onions, a perfect match for the savory flavor, glad that I gave it a try.< /text>< pics>

You'll initially come for the famous stuffed croissants but you'll return for the beautiful other pastries like the seasonal almond bostock, the savory scones, and other delicious items like a curry potato puff.

You can never go wrong here!<//review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNVzEkn37Z_-Ndt68LZmh63jnnz3HwVHCyNhhV2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

<Text>Neighbor bakehouse deserves 5 and a half stars. If you come here early and get a warm loaf of bread, you will likely be in a good mood for the rest of the day. Makes you think how little you need to be happy: fresh, good bread made by artisans. Their pastries are great too. The only downside is it's a bit pricey, but SF prices :/

I keep killing my sourdough starter, but the team has been generous enough to keep giving me more.< /Text>< pictures>

<text>I wouldn’t want Neighbor to be my neighbor, because that’s a guarantee that I’ll end up on My 600-Lb Life.

Excellent viennoisserie (croissant types) with lots of unique sweet and savory offerings.

I tried the following, which were all great:
-pistachio blackberry twice baked croissant
-choco-hazelnut twice baked croissant
-butter croissant
-mushroom green onion tart

Wish they baked throughout the day instead of super early in the morning. I arrived around 10AM and all the croissants were cold :( the mushroom tart would’ve been amaaaazing hot< /text>< response>

Popular pastries sometimes sell out.

<text>Kimchi toast is to die for. Also, potato and spinach filled pastries are clutch!!! 10/10 would eat everything on their menu. Well worth the 30 minute wait in the socially distant line. If you order ahead they let you skip the long line. They are all using ppe at their pick up booth and I felt very safe. Another note, their drip coffee was surprisingly good! No outdoor seating anymore. You can sit on a bench one building down next to barbershop.< /text>< Pictures>

Exceptional pastries, great selection and unique flavors. Get the double baked ones and the ham and cheese morning bun, delicious.
No inside space to sit, great for sunny days, plenty in Dogpatch.< /Text>

I found the perfect croissant i was looking for here. Other pastries looked amazing too. The people who work there are super friendly and are passionate about the pastries.</review>

The regular black coffee here is one of my favorites in the city at that price point. To get excellent fresh coffee and pastry for their prices in SF is no small feet.

I’d always get coffee and a Ginger Pull-Apart to go, and sit in the local park. If you’re looking for European style pastry with a SF twist, look no further.</review>< Pictures>

<review>Nice, friendly bakery, but pastries were a bit hit and miss.

The chocolate claw was just ok, the passion fruit dough ball was good, and the ginger pull apart was really good! Chocolate chip cookie was disappointing - it looked a lot better than it was. But the staff were jolly and friendly, and everything seemed fresh.

Only had outdoor seating, which was a bit of an issue as we went on a bit of a gloomy, wet day.

I'd go back if I was in the area, but probably wouldn't go out of my way for it.</review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMlx15TnBC5N55_797F9KFOz3qZKi9jEPMUxx_C=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO734nSuYsSrEZLWFiQn9sNn0SShPkTrkZ7HEU7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOHwjLAPJiuJuK3ZxTx2QHEIarx59w5QvrER60k=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPLV2ZQ-3B3hQ6jvfGcyAsF7mC9iB2gBBpr6v8l=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures><response>None< /response>< GmapID>

This is an amazing bakery and almost always busy in the morning with a line out the door.  The service goes pretty quickly and the pastries are top notch.  If you like croissants, rolls, cookies and other bakery things, they have great stuff that even the best connoisseur will enjoy.< /Review>

Best croissant in the city. Everything they make is awesome, my favorite bakery by far. I'm always looking for an excuse to go down to the dog patch and get my croissant fix. Two for one if I can time it right and also get some ice cream from Mr. And Mrs. Misc.</text>

<Review>Hands down the best bakery in the city. Since pandemic be sure to check their opening hours and I suggest to preorder for reducing wait time.

The staff is super friendly, even though they have more work for less people then usual (maybe because of SF city restrictions), so be kind to them.

The pastries are stellar, the sourdough bread turns even sourdough opposers for fans!<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None<//Response><gmapID>0x808f7fb9ba7b10c3:0xa0b0948519a000d<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<review>Awesome pastries but they have to improve their service. Huge line outside  the crawls VERY slowly... and when its finally your turn they are just unfriendly and impatient...
Places like that should create an experience... there are many good pastries in the city and service is a big part of that experience...<//review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

Go here. And when you think you’ve eaten something so good that it can’t be topped, go back here and try something else that will probably be even more delicious. Everything they make is creative and perfectly sweet or salty. The mushroom tart is a veggie dream as is the everything croissant. The ham and cheese morning bun is flaky, buttery, meat and cheese heaven. Their coffee is really great too. Their hours can be limiting if you don’t work or live in the area but it’s worth a detour any day of the week (that they’re open).</review>

Super flaky buttery pastries. Unique ingredients bake into wholesome goodness.  Never knew sauerkraut, cheddar and croissant go so well together.  Great customer service, but lines get long after 9am, get there early if you don't want to wait.< /text>

<review>Little pricey (like all of SF) but oh my gosh just thinking about the pastries at this place makes my mouth water. Go for the croissant variants and you will not be disappointed. Blackberry pistachio and raspberry hazelnut twice bakeds have been my favourite so far! Literally love at first bite. The sourdough is pretty amazing too, hardy on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside. Was not a fan of the German coffee cake though--a little too dry for my taste. Haven't tried any savory stuff cuz I prefer my bread sweet, but I'd love to try sometime!< /review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMSd3Vyr0uRlEMsEVnY6oHaeseaNxkwWv12w-oz=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics><Resp>None< /Resp><Gmap_id>0x808f7fb9ba7b10c3:0xa0b0948519a000d<//Gmap_id></record>

Best bakery in the city, seriously!

I went on a mission to try all the bakeries on SF Eater's Top Bakery List and this was beyond the best one. You can't go wrong with the Ginger Pull-Apart or the Mushroom Tart. They recently added a Bread Pudding to the menu and it is AMAZING (better to eat there).

Yes the line is long, but if you get there before 830/9am there is little to no line and it goes really fast. Also, generally, the seating area has regular turn-over so you can usually find a place to sit for 2-4 people.< /review>

No one would disagree that neighbor is one of the top 3 bakeries in SF, and many would say #1. Everything is delicious, and while I like the chocolate almond croissant from arsicault more, neighbor bakehouse wins hands down on variety and creativity. I would personally also rank it above Tartine!<//review>

Love it. All of it. Their pastries are some (if not THE) best in the city. I’m a fan. Their twice baked croissants, ginger pull, and mushroom savory pastry are my personal faves. Parking is a bit difficult, with limited spots out in front, and tons of people heading to the nearby brunch spots. But if you drive around to the backside, there is more packing available. Happy eating!<//Text>

The best bakery in SF. I didn't like sourdough bread until I tasted it made by them. Totally recommend the olive bread and you'll never want anything else again! Their pastries are also delicious and in my top you'll find their passion fruit pastry, the croissant and also the mushroom tart.
Service is also very good!

Easily one of the best bakeries in the city for pastries. Although they have both and both are good. Compared to Tartine, neighbor has much better pastries and only slightly less flavorful bread. A constant local haunt and the double baked raspberry croissant is to die for.</review>

The cinnamon almond bostock and the ginger pull apart were both good. Neither was mind blowing but we enjoyed them. My wife's chai latte was good after she added a bit of syrup to it.< /Text>

<Text>This place was fantastic! I wish I could have tried more. Everything I got was delicious, especially the everything croissant and the guava pastry. The savory porridge was particularly inventive and excellent too. Prices were a bit high so it's probably best for your wallet and your health if you just go for an occasional treat.<//Text><Date>1549221544824< /Date></record>

The raspberry-hazelnut and sauerkraut croissant were very unique and tasted great. So was the coffee and regular and everything croissants. Extra points for opening as early as they do. We were jet lagged and wanted to get in and out of the city as early as possible. The staff were also lovely - no attitude issues that could be expected of a cult favorite bakery like this one.<//text>

<review>Delicious, friendly, and awesome! We got an apple pie, chocolate croissant, ham and cheese roll, and this delicious almond bread that I can't remember the proper name of. Everything was excellent and the staff was super friendly. I would definitely recommend stopping by if you're in the area!!<//review></record>

The bakery is in a very unassuming spot, not surrounded by much else, but it is worth the visit. An expanded selection of sweet and savory pastries and free refills on drip coffee make for a filling breakfast. Seating is only available outside and it is uncovered however, so dress warm or get pastries for takeaway if the weather is poor.<//Text>

Came in before noon on a lazy Sunday before Xmas, the line was not too long, the employees were professional and friendly.  There are many great pastries here but I came in today for a ciabatta bun.  It was a great accompaniment to a salad I was making for lunch.  It had a crisp exterior but a soft and doughy interior.  I have tried other things here before and they have all been perfection.  A must try if in the neighborhood!<//review>

<text>Had their everything croissant,  which was really buttery and fresh. I felt there could be more ingredients for the price but this is one bakery worth paying for in terms of quality given for the pastries. There is a moderately long line even in the morning (was there at about 8am) but the queue moves pretty quickly unless someone in front of you places a large order. Place is small and seating is limited so be prepared to do a take away instead!

Seating is outdoor only.<//text>< date>

Mixed feelings. Some of their stuff is truly great, but I've had a fair amount of disappointing items as well. The trick is to go for the sweet stuff – pistachio blackberry twice-baked, chocolate claw, etc. – because as you make your way down through the butter croissant (very good, but not amazing) towards the savory part of the menu, the quality drops dramatically.
Add to that a few other drawbacks – long lines, early and limited hours, and a less-than-inspiring surrounding neighborhood – and you get a bakery that has a lot of potential, but doesn't quite live up to the hype.</text>

This is an okay bakery; no more, no less. Their sweet goods are on American side, which can be good or bad depending on what you prefer. I'm a fan of classic French pastries and find most of local stuff way to sweet.
Wait can be overwhelming on weekends, which makes sense as this is one of very few bakeries in the neighborhood.< /Review>

<Text>Delicious! Even though it's always pretty busy the staff isn't rushed and are always great about answering questions. I love the chocolate claw! They also have various types of bread always coming out so try some of the seasonal bread and treats. It also pays to go earlier to make sure they have everything.< /Text>< user_id>

Everything looks amazing! I tried the pistachio and blackberry twice-baked croissant ($4.50) which was absolutely delicious. The line goes out the door, but goes by reasonably quickly. There is seating outside. I'm hoping to come back again soon! It will be tempting to buy a whole box full of pastries to take home :)<//review>

Attention to detail, good and creative variety of pastries. Coffee is 4/5. Often very crowded so if you don't go early expect them to be out of things. Overall the quality far exceeds anything you'd get out of a chain and I'm happy this is part of the dogpatch neighborhood.</review>

<Review>This place seems over-hyped, but it's worth coming here. The line usually looks long, but it goes by quickly (usually only a 10 minute wait at most). I come here all the time after climbing and I love their pastries. The staff is also super friendly. They do have some meal-like options, but that's not what the place is known for. Although the dough bun is popular, my favorites are the almond bostock or the raspberry or blackberry turnovers.</Review>< Gmap_id>

This place gives me a moral dilemna: the first few bites are insanely good but then as you continue eating it the overwhelming oil and butter packed into the twice-baked croissant starts piling in. Soon enough, you're in a food coma because you can't seem to stop eating it because it tastes so good but your stomach is starting to get more upset.

🤣 I still consider this place one of my favorites. Maybe bring a friend to help with self-control so you don't finish an entire twice-baked croissant and regret it. 😜< /Text>

Possibly the best bakery in SF. the passion fruit macaroon was phenomenal, and the chocolate pudding filled donut was unbelievable. The line was longer than expected, but the staff moved us through pretty quick. Definitely going back soon.<//text>

Arrive early!  At 1 pm they had sold out of many of their daily items!  Meat pizza slice was thick, cheesy and so good.  Butter crossiants are Devine.  Will return much earlier in the day!  A fine bakery!</text>

Love the pastries here! The croissant is crispy on the outside and soft and fluffy on the inside - this is as close as it comes to Paris in SF! Since this bakery is in my neighborhood, I have tried almost every pastry here. I like the savory ones - mushroom tart and everything croissant - more than the plain/sweet ones, but honestly, everything here is delicious!</text>

Go on an off day and avoid the crowds. It recently got popular even though there's tons of outdoor seating.

The pastries are amazingly crispy! Try everything</Text>

Probably my favorite bakery in San Francisco; everything there is delicious and wholesome, from pastries to their cold brew coffee. The Croque Madame and Chocolate Pudding Bun deserve special mention; everything is fantastic, but they're in a league of their own. The staff is super friendly, but I'll be honest: they could all be huge jerks and I'd still go here (it's that good).</Text>

I've read the reviews...blown away by the scrumptious descriptions....salivating...and DogPatch - once the ghetto- is so far...
So, the Tat guy in the chair at the salon, was raving about the high octane delicious pastries.I listened. I plotted, planned and drove the heck over there for some of the very best yummiest calories I have ever enjoyed.
Pull Apart - pull at my heart!
I shall return<//review>

<UserId.>103379264202553362035<//UserId.><review>Neighbor Bakehouse started as a popup in the Mr & Mrs space for about a year, eventually shutting down, much to my dismay. So, imagine my excitement when I heard they were actually getting a full brick and mortar shop!

I've been here more times than I'd like to admit since then, so, rather than boring you all with drab particulars about all their pastries, I'll just say this: everything is delicious, but they definitely excel in their savory pastries more than their sweet ones. The croissants are must-haves, and, for those with a sweet tooth, definitely grab one of the passion fruit custard filled pastries! I've seen these come in two different forms so far, but both have been delicious.

Get there before 11am and they should still have most things available. And either buy to go, or be prepared to stand around, as the limited outdoor seating does tend to be full.

***Accessibility Info***

Venue - The shop itself is just a little front area you walk in to and order from, so accessibility isn't really an issue. The seating outside is somewhat accessible: if you want to scoot in under the table, you'll have to move the benches first.

Bathroom - Didn't try them, but I'm not sure they have a public one.</review><pics>None< /pics>< rate>

Neighbor Bakehouse is in the top 4 best pastry shops in the Bay Area in my opinion. Tartine, b.patisserie and Manresa Bread are the other three which I all give a tie. I live in San Mateo but drive to there shop on the weekends because it's that good. Parking is easy'ish and they open at 6:30 am which is perfect for early risers. I love that I can go there and back so quickly. Other shops have long lines, parking issues for people who have to drive there and open later which makes it a challenge. I seek out great pastry and bread and NB is crushing it. It's an honor to have access to their delishishness.</review>

Maybe the best pastries I've ever had. Very unique flavors and ingredients, both sweet and savory. Of everything we ordered, my favorite was the bostock. I think I could eat that for breakfast every day for the rest of my life...< /Review>

- Heavenly European bakery
- Attentive and super helpful service
- Amazing pastries. Hard to pick a favourite. Try a different one each time. Not super sweet.< /review>

<Text>Neighbor Bakehouse is in the top 4 best pastry shops in the Bay Area in my opinion. Tartine, b.patisserie and Manresa Bread are the other three which I all give a tie. I live in San Mateo but drive to there shop on the weekends because it's that good. Parking is easy'ish and they open at 6:30 am which is perfect for early risers. I love that I can go there and back so quickly. Other shops have long lines, parking issues for people who have to drive there and open later which makes it a challenge. I seek out great pastry and bread and NB is crushing it. It's an honor to have access to their delishishness.< /Text><user_name>David Dolnick<//user_name>< Rating>

5 stars for presentation, 3 stars for taste, 3 stars for texture, 3.5 stars for quality of the ingredients, 2 stars for value, 3 stars as a place to work or hangout.</review>< Pics>

Awesome bakery in Potrero. The quality of the baked goods is super high and the diversity of selection is amazing. The Chocolate Pudding Doughp is awesome and the savory croissants (like the smoked fish) were delicious, too. Also, there are free refills on coffee here! So if you buy a cup of coffee, they will top you off before you head back out<//Text>

< review>
Was told off by the curly haired female staff with glasses for taking photos. Oh wait, there’s no sign anywhere that says no photos. And it’s a place that serves food and even though people have mixed opinions on whether one should take photos of food, many do it, so it’s more or less “normal” these days? Was she worried about potential competitors trying to spy on them? Oh actually, Neighbor’s own instagram has photos and videos of their baked goods and their kitchen 🤷🏻‍♀️ I wasn’t blocking traffic either because it was a Wednesday at 7:20am and we were the only people inside - so what is it? I have tried most of their stuff and everything is mediocre (subjective statement of course - evacuated based on my preferences) except for the raspberry hazelnut croissant (and second place: pistachio blackberry croissant). Those are so good. Most negative reviews on google and yelp are about their customer service. It’s true that the customer service has never been overwhelmingly positive but it was never much of a problem because it was never technically bad - their staff are just like every waiter in France who doesn’t work for tips - kind of condescending and/or not giving a damn but still overall reasonably efficient. The curly haired woman with glasses though - I saw a yelp reviewer who was said to frequent the place weekly and wrote that the service is bad  but she was especially bad and needed an attitude check 🤷🏻‍♀️🤤 not working for tip is not inherently an excuse to be rude though - servers in Australia don’t work on tip but the majority of them are super friendly. I’ll just go to Bluestone lane coffee shop in the city that serves their raspberry hazelnut croissant in the future (and much better coffee). And if I reeeeaaally want the pistachio hazelnut for a change, I’ll call ahead and make sure she’s not working 😬🧐< /review>

They have the best croissants in the city, and their other pastries are very good. Don't leave without trying the plain butter croissant, though.</review>

Neighbor is still a bit of a hidden gem floating under the radar of Tartine-focused tourists and enthusiasts. Fantastic pastry dough leads to a slew of savory and sweet options, and the bread is wonderful on its own or turned into a sandwich, bread pudding, or - my favorite - bostock.< /review>

Very rude/unreasonable cashier complained to me that I was being "wasteful" when I requested a box for the 6 pastries I enthusiastically wanted to bring home. "You don't want to carry these out?", "I'll do it, but we try not be be wasteful here", "Next time, you should remember to plan ahead". He was very admonishing to the point where other staff members tried to intervene.  Most confusing interaction I've ever had as a patron especially I was with out of town guests doing a bakery tour that weekend  (Ariscault, Tartine, Bouchon).  Great pastries, but a very embarrassing experience.</text>

Basically the BEST bakery on earth - I don't even write Yelp reviews anymore but felt compelled as I sink my teeth into the Croque Madame I ordered this morning.  Whenever I come visit my family in the Bay Area I make a special trip out to basically order one of everything at Neighbor Bakehouse.  Been here a few times and I'm obsessed with the Croque Madame, Kimchi Toast, the Bostock and today I finally got to try the Ginger Pull Apart which was always sold out when I got there.

I'm officially a diehard Neighbor Bakehouse believer.  I mean, I would move here and move next door just so I could go here every day.  Nowadays I don't even bother going to Tartine cause everything here is so much better and consistently DELICIOUS.  The ginger pull apart is sooooo flaky and crispy and buttery it's like pastry heaven.  I mean, this place has over 300 reviews and is still a solid 5 stars.  I don't know what else I can add to this.  I don't think there's one thing here that I don't like.  They don't actually have THAT much stuff, but whenever I go I feel the need to order everything so it ends up being a lot.  Definitely get there early and make sure you're buying for a group so you can share and split stuff.  I got there at 7:30am and most everything was there - i've been there a few times at 10-11am ish and stuff would run out already. Wish there was something even 1/10th as good in NYC!< /review>

<date>1470776274763<//date><Review>Where do I begin with this place? I know - stop whatever you're doing, get in a car, über, or the T line muni, arrive at Neighbor and buy the ginger pull apart. This is my favorite pastry of all time. Why? It's a myriad of textures and flavors that evoke all the best aspects of perfect baked goods. The pastry is composed of croissant dough scraps pieced together and layered with sugar and crystallized ginger. Its got a bit of that super on trend kouign Amman swagger with twice the size and twice the textural variance. The top is light and airy like those awesome bubbles that form on the crust of a pizza. Inside it's doughy and soft, like the inner layers of a cinnamon roll or raised donut. The bottom gets a crazy crystalized sugar caramelization that sticks to your teeth like ginger taffy. The aroma is buttery with dancing ginger spice and is never too sweet or too spicy. It is perfection.

And that's just one pastry!!

Neighbor doesn't get the shine of some of the hipper spots in the city but it deserves all the glory. Their croissants are perfect, and I've tried them all from plain to chocolate (claw) to everything (bagel) to salmon to blackberry pistachio. Flawless layers of fluffy flour and butter. They also have a wonderful sauerkraut tart and rotating veggie tarts that perfectly balance savory ingredients with a sweet dough. I have literally tried almost every thing this shop has to offer and have never been disappointed.

They also offer whole loaves of bread, and recently I picked up a fresh sourdough sandwich loaf ($6) and made the best French toast of my life with it. Go to neighbor. You won't regret it.

Note: normally a spot that offers little-to-no seating would get a slight dock in my book but I'm in the "pick up pastries in my PJ's and bring them home" camp rather than try to deal with the early morning dog patch fog camp.</Review>< Response>

Got here a little before 11 and was able to try the passionfruit mango doughnut bun and the guava cream cheese pastelito. The passionfruit mango doughnut bun was so magical! The filling was the right balance of tarty and sweet. Delicious! The guava cream cheese pastelito was interesting. It was very flaky and buttery. The flavor reminded me of the same guava cream cheese roll from Porto's bakery. Also very good.
But the passionfruit mango doughnut bun! It's a must try!<//review>

Glad they now have a permanent presence. I have been a fan since Greg was selling out of the door of the nearby Mr.&Mrs.Miscellaneous ice cream store.
The goods are sold right from the trays from oven. Everythings well-crafted. I recommened the Croque Madames or the Ginger Pull-Aparts. Sometimes they have delicious bread pudding. Ask for it.</text>

<Review>(Translated by Google) Whichever you ate, it was delicious! On Sunday morning at 8.30 am was the right answer for the shop. After that, the long line quickly! Let's get up early and go buy ☆
