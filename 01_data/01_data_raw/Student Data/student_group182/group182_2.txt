Dr. Henry Kaw and his staff are some of the most wonderful medical professionals I have ever met. Unlike some doctors i have met in the past, this doctor will sit down and take the time to examine you, talk with you and help you understand what needs to be done to point you in the right path to recovery. He is not one of those doctors who looks at the records and makes recommendation according to what is on the screen or on paper. He genuinely cares. Of course his great reputation is also elevated even more with the help of his staff. They look at you and speak with you like a human being who cares about your wellbeing. Would I recommend him to others? YOU BET I WOULD!</Review>

My experience with this provider was not a great experience. I was a new patient and went in for a routine check up however he did not complete a check up and billed my insurance for a full check up. My boyfriend goes to Dr Kaw so I figured I would give him a try. For my boyfriend he does a full physical including blood work. It’s very upsetting to know now that my insurance was billed for a physical since Dr Kaw didn’t complete my physical. Now that I’ve had my baby I am do for a check up and can’t get that done because he would consider it as a ‘sick visit’ according to his assistant. When I went back in February Dr Kaw did not give me the appropriate time and the whole visit felt rushed like he wanted to get in and out of the room as quickly as possible. I would not recommend this place.< /Text>

This is the first Dr. I have seen that takes time to hear you and understand what your health care needs really are and he truly is a pro-active Physician.  His treatment doesn’t stop when you walk out the door. He is great with follow up and exploring your options for treatment.  I never have to wait long for him either and everyone of his staff are kind and courteous.  I highly recommend him for treating your health care needs!<//review>

Wish there was a 0 star. AVOID THIS FRAUD PLACE. I was charged for a follow up visit for physical and lab work. I checked well before if my visit is covered by insurance. They are dishonest and greedy people. When I asked for refill- they did not provide it unless seen by doctor again. Normally the prescription does not need re-visit to the doctor for an year. I am getting bills for visits and labs which were told to me that my insurance would cover it.</text>

Dr. Kaw has been mom's physician at Gordon Lane Care Center for some years now and I have been very grateful for his professional and attentive attention to her medical issues. His follow-up with the staff there is thorough and always in mom's best interests. He is also very accessible when I've called to discuss my concerns.
I have additionally seen Dr. Kaw as my personal doctor, and he and his office staff are all very professional, efficient, welcoming and available whenever I've needed to come in or make appointments.</Text>

I have been treated by Dr Kaw for over half a year now and I must say they give treat me like we have been friends since grade school.  They are professional and kind AND like friends you have had since kids they are honest and upfront.  That is exactly what I needed and Dr Kaw does just that.  Very honest and caring at the same time.  Because of Dr Kaw and his staff I have 1) avoided being Diabetic, 2) lowered my blood pressure to good and healthy levels, 3) I have lost over 60 lbs and 4) am healthier then I have been in the last 15 years!  Thank you Dr Kaw and Team!<//Review>< Pics>

Dr Kaw is awesome and has been my primary Doctor for 3 years now. He’s helped me with everything from my shoulder to ingrown nails! Plus always helps me so well when I get sick or my wife gets sick. Plus his staff is super nice to me and always texts or calls me when I have a Up coming appointment. I highly recommend them for everything! Plus they have a Med Spa now which my wife loves!< /review>

<Text>Found Dr Kaw on Google while I was looking for a local doctor for my brother. My brother is self-employed, doesnt have medical insurance and needed to  be treated right away.  I called Dr  Kaw's office and was able to get him an appointment for the same day.  His office visit fee for cash patients is affordable and he took care of my brother's issue immediately. The wait time was less than 5 minutes before we got called back, which of course was after my brother filled out all the required paperwork for a first-time patient. Dr Kaw is thorough, asked all the questions a doctor should about my brothers medical history, fast, friendly and well-educated.  His assistant and  front office staff are courteous as well.  I highly recommend Dr Kaw and will call him for myself if I ever need to see a doctor.</Text></record>

With your first step in, you will notice the cleanliness and ambiance that's fitting of a medical spa. This provides comfort and confidence that you know you're in the right place. There are times where you go to spas or massage parlors through yelp reviews or referrals but you still have a slither of doubt that it may not be fitting to your particular health need. This is why this place is unique.

This medical spa is owned and run by a physician (who also has staff qualified) equipped with highest quality of medical aesthetic therapy I have seen. Why I gave it 5 stars is because this therapy is also available at a reasonable price, similar to that of other mediocre spas I have been to. I'm writing this review to hopefully encourage some of you who have yet to try a medical spa. Whether it be for rejuvenation or skin care needs. I guarantee you, you are in good hands.< /Review>

Went for my Dr. Appointment today and found out I had a bill from when I was in the hospital in January. I told the receptionist I could pay $20 towards it.  She comes back a few minutes later and says the doctor needs another $100 to be able to see you. I am on a very limited budget and if I had known I had to pay this bill I would have never made the appointment. He is such a greedy doctor. I have never had a doctor in the past who wouldn't refill my medications that I have been taken for years without an appointment. Most doctors are fine seeing me every 6 months and would refill my prescriptions for 6 months. I just left the office angry to be treated this way.  And to top it off when I was in the hospital he maybe saw me at the most for 15 minutes while I was there the 2 days. and my part of the bill was almost $300  and I am sure he got at least that much from my insurance. What happened to doctors being more concerned about the people they treat. I will never go back to him and hopefully I can find a new doctor soon to refill my meds.< /review>

As an ICU nurse who has struggled with many doctors, I just can say that Dr.Henry Kaw is awesome.
I drive all the way from Santa Fe Springs to Fullerton to see him because it totally worth it.
He is one of the most professional doctors that I have met and he also has an amazing personality as a human being. His staff are so helpful, caring, professionaland nice and I really have no idea how they manage to keep this place so amazingly clean.
So happy that I chose Dr.Kaw as my primary doctor and recommend him 100% 👍🏽< /review>

<Text>Dr. Henry Kaw is always very friendly, thorough, detail oriented and has always been available for my family and myself when we needed him!
My parents also sees him and are very happy.
Dr. Kaw also calls me to inform me of my test results when they are abnormal. At each appointment he thoroughly discuss tests, as well how it relates to my health condition - in clear understandable terms.
I know that he is not fond of antibiotics, but he always tell me to call his office back of my symptoms gets worse and he will send in some prescriptions.
His staff is so accommodating and friendly.
Highly recommended !!!<//Text><rate>5< /rate>< gmapID>

Intentionally made time to prepare for my first consultation with Dr. Kaw to make sure I have a list of topics to discuss with him.  Went through the list with his Nurse prior to him coming into the room. Unfortunately it was very difficult to keep him focused on the topics as he started to talk about random things that had nothing to do with my visit.  Even the Nurse was trying to steer him back to the topics. A day later I called to follow up on a prescription he was supposed to call in - but I was told that the Doctor couldn't prescribe medication unless he looked at the condition first.  Very disappointing.< /review>

<time>1567885199038< /time><name>ed lago< /name><Text>Been a patient of Dr Kaw for 2 1/2 years and had nothing but positive
experiences. The staff is efficient, professional and friendly. Waiting time
is average of less than 15 min from your appointment time. The doc is
young, energetic and knows what he's doing as well as what's going on
with your health condition. The slightest hint of something wrong and
he will send you off to one of the network specialist for preventive evaluation and/or treatment. The clinic is accessible to all right in the
heart of downtown Fullerton. You can ask Dr Kaw about anything relating
to your health and he will tell you what is real and what is not. You can
even ask him where he went for vacation. They wont give you cookies and
tea while there but they will treat you like family and friends. If you're
looking for a Principal Care Provider (PCP), Dr Henry Kaw is THE MAN.</Text><gmapID>0x80dcd5f651244633:0xdaf71a38a80d074a< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

I met Dr. Henry Kaw about a year ago, my mother had just suffered multiple strokes and was in need of full time care. We met Dr. Kaw at a SNF that he was working at at the time. My mother has so much going on with her health & I was afraid that we would not find a PCP that we could really trust to provide the care she really needs. Dr. Kaw was the doctor that was assigned to her, since we didn't have a PCP for her at the time... From the very first moment we met Dr. Kaw we knew he was a great fit for us & he has never let us down since. Dr. Kaw has seen us through some pretty hard times & is always so kind & caring which helps out immensely.
He's very respectful, attentive, a great listener & never hesitates to ask if there's anything else he can do for us.
He truly is the best PCP we've ever had!</Review>

<Text>I have been a patient of Dr. Kaw for few years. He is an exceptional medical provider. He communicates to his patient in such a way that I am able to understand each medical condition I experience. Dr. Kaw is one of the best physician I have ever had.

<review>The doctor was unprofessional. If you are not going to him for check up, he is not gonna take care of you. Other doctor gave me some papers which should be signed by my family doctor. And I took those documents for a signature to him as my family doctor. But he refused to sign it , saying that he doesn’t have any idea what those papers are. I explained and showed him what those papers are, he still refused to sign saying that, he doesn’t have time for that.
The point is he sees you as a money rather than a patient.his number one priority is money not a health of patient. I don’t recommend anyone this doctor.<//review>< resp>

This is line with the rules and regulations of your insurance. Your wife walked in (and not you) asking us to sign a referral for you and her, AFTER your procedure was already done.\n\nUnfortunately we never referred you to the practitioner to that you already saw.  I spoke with your practitioner and he understood why I did not sign the form.\n\nIf you have any questions regarding how referrals should be sent, please call your insurance customer service department.\n\nWe hope that you will find another doctor will take care of you demands soon.'}</resp>

Great group. Dr. Kaw takes care of all my medical needs and thourghly explains everything in an easily understood manner. He interacts with my

<Text>Dr. Kaw and his staff are very friendly and helpful.  They are responsive to my issues and concerns.  Dr. Kaw is a young man who practices medicine "the old fashioned way" with personal attention to his patients.  He does not rush his appointments and I feel that he genuinely cares about people.  If you don't like being part of a giant medical corporation where customer service has been industrialized, Dr. Kaw and his staff are your solution.  It is easy to park at his office, the rooms are comfortable, wait times are reasonable and it's not difficult to make an appointment.  I highly recommend his practice.</Text>< pics>

I first met Dr Kaw when he came to the Senior home to see my mother. Dr. Kaw took great care of my mother who was in her 90s at that time.

After seeing the care which Dr Kaw provided for my mother, I became a patient of his.

Dr Kaw is very knowledgeable, caring and really interested in you as a patient. He is a great Doctor and I strongly recommend him as a family physician.

He office staff and assistants are extremely helpful and friendly.

I recently moved to the area and transferred to Dr. Kaw's office and I couldn't be happier.  At my previous doctors office the wait times were long and once I was seen, I felt rushed.  Dr. Kaw and his staff go above and beyond to make you feel welcome. Dr. Kaw really takes the time to listen/ talk to you and make sure he covers everything.< /Review>

<Review>I went 20 min before my appointment and I wait for 45min after that for no reason, until I went to the front desk and asked them what is going on, turns out they forget about me hahaha.
Any way they apologize and they took me inside so the doctor can see me.
The other thing that’s piste me off is no one called me after my lab results, I called them to se what is the results, a gain the forget.
Unfortunately the staff is not doing there job and the doctor is not following up with his patients.</Review>< Pictures>

I have always been skeptical with new spas as they sprout everywhere, they come and go, and most of all, I have had bad experiences with a few. I used to go to a spa in Cerritos and then went with my esthetician that went freelancing after. Then my co-workers started raving about this new medical spa in Fullerton and I got so curious.  I finally went with some of friends and co-workers and oh my - I fell in love with The Retreat Medical Spa!

The ambiance is to die for, ultra-clean, comfortable, cozy, and luxurious. It is like walking into a high-end hotel. The hospitality of the staff is exemplary. I met the doctor who owns the place and then I was greeted with great smiles the staff and was offered their special house drink (which was apparently a recipe of the owner) and other refreshments - coffee, tea, etc.). I was then escorted to relax in their lounge, dimmed lights, cozy leather sofa, a selection of my favorite magazines. The ambiance was exhilarating and romantic - I wished that my husband was with me at that very moment.

I have had recent injection from Dr. Kaw. He made sure I understand the risk, benefits and side effects of my treatment. He made my injection so effortless, quick and with results that my friends are now so jealous of. Not to mention he has a very light touch.  I have referred more than ten friends to him since my injections.

Now lets talk about my facial treatment experience. As I mentioned earlier, I am very picky with my estheticians.  For the past few months, I have had both Amanda and Yvette, who are both very skillful and knowledgeable with the skin and esthetic skin products. They explain the steps of the treatment and answered my questions quite impressively. By the way, this medical spa uses both ZO Obagi and Skinmedica products that are high-end and expensive medical grade products. How do I know? Because I am a nurse, and I research anything that is used on my skin. Of course, they carry the same back bar products for purchase but they are not pushy at all to sell. I also tried their algae peel-off mask from Spain and it was heavenly soothing.

I also have had few massages there from Martin, Jessica and Jenny. They have different techniques but I enjoyed either one of them when I had my deep tissue and trigger point massage therapies.  I was skeptical at first to have a male massage therapist but because I know the owner of the spa is a medical doctor, I felt at ease that he would have screened his staff carefully. True enough, Martin was very professional.

A splendor of beauty and skillful staff describes my now routine monthly "retreat" at this spa. I now call this place my second home because my skin always feel rejuvenated. I also find joy and peace with the solemnity of the place and the hospitality of the staff.<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None<//resp><gmap_id>0x80dcd5f651244633:0xdaf71a38a80d074a< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<text>It was crowded on New Year’s Day as expected.  It was a hazy day but the views were still breath taking.  We hiked from the north rim parking lot and climbed to the power lines.  This is a 4 mile round trip moderate hike.  It’s rocky with mile hill inclines.</text></record>

<Text>Been going to Upper Bidwell Park/Monkey Face/Lower Bidwell/Horseshoe "Lake" (more of a pond now) and "The Dirt Road" all my life because I grew up right at the trail head to the "Dirt Road." It's been no doubt a big part of what keeps me in love with chico...and the girl I still love from high school for almost 20 years.

The trails are awesome for hiking and biking. They take you to fresh cold running creek water that consists of huge swimming holes that are famous, the top of the mountain for beautiful views, a frisbee golf course, the iconic "Monkey face", golf course and the planetarium.

Since the  virus, the trails have been extremely overcrowded, lots of trash and dog poop. I'm guessing it's because of the gyms closed. If you decide to enjoy the adventures of all that outdoor chico life has to offer, then make sure to pick up what you drop. Keep chico clean, natural and beautiful and it will return the favor.  😎< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< Gmap_id>

Beautiful view of Chico and the surrounding areas from this spot. It takes between 15-20 minutes to hike up from the parking lot. Once up there, there are little caves in between the rocks to explore and take pictures from.< /Text>

Great trail. Moderately difficult if you walk the full loop. Will take you 2-3 hours easily. Dogs can roam off leash.!!</Review>

<Review>I climbed to the top of this view, in the dark of night, one summer almost 20 years ago. It is one of the most beautiful views I've experienced in my entire life, and I shared it with a very good friend of mine. There were so many shooting stars, which romanticized it a bit. I hope to hang onto this memory forever.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

<text>I climbed to the top of this view, in the dark of night, one summer almost 20 years ago. It is one of the most beautiful views I've experienced in my entire life, and I shared it with a very good friend of mine. There were so many shooting stars, which romanticized it a bit. I hope to hang onto this memory forever.</text>< response>

If you are a beginners hiking this is the place to go. Dozens of different trails to go on from very low impact to more difficult.</review>

A great short but steep hike that rewards you with a beautiful view of the valley.  It's also quite the social hub, so expect to run into friends!< /text>

<date>1623946871369< /date><text>We checked out several window replacement businesses, before deciding on Cobex. What impressed us the most, besides the product, were the people. After a hiccup, they were on it immediately and were honest and up front about getting it fixed. Not only did they get it fixed, we ended up with more than we had paid for. We love our new windows, great installers, neat, clean and very hard workers. We will definitely use them again, this company has integrity.< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< userid>

< Review>
Dmitry, the designer, came in and guided us through the process of selecting materials for our remodel. He is very helpful and knowledgable about the intended work. When the job began, he brought in his crew, Alex and Alzhan to meet us and go over the plan.

The crew came in everyday on time and worked through until 4 pm because we had asked them to not work past 4 pm. When they left each day, the work area was secured and clean. Usually we were gone by the time they came in but we came in just before quiting time to see what all had taken place that day. At that time, Alex would explain what had been done and what the next steps would include. At that time he would ask us if there were any other things we wanted to know about.

The crew was very respectful of our home, protecting the flooring in the traffic areas, neatly stacking materials and equipment by the end of the work day.

Our master bathroom is only 5'X10' and this job took 2 weeks. Thanks guys, we love our new bathroom.</Review>

Cobex did a great job on our siding and windows! The communication was great, and the materials and workmanship were all top-notch.  Based on my experience, I definitely recommend Cobex to anyone looking for a great siding or window replacement contractor.<//Review>

Called Cobex yesterday to come and get a estimate for windows, had the appointment today and David aka Project Consultant/Manager! David was very professional, courteous, explained everything in plain language that I could understand that will be done, the time frame.The total cost was great! Stay tuned for pictures after the install. I would most definitely recommend this company and ask for David👍👍<//review>

Cobex and the entire team were very professional, courteous, on time each day.  The quality of their workmanship is a 10!  They demolished our roof and replaced it with a beautiful new roof.  We are excited with our new roof.  They responded quickly when we had questions and worked great with our insurance company to make sure everyone understood the process.  I will use them again if the situation presents itself.   Thank you again for all you did for us.!!!!< /review>

<review>I recently purchased this home about a little over a year (14 mos ago). My husband and I decided to redo the windows. We got four estimate and cobex had the best price and quality and it is backed up with two warranty.  No business would back up there products  if they know they are good. We are very pleased with our windows.
They are professional and do good work. I am so happy with my window. I notice the temperature difference already we have several picture windows that would make are home very hot in my house. My house feel much cooler during this time of the year.  I have 35 windows and two sliding doors.  Max and his crew were so patient with us and explained how the work was going to be done.   I was so pleased that when I told them to start at the lower section of the home they comply with my request. You can’t go wrong with upgrading your windows they make a big difference. Thank you Max and to his crew.</review>< username>

The guys at Cobex did a terrific job remodeling our kitchen. They replaced the cabinets, counter tops,  flooring, back splashes and removed a wall. We will definitely use them again for future remodeling and we definitely recommend them for any work you might have.< /text>

Their Salesman Julian is top notch. His
Communication was great, he showed up on time and conducted himself with the utmost professionalism. While we weren’t able to move forward with our roofing project at this time, I feel confident that had we done so, they would have taken great care of us. We will definitely keep Cobex Construction Group and particularly salesman Julian in mind for projects moving forward.<//review>

I just want everyone to know what a professional and easy to work with company that Cobex Construction has been for me. I had all of my windows replaced and a new roof put on as well as new heating/ac unit. That’s a big job! Flawless! From what to expect to every penny of what it would cost I was completely satisfied. My sales representative David was very knowledgeable and kind as well as attentive to me every step of the way!!! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

David came to our home to do an estimate for fallen fences and a damaged roof from the storm a few weeks ago.
He was very professional and produced an estimate fairly quickly.
He did an excellent job with explaining the processs, costs, and even stating that we could have all the repairs done in the next 3 weeks and it’ll only take 3 days.
Highly recommend.< /text>

< Review>
We need to replace our patio roof along with a large (99”x99”) dome skylight.  Sergey and Dimitri came to our house and we discussed the options and our preference.  Sergey was most efficient in finding the manufacturer for a similar skylight and he then gave us a quote.

The construction was set to a month later and was completed in a most efficient and professional way. We are very happy with their advice, the coordination of the project,  and the efficiency of the workers ( especially the roofer Paul).  We will definitely use Cobex for our future projects and are very happy to recommend them to our friends!</Review>

The guys over at Cobex are excellent! They offer financing on small and large projects (Siding, Paint, Windows, etc.) and provide fair priced, concise, clean quality work.

I have many home improvement projects and did not want to finance. Instead I've chipped away at misc. home improvements throughout the past year and Cobex works with us everytime! They are flexible and accommodating and I 100% recommend them to every and anyone looking to paint, repair or replace siding, windows, full kitchen remodeling.

Sergey, Max, Alex and all the rest of the guys are a family business and take great pride in their work. I am proud to have met them and look forward to working with them in the future!<//Text>

We had roof replacement and new gutters installed. Cobex was a great company to work with from the start and Sergey was very responsive and kept us current on the status of the job. The workers were very professional and cleaned up the ground around the house each day. We are very happy with the roof and the new gutters look amazing along with the gutter guards. I highly recommend the company.</text>

<Text>David, who visited our property and provided a quote, was professional and friendly. What we appreciated most was his commitment to following up with us when many other companies lacked in communication. We were deciding between Cobex from our good experience with David and another company, but ultimately chose the other company due to its lower price for the same material and workmanship warranties.< /Text>< Response>

<Review>Cobex replaced an old leaky shake roof on my detached garage. It looks great and matches the rest of the house.

I called to make an appointment for an estimate and a helpful lady answered. She had me on the schedule within a few days and even called to remind me/confirm our appointment. (None of the other 3 roofers/companies answered my 1st or 2nd call or called me back over a 3 day period).

Sergey arrived for the estimate and took the time to walk me through the process, make recommendations, and provided a clear statement of work based on what we discussed.

A few things that stood out about the Cobex team:
They are communicative
They had clean and maintained equipment and vehicles
They arrived on time
They handled permits/inspections
They completed the project on budget
They delivered 2 weeks ahead of schedule

Overall, very happy and highly recommend them.<//Review>< pictures>

I needed a new HVAC system badly. No heat. I was going through a refi though and had to wait for it to close before I could make a major purchase or finance. Because everyone was doing refinances the loan took 2 months longer to close.
Cobex knew I was going to need the HVAC installed the minute I could. The day my loan closed they ran everything and got it going. they even came out on a sunday and worked all day to get me heat as fast as possible.

They were extremely professional and their customer service from all their crew was exceptional. I enjoyed working with them. Their finance rates were hands down the best I found as well.</Review>

Cobex replaced the 56-year-old roof on my just-purchased home all the way down to the rafters.  Shingles replaced were about 25 years old, but the "deck" was original.

Their salesan, David Leal, ecplained evetything about the roof and how all the different parts of it would be replaced, do there was complete peace of mind on this project.

Both the teardown and installation teams were excellent.  The project was on-time and the site supervisors were professional and kept me updated every step of the way.

i will be using Cobex' services in future for  indoor remodeling of kitchen and baths next year.

Thank you Cobex for the excellent work and the 50-year warranty on my beautiful new roof

<text>This was a project started and completed the end of 2018.  I did not rate them on Google at the time.  I am in the Rescue/Shingle Springs area and was having a very difficult time finding a contractor here in the foothills that would even give me a quote.  Cobex was a lifesaver!

The Cobex Construction Group experience was great. Dave Palmer kept me informed. Although we were scheduled to start our project in January, they were able to move it up the first part of December. This was a lifesaver for us, as we had a houseful coming for the holidays. They successfully and professionally finished a week before my guests started arriving. Alex and his crew were great. He discussed with me what they were doing and when they expected to finish. Very pleased with their work!< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

<Text>Both Sergie and Viktor were the nicest most professional men I have worked with. They tell you exactly what the issues may be, provide recommendations, and work within your budget. I knew what what happening every step of the way. The customer service was amazing. Any questions were answered quickly and they gave me a great price. The did the work and left the site cleaner than when they arrived. I feel fortunate to have found them.</Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

I have looked at few companies for quotes for roofing, fascia root and HVAC had three different leak in the house from last raining season and my HVAC was a old unit could not keep my house cool when it 97 or hotter. some Quotes are high and some low but extra fee if you don't read the small line and financing was one part of it.  I didn't what my credit pull to much. I was in a pickle cause the raining season was around the corner. I happen to remember Cobex from a billboard on my way to work. I look them up before i call them found that they can do all kind of project and multiple financing options was a Plus so i give them a call David Leal came out to give me a estimate. very informant in their product and service and process of how the work will get done.  He was able to answer all my questions and concern the price was good it what you be paying no hidden fee average not to low or high.  I was able to get financing from them for the project at a good rate as my credit union.
they always in contact with you as project and inspection are being work on you can always call them with question with there cell number. I even have them do my wood siding for my front house too since it was in my payment rage. i say my house look good. my neighbor love the new look. i differently would recommend calling them for any project you may need. they are on my next list of of project i have line up.

We recently had a leak in our roof during the last storm, so I called Cobex and had them come out to give an estimate. They came out the next day, at the arranged time. They were very reasonably priced so we decided to go ahead and have them do the work. Within 24 hours they had set up a time to come out immediately, so they could get the work finished before the next rain. We got the estimate on Tuesday and Thursday they showed up on time and completed the work in about 3 hours. They discovered cracked tiles near my solar panels and took pictures. I went ahead and had them replace the broken tiles, clean the valley, and fix the leak. They were very friendly, professional, and thorough. They even brought some trash off the roof the solar guys had left behind and blew the leaves off of my front porch. Since they are also a construction company, I will definitely be calling them again in the future for other maintenance.< /text>

<text>A couple of roof tiles came loose and slid out of place. Also on another part of the roof I had a broken tile that needed replacing. I called Cobex on Monday, they came out Tuesday to scope the work and made the repairs on Wednesday. They also inspected the roof and reattached some other loose tiles. Outstanding work and response! I am very happy with Cobex.<//text>< gmap_id>

Vazgen and his team very extremely professional, patient, and adaptive to changing circumstances. I had a massive remodeling of two balconies of 3000 square feet in El Dorado hills. I had dry rot everywhere beyond repair. So we needed to rip it all out and start all over. Cobex wasn’t my cheapest option but they were definitely worth the cost. The took over the project from start to finish including all the strenuous permit process with the city. Most important of all Vazgen and his project leaders were honest honest honest. I can’t stress enough. I own over a dozen real estate and that’s a rare gem to come by in construction business. They instead of hiding their mistake or blaming others would accept and took responsibility for any minor (fortunately nothing major) errors along the way. I recommend them without hesitation.</Text>

<Text>We had a patio cover installed and it is beautiful! It went up in one day but It took 3 inspections for them to get the electrical up to code. This was a very easy project that took WAY longer than it should have. They did see it through and make all the corrections but it was a major inconvenience. The other issue that we had is lack of communication. If I didn't call every few days to check in on the status up to the installation I don't know that I ever would have heard from anyone.<//Text><pics>None</pics><user>115281185697407291869<//user><Gmap_id>0x809b222146f467a5:0xf2b0411e2090a0c8< /Gmap_id><resp>{'time': 1565829803819, 'text': 'Thank you so much for your review Kelly!

I hired Cobex to replace a retaining wall in my front yard and they were excellent to work with.
The quote process was thorough and explained completely before the work began.
From when the work began to when the work was completed Sergey called to keep me updated several times during the day.
When the job was completed the results were better than I expected and they performed additional work at no extra cost.

I will definitely be hiring them for my next project.<//Text>

Surgey and his crew did a fabulous job on my parents roof. I stepped in for my parents after 7 months of dealing with AAA insurance who were asking for ridiculous itemization from all the contractors, no one wanted to do this because it was a hassle. So, I called Cobex and explained what was going on with AAA and Surgey the owner was very helpful. He went back and fourth with my parents insurance. Which was above & beyond. Such a professional, helpful and nice Guy, I really do appreciate everything. I recommend Cobex for any contractor needs you have. Our roof looks so nice and they really took great care of us.</Text>

After coming to my door to solicit business, no one ever showed up for the appointment we set for an estimate.

In response to your reply: I was not able to confirm the appointment because I lost my cell phone days before the appointment. But that still does not change the fact that we had a standing appointment that you failed you follow-thru on and showup for. Your failure to keep your word by appearing for the appointment we had previously set has led me to the decision to use another company for years of ongoing improvements on the home I recently purchased. It's very unfortunate that your company lacks the integrity, honesty, respect, and professionalism that your claim to have in your core values.<//review>

From day one when Sergey, the owner of Cobex Construction Group, showed up to give me a free estimate for painting the trim work on my house I felt comfortable and I was impressed by his thorough inspection of the work area, his attention to detail and the knowledge he had in doing his job. I had another estimate which was much lower but I called Sergey the next day, who along with his team started working on the project. They matched the color perfectly, replaced the boards which were damaged by dry rot and finished the job in few hours.
I will strongly recommend Cobex Construction Group to my friends and relatives.< /Review>

We are so happy with our new bathroom! They showed up on time, did everything we asked and even a little extra. I have had bad experiences with contractors in the past and normally don't write reviews, but they did such a great job I definitely recommend them.<//review>

They did a great job on remodeling our laundry room. They showed up and finished on-time, stayed on budget and cleaned up when they were done. I will be using them in the near future to update my kitchen.<//Text>

<Review>Would like to take a moment to write a review regarding our experience with Cobex.  My wife and I consulted with them during the Sacramento Home & Garden Expo this year and initially scheduled an in-home consultation with them for a couple of weeks out.  We never received a phone call to confirm but didn't think much of it because after multiple consultations with other contractors and other home improvement businesses and only receiving confirmations around half the time, we thought this was normal but at least these other folks actually showed up.  We waited around and nobody ever showed up so we called the general business line and they didn't have us scheduled in their system for whatever reason.  While that was disappointing cause we took time off from our work and life schedules, we were forgiving and understand mistakes happen so used it as an opportunity to reschedule with them for the following week.  A week passes and it's appointment day and the consultant scheduled to visit us calls on the day of the appointment 15 mins after our scheduled time saying he was going to be 45 mins late so we rescheduled again.  Another 2 weeks pass and we finally have our appointment in home which happens again 45 mins after our scheduled time but since we've had scheduling challenges, we obliged to waiting around for him to arrive.  Upon arrival, we describe to our consultant what we want to do (new interior doors throughout, crown molding and new baseboards upstairs along with helping us enhance our exterior balcony upstairs to make it a more useable space).  The person we met with was quite friendly and we felt good about the initial consultation and even potentially doing business with Cobex if the price was within our budget.  We were really looking forward to seeing what he would come up with in terms of pricing which he said he would get to us 2 days later.  We met on a Monday and don't like to rush people but by Saturday we still hadn't heard from him via phone or email so I emailed him directly hoping for a response.  It's now going on almost 2 weeks since the consultation and still no word or follow up so we've given up out of frustration and decided to take our home improvement projects elsewhere.  It's disappointing considering how great the other reviews I've read are about Cobex.  We're not sure what happened or their business justification for not following up with potential customers but if one thing I've learned in my professional experience in selling is that you never leave a customer hanging.  If they aren't a good fit for whatever reason, at least have common business courtesy to let them know.  That's just good business practice.  For anyone else looking to leverage Cobex for their home improvements, hopefully this review provides some additional insight / visibility into what you may or may not expect in terms of your experience with them.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

<Name>Abbe Peters</Name><Text>Bottom line, these gentlemen are top notch!  I so appreciate their quick response, punctuality, easy to understand communication, thoroughness of plan, a fair estimate, attention to detail, and the work done to perfection.  I will not hesitate to call them for future projects.

Here's my story. After looking for two years and against my better judgement I bought a flipped house.  The home inspection was clean for a 60 year old house, but of course the house has since revealed more problems than I had been led to believe.

Last winter after heavy rains, I noticed some discoloration and dampness on a small section of baseboard.  No major wetness, but something wasn't right.  During the summer I decided to get some bids before winter returned.  Two companies came out, but the solutions they proposed didn't make sense to me and on top of that, both were late for the appointment, one by four hours. Neither one suggested taking off the baseboard to see what may be happening behind it.

Then Alex from Cobex came out.  He was on time, personable and quickly pinpointed what was most likely the source of the problem and explained it in a way that made sense to me.  From there he scheduled an appointment to have one of his experienced associates come out to take off the interior baseboard and to peek behind the exterior siding. He corroborated what Alex suspected was shoddy installation of two new windows and a new slider by the previous owner.  The same afternoon, Alex came out and really spent time discussing a solution and a very detailed plan of action that was easy for me to visualize.  The following morning I received an email from Alex that thoroughly depicted the plan including proposal, materials and timeframe, from start to finish and even included possible contingency plans, in case when further into the walls, the damage was more than anticipated, along with what I thought was a fair estimate for a lot of work that included pulling up and re-stretching carpet, mold remediation, removing and reinstalling base board and exterior siding and trim, sealing badly installed windows and slider, caulking and painting inside and out.

Alex quickly fit me in to his busy schedule and was sensitive that winter was fast approaching and wanted to get the work done for me before the wet season returned. His workers were friendly, respectful, trustworthy, showed up on time and did exactly what I expected and cleaned up beautifully.  Everything looked flawless, neat and tidy and completed on time. After they left, Alex came out to inspect the work.  He found a few slight imperfections, that I didn't even notice, and had someone come out the following day for a touch up. Just wonderful!< /Text>< gmap_id>

My word means Everything! Cobex was not holding up to theirs, rather blaming sales fokes for miscalculating square footage rather than standing by word.

Expect a price increased after your original quote through “production”. Cobex management blames frontline employees for mistakes rather than taking responsibility!<//Text>

<Text>My wife and I contracted with Cobex Construction Group to make improvements, upgrades and repairs to our home in the Ridgewiew Neighborhood El Dorado Hills.  The house is a one of one design by the architect owner that we have owned for 4 years.

My review will be in several parts because  the projects will take time during the winter months.  I can't say enough good things about their estimating and contracting process, workmanship and follow up on all aspects of the work.

From the beginning, getting an initial estimate and many discussions about what would look best  from design through construction was informative and excellent.  Everything was covered, no guess work and full disclosure if there were issues spotted and how we wanted to proceed.

The project consisted of updating the kitchen with new Quartzite surfaces and some appliances.  The Quartzite is a natural stone from Brazil and the backslash is glass subway tile that we purchased from Bedrosians.  We had the electrical switches and plugs updated with Legrand Adorna.  A new Sharp drawer microwave, Bosch dishwasher and a GE Profile cook top hood. The microwave required cabinet modifications and the hood required cutting the stone surround to fit the vent which it was done perfectly.  The cabinet modifications were completed with precision and even the touch up paint for the farm house cabinets matched perfectly.

Our kitchen had solid granite counter tops that were installed when the house was new, 2001.  The counter tops had seams in the granite that went through the sinks and were not level or really match up.

The COBEX crew came in an put down heavy duty paper to protect our Hickory floors. They put up a sheet plastic wall around the kitchen to keep the dust from going into the dining area and family room.  They removed all of the granite counter tops, the island and back splash behind the cook top.

Afterward, everything was spotlessly vacuumed up and taken away.  Next they put down new plywood counter top base and backer board for the tile back splash, nearly 70 SQ feet.  They made all of their templates and off to the fabricator.

The fabricator returned and removed more of the stone surround for the cook top and one wall cabinet.  He had fabricated the counters all, without any seams.  He and his crew worked tirelessly to fit these huge pieces in perfectly.  FYI.  The quartzite is a very hard natural stone and it took extra time to cut and shape.  The tile setter did an amazing job with the glass subway tile and moving the electrical boxes to a high level on the wall.  It sparkles and looks fantastic.

We stood in the kitchen just admiring the stone and the craftsmanship.  We had a party two weeks ago and everyone was impressed with the kitchen and their amazing craftsmanship.

We had all of the rain gutters replaced as the old one were in poor shape.  The COBEX construction group had the sub contractor measure everything and consulted me all along the way.  After the gutters were installed, Alex from COBEX walked the entire perimeter with the gutter fabricator to insure everything was perfect.

We also had the eaves inspected for dry rot, the COBEX crew came though, stripped back 2 rows of tile, removed the damaged areas and replaced everything very nicely.  Alex walked the entire roof with the sub-contractor to follow up on all of the repairs and to insure everything was perfect.

Last will be the upgrade of the 2 HVAC units in a very tight a difficult area.

I'll be writing as these next projects get completed.  With the rainy weather it will take a little longer.

Alex, Vaz and the COBEX team are fantastic and respond to every email or question we have had.<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures><response>{'time': 1544569370642, 'text': 'We are so pleased to hear that you are satisfied with our work, thank you for choosing Cobex Construction to complete your project San!'}</response>< gmap_id>

<Text>I was waiting in line maybe 5 minutes before a woman walked in and stood in line beside me, then as the people ordering in front of me finished the employee started to help me before the woman stepped up to the counter and the employee told me to wait and helped her instead. It was incredibly rude considering I had been in line and visible to the employee for a good 5 minutes before this woman came in and was helped before me anyways, from the way they were talking I can only assume they're friends as well which makes it worse. I love Subway's food but the employees make or break the experience.< /Text>< Pictures>

< Review>
This location is well known for the employee's bad attitude against the customers. They are engaged with each other and ignore the customer's requests. They are like in auto mode and do not ask how we want our food. They just assume we all like our sub toasted. Being a made-to-order place, they should pay more attention and heed customer's request. The concept of a smile is something alien to them. I do not believe the subway corporation or the particular owner of this franchised location spend any money or make any efforts to train their employees in providing an excellent customer service. The employees forget the customers are their paycheck,  as 20% of the tilt is use for payroll. Hopefully some one with the authority to do something will read this and do something about it.<//Review>

I Ordered Online And They Got My Whole Order WRONG, Whatever I Wanted On My Sandwich Was All Backwards ! To Make It Worse They Didn’t Give Me My Whole Order . I Tried Calling 8 Time And Not Once Did I Get An Answer ! I’m Really Disappointed In This Place Especially Since It’s The Nearest Place By Me . I Don’t Think I’ll Be Coming Back Here In Time Soon Or Maybe At All .</review>

Farmer Boys has always been my favorite place, not only is the food good, you always get enough to eat, doggy bag to go, Everytime. Customer Service is Farmer Boys, you don't have to get up and ask for service, they make it their business to ask patrons if theirs anything else you need. Five stars</text>

<text>The store Mgr. Smila , Andre , Precious , Joeanne , Candy and others give very bad service . They don't listen , they just want to argue with you . They shouldn't be their . Some times the food looks bad . They don't value good customers who pay their salary . Everything with them is calculus .< /text>< pics>

< Review>
Today Monday the 27th of March I came to Subway to get me a sandwich I asked my sandwich maker to change her glove because she had them on before I even came through the door she had a major attitude with me all because I asked her to change her gloves before she made my sandwich, she's not knowing if I have allergic reaction to anything or not I really thought it was extremely unprofessional of her. In my opinion she needs to be retrained!< /Review>

It correlates to the neighborhood. The floors are all sticky and tables are typically messy. Also the chairs are very uncomfortable. But the food is the same as other Subway restaurants.<//Review>

<Text>Cars are all scratched up, missing door handle, lots of chips in paint it’s like they don’t even try to make them look nice seems like they just want a quick sale and they aren’t professional. Submitted an application for approval was told it was good to go come tomorrow and drove an hour to get there for them to say sorry it’s sold cause someone put a down payment... yet the car was held and approved for me?  gladly I didn’t get a car from them look like cars won’t last long there weren’t noticeable considering the conditions of their cars. VERY used looking car lot< /Text>< pictures>

<review>Omar helped me pick out the perfect car. I was concerned about a sound on the car and he offered to fix it before I take it, and even offered a rental car until it’s fixed. He was patient with me as I looked for the perfect car for me.</review>< pics>

<review>Fantastic service with a fantastic staff! Jose helped me get into a beautiful car and helped me stay within my budget. He helped to make the entire process fast, efficient and very professional. This is the 2nd time I did business with Prestige and was not disappointed, they treated me with the same dignity, respect and professional manner just like when I was their 1st time customer, absolutely wonderful! They have even helped my husband also finance a great car. Brilliant and helpful staff. May God bless them to help many others for many more years!!< /review>< pictures>

I'll be the first to tell you my dislike for the whole car buying experience as a whole. But from the moment me and my son started talking to the owner Abe it was immediately felt the folks at Prestige had our best interest at heart. We came into Prestige to purchase a car for my son and left fully satisfied with our purchase. I appreciated the integrity from the enitre staff. I don't like using the word "salesman" but the sales rep George made sure this car buying experience went as smooth as possible. Prestige made every and all efforts to make sure I felt good about this major purchase and addressed all concerns I had. Again this purchase is for my son. I would highly recommend stopping buy and taking a look at their inventory. Also, they have an excellent detailing team. 10/10< /Review>

<Review>I bought a car from there and I'm kinda of disappointed with. Ive only had it for 7 month's and I've had to put new tires on it and when i went to a tire shop to get an alignment they said it couldn't be done cause the rods were messed up. Plus it doesn't have keyless entry or a navgation system. The customer service was excellent and they gave me a deal but still would of like to have gotten something faster and newer<//Review><time>1620948803901< /time><resp>None</resp>< Pics>

The person who attended us was on what we looking for,  the problem I noticed on 3 different cars I saw they was dirty,  stain on seats door panels looks like someone spill a coffee on it. As a dealer need to put attention on cleanness its the fir thing I cough my eye,  and make me think if they don't take care of the out side how it's the engine o transmission maybe they check only if it starts  and offered to the public.<//review>

Bought a truck thru prestige. Jose was outstanding with his customer service and patience. Abe was Awesome with explaining everything about the warranty that I purchased and his customer service as well. Easy no hassle transactions. I would give 10 stars if I could.< /review>

My salesman was a guy called Abe. He was very helpful from the beginning. The first car I wanted, 2019 Corolla, was sold before I had the chance to make a deposit but then I saw a 2020 on their lot and liked it. Since I really wanted the 2019, which was cheaper, and it sold, he made me a very good deal on the 2020. I was buying the car out of state (in Oklahoma) and it was the first time he was doing an out of state sale. Being the 1st time, I think he did great. He was very honest about the condition of the car and they even took it to a mechanic to get checked. He also helped a great deal with the shipping. It was an awesome experience. I would buy from them again</text>

My son and I just purchased a used vehicle from this dealership.  We were very pleased with the entire purchase process and the way we were treated.  Salesperson Jose was extremely helpful in making sure we ended up with a vehicle that we liked and at the right price.  We told him we had come to Modesto from the bay area to look at a specific vehicle, however that vehicle had just sold.  Jose helped us in finding another vehicle, and once we found one that my son liked, Jose was able to get the manager to approve a reduction in the price.  This was on top of already low prices compared to bay area dealers.  (I know as I had shopped extensively online before visiting this dealership.)  He also helped us get an extra key and keyfob made at a local locksmith, even covering some of that cost.  Finally, I asked for floormats, and he located a set and threw them in at no extra cost.   Needless to say, my son and I were very pleased with the purchase and our overall experience at this dealership.  No high pressure, just straightforward and friendly people here, including the manager, whose name I did not get.   Most definitely worth the trip from the bay area.<//Text>

< Review>
I have inquired multiple times about a vehicle offered for sale on their website through both their own site and through third party sales listing sites and have not received any contact. They have refused to answer basic questions about the vehicle or even acknowledge my inquiry - very disappointing. If this is how they communicate with a prospective customer, I'd hate to think what the experience would look like after the fact.

I suspect I'm dodging a very bad experience...< /Review>

Never going back there and i advise you to look somewhere else. All lies. They sold us a van that they had turned of check engine light on it(it was a stored code for transmission). They told us our credit score was 680, but we received our paperwork from bank with credit score of 828. They had us sign paperwork for 9% apr but in reality after few days bank approved us for 3.4%. all they do is lie and fill tire shine all over the car to make it look they took care of it. Now i have to spend $3k to rebuild the transmission, needless to say engine oil was totally black when i replaced it. Save ur money and look somewhere else.< /text>

<Name>Carrie Holland<//Name><user_id>112293525473367280916< /user_id><response>None</response><Review>Very disappointed and still have thoasands of dollars on hold due to them changing their mind after signing and getting the keys. All because I'm temporarily on unemployment trying to go back to work soon but need a car before my job needs me back on. I mean cmon this pandemic has alot of us in a bad spot. The last thing I needed was to waste a day financing a vehicle just to be turned down. I shouldn't have left without getting a full refund but I was so disappointed and upset I had to leave. Now days later im waiting for my bank to clear the refund they finally returned after having to call the car lot and ask them again politely give me my money back. And now I have a few days left to find a car and hoping even if its last minute the money will be released so I can get one on time to go back to work. Worst experience ever.<//Review></record>

It’s been about a month since I purchased my car but I should’ve wrote this review sooner. All the negative reviews are true, your car starts having problems soon after buying. As soon as I drove off the lot, a “warning: malfunction” sign came up which didn’t the day I test drove. The next day I notice a speaker is blown, one of the buttons on the wheel doesn’t work, among numerous other things. Now there are cranks & noises when I drive. The cars are cheap for a reason, beware! They’ll tell you nothing’s wrong with it but that’s typical salesman lies</Text>

I would not recommend going here unless you live in Modesto. We live in atwater. We went there because we saw one of their cars on carfax.com. FYI, always check carfax online for their vehicles because the price on carfax was massively lower than the one physically on the car. The purchase process was fine. We got the insurance, but they said if there were any issues within 30 days to come see them. Sure enough the next day the check engine light came on and we called them. The next day we could bring it was that Saturday, but they don't do maintenance on Saturdays so we had to we had to cut out early from work on Monday in order to get there before they closed to drop it off. So they called the next day saying they had to order a part and we had to pick it up. So we did that. Then they said to bring it back Monday. So we did. However, there was miscommunication between their maintenance people and the sales people that told us that and we needed to bring it back the following Monday, not the Monday we brought it. We still don't have our car back. They keep pushing it back and back. And I always have to call them, they never call me back. We gave spent hours of time and a lot of gas going back and forth. It would've been more cost and time effective to just pay the deductible at a local shop and get it repaired under the insurance. We've barely had our car, and you know our first months payment isn't going to be any lower because of that. They haven't even offered like a gas card or something in apology. Utterly ridiculous. Terrible experience.</Review>

#1 car dealership in California. Very close to the Bay Area and best in the Central Valley. Highly recommend this place. Fred and Manny helped me to the maxx. Bought a 2015 Lexus GS 350 F Sport. The cheapest car at the time was $30,000 everywhere else. I got it for $27,999 with only 18,000 miles. Finance was quick. Salesman Mo has checked on me almost 3 times after purchase. I have referred 3 more customers since. This will be the biggest dealership in Modesto one day. Customer service and 100% honest people. Offered me food, water, and coffee while waiting for my car to be financed. Also keep in mind they will find the car you want. I asked for a Lexus with red interior, low miles, and a silver color and they made it happen. Thank you prestige. I’ll be back for my second car this coming December.</Text>

This is a horrible place.  I drove 2.5 hours after talking to them about a Jeep and when I arrived it was completely trashed. There were a lot of searches and dings all over it. I understand it was not a new vehicle but they should have a least mentioned the excessive wear and tear< /review>

<review>Went to check out a 2017 Dodge Durango that was listed for a great price. When we arrived we saw the vehicle very dirty and shows very heavy wear and tear for a 3 year old vehicle. Asked if they can do something on the price as the interior seats need work and right fender needed to painted. They declined to discount the Durango.Then we saw a 2019 Dodge Caravan. We test drove and vehicle ran very well.When we were getting out the vehicle we found the right rear quarter repaired by very poor workmanship. That tells me that they just trying to do cheap repair and dump the vehicle to the public. I do not recommend this dealership even the price are great.<//review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

<review>Prestige Auto Sales sold my family a 2017 Acura RDX on April 27th 2020. We were given a Carfax that had damage reported 4 separate times. I expressed my concern to our salesman at the time and he informed me and my husband that these were NOT accidents, that the vehicle had been in NO accidents. That this was a corporate vehicle and every ding or scratch from an employee was reported to their insurance resulting in the 4 damage reports on the Carfax report. The Carfax they provided us also stated no accidents. Fast forward to September 23, 2020 we go to trade this vehicle into a GMC dealership, for something smaller. The GMC dealership pulled the accurate Carfax report showing that this specific vehicle has been in 4 separate accidents, SEVERE accidents (including severity report). Prestige auto sales failed to provide me with an accurate Carfax, and were dishonestly representing the Acura RDX that we purchased for our family. We also took this vehicle to Certified Collision Center to have the vehicle inspected and the vehicle has damage to the radiator support, and is missing a plate that runs alongside the rear passenger door(which is to help stabilizes the door in case of impact) and the crash bar in the door was repaired incorrectly causing it to be compromised in safety. My 5 year old daughter has been riding in this vehicle for the last four months, and at this point this vehicle is unsafe and was sold unsafe. If you’ve purchased a vehicle from here, I recommend purchasing your own carfax and comparing it to the one they gave you at the time of purchase. They’ll be completely different and doctored. I recommend having your vehicle inspected to make sure there’s no hidden damage. They are scam artists!</review><Name>Sonja Wood<//Name>< date>

Went in looking for a car posted on their website. Was told it was sold the day before and was told to test drive a Nissan Sentra that was bought the day prior from auction that still had the paint from the auction and was extremely dirty inside and out. The car had a check engine light on as well. When I told the salesman that I wouldn’t be interested I was then shown a VW that was missing part of the passenger side mirror. Would not recommend this dealership.</text>

<text>So here’s an update on my experience. I had purchased a car and everything went great. unfortunately I was in an accident and that vehicle was totaled. I requested a refund for the 3rd party warranty that I had purchased and that process wasn’t going to well. However one of the managers settled that process quickly after seeing my frustrations and put me in another vehicle promptly.  The prices I’ve paid for both vehicles had positive equity upon purchasing and I will continue doing business with this establishment in the future< /text>< pics>

<Text>They sold me a 2019 Infiniti earlier this year, it had a low windshield washer fluid alert. I asked them to fill up the reservoir and they said they didn't have any fluid. I filled the reservoir a day later and within 2 days it was low again. Fast forward covid-19 and my procastinating I waited till June to take it to dealer.

< Review>
My name is Krystal and I purchased a 2018 Nissan Altima SV from this dealership and I have to say that I love my car. I was iffy at first when deciding to purchase a vehicle because let's face it,  I'm a female and can be taken advantage of. But let me just say these guys were great. My payments are low and the term is just right. From the salesman to the finance guys, the guys were just awesome. I would definitely purchase again. Thanks Pristege!!!!!<//Review>

Don't buy from this dealership. If you are a first time buyer, go with someone with a lot of experience. They tried to sell us a car that had been in an accident and denied it hadn't been in one. The bumper was not even aligned with the hood, it was clearly repainted, and there were deep marks on the door. They advertised the car online but kept it in the back. Never buy solo, first time buyers. Especially, not from here.</Text>

Shoutout to the entire Prestige staff for being so helpful in my finding a car. Shoutout to ABE! He was really nice and respectful when helping me out. He literally got me a very good deal on a 2016 vehicle. I left thinking like, man, that went smoothly. It was fast, easy, and efficient. I recommend it, and I don’t even usually leave reviews lol But yes, absolutely worth it. I’ll be going back for a trade in, believe that!< /Text>

This is the most unprofessional business I have ever had the displeasure of working with. It is a family owned and operated business, and none of them know the first thing about cars or car sales. Among many issues, the biggest was they ask me to give them a 200 cash deposit so they could buy exactly the car I wanted at the auction. They never called from the auction as they said they would. They bought two high mileage cars, way over budget and tried to get me to accept them. They thought I was dumb enough to sign the papers. The owner tried to convince me that 40,000 miles on a two year old car was normal. Everyone knows 12-15,000 miles per year is average. If you want an awful experience buying a car and want to pay too much for a car then shop here. I ended up going to Super auto sales and worked with JR. I highly recommend Super auto sales. Very professional and very easy experience.< /text>

I was told they would hold a car for me because I live far away and work during the week. So I was supposed to come in that weekend to buy it. They not only sold the car a few days after I called, but didn't even call to tell me. I had to call because I was going to ask about their financing. If I didn't call they would've let me drive 2 hours out there, one way, for nothing. Unprofessional, and obviously don't care about keeping their word.< /review>

These guys are the best!  I purchased my Miata RF from them just yesterday and could not be happier with the customer service I experienced throughout the whole process.  I was quite hesitant to fly all the way from SoCal to NorCal without seeing the car beforehand.  However, working directly with Able, he arranged for a detailed multi-point service check on my car thru the local Mazda dealership to ensure the car was in great condition and to give me confidence.  They also went above and beyond by picking me and my husband up the morning we flew into Oakland.  Jamal, our driver, even bought us our Starbucks as a nice gesture!  The official purchase process went smoothly and quickly, as they were great working together and arranging all the details over the phone the week leading up to us flying up there.  The car was just as described when we got there, they cleaned it up all sparkly, had both keys ready, and even filled up the gas tank!  If I could give them a higher review rating, I would!  Thank you Abe and Jamal for EVERYTHING!  I LOVE my new car and it would not have been possible to purchase my car long-distance without your over-the-top customer service!</text>

<Text>This establishment is a stain on the highlight of Modesto's Mchenry avenue which is of course the auto mall. This place however... well, where to begin? The sales people hunt you down and do not listen to what you're looking for. Its almost as if their superiors tell them "sell this car today" and thats how they treat you. Oh, did I mention the unwashed Volvo they tried to sell me still had a half full big gulp in the cup holder and trash in the floorboard? Yeah... stay away. Go to Roberts.<//Text><time>1518569555585< /time>< name>

< Review>
Bait and switch warning. I saw a Toyota Camry XLE online at a great price. I called to confirm that they had it in stock. I confirmed the price and that it was an XLE and the title was clean. I let them know I was 2 hours driving 2 hours. I got there and was tested by the guy I sooks to on the phone. He started by letting me know the car had been in an accident before they bought it. Would have been nice to know before but not a deal breaker. I got in and noticed it was missing some features common on the XLE like Moonroof and leather. He told me that it was an option in the model but not always present  on the XLE. I test drove it and when I got back he was trying to rush me in to make a deal. i walked around the car and there in the back it says SE, not XLE. Still he tries to tell me that what I found online was correct and he would give me a great deal. He tried to convince me that despite what it said on the back and though it was missing features, this was an XLE model. Rediculous. I wasted a vacation day, the money for a rental car and gas to drive 2 hours each way so they could bait and switch. Buyer beware.<//Review>

<review>I purchased a vehicle from this lot and may I say. They have a lot of cars. I spoke to a gentlemen named moe, the guy didn't even treat me like a customer. It was like I knew him forever. They aren't pushy and aren't forceful at all. Funny thing is that we seen the car we wanted was while we were at carmax across the street. So we went here. Great car buying expirince< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< time>

<Time>1527170906909</Time><rating>1< /rating><text>My inital visit to Prestige Auto was pleasant, albeit suspect. I got what I thought was a decent deal on my car (ignoring the fact that they didn't know what year it was until they printed off the paperwork, after which they told me that it was not a 2007 but rather a 2012) and was financed through them.
Upon leaving the dealership, I found that any bump in the road caused the car to swerve, so I alerted the dealership and they paid to "fix" it. The people at the repair shop told me that the last time someone repaired the suspension on the car, they repaired it incorrectly, and the car was actually missing a part. So much for their thorough pre-sale inspection, right? So whatever, they fix it and I'm fine with that.
Shortly after this, I take the car on a trip of 1500 miles, which shouldn't have been a problem for this car, as it was presented as being in such good condition. However, at mile 600, my car starts acting up on the freeway. I step out to see that both of my rear tires are completely bald and flat. I paid for a tow truck to take me in to the nearest town to get it checked out and repaired. When I go to pick up the car, he shows me that the suspension components are so weak that he's able to compress them completely with his bare hands. Thats strike 3 for Prestige.
Fast forward about a month, I haven't been billed a single payment for the car, and Prestige calls me up saying "Hey, we were able to get you a bwtter interest rate for the car, so we're gonna overnight you a new contract so you can make lower monthly payments. I'm stoked, so I agree. They send me the contract, I send it back, and await the first bill. Fast forward another month, and I get a call from the lender saying they can no longer honor the loan because they overnighted me the contract rather than having me fill it out on site. I call Prestige to ask what the deal is, they give me an "oh well" and start getting aggressive, saying I have to get the car back to them on my dime (no cheap feat, as I had moved to Texas for work). I decide to get aggressive back, and as soon as I threaten legal action, they're suddenly able to make a deal with me, where I go through a lender of my choice and have them send the money to Prestige.

So here's a recap:
1. Sold me an incorrectly-labeled car with poorly repaired suspension (negligent and dangerous)
2. Had my car repaired poorly which resulted in a middle-of-nowhere break down (expensive and dangerous)
3. Sent me a contract to sign at my residence, not realizing that this would, in fact, nullify the contract (negligent)
4. Blamed me for the loan falling through and aggressively pressured me to send the car back to them on my own dime (bad business practices)
5. Magically found a solution when I refused to back down and let them know what kind of legal resources I had at my disposal (lack of integrity)

All in all, I wish I had just sent the car back and that I had taken these guys to court to pay for the vehicle transport fees. I would die before I'd recommend Prestige Auto to anyone.<//text>< pics>

I WROTE A REVIEW 3 MONTHS AGO AS I WAS PLEASED TO HAVE GOTTEN MY NEW CAR. HOWEVER THE SAME DAY I GOT IT THE POWER STEERING LOCKED UP ON ME. BY IT BEING SOME TYPE OF ELECTRICAL POWER STEERING I HAD TO BRING THE CAR BACK TO GET IT FIXED BUT I HAD TO PAY FOR THE TOW AS WELL AS $92 FOR UBER BECAUSE I HAD MY FAMILY WITH ME AND WE HAD WENT OVER TO CONCORD AND THE TOW TRUCK COULDN'T FIT US ALL.  I WAS NOT REFUNDED BY PRESTIGE. NOT TO MENTION I WAS 7 MONTHS PREGNANT. NOW HERE I AM AGAIN AND THE WATER PUMP HAS GONE OUT. I SPOKE TO MO AND HE SAID THERE'S NOTHING THEY CAN DO. I HAVE ONLY HAD THIS CAR 4 MONTHS, MO SAID I DIDN'T HAVE A WARRANTY BUT THOMAS TOLD ME I DID. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS CAR DEALERSHIP BUT IF YOU DO GO IN THOMAS IS THE ONLY ONE THAT I WOULD RECOMMEND. THAT IS IF MO DOESN'T LIE AND SAY HE'S NO LONGER WORKING THERE TO GET A SALE. THEN AGAIN THOMAS MAY HAVE LEFT BECAUAE THW DEALERSHIP IS NOT REPUTABLE. MO IS ONE WHO IS A FAST TALKER, MANIPULATOR, AND LIAR, AND HE WILL CUT YOU OFF WHEN TALKING ANY CHANCE HE GETS. WHEN I FIRST CAME INTO THE DEALERSHIP I MET THOMAS HE WAS HONEST, HUMBLE, AND RESPECTFUL I TOLD HIM I'D BE BACK. WHEN I CALLED A COUPLE OF DAYS LATER AND ASKED FOR THOMAS I GOT MO AND HE SAID THOMAS NO LONGER WORKED THERE. THAT HAPPENED TO BE A LIE BECAUSE AFTER I CAME BACK AFTER THE POWER STEERING HAD GOTTEN FIXED THOMAS WAS THERE AND I TOLD HIM THAT I THOUGHT HE WAS NO LONGER WORKING THERE BUT HE HAD INFORMED ME HE WAS JUST OFF. THE PLACE WILL NOT BE IN BUSINESS LONG THE WAY THEY ARE OPERATING UNPROFESSIONALLY. HOWEVER AS I TOLD MO ALLAH IS ALL KNOWING AND THE BEST OF PLANNERS. AS WELL AS VENGEANCE IS MINE SAID THE LORD, KEEP SELLING THOSE CARS GETTING OVER ON PEOPLE NOTHING GOOD WILL COME FROM IT. PEACE BE WITH YOU ALL< /review>

This company will give you a car under the guise that they are "helping" you and then BREAK THE LAW by violating the CFCDA and FCDA. We agreed to pay them a down with our tax return though we weren't 100% sure when it would come in- and they claimed they understood and would "help us." Then they started harrassing us by SHOWING UP AT OUR HOUSE and threatening to show up at my husbands work, calling us sometimes upwards of 10 times per day, sending threatening messages that they would take our property- all of this is AGAINST THE LAW according to the CFCDA and FDCA. They are bullies, and were happy to take our rent money instead of WAIT for my return like they said they would. Along with that my car payment is over $100 more than they said it was, my back tire had to be replaced within a week, oil change had to be performed within a week and I had to wash and gas it up myself. Point blank this is NOT a reputable car sales company. My advuce? GO SOMEWHERE ELSE where they won't harrass you and break the law and pose as trying to help.</review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

I had the pleasure of working with Alex. She helped me swap devices. So easy to work with and extremely helpful. Please if you have Verizon go see Alex at the new serramonte location. If you don't go in and get set up with her.</Review>

<text>Staff wasn't very helpful the day I went to try to buy a SIM card for a Samsung tablet I got as a gift. I wanted to swap out the junky tablet I have (that I've been paying for mobile access for over three years). They said they didn't have any SIM cards to fit my tablet on hand and I'd have to go to the "Mission Street" store, yet when I asked where it was the four people working couldn't and didn't tell me where it was. If you're from San Francisco/Daly City you know how long Mission Street is. So much for customer service.<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1611161300501, 'text': "We're sorry you weren't able to purchase your SIM card, Luna.

<text>Completely closed during the pandemic while other comparable stores (AT&T) offered curbside pick up. Terrible customer service over the phone (hours of waiting and bouncing me around from one wrong number to the next and nobody being able to solve the problems I am experiencing with my phone). In addition, terrible connection to some cell phones international cell phones (this was unsolved too).< /text><userid>116003445228717350573<//userid></record>

Verizon trying to pretend it's an Apple store. Sales people are nice, but it is super irritating that they don't show any prices. You have to ask about each item separately. Do yourself a favor and shop online.<//review>

Waited for 30 mins, was told I was next on the app. Then proceeded to see 3 other people that came in after me being helped. Still waiting. Learn how to say no and tell people to wait like I did.< /Review>

At first it looked like everything was all good and smooth when we transferred from T-Mobile to Verizon, but things became more complicated when we never received a paper bill when we specifically said we don't want paperless bill. I only found out the bill because I got a text saying I'm late for the payment and have to pay late fees. Second problem is our bill is not what they told us. We should be under military discount for $30/line for 4 lines, but they charged us $35/line. They said they don't know anything since they're only sales associate, not a customer service. Not even the manager can help us fix these issues and said to talk to a customer service. When you ask them about these complicated things, they go straight to their excuse of "Idk I'm only a sales associate, call customer service," but when you go there to get a new service, they magically know all these things and start enticing you to get Verizon. Do not go here.< /review>

Great for seasonal items and has good produce the majority of the time. Employees are not that helpful; one time it took the check-out woman 45 mins to exchange 2 items and ring up the rest of my stuff. It only ever got done bc I told her manager how her math was messed up and made sure they got the right amount of money. (She was trying to give me the things back that I had exchanged, plus the new things I wanted instead.) After all that she ended up giving me too much change back. Wow!<//text>

Wish someone didn't put a huge dent in my poor little sun.  If it were a Cadillac, maybe it'd be worth running, but a Lil trailblazer?  Come on!  Shopping center VERY NICE :)</text>

<text>Love the 99 cent store. I frequently get my sugar fix here. Love the jelly belly bellyflops. They have lots of selections at very reasonable prices for the sweet tooth. I like to purchase my preserves for my toast here also. The apricot jam and blackberry jam are awesome on toasted sourdough bread with a hot cup of coffee. If you know what you want and go right to it you're in and out in no time. There are also several good places to eat.<//text><resp>None<//resp><Pictures>None<//Pictures><rating>5<//rating><username>Steven Mack< /username>< GmapID>

<review>Nice new Center but too many loud, noicy teenagers hanging around, abusing the public outdoor furniture. Parking spaces are not enough. Forsee this center would be deteriorating rapidly. The prices at B.F. are outrageously and ridiculously high.<//review>< Rating>

When I first starting attending Grace Chapel, I found the people to be very loving, accepting, and friendly. The teaching is absolutely phenomenal. I've heard sermons for over 20 years of my life and the pastors manage to include points I've never considered before. The teaching is verse by verse and we go through books of the Bible at a time and I love how nothing is left out. The worship is great and engaging. There are tons of ministry opportunities to be involved in and I find it very rewarding to know that I am serving and helping people. God's love is truly evident in this church and He is sustaining it. This year marks the 100th birthday of Grace Chapel and I think that's a huge testimony of God's love for His people and His provision :)< /Review>

You can talk to him and confide one's issues and problems. For me personally, he has become the face of Grace Chapel and I am fortunate and blessed to have met him and call him a friend. I wish him, his family, and the other folks he touches with his kindness that they continue to walk in god's light.

There is so much to say about the wise Pastors/leadership of excellent character, the heart behind the music, the exaltation of Jesus/Gospel/Bible, the many ways to get plugged in, Neighborhood Impact and other community involvement, the Youth Ministries with great priorities and their heads screwed on straight, the ability to walk past classes only to hear beautiful young voices quoting Scripture.

Christ knows the imperfection in each of the people who attend here... but He loves them anyways.  I am so thankful for the grace shed upon this church and you may meet some of the most gracious people in your life, but you are guaranteed to meet some of the most redeemed people of your life.<//Text>

I always come to this Church when I am back in town. The leader and lay persons are commited to sound biblical teaching based on good exegesis from the word of God and use that to determine the songs that are sung.</review>

The pizza was dry barely had sauce the pepperoni was undercooked and burned on the edges. The crust was burned. We ordered the garlic tusken and the sundried tomatoes tastes disgusting.

<review>Cold and probably some of the worst pizza I've had. Feel bad for giving it 1 star, so they got 2 lol 😂<//review></record></dataset><record>
<Review>This was my first time eating here, the crust was under cooked, their was little to no sause, bearly enough cheese to cover the pizza, but it had alot of pepperoni and they were crunchy which i appreciated that. Their was more crust then anything else, and since it was under cooked it didn't leave a good taste especially with the limited amout of sauce and cheese. I've never seen a pizza cut the way they do it, its an interesting gimmick, i wont go to this location if i order from this company again.  I bought a large pepperoni pizza, its cost was 21 and some change, the size looked more like a medium to me, i would have priced it $10 or $13 dollars at most, the amount you get and the amount of effort they put in to make these is not worth $21, as I'm typeing this my stomach is auctally starting to hurt, becareful when eating here.<//Review>< user>

<rating>5</rating><Text>always have great quality pizza. we order regularly and choose the contactless delivery option. yes it’s pricier than dominos and Pizza Hut (which is pretty much pizza fast food), but you get a pizza that is well cooked, a lot fresher and higher quality toppings/Ingredients and just better customer service overall every time. very consistent. This goes for the franchise as a whole. I know what I’m getting when I place my order and never have to worry. Thanks guys<//Text><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

<text>The pizza was pretty good, but the prices for two pizzas and some wings were 70 bucks, and that's with us picking it up, and the wings for a pound were almost 20 bucks, so if you dont mind paying top dollar for decent pizza, this place is for you. And even after spending 70 bucks on pizza, I still got charged 50 cents a pop for ranch, crazy.</text><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

just ordered for my crew on site. overpriced, undersized. kind of an overated dominos. its not bad taste but $20 for a 14" pie is nuts. its edible but def not a $20 pizza. i might be jaded being from the east coast where real pizza exists. next time we order from dominos, at least we know were getting hosed. it was ready and hot, but they had no plates to send out. no plates on a $300+ order? stated there is a plate shortage, first ive heard of this one.<//Review>

<review>The pizza is deceiving. Presentation can only go so far. Although with parmesan cheese and crushed red pepper its eatable alone it isn't all that. The wings however had an amazing traditional buffalo wing taste. So if you like the baked wings instead of the crispy fried type your in luck.. quality cheeses fresh sauce and a more cared for dough would do this place justice.< /review>< Pics>

One of the cleanest salad bars I've ever seen they work very hard to keep a place clean pizza subs X1 salad bar foods good but I'm very partial to salads they do well.
Great selection, no skimping, manager checks on guests personally. Parking is good, big vehicle access and parking in back less than 100 yard walk. NOT A TRUCK STOP, but a nice shopping center. UPS store (other side of grocery store). South east corner, south bound side of Euclid, facing east.</text>

They are doing a special for Halloween that if your kid comes dressed up in costume you get a FREE personal pizza for each one! I just bought a salad and drinks to round it off and had a cheap lunch for my boys. They have it decorated for Halloween so my little ones loved that.

I ordered a medium and waited 50 minutes until i got my pizza while multiple  people came and left. I asked for it well done and finally after the long wait, my pizza was absolutely cold. EXTREMELY  disappointing!!!!!!< /Review>

The pizza and wings were delicious. The Pepperoni's are smaller but are packed with a lot more flavor than most. As for the service we had no problems. We ordered a pizza and small order of wings to go. It was ready on time.<//text>

First time eating here and I would have to say that it will not be my last. The Pizza was refreshing and unique in ways that did not to seem to mimic neighboring franchises. The lunch special selection was not too vast; however being as it was lunch it was more than enough to satisfy my appetite.</Review>

Mountain Mike's has always been great pizza. Fresh vegetables and meats. The crust is crispy on the bottom, light and soft throughout. My favorite pizza. No cardboard taste. A little pricey, but in my opinion worth it. Staff at this one was very friendly and helpful. When I have the chance, I will go back.</review>

<Review>Have been here a number of times now and I just feel it gets better every time I go. Today was no exception. The clean look in the store makes it nice to come to also the wonderful smells coming from the kitchen. They were just cleaning up with the lunch buffet which happens Monday thru Friday from 11am to 2 pm. The staff member came over with a friendly attitude and took our order. We started our order with and order of garlic sticks with cheese. There is 12 nice size pieces with a nice garlic flavor and not overly cheesy and came with a nice cup of the pizza sauce to dip them in (actually the cup of pizza sauce came with at least two cups). We then added two large pizzas, the first was the specialty pizza called Pike's Peak. This is an all meat combination loaded with mounds of pepperoni, sausage, beef, salami, lingucia and ham. The second pizza consisted of pepperoni, ham and mushrooms. Both pizzas we're loaded with a load of toppings. The pizzas were very tasty and filling they are never worried about you going home hungry and usually you go home with leftovers which our just as good the next day.  The slices are a nice size and you can see the pleasure they put into each pizza. If you looking for good pizza this is definitely a great place to go and enjoy the atmosphere and great food you can't miss out.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None<//Response><GmapID>0x80dcccadccbeb281:0x2d5520215b70760d<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Awesome salad bar...I especially enjoyed the sun-dried tomatoes!  Pizza is out of bounds!  Lots of different toppings and sauces... tomato, BBQ and a really amazing white sauce, which really brings out the flavor of more delicate toppings, like mushrooms. I did not try the wings, mainly because I ran out of room in my stomach! If you like pizza, Daniel and his crew have it going on!< /Text>

Really polite servers. We enjoyed eating here. All sorts of styles up on the buffet. Thumbs up for quality. ☺ The only thing was that we had to keep going up and asking for new plates to get things off the buffet. Other than that, I gave 4:5 stars to this pizza place. 👍</Text>

The pizza here is pretty good. They're not shy with the toppings and they aren't that pricey. The customer service is great. The staff are really friendly and seen genuine.< /Review>

<text>This pizza it so good!!! It's thick and if you get the mountain size it's huge! My favorite part about it is the pepperoni!! The pepperoni is like no other! They are a bit smaller and they curl upward in the oven, the result it crunchy and delicious pepperoni that you start craving days later.< /text><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

Just got my lame pizza... I ordered pepperoni, ham, and mushrooms on a large pie and the cheese didnt cover the whole pie and the pepperoni is super thin and very small. The mushrooms were canned and there were only 12 mushrooms on the whole pie... And 4 of the pieces had no ham on them... Dont waste your time or money...  $30 for a pizza thats half there isnt worth it... Ill give them that delivery was fast... Well of course there was only half of the topping... Very unhappy... Dont bother... You shouldnt be able to see the crust thru the cheese...< /Text>

<text>Food was good, service was very good. The girl behind the counter was very sweet and very accommodating. I attempted to go to this place twice prior. The first time they did not honor the Groupon, second time they were closed due to change of ownership process. Third time was a charm and overall I was pretty happy. Don't know however if I'd jump at the opportunity for another Groupon though.<//text>< pics>

Not impressed at all.  This was my first time here.  The pie was not good, not great, just ok. Decent amount of topping not to much sauce the price got me! $27 for a large 3 topping. It was a $15 pizza tops.<//text>

<rate>5<//rate><text>(Translated by Google) I was about to give a 3-star rating because the truth was that I dumped a wastebasket on the tables, the people seemed to make a table of their personal wastebasket, everything they vacated, they put it on the other table and look, they did not clean that much, it was already giving me much to think about. But when I tried the pizza, it was very tasty, it is very rich ... it is very well prepared. The only thing a little more cleaning

Estaba apunto de dar una calificación de 3 estrellas porq la verdad avia un tiradero en las mesas la personas parecía que hacían  de una mesa su basurero personal todo lo q desocupaban lo ponían en la otra mesa y mire q no limpiaban tanto eso ya me estaba dando mucho q pensar. Pero cuando probé la pizza m gusto mucho es muy rica ..esta muy bien preparada. Lo único un poco de mas limpieza</text><username>fati Cervin<//username>< Pics>

Was told when i asked that it's $25 for a set of acrylic nails it even says it on the board but got charged $45, when i said i was told $25 they didn't seem to care. The girls working the front are like 13 and don't know what they are doing or how to talk to customers. Nice nails, but not going somewhere that posts the wrong price and doesn't care about customer service.<//text>

<text>Best place I've been to. This is their current and new location with brand new equipment too. Doesn't get any better than this. Make sure to make an appointment because they are always in demand for good reason. I travel from the other end of the valley just to get my nails done here.</text>< Pictures>

I am very disappointed with there customer service and the quality of work. I am particular with my nails because I do not mind paying more for quality nails but, in this case I should have just bought press on nails. I asked for coffin shaped nails and my nails are not even, some look round in comparison to others. Some nails have more acrylic then others and the nail polish came off that same day. As for the female that did my nails, she was rude and had no crisma. She cut me twice and  laughed at the situation, a simple sorry would have been nice. I would never recommend getting your nails done here but, if you must please go with one of the males they seemed to be kind to there customers.<//Text>

<text>I went to get my eyebrows done here today and they weren't even and they looked very different from each other,  I clearly expressed that I was NOT happy with the result of my eyebrows. They wanted to fix them however the way that she was going to fix was to make them too thin. In the end I still had to pay for something I wasn't satisfied with and paid $11 to basically get my eyebrows ruined.  I went to Fancy Nails in Coachella with Hanna who fixed my eyebrows. I wil never go to anyone else for my eyebrows.<//text>< Pics>

<Review>I've been coming here for about 4 months already. Nicole and Tony are the best! I no longer go to the previous nail salon I was going for almost 6yrs bc of their lack of customer service. I'm glad my friend recommended Wonder nails. This place is always clean and very attentive. It's best to schedule an appt or call before you go in. They're always very accommodating. I've waited a couple times and understand they're busy. They all do a great job and don't rush to get people in and out quick. I looooove coming here.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><gmap_id>0x80daf82f6ab4d495:0xc187692606676e70</gmap_id></record>

However, they do provide a fantastic shopping experience. You browse their app/ catalogue, you order online and relax. If you subscribe to Prime, most stuff is shipped for free and often arrives within 24 hours. When it arrives at the Hub Locket, you get a confirmation email with a barcode. Hop on the bus, 15 minutes to USC campus (for me).
When you enter the Hub there is an array of lockers. You click a button on the email you received on your cellphone which generates a QR code and tells you which locker your items are in. Place your phone against a scanner, the locker door slides open and that's it! Painless. You can take up to 15 days before you retrieve your package if necessary. There is an attendant if you have any problems as well.<//Review><response>None< /response></record>

Best place to pick up your packages. The place is clean and organized. The employees are beyond friendly. Amazon follows the covid-19 guidelines. Parking validation as well...even though 75% of the time, parking is free for everyone. If you have a lot of packages, the employees will let you borrow their Amazon cart.< /Review>

You will have to get to the other side of the building by a restaurant Dulce. Then Don't be surprised if your code doesn't work. The code only lasts 15 minutes... so you pretty much have to generate a code then and there before you can unlock the locker. Luckily there is a helpful staff there telling you about this - saving grace. The rest is a piece of cake. Don't say I didn't tell you with this review.</text>< Pics>

HOWEVER, if you are dropping off your Amazon returns here, keep in mind it takes FOREVER for Amazon to process the return/refund!
Unlike Kohl's and UPS drop off which refund would be processed the same day or next day once you dropped off your return.
I dropped off my return here for more than TWO WEEKS and still waiting for the return to be processed at return center and refunded.
I chatted with Amazon twice and the first representative asked me to wait for two weeks from the return drop off date. After 16 days, NOTHING (no email). Chatted with them again and this time they told me TWO WEEKS PLUS 7 BUSINESS DAYS! I have NEVER wait for that long for Amazon return/refund!</Review>< pics>

Mostly I use the Amazon hub for returning items not having them delivered there to pick them up. The thing that makes it so convenient now is you don't have to print out return labels or anything.  They send you a barcode you take in, preferably on your cellphone, the personnel their scans the barcode and then you just give them the merchandise. I've had the money credited back to my account within 2 days instead of having to wait one to two weeks.  This is much faster than return by mail.< /Text>

<Review>Nice 0lace.   I was able to drop off a return package I already had a UPS label for, and I had the refund by the time I got home.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

Very convenient location specially for USC students. I drive all the way down from Glendale and dropped off a return. Otherwise it would have cost me over $15. Getting in and out of the mall that the locker is in is very quick and easy. There’s a Trader’s Joe right next door that makes getting a snack and do your grocery shopping at the same time.< /text>

Google sends you down McClintock. Stay on Hoover. That's where the entrance for the parking is.< /Review>

Easy in + easy out. Parking is quick to find in their underground facility. And they validate so no stress. Lots of big elevators which take u up near the store. If u are carrying a heavy item, don't worry as it's only 20 paces from elevators. Helpful staff. Pick up lockers. Return drop off too with box tape to seal up your shipment. Ask staff for a box of u need one for returns.  Bonus: Trader Joe's is right by the elevators too.  I'm just saying...</Review>

Very confusing on exactly where it is no map or sign pointing to it.
When you pull up front there's a small gate you will enter walk down to the center court yard make a left past a little cafe and it's to your left.
Went straight to locker scanned the barcode package came out.
I had mixed emotions about everything after that. I was mad at the directions but happy to get my package.<//Review>

This is a self service Brick and Mator location. Really simple and easy to return your items. You print out your return label and use the plastic bags provided for you. Drop in mailbox 📬. Easy Peasy.< /Text>

I had to start receiving my amazon packages here due to some issues in my apartment complex. I definitely love this instead, I feel my packages are safer here then anywhere else. Friendly employees, and I mean there is a target, and a Trader Joe’s too, win-win for me!<//review>

Best thing ever. Don’t have to worry about having my packages lost or stolen now. Easy to use and its just down the street at the new village with 2hr free parking 🙌🏻.  The only thing is wish they had some sort of after hours service to make grabbing your packages if you cant make it there before they close</Text>

<review>Pretty cool and easy way to get packages from Amazon. Pros its location is in a very safe area so I didn't feel unsafe retrieving my items. The cons were that it was somewhat difficult finding the actual location since its inside the USC plaza/shopping square. I also felt out of place since everyone else that was there was a student.< /review>< userid>

<Text>It's inside the plaza near Target.
So Google maps will just say
" Your destination is to the Left, (or Right.. depending on which direction you come from.) And you look to the Left and see just a huge Wall.

No need to panic, it's on the other side of the wall. Park on the street or if the gate is open, ask the fine Gentelman with the clipboard if you can just run in to get your package 😉.< /Text>< Response>

Convenient location , parking structure below, the last time I was there I helped a young lady tape up her box. She didn't know how to use a tape gun. I was surprised how many guys (males) didn't help her since she was struggling holding and taping the box at the same time. When I was finally helped with my package pick up I went to her taped up her box and left. It was pathetic that no one helped her and then I realized probably none of those guys knew how to use a tape gun either. So sad......<//Review>

I went to the hub to return a whiskey still.  It was easy  to print the return label Amazon emailed me and it turned out it kept me from standing in line.  When the associate looked up and saw the labeled box she told me I could just put it on the counter and I was good to go.  In and out the way I like it.  Great job, Amazon!</review>

< Review>
I like the convenience of having to pick up packages at the Amazon Hub Locker and never had any real issues other than parking woes, except one day when it was the 15th day (last day) to pick up a package—which had arrived late and couldn’t pick up because of my crazy work schedule, plus I had gone out of town for the holidays—and literally find out at around 8:30 pm that they have a cutoff time of 8:15 pm and I could no longer pick up my package. Nowhere on the Amazon order (neither online nor on the app) does it say that they have a cutoff time to pick up a package on the last day. No supervisor on duty on the weekends to help me out.

I ended up filing a complaint to Amazon and had to reorder the item, plus they gave me additional $10 credit for my troubles. When they say that something can be picked up on a certain date, this facility needs to abide by that and not make the consumer pay the price. Hopefully this facility will either change their practices or Amazon needs to disclose a cutoff time, if any.< /Review>

Parking lot is always chaotic and there are millions of people everywhere. Unless you are already here for something else do not have your packages shipped here. Other than that it's very nice and clean and new and the people working the counter  are very nice.</Review>< pictures>

This place is always busy. Tip is to park in the underground parking located under target. If you have multiple packages they will loan you a dolly which was super helpful!< /Review>

Do not use this locker. It will take a while to get "able to pickup code" due to their backlog. Secondly there is no parking around this USC building. Worse locker to pick unless you are. USC student or work in the building.< /text>

Pretty easy to use, mostly automated. Park in the deck but bring your stub with you as there is a machine at the counter that scans your stub and validates! They also have shipping supplies and tape available there. Good place to pick up a package if you live on campus or nearby.< /Text>

They have the packing supplies for return of the small items and bin to dispose of boxes and stuff. The staff is not looking over your back to help you so you might get lost a bit. But there's a person at the counter you could go and get help. It's a location where you can freely return or pickup items. as you please<//text>

Love this place it makes it so much better than having a porch bandit take your package from your house
And most of all there really is no waiting just get your code after you park this way by the time you hit Amazon your code will be on your phone. Scan your phone and the locker pops open and off you go and even better if you have anything you need to return to them you can do it here and the best thing is you get your refund with in a day if not that same day<//text>

Very poorly signed location. I went around for 6 to to find parking to drop off return. Ended gave up dropping off there. Better watch out for student pedestrians, walk signal lights are meaningless to them. I regretted to choose this location to return. It's like hitting a jack pot to find street parking in 3 block radius, even though there are plenty. All packed. Bad, busy, poorly signed location.<//Review>

<Review>Heads up: parking entrance is off Hoover, not McClintock. The staff was very helpful. I was there to return a couple items, but foolish me didn't print up all the return labels. She directed me to the kiosks where I was able to print up the remaining label. They had tape that I used to take the box and affix the label I printed up from home. After she scanned it, I got a confirmation email in about 10 minutes. It was really convenient!</Review>< pictures>

< Review>
The University Village has potential. What's hindering it is that there's a lot of stores that aren't open yet and a lot of empty store spaces. The ones that are available provide a lot. Most of the restaurants are pricey. There's a couple that are reasonable. There's always lots of parking it's underground. You get either one hour if you shop at one of the places, or two hours if you go to a restaurant. There's a large grassy area to play with in the front and even larger one in the back.< /Review>

I like that I can have large packages delivered. Sometimes getting into the parking structure can be challenging but at least you can get 2 hours free parking with validation.< /review>

So easy to go pick up stuff. The staff was really nice too! Great to go to since it has an extended time of pick up availability in comparison to other lockers.<//text>

Whoever invented this is pure genius a place where you pick up your packages from Amazon I love it I always had problem with my mail carrier or my pesky neighbors rambling through my mail and ends up being a no-show not anymore I get every package now because I pick it up myself it is very simple and convenient all you have to do is get your barcode from your package wait a couple of minutes to get the Locker number scan it and your package is yours too simple too easy can't get no better than this nothing's like something being delivered at your front door but still I like this better because of the environment that I live in not so great when it comes to packages. And don't even worry about paying for parking they validate it for you.<//Text>

They say a package is delivered under Your Orders but when you go to pickup they tell you it’s not available to pickup on weekends. So if you have package delivered late Friday through Sunday don’t expect to be able to pick it up. Amazon needs to update their system to reflect this or have US Postal service deliver directly to the Amazon address at USC instead of to USC main building.< /text>

<review>I dropped off a big return here...and it was never processed.  I never got my refund.  I spent a good deal of time with customer service and they kept telling me if I dropped it off, tracking would work...  but once i dropped it off...I am now relying on the amazon employees to scan and process my return right???  So who's really responsible at this point?  And where is my money...This is so frustrating...unfair, and just straight up rude that I have to explain everything over and over again to someone who doesnt really understand the situation in an online chat.  I eventually got my money back through customer service but this shouldnt be happening like this.</review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

<Text>(Translated by Google) Original. Inside the university campus. Very clean, nice area. Parking on the street with parking meters. The area is very safe. Nearby is target and trades jones. Local is small but nice easy access, you just show the barcode of your phone's message on a scanner and immediately the mailbox is opened without touching anything you take out your package. Be safe.
