< Review>
We've been there 3 times. Each time we ordered some hours before via phone or website. The first time our order got cancelled on a very short notice. The second time they completely forgot to prepare our order. They didn't have enough bagels (at 11am!!!) to prepare it on spot. The third time we finally got the bagels, but when we arrived we were told, that they don't have the açaí bowl.
Moreover the service was not friendly. When entering the door they were shouting that they ran out of bagels. We felt like they just wanted to clean up and call it a day.
The only reason why I gave two stars is because the bagels are actually good!< /Review>

Best Bagels! Newly renovated & renamed from Bojour Bagel, but still the same great bagels. We do miss the small homey feel from when Lee & her husband were there. They were sooo awesome!<//text>

If you want your order to be totally wrong and take more than 30mins to receive, well you have to come to right place :) ! I told myself I wasn’t coming back but I was given a card FREE BAGEL for the inconvenience.  Big mistake again, the experience was terrible so I won’t be returning.  Which sucks because I like their bagels but not worth me leaving mad.</review>

Nice bagel cafe in La Mirada. The Signature 421 coffee is amazing and they have free samples. The Bagels are fresh, but you better come early because they’ll sell out!!! The display is full of bagels from savory sweet like chocolate chip, red velvet, cinnamon glaze, cheese type like Asiago, Parmesan, jalapeño, wheat, garlic, onion, sesame, everything, blueberry and many more. Mostly all gone by 11:30-12. Great spot has WiFi, a work space area and a corner for kids go play in.</text>

< Review>
Came over here when we found an hour wait at ihop across the parking lot. I love bagels and these are delicious. Soft and chewy on the inside and a nice crust on the outside. The  people behind the counter were nice and had good customer service. No blueberry bagels, so that was a disappointment to my husband. The store seems a bit clustered with boxes and cases of juice out in the open. Overall, I would definitely come back.<//Review>

First off, the bagels are amazing & the bagel sandwiches are delicious!!! Their coffee is good, but not very strong. The place itself is cute and cozy but often cluttered with boxes. I highly recommend visiting this hidden gem!!!</Text>

Chocolate chip bagel was delicious, and the cream cheese is good too. My favorite place to get a bagel.</review>

Rude & Discriminative .. My pet application was denied when i sent all possible documents & resubmitted my application when the owner told me to try again . My spouse & i drove over an hour to their open house to find a pet we even sat an extra two hours after open house to be ignored & given the run around for a dog in which we wanted to adopt .This place is a red flag from their lack of professionalism to how they treat people , I was so excited about this foundation but seeing how they treat military families they’ve lost my respect

The owner loves to respond to the lower google ratings with false information , to avoid her reputation of this foundation being tarnished. This place is horrible go here for a dog & you’ll see all the low google ratings and reviews left for this place is true< /text>

<resp>{'time': 1618922410834, 'text': 'Our Open Houses are open to the public every Saturday & Sunday from 10am-1pm. Anyone is welcome to choose to attend whether they have or have not been approved to adopt a dog.\n\nWhen this couple chose a dog they would like to adopt, they tried submitting their application at Open House. Here is our communication:\n\n“ Hi Candace and Keishaye,\n\nThank you for visiting Frosted Faces and your interest in Jock.\nWe know you are in the process of moving and would prefer for your family to wait until you are fully settled before bringing home a Frosted Face.\n\nOur typical process is to have you complete your home inspection and then we schedule time for you to meet the dogs after that.\nOur Open House program is intended to help introduce families to dogs and our hikes to help exercise them, but we require an appointment for adoptions and your complete home inspection process must be done before then. At this time, your home inspection is not complete as your home is still in the process of being set-up.\n\nWe are unable to move forward with your application.\nPlease also note that we are not hosting our hike today and you must complete a volunteer application and sign-up in advance as a volunteer.\nIf you were interested in volunteering at future events, you can complete an application here:\nhttps://frostedfacesfoundation.org/volunteer\n\nThank you for understanding, ”\n____________\n“ Hi Shaye,\n\nThank you for sharing some photos of your home. I realize you are in the process of moving, but we do need to see photos of your actual space set-up with your furniture (even if you are still in the process of moving) rather than realtor photos.\n\nCan you please share those when you get home today? Once we review them, we would be happy to reschedule time for you to meet Jock without your partner.\nBut we do need to see actual photos of your space set up for you and your family.\n\nThank you, ”\n————\nAs the couple continued to pressure us, an Adoption Coordinator responded, “ Hello Shaye and Candace,\n\nThank you for coming in to visit with us and your interest in Jock.\nWe understand you are excited to bring a dog home. But after further consideration, we will not be able to move forward with your application.\nI am sorry to share disappointing news. I would encourage you to look for a companion at a rescue like the Humane Society in San Diego.\n\nThank you for understanding, ”'}</resp>< Gmap_id>

This is a great dog rescue focusing on older dogs.  We have fostered a husky from here while on quarantine and loved her.  After she got adopted she got returned for being "too affectionate".  I was back at work and couldn't foster her but they still let me take her for the day on weekends.< /text>

As I read the bad reviews I think to myself  that some people will complain over the slightest slight.  Managing a not for profit is difficult and it is not about your feelings.  It is about the fur babies, making sure they are loved and giving them the best life possible in the time they have left.

My husband and I have 8 small dogs and a turtle all adopted all living their best lives.  Our beloved Lucky passed yesterday.  This morning my husband said "I feel like I need another dog."  Hopefully one of our rescue will be reaching out to us and asking if we are ready to adopt again.  The dog chooses us.

Peace and love and don't take things so seriously.<//Review>

<Review>Frosted faces is an amazing place. They take in elderly dogs and care for them as there own. In a normal shelter these dogs might be put down because of there age.

I applaud this organization for the care they give there senior dogs.
But the way they treat potential adopters horrific!  No communication, no respect, regard for potential adopters.  The place is disorganized.  No one knows why you are there.
When you do ask questions about a dog no one can give you answers.
I was going to adopt a dog with a disability and had concerns about house training.
Valid and responsible concerns.
They rejected my application because of these concerns.
I was heartbroken.
This disabled dog could have been in a loving forever home, but instead because of a house training concern I was denied!!!
It’s just wrong!< /text>

{'time': 1603051746813, 'text': 'Hi Deana,\nI’m sorry you’re disappointed with your experience. It’s seems counterproductive to write a review about a dog shelter trying to help place animals discouraging people not to adopt.\n\nIt sounds like you came to FFF during Open House when all of the public is invited. It is busy, which is such a great thing for a senior dog shelter, wouldn’t you agree? At the time, staff was also pulled away helping an owner find their lost dog. We are sorry we could not address you immediately.\n\nBoth a Kennel Manager who cares for Chopstix and knows our policies, and Chopstix’s foster spent time with you discussing his needs. Staff reported that your character and expectations did not align with our mission which is why you were declined. It is admirable that you desired to give Chopstix a home.\n\nWe hope you find another dog to provide a home.'}< /Resp>

<text>It's rare for me to give a five star review but I think the whole experience of interacting with FFF was truly amazing. From the initial emails/phone calls to my visit and adoption, everyone I came into contact with were amazingly nice and supportive and more importantly for me............patient!! I honestly didn't know what I was looking for or what I would find but adopting Oscar has been the highlight of 2020. I'm thankful that FFF rescued him and so many others; so many wonderful dogs need homes and I'm over the moon I got to adopt one of them. Don't be scared to adopt a senior dog!!! They will give you so much joy and love.</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

I have forever fostered two dogs with this organization so far. They were very supportive and truly care for each and every animal that comes into their care. I've read some negative reviews. One thing I will say, they are very selective about who fosters and adopts. These animals have been through a lot. They are vulnerable and many have health issues due to their age and/or previous treatment. The last thing FFF wants is to put these animals in the wrong home...again. Some may take this scrutiny personally, but I understand how necessary it is. FFF is there to advocate for the animal, not to try and "sell" you...so while the animals get the red carpet (they literally drive hundreds of miles and spend thousands of dollars to rescue these seniors), they may not roll it out for you. It's not personal, you are not the priority. And please keep in mind that most of the people you are interacting with are volunteering! If you care about their mission, then you will understand and share in their priorities (and give them a little leeway on human customer service). The FFF community is amazing...and the loving homes that these animals find for their final days is so heartwarming. I'm so glad FFF exists and would vouch for their integrity 100%.< /Text>

<Review>I had a previous bad experience with this rescue but put it aside because I understand we all have bad days and that I was adopting a dog and not the rescue. Other than adopting two amazing dogs, my second experience with them was even worse.

First, I adopted my dogs outright. That means I am responsible for all their costs. However, on the FF Facebook page their adoption announcement was accompanied by a request for monthly “sponsorship”. Since I’m responsible for their costs this confused me so I asked. I was told that this money would go to a general fund and not for these two dogs in particular. I pointed out that this was misleading and was told “Anyone who signs up as a fan is able to get more information from our website about the program and what being a fan entails.” So you need to go to another site and read the fine print to know that you are not actually supporting the dogs your “sponsoring “, which people clearly aren't doing based on the comments to the post.

I was also told that they "don't include that information in every social media post just because it would likely start to be redundant".  Putting aside that I would rather be redundant than misleading, I proposed to them that they simply change the language from a request for sponsorship to one asking for to help recover the costs spent for the dogs, to help with potential medical emergencies, and to help other senior dogs in need.  No response.

The adoption contract has clauses in it that muddy the ownership status of the adopter. For example, it requires that microchips  be registered with FF as the primary contact. Microchip registration serves as proof of ownership since dogs are viewed as property under the law. Also,  if something happens to my dogs I need to wait for FF to contact me because my dogs microchip only allow one contact.

I’ve fostered for many other rescues and generally dogs will get a dental before they’re adopted. FF did not and would not contribute to the cost,  so the cost of it fell entirely to me while FF is soliciting “sponsorship “ for them.  And frankly, putting senior dogs under anesthesia twice (they would eventually need dentals and were already scheduled for other surgeries) is not optimal.

Equally disingenuous was their statement in their adoption post indicating that it had been their intention to keep the dogs as a pair. That couldn’t be farther from the truth. I was interested in one and requested more information. Was not told about the other. When I requested more information I read that he had come in with another dog. I asked to meet them both. When I went to meet them both I as clearly told that they didn’t have to be adopted together. It was me, not FF, who insisted they stay together. FF does do amazing things, but they shouldn’t be  taking credit for something  they very much did not do.

As to their awareness of medical issues, one of my dogs came with a nasty case of worms despite having been at FF for some time. The other dog, who had been picked up as a stray with her, but who spent a longer time in a shelter, did not. Since they were found together they would have eaten there same things and been in the same places, so they should have both had worms. My guess is that the shelter did notice his worms and treated them before releasing him.

In addition, they were aware that I was moving out of SD but couldn’t get an appointment for the dogs mass removal until a week before. No one mentioned to me that her stitches would need to be removed a week to 10 days later, when I was in a new home and far from a vet I knew. Luckily I  had experience with mass removals, but what if I hadn’t? That’s putting the dogs in a precarious position.  Another way to put senior dogs in a precarious position is to set them up for needing to undergo anesthesia twice- they were already scheduled for surgery so it makes sense to do the dentals at the same time.

Overall, this has been an extremely disappointing experience. If you want to adopt a senior dog I strongly recommend Lionel’s Legacy.<//Review><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None</Resp><Gmap_id>0x80dbe8dc94db467d:0x206ccb2aa6c6615d< /Gmap_id></record>

<text>The most amazing, dedicated, compassionate, caring, respectful, professional rescue I've ever come across or dealt with. I admired FFF for a long time, and used them as inspiration in the rescue work I do in my own area. Not too long ago, one of their adoptables caught my eye as the one I knew I needed to have (deep down I want them all, but I am in a condo in Canada lol). We applied for her and they made it work for us to adopt from them all the way up in Canada!! They were just amazing to deal with, and it's not hard to tell they are all in it for the right reasons. I will forever support and love this rescue.<//text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPo-yPXtAjpijc3pJ3npVutR0Dji1TJHvJmvBU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMnYfncht54VJGsWItEfNYsStAIv2m4F3Dsp2Q=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics>< response>

I started volunteering at Frosted Faces last April. Right away I was impressed with how much the rescue coordinators and volunteers care about rescuing senior dogs and cats, and giving them their best life no matter how long it may be. Frosted Faces is an actual home that has been modified to be a safe, animal friendly facility. The kennels are cleaned multiple times daily, and there are 7 play yards for dogs to enjoy being outside.  Dogs are constantly walked, bathed, and are given so much love and attention. I look forward to volunteering my time there each week.

Three months ago I met Frosted Face Miller as a volunteer taking him to a vet appointment. I fell in love with him immediately. With two cocker spaniels at home we never thought we would adopt a bully breed! There was just a feeling that he needed us. As with all people looking to adopt, we went through a home inspection and brought our current dogs to Frosted Faces to see if all three dogs would get along. It was clear Miller was to be a part of our family!  Miller has thrived in our home. It has become apparent to us that we didn’t just choose Miller, he chose US to be his family!

If you are looking for a senior dog or cat, I highly recommend Frosted Faces! To be a volunteer there is a privilege and we will continue to adopt from them!  Thank you Kelly, Andy, Jenna, Alicia and all the volunteers who work together to make Frosted Faces such a wonderful organization!< /text>

Unbelievable senior dog rescue!!!! They rescue older dogs from shelters and do everything possible to make that dog thrive! The shelter itself is a real home and the dogs just walk around, having out. There are tiny dogs to large dogs in every breed. They don't charge to adopt and offer 3 different ways to adopt.

It looks like your application came in on 4/10/20 when they whole world was trying to figure out how to navigate business during "social distancing" orders.  We struggled, like most businesses, of how to remain accountable for the safe placement of our dogs while keeping the people safe. Following "social distancing" orders, a week later came "shelter in place" orders and our policies changed to be the following:\nHi [Applicant\'s Name],\nThank you for your application to foster/adopt a senior animal from Frosted Faces Foundation.\n\nUnder normal circumstances, I would assign a volunteer to schedule a home inspection with you to ensure a Frosted Face will be loved and safe in your home. But given the current environment, we are working through a different process. Instead, we ask you to send us photos of your home, the front of your house with your house number, every room and the yard, especially the fence line, as well as you and your pet(s) (if applicable).\n\nThese photos will help us determine whether a Frosted Face will be safe at your home.  If we have any concerns, we will let you know.\n\nOnce we\'ve had a chance to review your home photos, we will reach back out to you to schedule an appointment."'}< /Response>< Review>
After going thru all the preliminaries I was not allowed to continue until I agreed to allow a person from ff to come into my home during the height of the 19 outbreak.   Having no way to assure that this stranger was safe I refused thus ending our quest to adopt<//Review>

What they do is rescue senior dogs (whose families have abandoned them because they're "too old") from kill-shelters and then find forever homes for them. And get this - the forever home does not have to pay for any vets bills for the rest of the dog's life! Frosted Faces pays for all the senior dog's medical care - all you have to do is give the dog a beautiful end to life.< /Review>< Pics>

{'time': 1578430227200, 'text': 'Hi Randy,\nThank you for visiting Frosted Faces Foundation with interest in adopting a senior dog! We do introduce guests who attend our Open Houses to all of the dogs on-site and volunteers answer questions to the best of their knowledge.\n\nIt is included in our very first email of correspondence with applicants, "*Please note that we are constantly screening applicants and cannot promise any specific animal will still be available, but we will do our best to find a great match for you!"\n\nIt also says on the Application website page, "*Frosted Faces will go home with the first approved and scheduled applicant."\n\nWe say these things because we are constantly screening applications and people do choose dogs for whom they did not apply during their scheduled introduction.\n\nThe screening process is clearly outlined in the first email from Adoption Coordinator once you apply, "I will be assigning a volunteer to schedule a home inspection with you to ensure a Frosted Face will be loved and safe in your home. A home inspection lasts 15-30 minutes, and the volunteer is instructed to complete an online form and take photos of your living indoor and outdoor space for review.\n\nThe home inspector is required to contact you within 12 hours of assignment, to have your home inspection completed within 3 days if your schedule permits, and they are to have submitted their report within 12 hours of their visit."\n\nOur screening process is also outlined on the Application page of our website, "Expect your application to be fully evaluated, along with contacting references, and completion of a home inspection within 3-5 days."  This process is also outlined on our Frequently Asked Questions page:\nWhat is the process to become a Family to a Frosted Face?\n1. Fill out the Application as completely and thoughtfully as possible.\n2. An application screener will email you to ask follow up questions, review your expectations, and schedule a home check.\n3. A volunteer from FFF will home check you to verify that your home is dog-friendly and prepared to take in a Frosted Face.\n4. Upon passing, your application screener will coordinate an appointment for you to visit Frosted Faces Foundation and choose a dog."\n\nWe do ask approved adopters to bring their current dogs to the appointment so that we can help with proper dog introductions to decrease liability and make sure it\'s a safe match.\n\nAdoption Coordinators let applicants know when the dog they were interested was adopted within 24 hours, although we do hope that applicants follow through with the screening process and choose another dog in need.\n\nWhile a senior dog finding permanent placement should be celebrated, we are sorry that this caused you disappointment because it was not in your home.  There are many dogs in need and we hope that you choose to rescue another.'}</Resp>

Update:
I received an email on 7-Jan 2020, after having written this review. It is almost an exact copy-and-paste of this response, but leaves out one thing, reproduced below: I was requested to remove my review. There was absolutely no interest in understanding why I wrote the review or why I felt I had a negative experience. The implication is simply that I did not understand FFF's protocols, and so was therefore disappointed with myself and should find a different way to handle it.

From Kelly Smíšek:
"I would like to ask you to consider removing your negative review about our organization.  Your reaction only negatively impacts the dogs in our care and there are more effective ways to handle your disappointment with misunderstanding our protocols."

I love dogs and only wanted to adopt a senior dog. I commend FFF and their staff for the work they do with helping these beautiful pups. I plan to continue to visit shelters and open our home and hearts to a dog in need. However, I will not work with somebody who cannot be bothered to take the time to understand why somebody felt a need to write a negative review about their own business, and simply assumes it is entirely because of our own misunderstanding.

Original Review:

We spent time with a Frosted Face for over an hour on a Saturday afternoon, and had a chance to speak with a Kennel Manager who had hosted her on a Frosted Fling for two weeks. She was able to provide a lot of useful information about the dog, including how she is in a car, what she eats, how she is with other dogs & people, etc. We were very positive about the experience. We discussed with the Kennel Manager that we didn't think we needed to bring in our existing dog to meet the Frosted Face, as it might not represent a natural setting for them. The Kennel Manager agreed. We applied to adopt her that night and were very much looking forward to having her in our family. The next day we just happen to notice on Instagram that she had been adopted. We were quite sad to see this. We received no notification at all. We also found out afterwards via email that there was more involved in the adoption process than what we had just discussed with the Kennel Manager the day before, including bringing our existing dog with us to FFF for a meeting with the Frosted Face we were interested in. While I am extremely thankful that a organization like Frosted Faces exists to take care of these beautiful senior dogs, I'm very disappointed with our first interaction with Frosted Faces Foundation.<//Review>

<text>Had many friends not impressed with their attititude there, for many reasons, so I will not waste my time with them.
And now FFF making assumptions as to who my husband is and wrecklessly making statements about a persons personnal situation. I have a friend who wanted to adopt and said she was never treated so rudely. I find these assumptions and lack of a persons private matters repulsive.
Update: Since “the person” who runs frosted faces felt the need to publicize Mr. Davis’s personal information the update is that it was understood that what happened to him was a scam and that no one was impressed with frosted faces part in this matter.  It was no surprise to Mr. Davis, as some of the regular volunteers told him they are not impressed with the attitude of “the person” in charge. Life is good and there are many other wonderful things about Ramona.<//text><user_id>108244196322541667980</user_id><username>Carol Davis</username><date>1562600304366<//date></record></dataset><record>

I sought help from them for rehoming a 12 year old dog (not my dog), and they were extremely unprofessional and told me he was better off dead. “I don’t even want to get involved.” “We don’t take dogs from bad owners.” “A little bit of pink juice is better than what he’s dealing with.” I don’t get aggravated easily, but they really struck a nerve with me. They couldn’t even give me an alternative number to call and hung up on me. I was literally shaking with anger by the time they hung up on me.

Needlesss to say, I personally will never recommend them to anyone. Ever.

*Edit since the owner has replied*
I was not “screaming” at them. Was I aggravated? Yes. Screaming and yelling? No. I was speaking in a tone that obviously let them know I was unhappy, but I do not scream. Additionally, the dog was not locked in a crate as they are claiming he was. He was in a large fenced dog run, and I explained that to them. I also explained that I had known the dog since he was born and that he was a very laid-back dog and did not require extensive exercise to “burn off” any energy. The only recommendation they gave me was a guess of a name of a rescue, with no additional information. No phone number, no website—nothing. Additionally, I will reiterate that I am not the owner of the dog and I was not the one that would have had any say of wether or not he would have been dropped off at a shelter, nor was he even in my back yard. I do not appreciate this organization misrepresenting what I had explained to them during their very poorly-handled phone call.</Review>
<Resp>{'time': 1550255120243, 'text': 'The woman who created this post called trying to give away a dog. She said it "nipped" at a visiting dog and now he is kept in a crate in the back yard and he cries all day.  He is a 12 year old Bull Terrier, a breed that requires a ton of stimulation anyways.  I explained to her that we don\'t take dogs from the public, and she said she refused to bring him to the shelter.  She also explained that this happened with the last dog too, which is where the comments, "I don\'t want to get involved" and "We don\'t take dogs from bad owners" comes from. Helping people like this only perpetuates the problem because they do not want the guilt of surrendering their dog to the shelter so they try to reassign responsibility.\n\nShe started to make it seem like it was the organization\'s fault that her dog was being treated poorly because we wouldn\'t take him, and started yelling at us. As the conversation escalated we told her that her dog was better off getting a little pink juice to help him fall asleep than locked up in a crate in her back yard crying all day.  She is sharing our comment out of context and not sharing the living conditions of the dog. We did refer her to the Bull Terrier rescue we work with.\n\nWe receive calls, emails, and Facebook messages all day long from people with these same sad stories and excuses. Frosted Faces Foundation cannot save all of the dogs in need nor can we solve everyone\'s problems. Good dogs die everyday in the shelter system and that is something we need to make peace with or suppress in order to do our jobs until we have developed a solution. We strongly believe that there are worse things than euthanasia, and one of those things is a poor quality of life.\n\nWe did have to end the conversation abruptly because she would not stop screaming at us. Needless to say, this phone call could have been handled better, but like most people with negative reviews about our organization, this is just one person trying to give away their dog who didn\'t like hearing that we were unable to help.'}</Resp>< pictures>

I sent a request to rehome my dog and received an unprofessional response from their team. We have exhausted every option and are trying to find the best place for our dog to go and instead of receiving compassion and understanding for our situation, we received criticism and judgement. I hope your experience is better than mine.<//Review>

Love this place, always top notch. Can’t ask for more.  I drive across town for work and have the choice of Noah’s bagels in Roseville or this place at the end of my commute. It’s no contest, this place cares about their customers and delivers a great product and service. I will always choose Bagel Cafe over Noah’s.  Just wish it was closer for my weekend bagels.</Text>

Delicious bagels and cream cheese! I stopped here this morning for a toasted bagel with cream cheese and it was very tasty. The bagel was soft and delicious and the cream cheese was great. They even have cinnamon crunch bagels, which happen to be my favorite! I can’t believe I’ve lived here my whole life and hadn’t been here until today. I will definitely go back!</text>

Not good. They microwave the breakfast sandwiches. Customer service is bad. They tried to keep my change. Panera breakfast bagels down the road are much better.< /Review>

<Text>I LOVE BAGEL CAFE!! The garlic bagel with avocado and bacon has, on numerous occasions, saved my whole day. They are such a sweet group of people and they handle so many random grumpy trashy weirdos as customers. At one point someone was loudly playing dominos every day and it’s like. Why? Why would a customer purposefully act like an annoying idiot? Most of the time they’re perfect and rarely do I see them have any troubles with accuracy and speed. If they’re a family, they function together well. They also let you buy bagels for a discount end of day!! You can call ahead too.</Text>< user_id>

This place has been here for awhile and is always a reliable treat when I'm shopping nearby. I like the bagels here - they're very soft and not too bready, so that you can really enjoy the cream cheese inside.  They also serve Java City coffee, which is a local company and great with the bagels. Looking forward to trying their other food someday</Text>< Gmap_id>

I didn't care for this place much, my mom had ate here before and liked it so maybe I had a bad expirence. The Bagel sandwich was very plain, they forgot my coffee, and you didn't give me what coffee I ordered.<//review>

<Text>Their burgers are tasty and their fries are okay, but not as as tasty as I like them. My husband and I think that now a days they are too expensive and we can eat a decent meal at a restaurant for the same price. It's only worth it if you are hungry after midnight when you don't have another option. They shouldn't charge that much! it's not worth it! Thanks.<//Text><Rating>4</Rating><username>PATTY PERSONS<//username></record></dataset><record>

<text>This place is a throwback to the old times. Good grub at a fair price.

Tasty burgers and fries.

My sister's family swears by this place. Every time they come up from Salinas, they don't stop at the burger joints along the freeway, they go to Sam's in San Lorenzo on their way to the Coliseum.

I gave Sam's 4 stars because it does have a lot of fried foods, but hey if that's what floats your boat, consider my review 5 stars.</text>< Pictures>

A classic San Lorenzo spot that has seen better days. My last visit was a shocker, prices have skyrocketed, really too expensive to go back. A childhood favorite of mine that I must sadly let go.<//Text>

Delicious, quick, and easy to get to. Love coming here for lunch and they're open very late for those nights you're hungry and need something filling. Definitely recommend.</Text>

Overpriced for a frozen patty burger, service from a young girl was horrible not friendly at all seemed like she hated her job and it reflected on her attitude towards customers. I just asked if she could split the bill since my friend had a card and all I had was a $20 bill and she acted like it was the worst thing ever closed the door and handed me back the card and the $20 and wanted me to hand her the 20 first then hand her the card later I didn't get that all. Fries were good though<//text>

came to this spot on a fluke.. they took my order had me wait about 10+ mins just to tell me that their debit machine was not working.. I would not be coming back nor would I recommend this place to anyone.. plus their burgers etc are pretty pricey.. if you are around the San Lorenzo or Hayward area I recommend trying rockit char grill.</review>

Been going there for years. Tonight I had the worst  burger, ever. Told them I wanted wanted everything but lettuce, got home and had a
1/4 in piece of meat and a little ketchup. Cost..6.25. Will never go there again and will never recommend them again..
Jack in the box, better and way cheaper!!< /Review>

I have eaten burgers from coast to coast and this little burger joint has blown away just about all of them. Juicy, think, and flavorful doesn't do it justice. I just which I had one of these back home. It reminded me of "Leon's" back in my college days.</Review>

Just as wasteful and disappointing. Kids inside wearing gloves and handling cash without changing. Sooooo much mayo and mustard on the dry burger. The fries were just a damn shame, smooshed all in the bag like they grabbed them with their hands and stuffed them in. Done with Sams!!< /text></record>

I love coming here for a yummy treat and a friendly face! The owners are so nice and the donuts are always delicious! Who needs cupcakes when you've got fresh donuts for birthday parties!? Recently, I got plain donuts and icing so my son could decorate his own donuts to make video game characters (from #AmongUs). It was a hit!< /text>

This place is one of the few places (in Torrance and further) that have chocolate donut holes, and pretty good ones. I can't say I've been to every donut shop but this one is nice and friendly with fresh donuts and other food items like sandwiches if you need a pick me up.<//text>< pics>

My family and I got our donuts home and halfway through them, I found what looked like a roach leg on a jelly donut. On further inspection, I found a live insect crawling around inside one of the twists.<//review>

Awesome maple bars and chocolate donut holes! A must eat when you visit!<//Review>

<response>None</response><Text>Great donuts at a great price and the breakfasts sandwiches are awesome. They don't have the greatest selection of donuts... Pretty much yeast or cake donuts with chocolate, Maple, or glaze in a few shapes but they are good. The yeast donuts are light and melt in your mouth. At $10 a dozen they're about as cheap as they come around here.<//Text>< Rate>

Best donuts in Lawndale!  My favorite is the raised puffs filled with Bavarian cream.  They are like donut holes but filled and covered in powdered sugar.  Yummy!  I also love their cake donuts because they are not TOO sweet.

If you want those raised glazed from that national chain then you might as will just mainline a sugar iv.  Yucky!

Daily Donuts does not accept credit or debit cards but don't worry if you don't have cash, they have an ATM right inside the door.  If your bank charges you to use the ATM then switch to USAA. But wait that is for another review.  😎<//review>

<Text>The donuts she gave me looked like they fell on the floor. They were all smashed and extremely doughy almost couldn't eat them lucky I was so hungry. And on top of it the lady was so rude. I only had a 20 and shes was visually mad that she had to get change for me. She got the change threw it in my hand and walked away. I still said thank you and she just turned and looked at me and she looked pissed off. Why? Because I was being polite? I'm never going back here and I'm gonna write this review everywhere so people can be warned about this horrible place.</Text><GmapID>0x80dd4ac1fc414d71:0xb93ccb7d14bc0a42<//GmapID><rating>1</rating>< user_name>

Best quality great service decent price. They may not be the cheapest but that's because you're getting high materials. They replaced a motor in my door which broke, and it was still under warranty and they covered it at no cost to me. As long as I live in Temecula, I will always go here!< /text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Review>On 2/19 my wife and I were driving in Menifee and a car ahead of us drove over a rock and destroyed the passenger side of your windshield.  After composing ourselves we called Temecula Toyota and they told us they partner with Faith Auto Glass.  We called around 3:45 and were told that they have a windshield that fits in stock.

We arrived around 4:15.  The staff was incredibly friendly.  They went through everything with us and offered to bill our insurance.  Despite closing soon they took our car in and the windshield was replaced within 45 minutes.  The technician also had vacuumed much of the broken glass inside the car.  He also informed us that the windshield had a lifetime guarantee.  I'm not sure what that entails but it's nice to know.

Overall I am thrilled by how quickly something so major was fixed.  I'm sure we could have shopped around and maybe found something a bit cheaper but if you want something done quickly and correctly then look no further than Faith Auto Glass.  It's where we will be going.</Review>< pics>

<Review>Awesome experience.  Faith was recommended by my mechanic and they did not disappoint.  They had an OEE windshield in stock and was able to schedule exactly when I needed. I dropped off the car, walked down the street for breakfast and it was ready when I returned about an hour later. Very friendly and accommodating.  Highly recommend and will definitely use again! Thank you Faith for taking care of me and my car.</Review><user_id>116643974527707140335</user_id><resp>None< /resp><Name>Nikki Johnson< /Name>< Date>

Faith Auto Glass & Window technicians pay extreme attention to detail. They treat you as family and they take great care of your car. This will be my fourth car getting tinted and I have never had any, not any problems with the previous cars tinted windows. I am thoroughly pleased with their work. Would recommend this company to all.</Text>

These guys are top notch! I had my windows tinted here back in 2012 (over 5 years ago) the tint started to crack. Faith honored their lifetime warranty even though I didn't send in the registration card. I only had to pay for labor for a complete tint job. I highly recommend a company like Faith who honors their customers for years to come!</Review>

<text>Outstanding service and quality work! Mike and his team took wonderful care of me and my car. My car needed a new windshield but Mike noticed that my driver's side window wasn't working and had his technician fix it for $50 labor only instead of charging me for a new regulator that I didn't need. He also noticed that my ignition key was bent and had that fixed as well, for free. I highly recommend Faith Auto Glass! Mike, the office  girls, and his great technicians will take good care of you and your car!<//text>< pictures>

I met the owner in 2019 seems like a real stand-up character. I get calls for my business, I get a lot of calls for auto glass! I recommend "Faith Auto Glass" in Temecula.</Review>

<text>Pros: Appointment was made easily. Staff seemed knowledgeable. My windshield looks great.

Cons: I have a zero deducible, when I dropped my car off the woman said she'd call if there was anything extra. When I picked up my car she said she tried to call, which she didn't, and then showed me a video that was so fast and shaky that I couldn't even see what she was talking about. And then up charged me $60.< /text>< pictures>

They did a terrific job on my Kia Optima.  Excellent Service!  Waiting for it to dry completely and put it to the test.  Faith Auto Glass tells me they use only a high grade tinting that can be covered by a nationwide warranty.  Very reasonably priced! Thank you Fernando and Steve!< /Text>

<Review>I had a great experience with Faith Auto Glass.  My driver's side window needed to be replaced.  I called around and spoke to Amber at Faith Auto Glass.  She was super friendly, was able to give me a quote for the window, and I was able to get the window replaced the next day.  The work was done quickly and professionally and the price was excellent.  I highly recommend them for all of your window repairs.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None< /response><gmapID>0x80db7f95d7722d55:0x19920e9eadca8373</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Fantastic service! Fixed our back window on our convertible and replaced the windshield wipers quickly and was nice enough to take on re-gluing the leather on the interior doors for us at no cost! Did a great job on all three projects! Five stars!!!< /Text>

I had my windshield replaced at Faith and I'm very happy! It didn't take long and the price was totally in my budget. The staff is professional and friendly. I'll definitely recommend them to all of my family and friends.< /Review>

Visiting from Tennessee and a rock hit our front windshield.  Not knowing where to go we ran across Faith auto glass. NEVER have we met a more professional, helping business. Insurance was accepted from out of state, work was clean and quick. Staff was amazing. I highly recommend this bisiness.

Great service and great prices. They go above and beyond to make sure you get what you want. I had my old tint removed and all 4 side windows plus the rear window all tinted in just a few hours. The car looks amazing with the new limo tint thanks to the team at Faith!</Review>

<text>We have brought our car here twice to get the front window regulator and motor replaced (both sides went out 3 months apart). Both times they were very nice and performed the necessary work quickly. I had even been mistaken when I brought it in the second time about which window had been worked on last and even though they had records showing otherwise they double checked and were so nice about my mistake. I would recommend!<//text>< Response>

My rear view mirror fell off.  After trying unsuccessfully to fix it with over the counter kits, I call Faith Auto.  I was frustrated.  Not only did they help me laugh about it, they made me an appointment right away.  Everything about my appointment from start to finish was stress free, quick, and wonderful!  I highly recommend this company for your glass needs.  Everyone seems to be happy and at peace there.< /Review>

I would say they did a really good Job with my window repair on my Ram. I drove a little out of my way but for some reason I wanted them to handle it. It came out really Good. A guy named Jeff recommended the place, Thanks Jeff. The Lady that dials in the place up front shes got a beautiful soul & cares about ya. The guys there are easily trusted like a experienced friends. It's a good home too get your Tint or Glass repair. You will be happy.</Review>

Pure excellence, they took care of my windshield and re-calibrated the sensors.
After bad experiences with other places I asked the dealership where they have glass done, they simply said "Faith" as if there is no other choice.
High quality and great people.< /Review>

My husband Bob made an appointment with Faith Auto Glass Thursday evening for an 8:00. am Friday appointment and he was blown away how fast they installed the front window, wiper blades and rubber molding plus tax less than their competitors price just for window replacement. These guys are awesome, very polite, and all work at a professional standard in a timely manner. Thanks Faith Auto Glass.<//review>

These guys were amazing! I had to replace my windshield on my 2011 Camry about 3 weeks ago. I waited to write the review to see if it was going to leak and it has not leaked at all. They did a great job and it was very quick service. Incredible! Factory glass, professional, and great service. Highly recommend if you are in need of windshield replacement in a quick, easy, and professional manner. Your crazy to go anywhere else!< /review>

I have been here probably 5 times and each time I am thrilled with the service and cost. The employees make you feel cared for and like they have your best interest in mind. My brother has been coming here for years to tint his windows and he is always beyond satisfied.<//text>

EXCELLENT workmanship and EXCELLENT customer service!  I have had several vehicles window tinted at Faith Auto Glass & Window Tinting and would not hesitate to return again and again.
You can rest assured that prices quoted over the phone will be what you pay, no hidden fees.
They are VERY competent, professional, friendly and go out of their way to ensure you are satisfied with their services. I would HIGHLY recommend!!  Thank you Faith & Fernando!<//Text>

Excellent work. Very satisfied and have returned numerous times.  Have had five cars tinted here over the years and have sent friends here. All very impressed and happy with the work.  Last week had windshield and rear window replaced and all windows tinted on my Camry. Bubbling rear window re-tinted on a Mercedes.  Very happy and very friendly people that make you feel welcome.< /Text>

Faith, Thanks again and you have a customer when in SoCal.

Did business with them in the past. I was given a price for a windshield and called to get it done. The Woman that gave me the price wasn't in. I talked to a guy. He said thebprice was MUCH higher. He asked me if someone had given me a WRITTEN estimate with that price. I said no and asked when the Woman would be in. He HUNG UP..... .Last time I was in was to get warrantywork done on an install from 5 months ago.....SOMETHING changed there. Be WARY of Faith Auto Glass!!!< /text>

Had to drive home a 1600 mile trip listening to an air leak whistling and howling loudly the whole way home. The nuts that held the window wiper panel were never replaced so it was flopping and the wiper hoses were not re-attached and the nuts on the wiper arms were not replaced. We had to leave when we did so could not wait another day for them to reopen and make it better. Very dissapointed.</Text>

This place is great and family owned.
I've been coming to them for tinting, windshield repairs and/ or replacement and They replaced the weather seals on my doors of my truck.

They are very friendly, very professional, very reasonable with their pricing, fast and the place is clean.

I have no issues referring anyone I know to them.
Keep up the great work.

The customer service here is amazing. I was referred to them through Express Tire for a window that slipped off track. The quality of work is great, but more than that, they were so nice. It was honestly the best customer service I have ever received for any kind of auto work. The price was great and exactly as originally quoted, and they pointed out all the warranty information for the parts in case the problem happens again.< /Review>

This place deserves more than 5 stars. I have been a customer for at least 10 years. The work is always done to very high standards of workmanship. Recently had my 2014 Jeep Wrangler worked on and it looks absolutely fantastic!  Never an issue there. I have recommended Faith Auto Glass to all of my family and friends and they are all happy with their quality work and great prices. Thank you. :)</review>

Very happy with the service at Faith Auto Glass & Tint

I have had multiple cars and trucks tinted here and 1 or 2 windshield replaced over the years

Always great service and quality work

Recently my rearview mirror came off and I took it in and they fixed it up for me right away

If you're looking to have your windows tinted or need a window replaced these are the guys to get it done

Highly recommended</text>

I found out about them through a popular YouTuber who had his BMW i8 rear windshield repaired. Unfortunately my front and back windshield's where smashed. As i ran out of luck being quoted very high prices I finally found Faith Auto Glass, they were extremely nice to me and made me feel welcomed, they offered me an amazing price and repaired both windshields in 1 day!! 5 out 5 service totally recommend them if you need you windshields or windows replaced!< /Review>

I have personally used Faith Auto Glass several times and they are just the Best. I have had them replace several Windshields because of Rock chips on Highway 15 and Highway 91. We have 4 vehicles and every time that we replace one the first thing that we do is take them to Faith Auto glass and have the windows tinted. We have been doing business with Faith Auto Glass and window Tinting for years. They are like Family!!</Text>

They have friendly staff and quick service.  My windshield needed replacement due to a big crack which is very stressful by itself, but they made getting it replaced as painless as possible.  They gave me a great deal on quality work.<//text>

Faith was amazing to work with. Very professional, kind, and courteous.  They even have fast wifi to use while they were working on my wife's VW.  They quoted me a much better price than all the other shops that we looked at and they did an excellent job.  I would highly recommend them.<//text>

Top notch! Treated well, did what they said they would, in the time they said they would, at a competative price.

<Review>My husband's front windshield was servlet cracked from a rock that was kicked up on the freeway. We stopped in and they gave an amazing deal and even fixed it on the spot. I was dreading the long wait that most repair shops have but this was so quick! 20 minutes in and out and my husband's window looks fantastic. They even offered to fix his broken window motor as well. Totally reccomened them!<//Review>< gmapID>

EXCELLENT customer service and tint job - extremely satisfied with the quality and personal attention that they do in their work. I called last minute on a Saturday and they were able to fit me in their schedule in less than a couple of hours and 90-minutes later, I was out the door.  Very reasonable rates and the quality is nothing short than excellence.</Text>

HIGHLY RECOMMEND THEM- I brought my Chevy Trailblazer in for a windowshield replacement. I also had my BMW 540 winshield replaced.  Faith auto glass does a beautiful job and they are quick.  My father has brought several BMWs here since 1998 and only recommends Faith Auto.
Excellent Customer Service!<//text>

Doesn't always have what I need but people here have always gave me great customer service. Do wish they would expand as I use to travel to other ones in other states for great finds you can't find in other stores.</Text>

Definitely not a One-Stop Shopping. But they do have a little bit of everything for the most part. If you hit it just right you can get some great deals.</text>

Store was dirty and poorly lit. A bell is on the checkout to alert the need for a cashier for check out. Store is obviously under staffed and there are no signs (except posted signs on the door) that any COVID precautions are being utilized.< /text>

<Text>As the only store of it's kind for several miles each direction, it serves more than the usual cheap stop source for your everyday needs.
I came here looking for basic household items: rope, tape, milk, earache relief, denture adhesive, milk, cereal, eggs, and laundry soap. They had it all, and I even browsed some seasonal items as well.
As far as your everyday house items they seem to be fairly well stocked, with an assortment of frozen goods like ice cream and inexpensive tv dinners. They even had fresh sourdough bread too. For a local stop it sure served the purpose.</Text>< Resp>

Having a Dollar General in our area has been a Godsend. Your corporation placed it nearly in the middle of the two nearest towns, 13 miles both ways. I would like to suggest a few additional products that would benefit Our local store and would likely be of benefit to most of your other stores as well.  The items I would like to see your company add to the inventory, would be 1. bagged salad greens, 2. Bagged potatoes,  3. Bagged onions, and 4. 1 lb propane cylinders.
Thanks for being such a great corporation.<//text>

<text>Not really a true dollar store, somethings can be cheaper here however you have to be diligent with respect to comparison pricing because some of their pricing can be quite high. I have found prices are much better at Walmart. Dollar General has a great deal of products made in China that basically is cheap garbage. So beware as high amount of items produced in China tend to have a high level of toxicity with respect to chemicals use to produce said items. Buy America when possible you and our country will be much better off.<//text></record></dataset><record>

That was only the second time I've ever been in one of those stores and the only downfall I would say is plan on spending a long time in the store. There is so much to see and such great prices I wound up spending about 3 hours but left with eight articles of clothing a bag of groceries and the sauce drink all for about $25<//text>

Went to rent a Rug Doctor & the associate didn't know how to fill out paperwork. Had to call a manager, which wasn't available til following morning.
Decided at that point to give my business to the Brookings, Oregon store.<//review>

Hello Melissa,

I would be remiss if I didn’t take the time to write an impact statement on how you provided me with exceptional service.  Believe it or not I had been trying to get my two(2) property refinance since September, 2020, and its April, 2021.  You were a breath of fresh you laid it on the line and went above and beyond on to get the loan closed.  I had talked to more than two dozen loan officers over course of the last 6 or 7 months and none were able to get the loans closed in a timely manner.   Yes, I was a unique case but that never deter you from  moving forward.  I always felt you had my best interest in mind and not just wanted to close a deal.  You keep it 100 all the way, you kept me abreast and up-to-date during the whole transaction and more importantly you returned all phone calls in a timely. I’m completely satisfied with the service I received on your behalf. You were always pleasant, professional and the customer service was outstanding. Thanks so much for being there and walking with me through the process. I will always be grateful for your concern and caring spirit. People Help, Helping People.< /Text>

Melissa was absolutely the best and gave me such a gift in having the peace of mind knowing I am finally in a fixed, really great, rate.

I so appreciated her support and guidance as she helped me to explore options, in a no pressure manner, making me feel extremely at ease until I was ready to refinance.

This was absolutely the easiest, fastest, and best process ever!<//Text>

<Text>Rate Plus is a great loan company, they helped my refinance a lot.
Gabe Cotton is an excellent loan officer, he is very professional and helped my refinance a lot. I did two times refinances for my house through Gabe Cotton. He is very patient, he works very efficiently. He closed my refinance loan very quickly as soon as only 3 weeks. And he helped to get a very low refinance rate as well, lower than other companies.
Gabe and his team are very professional, very efficiency. They closed my loan so quickly and with low cost. Thank you very much, highly recommend Gabe Cotton, excellent Loan officer, Rate Plus, excellent company to everyone!</Text>< pictures>

<text>Rate Plus is an excellent company -  I contacted David D. to do my refi loan on 4/6 and it funded on 4/29!!!   Excellent customer service, professional, very organized and very personable.

Had a great experience with refinancing my home through Rate Plus.  My loan officer, Melissa Floyd  was outstanding.  If you're looking for competitive rates and great service, I would recommend contacting Rate Plus and ask for Melissa Floyd.</review>

<text>Great experience with Rate Plus, Inc. and our Loan Officer, S. Carpenter. Very knowledgeable and did exactly what she said she would do. I've refinanced many properties throughout the years and this, by far, was the best experience I've ever had.

Just closed on our refinance with Rate Plus Mortgage. Our loan officer, George Ballard, was very professional and responsive. He was on top of it throughout the process of the loan. Our processor Tara was also great. She answered all of my questions promptly, and helped the loan close smoothly. They were both very honest, professional, and kind. It was a pleasure working with both of them. Highly recommend.<//Review>

Loan officer, Rinia Shamoon and loan processor, Betty Long have both been wonderful throughout the whole entire process with refinancing my loan.  Not only were they very professional and friendly, but more importantly, they were very prompt with getting right back to me with every little question I had, no matter how late it was in the evening.  Rinia even texted me back and replied to my emails around midnight.  They both provided me a very personal experience and made me felt like a VIP client.  Betty was great with all the little details in finalizing my loan and was always very thorough and patient with me.  I’m so glad I went with Rate Plus after going through two other lenders near the finish line.</Text>

I was shopping refi rates a couple months ago and my dad heard an ad for Rate Plus and recommended I add them to my research list. I hadn't heard of Rate Plus before, so I was slightly hesitant...my first contact was with loan agent, Dave Nottingham. He was extremely professional and instantly put any of my apprehensiveness at ease. I was FULL of questions...Dave was there for each of them with thorough explanations and never made me feel like I was asking a dumb question. Dave was able to find a great rate for us and eased us through the process. Tara Hurley was our loan processor and picked up right where Dave left off! Extremely professional and helpful every step of the way! I could not recommend Rate Plus enough. Add them to your list if you are shopping rates, you will be very glad you did!</Text>

From start to finish I couldn’t be more impressed with Rate Plus. George and Tara were more than amazing, did everything perfectly, professionally, and even closed within thirty days of starting the application. It’s nice knowing I will never have to refi again since I have the best rate ever!! Thanks again Rate Plus you guys were the best part of 2020</text>

<Rating>5</Rating><Text>My name is Elaine French I wanted to take just a moment and speak to you about my experience in refinancing my mortgage with Rate Plus and Dave Nottingham as my loan Officer.

Throughout the process, I was inundated with several company's biding for my business. After initially speaking with Dave Nottingham I very quickly felt that there was something different about Dave that set him apart from the rest of his competitors. He immediately made me feel a sense of trust. Being a single woman I feel that this is a difficult attribute to find when conducting business. Not only did Dave make me feel like I could trust him, more importantly he proved this to me throughout this transaction. Dave paid very close attention to every detail. Whenever I had questions or didn't understand something, Dave was always very happy to answer any of my questions throughout the process. Throughout the refinance I could very easily get ahold of Dave and if I couldn't he always promptly returned my calls I genuinely felt that Dave cared. Something very hard to find these days is the level of customer service Dave provided. My only hope is that this is something that your company recognizes and promotes.

Dave's customer services skills are ones that should be taught to others. It will be my pleasure to recommend Rate Plus and Dave Nottingham to anyone I can.

Fantastic job Rate Plus, the pleasure was mine !

Very Sincerely,
Elaine French<//Text>< pics>

The process was quick and painless. Almost no  issues came up and we went from application to funding in less than 22 days.  A few papers had to be re initialled at the end but otherwise there was no endless back and forth with this info or that.  Only wish would have been to have a few of the forms at signing pre filled in or at least a little clearer as to what was needed so we did not need a catch after signing.  Cody and Ronalyn get a big thumbs up.<//review>

I searched diligently for a well rated firm to refinance our home mortgage. Rate Plus was in the top tier so i contacted them based on the good ratings and also their low advertised rates.
We are old and the requested loan was relatively small compared to property value and we have FICA scores above 800 and adequate income so had assumed a refinance should proceed smoothly? Assumption proved accurate and Rate Plus representatives A J Salah and Jaclyn Villagrano  were pleasant, professional and competent. No unnecessary requests materialized and the loan was completed within 30 days with no drama.
YMMV but this was a good experience for us.</review>

Everything went so smoothly and with a perfect time frame.
Thank you for always being there for us.

I am just so happy with my experience here that I have to leave a review-- something I normally reserve for either extremely negative or extremely positive experiences with a business. I recently refinanced my home and worked with Ashlee Kinney throughout the whole process. I very much appreciated how immediately responsive, available, and patient she was the entire time. She always remembered exact details about me individually and made sure to answer the million questions that I had without making me feel rushed or silly. I appreciate this kind of quality whenever I encounter it in business, so I can't recommend them enough!<//Text>

I am glad that I did refinance with Rate Plus becuase I was impressed with Melissa, a loan officer, and Tara, a senior loan processor very much. Both of them are professional and efficient. When I was surprised with an unexpected issue at tge end of my refi process with the original mortgage company Tara went above and beyond to knock it off. And it worked. So thank you so much Tara. Thank you Melissa. You both are awesome!< /text>

I was able to work with Michael Nivera on a loan for our family and from the first day we spoke until the loan was closed Michael had been extremely responsive and maintained a high level of communication.

He was available to guide us, answer our questions and serve as our liaison through the entire process.

We could not asked for more and even after the loan closed we continue to communicate and discuss potential opportunities to take advantage of this ever changing loan environment.

Truly appreciate all you have done for our family Michael!<//Text>

Decided to give them a call and spoke to Ron who politely walked me through the process and asked me some honest, direct questions. Despite not being ready to move forward yet, I felt no pressure from him and the whole experience was amazing.

When I’m ready to pull the trigger, I’m definitely coming back. It’s hard to trust anyone with your personal information, but I felt like I could do that here. I’ll be back.</review>< pictures>

My loan was funded in less than 14 days! From the time I sent the 1st email inquiry until they funded my loan, it was 14 calendar days (8 days when it got to escrow). It's October 2020, they gave me an interest rate of sub 2.5% and no closing cost. AJ and Michael N are awesome.<//Review>

<review>I had a great experience with Dan Duenes at Rate Plus.   Dan kept me in the loop at each stage to assure my refi was quick and easy.   I got a great rate and saved a ton of money.  If you need a refi, make sure you consult with Dan during your research.  I almost got burned big time by another company that didn't disclose excessive fees.</review><Rating>5</Rating></record>

Usually never leave reviews; however, the ENTIRE refinance experience here has been so incredibly easy and satisfying that I was in a good enough mood to do so after my loan had funded. Always saw their advertisements for months on end and decided to give them a shot after shopping around for a few weeks.

Since then, I have literally been telling all my friends, family, and coworkers nonstop about, Jason Jung. This is the person that took care of my loan from start to finish, and made me feel so reassured the entire time that I will only work with Mr. Jung in the future for my mortgage needs. What really impressed me the most was that he made the refinance process so easy while being very focused on my goals for retirement and concerned about my cash flow each month by leveraging this property. On top of all that, he set the right expectations and got the loan funded right on time with no hassle for extra paperwork like the other terrible companies that I’ve dealt with in the past. I absolutely loved my experience here at Rateplus!

Next time you’re looking for a refinance ask for Mr. Jung at Rateplus!< /Text>

<Review>After submitting my application I finally get a call week later from "Dave."  Call was very rushed and felt pressured to make an immediate decision.  He promised to get back to me with more options, but never did.  Then another week later I get a call from "AJ" which I missed.  I asked him to call me back and he never did.  HORRIBLE SERVICE AND A COMPLETE WASTE OF MY TIME.</Review>< rating>

<Text>I plugged my phone into the outlet after making a purchase and was told not to use the power for long -- like 5 minutes.  Meanwhile there are plenty of seats and there is another customer watching movies on his plugged in phone.  Also,  they have been closing at 10.</Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMWNmHJratsh0ijMGbA8cbfxMD6hJanZPCW7rbj=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

<Review>(Translated by Google) One of the best places for snacks, I love the flavors, the size is good, the flavors of the waters are very delicious, the place is clean, those who serve are very friendly. The place is very spacious, it is also visible and they have parking available which makes the visit much easier, I really recommend them👍👍.

Uno de las mejores lugares para antojitos, me encantan los sabores, el tamaño es bueno, los sabores de las aguas muy deliciosas, el lugar está limpio, los que atienden son muy amables. El lugar es muy amplio, también está visible y tienen estacionamiento disponible lo cual facilita mucho más la visita, realmente se los recomiendo👍👍.< /Review>< pics>

(Translated by Google) Good donuts, coffee tastes like soap, I don't know if it is water, or they will leave soap to the coffee maker.

Buenas donas el café sabe como a jabón no se si sea el agua o será que le dejan jabón ala cafetera.< /Review>

<text>Great place for small kids to come play. Each room has a different theme so the kids can play make believe in a fire station, class room, all the way to a kid sized gym. It didn't get too over crowded the one time I was there. Prices were reasonable for two kid's admission and the facility was decently clean especially due to the fact that kids play pretty rough here each day. Only suggestion would be the hours. Would be nice if they opened a little earlier then noon and stayed open on weekends. All and all, great place though for mom and kids to come play just to get out of the house.</text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None< /response><gmap_id>0x80db7de51c1838ab:0xc3aec1137bfd228</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<pictures>None<//pictures><Text>I’ve been here TWICE and both times they were closed??? The first time a sign on the door, but they should post on the website, or at least their social media so parents don’t drive all the way there for them to be closed. I went again TODAY, and closed again. It’s supposed to be open play? Their own worker wasn’t even sure, and couldn’t contact the owner. Unprofessional. Was thinking of hosting my daughters birthday there, but don’t think I’ll be coming back at all🤷🏽‍♀️ There was also another family waiting as well to see if it would be open, because it was during open play hours.

EDIT: your site says suspended in DECEMBER. It is a Tuesday in January and I don’t see anything About MWF. Your website still say M-F 12-5 open play.</Text><gmap_id>0x80db7de51c1838ab:0xc3aec1137bfd228</gmap_id><Name>Lizzy Banuelos< /Name><userid>106153052485511721141</userid>< time>

<Text>We love this place!! So many cool different themed room for the kids to play in. I have a 4 yr old and a 1 yr old and they both love it. Clean bathroom and a changing table. Also, there are tables and chairs in the back if your kids need a snack break. The Staff is great!! Don’t forget your socks!< /Text>< pictures>

<text>3.5 🌟 We walked in and were greeted with a smile. The location was bright, clean and spacey. The kids had a blast playing make-believe. There were a few toys that were not functional or had no batteries. There is a play room that has a military boot camp theme. My issue, as a veteran is that they are only flying  4 of 5 military flags. Imagine Me Grow is a must do location for the kids.<//text>< pictures>

<text>This place is amazing. Perfect for the 3-year olds we hosted for a party there. They played non-stop. And I was happy because it is very clean and safe. And the party options are great...you can pick and choose options to fit your budget and level of personal contribution. My son also loved the open play times. Overall I would recommend this place to ANYONE. Happy to have a place like this in the area.<//text>< gmapID>

<review>My 2 kids had a blast at this place!  My boy is 4.5 and my daughter is 3 and they both don't stop moving while they're here.  It is constant stimulation play interchanged with real life experiences.  It's a perfect indoor play place for children ages 2 and up!  Great for parties and gatherings!!  We held a painting party here over the summer and had plenty of room while others played in the facility without being bothered by our party.  Wonderful and accommodating staff who are always attentive and prepared.  Great job guys!  This is a "must have" for kids in the Murrieta/Temecula area!</review>< Pics>

Hands down the best place to throw a kid party!

Our 5-year-old loves open play at this place. So naturally we knew Imagine Me Grow would be the perfect place to throw our youngest daughter's 1st birthday party. And boy were we right! It was completely stress-free and there was no mess to clean up afterwards.

We were allowed to bring in our own food/decorations; however, you can also purchase them through Imagine Me Grow. But regardless, the staff, which by the way, were the sweetest, helped set up our party decor and food/dessert stations. Oh, and they even took photos as well!

Also, most kid party centers do not allow you to bring in your own food so this was a major plus for us as our oldest has a couple severe food allergies.

But the best part of it all was that all of our guests had an amazing time. Everyone kept complimenting how fun and cute the place was. Some even mentioned they'd like to throw their next kids birthday party there.<//Text>

Fantastic place for kids birthday party!! My review is long overdue, as my son's party was almost two years ago, right after they opened. The owners were very accommodating and could not have been nicer. Last year for our son's party we tried something new but, I would love to go back this year to Imagine Me Grow.</Review>

It was fun for ages 1-9 but any younger there isn't really anything to do and they still charged you. We had a 10month old baby and they charged us. He didn't even play. So for 4 kids it was 30 and the place isn't very big. Better off just doing it as a birthday party not for Open play.</Review>

My children love coming to Imagine Me Grow because they can do just that...Imagine! They can be a fireman, a DJ, a chef, or whatever their hearts desire. It is a very bright and clean place, which is important for me as a parent. Definitely will be taking my children here more often!< /Text>

I had a lovely time celebrating my youngest 1st birthday at Imagine Me Grow. All the kids at the party had a blast!!! My private event was PRIVATE and i loved it!!!! The only thing that wasn't it for me but the kids loved it was the kids pop lol the host and I joked about the music so many times. The host was also amazing, really sweet young woman. May be hosting another event soon.<//Review>

Nice place for the kids to play.
Was hardly anyone there when we went. They are only open a short time during the day. By the looks of the sign in sheet only 6 people had been there all day.
Honestly I don't know how they pay the rent, must be some kinda money laundering operation....< /Review>

<text>Wonderful fun play stations! We attended a birthday party here today for a classmate of my son. 4/5 year olds and their siblings were welcomed and allowed to play and explore. It reminded me of a  children's pottery barn catalog brought to life! Very sweet moments as my son and friends served one another in the bakery and sea food restaurant. My younger two loved the fire station very much. The cars can be pushed around the road and this was a please t surprise. The dance room was often empty but once in a while the children would enter and burst into dance. It was fun! Each room has a small screen tv with the rooms topic playing on the screen. At first I felt this was unecessary but as the party progressed it made sense, and had no sound so it wasn't intrusive to their imaginative play.

A music room would be fun, but trust me the kids were very satisfied and the play kitchens, fire station and dance room seemed to be my three boys favorite.

If I had to give any critique it would be to share that it is not a tactile/sensory experience as it is very clean and free of any sand or water play. That is understandable as it accomadates cooperative play amongst many children, young children. The environment fostered cooperative play and surprisingly allowed children the freedom to cooperate and play individually. I highly recommend!

In a time where children play centers resemble casinos and bars, and are often filled with video games this was refreshing!

Created for the younger child I find it sweet that they are not bombarded with flashing lights and bribery of candy and cheap toys. If my older kids were with me I could see them getting a little "bored" but I would encourage them to play and pretend with their younger siblings and I know the entire family would be better for it! So often we spend time and money to celebrate our children but we end up just consuming and teaching them greed and consuming. This truly fosters imaginative play that will help families bond, social skills flourish and develop life long memories.< /text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

<text>I came in today to make a exchange. The cashier today was so busy about my mask position she neglected to pay attention to my transactions and her customer services. She was upset I disagreed with her asking me to cover my nose and my mask was covering my air ways of my nose. So I told her it is and that the big plastic sheild in front of us was protecting her anyway. She gave me a bad attitude which made me question her abilities to make a sale and have good customer service.  Because she was acting as if she was the cop of all masks and manager of this store. She was so angry she didn't want to act  appropriate. I tried to get her to explain to me my transaction so I know I'm getting a proper exchange.  And I stated to her that her customer services was terrible and I don't know how she got hired.. I have been coming here for 8 yrs and today is my last. Not worth my money and time to be treated this way all over a mask ..

Products are affordable here but not durable.</text><date>1612258663627</date><response>None<//response>< Name>

Good store having all types of man, woman and kids clothes and accessories. You will always find good deals here. The isles are small and congested, little crowded all the times and things spread on the isles make it little difficult to navigate around the shop but that is not a big deal. This shop also has good variety of home decoration stuffs. Has lots of parking space and some good stores nearby that makes shopping easy and saves time.<//text>

I bought a bag and after two days at my work place I took it out of my car so I could get inside my work place the handle broke instantly. I went to return it and they said they couldn’t take the bag and won’t give my money back. The reason was i used it but I couldn’t answer them properly. I spoke with the lady who  was just rude as the cashier. Half of this is my fault but half of this is their fault too.  My request to the customer service is that: Please do be kind to your customers. And I would like to say to the customers is that: Please Be beware of what you choose from this store. No hate forming but I seriously don’t want to go to this place ever again.<//review>

It is a well stocked discount store. The staff is great and the customers seem to understand nice. Not a pretentious store and people here seem to appreciate it. If you need to show off your wealth this isn't the place. I like it.< /review>

Accessible location with ample parking for all. They also have a lot of fitting room that you can use.

For a fewer crowd and shorter line, try to visit during early mornings (right after it opens) or late evenings (before it closes).

People here are friendly and kind to all. The greeter or theft prevention personnel is always cheerful and welcomes you warmly the moment you enter. I personally appreciate Johnny, he always give us product feedback whenever asked.

They have plenty of choices for clothing, toys & kitchen utensils. I also enjoy their choices for arts and crafts and home decorations.

Definitely our to-go-to whenever we want to shop!<//Text>

I know that it is the rude, tacky customers that leave shoes all over the ground and everywhere, but it would be great if the area was straightened up. Usually only 1-2 checkers at any given time, but wait to check-out is usually not bad. I return fairly regularly.</text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

I really like this DDs. There is a lot of everything in this store. I am not a fan of their cashiers. Customer service sucks here... they don't greet with a smile or even small chat. They come off  rude a lot of times, and I go to this DDs a lot.</Text>

DDs discount is like the extra ghetto Ross, and I don’t mean that in a bad way. Ross is literally right across the street, so whenever you need the odd household item like shower curtains or rugs and you can’t find them at Ross, give DDs a try. Their inventory is similar and this store never gets that busy. Just be careful where you park your car. This lot is a certifiable hazard.<//review>

It's another choice of Ross. But not better than Ross. Clothes options are good but not as good as Ross. This place is good for kids toys. It's having lot of toys verity and options. Price range is very good, not very expensive. So everyone can buy from here.</Text>

< review>
Large selection of men, women and children's clothes as well as purses/backpacks at decent prices. The home and shoe sections are small, as is the electronics section.
The store itself is packed tight and the aisles are rather small. During my visit today, I noticed a lack of maintenance throughout the store. The carts were mucky and the floors were dirty - and the changing rooms were untidy, with doors that wouldn't close.

In short - if you need a quick one-stop-shop for clothes/bags, the selection here is great. But if you're looking to enjoy the experience of browsing, this store may not be what you're looking for.</review>

Took my friend here to buy vacation clothes and she was happy to buy 10 outfits for less than $100. Her only complaint was the shoes, they didn't carry her size but not many stores would carry her to small foot size!< /Text>

<Text>Place is prejudice and racist.  If managers dont care neither will the employees.  But managers also know consumers will always come because of the keyword in their store name.  "Discount". Everyone loves the word and knows to be curious enough to go through the doors and find out what the discount is.  You have to have great patience and understanding to shop here and an empty bladder.  Enjoy!</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><user_id>115641773223808552819<//user_id><Time>1453046082949<//Time>< Gmap_id>

It's a typical discount store. Lots of people. If you don't like crowds, don't go. Lots of bargains. Staff is friendly.</review>

This place sucks. We shopped for half an hour and bought many things but they will not allow us to use their restrooms. The staff rudely told us that the restrooms are not available even for customers and basically told that they do not care even if we stop coming to the shop but they will not allow us to use the restrooms
I heared the same experience from a lady I met in the store. Her kids wanted to use the restroom badly but the store wouldn't allow it. Poor lady had to leave the store immediately

The place is filthy and completely disorganized. The discounts were ok but its not worth the trouble in searching for items, specially with a full bladder which they will not allow you to empty.</text>

They gave permission to an adult before re-denying entry to my 8-year-old girl because she was alone. Opening bathrooms deny them. The children don't know how to wait. And the people in the store so rude. Not all are equal there are those who are very kind. But those who touched me today in the locker room area, lousy.

Fui a regresar algunos artículos  y mi hija necesitaba usar el baño.  Le dieron permiso a una persona adulta antes  de volver a negarle la entrada a mi niña de 8 años por qué iba sola.   Abiendo baños los niegan. Los niños no saben esperar.  Y las personas de la tienda tan groseras.   No todas  Son iguales hay  quien es muy amable.   Pero las que hoy me tocaron en el área de  vestidores, pésimos.< /Review><pics>None<//pics><resp>None</resp>< gmap_id>

(Translated by Google) I do not remember what the stupid manager is called but I had to report that he had me that whenever he went he would keep watch and I would watch over the whole store thinking that he was going to steal damned crazy old woman. I have years buying in dds i would never do that, that's why it gave me so much courage to be careful with that woman

(Original)
No recuerdo como se llama la estúpida mánager pero tube que reportar la me tenía arta que siempre que iba me segia i vijilaba por toda la tienda pensando que iba a robar maldita vieja loca.
