<Review>The food and ambiance despite a pandemic was great. Pianist and outdoor dinning made for a great energy. The broth  from the mussels was warm and bright. The pomegranate sauce that accompanied my duck confit was EVERYTHING. Sweet,  savory, spicy, umami!!! I cant forget to mention the creme brulee cheescake!! Rich and creamy, perfect mix of both desserts.  Def coming back. Food ervice was a bit slow, however I attribute that to staffing ..our server was great.. she was friendly and knowledgeable.</Review>< rating>

<Review>Food has great flavor and presentation.  The dining is very limited,  so you have a chef to table feel.  Selection is broad and not a burger and fries selection.< /Review>< Pictures>

<text>Had a great meal with friends. The atmosphere is good but definitely off the beaten path of where you would expect a fine dining experience. The menus is photo copies on plane paper in black and white. Odd. The food is great though. I had a seafood lasagna that had lobster, shrimp and crab. Oh that was good!!!  I would give it 5 stars if it had a little nicer atmosphere.<//text><UserId.>107452818071123170159< /UserId.>< Time>

Simply Amazing! The service was second to none, the food was five star quality and the drinks were on par with the rest of the dinning experience!

<Review>I don’t normally write reviews. But this restaurant was so spectacular that I felt compelled to write one. Every dish from the mussels to the stone fruit salad to the butternut squash ravioli to the lamb was incredible. We finished off the evening with a chocolate lava cake. The service was also amazing. If you are a foodie - you will love this restaurant!</Review><Gmap_id>0x808fff1d98924ef7:0x15df8d094e844911<//Gmap_id>< time>

Scottie is an excellent place to enjoy a meal! My wife and I celebrated our Anniversary there and what a treat it was!! It seemed like we had our own Chef and waiter! Scottie gave us great advice on the wine, where he gets his supplies and history on his supplies. The service and staff were excellent. We will definitely visit this restaurant again very soon!<//Text>

Everytime we have something special to celebrate, this is our spot. The restaurant is clean, the service is friendly and professional and the menu is outstanding.  I recommend the pork chop. My wife would kill for the salmon wellington... though that is a special so not always on the menu. Having a date night in east county? Try Scottie's</Review></record></dataset><record>

Scottie and his staff were on point this evening.  They immediately greeted us by name (the husband had made reservations) when we walked through the door.  A table had already been set up for us along with two glasses of complimentary champagne (we were celebrating a belated Valentine's Day).  The waitress, and I am so sorry I can't remember her name, was phenomenal.  She was very attentive and polite.  The food was delicious, especially the garlic bread and cordon bleu.  As we we're getting ready to leave after a meal, or waitress was so kind and handed us our leftovers as she opened the door for us. Such a wonderful little restaurant, and a great staff. On a side note, it was wonderful to see the owner inside the restaurant greeting customers, helping at the tables, and also cooking in the kitchen.  Bravo!< /Text>

<review>Service was great. Food was cool overall but the dishes we had could've used more salt to bring out the flavor. Because of this, I felt like it brought down the value of the meal, but I'd be willing to go back & try them again in the event it was an off night</review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

<text>The chefs at Shutters had a meatloaf daily special when I visited, along with spinach and mashed potatoes. The meatloaf was one of the best that I've had in the bay area, and the ambience of the restaurant is unexpectedly exceptional. Relaxed and refined with candlelight, amazing food, and pretty decent wait staff. This little spot in a strip mall is a diamond in the rough, and should absolutely not be missed!<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

Date night with the wife on a Friday night.   Nice atmosphere and great live music.   The setting is surprisingly inviting,   I didn't expect this in a Brentwood business area in this location.   Hidden gem of a restaurant.   Great local food from local farms in the area.   Attentive staff and great food for the price.<//Review>

Scotties is a place we go to celebrate something! Excellent quality food so well prepared, ambience not evident from the outside, and attentive service from friendly chef and wait staff! Luncheon shrimp salad was full of freshly grown greens, perfectly grilled shrimp, flavorful light dressing. We shared the decadent chocolate flourless cake and smooth creme brûlée. Both were outstanding! We LOVE this place, have taken several friends, and have recommended it to all our new neighbors!! The BEST of Brentwood!!<//Review>

Excellent food and excellent service. Fair pricing for a nice dinner and a very pleasant atmosphere. This place made for a very enjoyable date.

You cannot go wrong with the chicken cordon bleu.

Meal for two with appetizer, entrees, deserts and wine was $120 with tip.</Review>

Absolutely Satisfied.

The abridged review - great atmosphere, amazing food and excellent service. My husband and I can’t wait until our next visit! Thank you to Scottie and the wonderful staff you have employed. Truly made our anniversary very special, especially being our first as Brentwood residents!

I have to note, we had our excellent experience all while two new staff members were being trained in the kitchen and two servers had called in sick. Keep reading for the detailed review.. : )

My husband and I are relatively new to Brentwood and heard this was the best place in town for a romantic night out. We were celebrating our 4 year wedding anniversary and were not disappointed in our experience. They note ‘slow service’ on their site, unless you have a time constraint (in which case let them know). We thought the night was wonderful and really let us enjoy each plate as it came.

We had a table right opposite the kitchen and really enjoyed watching all the food be prepared. We were able to watch as such delicious plates were created and sent out. We started with the garlic bread and their caprese salad. Delish! The garlic bread comes with a great dipping sauce too! Then we shared a bowl of the soup de j’our, cream of asparagus. SOO GOOD. My husband had their steak dish - the veggies were cooked perfectly and the mushroom/red wine sauce/topping to the steak was amazing! I ordered the chicken riesling - soo good! Again, veggies were perfectly cooked and complimented the dish so nicely. I wanted to lick both our plates! We finished our meal with a piece of their cheesecake - HOLY COW - so delicious and light. We were in love. Can’t wait to visit again!!<//text>

<rating>5</rating><Review>This is by far the best food experience one can get in the wider East county! Scottie is one of the best chefs I have had the pleasure to prepare a meal for me! The service is excellent as well. Food ingredients are from mostly local farms and everything is fresh and prepared from scratch. No frozen, reheated, or otherwise disgusting foods there!! The atmosphere is modern, industrial, but casual and romantic (candles, etc.). Nice selection of wines too. Prices are absolutely fair! My favorite eating establishment in the Bay Area!< /Review>< pics>

<review>This place is a gem. Elegant, simple, and full of class, you wouldn't expect to run across something like this in the outskirts of Brentwood. French cuisine that could run with some of the better French-style restaurants I've come across. Went there for just the dessert menu - and I left impressed.<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Rate>5</Rate><username>Rob Nielsen< /username>< UserId.>

Loved the atmosphere and Rosie our wait staff. We love french food, this is nothing close to french food. Everything had a tarragon taste to it and the restaurant was too warm. It was our anniversary wanted to go someplace special so we chose Scottie's. Disappointed,  sugget some Edit Piaf and french music for atmosphere. OMG the bill was $172.06. Insult to injury.<//review>

This year's thanksgiving was very disappointing compared to last year. At $50. A plate, prime rib was well done and lumpy mashed potatoes were lumpy. I guess this will be our last thanksgiving there😣<//text>

Food was outstanding! Service was great. On the pricy side but you get what you pay for.  I didn't feel ripped off.

It's also in an industrial area but it's Brentwood so does it really matter?  Not that big of a deal. If you want fancy locations, sit in an hour and a half worth of traffic and head to SF.<//review>

< review>
I'm so sad tonight was such a disappointment. We went a year ago, and it was a 5 star experience. This time, the food was not nearly as good and dinner service was extremely slow. We sat there for 45 mins after we finished our appetizer as waiting for our main dishes to come out.

Last year, I had the escargot appetizer, and it was the most amazing version of escargot I've ever had. This year, it tasted like cleaning fluid and rancid nuts. I had to send it back, and I NEVER send back dishes. It was just inedible.

The duck breast was good and cooked perfectly, but the flavor combinations on the plate were poorly done. The black rice risotto had little flavor. The mushrooms were under cooked and didn't feel like a good part of the dish. And I'm a mega fan of mushroom risotto. But honestly, a frozen bag from Trader Joes tastes better.

Unfortunately, tonight was such a turn off, I don't think we will be going back ever again. I'm so sad, last year was amazing. I have a deep love for French quizine. I don't know if management changed or just the chef, but this was no where near as good as it was a year ago.< /review>

Jazz music background (and live on Fri or Sat), curated wines (and free tastings) from local vintners and wonderful French-inspired cuisine.  Our meal on July 4th was amazing.  With the one exception of broth for mussels being a bit saltier than we'd like, all the dishes were winners - Chicken Cordon Bleu, Beef/Pork meatloaf, Bone-in pork chop, Duck confit were the entrees.  Sides were delicately prepared and seasoned to match.  Sauces were French-style savory reductions.  Desserts!  Fabulous!  Chocolate Fondant, Creme brulee cheesecake (not sweet - firm, rich, creamy), Fruit tart (warm, crumby, almond background like marzipan).  Not a cheap date, but a top pick for Brentwood.< /text>

<date>1480375984886</date><rating>5< /rating><text>Found this on the Internet by searching for new restraunts near Brentwood, so we were not sure what what to expect. Our meals were absolutely perfect down to the last green bean and the service was attentive, friendly and helpful, extending to the wine selection, which also was a bery good Pinot Noir. The owner even came by to introduce himself and to see if we needed anything.
We are taking some friends for lunch soon and so hoping our experience was not a fluke.
Just excellent! Will try to remember menu specifics for our second review.</text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

Overpriced, overcooked, and under seasoned, and in no way is a lava cake a soufle.<//review>

<date>1579894797947</date><rate>5<//rate><Text>I called in for a price quote and was told they were not busy this Friday morning and to come on in. Thinking it would take at least 30 minutes I brought my dog along to take a walk while I waited. I was shocked when I barely finish the paper work and he brought back my cars keys and the completed smog certificate! The price he quoted was the price I paid and I don't think I was there more then 10 minutes - TOTAL! I was very impressed and will use them again.< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None<//resp><GmapID>0x80c3261c16a562f7:0x9fe541ce6bceb389</GmapID></record>

Best and fastest smog shop I've ever been to and they have if not the lowest prices around town, their costumer service puts them above all the rest. I send everybody I know to them for that reason and still no complaints.< /text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><text>I have been using Vlads tires for many years.  I use to service tires at other big tire places but  had to wait for several hrs.   But I really didn't like to come and sit for hrs reading magazine waiting for tires to be changed.  At Vlads Tire I am in and out within 15 minutes.  In the last few years Vlad hired several more helpers, so his tire shop services 3 cars at a time.    And I like his affordable prices.<//text>< pictures>

This guy is extremely personable and professional. He knows exactly what he's talking about and what he's doing. If I still lived in Sacramento I'd be a lifetime customer. I really wouldn't go anywhere else for new or used tires. Also, I was in and out of the within a half hour, exceptional service.<//text>

Vlad had my high quality tire with all but new tread, in excellent condition and was charging the same as a local Davis that had only 2/3rds life left.  He also took only 10 min to mount and balance as compared to a 45 min (or longer) timeframe from the local place (which i used before and was 'good').<//text>

<Text>I have 37s on my truck and most tire shops won't want to deal with that tire size or charge and arm and a leg. Vlad was friendly, helpful, quick as well as reasonable prices.

Heard good things about Vlad’s Tires, so tried it for the first time. I did like the service, its fast, and from what I heard - quality service (so far - so good). Dont mind being charged extra for service if they do a good job. Compared to other places that charge $10 per tire, here I was charged $15 per tire on prius and $20 per tire on Honda Odyssey. Most important, I definitely was overcharged for the tires. And when I say overcharged I mean $150 extra at least. I paid with the impression that I was getting Hankook tires (receipt said nothing about what kind of tires im receiving), but upon installation, I found out that that they were Nankang sp-9. Originally, I was quoted $320 for these tires INSTALLED, but wanted something better (and willing to pay more for better tires), so I was quoted a higher price. Turned out I paid $90 (before tax) per tire ($487 total installed) on Odyssey when you can get them for $60-$65... that’s a big difference from $320. And thats just one car... I asked the owner a few times if he is sure that’s the right price for these tires and if he charges everyone like this - and he said yes. Well, that was my first experience.

As a follow up to your reply: Les Schwab - you know what you are getting and what you pay for. At your place - you dont know what you pay for.

And no, i never bought used tires from you, inquired - yes. Fixed tires - yes.</text>

<Text>If this was a year ago I would give 5 stars but they picked up their prices like all the other tire shops... But they are providing service from an ordinary warehouse shop,, no waiting area no bathrooms, no coffee no anything.  I started taking my cars to a bigger cleaner and better shop and pay even less at times than they charge.</Text>< Name>

The people there are passionate about cars/motorsports. They offered one of the best pricing. I will definitely go back.</review>< Pictures>

But their inventory is low, I would recommend calling ahead to make sure they have what you are looking for. Also parking is a bit of a problem.< /review>< Pictures>

Just had my supposed "like new" tire pop that I paid extra for. Didn't even last half a season and the dealership originals are still holding on better then that trash did. Go next door or down  the street, they will try to over sell the same tires for like $20 more. For got</text>

<rate>4< /rate><text>There are 3 tire shops in this location off Ist. If one shop doesn't have the tires you need they'll check with the other locations and get you taken care of. New tires need to be ordered but they are pretty cheap compared to other retail locations.

Downside - they sell mostly used tires so be sure to inspect the tread wear and condition of the tires before they mount them.< /text><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

<resp>None</resp><review>My Vlads Tires story

I had needed a set of tires that are not available were ever I had went and long wait and cost an arm & leg to get. Vlad had managed to get me a set next day and blew the other tire shops way out of the ball park with the price. Not to mention he stayed  an hour 1/2 after work hours for me to come in after I had got off work due to my commute from my work location. Was very nice and super professional. I highly recommend Vlads Tires to anyone in need of tires. Also wanted to thank Vlad for all your help and honest and great quality work.I had a great experience with Vlad's Tires.

My name is Genadiy (Geno) and that's my Vlads Tires story.

<text>Played the course as a visiting guest from Lake Merced GC.  Jay, the Head Pro, and others were welcoming and friendly.  The course is beautiful and challenging with elevated greens similar to what we're used to at Merced.  Thanks again Jay for being a good host!</text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMpNIxkoCwLKVHRLFQTeeCqZPln6Zoqop4MnGA1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP-i0ZdGSQrTQy0-gFIKc154XD5vYg59s1zg05q=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPN2cq3Wgw--lGTc1tp_-Lrg_l55knyTfToYfkt=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNP9Mfbob3R82dchV4xyVezzEnlHMa5ZGC0fsLF=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< response>

<text>Rejoined as social members after a long absence. Really impressed. Friendly and not-stuffy, yet super facilities, service and food. This is a sweet-spot combination that will be hard for other Santa Barbara clubs to ever match.< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><Gmap_id>0x80e9153cb759c5e1:0x7111b7a4b1338ae6</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

What a lovely view from the hill. We had a nice dinner in their well-lit dining room. Something for everyone and the food was delicious. The furnishings were lovely and very comfortable. The staff attentive but not hovering.</review>

<Rating>4<//Rating><review>Very disappointed they have not replaced the lake that was so beautiful with someone pleasingly aesthetic. They certainly have the staff to maintain the area so that it emulates the standards they represent. The food and dining are quite nice and exemplifies the standards that would be expected of a club of this stature. The staff are all nice and we certainly have no complaints about service.</review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

I got the honey/coleslaw/pickle sandwich and it was Huge! The chicken is moist and tender and the flavors of the sandwich were really good together. This originally came with the waffles for bread but after asking they suggested getting the bun to soak up the honey which I think was a great idea. I have had the waffle sandwich before and I believe that the waffles could be better. They're not crispy... I've also had the garlic fries and fresh biscuits with gravy and they are ridiculously tasty! Will definitely visit again.</text>

The food is good but the staff is rude. I was asked if i wanted to leave a tip on carryout. Maybe that's standard now but i said no and the cashier turned and walked away without another word. No receipt, no napkins, no plastic forks, nothing. They will never have to ask me again because I'll eat somewhere else<//text>

I enjoyed Mimi's Southern chicken sandwich. Juicy chicken, cheddar cheese, bacon, bbq sauce and coleslaw in a waffle. Different, tasty, filling. I had some shoestring fries and now I'm content.< /Text>

Have always loved the mother clucker until tonight. Cold as ice (we only live a few miles away), and the egg was cooked so hard it was like rubber. It was fed to my dog. Very disappointed because this has never happened before.<//text>

The grilled chicken sandwich used to be delicious, but now is always overcooked since they started using chicken strips instead of chicken breast. I've tried it 5 times just to make sure and it was consistently tough and chewy every time.

Please give us the option to go back to making it the old way before the change! I'd rather it be consistently tender and delicious than have "more chicken" that is overcooked.

I think they changed it to cut costs, but if not I really hope they'll add an option to make it the old way.<//Text>

The food was mostly tasty except the macaroni cheese which was bland and no real flavor and all of it was not hot or fresh. One of the workers asked how we liked our meal and we were honest and he said he would tell the manager. I am sure he did but the manager did not address us at all which I find to be bad cusromer service. My colleague did say something as we were leaving but she was kinda ignored like no comment should have been made in front of other customers or he thought we were looking for a refund or something. The comment was made just to point out something that was wrong with our order. I then texted a good friend of mine and she told me she had tried them to and found the same thing. Food was not hot or seems to have been freshly made. When I came in I said I had enjoyed the place before and came in often when I was in the area. She told me they were a lot better which I found not to be true. I do not think I will try then again being a disappointed customer.</Review>

<Review>My food here at Eureka way was better than the other chicken shack in redding.  Cooked just right, great flavor and good service.   The keto option is what keeps me coming back!<//Review>< Pics>

Great service. They had what I needed and did a great job. I waited and they were quick and efficient. Inspected my brakes and told me they had another 3000 miles before they needed to be done. It’s my experience that they tell you you need them now and you end up spending money you didn’t need to at the time, but they did not do that to me. They were very professional and kind and I would go back again.< /Text>

I called American Tire Depot on Rosedale Hwy and received courteous service over the phone. When I took our vehicle in I was so pleased by the excellent service from Ulisis, who showed me the problem and explained in layman terms my cars trouble. They repaired my tire for free and gave me a great deal on an oil change. I was taken back honestly by such friendly, expedient, and caring service! I definitely would recommend!</review>

<Text>I drove from Yosemite National park with my spare tire replacing my flat one, drove through Fresno to Bakersfield due to American tire store having the special size and brand of tire I needed, not only that, the gentleman at the back counter, courteously enough price matched  the price minus 5%,  from a competitor store. Service was quick, with good attitude and since he saw my truck parked on the street with a fifth wheel trailer hitched up to it, he got back on the road no more than 30 minutes. If you’re in there neighborhood and you need their help, do not hesitate to give them your business, I experienced, courtesy, honesty and most of all respect. Thank you guys at American tire, we got home to San Diego safe and with a spare tire back in its compartment !<//Text><gmapID>0x80ea424dfb612577:0xa20442de3ab6df2< /gmapID><Name>Juan Quijada<//Name>< Response>

We’ve been customers for a long time. We buy our vehicles tires there and have them serviced as well. We heard about what happened to one of their employee’s (Abelardo Bonilla), and we don’t agree with how the company handled the situation. Well they just lost our business. We hope this matter is resolved.</Text>

<Review>I found American Tire Depot via the internet!  I chose them because they have a great rating and reviews!  The Manager CHON answered and went ABOVE and BEYOND helping me find the correct tire with great care in attempting to fit MY NEEDS AND WANTS with SAFETY in mind!  I arrived the next day and it was extremely BUSY!  What was more valuable to a bug purchase was thier system!  He was running, organizing, inspecting everything!  They system was perfectly executed!  The time frame was spot on and simply A WELL OILED MACHINE!  The organization was perfect and I believe if not run so efficiently this business would suffer!
This is an amazing team from the check in to the auto bays!
An effective crew with customer service in mind...thats the focus!  I'll continue driving 2 hours away fir such great service!
Chon and his right hand man at check met my every expectation!  Even Momma was happy spending $800 bucks!</Review>< Pics>

<Review>My tire rep, Chone, made the transaction epic! Most of our transaction took place by phone and looking at tires online. He was able to give me accurate estimates and help me find the tire that was right for my vehicle. When we took the vehicle in, he had his text working on it almost right away and got us in and out while we waited. Their prices are excellent on tires and service and they really know how to treat their customers!</Review>< pics>

Came in as a walk-in about possible front end issues...
They were courteous, down to earth, thorough, and knowledgeable. They asked all the right questions which led them to the problem.
Long story short no problem with front end. They adjusted my tires and gave me a fair priced quote on a new tire needed as they found a slice too big to repair in unrelated back tire.
Totally a no pressure environment.
They have my business and future referral as I was referred to them by a guy friend.
Thank you!</text>

<review>My only gang up is I figured they would carry 4 of the lower range tires in 25/65-15 at least in stock because there are people out there that are barely making it or like in my case I'm helping out someone who is just a friend who has no money, kids in the car and a belt /cord flapping around off of tire. Looked online and they "carry"  brands listed 33.95 each buy 4 they are 25.99 each. But they dont have at either store in Bakersfield- wait till monday is what they said. So I had to buy 2 instead of 4 at a higher price for a better but not wanted brand.still 4 stars because it is great service but bad corporate or local management</review></record></dataset><record>

I took my sons car in for 4 tires. The work was completed quickly and there was no upselling. I appreciated the honesty that his brakes were close to needing replaced but not to that point yet. His car was out of alignment but again there was no pressure to do one just letting us know what they found. We opted to get the alignment done. I appreciated the professionalism.<//review>

I can't speak to the pricing, because I didn't go anywhere else for estimates.  I paid 3700 for tires, brakes, shocks, radiator flushing, spark plugs, and a few other services that I may not remember.  The service was fast and the manager was very accommodating.  They provided me with transportation and were honest with what my truck needed.  I still need to go back for my 30 day follow up, but it seems I'm a little late.  I would recommend.<//Text>

< review>
Best prices in town bar none! Went online late in the afternoon and submitted my order and an appointment all at the same time for next day service. Tires had to be ordered and were promised the next day even when my specific tires were all backordered from the many tire shops in town. There was another Big Box store, won't mention the name *cough*costcough*😉 that could get them in 2-5 business days but they were going to cost a bit more. I'll tell you I got a hell of a deal on K02's with alignment! The store manager really took care of me. The guys are professionals and are hard at work. They got me in and out in a little over an hour. Take advantage of their Buy 3 Get 1 Free Tire Promotion! I didn't need anything else serviced from the shop, granted I can do my own brakes and other suspension work. If your looking for great service, deals and friendly professionals come check out the folks here on Rosedale Hwy American Tire Depot! They have a flat screen tv for entertainment, refreshments and a vending machine in the waiting/lobby area. The Air Conditioning works great as well! Stay fresh and cool from this Bakersfield heatwave while you get fast and friendly service at a great deal! Highly recommend.</review>

Only took us like 6 hours to make it home having to drive 45mph home. Contacted the shop on stine they promised they would fix it. They did not fix it after having it for 3 days. For them to lie to me and tell me it was good. It still drove bad. So I tried one more time. I didnt like that I had to tell him that some one else did it but in the end I was told everything that was wrong that the other to did not say a word. Very happy with chom beas. I would tell anyone to go and talk to him. Thank you</text>< pics>

< Review>
Okay this place got me at first with their tires deals last year in June, so I changed all 4 of my tires with them. 6months later, the driver tire is flat and I am having the car towed out there for them to figure out what happened. They did everything they could and they told me there was nothing wrong with my tire. Approximately a month later the same tire is flat again. Now this time I towed the car there and they are telling me there's a nail in there and that it can't be fixed and the tire needs to be changed. I was like how come you didn't catch it he 1st time, and how come the nail cannot be fixed? The manager I believe David is his name (at the Rosedale store) tells me exactly this  " When you came in January to fix your flat tire I wasn't there yet." I was like really! As a manager does it matter whether you were there yet or not? Isn't it the same company you are working for? Guess what guys, I walk in there and I recognize him as the same person who helped me when I went there back in January for the same flat Tire. He was shocked that recognized him because he had told me then that he moved from Santa Maria or somewhere like that and he was looking for a house to purchase..Can you imagine a manager speaking like that to a customer who is having to tow his car twice there?
So they made me pay for a brand new tire installation, some other shops told me they could have fixed the nail instead...
Anyway I left the car there and I told them I would send someone to pick it up the same day or the next day. The next day they call me saying that I needed to come pick up my car urgently because it's parked in a handicapped spot. I was like wait, you guys parked the car there not me so why should I be under pressure to rush to come and pick it up if you parked it at the wrong place. He tells me that they need a specific pick up time coz BPD can come to tow it! So after the 1st hustle with them, they find another way to give me more headaches....Who does that to their new customer?.. Poor , Poor Customer service!!<//Review>

Great service and a great price for 4 brand new tires, thanks guys. The only issue I had was I went to their store yesterday after I was told they had my tires in stock just to find out that they didn't and I had to come back today. Thanks again.</Text>

David was professional and easy to work with.  Special order snow tires arrived earlier than anticipated!  Only negative,  would have liked bags on our regular tires that we took home with us, like they did at the Santa Monica location 3 years ago when we bought previous snow tires from them.</review>

I am a GM for a electronics repair company. I have mobile vans running around every day. Had one of my colleagues bring in a van to get a service. Oil service and tire rotation. My guy was in and out in about 30-45 with no problems.

I was traveling from another city to come down and pay for the services they provided and they cut my guy loose to go back out and continue his day.

I arrived and they matched my price of service from another ATD in Visalia where I have more vans that have been serviced. These guys are killer fast, courteous, and professional.

My business vans will be brought here for all services going forward.

Thank you ATD.<//text>

<text>Was told I needed a new Transmission by Pep Boys because my car was stuttering. Stopped by this place, Todd the manager went for a ride with me and let me know my Catalitic Converter was most likely plugged, and to have an exhaust shop run a pressure test. He recommended one for me across town. Just had it replaced at an exhaust shop, thanks for the honesty guys. Saved me 4k. I will be back for sure.<//text>< Pics>

I purchased a brand new set of tires for my F-150 here. After not having luck at a couple other shops because my tires are an uncommon size, Todd the manager, went out of his way to personally pick up the tires I needed from their warehouse across town and had them installed in no time. I was blown away with the awesome customer service this shop provided. All the mechanics were very friendly and would strike up conversation. 12/10 would recommend this shop to others. The prices were way better than anywhere I looked at too. I was blown away!< /text>

I don’t leave many reviews but after today I really wanted to. i was in this store 2 weeks ago, it was not a friendly environment, i walk in today and the whole showroom/waiting room had been changed around,new tires up, cleaned up, maybe even painted?  I met the new manager i think his name was Todd. what a breath of fresh air, no need for a book, i bought 4 tires, and set an appointment for next week to service my transmission and radiator. well done on the changes management, i’ll be a regular along with everyone i tell!!< /text>

<text>I have come here since my first set of tires, and probably always will. I recommend these guys to everyone I know. They are respectable, friendly and definitely know their product. I have dealt with different employees over time, but my most recent visit, Ulysses (I hope I spelled his name right), made sure I received the best deal and kept me informed of my cars progress. I like that they actually show you the changes made on your vehicle and answer any questions you have. Please check these guys out for a quote, they are willing to work with you.<//text>< pictures>

<review>I love the service at American Tire Depot.
Ulysis and Robert gave me great customer service. i have been in 3 times in the last few weeks with my tire sensore light coming on. Robert convinced me to switch to nitrogen in my tires and i have not had any problems since. Then  came the 2 nails in my tire and they patched me up till my order for a new tire came in the next day. I truly appreciate the excellent service and low price.
Keep up the good work.
Happy customer Andrea and her car Onyx</review>< Rating>

My daughter and I came in for tires. Todd went above and beyond for us.After the free full inspection  We decided to have them do some of the work for us that day, since we did not live in town Todd actually gave us his truck “A very nice truck by the way” for the day!! We drove around and got all of our shopping done. A couple of the items we ran out of time for we will have done down south at a sister store for ATD.  Thank again this is class act customer service!
Ps. I wouldn’t want to pay the gas bill for that truck every week!</review>

Now this is how customer service is done. Kudos to the manager for greeting & thanking the customers for our business. Fast friendly and extremely accommodating.  I'm here in the shop right now watching how the associates deal with, listen to and go over everything with the customers. Xavier has helped me from the initial phone call to in store customer service. If they keep this mentality and work ethic word will spread and this company will grow. I myself work in customer service and this is how it's supposed to be done.< /Text>

Arrived in the morning of August 5th to get a full set of tires replaced for my 2014 Toyota Camry.  I ended up waiting for almost 5 hours to get them replaced after inventory mishaps and delivery errors I had almost decided to leave when they managed to get the 4th tire for my vehicle.  This btw wasn't the first time this had happened, under a previous manager I waited from open to close to have my tires changed if it wasn't for the deal I was getting on the tires I would leave it at a lower rating.  I have also still yet to receive my email with my warranty receipt after waiting 5 days.

Needless to say after this warranty is out on these tires these will be the last tires I get from this center.

8/14/19
Talked to the "manager" on 8/12/19 at approximately 7:30pm was notified that he would be talking to the store for my warranty receipt and that I would have it by the next day.  Fast forward to today, no phone call and no email on the status of my warranty receipt.</Review>

These guys were amazing.  Richard, in the office went over and above to get me everything I needed from tires all the way around to new brakes.  Excellent price!  The guys did their best to get me everything I needed in a timely manner for all the work they perfomed.  I even got a free oil change.!  Thank you so much for all your help today guys.... I feel like I am driving a new car!

EXCELLENT JOB!

This place helped me out since I’ve been able to drive and always has great customer service! Place in Arryo Grande however was completely awful service and was completely rude once they found out I was getting tires at the Bakersfield store later on. All I wanted the beach location to do was fix my flat and his only agenda was to sell me a full set even though we repeatedly said no. I had a warranty on my tires that had a nail in it and he didn’t even look in the computer to check if it was still valid so instead of going there we went to big brand in Arroyo Grande. Thankfully the Bakersfield store always has great service or I would have never came back to them and gone to another tire shop.</text>

<time>1525187878366<//time><Review>Had the unfortunate event of having car problems while 3,000 miles away from home. A local mechanic recommended American Tire Depot and I couldn't be more pleased with their services. They were able to fit me in immediately on the weekend, and do a full inspection of the vehicle. They pretty quickly identified the problems, and were able to get the parts on the same day and gave me several discounts on parts and labor. They put 2 mechanics on the car to do an unbelievable amount of work on the car in just a few hours and stayed a little after closing to make sure they could get the work done in the same day for me. They even replaced my windshield wipers for free. Incredibly friendly and trustworthy service and I would recommend them to anyone - I wish I lived closer because they were more thorough than my local mechanic.</Review></record>

We the Maino family was impress with store manager Frisco for helping us with our tires, alignment, and 3 years warranty for our tires. Good customer service, helping with choosing the great tires and going out of his way on helping us with our tire situation, we brought two vehicles to get 4 new tires on both cars. I would recommend his company to
Others and I would go back and buy tires from him again. Thank you Frisco God bless Da Maino family.</text>

<Text>Went in to purchase 2 front tires and the age kept pushing a set of 4. He quoted me a price for 2 American made tires and then switched them with another brand and never told me.  The car was so out of alignment after they charged me to align it that I went to another tire shop to have it done correctly.  The guy who worked on my car left the steering wheel greasy and ruined the pants I was wearing.< /Text>< response>

By the time I was done paying, while getting an estimate of a set for my friends car.  They were done and already had the tire loaded up and ready to go.  Good business!  Whole crew present participated in answers to my questions.  Hard to find good business these days.  Rosedale location.  Thanks fellas. I will b back.< /text><pics>None<//pics>< response>

<text>This place is the absolute WORST.
LADIES DO NOT GO HERE.
I went in for a simple oil change on a 2012 dodge avenger sxt plus that I literally drove off the Dodge lot 3 weeks ago. I prefer to switch out oils once I buy a car from a dealer, no big deal just a personal preference of mine.
They quoted me $19.99 on the phone but once I got there they charged me for a fuel filter before even looking at my car and extra for oil "it's a V6 we charge extra" even though I asked on the phone if it was the same price for a v6. And of course I asked him to put something down so he didn't get gross material all over new seats which he didn't. In fact when I asked he rolled his eyes. So there's a fat boot print on my floor, dirt and oil all over my door, gear shift and u-connect radio. YOU CAN RUIN THE U-CONNECT LCD SCREEN WITH OIL BTW. And on top off ALL that they bring in an air filter and said it was mine and needed to be changed for an extra $30 . . . I literally checked the filter 2 weeks ago . . . There's no way in hell it could've been covered in oil and dripping if there wasn't something majorly wrong with my engine to begin with. Further more when I denied wanting it changed the old man standing behind the counter mocked me. Real professional. Worst customer service. I won't be going back to them because obviously they treat you like you're an idiot if you're a female because they were doing the same to the 2 other women that were there in the lobby as well, but the men? In-out no "extra problems".</text></record>

I've taken my truck here before, and always had issues with waiting for hours after it was supposed to be ready. Front service people and manager were always nice, but everything was sooo slow! I took my truck in today for brakes and found out that there's a new manager, Martin. He assured me that he could have my truck ready within two hours. Sure enough, two hours later, I was on the road again. GREAT customer service! GREAT price! AND speedy, efficient work! Martin has done a great job fixing up past complaints on slow work, which makes American Tire Depot the best value for your money! I would recommend this place to anyone! Thanks Martin!<//text>

Nice guys but they are not the brightest bulbs. One guy told me to ignore my squeaky breaks and it will go away after an oil change. Several weeks later it cost me 800 bucks to get my breaks fixed since it was now down to the metal.

My advice is to get the manager to make a diagnosis and when they change your oil watch them like a hawk or just go to Walmart.</Review>

<review>I bought brand new tires. When I picked my car up, they told me they stripped a lugnut bolt on one of my back tires. It's been a couple months and I had to take my tire off( the same one they stripped the bolt on) and come to realise that not only did they strip my bolt but they knowingly stripped ( crossthreaded) my lugnut bolts. It was something they knew about before they sent me on my way with my car because the bolts just keep turning when you try to tighten them. But they we're careless and they left the loose nuts on my car. I only had two good lugnuts holding my tire on this whole time .I am so upset as this is the place that I go to get my tires. They have always given me great service . Either they have different mechanics working there or something but I will never go there again. Their inconsiderate actions could have caused me and my son our lives.< /review>< Gmap_id>

Changed out my control arms and went to get an alignment, they said it was going to take 2 hrs and 70 bucks so I left and got a call back saying they need to tighten the bolts and the price is going to be $329.....to tighten 12 bolts $329....I picked my truck up and went down the street to CT&W and they re opened the shop and did the job for $80< /Text>

< Review>
My tire was "too old to be repaired" at this place. He said my only option was to buy new ones. I called other places and they all said thats not a thing. Even better, the guy at the counter and the guy in front of me talked about fast and the furious for 10 minutes while there was a line behind me.</Review>

<text>HORRIBLE SERVICE!
08/18/2016 I scheduled an appointment to have my breaks checked at 1:00pm. Arrived at 1:01pm. No one was in the lobby and no cars were on blocks being worked on. I was informed the break inspection would take 15-20min max, I told the cashier that I had to be back at work by 2:00pm, he assured me it would not take that long. At 12:44 pm i asked the cashier what the status of my car was because they still have not told me if i needed new breaks. The cashier came back at 12:50pm and informed me they did not have a chance to look at my car and I could wait if I wanted to and they were sorry they were busy. I highly recommend receiving services elsewhere. The cashier was very apologetic but the offer of me to just keep waiting after I have already been waiting an hour in the lobby past my appointment time is unacceptable and unnecessary when I was the only car there upon arrival.</text><name>Amanda Harris< /name><Date>1471554441867<//Date><GmapID>0x80ea424dfb612577:0xa20442de3ab6df2<//GmapID><Rate>1< /Rate><UserId.>111435470665645285272</UserId.></record></dataset><record>

This is my first review on Google +.  I have used American Tire Depot for the last 3 sets of tires for both my Truck and my wife's SUV.  What I like about these guys is they work with you, within your budget... They don't try and upsell and instead focus on what you need or want.  There prices have always been good, the first set I bought, I price checked with several other local places and they were the lowest so I've felt confident with them ever since.  Honest guys and easy going.  I gave it a Good on Appeal, cause honestly, the place is small and older looking.  But the money they save on the building the pass on to you in the prices.

My wife just bent the rim on her SUV, they gave really good prices on new rims but also mentioned a few places I could find used Rims.  I found a great set of used Rims and now they are putting them on for me today.  Never once did I feel I put them out not buying from them, and when I need new tires again, I will be going here.<//Text>

They did not attach my bmw wheel cap correctly and it obviously came off, which I noticed when I got home 50 miles away. I called and they seemed sincere to find me another, but it has been weeks now. Not happy, that cap never came off before, only after tires were changed. Disappointed.<//text>

<user_name>Nick Hill<//user_name><time>1467923806059<//time><rate>1</rate><review>Recently got two new tires here and I have a long list of complaints. First of all they put the wrong size tires on so I had to go back to get the right ones on. They broke a stud and didn't tell me about it, and they also cross threaded another. Some of my lugnuts have caps on them and all those were missing when I picked up the car. Also each lugnut has a washer and a spring. They installed them incorrectly and put all the springs on one lugnut instead of one on each. I told them to give me back one of the old tires, which they did but they still charged me a disposal and recycle fee for two tires. When I was in the waiting room I overheard the guys at the counter talking about how hot a customer's voice sounded on the phone and wondering what she looked like. Seems like the guys running this place are more concerned with getting some than actually doing the job you pay them to do. The people here are unprofessional and their mechanics are careless. If you value the parts on your car and expect a quality job don't go here. You will be very disappointed.  This is the first and last time they'll get my business.<//review>< pictures>

You get the good and the bad with these guys, they are very very extemely slow but they do have the cheapest tires in town and if not will beat all competitors even if they don't make any profit. I would suggest if going with them drop off the car and get picked up and don't expect it till the end of the day. The guy isn't rude but they do up sell scare you to buy thing which all mechanic does. In the end they tried to scam me, been doing business with them for over 2 years now, im done with them.<//Text>

I showed up with all wheels completely oposite of eachother and im very pleased to say ricky made sure to get me out of there as fast as possible. Id say it took him about 15 minutes to do so. I appreciate the care the took towards my car being it so low, they carefully drove it up no problem and the men were thourough in making sure i was happy with my new alignment. He asked me to drive it around the corner to get a feel for it and it was as perfect as he could get it. With my blown tierods, that he suggested be replace as soon as possible.Definitely recommending this shop to anyone who simply needs any tire and alignment work they do an azaming job. I will be bringing my other cars and friends right back to, Ricky at American tire for every service!< /review>

<text>Very irresponsible! They changed the strut and tires then redid the alignment. The tire came off so I had the car towed there and they claimed to have fixed it. About a week later, while driving, the car started to make a noise so I went to a shopping center to check it and sure enough the tire was almost out of place again! This is very hazardous and could have lead to a big disaster if I didn't have a chance to stop and check! This is unacceptable!!< /text><pics>None< /pics><resp>None<//resp>< Gmap_id>

Very unprofessional told me that they would not fix my tire because it was too old. The date code on the tire says it was 2 years old rip-off don't go here. He had no clue I knew how to read the tire date code. Just wanted to sell me a new set. He never even looked for a nail.</Review>

This place is absolutely terrible. They put friends first. We sat there for an hour and a half for one tire and watched as two people behind us got done first. Then when everyone left and we were clearly watching what was on tv they changed the channel. Don't go here!< /Review>

Eloisa Villaseñor was awesome with my hair. She trimmed it just like I wanted. I recently underwent radiation treatments and lost some hair in front of my right ear. She evened out the left side so it wasn't so noticeable. Haircut Headquarters has a very friendly atmosphere. I highly recommend it.<//Text>

If you want an amazing haircut ask for Alyjandra! She does really good, and my hair is hard to cut. One side needs to be combed forward, the other side needs to be combed down. And I have a cowlick on the front and back. If you don't cut, comb or style it right it will stick up like a bed head. My hair is much harder to deal with than most and she manages to make it look great! She deserves big tips.

I went to this place, the first time I got a rude lady but she is not there anymore. I always ask for Alyjandra, and I am never disappointed with her!<//text>

Sometimes you can just walk in and have a seat, but it's a hit and miss. I definitely would recommend you making an appointment here, these gals are very popular. It's a very professional establishment and all the ladies here are absolute sweethearts. They absolutely work miracles here. I bring in my son one way, and I swear I'm walking out with a totally different kid. I recommend them! Thier the best family Salon in town.</review>

<text>Always have had a good cut here at the normal 16.00 plus tip. Have had three different stylists and all friendly except for today. Mary gave me a good cut but she was not very friendly as the previous ones have been. Smile and talk to your customer Mary it is already awkward to have a stranger in your hair and your silence did not help. Will be back but will ask for a different stylist next time.< /text><pics>None</pics><resp>None</resp>< gmap_id>

Great place to take the family for haircuts. My kids and I always go here. The new owner Eloisa is doing a great job with the place. When you go ask for Tricia or Martha they do great work and they always remember my name and what size clippers to use. I highly recommended this place.< /Review>

I called to make an appointment (I've never been to this place before) and the woman who answered the phone seemed annoyed when I asked for a cut and color and became agitated when I was explaining what I wanted done. Bad first impression, will not be going here for services if they are too bothered to do their job<//Text>

<Review>I've been going here for years. Disappointing last two visits. My last visit I came in unknowingly on a Sunday five minutes before closing. One employee was clearly upset. I apologized and tried to say I'd come back another time but the other employee insisted I stay. Of course the upset employee did my hair rather quickly and poorly and unhappily. I've been fixing it for weeks as it wasn't finished properly. I've been thinking about this all month of course as I clip off pieces that didn't make the first cut. I wish they would have just let me come back another time instead of insisting it was okay to stay. I really don't feel like ever going back now.< /Review><resp>None</resp>< pics>

< review>
For years, I've been to a variety of other salons, and have repeatedly been disappointed. I've had my hair severely burned with perms, color that was way wrong or washed out on the first washing, haircuts that were lopsided or not even close to what I was wanting, and the list goes on. I've brought my son her for 15 years. My husband has come here for 15 years. I tried it several years ago, but when I tried to come back to get the same stylist I was told I couldn't do that. So, I've been all over, until a several months ago. I came back here and gave them a chance with me, again. The stylist was one of, if not the best, I've ever had. She cut my hair perfectly. She colored it the way I wanted it. She understood what I was going for, and how to get my hair there. She was friendly, respectful, efficient, and very skilled. I can make appointments with her, or just walk in. It is wonderful. All staff are friendly, helpful, and knowledgable. They also carry lines of hair care that work. They are not overly costly, as some salons sell. I highly recommend this Salon, especially, Tricia. She rocks.<//review>

My hair is not normal and can be easily ruined during a haircut if the barber is not very careful as it grows in many directions.
The wait is never too long, the shop is clean, lots of parking, great restaurants near by, right off of the freeway, small play area for kids, large TV and more.
I have only allowed 4 barbers to cut my hair in 56 years and Eloisa is the fourth.

I have come here for over a year now, I always get my hair cut by Homa, but all the employees have been positive  and friendly in my experience, haircut either come out or grows out very nicely at an affordable price.< /review>

<review>I was here on October/ 25/20.
No parking fee, no bathroom, no entrance fee.
It is 4 miles there& back, around 520ft of elevation gain.
The road leading to the lake is very rough and require 4WD.
The trail is 100 % no shade, dirt and dry, very boring hike.
I was lucky, I got a ride from local family.( father and 2 kids),they are very nice people, we payed them for round trip.
The lake is so gorgeous and Mammoth Mountain across the way makes it’s incredible phenomenon views.
I was walking though those pillars,  they are so unique, some of the columns about 20 ft tall,  with some of them standing as erect as towering pylons,  and sporting ringed apertures approximately a foot apart, another which are warped or leaning at various angles, and some can go all the way back, resemble the petrified remains of dinosaur.
This place could be tourist destination, It is some kind of the beauty that you have to see yourself.</review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPQpzRQh7S2uvsQh9QDvkVB0c3ZqOleZPjceSiE=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNzAY8JhmPIVch75-NRRIisrO0qObsnQj0ZpYG_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOeR3YMK8Lp1n1-5pjmtwF6oiTNp10VWwmK0PAt=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPc3mr1-XXUWLM2WY52w0a2w94nsBwxvsE8TpuT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPahz84ssx7_XIr5F3XzTkiX1h1ygBtQ__v683V=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMlqMdjsk2aYQS8LvfGEZOmpUmg7pIkrLR61g4q=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOL1mPYDnA0mdhIyIGoOdkuQfJK6KCJgyo8nop0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPw3XXoMYLM6VrBTFDQgZeCcx7fzSC5o3IP7tdU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN8sRZVXHYuM2SHWdqAa7B6e2BbqBdignhRJZCB=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNyLOVYqPcPMzsHxp0oi1xnC34zJbCH6Ub3ax8A=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNw3km-JRE1ZAeO8iU1azsa8WdI94gnr4DTC8pe=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOtp3FLAc8PPHA0Y5W51024GGbtZJI1d0a5FFS_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNdnHtHyl_H1vwzqZPC_VmTcaPQCVn2iWguj5VC=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPJmo5eDMkycGya6D2lHQ9Ik_ekb_VGS0X1KhO0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOIM4xIR6DJbL0zxluokanHMWmr-C_v6yeKD5Dr=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMqq2tVhesm-4ssKENh-F9Vz84Mw7O-LNfhjv-K=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMWcnjSz6Q9gwAchOHeD_dtFNqoRgmCFXwOpdEv=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMZ-pJxyIawGXg60hyz3Y8VnYuY2ggL6XXut9pr=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN_KI0i20eayOO6aKFcnpGaXqaWnHC2BHWOneZ9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN0NmFK0blhT1euO51dh62bIZwx-PoKuweuKLeq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOuyNiCK6kA_L67JJybWx4iT8rOzCxHUMh3lTzR=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPi-r71Skfa3q_6_RnLdhEtqKZ76WFX-4QYmqNh=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPO3mScVOM37PCVa0pJsbRqbnTF04uKtJ4wFjA7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP16hyQrSJW987z_qW24nROIEdYTkr-lEvkmSp2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMhyWaNPyvcCGSnlHXmLGRChdy7ySFk5xBaPF0K=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMoFsXCU0tf22j9yF-RIUaahRT1pLcp1Bugqf5n=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMJusEGFCzaG7GsYkiO4b9JqRD-BkLbNTd9Ueye=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM__dSa9DJ4F7nc6mYYpc5Mrt0ie6mtezDoOMHd=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMMiiTFqWe_iiJQflTyW-YyyndEQ_X6kcgchJB_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNoeuEl0APyKyxw2pA5C1ycCgA51uHKsyvmwZH8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMg2gMNm2DpzMrSwiFQOQRtnKLfnhGoWDbv-pNw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMIFaz1ZP5Yc_ec6VaiKwefbz57duOJ1Jei21JR=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPUJaKcGer3cTWu5Gwog_sCwmuuyfOpWA0izLX0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPbApPeCs2HVufmmOe9CI1dbfDQhao04DiWea1m=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN20fATIgnkoOCqdWs3nVMayxGYf-HRPyU2npHJ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO9dr9NgzEIcvbhh871bIkRJd9K9z0XBxWXPUvI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNtcRkJVZt484l9eAI_ZqR5KtoidzrebS3hhU8d=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPrALV6KRb7dm08vwF1Q5GFeT50TxKE8tVGOxde=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPqGee2dlulXx4sIZjoJKPd6uYEf5mzIhqrghD3=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP-wa3BMiww0a7_pA-4_yEYPPbjFBaq4i18kS5B=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNVnNLLZl6XxMqKdkl4iHPrwg-uuPbVkTbBRW1B=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMi566JGQj-_YQ1fI6X_HIDsyxR-gTCjKF2liWl=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< Response>

<Review>We went to the stone columns. Beware it is either a 2 mile off-roading or hike with no shade what so ever. Carry more water than you think you would need and sun protection. At the end of the road there is a steep climb down to the shore with the columns. The columns themselves are beautiful and amazing. The views are great too.<//Review>< Response>

< review>
I've driven past Crowley Lake many times, but somehow I can't remember if I've ever gotten down to the water's edge. It's a beautiful lake surrounded by the mighty Sierra Nevada and White mountains. It's a popular fishing spot. I usually prefer to venture out to the lakes at higher elevations. This is a great view as seen from McGee Creek Trailhead.<//review>

The Eastern High Sierra's are where God rested on the Seventh Day. This place is phenomenal! It has everything you could want: Alpine Lakes, forbidding granite mountains, blue-ribbon fishing, sapphire lakes, hiking, diverse & unique landscape, world class skiing, unspoiled wilderness, deep forests, and the cleanest air and water! My favorites are Crowley in the south, Tahoe in the center, and Eagle lake in the north. Go there. Now. Your spirit will be refreshed and and your troubles will be far away.< /review>

(Translated by Google) 🏞 Crawley Lake Narut is a great lake for photographing and fishing and boating. First of all, it is difficult to go to see the peculiar lime pillar (similar to the limestone) and to go through the bulge and the dirt road that protrudes out of reach. Unfortunately, ten thousand and 🚨SUV 4-wheel drive vehicles. Next is where entry is possible.

(Original)
🏞 크롤리 호수 나룻터는 사진을 찍기에 좋고, 낚시와 보트를 타기에 좋은 아주 큰 호수이다. 먼저특이한 석회기둥(석주와비슷)을 보러 가다가 🚘세단으로는 갈수없는 불룩하게 튀어나온 큰돌과 비포장도로를 가기가 어렵다. 아쉽지만 포기하고 다음에.. 🚨SUV 4륜구동 차량만 진입이 가능한 곳이다.< /review>

< Review>
I lived in the San Gabriel area for many years and never stopped to try this little gem out.  Yesterday I was wanting a good burger from somewhere and thought to try this place.  You can tell this place has been here for many years which makes it even more special.  Had a double cheeseburger with avocado slices and turned out to be the best, most satisfying experience I’ve had in a long time.  I’m curious to try out the rest of the menu but by far, so far, the burger experience I had with that charbroiled flavor will not disappoint.  Let’s try and keep this place open for more years to come!< /Review>

I honestly like their dishes and customer service, good area nearby to my home. The employees are always kind. Will come visit again.< /text>

<review>as much as I want to support a small local business during this time, this place needs serious sanitation improvements.

1. The guy making our food wasn't wearing a mask or gloves.

2. It also looks like "cleaning their hands" involves wiping them quickly on the same rag (I didn't see water or soap used but I could have missed that).

3. I asked for sanitizer and they apparently didn't have any which I don't care about for my own use, but what does that say about the people making your food?

4. He then made a salad with his bare hands, and then picked up the phone and a pen and wrote down another order, then went back to salad making without washing.

Honestly, not sure if I should be more worried about coronavirus or ecoli.

I'm torn to add this review because supporting local businesses during this time is important, but I need to know that the places I eat at are doing the bare minimum to stop the spread and keep people healthy.</review><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None< /Response>< gmap_id>

Awesome avocado chicken sandwich combo, home made french fries and a lemonade to go with it. Very satisfied 😋☺😎 because it was freshly made and the chicken was juicy and grilled.  Well worth the $10.00 dollars.< /review>

Our first time here, we ordered the ceviche and frankly was the best we had around Santa Clarita, fresh, succulent and fairly price, these bad reviews must be from losers from other restaurants, this place is doing a great job. Highly recommend.< /Text>

Not so happy about this place.  The so called  "seviche" is not even close to deserved to be call seviche. It was more tomato, onions and cucumber salad with a minimum amount of fish in it.. and the same goes for the octopus cocktail.. Very disappointed..< /review>

<Text>This restaurant hasn't been here Very Long. Formerly Fat & Juicy which didn't make it and I'm so bummed I never got to try it.  The flavor of my Burrito was Excellent. Although I had them make it Regular; with Rice, beans, etc.  Typically I just do Meat Only.  Which the flavor of their Carne Asada is Phenomenal!  A bit on the pricey side compared to Other Local favourites, but perhaps because they deal with Tons of Seafood at this restaurant.  It's funny because I originally was going to Arby's and thought, nah... too plain.  So I went into Yoshinoya, and Just wasn't feeling it.  Third time was a Charm and Las Delicias Deserves the 5 Staf Rating that I just gave them.  Let's keep their doors open!  Give them a whirl, and I think you'll enjoy it!</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

Haven't been to DZ Akins during covid times. Have always enjoyed it in the past.
Went there on Saturday at noon. The place was a zoo and the waiters looked tired.. Our table took awhile to get someone assigned but the host came by to take drink orders and get someone to help us. We weren't in a hurry so and recognize when people are overwhelmed.
I had the Roast Beef and Ortega sandwich with macaroni salad. My mom had a hamburger and brother the Pastrami.  All 3 of us enjoyed the food and the waitress was great and attentive.  She been there a long time as I recognized her from the past and have forgotten her name. They all wore masks and as far as I could see, everyone around us seemed pleased.
DZ Akins is a great place to take mom or a date. It has some really tasty food and is pretty reasonably priced.
Now if I could just remember her name!<//review>

<review>Dz Akins is an all around eating restaurant the menu is a novel and it is to hard to choose I spend 20 minutes just on bakery items.  Try an egg cream my parents favorite. Try The Ted Lietner or the chicken and waffles. Black and white cookies. You will enjoy. That you can order everything to go including bakery good . Just call ahead or go through delivery service you will love it< /review><resp>None<//resp>< Date>

<Text>This place was amazing.  The menu selection is massive.  The prices seem a little high, but the dishes are easily enough to split between people or meals.  The service was extremely quick and the staff was very uplifting.  This will definitely be a new family spot for us, whether for full meals, drinks, or even just desserts.< /Text><gmap_id>0x80d956f1769222eb:0x8de1ab4c735f7005< /gmap_id><pictures>None< /pictures>< userid>

< Review>
Our first visit was already amazing. The are very COVID compliant and neat. Customers were being let into the store maybe 3-4 at a time? They were very patient with us as it was our first time. Seeing the big menu and bakery/deli items is pretty overwhelming, but they will answer any questions you have! We were recommended the eclair, so we got that along with some other goodies to accompany our meals. The sandwich is PACKED and can honestly feed 2 adults...but I was hungry 😂 their omelette meal is super tasty, and probably the most flavorful I've tasted. I'm sure the rest of their menu is just as delish, and we can't wait to try the rest of it.<//Review>

<Text>Used to eat here all the time, then moved away 8 years ago.  Prices are pretty high, but sandwiches and portions are HUGE. Still, it's clear that there have been no updates (booths/ carpeting/decor) in the last 8 years, and it was a little shabby before.  Looking threadbare and shopworn.  Nevertheless, my bowl of Barley Soup and "small" ham sandwich ($14) were delicious -- and had GREAT service from Tiffany!< /Text><gmapID>0x80d956f1769222eb:0x8de1ab4c735f7005< /gmapID><name>Mark McLean</name><Pictures>None< /Pictures></record>

<Text>DZ Akins has one of the most elaborate food menus I have ever seen. There's a little bit of something for everyone. They also have a great deli for some quick take out as well as a bakery full of cookies,  brownies, pastries, bread, etc. I highly recommend this place to anyone.</Text>< pics>

We have eaten here many times when we go to San Diego because we love their food so much, especially their hot sandwiches, they have a huge assortment of Jewish deli and bakery goodies. Indoor or outdoor dining, totally recommend just take a sweater if you sit outside because when that cool sea air comes across their it is chilly but fresh.<//review>

<review>I love DZ Akins. I went to the bakery to get a chocolate birthday cake.  It was really yummy.  The frosting was like fudge not greasy or heavy lard tasting like other bakery cakes I've had.  Service was great.</review>< rating>

Love this place. Largest menu ever seen anywhere. Everything I have ever ordered on my numerous visits has been delicious. The ingredients are good and the portions are very generous. I've never not had a good meal there.< /review>

This time it was a good experience dining outside.  Best Lox n bagels I've had.  Last time I ordered a sandwich to go. Horrible, dry bread, few veggies on it and soggy coleslaw.< /text>

We shared the two bagels, lox and cream cheese plate and it was delicious! Also tried the pierogies and they were good too. Took home a variety of cookies and they are equally yummy. We will return on our next visit.< /Review>

This place is my preferable restaurant.  Of all restaurants I know I prefere it most. I always suggests to my friends to go to visit this place. when  I I need a good lunch, this place comes straightaway to my mind.  Great and many types of  food and a rich menu.courteous staff members, and good spirit. Also important, the tariff is decent. I recommend this spot with no hesitation.< /Review>

<text>Not sure what all the rave is about. The food we tried was very mediocre. My boyfriend had the Reuben sandwich which he did like. I had the turkey bacon avocado sandwich which was very dry. The bread was thick and tough, turkey was bland and dry. Perhaps other items on the menu are better and I simply made the wrong choice. I would not recommend the turkey bacon avo sandwich. Again, boyfriend enjoyed his Reuben sandwich. It is true that the portion size is large but certainly not worth the amount we paid. Overall, very disappointed having paid $41 for two sandwiches.< /text><Response>None</Response><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOU7dA96iVRatMQGz8ioFZ7yr_o4eiASvefZ5kh=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP-Fup7yx3wDaPkx38ZdTj2s-tAcaQAH7222F1s=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures><username>Cynthia Nguyen< /username><Rating>2< /Rating><user_id>115411035593253573609</user_id>< Gmap_id>

<review>My first visit here. This place was packed on Saturday for lunch, with parking troublesome, but since I was late, a spot opened on my second trip through the maze. Seated outdoors with my friends, there was good service and relatively quick delivery despite the crowd. Portions were huge ( I'm a Bantam-weight with a slow metabolism) trying to handle the #14 sandwich in one sitting. No way! Open faced, I attacked with a fork, between conversing with my friends, and got only partially done, but the waitress brought a take-home carton which I used with relief. Several hours later, still struggled to get it all down, but glad I did. That was an all-day meal for this thin man, but I'd go back again.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><gmapID>0x80d956f1769222eb:0x8de1ab4c735f7005<//gmapID></record>

Best reuben I've had in San Diego. The frosted brownie was very good, kinda cake like but full of flavor. The home made ding dong was good, definitely better than anything hostess could hope to make. The setup there followed all Covid guidelines and the staff was exceptionally friendly and helpful. I think a return visit is needed to explore the large menu and pastry cases further. If you want jewish deli or if you've never been to one I'd say this is the one to go to in San Diego.</Review>

So happy to dine outside at Dz Akins...service was terrific as always. Matzo ball soup was tasty and missed after restaurants were closed for dining...we also shared a grilled tunafish with fries...can't replace that comforting meal. Spoke with the owner and expressed our glee to see they are still here!</review>

I'm from North Jersey originally and had a hard time finding a deli in San Diego that met my very picky standards. This place was not only the best in San Diego but put most of the delis from back home on notice too. It's a bit pricey but until you see the portions you don't realize you're underpaying for the quality and size of the meals you're getting. My wife takes me out for my birthday each year and I could pick any restaurant I wanted but I always pick DZ Akins. Also since covid is a thing now i feel obligated to say they are doing more than other restaurants to create a safe environment for their patrons and I really appreciate that since I'm in a high risk group.<//text>

You feel like family here and the food is fantastic. Our server April was so helpful and friendly. In The honey fried chicken is fantastic as was the skirt steak with mushrooms and onions was excellent! The challah bread was so soft and airy. Onion rings were very crispy and we're great dipped in the homemade thousand island and blue cheese dressings. We have definitely found our favorite Jewish Deli/bakery.< /text>

<Review>ALWAYS fabulous... whether I'm craving their scrumptious french toast or a soothing/healing bowl (or pint) of matzoh ball soup!!
And don't even get me started on that glorious cookie/bakery counter...!!! 😳
A guaranteed $15-20 unnecessary purchase that I simply don't have the will to fight!! And as long as I only allow myself 1-2 per day... they last quite a long time and provide days of delectable comfort 😋
(Their crazy-meaty sandwiches are of course also notorious...
but since I'm not in that area often enough to trade off, my choice is generally gonna always be breakfast-for-dinner!! 😍)</Review>< pictures>

<Review>Always a pleasure. Staff is awesome even during CO vid. We did sit inside great spacing, 4 of us went for a 78 year old birthday, even though I ordered the fried chicken which is something I have never had before there it was OK. The chicken itself was very moist and juicy, although I was not a fan of the breading. The soups and sandwiches are always top notch and again did not disappoint.  Got some to go stuff from the bakery and deli as well. Potato salad is awesome. Bread terrific. Truly the only downfall to this place is the parking, always packed.</Review>< Pics>

Not the DZ Akins I remember. The sandwiches used to be STACKED and fresh. This visit, the meat was processed lunch meat and sparse. Soups bland. Disappointed. May repeat for history sake but not likely to do so soon.</review>

Always great food had a great price with gigantic portions. Wait staff are superb in every way. How could you not love a great deli with wonderful matzo ball soup or a gigantic liverwurst sandwich. I had the navy bean soup today it was absolutely incredible.< /text>

I would have never associated a bacon cheeseburger with DZ Akins. But it was amazing. The service was good and the waitress was very nice and polite. Everyone has a smile on their face and eager to help. The presentation of the food was even great. I noticed other people's orders. I enjoyed myself.</Text>

Waitress was great and gave great service, however the cashier was very rudeand did not seem to care nor except that she can make honest errors when counting money....Money drawer should be checked especially when some of that money should be going to the waitresses!!! Not going there for a long while and the prices are getting higher and food quality getting lower😔BIG SHAME.< /Review>

<text>Brought my boyfriend here for dinner because I grew up eating here. We waited twenty minutes for a $20 sandwich that had frozen avocado and tomato in it. He ended up throwing the sandwich away because of how mediocre it was and we ended up eating Panda Express instead. The quality had definitely declined lately.< /text>< Response>

<Text>DZ Akins has such a varied menu that you can always find some great food.  Today we celebrated my Birthday Club offer for a free dessert with dinner.  I chose one of their chocolate Eclairs.  For my meal I had a New York Strip Steak with eggs, onion rings and chocolate chip muffin. Barbara had her favorite Corned Beef on Rye with a Green Salad. Carrot Cake for dessert.</Text><Gmap_id>0x80d956f1769222eb:0x8de1ab4c735f7005</Gmap_id><Rate>5<//Rate>< user_name>

<rating>2< /rating><Review>Employees are all super nice. Food is definitely sub-standard. For a $20 sandwich I realized I could make one better at home. Meat is as dry as the Sahara - doesn’t glisten and has the appearance of dry paper. Truly. Also, it was take out and they either forgot all the condiments or just fear good flavors. Literally no mayo or mustard or ANYTHING. I’m 36 and was the youngest patron at their restaurant by about 45 years. At least you know you can take grandma here. But don’t... she is still family.< /Review>< Pics>

We had brunch here and I was very impressed. This is a Jewish deli serving excellent food with very sizable portions. We had 5 star service from a server that's been working there for almost 20 years. I had a sausage and mushroom omelette with Monterrey jack cheese. It was very filling. My order came with potatoes and a muffin. The deli also serves bakery items so if you have a sweet tooth this place is worth checking out. Everyone in our party enjoyed the food. They have a parking lot with free parking. Pay the cashier at the end before leaving. Feel free to leave a like. Cheers!<//text>

Haven't visited in maybe 7 or so years and not because of anything other than there are so many restaurants in San Diego. Pandemic conditions are no fun but DZ Akins seem to have that under control as there were many outdoors dinners. No surprise as the food is really exceptionally good. And even though one of our orders were botched via miscommunication, even that was good. Hands down, 5 🌟<//Text>

This deli never disappoints. From the friendly staff to the large menu you can’t go wrong. They have the best grilled pierogis. I usually get a sandwich and take it home for lunch the next day! They are massive. You definitely will not go hungry!< /text>

<Date>1599793917878< /Date><Text>One of the few Jewish delis in San Diego. Standard fare, lots of options. You can sit down in the restaurant or order from the deli and bakery togo. Great bakery items - I always love to get some cookies to go.

Recommended the half sandwich half soup combo. Generally on the pricier side, but the combo helps. Easy to order togo or delivery.

Does not compare to Canter's or Jerry's - have not been able to find that quality or flavor in San Diego.<//Text>< pics>

Tuesday, August 6 - My husband and I had lunch here today.  I had the BBQ Treat sandwich with onion rings and he had the Philly Cheese Steak sandwich with fruit.  To begin with our waitress was exceptional!  One of the best we've seen and we eat out a lot.  The food was delicious and made perfectly.  The meat on my sandwich was tender and flavorful, and the BBQ sauce was perfectly tangy.  On the way out we stopped at the bakery and purchased dessert for later..carrot cake cupcake and chocolate custard eclair (mine).  YUM!!  Today I rated it 5 stars...but then we came back the following week...

Monday, August 12 - Last week our lunch was so good (as mentioned above) that I wanted to come back for another BBQ Treat sandwich.  Unfortunately, unlike last week, the service today was terrible and the restaurant was only half full.  It took 15 minutes before someone came over to take our drink orders and then another 10 minutes to get the drinks.  My husband ordered the Mish Mash and it was fine.  When my order finally arrived the meat was tough and chewy and basically uneatable.  The BBQ sauce was bland, tasteless, and had no tang whatsoever.  I don't know why there was such a big difference in taste and quality and service from last week but it was a huge disappointment especially since I was looking forward to it all morning.  Even though I couldn't eat it I hate wasting food so I paid for it and took it home to see if my husband could eat it later.  So, unfortunately, I had to rate it only 1 star.< /Text>

<Review>Went for lunch, had the matzo ball soup with mini sandwich, a knish and a black cherry Dr.Brown.
Menu is pretty large and prices are pretty reasonable.
I did notice most people were ordering breakfast items so I’ll try that next time. Overall, was nice.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None</response>< GmapID>

Absolutely the best Jewish delicatessen in San Diego. There are a few others that try to compete but they aren’t even in the same league. The food here will knock your socks off with big portions and quality. Their deli takeout can’t be beat!</text>

<text>We've been going here for 30 years.  Great food and service.  Their "mini-sandwitch" and soup will definitely fill you up. Try number 75, but you can go wrong with anything on their huge menu.< /text><gmap_id>0x80d956f1769222eb:0x8de1ab4c735f7005</gmap_id>< user_id>

The wait was extremely long for the deli sandwich I ordered. The sandwich itself was also pretty disappointing for the price- $18.50. It was comparable to eating styrofoam. 10/10 would not recommend.< /Text>

Very good quality food: only place to get good sliced tongue, brisket, chopped liver, as well as great rye and pumpernickel bread.  Bakery has some real delicious treats.  A bit pricey, but very good.<//text>

It’s a little bland most the time, I think to cater to the older crowd. But I’m never super impressed. The service is good. But it’s typically always busy, so the servers are running around a lot. I do dislike that the drink cups are tiny, which is another reason that the servers are busy running around refilling drinks.
one thing that I do enjoy here is their bakery. The cookies are delicious.< /Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOpdZLkCAwwLgNHYP31llX4tieAcFVd6Zrlx-J4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPGKzkxWAkTg0ph9R19ZAglb5UbaZiV0E7TGN-E=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOF7Dxqv-ZSWw_7myVSx_jC9tV2-_Qpx4dx33TO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures><Response>None</Response>< GmapID>

Ate here for first time and the food was good. The matza balls are a little bland but the soup broth made up for it a bit. The meat and potatoes and gravy were bomb though! Very moist and flavorful meat, smooth potatoes and delicious draft that brought it all together. The desserts looked very delicious as well but I didn't have room to try any. 😄</text>

<Text>Good food, good service.
Filthy carpet. What really put me  off as I was finishing my meal I heard the waitress calling another employees attention to 'some kind of feces on the floor '
The guy cleaned it up and took a floor mat from the kitchen and   placed it over the mishap. The place appears to have really gone down hill over the years I'm sure that the situation emperor Newsom is perpetuating is not helping.
After looking around, I feel fortunate that neither my self nor my guests have taken ill.< /Text>< Response>

<text>So much food both my husband and I took half of our sandwiches home with us. Onion rings were really good. They have a jar of pickles on the table that were crisp and crunchy.  🍽
My sister-in-law ordered the cabbage and corn beef with steamed veggies and it was a huge helping!
We also purchased items from the bakery which were awesome!< /text><gmap_id>0x80d956f1769222eb:0x8de1ab4c735f7005< /gmap_id>< rating>

I had their delicious Ruben! The pastrami was cooked and seasoned well and the bread was fantastic. Even though it was 17 dollars cause it was a Wednesday . If it was Tuesday or Thursday , it would have been 13. Great food. You get what you pay for. Not the best place if you're trying to dine on a budget but it's absolutely a great atomosphere and a great menu. I will be returning soon.</review>

<Text>My husband and I love to go to DZ Atkins after Friday Night Services with our friends. We have been regulars since we moved to San Diego in 2017. It has a great atmosphere, great service, and great food! My favorite dish is the Thai Steak Salad. The portion is HUGE, and you have enough to take home and make two or three meals out of it. We are looking forward to going back there when this pandemic is over.</Text><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><Date>1595707108580<//Date>< Gmap_id>

Friendly staff, generous portions and more choices than you can shake a stick at.  The deli counter and bakery are a nice treat.  Cute gift shop.  Parking can be difficult during peak times.  You pay for your meal at the register and sometimes it backs up because they also ring up the deli and bakery.  Be prepared for leftovers.  Only dish I didn't really care for was the chicken soup...I found it too salty but others adore it.  I'm in love with their Reuben sandwich.  Old school
ambiance with local celebrity photos
gracing the walls, comfy booths and pickle crocks topping each table.<//Text>

Yay, ice cream at DZ Akins is the best. Glad they are back open. Mid-week was quiet for dinner. I called ahead and did not need reservations.</Text>

<Text>It's great, in a not great way. I use to work at a diner when I was younger and there will always be a place for it in my world, even though I'm now a professional chef and I love well seasoned flavorful food. Sometimes it's great to have some chopped liver or an egg salad sandwich. I dont know, you figure out if you like it or not.<//Text><Resp>None<//Resp>< name>

<Review>Popular place and you can tell if you sit and get service. Take out is on our and the family order Reubens and the pastrami was so tender and mouth watering. I could only finish half the combo and it was just as good the next day! Price matches the great tasting food. I cannot wait to go back<//Review>< name>

I loved the corn beef and cabbage! Huge delicious food the fried chicken is tasty and the meat is tender. My boyfriend had the fried chicken patty and finished it up there. We will go again for my moms birthday in 2 days. Hope they have the clam chowder. Yummy! 😋< /Text>

Place is amazing, all these years of coming and going to dz Akins and I never get sick of the scrumptious food in the window and in my tummy. It's a bit expensive but well worth every penny.
I got 2 wedding cookies, a benuelo for my husband and a ring ding for after dinner tonight. The East coast has come home! Thank you for keeping up the standards you had when you first opened!<//review>

Quintessential diner experience!  Seasoned wait staff and large, open booth seating area gives this place a lot of old-school charm.  Huge menu with daily specials and all day breakfast really ensures something for everyone.  The prices are about what you'd expect from a non-chain diner, but the portions are not disappointing and the quality is outstanding.  On the weekend, get seated before 9am to beat the rush.</Review>

I had a sandwich from the deli and the tuna was very bland and the bread was hard. This is my second time trying them out and both experiences were the same. The food is ok and overpriced.  However their assortment of cookies and desserts are delicious.</Review>

< Review>
Amazing food 👌. I ordered the French toast and it was some of the best French toast that I've ever had! The bread was so perfectly soft, and sweet. My partner ordered the matsa ball soup, and also thuroghly enjoyed it. The environment was comfortable and cozy. My only real cons are that the place can get a bit busy. 100% would recommend.< /Review>

I give this place 2 start because the service was great lady was very nice. But the food was the worst I ever had I think for American standard it was good but for Canadian standard this place would shut down after 1 week of opening. No flavor overly big menu how do they keep things fresh with a menu like that.  The priced you can get way better food in Canada for the price that I paid.</review>

Service was excellent.  I had the turkey sandwich with bacon and potato salad. I didn't like the choice of iceberg letus on the sandwich and the bun was pretty dry.  Just didn't have much flavor.   The turkey was very tender. This was my first time at D.Z Akins.< /text>

I love this place.  The food is always quality with large portions.  Can't go wrong with anything you order.  Check out the bakery and gift shop on your way out.  I attached a photo of half of a sandwich.  Yummy!</review>

Even with all the new rules due to Covid19 they were very quick and very friendly. For a first time patron I was very impressed with the flavors and the homemade pickles! I recommend you try the fried pickle spears!< /text>

<Text>I've been going to DZ Akins since I moved to San Diego in 1975, a year after they opened.  It has consistently been one of my two favorite restaurants and not without cause.  I went last Friday for their Fish 'N Chips special and it's beyond yummy.  Three large pieces of perfect fish, pure white, excellent firm texture, and mild.  I also had a bowl of their wonderful Manhattan chowder which is creamy and delicious.  The bomb.  DZ has never disappointed in 45 years.<//Text><Date>1579122104389<//Date>< gmap_id>

They are open with out door seating and for take out. The menu is massive with everything you can think of. We shared a matzo ball soup which is delish! I had a cornedbeef on rye, my hubs had a chopped liver and my son had chicken and waffles! Everything was soo good. It is a little pricey but worth it IMHO. It's a lot of food and we usually take half home!< /text>

<rating>3<//rating><review>Traditional Jewish restaurant with a menu of deli style sandwiches.  The combo soup with mini sandwich with choice of meat.   The mini is half the amount of meat in the sandwich.   The dinner plates is a pile of meat with choice of potatoes and veggies and a side of soup or salad.  The food here is decent.   Comparing to Katz's of NYC, the meat here isn't as tasty.   The service here is really good and everyone is super friendly.   Don't forget to stop at their dessert counter for a treat.</review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN0pXcReewUzL40VITdGRQTHTpWYgzg4SFfrCBg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMFFi9l3SZI53jkgfAPon3BosvnI0ZHR3leh_Qg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPWM1wK2NJvoxSViQ662EkNk0a-PxetQHPrskGe=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics>< Response>

<Text>The premier deli in San Diego. Everything is good here. If you’re in the area, stop by. Good luck finding a choice on menu; there are so many items!

My mom has been coming here since before I was born (I'm 25 now)! I basically grew up coming here for special occasions, birthdays, graduations, etc. The portions are big and the food is amazing! And don't forget the pickles on the table! Definitely make sure to stop at the cookie counter on your way out :)<//Review>

I've been to this place many times and I always enjoy bring there. The restaurant and parking can get full at meal times so do plan accordingly. Even if you need to wait, there's a small gift shop there for you to shop. The food is good for most of them. According to my husband, he says the pastrami didn't have the taste. There's also a bakery that sells all kinds of baked goods like homemade ding dong. Although my husband again complaints there isn't any chocolate taste, you must try to be the judge. So be adventurous! Try everything!</text>

We try to go each time we are in the area. My favorite are the hot Reuben sandwiches, they are fantastic! Today I ordered a Brisket Ortega chile sandwich with a side if au jus. A great choice! I had to take half the meat off just to eat it, which means leftovers!! We had a party 9f 4 and everyone was pleased with their meal choices.<//Review>

<text>I live a hour north of this restaurant and everytime I visit family (which is often) in San Diego I make sure to stop by, even with the pandemic when everything was closed, we would phone in our order and I will drive by to pick it up. Love, love, love their rare roast beef sandwich on challah (they have both sliced and bun to choose from). My daughter always has their soup and 1/2 a sandwich (6oz of meat so not really 1/2 a sandwich, more like 3/4 sandwich lol). She loves the kreplach soup which is served in a very large, what I would call a pasta bowl. It has chicken broth, noodles and carrots in it. It is a good meal all by itself.  They have a full bakery where I make sure to stop by and get some rugelach cookies for my trip home. They offer tons of ice cream shakes, cakes, pies, cookies, bread, bagels,  rolls and so much more. Before walking out the door, we always stroll through the quaint gift shop located in the restaurant.  I have bought, believe it or not, several silver (real, not plated or whatever) rings for my daughter. They have tons of gifts to chose from though. If you are in the area and would like a true deli style meal, make sure to stop by and try this place out.< /text>< Rate>

Food is superb here! This time we tried the Meatloaf and the Ruben sandwich and it's just delicious, you can't go wrong with any selection here. And as we were leaving we met Shotgun Tom (famous radio celebrity here in San Diego) and chatted for a while, he and his wife are regulars here along with hundreds of other celebrities that visit this hem of a place.< /text>

My husband and I came for an early dinner the other day and were pleasantly surprised by the wonderful alfresco dining! We loved it, it almost seem like it had always been that way and maybe should have!Of course the service is always the best but the main attraction ,the FOOD was better than ever, I had a good old-fashioned brisket with bowties and kasha. It was so delicious that it just brought back memories of home! My husband had the chicken salad and coleslaw platter that was so abundant it was enough for a family. So great that it’s so delish every time we go!<//review>

Authentic Jewish deli products are their speciality.  Whether you are Jewish or not, this restaurant offers a menu that caters to all.

It has a FRIENDLY atmosphere that is conducive to good times. It is a wonderful place to visit, and we go there OFTEN.

So go by and enjoy the atmosphere,  and  take home some wonderful pastry from the showcase as you leave. GREAT PLACE TO VISIT .....</Text>

Stopped in after a double hike this morning. Shirley had a hankering to eat here this morning. Nice location, quick seating, and great chow. I chose a bacon egg sammich, side fruit cup and a cup of Joe. The roll for the sammich was an egg bread roll I think. Not particularly fond of it with my bacon egg, nothing wrong with it, just old dog, set in my ways, I will come again, just get toasted English muffin, or bagel with my breakfast. Shirley had a pastrami and brisket sammich. Holy moly was it huge! I did not think she could eat it all, clearly learning new things about my Carnivorous gf. Fruit cup was okay.
I will clearly come here again to eat, and try something different.
Come on down folks for great chow at DZ Akins! Parking can be difficult, come early.< /Text>

<review>They are always super super friendly, helpful and attentive. It feels like a family restaurant in that it is very welcoming.... and always busy.

Yummy Yummy! I haven't found a dish I don't like here. My last visit was with my family. My brother ordered everything but the kitchen sink dessert for his meal. I had a pastrami. There was a Cobb salad or two and a reuben.

My brother asked for picked from the vack as they are cold which makes them extra crispy.

Paying at the front is convenient as it also gives me time to buy some goodies to take home. The pastries are tasty and huge. You can easily share them with others.
The gift store us also very convenient for me.</review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMrD3tC-qO4UKR3k5Bv0a5o4TF8B45cj1HB4X4J=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNuV_HHtIC8GEtIPMoTsW28-VNaOAdvIgIgzzyA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics>< Response>

I love this place. They have the best sandwiches, and they're massive. 100% worth it. They also have an amazing deli and bakery for to go items that's worth a visit. Parking is almost always tough, but worth it. I recommend coming after 1pm for a late lunch to avoid the bulk of the lunch rush.</review>

<Text>As always, great food! The best Reuben in town as far as I am concerned. And the desert counter, oh my! Everything I have had has been outstanding. And if you have a cold or feeling the flu, use food delivery to bring you their chicken and matzah soup! It truly earns the boastful moniker of Jewish Penicillin! It is so good on a roughed up belly and tastes amazing!<//Text>< Response>

I love this restaurant. Everyone treats you like family. The food is so delicious and big portions. The kosher pickles on the table are addicting. They have a beautiful bakery and a lovely gift store. I highly recommend DZ Akins!<//Text>

This place has no downside. Every aspect of DZ Akins is top of the line. The sandwichs are almost to big to eat. Piles of corned beef and pastrami, heaped onto a slice of rye or sourdough. You could bring half this sandwich home and make two regular size sandwiches out of it. The servers are fast and friendly, and have your meal on the table in minutes. While you wait, there is a crock of pickles on the table with tongs to help yourselves. Your choice of mustard is also on the table. Lots of napkins are provided. No better sandwich could be made. And when you are through eating, pay the cashier and hit the pastry and cookie counter in the entrance. Every kind of cookie, cake, pastry, large cake, tort, ethnic pastry and bread. The also sell fresh made bagels. They also have a meat counter with small to large buys  for parties. They also have a great gift shop with items of quality that you won't find anywhere else. This is not your ordinary restaurant,  this place is a celebration of food and the best of everything that is food. If I died in this place, it would take the undertaker a week to get the smile off my face. Love Love Love DZ Akins.</Text>

<text>Best Jewish deli by far and away in San Diego. It matches close to canters in LA but has much better parking. You’ll love everything on the menu and the employees are fast and efficient. I have been going here since their location was just one small end of the now complete shopping center they occupy. Don’t miss this place if you crave real time New York deli style food!</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><Gmap_id>0x80d956f1769222eb:0x8de1ab4c735f7005</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Delicious food and pastries. But an unreasonably long wait to be served, despite a numbering system at the bakery/deli.< /review>

<Review>As much as I live DZ Akins, my meal was terrible! My eggs were overdone, bacon was cold, toast was cold, and potatoes were old and hard. I've been eating there for YEARS and always love it. That had just reopened for sit down dining after being closed due to Covid-19, so perhaps that had something to do with it. I was sadly disappointed!
P.S. Their food isn't exactly cheap for diner food. Makes me sad!</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

The Ruben sandwich was great. The size mind blowing and the meat was well prepared. The fries again another nice size order. The fries came with a dipping sauce that made a good change from catsup. Go enjoy< /Text>

< Review>
It was horrible I had a number 62 pastrami on rye with kraut mozzarella an onion ring. The rye bread with so over toasted you could have made diamonds with it to glass. Then in an attempt to soften the over toasted bread or charcoal they drowned it in butter so much to the point that it was Dripping. The butter then overwhelmed of course the flavor of the rye bread the sauerkraut monsterella cheese and the poor cut and skimpy portions pastrami, I ordered onion rings I got six rings that were equally drenched in oil to the fact that you could have run them out and floated a candle wick in the oil. I ordered a soda which was a 24 oz soda is what I received no choice given on the side that cost $3.50 all in all out the door it cost me over $22 for a vat  of grease and a pot of charcoal.

So the truly sad thing about it is. I have eaten there before and was happy, not ecstatic but happy, I probably at that point in time. I would have given them a 3.5 maybe a 4 rating. This time the only reason I'm giving them a one is that the lowest score that Google has available if they had a -5 I would give it to them.</Review>

I love DZ Aikens not only do they have wonderful food you can eat in, or take out.  Their bakery is my favorite all fresh cookies,cakes,cheesecakes, and fresh bread. You can spend time in this place their gift shop has very unique gifts and their deli is just as good. They have the best kosher pickles on the tables when you dine in.</Text>

<text>I got a grilled corned beef Ruben sandwich here.  It's my favorite sandwich and it was on sale this month for $13 with fries, potato salad, or other sides.  The Ruben also offered a vegetarian patty, pastrami or smoked turkey.  The smoked turkey goes great with the hot mustard they have available, but the standard dressing is amazing.  They have a deli and a bakery inside.  I recommend this family friendly fairly priced high quality restaurant/delicatessen/bakery.< /text><Gmap_id>0x80d956f1769222eb:0x8de1ab4c735f7005</Gmap_id>< user>

It’s the closest thing San Diego has to an East Coast Jewish deli. DZ Akins has been a San Diego institution for as long as I can remember, and I’ve been a San Diegan for over fifty years. In addition to being “authentic” by West Coast standards it can boast that its rye bread is every bit as good as anything New York has to offer. And that’s the real test, isn’t it?<//review>

DZ Akins is still a good restaurant but nothing like it was 30+ years ago. The food is still pretty good but the prices are astronomical for the overall quality. The service has always and continues to be great. There is one thing that has not changed in 30+ years. They never bring extra napkins to the table or offer them to the patrons.< /review>

It's good. Not the best. For what it is I get it but I wouldn't consider it amazing in general. And definitely not the best between here and New York (which is what I hear often).< /review>

Waitress was a sweetheart but clearly flustered and overworked. She did her best to take care of us but I can't stand when I'm at an establishment and it isn't adequately staffed. On the plus side food was good. Do NOt get the kids Mac n cheese though unless you like overcooked "not Kraft" boxed product lol. My daughter didn't touch it but the waitress kindly removed it from the bill. Lots of treats to choose from  and HUGE portions and we enjoyed our classic diner favorites here. Ice cream could probably be better quality tho... It was a bit runny and melting all over the place by the time it reached our table and didn't have that nice  homemade flavor I like (I'm  not sure of it was or not).  Either way it at least tasted pretty good but I'll aim to come here when it's way less busy and it'll probably be a better experience.<//Text>

Food and service good. Food is very expensive but you get quite a bit. They ought to consider a full menu for seniors or lite eaters.< /Review>

Went in and there were a lot of people. Was expecting slow service but we were seated quickly and our server was prompt.  The sandwich I got was delicious and came with a lot more meat than expecting. Also got a cafe moca and tasted like it came from a coffee house and was very pleased with it. Server was very friendly as all staff I felt with. I left my son's sippy cup and luckily a young lady found it and brought back to me before I left. Real nice dining experience all the way around. Will be coming back.</Text>

<Review>Didn't go for the sit down side of the restaurant this morning. We went on the deli. We got some super fresh bagels/bialys and a few other baked items. Since we got there just after they opened, everything was Jennifer coming out of the oven. And, of course, we had to get some chopped liver and pickles to bring home. 🤗< /Review>< rating>

This is as authentic as you can get for an authentic menu to order from. The portions  are plenty. Most meals you can bet you will take leftovers home. Most everyone was walking out with a leftover box in their hand.
Best to go the days you see your favorite item to order to save a few bucks.<//Review>< Pics>

<Rate>1</Rate><text>I heard of this restaurant  WAS GOOD,, about a year ago I’ve never eaten there because I live in a different city and my father’s 90th birthday is coming up and him and his wife Evelyn , have  been stuck in their house since February .. due  you COVID.,  and I wantEd to order some Jewish delicacies that he would love and he deserves.. I didn’t mind paying for DoorDash and I didn’t mind paying for delivery service or anything and  they were so adamant about not wanting to help me I am so shocked because restaurants have been shut down well business is but restaurants are getting a big hit I feel bad for the waitresses and the owners and such so I was willing to pay whatever it took to have good food delivered and a price I didn’t care the price well I care the price but ., it’s a birthday and I was wanting to make this happen .. and they said the only thing that they would help me with is catering , like as if I was catering a wedding or something and I could not order off the main menu and they would not deliver and they would only let me use DoorDash .. I said that’s fine how ever  you do it ,  & can I order?  and then the manager got on and said well you can’t order of the main menu you can only order off the catering menu which means you have to order of the catering menu I wanted to order off the main menu because it’s for two people I was willing to pay whatever same price as a catering menu.. So what does tells me as they still have all the same food from perhaps January and they can’t cook food to order so just to let you know the food that there’s selling you.. has been frozen since the pandemic started and you’re getting old food because boy if I had a restaurant and I’ve been closed down for three months and somebody’s ordering $200 worth of food for two people I will be up on top of it and make it the best meal they ever had!! But they do not have the ability to cook the food that I ordered of the main menu and have it show up on the Fourth of July they had five days to even go shop for fresh food and they still wouldn’t do it I would not go to this restaurant ever..  hopefully they’ll see the three of you take the moldy stuff out of the freezer and consider doing a little bit better customer service I talk to not only the girl at the front desk but the managers hill good luck hope your rest of doesn’t shut down due to sick food.. oh and by the way Miltons in San Diego is willing to bring fresh food on the day that I suggested go there they have a fabulous food fabulous customer service and I was able to order two  of a lot of things off the menu and have it delivered.. And they have a wonderful telephone skills go to Milton’s< /text>< pics>

Our server was absolutely fantastic, friendly, efficient  and helpful.
The roast beef is the real deal, an absolutely delicious chunk of beef.
It was truly as good as it looks.< /text>< Pics>

Great food! Free pickles at your table are super yummy. I got one of the super combo sandwiches. They stack them HIGH with lots of meat. Always delicious, always great service!< /review>

My wife ordered a tuna sandwich which tasted like an egg salad sandwich.  She was disappointed.< /Review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

<Text>A Great Deli. We are real fans of DZ Akins. Have been going there for about 5 years. This is an old fashioned Deli with photos of local and national celebrities hung on the walls.  (Our young adult children don't like going there because of the often older clientele! Their loss!) This is the type of Deli that serves great sandwiches and dinners. They have a wonderful bakery that has the best rugula.  They have a sandwich of the day that is plenty big enough to make 2 meals. They also have a good choice of soups... Real homemade soup. The sweet and sour cabbage soup is our favorite. Most of the very long last of sandwiches they offer are really good. Try their Ruben! And you can get that with a "seedless rye bread", thank you. The only thing I can't recommend is the Filly Cheesesteak. I just had it today. The long roll it was on was nicely toasted, but had SO many sesame seeds that it almost overwhelmed the sandwich. Then the meat (nice thin slices) was way over cooked and dry. They're didn't seem to be any seasonings on the meat to make it a more interesting taste. So don't get the Wednesday special!   But everything else we have had there is definitely recommended.<//Text>< gmap_id>

<review>Iam giving this 2 because the sandwiches were not bad , we had Reuben Bastrami and smoked Turkey , Bastrami was alright , we liked smoked turkey better.
Pickles were soggy, side dishes were Coleslaw and potato salad , coleslaw really tasted weird , potato salad was fine.

Customer service was good and our waitress was nice.

The reason why I am giving only 2 is because of their bakery , we paid more than 12 dollars for  two Napoleons , it was the worst thing I had in my life , it had a terrible icing on top and puff pastey was not crunchy at all , it tasted horrible, we threw them away , only reason I can think of is that their not fresh, if you do not have fresh bakery then THROW IT AWAY , DO NOT SERVE IT TO YOUR CUSTOMERS.</review>< time>

Always a Grrrr-8 meal (x2). More than you can usually eat a 1 sitting.
It's my usual (Where would you like to eat Sister?)
I'm often asked, the Restaurant itself, is NOT a Kosher Kitchen. Although most all your favorite traditional dishes will be on the menu.
The WILL Cater Kosher events at your Synagogues Kitchen.<//review>

Love this place! As soon as you enter you have an explosion of sensations.  A little store at your right with cute little gift ideas, a bakery to your left (yes indulge they are delicious) a deli to your left and finally the restaurant. Food is wonderful. Everything I have ordered I have loved. Returning many more times.<//Text>

<review>Kosher restaurant in East County with a diverse menu. Parking is tight and this place gets crowded after 9am. There's a kosher deli in the front in case you're taking to go. Everyone is friendly and they accommodate special dietary requests. While you're waiting to be seated checkout the photos of celebrities who've eaten there. I ordered the breakfast special on the display board. My hubby created his own omelette.<//review><username>Carolyn Vernon< /username><pics>None<//pics><user>115477832178527616861< /user><Rate>5<//Rate></record>

<Review>I'm from the East coast where Jewish delis are very plentiful, so I may be a bit biased here. I enjoyed my experience but I found the food to only be average. My sandwich bread was actually kind of small, which required the meat to be stacked much higher than necessary. Deli's back east stack meat high, but on large portions of bread!  The turkey was dry, the corned beef only fine and overall the sandwich was lacking flavor.  Could have used a creamier coleslaw or more Russian dressing to really help it out.

Onions rings were perfect and the service and staff were really great!  Everyone was super friendly and they had plenty of people working to help out.

I will definitely go back because it fills a deli void in my stomach, but it's more like a pale echo of a good deli back east.< /Review>< GmapID>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Review>This is the best New York Style Jewish Deli Restaurant. I got the Four egg fresh mushroom, jack and avocado omelette with home fries and fresh rye toast. Our service was great. The servings are so generous that I always bring half home for a second meal later. Their deli and bakery are top notch also!  Just FYI, the corn beef on rye is about eight inches high and a massive tasty sandwich too. You definitely ought to try it.< /Review><response>None</response><user>109633668959505640657</user><Pictures>None< /Pictures><time>1550542174850<//time><user_name>Yep 3<//user_name></record>

We were craving some big deli style sandwiches and this place just really hit all the marks. It was cozy, the people and employees were very friendly and the food was classic. My wife tried the sauerkraut and got a Rueben for the first time. We're both very happy with the pastrami but the corned beef was kind of fatty. Would stick to the pastrami only next time. This place is great though and will definitely come back. Coleslaw was good and greener than I've seen anywhere else. The onion rings were great, onion didn't fall out. The fries were perfectly cooked steak fries. I had the pastrami Rueben with coffee and water, wife had corned beef Rueben with Dr pepper. Huge menu and plenty of choices for future visits.<//Review><pics>None</pics><Response>None<//Response>< gmapID>

Delicious sandwiches, and gigantic portions. Had the rare roast beef and homemade potato salad. Roast beef was nice and tender and seasoned just right. Went between lunch and dinner so parking was not a problem and had no wait. Is a little expensive but was worth it.</review>

Blintz are tasteless and overpriced. Not sure if that’s the way they’re supposed to taste just not to my liking. Service was great but food and price not equal to what it is.</Review>

Best soups, especially the matzoh ball. Busy happy atmosphere.  Their own baked rye bread is fresh and delicious. Mid to high prices,  but worth it and portions are generous.< /text>

This a restaurant, deli and bakery, and all of them great. The menu has many choices. I had the Bernie's delicatessen house salad and it was huge with a great portion of corned beef and cheeses. The matzah ball soup is good too. The staff is friendly and helpful. No wonder they've been around for decades.< /Text>

Deli is always good, shame it's the only "kosher" one not too far away. Bit expensive however still worth it, it's no Canters. But for San Diego it will have to do. Need more delis like this in town.</text>

The Very Best Food and The Very Best Service. The entire Restaurant was clean and the amount of food was so much it was falling off the plate. The Corn Beef and Cabbage was so Delicious, I could not stop eating. But I must tell you the Sweet and Sour Cabbage Soup was out of this world. My husband is still talking about it.
If you have never eaten then, I recommend you get to DZ AKINS ...... OY VEY!!!!!!< /Text>

<review>DZ Akins does offer good food I don't go there to eat the food very often. But their Deli and bakery is phenomenal. I love their eclairs and I truly enjoy learn Napoleon and Josephine's their cookies their bread is really great. It is good eating but I should not be eating it with my waistline and my diabetes. While I allow myself a treat once in a while. And DZ Akins is a real treat.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

Ive always enjoyed eatting here. When working in the area I've always made a special effort to have lunch here. Their sandwich menu has slightly changed. My corned beef & pastrami was dry & somewhat  disappointing. I really don't feel that this was their best product considering they are one of the oldest if not oldest deli in San Diego. 😣</review>

What can I say?   Many of the people who visit us ask to eat here again and again.  It’s good Jewish food with the usual attached meat and bakery.  It ain’t kosher so live with it.  Many special events meals too

I almost always get the lox.  Chicken soup can be had in all its forms.  The salads have been complimented.   The sandwiches from corned beef to complicated are good too.

Parking can be an issue and during heavy meal times the wait can be a while.

Tip these people hustle!<//text>

My family and I have been going to this restaurant for years and we are never disappointed! Today we were served by April and she was SO sweet, knowledgeable, and attentive. She gave us some great recommendations for lunch and she packed up our leftovers like a pro!! The portions are big so sharing is a good idea and the menu is huge so look it up online first if it’s your first visit.</review>

I've been going here since I moved to San Diego. My favorite is the Ruben on Sourdough bread. The onion rings are the best in San Diego. The waitresses are so good and they go out of their way to give the best possible service. I give them a 10+. Oh, and try out the desserts to go because there's no more room in the tummy to eat after one of their delicious meals.< /review>

When i visited it was my 1st time and i can't wait to go back i had the best Rueben sandwich and mac salad the iced tea stays strong even with a full glass Of ice i don't know how  they do it. Not only was the food outstanding your table is set with a HUGE tub of homemade thick pickle slices and the variety of mustards of your choice the diner extends into a deli..sandwiches and soups to go and cuts of meats of your liking and fresh bread (sliced if you like) many cookies and pastries sugar free aswell boxes are sold by the pound cute small cookies for tea time or when company drops by also a great gift shop yea it's a little crowded but hey everyone's friendly and in that atmosphere you middle a friend before you leave.<//Review>

Serving sizes are huge, good service and all that. First thing I looked at when I opened the menu was corn beef on rye with Swiss cheese. Great Jewish food, but I was surprised to see something so not kosher. So if you're looking for great Jewish good this is the place, but if you want kosher food this is not a place to go.< /Text>

The baked goods and breads use to be better.  They aren't as good as they were like they cheapened up on them but prices are higher.  The rye and pumpernickel bread use to be awesome now it's average.< /text>

Great sandwiches!!! Had #62 pastrami on toasted sourdough with pasta salad. Don't get down that way very often so the rest of the menu has gone largely unexplored.<//Review>

<review>First time here and the food was good.  Pretty big place and it was packed but service was still quick.  They have a bakery as well and friends have said the deserts are really good.

Good food.  Very pricey.  Restaurant was lit with fluorescent lighting (not very dining friendly).  Way too many items on the menu!  Servers were very pleasant. Bakery & gift shop all in same building.  Limited parking.< /review>

It is the best Jewish deli in San Diego. Good corned beef and good soups. It has a big selection of sandwiches. Pickles at the table. Always crowded but usually good service.< /text>

<Time>1558937270177< /Time><Rating>4< /Rating><Text>I visit mostly for the deli and bakery items. Service is quick and the food is yummy.

I also, on occasion eat at the restaurant which has an extensive menu that includes kids meals.  The servers are always in good humor, the portions are large and service is also quick.  Each table has its own pickle jar to nosh on while you wait. I recommend checking out the daily specials; you might find something you like.

My only real complaint is that parking in the lot can be difficult when they're busy. But, there is plenty of street parking when that happens.</Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

Only kosher meat place in San Diego as far as I know. Food is very good and staff is very friendly. It's nothing fancy but it gets the job done. I've had the shawarma, burger, and hot dog. All were good. Hotdog was a little small but I'm just nitpicking. Definitely will eat there again soon< /review>

The elder server was a sweetheart when she was around. But with the Hospital cafeteria bland food I’m  Not impressed. It’s an old timers place. Outdated atmosphere. Huge menu takes 15 mins to overlook , Kids menu is over priced, charging $10 for out of the box kraft Mac & cheese is unacceptable. After We decided to get something from the bakery...waited 8 mins and no help while 4 employees standing around we just left.  Sorry, but your not sorry.<//Text><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None</Response><GmapID>0x80d956f1769222eb:0x8de1ab4c735f7005</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Review>The food is delicious and the portions are hefty. The food is Kosher-style, but not Kosher. They do serve pork and do not adhere to other Kosher practices. It's a bit on the pricey side, but there are menu items that are more comfortable for those operating on a budget. The bakery is INCREDIBLE with all kinds of fresh, delectable treats. I definitely recommend DZ Akin's.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< rate>

The atmosphere is casual and the food is really good. You have to get something from the bakery before you leave, it is all so fresh!

It's been ages since I've visited DZ Akins.  The food is great and the portions large.  I had the brisket dip with potato salad.  And the pickle jar is always a hit.  At $16.95 it was a steep price.  Of course you can't leave there without hitting the dessert counter.  A carrot cake cupcake, chocolate on chocolate cupcake, cherry turnover, and blueberry scone set me back $18.50.  Prices rather high so it'll have to be a special occasion before I'll be back.< /review>

They always have great portions, enough to share. I ordered the Chile Ortega and cheese omelette, was ok but the omelette had too much sauce on top. It would of been better if it didn't have it. They give you the choice of a bagel or toast. It's a bit pricey but well worth the money you pay.< /Text>

Omg this is heaven! My only issue is that the portions are way out of whack. That's just too much food! I boxed pigsty much my whole sandwich to go after the I shared the mini ethnic sampler with my friend. By the way I recommend that platter for sure,  mostly vegetarian except for the beef perogi.  It's somewhere that I will visit again for sure. They have deli meat cote sale along with bread and pastries. Lovely service as well.<//Review>

<Review>Homey, cozy, what i can assume to be traditional style old fashioned jewish cuisine. The wide variety of pastrami sandwich selections, self serve from the pot kosher pickles, body warming and filling matzo ball soup, daily specials. You need to come back and come back often to be able to try everything on this gigantic menu. After your meal polish it off with either a traditional Jewish dessert or what i like to do, get a selection of kosher pastries from their bakery our front. Come with your boo like i did and steal half of their menu item too. Lol. Prices are a bit high which is why i give 4/5. I cant come often. But boyyyy do they stuff ur sandwhich with meat. Enough to make 2 more sandwhiches. If ur like me u take the free bread n butter n make more sandwhiches. Loll</Review>< gmapID>

Breakfast menu all day. The on site bakery deli, counter and gift shop makes for a very rounded full filling experience.

Our server was the most helpful waiter I have ever had in any restaurant. He allowed me to try a few items I was not familiar with before deciding what to order.  Do not remember this name but he was very tall and latino. Kept our water glasses filled and remove the dirty plates promptly he even picked up my jacket I had not noticed had fallen on the floor.< /review></record>

Food is fair. Generous portions. Service was iffy. Cost is ridiculously high! We don't worry about cost when we go out to eat but, this is a deli. $63, before tip for 2 sandwiches, is not cool.<//Review>

Each meal is like three meals. Good food. The prices are a little high but you get a lot of bang for your buck.< /text>

Fabulous NY style deli hiding out right here in SD. You can sit in the restaurant to nosh or take your favs home but you must give these folks a try. You'll quickly become a regular.< /text>

<Review>Marvelous traditional Jewish deli!

I thought that my eggs benedict were cooked to order and tasted really good, however, the hollandaise sauce was thick consistency which congealed rather quickly. The bigger issue was s/o bagel which was cut unevenly and was really hard. We were seated quickly for how busy it was, and the server was nice!< /review>

<Review>This is the deli in the San Diego area.  Period.  The menu is extensive and the food is consistently delicious.  Portion sizes will make you waddle out or demand a doggy bag.  We come often and are always pleased.  Plus:  fresh pickles at the table!  Additionally, the bakery products are luxurious and fresh.< /Review><gmap_id>0x80d956f1769222eb:0x8de1ab4c735f7005< /gmap_id><time>1511973067120</time>< user_name>

Been going here for years for excellent sandwiches. The fresh pickles are a treat and the desserts are quite good. Usually get pastrami here, but I changed it up and got the Philly cheese steak. So much better than any cheese steak in Philadelphia. No lie!</text>

Too many food items to comment on all, but I have eaten here dozens, if not more than 100 times.  The food has always been good.  It is an old looking deli with not so grandiose decor, but the staff and food are awesome.  And while it is an old fashioned Jewish deli, their bacon is great. :-) They have over 125 meals on the menu.</text>

<text>Great place for Jewish deli experience in a breakfast restaurant...Except for the so-so over-priced coffee. The menu is EXTENSIVE, with many deli style offerings, including latkes and corned beef Reubens. The breakfast special is a bargain, but don't forget to OVER-tip your waiter/waitress, here and elsewhere, as they truly DO work hard for the money. Truth.</text>< pictures>

<text>My wife and i love this place. Everytime we come here we are greeted with a smile, and the wait (if there is one) is never very long. The food is delicious, and the portions are huge. You most likely will have leftovers to take home. Then as your leaving they have a delicatessen with some of the most delicious desserts that I've ever had. I can't help but indulge my sweet tooth everytime we pass by!<//text>< Pics>

Typical Jewish deli, large menu, and a separate deli and bakery counter. A local favorite. Very busy but service is fast. Parking is an issue but not enough to stop us from going there. Good portions in sandwiches. I like the potato salad.< /Review>

This place is amazing.  I've been told by New Yorkers it's just like a new York deli.  The dessert counter is so good it's dangerous.  But the secret is the massive Sundays, kids and adults love them,. But you probably wont be able to finish one alone</Text>

Love the food for the most part service sometimes isn't the best but love the free pickles and the fact if you get iced coffee no extra charge for refills. Parking is no fun here not that's supposed to be fun but it's almost impossible to find a parking space, Price is
$$ just for one person so 4 people could equal at least $100. Also has a bakery and a gift shop.< /text>

New York style deli restaurant with the overstuffed sandwiches (and prices to match). Can be easily missed from the 8, advise using navigation if unfamiliar. Serves breakfast, lunch and dinner. Daily specials. Very full menu with lots of hard to find offerings: chopped liver, tongue, Dr. Brown's, and egg creams for a few. Excellent bakery. Good service. Appetizer portions of the lox and smoked whitefish are quite generous.< /Review>

If you grew up somewhere on the eastern seaboard and miss 'real' deli food, DZ Akin's is your best bet in the greater San Diego area. While there are many that claim to be a deli, there is nowhere else in town that even comes close to fulfilling that promise. This includes the quirky sense of humor, prominent pickle jars on each table, super-extensive menu, and numerous ethnic dishes.  They can get extremely busy, so expect to wait at dinnertime. Make sure to stop in the bakery afterward for dessert..</text>

Best! That's all... it's the best. Food, baked goods, the deli. Even the lattes are amazing. Fast, friendly service. The only thing that sucks is the parking. The food makes up for it. 😊< /Review>

<Text>The perfect place to go to if you are having comfort food cravings. The portions are very generous here, so bring your appetite! If you love sandwiches, you will love this place. Check the board on the way in to see what the special of the day is. They also have daily specials on particular sandwiches and dishes. The Pastrami is very good here. You can also get really good Corned Beef. Another good thing to know is that their breakfast menu is available all day.<//Text>< gmap_id>

<Text>They have a 2 quart container on the table fill of delicious pickles. Who could ask for anything more you say? Anyone who is Jewish can easily answer that with a thousand requests but here you'll find all sorts of wonderful Jewish and American food. The gift shop has lots if wonderful Judaica items and the bakery. Ah, the bakery. They will fill all your naked goods desires and much much more.

Maybe I was expecting too much. I ordered the basic corned beef sandwich on rye. My thought was a long-standing Jewish Delicatessen ought to knock this one out of the park. Well, maybe I just don't know authentic Jewish Delicatessen. Could be. But I do know what happens to a loaf of bread when you leave it open in a hot kitchen. It dries out. Well, I had to peel the entire outside edge of the bread off. Too hard to eat. Then, between these two slices of dried out bread is a pile of very dry corned beef. Good flavor. Very dry. Not very tender. And that's it. Nothing else. That's the $12.95 sandwich. Yikes. Without a doubt the worst sandwich I have ever been served. Pretty good three bean salad came with it though, so it wasn't a total loss. Anyhow, that's just my one experience with one menu item. But I won't be going back to try anything else.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

This place is way past its prime, tables and booths are all old and sticky, the place really grosses me out. Compared to langers deli the pastrami is a 2 while langers is a 9.  I seriously worry about getting sick from.eating here.<//Text>

This is a wonderful place. Everywhere you go in this restaurant you'll see amazing photographs of people who have visited. The food is just like a New York Delicatessen. DZ Akins brings the true flavor of a New York Delicatessen to the table! And of course the same triple-layer large sandwiches are on the menu.<//review>

<review>Love coming to DZ Akins!  It's a great place for families and couples alike.  They have an extensive menu and large portions.  They also have a great deli and Bakery section with all sorts of delicious goodies!  The gift shop also has lots of unique items for sale.  The walls are covered with photos of celebrity patrons which are really fun to look at (and if you're a long time resident of San Diego) nice to reminisce about.

<text>Large quantities of traditional Jewish delicatessen food. Who could ask for anything more? The chicken livers were enormous and the sandwiches were stacked high. They serve breakfast food all day which was popular with some of the pickier eaters in the crowd. The dessert counter looked phenomenal, but we were too stuffed to order any. Next time we'll know to split a dish and save room for dessert!<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< name>

<Text>Traditional Jewish Deli, New York style.
This is an old traditional spot in San Diego, and one of the few places in town where you can get this cuisine.
Some dishes are awesome, others not so much. Overall quality is good.
Joining their email list will allows you to go when they serve specials, which are often great, especially lamb, oxtail soup, and split peas soup.
They excell at making: chopped liver (which they make themselves rather than buy), kishka, onion rolls (also baked there), knish, meatloaf, and in all their pastries.
This is also a good place for a quality but budget breakfast, as they have very affordable deals in the morning.
The most interesting aspect of the restaurant is the place itself, full of memories, painted walls with funny secrets you can discover if you pay attention, and lots of framed jokes.
Service is one of their strengths. They are very friendly and professional and you usually get your meal quickly. Refills come without even asking.
Parking is always easy, they have a huge lot that never fills up.< /Text>< pics>

I love, love, love eating there. I wanted something on the lighter side so I ordered the Mish Mash Soup with a plate of Homemade bread, all different flavors. My partner had the beef brisket with steam vegetables. I've been going to this place since the 1980's! That was last century!  Ouch!<//text>

<Review>Tasty food with an old school deli feel. Parking isn't very good hear since it's a small lot for a lot of businesses. There's also separate deli and bakery options also with a sit down restaurant. I highly recommend giving it a try. Be forewarned the portions are massive!!!!<//Review>< Pics>

<Review>I love this deli. Great atmosphere. Friendly and professional staff. Clean bathroom!

I always tell myself that I'm going to try something new since the menu is huge and there are many, many things I've never tried before, but it's hard for me to deviate from something I know I love. I got my usual pastrami rueben (sans sauerkraut), the BF got a pastrami burger.

The other fantastic thing about this place is that it's an experience, not just a meal. Wonderful deli and bakery. Cute gift shop.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

Be aware that despite Google including the place in it's list of kosher establishments it decidedly does not observe the laws of kashrut.< /Review>

Love this place.  Only true Jewish deli around.   We are regulars and love the food, the service, and the great central location.  If you are a fan of pastrami, lox, bagels, pastry, etc., etc., than you must visit soon.  They have a nice little gift shop too with seasonal and other general gifts and cards.</Text>

My family loves this place! Some of our favorites include pastrami, liver, chicken fried steak, corned beef, and brisket. Their bakery also has the best bagels and homemade cream cheese! After dinner we usually pick up a few cookies from the bakery to take home for dessert as well. Their ice cream sundaes are insanely huge and could feed at least six people! Highly recommended!</Review>

Long time San Diego spot.
My parents love it.
I think it's OK.
I don't understand having pickles on each table and I don't think you're very good. I just don't care for the damn pickles. But normally I'm cool with Pickles but not these ones. Apparently the matzo ball soup is very good.<//review>

Thing I love there the most is the Cobb salad. I feel it's worth the money. I would probably go there more if the food warranted the expensive prices and the obnoxious lighting< /Review>

< Review>
Classic deli sandwiches in a kitschy atmosphere. You'll either love it or just like it. The actual deli counter is the real gold of this place however. The cured fishes, meats, cheeses, and especially the baked goods and pastries are really phenomenal. Take a number and get some of these to go!</Review>

< review>
I LOVE this place. From their hamburgers to their kreplach soup and their MASSIVE salads. (If it's just you eating... get the half salad, trust me) Their food is always great and you're always able to see the owners, they're there all the time. Not something you see at most places.
The waitresses are amazing, how anyone can remember EVERYTHING on those menus is beyond me, and incredibly impressive. The staff in general is great, they get what you need and get you on your way quick. This place gets busy, so it helps if you're a seasoned vet like me with their menu, if not and you don't like a crowd, check out their menu online before you order to-go.
Even if you don't think you'll like this place, try it. It'll soon be on your short list to go every time.< /review>

<Review>I have been waiting to try for the last 7 years but, came back to San Diego to visit last week and decided to get there while I had a chance. The bakery was nice. I had the pastrami and turkey or #3. The pastrami was perfect however the turkey was a little on the dryer than I like side😬. The outside edges of the rye bread we inedible. Just to tough for my liking. The portions sizes are more than enough. You could eat half a sandwich and bring the rest home for another meal. I had the cherry cheesecake for dessert. I was not happy with the size but since I was with family I didn't gripe. I got a 3 1/2 inch long and at the widest end was 1 1/2 inches across.😡 I paid 8 dollars for it. Or $7.95. I would eat there again but, I would be more vocal next time. The prices aren't cheap so....<//Review><user_name>William Castile< /user_name>< pics>

Excellent food but bring your wallet.   The bakery prices require you to refinance your home to be able to pay for a few cookies</Text>

Was in a hurry and bought a take out tuna salad sandwich and potato salad. They were basically tasteless and expensive. I can make a better sandwich and salad! They are way over rated.<//text>

Looking for good NY deli?  This is not it.  Had matzo ball soup and sandwich combo.  The soup was just OK it was rich but i had better ones before.  The sandwich was a total disaster.  It was pastrami half sandwich on two peaces of stale bread with nothing else in it.   The bread was so dry and stale  and other than the pickles they did not provide any mayo or anything until we asked.  Pastrami tasted good but again I ordered a sandwich and as a whole it sucked  since it was hard to eat.  Given the traffic here I would think they would have the freshest bread and al of us got stale bread.    This place is supposed to have some of the best sandwiches but this was really disappointing.   My friends were disappointed as well.  They went to Jewish deli in LA and were raving about it so wanted to come here and check this one out since they live nearby. Total let down.  The service was pretty good considering how busy it was.< /Text>

Moved away from San Diego 10 yrs ago. Came back to visit. DZ AKINS was on my food bucket list. Was surprised the food was just as great as I remember.  The chopped liver is out of this world. The brisket and pastrami was as good as I remember< /Review>

<Review>Great comfort food. Everything made from scratch at the restaurant. Portions are huge. Everything is really good, for dinner my favorite is the chicken cutlets with mashed potatoes. No room for dessert? No problem there's a bakery on the premises filled with yummy desserts again all made right there. Don't forget to check out the gift shop on way out. Gets really busy and parking can be a challenge but worth it.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

This place still makes one of the best sandwiches in all of San Diego and their matzo ball soup is legendary. A little hint, ask for the pickles from the back cooler and you will get some fresh ones instead of the ones that have been sitting on the table for kids can stick their hands in the container. Always love the service here and the Delicatessen and bakery present mouth-watering Temptations that are hard to avoid<//Text>

<Text>It's a real deli and bakery. It's a fixture in San Diego.  Matzo ball soup, big deli sandwich, dill pickle jar on the table. Big breakfast omelettes.  Lots of good food. Just forget about your diet for one day!  Pick up cookies or fresh loves of Bread, or deli meats to take home with you.<//Text><Rating>5</Rating><Response>None< /Response><name>Michael Ben-Yehuda<//name><userid>115899376025736582660< /userid><date>1511196349691</date>< gmap_id>

<review>As close to a New York deli as you'll find in San Diego. Generous servings, genial wait staff. Best on the menu: mishmash soup, stuffed cabbage, meatloaf, lox and eggs.  The mini-sandwich and soup combo is a good deal since they just cut off one corner of the sandwich to make it 'mini'. Takeout from the bakery will make the experience last longer. I like the thumbprint cookies, hamantaschen, and the eclairs.<//review><time>1467178507307</time></record>

<Text>I've been coming here for a few years on and off and the quality is consistent. Many of the servers have been there for years and are friendly. Service is usually very good, when it does get busy it can be just okay.

The menu is pretty large so it can be a hunt if you're not sure what you want. I usually come for breakfast,  getting the breakfast special, which is eggs, bacon/sausage, and pancakes. It's a great deal on a weekday. The food can be somewhat oily or greasy depending on what you get, but it's usually made well and just right. Portions are pretty large.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

Had no warning on any of the baked goods if there were nuts.. boyfriend ordered some and I had a bite and had a severe allergic reaction... lox and bagel appetizer was great and so were the pierogis, just wish I didn’t have to pop 10 Benadryl after.<//Text>

<text>This is a San Diego staple, loved by most, known by all. Deli, gift, and bakery departments. Order a cream cake for a loved ones birthday, you will not be disappointed! In the restaurant, sounds crazy- but I think portions should be shrunk a little bit. The overwhelming plates gross me out a little bit. Food is usually tasty, with a few exceptions here and there. You can tell when they cut corners in the kitchen. The side veggies had that old veggie water taste steamed into them.< /text><time>1516637908843< /time><Pics>None</Pics>< gmap_id>

Saw the reviews and recommendations and decided to visit.   Man o man! The pastrami was phenomenal.  You can order how many ounces you want your sandwich.  6oz, 8oz, or more.
Their pastry delicacies are ssssoooo good.  Most definitely going back, but this time i'm dining in.<//review>

Is this place filled with old people? Yes. Is there somehow always a wait? Yes. Does the parking here increase your risk of a heart attack? Yes, but so does the delicious food.  This is an actual old school diner that I hope never changed.  Its the only place that your grandma will eat and you're secretly fine with it.  No matter what you're craving you can find it on the menu that seems to get bigger every time you're there.  I'd recommend trying everything once but don't want you to get gout. After a late lunch that grandma kept calling dinner, you can go to the bakery/deli area and order a cream puff the size of your head.  Meanwhile your mom buys some smoked brisket and rye bread for sandwhices when you regain consciousness from your food coma.< /Review>

I've been coming to DZ Akin's since I was 8. Restaurant experiences aren't usually memorable, but the family and a loving staff make it so.

I can't stop screaming lox every time I come to this beautiful place. A butchery. A bakery. A restaurant. A lifestyle.

Every time I leave it's been too long.
And every time I'm back, I'm sure to get a homemade ding dong.</Text>

<Rating>2</Rating><review>Arrived today very happy to see they've reopened. Ordered on my way from Carlsbad, for pick up. Unfortunately  the corned beef and pastrami was deitz and Watson? Not even the quality of Boars Head for the money, but definitely NOT the quality of DZ Akins. Not what I expected or thought I was getting! Pressed meat, looked almost like the 2 lbs of pastrami, but NO FAT, VERY THIN AND NO TASTE, same for tasteless corned beef! Bummer. Almond chocolate waffle cookies, also changed. The only good that came out of today, was the potato salad. Wait until they reopen! Don't waste your money or time!<//review>< pictures>

<Review>Little pricier than Denny's, a lot tastier than Denny's. They have a huge selection of stuff to choose from. They are Kosher, if that matters.

I had The making mushroom and spinach Omelette, it was really good. The hash browns chicken fried steak and muffin and wheat toast as well as sourdough toast all look really good that my friends had. With coffee and Extras I would expect to pay $20 per person. With no drink you're more like 15. Plus tip.</Review>< Pics>

If you're looking for satisfying comfort food, DZ Akins will hit the spot. I would suggest coming for their early bird dinner special. It's a really good deal. Otherwise, this place can be pricey. The menu is extensive so it's tough to choose. My faves inc: matzo ball soup, pastrami Reuben, meatloaf, and mushroom chicken. The portions are hearty so you'll probably leave with leftovers. The service is friendly. As an added bonus, all you can eat pickles from the jar on your table. I like to eat mine with spicy sweet mustard.</text>

<Text>If I could add 5 more stars I would.. this place not only has atmosphere for a small little place tucked in to a strip mall off the expressway it's definitely the place to be..or in this case,  eat.. the food is so fresh with huge portions it's well worth every dime they're asking..even though we didn't have to wait to be seated it was extremely busy.. from the dining area to the non stop crowd that waits in line patiently on they're way home to be served by their deli/bakery area off the dining room..the staff was very friendly and the place was very clean.. everyone's food looked delish and honestly all I could think about was how I was going to devour this incredibly huge sandwich that looked to beautiful to eat..but somehow I made it happen to the delight of every taste bud on my tongue..the only disappointment was that I didn't take a picture of what and where I was having lunch.. 110% recommended<//Text><UserId.>116529734605508904362<//UserId.>< time>

My favorite food to get is their chicken soup.  This is the only restaurant that I have ever been to that makes it just like my mother used to.  Their bread is also fantastic!  Their breakfasts are big enough for both my husband and I to share and be completely satisfied.  The service is good and the place is very clean. Their food is the closest to home cooking that I have ever found. Love this place!!!!<//review>

The pastrami was very good this time. The Matzah ball soup could use some noodles.</Text>

It's old school and I love it for this reason. The Reuben sandwich is my favorite here. But pretty much everything I've had here has been tasty and the portions are generous. The desserts, especially the sundaes, I better warn, are way too extravagant and large for just one person to have — they cannot be packed to go either, so order it if you have 3-5 people at the table.</text>

I think this is one of the best delis in town. They have a great selection of both Jewish style cuisines and New York style deli sandwiches. They have great soup when you're feeling under the weather or if you're just a fan of soups< /Text>

<resp>None<//resp><Text>My husband and I went here on September 22nd for our 11th year wedding anniversary. We usually go to another restaurant but we decided to try a new place and so glad that we did. This place is amazing! We went at a good time when it wasn’t too busy and we really enjoyed the food, service, and definitely will return.

My husband and I shared a plate of chicken strips, baked potato, a salad, and steamed veggies. It was perfect because we needed room for dessert. We decided to share a dessert and it was delicious! We couldn’t finish it because it was so big. A good serving of chocolate and coffee ice cream covered in whipped cream, caramel sauce, hot fudge, and cherries.

Oh you better believe we will be back for the food and the dessert. Oh and the coffee? DELICIOUS!!

Sadly we have just gone again and had to take away stars. And here’s why! Service! Only got refilled on water twice, had to ask for the coffee, was ignored quite a bit, and it’s NOT that crowded. Servers just standing around and it doing their job. It’s really sad because we love this place but service has killed it this time for us.< /Text><rating>3</rating></record></dataset><record>

<Name>Jason Bileck</Name><review>Old school deli spot with good food. The prices match the portions you get. Menu is about as large as it gets.You can grab stuff to go from the deli and bakery when you leave. I saw the Eclair on display in the bakery and couldn't believe the size. If you dine in prepare to be surrounded by an older generation. I swear I saw the ghosts of Abe Vigoda and Don Rickles but that might of been the pictures on the wall.<//review><gmapID>0x80d956f1769222eb:0x8de1ab4c735f7005<//gmapID><rate>5</rate>< resp>

My absolute favorite is the matzo ball soup. The crispy dill pickles at the table are a bonus. I always treat myself to a bakery item for dessert. Usually the black and white cookies. They also have a cute gift shop. I so wish they delivered. Portion size is huge for breakfast. Excellent sandwiches as well.</Review>

This place is without peer.  The sandwiches are huge and delicious.  The chicken noodle soup will cure what ails you, and may regrow a limb.  If in San Diego a must try.< /Text>

Surprisingly good Jewish deli/bakery.  Seemingly the only one in San Diego?  The cheesecakes were good, the other pastries looked reasonably tasty and fresh, and the black and white cookie (the bellwether confection of all New York Jewish delis) was pretty good.  I'd be curious to try some of their other foods someday.< /Text>

Waitress kept tripping over the legs of my chair many times, I didnt put that chair there and I didnt choose it.  She should have asked me if she could get me another chair or if my mom could pull her table in, which she could have done.  Also I ordered a whitefish p kn after ac nd thecgish was not deboned.  When I mentioned it to the waitress she told me I was the first one in 20 years to complain and I should have asked for it to be deboned.  What grumpy. Bim sorry I th ipod her 15% , she did not deserve it..  I'm sure she was surprised and embarrassed when she found out j was paying for my parents meals as it was Father's Day.  I do not plan on going back.  Way overpriced, food isnt good anymore and we always feel rushed.  Last time I ordered chopped lu er which was bitter and sour.  The time before that I ordered whitefish salad sabdeich... the was whitefish salad was runny and sour and TV he bread was stale.  This place is going g downhill.  Not worth the wait or the cost.< /Text>

The bakery and deli looked awesome. Desserts looked amazing. However, I may have set my expectations too high because I wasn't very impressed by the meal. Meat in the  Philly cheese steak lacked seasoning and too thick to be in a cheese steak. The reuben with pastrami was good  It's a little pricey but the portions were big. It's worth a try<//review>

<text>Service here is hit or miss, but usually you'll get a good server. The only reason this doesn't get a 5 stars is because sometimes you'll get guilt tripped into tipping, we we were going to tip in cash but the cashier didnt know that so she questioned us if we were going to... never experienced this elsewhere. But on a positive note, the food is very homey and filling. Only once I received orange garnish that was going bad but I'm not sure if you're supposed to eat garnish!<//text>< pics>

I love ordering the breakfast special with a side of french fries.  Sooo good.  Everything I've tasted here is delicious!  My girlfriend and I stop by every chance we get.  I'd say the only downside is that the place is always packed, so it can be difficult finding a parking spot (especially in this parking lot).<//review>

< Review>
The old great memories of a good value sandwich piled high with quality meats. NOT ANYMORE. Prices up, quality down . portions way down. Beer so expensive that I at my sandwich with out a beer for the first time since I was 14.  Too bad such an awesome place has decided to ride on old reputation and let the operation sink into mediocrity!<//Review>

The service was great but the food was not hot. The pancakes were rubbery, the syrup wouldn't come out of the syrup dispenser that they give you. The scrambled eggs were really mashed up in little teeny tiny bits not warm and fluffy. The bacon was also cold. The price was great only $4.99 for the breakfast special, we asked to have the food warmed up in the microwave, and it was much  better warm.  If you wanted to have a cup of coffee it was $3.50, I think that is outrageous. We won't be back for breakfast. We wish we would have gone to Denny's.<//Text>

the sandwich that they showed on their website was not the sandwich I received. The sandwich I saw on the website was piled high just gigantic with pastrami. The pastrami sandwich I got was measly and weak. Although it was a good sandwich and I am going back to try other things. I just felt like it was bait and switch.<//text>

So you like the New York deli experience? You can't do worse than visit this San Diego institution. They've got everything from corned beef and pastrami to matzo ball soup to blintzes to kasha to knishes and so much more.

I currently live in a place where this kind of food isn't available, and whenever I can make it to Southern California, I always try to make sure I get down to this restaurant for my fix. I always get what they refer to as a, Ted, Leitner special: corned beef, pastrami, and Swiss on rye bread with Russian dressing. It's bliss.

Before leaving, don't forget to browse their bakery for some goodies to go.</Text>

I used to live up the street from D.Z. Akin's when I went to college so we would go there a lot.  It's a really fine place to go and get some decent sandwiches and spend time browsing their bakery section.  I loved that they had mexican wedding cake cookies and would always grab a few to bring home with me. This was also our place to grab soup when we were sick.  It was helpful when you were alone during college to have that near by to make you feel better!</text>

Love love this place! Man, San Diego really does have some great restaurants, and this is one of them!

Plenty of breakfast items to choose from, lots of sandwiches and soups that are always delicious and fresh. Don't even get me started on the cookies and cakes and yummy desserts that are right up front in the glass case. Every time I go there I seriously have to leave with a bag of goodies.

Most of the staff has worked there for years, and they are very fast and friendly. It is a little bit on the pricey side, but they do give large portions so you will have food to take home for the most part. Parking can be a little bit tricky if you go during busy times, but it's definitely worth it.<//review>

Great food, large portion sizes, only issue was that service is a bit inattentive but the restaurant is pretty large so that my have had to do with it. Also nice that almost every table is booths. Only say that because it's my preference.<//Text>

We love DZ Akins. They have wonderful sandwiches, soups, main dishes. Our favorites include the beef brisket and their matzo ball soup. The mashed potatoes are out of this world. You will never leave this place hungry.< /Text>

One of the very best places to eat in San Diego. AMAZING sandwiches, especially the Pastrami Reuben with coleslaw on top. Their onion rings are to die for.  Gourmet home-brined pickles on the table. Matzo Ball soup? More like Matzo Bomb soup! Haven't tried anything here we haven't loved. Parking can be a problem so allow extra time. DZ Akins is a must try, a San Diego institution!</text>

The food was OK. The service was not that good (there weren't that many customers, but it seemed like the waitress was avoiding us).  I might return, but it's doubtful....</text>

Hugely successful and authentic NY style deli and restaurant with a sinful bakery... yes, you can get cheese on your sandwich!  LOVE this place. If you want to get a Jewish friend a present for whatever they also run a tasteful gift shop if you are going to a Bar Mitzvah and need a card or token gift look no further- lots of older folks have been eating here for 3-4 decades (like me)< /Review>

A great Jewish deli. Love the free pickles (like a real deli), the Dr. Brown's sodas, and the corned beef sandwich. The Philly cheesesteak isn't what you would get in Philly, but it's a good sandwich nonetheless. The bakery is also fantastic, and it's nice to be able to get matzo ball soup!</text>

<text>I went to visit DZ akin's for the first time after 15 years and it's still pretty much the same. The prices are high but you get a lot of food. I ordered the Philly cheese stake sandwich. I was disappointed in the lack of flavor, the size was perfect. It came with a side of macaroni salad which is fine.</text><pics>None<//pics><Response>None<//Response>< gmap_id>

This place is the real deal deli! If you order a half a sandwich you will have trouble eating the whole thing. It's usually crowded and parking is tight,but the food is awesome.< /Review>

This has been my favorite San Diego restaurant since 1975, right about when it opened.  Run by couple, very friendly wait staff, great "vibe", astonishing dessert case (s), and as good of food to be found anywhere in town.  They have humungous sandwiches, wonderful huge bowls of delicious soups, and a huge meñu of several pages with small type.  Go!  Go!</text>

They are starting to slack. The bagles were stale, and the chopped liver was made with little boiled egg, and no shmaltz ( chicken fat) so it was bitter. Lazy, and dissapointing. Made me sad.<//text>

I've been dining at DZ Akins for over 20 years now and I'm happy to report that it is still the best authentic Jewish deli in San Diego! There are others that try like Milton's and Samson's but DZ Akins is the real deal!

Also the manager is a super nice fellow named Elan who makes sure everything runs smoothly and is great! Love their fresh baked Breads and bakery items as well as their deli sandwiches and soups! Don't waste your time on the other delis in town if you want a great meal go here! I usually order the soup and mini sandwich which sounds like a small meal but is actually a very large bowl of any of their soups served with what is essentially a normal sized sandwich that they refer to as a half sandwich. Sure to satisfy!</text>

<Rate>3</Rate><Review>Best Jewish delicatessen style restaurant in San Diego. High quality food. No cut corners here. Big room with separate bakery and deli takeout area. Servers are all first rate. They work hard, quickly, and with finesse. Not inexpensive. Much of the staff is family. My only bad experience happened when I politely complained at the cash register that $3.25 was too much to charge for a cup of coffee. Older lady there told me that I didn’t have to eat there, if I thought that was too high. THAT WAS RUDE!!!  $2.00 would be a more appropriate price for coffee. And you know what? Their coffee is just average. Nothing special. And so, I make it a point to NEVER ORDER COFFEE THERE. I think they could trim their prices overall. A great bargain was soup (they make great soup) and half a sandwich. All of a sudden they raised the price by 30-40%.  Big portions. Lots of overweight eaters there. Could be the chopped chicken liver. It’s delicious, but has probably caused a mini epidemic of clogged arteries over the years in San Diego. Still - I love it! There is a Denny’s just perhaps 100 yards away. That chain has steadily gone downhill for over a decade. How they compete with DZ Akins is a mystery to me!< /Review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

Nothing was very good, not even the pickles. They deep fried the bacon, it tasted burnt and had a crust on it. The waffles tasted like from a box. There were tons of salty potatoes...we can do better at home.</text>

Huge menu selection! Great complimentary brined pickles to gnosh. Stacked Ruben sandwich, good cole slaw. What a plate of liver and onions! Tasty chicken-fried steak. Matzo ball soup (softball size...maybe baseball?...big). Tried everything that we had ordered as a family. My cousin who partially grew up in a Jewish community Center in L.A. after school; went to the classic restaurants in L.A. said the spirit, decor, smells and tastes took her back to her childhood.< /Review>

<review>I love this restaurant. We drive from Poway to go there about once every 2 months. I wanted to contact them privately to say i was sad that the potato salad recipe seems to have changed. It had large not so soft lumps of potato in it. It used to be almost mashed potato consistency. Sorry, i just had to say something because i love this place and do not want to see it change. Everything else was great as usual.</review><Name>Marijane Schafer< /Name>< pictures>

<Text>Great sandwich/deli restaurant. Clean surroundings, friendly and responsive service, and quality tasty food. Would give it 5 stars if not for being too pricey for a sandwich/deli restaurant.

Still recommend that you check it out.</Text>< pics>

< review>
This place used to be great. The food was good and so was the service.

It has gone down hill. The food does not taste fresh, and most of the staff look like they would rather be somwhere else.

The omelet I ordered today was supposed to come with cheese, avocado and mushrooms--and it did--but it also came with an unpleasant odor. Those mushrooms were not fresh, and mushrooms need to be fresh or they ruin the entire dish.

The mocha tasted like the chocolate milk you make from Hershey's chocolate syrup. It wasn't bad. It just wasn't great.

The blintzes we got were not good either. We could not taste the filling and the blintzes tasted like they were fried in rancid oil.

Oh, the waitress argued with me about the mushrooms.

Anyway, this place costs substantially more than most other places that serve breakfast. In the past, the quality of the food made up for this.I don't know why people keep coming here.

That's another sign that this place has gone down hill. D.Z. Akins should have been packed at the time we went. There should have been a line out the door, but the place had at least a third of it's tables empty.

I suspect they have lost many of their repeat customers, and it is not hard to see why. As it is right now, this place sucks.

I'm sorry if this offends you. I used to love this place too.</review>

Have been here three times and it is basically a glorified diner. Not Kosher and matza ball soup could easily be made vegetarian but isn't. Not impressed. Our family and friends seem to like it, I am confused why.... Expensive.<//text>

<review>Consistently good food. Used to love the towering pastrami or roast beef sandwiches before I had to cut back on...everything. Don't get me started on the matzo ball and/or kreplach soups or the housemade pickles or the bagels and challah bread or the cookies and rugelach....that's why the restaurant, bakery, and deli are usually bustling and crowded on the weekends for breakfast, brunch, lunch, and linner (I've yet to have a DZ dinner). But, luckily, I live walking distance away. Bagels fo' life!!!!< /review>< Pictures>

My favorite Deli on the West Coast. Parking can be a challenge, yet once you are inside.. the pickles make it all worth the trouble! The service team is on point, professionally friendly, they make a point of going the extra mile for your smile! Next to In-n-Out, DZAkins is a must for me when I return to San Diego. Until I see you again.</review>

If you want a $22 sandwich this is the place to go. It's good food but it's way overpriced. They really think they're all that but they're not.<//text>

I have eaten at D.Z. Akins  for over 30 years and have received excellent food with outstanding service, until now.  While eating a delicious lunch with 2 friends our server dropped a few glasses and plates while emptying our table. The water and food spilled on our table and on our friend's  business proposal papers.

Our server and a helper quickly did a fast but not thorough wiping of the table.  Our server left and her helper tossed us some napkins to clean the table ourselves.  The server and her helper then left abruptly.

Our server did not apologize for her blunder, and a few minutes later delivered our 3 bills with only briskly saying here are your bills.

We were pleasant and did not complain, but our server could have apologized and also have helped us clean our table.  D.Z. Akins has wonderful servers, but this lady was not one.</text>

My wife and I ate here for the first time last week. I have been back three times since then. I can't stop eating here. The food tastes just like me moms cooking, let's be honest, it's better. All their famous dishes are worth every penny. I love the Reuben and the Mazo Brei especially. Dont worry, if you're not used to Jewish food, the servers will help you out with the menu. The food is fantastic and the service is super fast and friendly. What more could you ask for?</Text>

Had a Reuben sandwich with onion rings.  When it came to the table the onion rings were luke warm, I told the waitress she took them back and they cooked some hot and fresh. They make their ranch dressing there it is really good too.</Review>

I was disappointed, I have never had breakfast potatoes that tasted so bad I could not eat them, but today i did. Even the potatoes at Denny’s or Ihop are better. The eggs Benedict holindase sauce has no flavor. This was my third and last time to have breakfast there. Every time I visit the wait staff seems to be rushed. Sorry, I have given too many chances.< /Text>

HOW CHEAP CAN YOU BE? Debi & Zvika, I have been eating at your deli since the 70's and no I am not that old. I brought my wife in for lunch today and ordered a Pastrami sandwich. I asked for it to be grilled instead of plain. My waitress and your manager came over to tell me it was a $3.00 charge to be grilled. No exceptions, that was the policy and basically too bad. I enjoy eating at your deli, I like the food, I like your waitresses and staff. But this was just plain ridiculous. That kind of customer service is not representative of what I expect at your deli.</review>

<name>Dav!d Berg< /name><text>If you don't mind paying extra for the BEST authentic Jewish food in San Diego, this is the place for you.   Best corned beef or pastrami sandwich in town.  The ONLY place you can get decent latkes, kugel, or borscht.   The matzo ball soup is to die for!   Can get crowded at times and difficult to find a parking spot.<//text><rate>5</rate><date>1524002912646<//date>< Pics>

Amazing food, a San Diego staple. Highly recommend the pastrami Reuben. Don't forget to grab an unsliced loaf of challah bread on your way out, it's the best bread for thick, homemade French toast!</text>

Steak Philly w onions mushrooms and mayo, chicken philly w/ light jalapeño, matza ball soup and 1/2 turkey sandwich were all really tasty. Good Bloody Mary too. We'll definitely be back someday when we're in the neighborhood. Prices felt a little high but worth it.</Text>< pics>

It used to be the best Jewish deli in the city, but the prices have gone up and the quality and quantity of the food has gone down.  Still a good place, but not what it was years ago.</Review>

Expensive small portions which wants 10 bucks for a pb&j. When received food was not that great. Maybe the deli and other parts are better but I know dining there was not great. Cramped seating. Please update menus to less items and work on them way to many choices and I think stuff gets lost.<//review>

< review>
I remember always coming here during my college days to get a cheese steak sandwich.  That's all I ever ordered back then.  Well, I returned to San Diego a few weeks back and noticed this place had a groupon option so my bf and I returned.  During our stay in SD, we ate here three mornings in a row.  We were looking for a breakfast joint that could accommodate our dietary restrictions.

We both really enjoyed their lox and onion scrambled eggs.  Instead of potatoes or fruit, we requested the cottage cheese (which tasted really fresh).  I cheated and ate their muffins.  Banana nut muffin, you always get me!

My last return here, I decided to really cheat.  I ordered their matzo ball soup (because I love matzo ball soup and everyone raves about it here), had corned beef hash and my bf ordered their rueben sandwich (half pastrami and half corned beef)  Our lucky day, it was the sandwich special.

It all tasted great!  The matzo ball soup had more carrots than I cared for.  The corn beef hash, yum.  The Reuben sandwich though...especially yum!  We had that with three bean salad.  As a person who usually hates three bean salads, the one here was tasty!  If you like vinegar which I love.

Also, can't forget the pickles!

We also got some stuff from the bakery.  The items that stood out for me was the rolled baklava.  Love me some pistachio baklava.

Wait staff was extremely attentive and courteous.  I would definitely return.< /review>

Came out of the bakery with a good week of supplies in diverse bagels, pastries and bread....everything looked delicious.
What I love about their pastry shop /bakery is that everything looks good but without looking anything but artisanal,  it doesn't look fake/artificial...no over the top too colorful cupcakes or sprinkles....no this is the real deal!
And did I tell you about the cream cheese I got....man!I'm never eating industrial cream cheese again....it changed my life.
About the restaurant,  sure the decor is a bit old fashion but hey....it s part of the charm. The food was absolutely great.... and it is sooooo authentic! We went home with a box and we were glad to be able to enjoy it again.I even liked the pickles and god knows I'm not a fan...the bananasplit was absolutely  huge!!the fudge was delicious!
I love that most of their servers seem to be 40-60 years old ladys, they are super warm and professional.
The place is as big as the portions....gigantic....and just as warm and njce as the servers.
Definitely asking my man to take me back!!< /Review>

I've been living in San Diego before DZ Akins existed. I remember how they began on one end of the building and then slowly took over the Potpourri Art Store and then the entire building. The food is very good and so are the pastries but one thing... there has always been a lingering presence in the air of a kind of arrogance (if you will). Difficult to describe but it is as if the people who work there at the cashiers desk always seem to have a certain something going on as if they have (one-up on you in some way or other). Always nice and pleasant but with an undercurrent that commands a certain type of respect for the insanely high prices they have always charged for all their items. In other words... don't even think about arguing with us about our prices because we ain't coming down!  I've been to Jewish Deli's in New Jersey, New York City and in Miami, FL and they are all pretty much similar to the D Z Akins establishment. Some people are known for gauging the public when it comes to over charging them. It's a known fact. They always have the best to offer but I think that with the very (high) volume that they have (always) had... there is (no) need to charge people such ridiculously high prices for a simple lunch. Yes, you do get a huge amount of whatever in your sandwich but not $20 some odd dollars worth when you ad a drink and a side of potato salad or whatever. It's just way too much to have to pay. That's why I haven't dined there in several years. The owner used to park his Rolls Royce right smack dab in front of the place so all the patrons could see it. Customers would then sit there and ponder why can't this guy drive a toyota and charge us all much less for our sandwich? It's that rubbing his wealth (at our expense) in our faces that was a turn-off. Otherwise, I'd say if you happened to have won the Powerball recently... that is about the only way you could afford to dine there without it leaving you feel as though you were put through a financial hurricane when you got the bill. WHAT? $70 bucks just for lunch for two people? They must be out of their minds. It's just plain old TOO MUCH. That is the kind of money you'd expect to pay to dine at Jakes by the Sea in Del Mar or at George's at the Cove in La Jolla... not in a tiny track mall environment.<//Text>

It's DZ Akins, that's all that needs to be said.  Whether it's breakfast, lunch, or dinner, you're going to have a great meal!  Be prepared to wait during the busy times</review>

DZs is always a welcome pit stop.... Its alwys hard to pass up their bakery after eating... Sammiches are not as big as they used to be it seems, but still are on the bigger & filling side.... We like looking at all the pics on the wall and try to remember the peepses... 4 thumbs up on a scale of 1 to 4.... They have increased prices over the last few years but there is usually plenty of food to share an entré if u gotta eat on the cheep... Or take home part2yummy later ot for lunch tomorrow...<//Review>

Kosher style restaurant, deli and bakery with an attached gift shop. If you need to satisfy your corned beef, pastrami, or matzah ball craving, definitely pop an extra lipitor and come here.  You can lie to your cardiologist later.  Vegetarians beware, there isn't much for you.</Text>

Good food, good portions. It's fairly busy. My family was moved after being placed for a good while at a previously reserved table which was awkward. Guy apologized and told us we'd get free latkes but that never came.< /review>

Not only do they have a fun and whimsical bakery featuring hello kitty, pickachu,  and pokeballs, they also have a deli with delicate meats and cheeses. Their Matzo ball soup was the first thing I tired and it was a wonderful blend of saltiness and the full satisfaction of comfort food. The portion sizes are also to be noted, because the soup was huge, I could not finish my main dish of mushroom chicken.<//Text>< resp>

< review>
This Jewish Deli/Restaurant is a gem of San Diego. You feel like you're in New York City when you go in there. The pastrami on rye is great. I love the corned beef hash and eggs. On the weekends they have Bialys. Sucha treat. And the bakery. Fresh cookies and cakes, breads, hallahs, bagels. We love the coconut macaroons (gluten-free).<//review>

They have now raised their price on a Pepsi from a whopping 3.00 for about 8 oz with a glass full of ice to 3.50!  I simply cannot justify 20.00 before tip for a sandwich, fries, and a drink!  So sad to see them gouging customers like that.  Bye DZ Akins!</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmap_id>

<review>Coffee is awful, but everything else is really flavorful and well done!

5 stars for an excellent bakery selection. I especially like the chocolate brownies and the poppy seed danish. I order things to go and then go home and make my own coffee to enjoy with bakery treats!

Also fantastic - the bagels! Onion bread is also a fine, egg-based (?) bread, mmm

Deli has a fresh selection of pickled herring, whitefish salad, and coleslaw (not too creamy just how I like it!). Order it to go with some bagels and you have a healthy, delicious meal! Great for snacks if you want wine time with your laughing pack of gfs.

Bakery and deli, mmm..</review>< Pics>

D.Z.Akin's is one of the best delicatessens in San Diego County. The restaurant was brought together by a couple who came to San Diego from Los Angeles ; the idea was that San Diego needed a good deli and after years of hard work, the deam came to fruition.The staff is very professional and extremely friendly and last time that I was there my waitress was there whenever I needed a refill on my tea or just to check to see how I was doing.
Akin's serves over twenty-five different types of kosher sandwiches; using two meat and cheese combinations.
They serve a four meat and cheese special that will set you back about twenty- five dollars however, you may need a 'doggie bag.'
Each sandwich comes with a choice of either a regular salad, a homemade potato salad, or a delicious three bean salad; there are plenty of side dishes to complete your meal - I suggest the fried onion rings. And don't forget the tasty Jewish dill pickles; they are compimentary, as well as different mustards too.
I tried the "Philly steak and provolone cheese sandwich on a hot French roll" and it was awesome! I also ordered a glass of dark tea - refills were complementary; their tea is a good quality tea.
D.Z.AKIN'S also serves large dinners and other kosher foods that all have that special Jewish flair. One may request special alternatives however, substitutions are usually not approved. The bakery in the front of the store sells awesome pastries; I liked the vanilla creme chocolate eclairs ; they are so big that it takes two days to eat just one. Their "creme puff" was huge whipped creme confection, filled with thick vanilla creme.The cookies are sweet and everything is baked on the premises.
Their milk shakes are a "retro" 50's style that are thick and creamy, topped with a towering swirl of real home made whipped cream and a marichino cherry - last time I was there I had a Kuahuala chocolate delight however, unless I had a friend who offered to treat : I should have learned that lesson long ago; that those who give to freely never get anything in return; it's a lesson that everyone should learn and the younger you learn it the wiser and perhaps the wealthier you may be. God never bestows riches upon people who ask Him.
Their is also a very well stocked kosher meat area where one can purchase various sliced meats to create their own smorgasbord for a small intimate get-to-together, as well as a made to order catering service.
The inside of D.Z.Akin deli sports a large   collection of black and white photographs - some colour ones too - of immemorial celebrities, as well as a few of the newer movie stars and a number of world renowned people too; it's a step back in time for those of us who are were living during the time before producers started relying on blue and green screens, computer generated animatronics and "fake" props/images to create realistic scenarios - to fool the ignorant masses.The results have still been fantastic, creating movies where the audience becomes part of the scene itself, especially in 3-D.
The inside of the deli has also been painted with beautiful scenes of D.Z.Akin's everyday life scenes that echo the soul of this deli; paintings so well done that they seem to also have that 3-D effect on the eyes, especially if you look at them for long enough...
D.Z. Akin's also has a guaint little souvenir shoppe
in the front of their store where they sell really nice cards - that commemorate all Jewish holidays as well as any gentile related holidays, such as Christmas, Thanksgiving, etc; there are some beautiful figurines that are relatively inexpensive; I purchased several neat little cat statuettes to add to my collection of animal likenesses and with Halloween just around the corner, there are all kinds of neat and inexpensive little gifts that are less than $10.
There is plenty of parking and one can hook up with The San Diego Trolley Green Line from any other trolley line ,as well as many transit busses to easily reach D.Z.Akin's.</review>

Don't get me wrong... our family loves DZ and has been going for a LONG time!  But lately it's been "hit or miss".. there is a lack of consistency across dishes and across visits.

The ginormous sandwiches are BOMB diggity.. corned beef and pastrami are delightful... although, I always get chopped liver and/or liverwurst.  Either way, awesome!  I also enjoy the table-side, homemade pickles.. and choices of mustard.  My mom and I frequently get the half-sandwich and soup special.  The Borscht is refreshing on a hot day!

They also have a breakfast special on weekdays from 7am to 11am which consists of Two Large Buttermilk Hotcakes, Two Eggs, Two Strips of Bacon or Two Links of Sausage for $3.99... and they do an early bird dinner special from 4-6pm.

Like I said, we love DZ... but, at times, the bread has been rubbery... the food cold.. the waitress without enthusiasm... one time the waitress even exclaimed "that's not my favorite" after a nearby patron made her order... shouldn't you sell the food you serve?  Not bash it?  And one time we were asked to move by some strange lady who never introduced herself... then, when we didn't, she came back to explain that she was the owner and needed our table.  Should have said that the first time!

So... basically.. if you're going to DZ Akins, go Jewish fare and/or eat a ginormous, double decker sandwich!  Oh yeah.. and don't forget to grab some bakery goods on the way out!  Well worth the price!<//review>

It's not the place I remember when I moved to San Diego. My pastrami sandwich was small and cold. Our waiter was more worried about his regulars. I will not be back again.< /Review>

Have to agree with others here that the place is definitely over-priced, and the food is kind of so-so bland, but the portions are generous. Not quite up to "Great Jewish Deli" status. Oh, how we miss Herschel's in Encinitas... Now that was fabulous food at a fair price!</text>

It's a "Jewish-style" deli, so don't come looking for your grandma's recipes but it has decent enough food and large portions. I wouldn't recommend things like their pancakes, but I enjoy the matzah ball soup and their sandwiches.<//Text>

<review>Well, i write this with such sadness. I have been going to DZ Akin's for 16 years, the "Manager" Debra, who has in my opinion been a very friendly manager. I was a GM of a restaurant for nearly 30 years give or take. I have a couple of things to address after being a a loyal customer as i have said 16 years. 7 weeks ago i had the lower third of my spine fused, major surgery, When i finaIy felt able i went to have my favorite Friday Fish and chips( PS: I move from England 33 years ago) Debra the manager even though i'm struggling with my walker, takes us past several empty tables and sits us in the very back, you know where the bathrooms are. I said gee with my walker you couldn't seat us a little closer to the door where i m parked in the handicapped parking spot. (her reply) "well, i don't know how bad your condition is"!!!!  With the surgery i recently got put on a very strict diet for medical reasons complications, so continued going each Friday for my fish and chips ( a little bit of home) every week the waitresses are awesome and sub a salad for the fries as i can no longer have fries to my horror.
"BAM"
Last Night Friday August 5th sat down asked my waitress so bored of salad and coleslaw can i get baked beans and cottage cheese, no problem.
Our waitress comes back,"I am so sorry NO substitutions on the fish and chips" i said thats not possible have substituted for the past two months since i was told no more potatoes. Then Debra, the manager comes over and repeats, yes, no substitutions. i explained to her everything i cant eat potatoes, and they have always substituted, i would be happy just give me one side instead of two. NO!
She then had the nerve to my discuss to say point out the waitresses that have substituted because they shouldn't be. I said NO i am not going to let you attack them the way you are me for giving me substitutions. (My Partner said" better idea, instead of asking to point out your staff just tell everyone at the next staff meeting.) She looked at me and said give me one name and i'll give you one side..............
ONLY because of the medication i was so drugged on did i stay.
Alas i will never be back at DZ akin's again, i want to thank all the wonderful waitress that have taken care of us over the 16years.
But, Debra, you have no business being a manager of any restaurant at all. I never would or did i treat a customer the way you treated us last night. If i was the owner "I WOULD FIRE YOU"
i am posting this on all social media and forwarding a printed copy to your store owner. I have never had to write such a review of any where in such a bad way.
I did not want to give any stars

Most of my experiences at DZ's have been normal.  It was quite different this morning.  What happen was I could not believe the the bill this morning.  I was charged $7 for two orders of coffee's, and when I mention my surprise at the register all I receive was disparaging answer.  Needless to say 'if' I return I wont order coffee.<//text>

The menu is equisite. Something to excite the most finciky of palette's. The service is impeccable. NOT over attentive,they return to your table when you require their service without signaling or voice commands. One of the finest water/waitress staff's in San Diego.I tip my hat to this hidden culinary jewel. I seen reviews of "over-priced" sandwich's. Nonsense..! The sandwich's are worth every penny. From the bread to the contents in between are of the highest quality...Hands down..!
If I had to choose from 'turf-n-surf' or a DZ Akins snadwich I would choose the latter.You'll most likely need a to-go-box for the DZ choice over the turf-n-surf meal from your fav restaurant..
This place is good,and deserves a try. Many comfort foods on the menu.  (Thanx Beckah for gettin me hooked on their Reubin-doin the remodel)</Text>

I can't swear this is Kosher, since you can get most anything on your plate, but you just might lick your plate clean. Large portions.
Try the brisket. Try the pastrami.</Text>

This time was fine, problem with D.Z.Akin's is their quality is not consistent, so they e times the food is great and tasty, some times it's horrible. Lots of free parking.<//review>

Over priced for what you get in the bakery it is good but 16$ for a treat is crazy also there are no prices posted on anything so I get my ticket and almost fell over at the cost<//Review>

A favorite for years(?) decades (?)  It's gotten a little pricey, but it I as good as any deli in New York.  Try the shopped liver.  To die for.</Review>

<Name>DeDe O<//Name><review>This place is a mixed bag. My family moved here right when the pandemic started so we just recently were able to dine-in. We love ordering bagels to-go. This might be the first and last time we visit in person though.

The bakery is great for take-out; bagels are superb! The sit down experience at breakfast was very different. The server was nice but not very attentive. Whizzed by a couple of times, and failed to notice I didn’t eat my food at all because it was frankly inedible. That’s partly on me; it was something new to me but also, it was totally flavorless (like, zero seasoning) and cold when it came out. Maybe that’s normal? IDK. Some people probably like that. It is baffling the server didn’t seem to care or notice an entire plate of food was untouched. I could have asked for something else or a refund but I figured she’d offer a solution. Nope.

My parents food seemed fine but definitely overpriced. And $3.50 for a cup of coffee?! I wish I had paid attention to the price before hand. I have never heard of a restaurant charging more than $3 for regular ol’ joe.

No one asked to refresh our water. We only got offered a coffee refill once. I’ve worked in several restaurants myself and this place wasn’t busy enough to justify the lack of attention.
And  2/3 water cups were dirty. I know dishes get “sanitized” but there was food and OJ “baked” (for lack of a better description) into the cheap plastic cups.

Last but not least, it took until literally the very end for any plates, etc. to get cleared.

We will come back for bagels and pastries, but dining in is unlikely. I hope others get better food and service than we did.<//review></record>

The coffee tastes great, the breakfast is very tasty, the menu is very extensive and they have healthy options if you request it. The decoration is vintage, very "Wonderful years", on the walls you will find photographs of celebrities from the 70's and 80's. I recommend it, I would definitely like to come back.
