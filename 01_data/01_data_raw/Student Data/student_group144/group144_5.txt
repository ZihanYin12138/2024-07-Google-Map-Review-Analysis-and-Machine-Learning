They took a great one and made it even better! After a year's wait, when they changed locations, Mom's Tofu house is finally open again in South City.  Our patience was worth it - this location serves some of the best Korean food in the  area.
Highlights:
Home made tofu has an amazing silky texture, whether it's in an appetizer or one of the hot tofu soups. You can choose the spice level to taste - whatever you pick, the deep underlying flavor of the soup and protein comes through in spades.
Individually made rice portions. I didn't think I'd care, but this is a really nice touch. Fresh short grain Korean, wonderfully textured, accompanies your meal. This level of detail is apparent in all their dishes!
Barbeque - again, you can't go wrong, from the short ribs to the spicy chicken. Excellently done.
Each time we've come in (and we're regulars), the service is attentive,  personable and warm. I think the expansion in space (compared to the old location) has made for a better customer experience - there's space in between tables and enough staff to take care of each section well.
I love this place - it has a high spot in the regular rotation.< /text>

Mom’s tofu is hands down my favorite restaurant in South San Francisco. I used to frequent the old location before they relocated. When I heard they were opening a new location, I was very excited. Excellent food and fantastic, friendly service. The secret behind their silken soft tofu is it that the tofu is made fresh on site. Furthermore, the rice is made to order. That’s right, the rice is prepared fresh for you. Portion sizes are filling and the side dishes are refreshing. Mom’s tofu is located downstairs inside the building. Give them a try!<//Text>

A really authentic Korean restaurant in California may not be so rare, but they are also not so accommodating to their dinner guests. We had my son's pet dog with us and so he searched online for a restaurant that would accept pets (dogs/cats) as dinner guests. We were delighted that they had a couple of table outside the front the restaurant., which perfected suited our ride-along pet. We were  visiting San Francisco since I was departing the next day, but we glad to have found a very tasty Korean meal at  pet-friendly restaurant. Good meal, great vibes. Most of the clientele were actually Korean-Americans, so you know it has to be authentic.</text>

<text>Some of the better soondubu I've had up here so far. Side dishes are all good, soup boiling hot and will burn your tastebuds off. Relatively small place so either order takeout ahead or be prepared to wait during busy times. If I lived closer I'd eat here at least once a week, but I'll settle for twice a month.</text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNqf5O2WhLN-fHhPkxBxgJCCTbGe7UUp35XuqHo=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO9FNOxr5UtpFk8GUuuUpAGeHBMzqLYSIjoWs9N=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics><rating>5<//rating><GmapID>0x808f796c438637d3:0xbd71258409ed4dc5<//GmapID>< UserId.>

This place’s only goal is to make money, they have no minimum decency to treat their customers properly. They clearly have NO idea of what customer service means. We were on the top of the waiting list and waited nearly an hour for a 2ppl table. When they finally freed up 3 tables, they insisted us either take the table by the rest room or to keep waiting because they need to give the other tables to accommodate bigger groups. We were like Hell NO! First they should never put a table by the restroom where there is disgusting smell and germs to sit your customers. Secondly, it’s the common sense that you respect your waiting list - first come first serve. If they can sit you by the restroom, who knows how clean their kitchen can be. I would say stay away from this place if you don’t want get sick or disgusted. Good flavor is not the only thing that matters! By the way, the servers there were super arrogant, ignorant and unfriendly.</text>

Small but popular Korean restaurant with a few vegetarian options, including a vegetarian bibimbap and broiled tofu with spicy vegetables. Fast, courteous service, and dinner entrees are served with a variety of pickled vegetables. A small cup of sweet Korean toasted rice punch ends each meal on a light note. Although the address is on Grand Avenue, the entrance is actually a few steps off Grand facing a small parking lot, so don't walk past by accident.</Review>

My 10 yrs old girl wrote her name on the waiting list and we were next in line for a table. 3 adults came in after, we told them that they need to sign in on the wait list. The man said he informed the waitress already and refused to write their name on the wait list.

The waiter called my daughter’s name when they had the table cleaned. At the same time, the waitress called the other group and the man just rushed over to the clean table and sat down.

We told them staffs that we were here before them but the waitress insisted that they were here first.
By the way, the group of 3 are Korean and speaking Korean to the waitress. So I just decided to let them have the table and i took my business somewhere else!!< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

No frills, satisfying Korean food.<//Text><username>Kaay S</username>< UserId.>

Very nice Korean restaurant with good food, good service, easy parking, and decent seating.  Prices here are a little higher than the usual run of the mill Korean restaurant, but the food is worth it.  That being said though, I had to take one star off of my recent visit because my seafood pancake was a little undercooked which shouldn't happen for the price.  But overall I definitely like this place and will continue to dine here.</Text>

I am a regular there for a reason. Love the self serve side dishes and the food is delicious. The stone pot is always super hot, which is a requirement for good Korean bowl or soup.  It is definitely a home cook type of place.
If you get a chance, try the spicy chicken wings. Their special recipe makes it crispy and spicy.

4/19/19 Update: Mama's tofu no longer exist at the Grand Ave. in SSF.  There are few other locations on El Camino.<//text>

If you are coming here with 4 or more, early arrival is suggested since the restaurant is quite small. You can try and call ahead to reserve a table, but it may not be guaranteed if you are a big group.

From what I remember, the food is affordable and the service was good and the staff was really nice. Mom really does take care you at her restaurant.

On a side note, if you order the fried chicken, they give you a lot. It's a good dish to share.</Text><Rate>4< /Rate><user_name>Fran V< /user_name><Response>None< /Response><user>116975083610067495627< /user><Pictures>None</Pictures></record></dataset><record>

Tofu (spicy) with pork was the best I've had in the bay (and by spicy they do mean spicy unlike some other tofu houses) . The bibimbap was also delicious with the spicy pork. The place is small and packed so make sure to put your name on the board inside and prepare for a 15+ minute wait during dinner. Service is very quick and friendly. I can't wait to come back here!</Review>

Some good Korean food, all the usual Korean food was available, although the seasoning felt a little bland. The jap chae noodle dish, usually my favorite at a restaurant just didn't taste that flavorful. Otherwise the other people in my group seemed to enjoy the food.<//text>

Great Korean restaurant. We went there when our cousin from Chicago visited us and she loves it. The food options is same as most Korean restaurants in the city - tofu soup, beef sparerib, bibimbap, etc. We ordered the seafood pancake, beef spareribs, chicken wings, spicy beef noodle and three tofu soups, seafood, mushroom and beef, which it's delicious especially on a cold and rainy day, but it is a little salty. Don't order the chicken wing, which is OK.< /review>

Good food, but we have eaten better food at myun dong tofu cabin at marina plaza, San Mateo. I have eaten like 30/40 times at myun dong tufu cabun. This is our first time here as we moved to this town. Good food and friendly people. I like them overall. Will come again with smile.<//review>

I was expecting a little more. I liked the ban chan which came with kimchi, bean sprouts, radish, fish cake, potato salad, and a pancake. The chicken wings were cooked well, but the seasoning on the dry ones and the sauce on the wet ones weren't exciting. I enjoyed the short ribs, which were a good portion size and nice and tender but the tofu stew was a little bland and a bit skimpy on the meat.

I wouldn't mind giving it one more shot, but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here.<//text>

<Text>It was my first time at this place and I loved it. It's a pretty small shop, so it's fairly cramped when the place is full. There is usually a wait for lunch. The price for the food is reasonable and the banchan is all you can eat with a meal. I had the Beef hot stone pot bibimbap and that was just what I needed. It was super hot, really filling, and I felt pretty healthy afterwards. Definitely coming back again to try more things. My friend recommends getting the seafood tofu stew with rice.<//Text>< Pics>

<text>How I miss having a go-to Korean place around the corner. This isn't exactly around the corner from me, but I think it's my new guilty pleasure!

The restaurant is small but has plenty of tables. Turnaround is really fast so you don't have to wait too long to get a seat. It was packed on a Thursday night at 8pm.

Lots of banchan and you get a small sized veggie pancake for free too. Service is awesome. We got 2 tofu soups and 1 kalbi. The kalbi was great and came first. It was a heaping pile! The tofu soup left something to be desired. I like that they give you an egg (some places don't give you one!). But I asked for medium spicy and it wasn't spicy at all. The broth was very thin and not that flavorful. Maybe that's just how they make it versus other places? I don't know.

(Free parking is awesome.)<//text><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

It's a workhorse lunch spot for the droves of hungry pharmaceutical company workers and locals. There's nothing that hits the spot quite like korean food on a dreary SSF day. My favorite there is the yukgaejang with a bright red soup and a healthy mix of vegetables, meat and noodles - beware the impending food coma. I've also had the soondubujjigae (Tofu soup), of which Mom's Tofu House is named for, and you can never go wrong with a spicy tofu soup. Their bimbimbap is lovely and generous - don't forget to add the spicy red sauce when you get it.<//Review><rating>4< /rating>< response>

<text>Mom's Tofu House is a small little Korean restaurant tucked away on Grand Ave...with some great Korean dishes!

I usually come here during my lunch break from work, and as long as you get there before noon, you'll be able to get a seat and a table without a wait. Once the clock strikes noon however, the people from the surrounding areas start trickling in, and before you know it, you're hit with a mass of people on their lunch break, all waiting for a seat and table. If you get there after noon, you might have to wait a bit before getting a table.

The best part about this place is that the mini Korean side dishes (kimchi, fish cake, salad, potatoes, etc.) are all placed together in a side bar area. This side bar area is self serve and you can refill your own plate as many times as you want.

Along with the unlimited side dishes, I usually also order a spicy beef soon dubu (beef tofu soup) which comes with an egg (crack it open and throw it in your soup) and a small bowl of steamed white rice. There are 5 levels of spiciness, and I find the 4th level (spicy) to be the most optimal. Anything more than the 4th level is too spicy to be enjoyable.

Prices are relatively cheap (as far as Korean places go), and the service is quick and friendly.

I would definitely recommend this place for lunch!</text><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None<//resp>< Gmap_id>

Mom's serves a tasty veggie pancake as a complimentary appetizer. I usually order the bibimbap in the stone bowl and have the waitress refresh the banchan (small dishes) at least twice, during dinner at a minimum of three times.

We come here only during the weekends. Their parking lot is usually full so we end up parking across the street, putting quarters in the meter during lunch.<//text>< Rate>

Low key lunch or dinner spot in SSF. Definitely come here for either the soft tofu soups (their specialty) or the lunch bento specials. As with other Korean places, the banchan side dishes are complementary. There are about 6-8 different banchans, and sometimes they throw in a complementary kimchi pancake. For lunch, the banchan is buffet style, so you can grab as much as you want (but don't be wasteful!).Their lunch special bentos are a good size, with a protein + rice, japchae noodles, a dumpling, buffet style banchan, and a small miso soup. Definitely a great place for lunch, though it's small, so it's best to go with a group of 6 people or less.< /text>

Good and spicy Korean food, with the expected banchan. Only problem is that the owners seem to take unexpected long holidays.</text>

Below average quality Korean food, even for Bay Area standards, which aren't the highest.

The tofu soup was water and galbi (short ribs) was not seasoned / marinated well - bland, leaning salty.<//review>

Really think this place is over-rated. Food is just OK and line is always long. We were extremely upset when knowing our phone reservation didn't mean anything once we arrived. They just moved our name already on the board to the last in line upon our arrival.< /Text>

(Translated by Google) The food is delicious! Korean food that is not too spicy or too salty, high price.
But waiting for about 20 minutes because it is full.

食物很好吃！不會太辣或太鹹的韓國料理，偏高價。
但因客滿在外面等待約20分鐘。</text>

<review>(Translated by Google) It's a little narrow, so you have to wait outside and it's frustrating, but it's delicious tofu, stone hotpot and pajeon.

<review>Need to come early for clothing drop off. I'm hoping people will be able to use the nice clothing that is too small for me.
Also, the donations help support those with cancer as well as research.< /review><response>None</response><gmapID>0x809ac7127d427e37:0xe3d767a3067b9d7f< /gmapID>< Rate>

The volunteers are very helpful and friendly.
I always donate there and all the volunteers are courteous and kind.

If you're looking for anything particularly nice  clothes, coats or shoes you'll find what you need.< /review>

Some people are  so rude when they cannot
Get things for almost free. This is a nonprofit organization and thelygood  things move fast. If u are unhappy you  don't  need to  shop here. I love the place and yes some of the time I don't find what I'm  looking for. I just  return another time for reasonably  priced treasures.</Review>

Great place to donate & great place to shop, they are true to selling reusable goods not other people's junk. And who's family hasn't been touched by cancer?  A great place to donate your dollars.</Text>

GOOGLE MAPS IS WRONG!!
Directions go up a private one lane dead end road. Very stressful experience backing down.</text>

The perfect balance of intensity and distance for hiking. There are multiple vantage points to appreciate the valley that surrounds them. Definitely a must for anyone who enjoys exercising or exploring new hiking trails!</Review>

Not much shade, but a nice hike early morning or late afternoon. A good secluded escape from the city, but close enough to not be a huge commitment.

Saw a bunch of animals too. Nice for a nature nerd like me. Interesting to see the remaining fire damage, but nice to see plants starting to grow back already.

The remains of a deer I came across made the "Dangerous Animals" warning sign a bit more heed-able lol.<//Review>

I was glad I went to Verdugo Mountain Park today with my friend Isaac. Not just to go hiking get away for a bit and be out doors explores and view the surrounds cities in California. Burbank, Village Valley, North Hollywood, Sun Valley, Tujunga as you could also see the view of Hollywood Burbank Airport and explore the outside doors enjoy your time up in Verdugo Mountain Park. 😇💙💜☯️🌬< /text>

A good challenge climb with a mountain bike, not too crowded. Parking is really close to the entrance, I highly recommend this spot.</text>

<text>Respectful, Fast, and Easy. That was my experience with Mr. Sang, it is also the experience I was looking for when I was researching smog check centers. His business has been open for the past 7 years so he is also trustworthy. Thank you Mr. Sang, I will be coming back for another smog check when the dmv issues me another notice.< /text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

<time>1617389310473<//time><review>We started coming to Sang's years ago after my father-in-law recommended him and he has been great every time. He is very helpful (I actually had my car break down while I was trying to get it smogged and he helped me get running again so I could come back after it was repaired).

One note: he is located in a small building with few parking spots. If you go during the day, the other businesses are also open and parking can be rough. He works by himself so be aware that you just might need to sit tight while cars are juggled around. But it is definitely worth it.< /review></record>

<Text>Mr. Sang is polite, professional and efficient, and his prices are reasonable. Despite the heat, his office is kept cool (and it's clean and tidy), and he graciously offered me an cold bottle of water while I waited for the smog check to be completed. My car passed on the first try with no problem, but he offers you one free re-test in case it doesn't.

This is my second time coming to him and I plan to come back to see him whenever the DMV requires it. Thank you, Mr. Sang!< /Text><pictures>None</pictures><response>None</response><gmap_id>0x80dcd64ae6f83d15:0x1c6b52da71d83278<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<review>When it’s time to get your car smogged, come here and support Sang. He’s a friendly and honest gentlemen that gets the job done quick. He gives you a brief run-down of what he’s going to do, what it will cost, and what to do if you car doesn’t pass, all before you agree to any work being done. There’s a yummy taqueria in the same lot where you can grab a quick bite while you wait, otherwise you can hang out at Sang’s. There’s a small couch and chairs area with a tv and coffee table of magazines. -1 star for the waiting area because you are kinda just sitting right there in the shop.. but it’s a small place.  I was out the door in 20 mins with a passing certificate, thanks Sang!< /review>< name>

Very good service,  gentlemen doing test was very nice and attentive. Gave me cold water bottle before service started. I highly recommend this Star smoke check station. Very good price of $37 for test and $8 for certificate- electronically sent to DMV. There is a Mexican restaurant next door if you choose  to do your test while you have  bite. Also Free retest if your car do not pass.< /review>

Sang is the sweetest! My aunt was looking for a place to get her car smog and I was actually recommend this place by my mom. It's super close to her house so I thought it would give it a try. Right when we got there, he greets you and explains what he'll be doing. He invited you to his "waiting area" (so cute lol) and offers you something to drink.
He inspects your car and BEFORE doing the tests, he comes back and tells you the prices. Once you fill out paper work, he performs the testing and that's it! You pay (he accepts Mastercard & VISA), and your on your way. I would definitely recommend him. Thank you Sang!< /text>

<Review>Went in for a smog and Sang was very helpful. He started off with a great first impression because when I showed up he shook my hand and introduced himself... That NEVER happens anywhere! I knew I was going to be in good hands. Then he hands me a cold water bottle while I wait!!! Best service at a smog shop!< /Review><gmapID>0x80dcd64ae6f83d15:0x1c6b52da71d83278< /gmapID>< pics>

<rating>5<//rating><Review>I've just discovered this smog station and im glad I did, from the start Mr. Lee reached out shook my hand and introduced himself which I thought to be very professional and respectful which also took me by surprise because as a customer you just don't get that anymore. He proceeded with the service and in between he offered me a cold bottle of water while I waited, he was done in less than 20 minutes. He then shook my hand again and thanked me. I would recommend this place to anyone and I will definitely be taking my cars back to him when they need to be smogged!<//Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

Great little smog testing shop.  Very friendly one-man-band owner.  He offers bottled water while you wait.  He seems very professional and detail oriented.  He must have done it thousands of time.  Zap, zap, zap.  Done.  Pay.  Thank You.  Drive away.<//text>

<Review>The man working here, mr. Sang i think is his name, or mr. Lee from what a certificate on the wall says, is a very kind man, I was 2nd in line and he works very fast and effeciently, even gave me a nice cold water bottle. I would reccomend this place to anybody looking to get their car a smog test.< /Review>< Pics>

One of the smoothest transactions I’ve ever done. Coming from Auto Brokerage myself April went above and beyond the moment truly genuine and super patient upon arrival and completion. Fast and easy process working with April. Great negotiation and was able to meet me halfway with my expectations. I highly recommend this dealer to anyone. The car we purchased exceeded our goals with my family

A++ will definitely recommend all my family and friends!!<//Review>

This dealership is top notch! Working with Matthew was a dream!! First of all, I love their "Soup to Nuts" approach...their salespeople are trained to handle your transaction start to finish. I purchased a 2018 Mercedes CLS550. Upon my arrival, Matthew was fully prepared with the Carfax, original purchase sticker and all other materials I requested. This was a conversation not a high-pressure sale. He did everything just right.....I could not be happier!!< /text>

Extremely pleased with our experience with OC Autohaus. We located the car we wanted through many hours of internet/car apps. Johnny was quick to reach out to us. He got the process moving. He was very helpful and real. Traveling from out of the area, he helped keep us in touch. We texted back and forth. He even recommended driving back home along the Pacific Coast HWY. We had a great brunch in Santa Barbara while cruising in our new ride. Thanks for the suggestion. The selection is great at this location. Lots of Lexus :>)  I would say the interior of the vehicle should have been cleaner for this level of car. The business was closed on Sunday morning but they came in to accommodate our purchase.< /text>

<review>I bought a lower end vehicle from them back in May 2020, a 2015 Toyota Corolla with 53k miles

I have myself to blame as I didn't bother inspecting the vehicle myself, based off the high end cars, I just trusted off the look that all would be good.

Well after the fact and signing off paperwork, I looked at my purchased vehicle, all 4 tires were cracking, I was able to drive 5 months, 3-3,500 miles before the wobbling/braking finally got so bad and I bought new tires in October 2020 for $520

The right rear window wouldn't go down from the time I bought the car from the master switch or the right rear itself, one of cheaper fixes I've had on this card.

About a week after delivery, the AC stopped blowing cold, it was evident the car was just filled with Freeon to avoid them replacing the AC condenser. My mechanic took care of this and when he took apart the parts, the current condenser parts were from a different year, which tells me the car definitely had a front impact damage at some point

There is visible gap on the front bumper, along with the paint starting to peel off about a month in, (flat black paint btw) not pearl like the actual paint.

I fixed the serpentine belt at 57k miles, no biggie, what was big and unexpected was yesterday's repair of a motor mount, 2 wheel bearings, and sway bar links, which to be honest, there was a clunk noise from the get go, but my mechanic didn't notice an issue in the beginning

It's obvious this car was just took on trade, prettied up, pics taken and put up for sale, I'm expecting a response showing we inspect all cars, if so, ask for an inspection report, if one is not presented right there and then, then you know they're buying time to make one up, and in my case I wouldn't have had to go smog the car myself because they "forgot "

Again 95% of it falls on me for not looking at the car, I do thank Kifah for helping me get my loan, and the interest rate he helped me get, he's a great guy, sadly this falls on the car dealerships ownership, not him.

Sure I did get a small discount, but getting an unsafe car(cracked tires, no smog etc) doesn't validate that.

Please make sure to get your possible purchase inspected by a mechanic of YOUR choosing, ask for a multi point inspection report done by them before posting(they must have one in each cars deal jacket) and remember Carfax isn't everything, a car can have a previous accident and go unreported if fixed under the table, like in the case of my vehicle.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

My buddy and I flew from out of town and drove the car home within 2 hours of arriving, checking it out and filling out paperwork. Darius was more than happy to put the car on a lift for us to inspect and he was very open and honest as to when/how they acquired the car. Their inventory is very extensive. They carry all sorts of high end luxury and sports cars. I would highly recommend someone to check out the cars on their lot and don't hesitate to consider them when making a purchase!<//text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOeXYJ-up40rhmmEWLa-xtjWtPI1KBT32LvEP3n=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP7tVo9WPTZZwdWQZAI9Fk9RjurcO6kyBmAJVt0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOEPhXTpZmNAeANi-ffgGiq8PPFVze7EDCmF6xp=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures><Response>None<//Response><gmap_id>0x80dd289e9a34f22f:0x698cd472c4ede48b</gmap_id></record>

I had a great experience buying a used Porsche Panamera at OC Autohaus. They really went above and beyond. Friedel was super helpful. I wanted to inspect the car at an authorized dealership 20 miles away and there was no hesitation and Friedel came with me to the dealership where we waited over 3 hours to get the inspection complete.  Back at OC Authhaus the whole process of buying the car was easy and honest with a minimum time spent at the dealership. Just before I left Friedel drove to put in some more gas for my way home. Overall, this was a really great experience, I recommend OC Authhaus to anyone looking to purchase a high end vehicle.<//text>

< Review>
Had a great experience with OC Autohaus.  Even though I live in Sherman Oaks (a 45 minute drive away), Antuan made everything from the test drive to the final sale very easy for me, through text messages and emails.  And when I finally came to pick up the car, all the paperwork was completed and ready for my signature.  The car was detailed and waiting for me to drive home.  My wife and I were in and out and back on the road in my new car with 15 minutes!   THANKS AGAIN for making the whole process so easy for me.  And with a great car at a great price, I couldn't be happier!<//Review>

<review>I recently purchased a 2007 Porsche Carrera from this dealership. I live in New York and went out of my way to find this vehicle and have it shipped home only to find out that this car was severely abused overtime and needed an entirely new transmission along with brakes and brake rotors clutch the works! I purchased this car for 35,000 and had to pay an additional 15,000 to get it safe and road ready. We have been in touch with the dealership since we received the news from our mechanic that this car was totally shot and very likely a race vehicle Due to the extensive damage sustained on the brake rotors braking system and transmission. Despite our exhausting efforts this dealership refuse to own up and do the right thing steer clear of OC Auto Haus. Because we trusted this dealership we are now in the process of pursuing legal action against these scumbags.<//review>< userid>

<response>{'time': 1590275527033, 'text': 'We at OC Autohaus completely understand your pain, but we’re unable to meet your demands due to the following important facts:\n\n1) Prior to making purchase, you paid for professional pre-purchase inspection through a national vehicle inspection service (www.LemonSquad.com) and then based your purchasing decision on the inspection results. Your paid inspector had no affiliation of any kind with OC Autohaus.\n\n2) You purchased your Porsche from OC Autohaus “As Is - No Dealer Warranty” as evidenced by multiple signed documents. And you declined to purchase an extended warranty.\n\n3) Your issues occurred almost 3 months after an “as is” purchase for a 13 years old vehicle with almost 75,000 miles.\nDespite these important facts, OC Autohaus was still willing to help in reaching out and offering you our assistance in purchasing repair parts at wholesale prices. You declined that offer.\n\nYou then suggested that we help you with the costs of the water pump and brakes. However, as we were considering that request, you then threatened us with legal action and negative social media posts.\n\nThis Porsche came to us with the highest possible quality grade (a 5.0 Condition Report). We performed our own safety inspection before listing it. You then had this Porsche independently inspected whose inspection results apparently confirmed our quality assessment. Clearly, we had absolutely no reasons to expect any such major issues as reported by you.\nFrom a seller of luxury automobiles to a nation-wide marketplace, we firmly believe that we haven’t done anything wrong. We genuinely wish that we could help to make you feel better, but at this point we can’t in the face of threats of legal action and destructive social media posts.\n\nStay safe and healthy.'}</response><Gmap_id>0x80dd289e9a34f22f:0x698cd472c4ede48b< /Gmap_id><Pictures>None</Pictures></record>

My wife and I where in town to buy our daughter a car.  We are so lucky we ran into OC Autohaus.  The customer service was top notch! I've purchased and sold quite a bit of cars, this was by FAR the best car buying experience I've ever had! I live 300 miles away from this dealership... But I will return when it's time to buy another car!< /Text>

I agree with a comment that I was initially ignored when I showed up to the lot, but when I summoned Sam Oude out of the office, he unfolded the red carpet for me. I test drove the convertible Maserati I drove way out from South Bay to see within minutes. Approval for financing took minutes. They honored the online sticker price which was wrong. They waited a couple days for my check to clear and they delivered the car to my home. Quick and easy! Thanks Sam & Chris! 😁< /Review>

I went to look at a car and ended up driving it home.  Keefah was our sales man, not only did he give us a great price but NEVER pressured us to buy.  After i got home i notice there were no car mats, in one phone call the mats were ordered.  Not only did they take care of me before the purchase but after the purchase as well.  Everyone at the dealership were helpful and kind. I would highly recommend this dealership.<//Text>

< review>
I had the pleasure of meeting and having Kifah Khodr assist me with the purchase of my new MZB. Kifah was extremely pleasant, informative and professional. I just purchased my vehicle yesterday and I have already referred Kifah to my friend who is interested in purchasing a new luxury vehicle. I  live in Las Vegas. However it was well worth the trip to Los Angeles to get the exact vehicle that I wanted. And the excellent service that I received from Kifah. I highly recommend OC  Autohaus and Kifah. *****< /review>

<Text>Salesman (younger guy, not sure his name) literally refused to move two cars out of the way so we could test drive a Lexus GSF. 2 minutes of his time and he could have easily had our business. I asked him if quickly moving a car or two was worth a possible sale and he literally shrugged me off. I guess they lost a sale as my partner is ready to buy and is just trying to decide between the GSF and RCF. I'm guessing he probably didn't take us seriously because of how we look. Very unfortunate.</Text><pics>None< /pics><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

I've recently purchased a 2011 bmw 550i.(twin turbo beast). I have terrible credit (530). Kevin, Vincent, and Chris worked diligently past working hours talking to different banks. Honestly, I didn't think I had a real chance in actually being financed but somehow these guys found a way to help me. Not only that, they negotiated a lower interest rate, and provided me with purchase orders, letters, and statements so that I could show my personal credit union there was a bank willing to finance the car for me. Ultimately, I got an even better rate because of their help and willingness to provide all the documentation they did. I expected to be talked down into some lower grade vehicle, but 1) they didn't really have any lower grade vehicles, and 2) they didn't try to steer me away from my car. The car was in high demand and arranging the financing took a couple of weeks so I thought during the time there definitely could be someone who would offer a higher bid and purchase the car outright. Its important to note the same car with more mileage and a higher price had been sold just a couple of days after it was posted online while I was arranging the finances; so the car could have easily been sold to someone else. Regardless of who and how much more they offered for the car they demonstrated true loyalty to me by holding the car. Everyone here went above and beyond the call of dealer service as they waited past working hours so that I could pick up my car. They were understanding about my situation (that it was difficult for me to get out of work/worked late, and traveled from a long distance in traffic just to make it). They were upfront and honest about the car. I've never been as pleased as I am now having gone through the whole process with them. There was no bs like the games some dealers play. I've purchased at least 4 other cars in my lifetime and these guys are by far my favorite dealer. Great service. I appreciate everything they did to help me and my situation. I feel like they gave me a break - especially because I know I have bad credit. I am extremely happy w/ my new car and grateful for having found these guys. I don't think it would have been possible but its like they pulled a miracle. Anyways, I definitely recommend OC Autohaus to anyone in the market for a car. I look forward to seeing these guys next time I'm back in the market. Thanks guys.</text><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

I was planing to go to several different dealers to look for the car i wanted but O.C. Autohaus was my first stop. i was really not planing to buy there but........ After meeting with Kifah and the wonderful staff there i knew there was no reason to go anywhere else. Kifah explained all the pros and cons of the models i was considering and at that point i realized he was treating me more like family than a customer. The deal that he gave me was great. If i was to sell this car today i would make money.The care was in great shape (like new) and more than i expected. Kifah also included a very expensive back up camera at their cost among other extras. Financing there was at a super rate and among one of the lowest that i found. I would recommend O.C. Autohaus highly to anyone looking for a wonderful car.</text>

Terrible service regret buying my Bentley car here. Bought my car on December 26th flew in from Idaho to get the car. It's now March 17th and I still don't have the dmv paperwork from them. I haven't been able and still am not able to drive my own car due to they still haven't sent in the proper paperwork for me to register the car. They ignore my calls and still haven't called me back to follow up with the issues. I have to keep calling in 3x a week to get answers. Get told they will be calling me back the next day and they never do. I'm having to get my attorney involved at this point. I do not recommend getting a car thro them.< /Review>

Almost a perfect encounter.  They didn't have the class of suv we paid for, so they upgraded us without any questions or issues.  No hassle.  Travel to and from the rental spot was timely, no issues.  Drop off was a breeze.  Shuttle staff was overly helpful.  Better than expected service.<//review>

Best experience so far with a car rental company. Hertz is improving every year,  the whole process was smooth and painless. My rental was upgraded without extra charge. Absolutely I'll repeat doing business with this company again and recommendations to all people that I know.<//Text>

Fast service. Friendly staff. The vehicle check out and check in process was very easy and fast. Plus their was a free shuttle back to the airport. 5/5 would go here again on next visit< /Review>

<text>I am very disappointed with my pick up today at Hertz LAX location. I’ve reserved a vehicle nearly 2 months ago and pre-pay for it. When I’ve arrived at the pick up location, I found the stall number assigned to me is empty. Apparently someone else took the vehicle reserved for me. Now they do not have another vehicle in same make and model and what the desk agent only offered me is something from a lower class. I’ve got 2 shocks to deal with, first my anticipated which is gone and second I’ve been offered something from a class below. When I’ve asked for a second preference, the agent replied to me that the vehicle is from one class upper and I’ll have to pay $75/day more to get that (4 days rental period).
I known the same make and model is not guaranteed always and rental companies usually provide with a similar vehicle in same class. If they don’t have anything in same class for a customer then they provide something better than the class originally reserved. I’ve called 2 days prior to my pick and add a note requesting a specific make and model to pick up at L.A. airport Hertz location. A couple of hours before I arrive to the airport I’ve even received an email from Hertz giving me my vehicle stall# in their parking lot which specify what I’ve book and anticipated with vehicle make model, color and plate number. I’ve also been advised the day before by a Hertz customer care agent that they normally hold any vehicle for 24 hours to pick up. Reason why I’ve called again to update my flight information just so that they know if there’s a flight delay they still hold my vehicle because I really wanted that specific make and model.
After so much effort, I still couldn’t get a vehicle of my choice where I’ve almost gotten it. Still don’t understand the the piece how that be assigned same vehicle to two different people or how they late someone drive away with a vehicle they didn’t reserve!
I am going to seriously consider a different vendor next time. And this is coming from a gold member!</text>< user>

<Review>(Translated by Google) All right with the car, it was great and we had no problem at all unless the answering service (over the phone) is very weak. I called to know where it was to deliver the car at the airport and the attendant only repeated the address of the airport but that was already written on paper, so ... if you do not need them, the young man who delivered the car in the Santa Monica store was very nice.

(Original)
Tudo certo com o carro, foi ótimo e não tivemos problema algum a não ser que o serviço de atendimento (por telefone) é muito fraco. Liguei para saber onde era para entregar o carro no Aeroporto e a atendente só repetia o endereço do aeroporto mas isso já estava escrito no papel, enfim... se você não precisar deles, já o moço que entregou o carro na loja de Santa Monica foi bem simpático.<//Review>< Pictures>

(Translated by Google) We were all about perfect completion in a matter of minutes despite the great rush. Top shuttle service to the nearby airport jumpsuit for the car return but 45 minutes due to the crowd in front of the airport

<Rate>5<//Rate><review>Since a lot of highly rated and popular places for beef noodles close around 2pm, we decided to try this place out. We called 5 min before and the food was ready for pickup almost right away. We ordered the beef brisket noodle and pork ribs noodle. The noodles came with spinach, cilantro, an quail egg and some tasty peanuts. The soup and meat came in a separate soup container. The flavors of both soups are tasty taste! The meats are tender and full of flavor. The noodles are very chewy and delicious! Highly recommend!</review>< pics>

Some of the best noodles I've had in the Bay Area. Packed full of flavor and they're very generous with toppings. Highly recommend getting the tendon noodle soup and adding in wontons and pickled long beans.<//Text>

I personally did not like this that much, as the soup base had too much of a sour vinegary taste to it (did not get a spicy one either). The group I went with thoroughly enjoyed it however! So to each their own.< /review>

Their vermicelli is the best.  Go for the beef shank noodles and the pork intestines noodles.  Both are great!</Review>

Pig ear, cold cucumber, and tripe are all very tasty, although the tripe was definitely the best of the three. And the noodle soups, as noted, were nomnomnom.</text>< Pictures>

One of the most authentic noodle house in the bay area. Mind you that it is very hot and spicy. One of my favorite restaurants.< /Text>

<Review>Very different from the standard Chinese fare most people are accustomed to. Some very spicy options! Wish more menu items were in English. If fried rice and sweet sour pork is as exotic as you get, you may not like this food. Edit: quality seems to have gone downhill.<//Review>< Pics>

<Review>finally a legit Chinese restaurant near my house! it reminds me of QQ noodle in Cupertino. we ordered the non-spicy stewed beef brisket soup for the kids and they love it. the soup is pretty good considering they don't use MSG (has hint of sour). the spicy and sour pork intestine rice noodle soup and pickle steam beef stir fry rice noodle are pretty good too. I just wishes there are more meat in all their dishes. the crispy dumplings are expensive for the portion. you taste too much of the skin & too little fillings. sauce is good though. will try the pickled string beans with ground pork rice noodle next time. the fried Chinese bread looks good too (hope it's served with condensed milk)<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None</response><Gmap_id>0x808e345b0dd66d3f:0x234bf58eadb6fea8< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

The food here is really delicious! The spicy soups are in fact quite spicy. Don't expect good customer service though, they act as if you're inconveniencing them by coming in to order.</text>

The rice beef strew noodles and the stock (No MSG) takes ok, nothing special at all. I also tried the stir fry seafood rice noodles and it was salty.  Wouldn't come back here anymore. There are much better chinese noodles restaurants in the area.< /review>

Tip: A surprisingly authentic Chinese noodle shop that specializes in the sour soup noodles of Xiang and Hunan.  The small size is more than filling but the large includes both more noodles and broth.  Credit cards accepted.<//review>

Ordered the Beef Stew and egg rolls to go. Beef stew came out hot and delicious. Crunchy veggies and soft and flavorful beef. Egg rolls are crunchy and soft on the inside. Couldn’t not be more happy. Paid $11 and some change. Will come here again!<//text>

<Review>Not sure what is going on with the food. I've been going to this place since i was in high school. Went a week ago and it was a complete "TURN OFF". It's very sad to see this place change, since it was one of the best Pho place's in the North.. So, is there new owner's or what.?</Review>< pictures>

I found this place by fluke about a few weeks almost about a month ago and ever since then myself and my family, have been going there! They are so wonderful! I really love the fact that they're so authentic and they are very personable! I love them and I would recommend them to a lot of people!< /review>

The Lao style papaya salad is the best in town. I have been there three times within two months just for the papaya salad, but I don't like the customer service. The same lady who takes the order at the counter and brings the food out, has a perpetual frown. She takes my order without looking at me. When I ask for information on a certain dish, she answers as she is busy writing. When she brings the food out, she is so stoic. I really like the food here, but I don't like the cold customer service.</text>

Cooked Labp? Is awesome, and papaya salad also very good. Drive 1/2 hr just for it.
Service?.. usually order to go so I have no problems. Dined in once, nothing bad nothing special, so it was good.
Ambience? Ummm... none :) but your there to eat and look at the food not stare at the walls.< /Review>

I absolutely  love this place..super nice people that work there..you can tell it's family operated which is super nice..the food and quality and freshness is a major plus ..the noodles are so fresh and you can tell there  hand made..not all chewy  and mushy like a lot I've had..ive been coming here for 5years and never once have I been distapointed .. I love dinning in with  fam or friends .. l love south east Asian bbq
Now let me get back to my pho and  sticky rice..

Asian friends took me here.
Bland Laos food. The Pho is not good. They skimp on so many ingredients that would make it authentic. The pho has minced cilantro, 1 strip of paper thin beef flank and 2 meatballs and broth. Thats it.....Really?
The food is stripped of its bountiful Real flavors..maybe to reduce cost....which is disappointing. The female behind the register in her late 30's is snobby and impatient. She rearranges her facial emotions so obvious! Id rather use $5 in gas to experience real Laos food in South Sacramento. The interior paint- choice of color is unappealing..nauseating.</text>

< Review>
Have had the pleasure of using Storage West in Oceanside two times.  Both times, the management was orderly, helpful, and consistent.  David is the best.  The place is immaculate.  Would highly recommend this storage to friends and family if they needed it.</Review>

Very clean and secure place. David was very nice and knowledgeable. Brooke was helpful too. It was my first time needing storage and they both made it easy for my wife and I.< /Review>

I worked with David at Storage West Oceanside to set up a large storage unit for when my husband deployed. He was so great to work with, made everything super easy, especially since we did everything over the phone due to COVID-19.

We had a last minute change in plans and didn’t end up using the storage unit at all, and they gave us a full refund. I will definitely go to them if we ever need storage in Oceanside again and would recommend them to anyone in the area!</text>

David the full time manager at the above address is a   10 star employee....I have had two lockers with Storage West. David helped & supported me on at least 3 occasions when abnormal occurrences  occured. He helped me immediately in each case, was kind, efficient & professional. All help has been good at this site while I had property here. If I ever need storage again I will not hesitate to use Storage West.< /text>

The on-site managers Jake and Jennifer provided nothing but exceptional customer service. Communication was always quick via email, and if they were away from the office I always got a call back promptly. For the same price of some smaller units at other locations, Storage West offered bigger storage options. I have nothing but good things to say about our experience with them and if i needed more storage in the future I would definitely go through them again. Thank you!</Text>

Nice people. Yelp is full of it, this is the only
smoke shop to go to in the downtown area. Not only is it locally owned and operated, they aren’t afraid to be themselves. Turn some indie, reggae, or electronic music on sometime boys! Doesn’t need to be yoyoyo every time does it? 😝</Text>

<text>So who doesn't like a smoke shop... seems there's not many and only people who don't frequent them know the difference between a smoke shop and a head shop. These guys go above and beyon, and  if they asked me if there is anything they could do to improve their service or inventory I would say no and then I would say yeah wait a minute... how about vinyl and how about a turntable now about some Bose speakers... that's what I would say. I hope they asked me and I hope I remember my suggestion. Oh yeah and maybe a Ms Pac-Man machine!<//text>< UserId.>

Not a bad little smoke shop, they are stocked up with almost everything you could possibly need in regards to having a puff. I haven't been here lately, the last few times I went the wait was too long.  There's usually only one staff member working and it seems like everybody has no clue what they're looking for So it takes the clerk Time to guide and help them.  I'm sure they appreciate it but it does nothing for me since I'm the one waiting.</Text>

<Review>Good selection of products, and clever enough they have an unorthodox couch you can sit on to view all the pieces instead of having to crouch. Prices are pretty fair, walked out with a dope bubbler for only $35.

Can't remember the dudes name but good customer service like he enjoys being there and made us feel welcome.<//Review><username>Andrew</username></record></dataset><record>

They have a great selection and very knowledgeable staff. They also have a few sister locations, so if they didn't have exactly what you wanted at this store, they may have it at another one of the Smokeez shops. But this one is very good. Pleasant atmosphere, no pressure.<//text>

Love this place definitely has alot of cool glassware art abd a large selection to choose from etc.. the staff is chill fast friendly customer service can't find much wrong to say about this place at all  but I will say this as my own opinion but sometimes after looking at the sticker price it can definitely kill the moment in wanting to get it .<//Text>

Great bargain prices on Pink Spot juice, prices are all around a little lower then average (in a good way). They got tons of pieces, vape gear, shisha and hookahs, and the usual head shop stuff (whippits, Salvia, ect) Only complaint was I didn't see any synthetic urine or drug test kits. I didn't see any kratom either. Service was chill, all in all great smoke shop.<//review>

This place is cool but if you are a repeat customer they don't care. I bought a 80 piece on friday called back this friday to get something that sells for about 175 everywhere else. I asked if I could get a local deal or a cash deal. They said without the deal its 183 ok with the local 10% deal 162. I'm like ya!! and then the guy goes it will be $186 with tax.. lol try another place before you use them. They suck</Text>

<text>We had a nice family dinner here. My parents and my brother enjoy the taste of their food. The carbonara was made in an authentic Italian manner. Food and drinks were coming out fast. The place was so spacious, and it has a lovely setting. The staffs were so helpful and kind to us. We had a nice time in this restaurant.< /text>< pics>

<time>1593484510916<//time><Rating>1<//Rating><Text>I am not sure if this is how Domino's operates in this location, but my short experience that I had at this Domino's Pizza was very unpleasant. I asked for an extra pizza box with my pizza because I was working with a group of workers, and with concern of COVID-19, I wanted to eat separately with them to reduce the possibilities of getting infected. However, the cashier refused to give me an extra box and we had a slight quibble because of it. Eventually, I decided to make a refund because I was totally unsatisfied and humiliated by the attitude of the cashier. I asked for a receipt, and she gave me one that says *BAD ORDER* and just an order number on the receipt. This is the first time I saw a receipt like this, so I questioned her if this was the right receipt that she was supposed to give me. She started shouting and as soon as I tried to leave evidence and take footage of her behavior, she started to do the same thing in a threatening pose. This was the worst kind of service I had in years in a restaurant and I highly recommend other customers to be aware of this type of situation happening again in the future. The cashier should have been way more calm in approaching to explain the situation to the confused customer.<//Text>< Pictures>

Do not! I MEAN DO NOT! order at Domino's Pizza I went there earlier this month and saw something disgusting in the kitchen at Dominos. Don't ask how I got into the kitchen of this HORRIBLE place, but i did. What I saw disgusted me so much I threw up on the floor.
I saw... I saw....I saw......HUMAN FECES! Right on my 14 inch extra pepperoni and extremely cheesy pizza with olives for 19 dollars and 99 cents. I mean how outrageous is that 20 bucks for a pizza might as well give them my grandmothers ashes from 1997 (I tell you my grandmother's ashes are in mint condition and she is a rare classic from the 90's). But then I remembered that POO is

<review>They always get my order wrong a lot of people in my household don’t eat meat and they put pepperoni on it all the time! It’s not that hard to take an order to constantly make the same mistakes. When I call back the phone is busy also.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

Even the waiter greeted us respectfully and nicely. As we ordered, he was very entertaining and nice. Besides, the pizza that I ordered taste delicious, crust, and the methods of cooking were quite impressive. Thanks!</review>< pictures>

Quick fast food. Cheap pizzas. Fast online service. But the pizzas and wings are too salty & over-seasoned. You get what you pay for.<//Text>

For a long time this place was really hit or miss, sometimes the service was ok and other times it was downright terrible. However over the past couple of months this place has really upped their game and the service is consistently pretty good. The food is never a problem its pretty consistent as what you would expect from Domino's, which is all you can ask for quality wise. Hopefully they will continue with the improved service there and that would make them a 5 star location.</text>

Really nice to find a pizza place that is open LATE and delivers! Also that they have a variety of sizes and options! The pizza and cheese sticks I ordered were good and they even called me before delivering to make sure everything on my order was correct.  Food arrived early and tasted great! I definitely recommend this spot and will be ordering from here again!<//text>

The pizza here is some of the best I've had in the San Fernando Valley. The ingredients are excellent. My usual go to is the Truffle pizza - simple, yet delicious. I liked the way the ordering process was before, where you would order as you go down the line where all the ingredients are. Because this is simply not the process anymore, that's why I deducted a star. The service also used to be slightly better, and not sure exactly why but my pizzas the last couple times have been burnt. I'm not sure if it was just left too long in the oven or what the issue was, but the flavors were there. Despite these small issues, I highly recommend this place !</review>

You can occasionally bump into the owner Jesse, he'll check up on tables and is always so pleasant to talk to! A really down to earth and humble guy! Amazing atmosphere relaxing when it's not too busy but fun and chill when it is busy. The pizza is so delicious and you can taste the quality in the ingredients and produce used. The dough is seriously out of this world  one of my favorite places to go to for any occasion period.<//Text>< pictures>

Wonderful! The manager is on the money here. The one thing I really like is the ask to see the card that you charged with if you buy the pizza online. With all the crime that's going on downtown it's nice to see that a company cares about its customers. I can never leave after picking up my pizza before sitting down on one of the tables having a couple slices then I walk to my home which is very close.

<Text>This place is good. We were staying at the Marriott Newport Coast Villas and had them deliver. Really good pizza. If you like Los Angeles style pizza you'll like this. We also got the garlic knots and they were just ok. But the pizza was very good. Customer service was outstanding! I would definitely recommend this place.</Text><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None< /Resp><gmap_id>0x80c2c7b4c1a0a739:0x47e5ead9ffcdbc83< /gmap_id><Rate>4< /Rate><user_name>Ashlea Engles</user_name><time>1561453560363< /time><userid>102258155097139845905< /userid></record></dataset><record>

I am in town for a SPECIAL event. Since I don't know my way around town. I decided to stick with familiar 😂 Domino's never lets me down. And the $5.99 mix and match is an awesome deal👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗<//Review>

<review>I love Domino's, I have the app so every time that I want pizza I order in there and at the moment that I arrive they already have it done for me, they are so fast!! The flavor is nice and they have a lot of specials in the app :) most of the times the large pizza is around 9-14 dollars :) :)< /review>< pictures>

<Review>Order never showed up, after 2 hours of quality check I called, they said they didn’t have the drivers to deliver... should be able to give delays before ordering, if backed up, let people know, not leave them hanging... also upon calling, they stated another 45 minutes or so... half of a Netflix series is way too long to just sit around for a pizza with no notifications of delay.  Would not use.</Review>< Date>

<Rating>1< /Rating><review>I placed an order online an hour before these guys closed. I share an account with my parents, so they tried calling the wrong cellphone number. When I tried calling them back (5 times) they would not answer the phone and the line kept hanging up on me.
So I never got my pizza and no one ever got ahold of me to tell me why I didn’t get my pizza. After a long 12 hour day of working I was very disappointed. And I understand it was late at night, but I ordered an hour before the store closed, not 5 minutes before they closed. Very disappointed.< /review><pics>None< /pics>< Date>

Called this location to place an order. Order 2 pizzas and sent a family member to pick this up. When he returned he had 2 boxes of wings, one PEPPERONI and one SAUSAGE pizza. The group does not eat pork due to religious reasons. We called them to make them aware of the wrong order the associate, Jessica argued that this was the order because she took the order. Amazing that people who do not eat pork would accidentally order 2 pork pizzas. Jessica went on to say that she was the manager and hung up. After calling back the "manager" claims to the mistake on our end for ordering the wrong pizza. I cannot believe they argued food which we couldn't not eat and wanted to return. They offer no resolution until we arrived. Absolutely unacceptable!!<//review>

<Review>Came here and everything was good, one thing I didn't realize was that the carne asada pizza isn't with carne asada but their brisket meat instead, it was delicious though. I got the habanero wings and they were really spicy which I liked.

Overall: Their brisket is delicious and their pizza and wings are worth trying.</Review><rate>4< /rate><pics>None<//pics></record>

And the time the pizza delivery guy came to me
It is 1:50 pm.

I did not receive the order.
I asked why I was so late
The delivery guy told me.
We told them our delivery time was two hours.

I have not seen anywhere on the website that it takes two hours and I have not received any contact.

I was a frequent shopper
The distance was one block and they came to me in 1 hour and 20 minutes.

You will have to explain to me.
There was no explanation that it took 2 hours anywhere, and the delivery guy told me that our delivery time was 2 hours
I spoke without courtesy.<//Review>< Pics>

<text>I actually really like Domino's and this location is fine, though I might only think this because I was pretty drunk when I got food here. It also weirded me out how much my farts smelled exactly like the pizza I ate. Like, exactly.< /text><name>Stebs< /name>< pictures>

<review>I have been ordering from this location for 2+ years. No issues until tonight. I was unable to make an order online more than an hour before closing and when I called they said my card didn’t work.

I've placed an order in the store for a large Hawaii pizza. Waited 30 minutes and I've seen that it was ready on the screen. I've asked what the status was, and got an angry employee shouting; "When it is ready we will shout your name.". 15 minutes later still no pizza. Asking again what the status was, it was in the heater for 15 minutes already, ready to be picked-up. When I asked for a reason, she said; "I don't know and walked off". Worse staff in any dominos on the entire world. Not polite and definitely not working on customer service.

Never returning here.< /text>

I ordered online and then they cancelled the after 1 1/2 hour without calling even though the tracker said it was on the way. This was only 11 at night. This is the second time they did this. There wont be a third. Screw this location.< /Review>

Literally the worst Dominos location. First,  I ordered a pizza. Waited an hour. Nothing. Called.  The employee lied and said they couldn't get in the building -- despite having a 24/7 doorman. I spoke to a manager, then she said something about the bike delivery man was concerned about getting rain in the building -- called me ( they didn't) I didn't answer and my order was cancelled.

Fast forward to today, about a week later, after placing an order at 12:28pm, i just got a phone call at 2pm saying that they're just starting my order and that it'll be here in ANOTHER HOUR.

DO NOT ORDER DELIVERY FROM THIS LOCATION.</review>

Literally can't order because every time I try, I get redirected to your business site. Click the link to order online, redirected to business site with no ability to order. Whoever is managing the Dominos website is costing you a huge amount of lost revenue.<//review>

I ordered the pizza on line and it took over an hour to get here after it left the store.(that is not including the time it took to cook). the boxes were damaged, the pizza was cold. And when I called the store to ask about were my pizza was the girl told me there was one delivery ahead of mine. Which wouldn't make sense since I live less than a half a mile from the store. So 30 min would make sense, not an hour. I told the person on the phone this and she hung up on me. This is horrible customer service, and it will make me second guess ordering from here ever again.< /Review>

I order my pizza from this location all the time. Today I ate two slices then went in for another slice while eating my third slice I noticed something hanging I thought it was cheese I pulled on it and immediately noticed it was hair and the hair wasn’t Just on top it was COOKED INTO MY PIZZA! So I called to let them know the girl that answered the phone Jazzet I started to tell her what happen she asked me to bring the pizza back so they could have a look at it and I told her that I don’t have a car and that I wasn’t able to then she said well you ordered a hour ago it took you a hour to find a piece of hair and I started to tell her my kids ate first then I sat down to eat but couldn’t get that out because she hung up in my face I immediately called back I was very upset nobody answered so my boyfriend called from his phone and immediately asked to speak to a manager the guy that answered said he was the manager his name was Alejandro he was no better because he didn’t even offer an apology he just they he’ll give me another pizza or give me credit for a new one I told him I don’t want another pizza I don’t want anything from them because I don’t even trust it I asked for a refund and he said hegave me the refund but didnt even sound like he cared about the situation I’ll be waiting to see my refund hopefully or I’ll be calling back again .... this place has horrible customer service and the girl that hung up the phone should loose her job maybe she’ll think about how she treats customers then if she’s taught that lesson don’t order here at this location there horrible</Review>

I don't know why they have such an issue cutting the thin crust pizza in squares.  I ordered online and specifically choose the special instructions to cut into squares.. when I arrived I told them again to cut into squares.. when I got the carry out.. sure enough it was NOT cut into sqaures.. not only was it not in squares they forgot the onions I paid extra for.  They screw up the cut into squares all the time.  And first time they forgot an item..</Text>

Items frequently come with missing toppings. Just ordered an item and delivery driver refused to deliver pizza. Manager was unhelpful and rude as well. This was the last straw, not that it will probably matter, but I will never order from this store again. A number of these 5 star reviews can't be real, or they've had a very different experience than I have with this location.<//Review>

<username>Suzuki Chi<//username><Text>Ordered two pizzas for delivery at 9:10 pm, the tracker said it was ready at 9:45. I called in about 10:20 because there were no more updates. The person working said the pizzas were the next to go, insisted the tracker was unreliable and both pizzas would still be hot. When I got the pizza, at 11pm, two hours after ordering, both were room temperature at best. One was also made incorrectly. The employees didn't mark the delivery as complete so I can't leave feedback there. Two delivery men were at the hotel lobby when I was called down to pick it up. Obviously poor optimization of workers. The delivery man I was not taking my pizza from was actually pleasant and he brought hot pizza directly to peoples rooms.</Text><resp>None</resp><rating>1< /rating><UserId.>116748142148648478825<//UserId.><Time>1499149704187</Time><Gmap_id>0x80c2c7b4c1a0a739:0x47e5ead9ffcdbc83<//Gmap_id><pictures>None<//pictures></record>

Sadly, one of our attorney's is leaving, so we decided to order pizza for his party. I placed an order at 9:00 am for delivery at 11:45 to 444 South Flower (financial district of DTLA). I then called back twice after 10:00 am to add additional items. Not only was my order on time, the young man who delivered it (I wish I knew his name) brought our pizza to the 20th floor! Considering he came on a bike with 10 pizzas, 2 cookies, 4 boxes of chicken and 2 boxes of bread/stuffed bread, he was extremely polite, friendly and funny.

We will definitely be placing another order with this branch. Thanks Domino's for making our going away party a success.</text>

<review>This place is a joke. Ordered online at 1:00pm, it's 1:43pm I've been on hold for 15 minutes so I can check on my order! my online order tracker has been on "We're Firing It Up" since 1:02pm! How busy could you really be on a Friday at 1:30pm?

I'd just hit a local pizza place if I was you, wasted my lunch break on these guys. Awesome.

UPDATE: it's 2:19pm and the "Prefection Check" is being completed. Took about 30 minutes LMFAOO< /review>< Pictures>

Delivery always brings it all the way up to our apartment and visited the store today for my piece of the pie rewards- sooo much cleaner than any other pizza place around by far! I actually enjoyed watching their assembly line in action- they’re busy but very efficient. I’ve also pre-planned for parties with them and everything was super smooth. Best dominos I’ve seen yet! Also they do vegan and gluten free... wuuut.< /text>

I order from here regularly.  The only criticism I have is that even though I always ask for light sauce, more often than not the pizza arrives with regular or even extra sauce.  I don’t understand it...< /Text>

I go here a lot.  The thin crust pizza is what I always order, and it's always made well.  However, starts deducted for service reasons. twice I've ordered a thin crust and they made it regular crust.  I have to double check it before I leave now.  Walked in on a Saturday night at 10:30, sign posted and hours online said they were open until 1am. I was told they were closed and they wouldn't serve me.  I was pissed at having wasted a drive AND not getting any pizza.  You need to update your takeout hours online if you're closing earlier than you say!</text>

<review>worst dominos, always get order wrong, omit toppings, etc, then pizza is delivered upside down or as if it was tossed around like a fedex package, then mgr has audacity to attribute it to bumpy rides.  better to buy frozen digornios. lost a longtime customer with this repeated bullsh1t.< /review>< Pictures>

This place has rude employees. I ordered a pizza and it doesn't come for an hour and a half. I call to asked them where it was and they said they cancelled it. Also the person who answered the phone was very rude.<//Review>

(Translated by Google) Very good place to eat. The problem is that it takes around 15 minutes for each order, so it is not a good option for a quick purchase.
But the people who attend are very good and have a letter in Spanish, which helps a lot.
In addition, the wide opening hours are good, which is very good for when you have to eat late

(Original)
Muy buen lugar para comer. El problema es que tardan alrededor de 15 minutos en cada pedido, por lo que no es una buena opción para una compra rápida.
Pero la gente que atiende es muy buena y tiene una carta en español, lo cual ayuda y mucho.
Además es bueno el horario de atención tan amplio, con lo cual es muy bueno para cuando tienes que cenar tarde< /Text>

(Translated by Google) I've never had such bad pizza. I ordered a buffalo mozzarella with chicken and had only pepper. So much pepper that when I bit the first piece, I could not swallow. I kept my mouth burning for a long time and had to leave the hotel in search of something to snack on. One could never imagine that a pizza with buffalo mozzarella, supposedly healthier, could have so much pepper. Warning: When ordering pizza at this location in Los Angeles, order NO SPICY, NO PEPPER and everything else that is possible, otherwise you will eat a pepper pizza.

(Original)
Eu nunca comi uma pizza tão ruim. Pedi uma de mussarela de búfala com frango e só tinha pimenta. Tanta pimenta que ao morder o primeiro pedaço, não consegui engolir. Fiquei com a boca ardendo por bastante tempo e tive que sair do hotel em busca de algo para lanchar. Nunca poderia imaginar que uma pizza com mussarela de búfala, supostamente mais saudável, poderia ter tanta pimenta. Aviso: ao pedir pizza neste local em Los Angeles, peçam NO SPICY, NO PEPPER e tudo mais que for possível, caso contrário comerá uma pizza de pimenta.< /Text>

<review>(Translated by Google) Highly recommended, they serve you very kindly and the prices are normal. The pizzas make them relatively fast according to the people there are and you can see how they make them. The only downside is that there is very little space to eat there, barely 3 tables and a small bar

<Review>(Translated by Google) A small place but with good attention and fast, very rich and with a variety of flavors, textures and sizes, which complements fried chicken, soft drinks, hamburgers and sandwiches. In a commercial, recreational area where you can complement your purchase and carry out other activities, you have a parking space which facilitates your purchase, there is also at home.
