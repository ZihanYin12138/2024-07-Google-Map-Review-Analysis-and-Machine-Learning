Great experience. They quoted me a price on the phone, came and picked up the vehicle, got the title, gave me a receipt, and paid me in cash. Effortless!<//Text>

I thought they paid ok considering how junky my car was. The mechanic told me they would have paid over twice that if i knew how to bargain. They came quickly and on time but...there is a second company that does business under their name and they scheduled twice with me and were late twice. If you want to deap with the the company called ecology that was on time, make sure the guy on the phone is Persian</text>

<Rating>5</Rating><Review>I called a lot of cash for car places and Ecology cash for cars paid me the most and was definitely the most pleasant to work with. I called in and the staff was very friendly and knowledgeable and were able to get me a price very quickly on the phone. They did not pressure me or call me repeatedly like some of the other companies I had called. Once I let them know i was ready to sell the car they came out very quickly and worked around my schedule to pickup up my car. My car had a bad transmission and they towed it away for me at no extra cost. I had a great experience.<//Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPUwIC82gchhBXDa_ylhyiCuFpdkmDjgLaaMtLm=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMMuwHpack4OvEwwA3KRZqGDt7azbQusZNMsM80=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMnfzERGgatylxIvcWcnzYYsconbRrb8EV940rT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPz9JreLq8qNcAb3r9DB0QWdtWPjizMb2ADspeF=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPMq_yaUYg5uYzUQh3ul0lI1INsGiM5pEzWxyMr=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics><Resp>{'time': 1528077683110, 'text': "Thanks Mason!

I just called for what I thought would be a professional appraisal for my 2012 GMC Terrain, not a scratch outside, no mechanical issues, 4 cylinder, with less than 95000 miles on it. The only bad about it is that we don't have the replacement tire. The guy on the phone has the audacity to say: "give me a moment while I calculate the price"... what kind of drug he used to say $2000 dollars? I don't know. Even dealers that were trying to rob me offered me double than that. A total waste of time. Just keep away from this "business" if you want a fair price for what you have.<//text>

Parents just received a $900 ticket for speeding off the hwy 8 heading east bound in the mail. My father asked me to find a place to sell off a car for some cash rather then to post it online and go through the trouble of selling it him self. Now he gets a $900 ticket in the mail for speeding on hwy 8. When I selected this company I kept in mind that on their website it said they handled all dmv paperwork, seems like they didn’t do it. We have cameras on our drive way and good things everything was recorded to use as evidence to fight this. I wouldn’t recommend this establishment to anyone your better off selling it your self. Ecology cash for cars suscks!<//text>

Not a very good experience.  Did the online get a quote.  Gave all the details of my vehicle including uploading of photos of the exterior and interior.  Clean title, they had all the info to give a fair quote.  What do I get?

The next morning I received a text asking if the car is still available?  Uh? yeah I asked for a quote it means I'm asking for a quote right?  Then asked if they could call me, sure no problem.  The person who called clearly had never even bothered to look at the details given in the online request a quote including the uploaded pictures(this becomes important later).  I proceeded to give all the details about the vehicle I already gave them; without even thinking about the information I just gave him or even look at the photos... snap offered a lowball price $175.

I was dumbfounded.  I told him another service offered me $200 without knowing anything about the vehicle as is.  He said he would check with his "boss"; never got a call back.

With rest of the day with no call back, I decided to call them back at their main number to see if that experience would be any better... NOPE!

I told them about my experience with the gentleman that called earlier in the morning.  This guy proceeds to give me the same lowball price, and again still never looked at the uploaded photos.  I asked him what exactly is the point of giving copious details along with photos in the online form if they're not even used to formulate a "fair" quote?!?!

Of course this is when the I get the we're a poor business; we don't really make any money on these vehicles 'woe-is-me' story telling.  I also mentioned the $200 offer from another service, NOPE wouldn't budge even $25.

Soup to nuts a sad state of affairs over a Ecology Cash For Cars; I cannot with any good conscious recommenced this service for a fair review of your vehicle or price.< /text>

I would recommend this place to anyone with a junk car. I called them about my junk car and they were really nice and helpful. I really do not know much about cars and I did not know what kind of vehicle I had. They were able to help me figure out the year make and model of my vehicle. Then they got me a great price on the vehicle, showed me how to do the paperwork, and towed the vehicle away. This is a very fast and easy service.</review>

< Review>
I had a non running car that was too expensive for me to fix. I had over heated the engine on the freeway and had no idea what to do with the car. I found Ecology cash for cars and  they were very helpful and made everything really easy. They give you an option to either have the vehicle picked up or delivered to there yard in Otay Mesa. Since my vehicle was broken down on the freeway I towed it directly to them and got paid on the spot.< /Review>

< review>
My car had broken down I could not believe my luck. I was in a very rough situation and I needed to sell my car which was pretty much junk because the damage was bad the head gasket went and the repairs would have been tough. I did not have the cash or funds to even attempt a repair like that.

I ended up calling the Ecology in San Diego to get an appraisal on how much cash I could get for it. I wasn't expecting much but to my great surprise they offered me more than expected. And they even told me they could come and tow it for me. It was truly a great customer experience that I can only say thanks for the help and the cash. Having your car break down isn't fun but having someone like Ecology Cash For Cars to help you is a life saver.< /review>

Not only did they pay me for my car, they met me at the tow yard and picked it up.<//text></record>

My mechanic kept calling me because I left my car that was too expensive to fix at his shop and he was going to start charging me storage . The car was junk and i had no idea what to do with it. I Gave these guys and call and they came and picked up the car from the mechanic shop. They were very fast and came out and payed me and did the paper work. I will call you again with my next car.</Text>

Fair Price, Excellent Service, very quick.

Had a charging port replaced on my iPhone.  Took less than an hour.  Was an issue with the camera afterwards, they took care of it immediately at no cost with no questions asked.

Highly recommend this business for phone repairs.<//text>

Broken iphone x
Was going to go to apple  they said 300, minimum then back up your phone and "we switch it out"...so
Had it repaired at a place for 290, the screen didn't even hold, so crawled back to apple, and they said 300 but after looking at it they refused to touch it. And tried to sell me new iphone.

I went here they completely fix my phone for 130!!!! Thank you!!!

It just goes to show you these big corporate companies are money hungry, thiefs.< /Text><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmap_id>

<Review>I dropped my iPhone when I hurriedly grabbed it from a table to check a text message.  When I looked at my phone, the right half of the LCD display was fuzzy.  Then, the right half went completely black.  I couldn't believe this was happening to me.  I did not have insurance for the phone.  I had recently made an expensive purchase of a different item and needed to start saving money.  Fortunately, the lady at T-Mobile was honest and did not try to sell me a new phone for $400 - $500.  Instead she referred me to Cell Spot Cell Phone Repair which is across the street from T-Mobile.  My phone was fixed in less than an hour.  The price to fix the phone was $70.  It was such a huge relief.  While I was there, a customer who arrived before me expressed the same relief that I was experiencing.  I am very grateful and fortunate that this service was available and so close.</Review>< Pics>

<review>My Samsung Galaxy S10 wouldn't charge using the USB port due to water damage that happened last year. CellSpot fixed it at a fair price. Other shops wanted triple as much because they said I needed new parts. CellSpot cleaned up the USB port and resoldered it, and I got it back the next day.  It works great now.</review>< Pics>

They fixed my phone once. It was easier to break badly and quickly than original. Understandable. They discount 15% when the back of my iPhone 8 was broken again after a month. This time, was really bad with a big hole that I never seen before (not sure they used high quality materials first time fixing it) Now there is weird dirt on the front when I received my phone back. I didn’t see this when I brought my phone to them.
I wouldn’t say bad service but in terms of quality I can’t give them 5 stars because of the weird spots now.<//review>

They have fair prices, it's hard to find the store if your familiar with the area I got lost bad trying to get there and I'm good at finding places. They worked with me to stay open Bc I was late due to being lost. They repaired my phone fast but then the home button wasn't working and they didn't have another one so told me to come back when I had one and pushed me out the door. They should have taken responsibility and ordered the part(which costs literally $.50) for me and replaced for free.< /review>

My son dropped his new iPhone 5c and AT&T wanted $365 to replace the screen.  We decided to take the phone to Cells pot after reading so many good reviews. For less than a 1/3 the price and 20 minutes later we had a brand new screen. Shawn helped us and provided excellent service.  Thanks so much.< /review>

<Text>I'm happy I found this place online and read the reviews because everyone who said they give great service is absolutely right. He said he could fix my cracked screen that same day and after we dropped it off he called me right back and said it would have to be tomorrow because he was missing the right material which was disappointing but I appreciate his honesty and how quickly he got back to me. In fact, he even made it up to me and threw in my choice of a protective case free of charge so he even went above and beyond. That was 2 years ago and I'm still using the same case and I've never had a screen problem since. Money well spent.<//Text>< Name>

Shawn recommended a protective screen as well for my Galaxy S3. They get a thumbs up from me. If you want fast service, great prices and great customer service. This is the place to go. Thanks so much Shawn. :-D</Review>< Pictures>

Sean helped me out & went above & beyond to deliver SUPERB service! I hardly ever write reviews but after coming back 3x service just got better & better!! I'd recommend cell spot to anyone & would choose these guys any day over a typical device provider that treats you like a number. Goodbye cracked screens:)</Review>

<review>TL;DR: Yup, all the reviews are true. Service is QUICK. Discount if you work for T-Mobile!

The guy kept great communication with me and most importantly, was honest. He explained that my battery life wasn't great on my Galaxy S6, and told me I would most likely to replace the battery. He told me to try it out for a few days and if I wanted to replace it to come back.</review>< Pics>

Quick and easy no hassle.  Called up cell spot, explained my iPhone issue.  They gave me a quote over the phone and said it would take 5 minutes to repair.  Came to the store and Sean got my phone repaired in less than 5 minutes!!! Good day turned into a better day! 3 thumbs up!!!</Text>

I came into cell spot phone repair to fix a phone that i wasn't sure was even salvageable. the customer service was great, Shawn helped me out in fixing my phone in 15 minutes! he fixed the button for free, gave me a deal on the screen and labor, put on a free phone case on as well as a free glass screen protector!! the service was generous and helped me save a lot of money. i highly recommend coming here to fix your phone, you cannot find anywhere better!! ask for Shawn to help you out, he was great!<//Text>

<text>Been putting off getting the girlfriend's cracked Galaxy S4 screen for too long. After reading the reviews for Cell Spot this seemed like the go to spot. Sean was able to get it fixed and looking like brand new in less than two hours. Awesome service and very accommodating.

<review>My fiance cracked his phone screen so the first thing we did was go to Apple but they charge quite a bit to fix it plus they said we have to mail it in and go without a phone for a few days. After doing some research we went to Cell Spot. He was able to get the screen fixed the same day for a great price! This was perfect since we were only in the area that day. It's also good to know that they sell phone cases and insurance for those of you who consistently break your phones. We will go back again if we break a phone!<//review><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

<review>Shawn and Eliseo are amazing! What a relief. I broke my LCD screen and thought I had to buy a new phone then when I called them they told me they could fix and and gave me a really good price. I even called another place and it was a ridiculous price. Not only is there price the best around but they were so nice and that's how I decide if I will come back to a place. I will definitely be coming back here, they are very honest.< /review><Rate>5<//Rate>< gmap_id>

Keeping it at 5 stars, within 24 hours my first repaired screen was cracked. I took it back and the warranty doesn't cover cracks even though you could see that there wasn't an impact mark. They offered to get me a higher quality screen and only charge for the part, no labor or profit.

After getting my nexus 6 back for a second time, it's been doing well so far and I could tell this was a better screen. It's thinner and the area around the speakers is much thinner, like it was originally. The first screen had bigger gaps and my top speaker kinda wiggled... So in the end, I spent more but do feel like I got a better screen and treated fairly.

Original review: So fast! Did a marvelous job replacing my Motorola nexus 6.< /text>

<Review>I was having a rough day. I was under a lot of stress and going to fix my cracked iPhone screen was not how I wanted to spend my morning, but from the moment I opened the door- James was extremely pleasant and helpful. He completely cheered me up within my short 20 minute wait. The prices were low and I highly recommend visiting James if you have a cracked iPhone screen, or if you just need to be cheered up. Haha!

Shawn did an awesome job repairing my two phones. The screens were cracked and he was able to repair them very quickly for a great price. I highly recommend Cellspot!</Review>

I took two separate cell phones to this repair shop.  Both phones had to be taken back because they were not fixed correctly the first time.
One of the phones had a cracked screen, other than that it worked fine.  When I got it back, the screen no longer worked and it cost me an additional $100 to repair.  Total cost of $200.<//Text>

I came in today to get my horribly cracked iPhone 5s screen repaired - it only took 20 minutes and I got my phone back looking brand new. For $89 which is cheaper than most places. Shawn helped me and was very friendly - excellent customer service. Highly recommend this place!<//Text>

<Text>Terrible customer service. The screen on my samsumg S7 edge broke.

Saturday 7/8: I took the phone in for repair. They said they did not have the part and to return on Monday.

Monday 7/10: I gave them my phone. They said they would replace the screen with original Samsung parts. I paid them $371. The home button on the new screen would get stuck and the microphone did not work.

Wednesday 7/12: They told me the screen then put on was aftermarket and that they would get a new part from their vendor. In the meantime, they put a used & scratched screen on my phone.

Saturday 7/15: They put on a new screen. The screen was again aftermarket and the button would get stuck. They said they would go to their vendor again on Monday to get another screen.

Tuesday 7/18: They called me and told me that their vendor did not have any other screens. They told me they paid $270 for the aftermarket screen. They offered me an absurd $40 for my troubles. I told them that I paid them $371 to fix my phone and they did not. They used screen they gave me has scratches. They needed to give me much more than $40.

THEY SHOULD NOT MAKE A PROFIT FOR NOT FIXING MY PHONE!!!

The deal was very simple. I paid them $371 to replace my cracked screen with a new one. They took my money and gave me a used & scratched screen. They wasted several days of my time.</Text><gmap_id>0x80dcdbff366af587:0x54d028852cc0e7f3<//gmap_id>< userid>

Came in to fix my simple cracked screen. Left with sticky volume button. Came back to fix the volume button. Left with no cell service. Came back a third time and all the problems were finally fixed.

Wasted 2 hours of my time. They fix one thing, but break another.

I almost wish i had kept my screen cracked!

While I was waiting, another customer arrived to pick up his phone that was being "fixed" there for 2 months. He also only had a broken screen but when he picked it up the speakers were broken.

You are immediately pressured to give the company a 5 star review to get
$5 off the total price. This is in my opinion the only reason Cellspot is rated highly.</review>

<text>I came in with a shattered back on an iPhone 4S. The repair cost $25 and took less than 10 minutes to complete. I thought the price was reasonable after comparing it with several other repair shops in Orange County.

I would recommend to others and come back for any future needs.</text>< pics>

Perhaps my recent experience with this shop was just an unfortunate incident as you might say, but I have to get it off my chest anyway. Over a week ago, my son and I brought in his S4 for a glass replacement job. The phone was still working fine except for a little crack on the glass screen. The clerk warned us of a small risk of damaging the LCD during the process, but it would be less likely to happen. If agreed, the task would take at least 2 to 3 hours.

Three hours task turned to 10 hours of anxiety and frustrations. Long story short, we felt as if the technician performed three separate practiced runs on the phone. In the end, the repair job was not anywhere near complete. The first 3 hours trial left one of the phone buttons completely dead. To fix this problem, the second trial took place for another 3 hours just to introduce series of different issues. This time, not only the phone volume was damage, the motion sensor did not work at all. Though the buttons seemed to work, they were quite sticky and dull. To make things worse, there was a noticeable stain on the camera lens itself.

Last weekend we gave the shop one last chance to make it right. This third attempt actually lasted 4 hours long. To our disappointment, only the motion sensor was working again. The camera seemed to get worse even though the technician claimed that the lens has been replaced with the best one around. The clerk assured us that the weekend staff has done everything that they could.  She went on that our only option was to make an appointment to see the shop owner during the week.

Frankly, we lost our confidence in this repair shop altogether. We reluctantly asked for our money back but the owner, over the phone, insisted that we would give him another chance. Obviously, he refused to issue a refund. Without any further protest, we decided to leave and that was the end of it.

Here is my 2 cents:

- For those who got so impressed with their fast service: It only took them 10 hours to undo my phone.

- For those who look for quick service. Be careful!  There is a fine line between quickness and sloppiness.

- For people like me who got impatient from time to time. Don't rush, spend the time checking your devices thoroughly before paying the bill.< /Text>

My galaxy s3 home screen button wasn't working. Radio shack quoted me 210 + tax
Shawn at cell spot originally quoted $90  but once they got the phone opened up he found out that it was only dirty and cleaned it up and got it working great and only charged me $50.
Very happy with the quick service.
thank you.</Review>

<Review>I wish I could give zero stars.  I wish I could give negative stars.  I wish I could suck some of the stars out of the sky to create a unique black hole that would represent my experience with this company.

I usually don't post reviews, but as this company asked me to do so in their email, I will do just that.  Every single interaction with this company has been a disaster.  I had my phone picked up for repair yesterday and was told the repair would take a half an hour.  Over an hour later I emailed the company to see the status of my phone, and shortly after it was returned with a shoddy screen repair job.  There were noticeable blown out white spots on the screen.

I immediately called the customer service line provided by their email, where the person on the other line was confused and told me to call the repair shop (not sure why they have a complaint line that can't do anything).  After calling the shop someone came out to my house and replaced the screen in my apartment.  Unfortunately there were even more blown out spots....And a big crack on the screen!

They then took my phone for a THIRD TIME and replaced the screen.  When the tech came to my place he scolded me for not unlocking the phone.  Yes, because a company that has failed the job twice and been spotty in communication and coordination seems like one that I want to unlock my personal info to.  I then saw that the screen again had blown out spots on the screen!  And the home button now feels loose, so the phone is actually WORSE off than the first time!

I managed to get a hold of a manager after sending a complaint email who reimbursed me for service (not parts).  This morning I received an apology email from the President who, to his credit, explained that the screens were faulty and that he would talk with his crew and get back to me before noon today.  Not to his credit: he never got back to me.  If you make a commitment, stick to the commitment.

I am now pressing them to reimburse me for parts as well, as the current screen I have is also faulty.  They are saying I can only do that if I bring the phone in and return the current screen.  First, I don't know why they want a broken screen back; and second, no way in hell I am letting their techs touch my phone again.

I was promised a quick job, and here I am on day two.  The only people who I am proud of are my toddlers who have shown ample patience while dealing this this debacle.

Do not fix your phone here.  If your phone is in need of repair, go to a different store or the Apple Store.  Or, throw your phone in the garbage, pour a glass of whiskey and watch the California sunset in peace.  Your phone is not worth the trouble.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics></record>

<text>Amazing service! Accidentally dropped my Iphone while moving into my apartment and went to the Apple Store to get it fixed. I should have known they were going to charge me a ridiculous amount to fix it, either that or wait a week for a replacement. I did some quick searching online and found this place with great reviews.  I was a little skeptic about all these 5-star reviews, but nonetheless I took my phone in. Close to an hour later my phone was as good as new! They even provided me with a screen cover free of charge. I cannot emphasized what lifesavers they are! Would definitely recommend to anyone in the area if they would need a phone repair.<//text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

I bought and Iphone 6 from Eliseo for a good price. He told me it would work on the Sprint network. I tried to activate it with Sprint for over 2 hours. They kept telling me that this phone could only be activated on the Sprint PREPAID NETWORK. I have the Srint FAMILY POST PAID NETWORK. What a load of crap Sprint. So, I was afraid that I was out the cost of the phone. I went back to the Cell Spot store. When I explained the problem, Eliseo did not hesitate to refund my money. It is good to find honest cell phone sellers.< /Review>

<Review>Wow! Came in and they had my phone repaired in less than 10 minutes! I happened to choose this place because it was open early and I didn't want to wait until 10pm.

Saeed did a great job and even helped me make sure that my phone worked before I paid the fee. I had been worried that maybe the camera wouldn't work after my last fall.

Price is reasonable and sure beats paying assurion their fee to replace a phone. I hope I don't have to come back, but if I needed to or had a friend who needed a repair, I give this place a very high recommendation.</Review>< Pictures>

I have used the service at CellSpot twice in the last year for cracked iPhone 5 screens (yes, I am the mother of teenagers).   The staff is friendly and attentive to the many customers coming in and calling by phone.  On our most recent visit, we were helped by Shawn, who was very helpful and had the phone ready in 15 minutes while we waited.  We paid a very fair price ($89) for the service.  Broken phones and tablets are an unfortunate reality, but I am grateful to have found CellSpot!</Text>

My friend told me about Cell Spot in Tustin and finally I can see what I'm typing and who is calling me again. It was super affordable and they were very helpful and friendly.

<Review>When I was out in Tustin visiting family, my cell phone screen broke and somehow that made the rest of my phone start to glitch, and turn on and off constantly. Luckily, I had heard about CellSpot from family and so I went there and they same day repaired my phone! It was such great, fast, and friendly service; I was very impressed! The employees were very nice and informational and they really saved me and my job that day by getting my phone working properly again! I really needed my phone that day for an audition and the employees were quick to help me out! They were also very nice to explain everything in detail to me so that I understood what was wrong with my phone and the best options to get it fixed right away which is so awesome and hard to come by these days at reputable businesses! I would definitely use this service again in the future when I am in the area! Not to mention they offer a great discount with a groupon (check to see if it's active at the time) something I wish more businesses offered!<//Review></record>

Cellspot is the place to go with your all cellphone problems, they have so far fixed 2 of my phones, a Samsung mega and my iPhone 4s over a year ago. They are so professional and would advise  you in any possible way before they go ahead a do any repairs. Shawn was very helpful and he offered me a huge discount. Their work is guaranteed and they offer warrant for their job and products. You will never regret going to Cellspot!!<//Review>

<review>Shawn & Alisio hook it UP! Problem was so bad with my phone it needed a new MOTHERBOARD! Under $70 and my old Galaxy S3 is like new again. I am a big DIY guy and I will never do it myself again. Straight to Cellspot is where I will go. Their principals of business are sound and trustworthy. Pay for your service only if they FIX the original problem! WHO DOES THAT? Great business. Thanks Shawn!< /review>< pictures>

<text>Not Bad, Not Trustworthy

[Background]
I visited here to repair the front glass of Samsung Galaxy S4 (GS4). The front glass was cracked, but digitizer was perfectly working. This device was manufactured and distributed in Korea market. The staff told me that they can replace the front glass only, and it will cost $90.

When I went back store to pick up my phone, I got to know that I have to replace a whole display part (glass + digitizer) because the original digitizer (of mine) was broken during the repair process. According to the staff, it was IMPOSSIBLE to separate the front glass from digitizer because the display part of my Korean GS4 is different from American GS4. Fortunately, they admitted their mistake and suggested me to replace the whole display part with $150 (originally $250).

[Problem 1]
To the best of my knowledge, Samsung uses the same display part for all GS4s. I asked the staff to show me proof of that (e.g., webpage), but he couldn't. Thus, I'm not convinced that the damage to my original digitizer was inevitable. Apart from everything else, I was very disappointed that they couldn't repair my phone as they initially insisted.

[Problem 2]
When I got my phone back (after I paid $150), I recognized that an unidentified person gave a 5 stars and very positive comment on Google review using my GS4! Absolutely, I've never written it down. I protested about that, the staff couldn't contradict me. Honestly, I selected this store because they got many positive feedback from customers. But, it was wrong, please DO NOT make your decision solely based on Google reviews.

[Conclusion]
Even though I paid more than I thought, overall technical service was not bad (about 3 of 5 stars). However, I cannot assure they are trustworthy. I believe that honesty is the most important factor in the service industry. For these reasons, I would like to give 1 star for my experience with this store.</text></record></dataset><record>

Repaired a cracked screen. Quality of the repair was mediocre because it had an obvious air bubble. Not sure why that wasnt caught during the repaid. Time is money so I don't have time to attempt to get it re-done. Should be done right the first time.</text>

Problem: Broken Digitizer

Explanation: Somehow the digitizer broke.  For those that don't know what that is, it's the "under screen" that displays all the images/video and is the part that actually responds to touch.  Essentially the phone became completely non-functional as I could not see anything and even if I could, I couldn't control it.

Sent the phone over to Cell Spot.  They replaced the digitizer.  The phone was mailed in (surrounded with some bubble wrap).  They mailed me the now-working S3 shortly after I sent it in.  Quick and easy job.</text>< Pics>

<text>Worst experience ever.. Horrible customer service. Over bleached hair that ended up breaking up my hair terribly with an ugly yellow color. All this done by a supposedly called "hair color specialist". After this instead getting an apology, the manager treated me so badly and charged me anyway for the hair cut and their time. I called twice to the main office and I never got a call back from the person in charge. Don't ever go there!</text><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

Big shout out to Sara, she did an amazing job on my highlights.  I'm always nervous about getting blonde highlights in my hair since my hair so dark but she did a wonderful job and I could not be happier.  Absolutely love the color and the texture of it, she didn't fry it at all. 🙌💁‍♀️  (which I also worry about) Definitely will be coming back thank you Sara. 😁</Review>

<GmapID>0x80dbfd541391aa2b:0xfdd89940f4a11a2a</GmapID><text>I took my kids to the Smartstyle in Santee in the Walmart. I was told 20 m. No big deal. So went and did a little shopping, when I came back they still were not ready. Only 2 people working. One of the ladies finally entered us in the computer, she must be OCD because my daughter had her elbow exactly where her little clipboard HAD to go! Well then we ended up waiting another 15 minutes. In that time they complained about the “mess” from my kids playing in the designated carpet area. Which they did clean up, but hey maybe we they can put up some baby gates or play pens for the kids. I let it go. The my son was carrying there small container of toys and they didn’t like that either (no he was not dropping them). But another worker tried to take them from him, he’s 3. Her reason was that she didn’t want them all over and he needed to stay in the designated kids are, the rug. Finally they called up my daughter. I have 3 kids and my oldest is disabled, she was very excited and wanted to watch her sister get her haircut. The stylist told her, you are in my way you can go sit in the kids area. That was the last straw for me! And when I told the ladies that I was done this and we were leaving they defended there actions and said well we have a designated kid area.< /text>< Resp>

<text>Only because I can't give a zero. When I walked in, I saw someone cutting someone's hair. I asked if she was alone. The person in the chair said no she is not. Then proceeded to ask me what I wanted. I told her I wanted a cut and shampoo. I was told to come back in 15 minutes. When I came back the person who was doing the cut said hi and told me I needed to wait for the person who was now blow drying her hair. She then proceeded to help the person who came in after me.
When I tried to get a hold of a manager, I learned the person getting her hair cut and doing her own hair instead of taking care of customers is named Sarah.
I tried to call to notify a manager of the horrible customer service I received.
Sarah answered the phone and proceeded to tell me that she is not less than me because she is a service person. She then hung up on me, Completely inappropriate and unprofessional.
Sarah has some major issues and I will notify everyone I know to never set foot in this shop.
You will be made to wait while they are doing their own hair and then yell at you when you explain to them it is poor customer service.<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>{'time': 1548782335118, 'text': "Carmen, Thank you for letting us know.

I have started to go here more frequently. The fruits and vegetables  always look good. Pricing on fruits and vegetables are also good. Seems other item prices are high unless they are running a sale.</Review>

<rating>5</rating><text>Great as always.  I shop there at least once a week.  I save a lot of money by shpping there.  I just wish they would give me the case price when I buy First Street Orange Mango Sparkling Glacier.  That's all my husband will drink.  Has to be that flavor only.  I buy 1 or 2 cases each week.< /text><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None<//resp>< Gmap_id>

Normally I do not Shop at Smart n' Final because their meat section is so small.  This particular time I was looking for a turkey that is thawed.  I had went to 3 other stores in my area and they only had frozen.  Smart n' Final had what I needed and for cheap.< /Review>

Wondering who the genius was that came up with the idea to congregate all the customers wanting to check out on one side of the store.

In person experience was great , however the only reason I went to the store was because my online shipment was over a week behind schedule and finally called the customer service line for online sales and they cancelled my order and told me to just come into the store to buy everything because they didn't want to deliver to my building after they charged my credit card a week prior. Had to fight to get a full credit, on won because it was their refusal to deliver.  Been a customer for my entire life and was the worse experience I've ever had with them as a business. Definitely won't ever use their online order again!<//text>

<Review>I like this store. I just wish there was a bulk section. Also if they are going to have a mask required sign they should be willing to enforce it. There was only one couple that walked in without a mask and when I mentioned it to the cashier she just shrugged her shoulders. Some people just don't think the rules apply to them< /Review>< Response>

Nothing against the store itself. It’s the customer service from one specific employee. Everyone else is always friendly and helpful.

The girl who works the cashier is such a b word every time I go in there and I have never done anything to her except purchase my items and say thank you. I say girl because she acts like a little girl. I’ve been shopping at this location for years and always receive the same treatment from her but finally decided to write a review about her because I have stopped shopping there.

I’ve heard her gossiping to another cashier about a customer before, to which the other cashier told her to ask the customer she was complaining about to simply go to another line. Sounds like she has a major attitude problem that needs to be adjusted. I wish there was another line open at all times so I didn’t have to check out with her.

When I go in with my boyfriend she is nice to him and has random small talk with him and tells him to have a nice day with a smile. This person has never smiled at me and is always really nice to the person ahead of me in line and the person behind me when I’m on my way out. I don’t know why.

One time at checkout she told me the total, so I started pulling the money out. It’s obvious I make purchases with money that is not my own because I always pull it out of an envelope and not my wallet. The amount I took out was not enough so I set it down and I went into my purse to grab more. She then looked at me like I was dumb for not giving her enough money and gave me attitude about it... “I said it was $xxx.xx?” I wasn’t even ready to give her the money yet. She just took it. It should have been apparent I wasn’t done pulling out the money because I literally counted it out loud and reached for more in my purse- where I can get more money. But she wouldn’t notice that because she was blinded and deafened by her odd hatred toward me.

I used to go in weekly and purchase $100-200 worth of stuff for the store I work for, but I have stopped because she is so unpleasant. I’d rather go to Walmart down the street.

I went in for the first time in almost a year and she was in there and I received the same attitude she always gave me in the past.
I asked her if they do Apple Pay because I realized I didn’t bring enough cash. She looked at me like it was a dumb question and said yes. I said ok cool and grabbed something extra to purchase. When ringing me out, the total came out to $139.86. I gave her $130 and said this is $130. I’ll pay the rest with Apple Pay.

She took the money and started counting it. She was still counting it when she said does the screen say anything? I said yes, “Insert/swipe to pay.” Which she replied with more attitude saying to go ahead as if I were supposed to know she was ready... She was still counting the money in front of me and I wasn’t about to charge all $139 to my account. It’s her job to let the customer know when she is ready.
I tapped my phone to initiate Apple Pay. As it was processing she again asked me if the screensaid anything again, like I forgot to do something once more. I said it’s processing. She let out an angry sigh and cursed the machine as if it were so unbelivably terrible she had to spend another second with me.

At this point I’m annoyed by her because it’s like alright, girl. You gave me attitude when I asked if you did Apple Pay, and answered me in a “duh” fashion. Shouldn’t YOU know how long Apple Pay should take to process on your machine?

What did I do to her? Get over whatever jealousy you have toward me. You’re an adult.

My boyfriend has told me to ask for a manager whenever I go in there because she is always a problem. I wouldn’t waste my time. Good luck, sweetie. Have fun driving off business and hanging out on your high horse as a cashier at a grocery store.</Review>

I'm giving this place 3 stars due to the fact that their meat aisles are enclosed. It's called an extra, however I've been to an extra that has more selection. Prices are ok, meat is more expensive. Did not really look at meat quality before purchasing.<//Review>

Decent enough place. Produce is often lacking in quality. Get there soon after delivery or you won't have any cartons of uncracked eggs to choose from. Mediocre prices. It's close though. If it's not close,  don't waste your time.< /Text>

<review>Its 730am and I need to pick up something on my way to restaurant. No store hours listed here on map, website store locator function isn't working and called store hoping to hear a recording with hours just gets me a busy signal.

Only had two checkers, lines backed way up with one of the customers having two full carts to check out. So everyone went to second register.
Third checker closed her express lane while checking out a lady with about 100 items? express?  So now they called for another checker who took the man in front of me with 4 items & me with 3 items, she took us to the express line that had been closed making us wait while other checker finished with the lady with the large order, so while making us wait, all the people who were behind us in the line we were taken out of were checked out & gone!  What were they thinking? OPEN a register that's NOT BEING USED!  I should have left my 3 items &  walked out.</Text>

< Review>
Been ordering my cakes and cupcakes for 10 years now and they're always delicious and custom made to match my event theme but this last time was the best. I ordered candles online and took them in to see if they can match the colors however the lady that was working came out and started giving me ideas, she went to the back and had the Wonder Woman toppers ready, we got chocolate cake filled with strawberry and decorated with buttercream frosting. Thank you for making my little ones birthday even better we all loved the cake!<//Review>

< Review>
I love food 4 less..great customer service and super low prices. I was there earlier and I bought some keurig coffee, I guess they where stocked on the wrong spot for a low price.. When i got to the register of course it scanned the correct price but the night manager honored the lower price. I know its not a big deal to some people, but it was for me so thank you Eric and all f4l employees for always being fast, fun and friendly :)</Review>

<review>They don't have everything you want but the shoppers are great and the staff are outstanding. Shopped here for 16 years. They also have a gas station. If you spend over $100 using the card they give you get 10 cents off a gallon of gas. Love the managers I've come to know. Wish they had more flavor choices in Powerade and Gatorade. .</review>< Rate>

<Review>I like shopping at the Food 4 Less on Alessandro better because I know where everything is and they are always fully stocked and the produce is better and they have a better bakery department. But I like going to this gas station better than the other one cuz this one is less crowded and you can get in and out more easily.</Review>< pictures>

I normally never pay for gas with cash and I never will again at this station as the attendant was given $23, which I counted out, one $20 dollar bill and three singles. I then proceeded to pump my gas that stopped at $22 at the pump.. when confronted she denied that I had given her the exact amount I did. Smh... absolutely ridiculous.  Not sure her name, should have gotten that... this happened today Tuesday 9/24/19 at approximately 1pm.  It’s not the dollar it’s the principle, I hate a liar and a cheat.<//Review>< userid>

There are a few that are great, like the tall guy that straightened his hair, he's awesome, so is the assistant manager Lynn , and the tall Mexican girl with like curly hair and the short older Mexican lady, she has fantastic customer service. The rest of them can use a refresher course on how to treat the customers .<//text>< Pics>

I actually in general like this store quite a bit. I live so close, Im there sometimes 5 days a week.  Great prices, pretty good ethnic food selection, as well as organic foods. My only complaint is a COUPLE cashiers. Normally I wouldnt let two or three cashiers affect my rating of a store, but their customer service is that bad. Most of the cashiers I love, helpful, relatable, & just overall friendly. But theres several cashiers that are in the wrong job. Those never greet anyone coming thru their line, no hello, how are u?, eye contact, nothing. And act almost annoyed theyre doing their job. I cant stand when I encounter that. I vant imagine im rhe only person who notices it.< /Text>

<Date>1432410460582<//Date><Rating>1<//Rating><review>I had a very unpleasant and uncomfortable experience at the food 4 less on Perris in Moreno Valley. I have been coming to this store for years and never have I felt sodisrespected. Shopping on Thursday night May 21st my fiancé and I came to the express lane to check out and as we approached the cashier and as we were unloading our items she stopped us with a nasty face expression and a sound of annoyance she told us "oh, no uh no you got dog food. Go to the other line." With the same rude expression.  She had no one in her lane. And we were next. It was extremely rude, embarrassing, and unprofessional. My fiancé works at a market himself and would never allow that type of treatment and in a means of prejudice. The other cashier looked shocked by her comments and reaction, he checked us out without a problem. I will never return to that store again and I will make sure everyone knows just how rude DORIS the cashier was. She should NOT be working in customer service. We needed our groceries otherwise we would of left our items in her lane just to spite her. But we tried to show more class and dignity than what she showed us. I just hope this doesn't represent the rest of the company if they're allowed to treat paying customers in this manner.<//review>< pictures>

Just a store that has been upgraded this past year. Drawback is the parking lot is always full now that they put fas pumps in..y car was hit while in the store and  whoever did it drove off.</Text>

They have good pricess at the grocery store and the gas station, but you'll often find someone hitting you up for money at the gas station and the parking lot for the grocery store is not very well lit at night.< /text>

As a grocery store it gets the job done with a decent selection and low prices, but the parking lot is really sketchy at night and the security guard himself looks pretty sketchy, I mean for an in and out pick up one thing store it isn't so bad, but it could be done much better.<//text>

Did a good job on a challenging and extensive repair to my car after a large limb smashed it. Communication every step of the way was excellent. Very professional and accommodating. Would use them again.</Text>

< Review>
Just wanted to give a shout--out to the G&C auto body staff at the Santa Rosa Larkfield location. General Manager Kelly Stephens went far and beyond to make sure we were up to date and happy with the repairs done to our BMW 328i. The painter knocked it out of the park with matching the blue metallic paint to the rest of the car.... very professional and we are very happy. Without a doubt we will surely be coming back for future repairs.
Thank you Mr. Stephens & auto body techs

G & C Auto Body Larkfield is the place to bring your car.  The work done was work done well and timely.  Kelly kept us informed on a regular basis.  The staff understands the ins and outs of the insurance process and they definitely know auto body work.< /Text>

Love love my experience with Kelly at G&C first time i have ever had a repair done through insurance . The staff made it so easy and fun. They were very prompt with the repairs and kept me updated all the way . I will not be searching for any other repair shop they earned a life long customer.</Review>

I had to have much of the front end of my car replaced after a hit and run. The staff was courteous and professional and that is reflected in their work. The new parts of my car make it look brand new. The staff also kept me updated regularly on how the repairs were going. Awesome!< /Text>

You should be able to find a location close to you, if not wait a month or so and one will pop up.  Doesn't matter which location you go to you will find friendly, honest, local living employees ready to help you put your car back together the right way at a fair price.  Get a quote, drop it off and let them go to work.  When you pick it up be happy and enjoy!!</review>

<review>Great work by a professional, caring crew! Kevin has earned our trust by providing excellent service for each of the three times we needed major body work done. He put in extra time to find the source of a mysterious but irritating engine noise. So whether it's a big job or a small one, we know we can count on the team at G & C Auto Body!</review>< pictures>

<text>I found Kelly, the Gen. Mgr. of G&C Larkfield, to be the consummate professional in taking care of me and my Silverado.

<Text>I’ve lost count of how many times I’ve been to Gnc over the years and they always provide me with 5 star service. This time I took my car in for the back bumper to get fixed.

<pics>None<//pics><Review>Had my black truck rear ended took in to get the tailgate fixed. Was told it would take a day ended up taking a week. After I got me truck back I seen that they some how had damaged the side of my truck instead of telling me about it they tried to do a quick fix unfortunately its black and they did a poor job so it showed really bad you could see all the runs in the paint. Took it back and was told they could fix it in a day once again a week later all they did was burn up my paint trying to buff it out. Cost me 400 to get the swirls out of my paint from the detail shop and sadly the accident was still plan as day to see. So once again I took it back to them to fix and after them saying it will only take a day I got it back 4 days later and well it looked better this time it still wasn’t fixed. I was told that I am going to have to deal with it for a month and wait until the paint cures so they can once again try to fix it the service guy was extremely rude and they left rubbing compound all over my truck that I now will have to deal with on my own. I am disappointed in every aspect of dealing with this shop and would never bring anything back to them I just want them to fix the mistake them made I have a nice truck and take care of it but sadly they seem not to care or have the respect to fix what the openly admit they messed up yet they won’t tell me how it was they damaged my truck.<//Review><name>Wes Jackson</name>< gmapID>

Great experience the whole time vehicle was in shop. They kept me updated on my vehicle and gave me estimated times repairs will be done. Even when I don't have time to pick vehicle when car was ready, they worked with me to deliver or have someone else to pick up for me. Hopefully, not involved with another accident. If I do, I know where I'm taking my vehicle.</review>

<Review>Due to covid-19 I wasn’t able to get my car done for a month but as soon as I was able too they were ready to help me. My car was finish a day earlier then estimated Kevin and the rest of the staff were very nice and professional not only did they have my car done early but they helped me get a rental and return my rental. They also did a few extra detailing on my car for FREE! They totally went out of their way to make us feel valued as customers they gave us the best service 👌 would totally recommend this place to anyone!!< /Review><rating>5< /rating>< response>

Luis and his team are the absolute best.. quick, efficient and flexible. They don’t bother you with a bunch of extra paperwork, they work quickly and communicate wonderfully. I have used them several times now and always sing their praises to friends and family. And a side win- my car is always spotless clean inside and out when I pick it up! Super grateful for this team and especially Luis! Thank you!< /Text>

Nothing but good things to say about Larkfield G&C. Charles was great at communicating with me about the status of my car, got it fixed as quickly as possible, and it looks and drives like new. He made me laugh, as well. Jamie at the front desk was also awesome. I hope I never have to go back, but if I ever need my car fixed again, this is the place!< /Review>

<text>Professional, straight forward and they go the extra distance to make sure you are taken care of. Louis in the G&C site off Mark West Springs is amazing. I had an issue on a Saturday. He came down to the shop, checked me in, all while the shop was closed. Can't recommend them enough.<//text>< Pics>

Would recommend this auto body shop to anyone who loves their auto! I was greeted by friendly staff, given an accurate estimate for the repair/replacement cost, kept up to date as the repairs progressed and notified when my car was ready for pickup. End result, my beautiful car back with me in it's original state.  Excellent customer care provided by Kevin Celedon and the whole staff at G & C, Larkfield!</text>

The customer service is phenomenal! The staff is super friendly and the waiting area is nice and cozy. Having to repair my car is not a pleasant task, but I felt very comfortable leaving my car here and they made it so easy! One of the employees, I believe his name is Kelly, was super helpful and gave me a realistic time frame of when everything will be done which I really appreciated. I felt part of the family there! Definitley will be coming back if my car needs anything else. Great shop and Kelly made my experience there worthwhile!</Review>

<text>Luis greeted me with a smile and a confident demeanor. He was through with his estimate and provided a description of the work needed to bring my truck to factory specs. When I picked up my truck on the date I was promised, he went the extra mile to get the factory parts needed to meet our  delivery date. The part needed was shipped from the factory on a delivery route that took only 1 day versus 3 days. Don't know how he did it, but I was appreciative of his efforts. Overall the staff at G&C Auto Body, Larksfield, promised and delivered! My truck is now back to the way it was before the accident. Horray!!!!!<//text><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None<//Response>< GmapID>

Getting my car smooshed was not what I wanted to do first thing in the morning. But I knew to go right to G and C Autobody in Larkfield because I work in the area. I was greeted by Jamie at the front counter and she got me all set up with a loaner car that came to pick me up there and assisted in filing the claim.
Kevin was the estimator that was very professional and kept me up to date with the whole process.
When i picked up my car, a few days earlier then i thought it would be (yay), my car looked better then new!
Thank you to Kevin, Jamie and Kelly for taking great care of me and my car.< /Text>

Customer service was good but the wax itself was bad. The waxer laid it on too thick and let it cool while she looked for the actual wax strip which made it more painful when pulling. It took her a few tries to actually get the wax strip off, at times the wax would be too hot and it burned me. Afterwards I was experiencing a lot of irritation and had redness along with bumps. Not coming back.</review>

My overall experiences at The Wax Lounge have been awesome. Everyone I've come in contact with is friendly and very helpful in answering any questions. Brandi is my go to person for the Brazilian. She is easy to talk to, makes the process comfortable, gets it done quickly, and of course produces amazing results! This establishment works efficiently to create a pampering ambiance, yet still gets you in and out without waiting around. I definitely recommend The Wax Lounge to anyone interested in these type of services.</Text>

<Text>I absolutely love this place . I was introduced to Clara by my sister in law and I will not go with no one else . She does my Brazilian and my brows , she even did a baby  facial for me as well ( which I loved ) but she is letting my brows grow slowly and shaping them wonderfully . What else can I say about my Brazilian except that there is no hair and she is very professional .

I would recommend Clara , she is wonderful and I will continue coming here just for her .< /Text>< Pictures>

Clara was such a sweetheart she made sure my first wax went as smoothly as possible. She told me the importance and benefits of waxing, gave me a list of things to do for after care, & left me smooth! I will definitely be coming back!</text>

<Response>None< /Response><Review>I was terrified of the unknown pain. It is painful, but its bearable. The top part feels like threading. Normal. The lip is the part that caught me off guard. Other than that, smooth. Wax was hot, but not extremely uncomfortable. Im a big girl, i was just nervous and worried. But Brandi made me feel like a friend, i honestly forgot she was waxing me.

Brandie is absolutely the best. I’ve been going to her for about two years now. A manzillion is soooo painful if you don’t have the right person doing it. I was 2 months overdue and SCARED to go in. I went, it’s done MINIMAL DISCOMFORT because Brandy knows what she is doing. She is by far the best.< /review>

<review>1st time customer, made same day appt. i was told id have to put a credit card down. No mention of a cancellation policy. Full disclosure, I was 6 minutes late.  Was called at three minutes late and tersely informed that my appt was being bumped. Not a big deal to be bumped. Rudeness is a big deal. Got there and sat waiting, had a chance to then read their policies.

The store policies are written in an insulting manner. They refer to customers that are even a few minutes late as "flakes", "flakaroonies", and "cornflakes." They specifically state that if you are a flake you probably shouldn't make an appointment with them, that they "don't like flakey people." According to their definition, I was a "flake" and they did not like me. I felt very insulted by this policy. I allotted an appropriate amount of time to travel, but did not realize they were located across train tracks and did not account for being stuck at a train. I didn't mind being bumped as the appointments are very short, but I did not appreciate being labeled by them. I certainly no longer felt comfortable to allow them to wax the most sensitive areas of my body!

I approached the counter and asked to please cancel my appointment, that I no longer felt comfortable. The individual at the counter (the same person who ran my card, it turned out) told me she was sorry I was uncomfortable but could not refund my money. I asked why. She said because I had not canceled 48 hours prior to my appointment. I had made the appointment that same day, literally 2.5 hours prior. There is no way I could have cancelled. She said she would call her manager and then call me later to let me know whether I could have my money back. She said that she could not issue a refund but her manager could. I said this was not acceptable. I asked to speak to the manager. She said I would have to wait about 20 minutes, but could not give me a specific time. I was about to give up in frustration.

The manager, Demi, arrived within about 10 minutes. She was not sympathetic to me not wanting to go through with the service. She made sure to point out that people traveled from all over to have services done. I explained that I did not care about these other people. That I would please like my money back, that as a "flake" I would never bother them by making an appointment there again. She refused. She stated that she had no authority to issue refunds and that I needed to have cancelled 48 hours prior. Again, I do not understand how I could have done that. She said well that's our company policy, which was sent to you in an email. I explained that the email had been sent AFTER they ran my credit card.

Another customer walked in at that point and I could tell the manager did not want them to hear our exchange. She asked me to leave because I was "badgering them". I said I would be happy to leave once I received my refund. The manager refused, saying it would take at least a business day to hear back from corporate. And then, IF they decided to allow me my refund, it would take another week to put the funds back to my card. I asked to speak to someone at corporate. I was denied this. I asked the manager to call corporate. She said they had no phone number. At this point, it was 1:30 pm and I had been trying to get my money back for over 30 minutes. I was extremely upset and baffled by the behavior. I asked if they were on yelp and they said they were. I said I would be leaving a negative review. They didn't seem to care. I finally had no choice but to leave, because I had to get back to work.<//review></record>

I got an absolutely stunning rib piece done by Hemi a few weeks ago. She was super kind and the custom tattoo she created for me is gorgeous!! The place itself is beautiful and very clean. The atmosphere of the studio made me feel very comfortable and excited about my new art. I will definitely be returning here!! If I could give the entire experience more than five stars, I would.</text>

She's done my half-sleeve on my left arm and my entire right sleeve, which is still a work in progress.  I get stopped on the street or in the gym all the time because people want to talk about my tattoos. June's watercolor effect, and her creativity, are world-class.  She's so easy to collaborate with and her work is so original.  I couldn't be happier as a client (as evident by the fact that I keep coming back to see her over and over and over again).  If you like original, one-of-a-kind, world-class tattoos, with a touch of watercolor effect, book time with June!<//Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOQjN7ZHY0Db7eH_3R-zbhioOSrKWs80QlXXUO-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOW2ytAtfmElPH3R2kkb9fEZvhmpOUftv4pLeGJ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOtzPprIp8Boefp8NAZMvRWy2jf78WqClQTMEzP=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNXU4imYHJwoIT17EK7a6A4-sAXd8L0X_tSzkvI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPQV2XZHoY18QHZMb3fVLg_NDBaWcdMmE99te9Q=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPiUHUu2tBhCqMIlG9XhL1Os6SzvYklk5iFbVt3=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><Response>{'time': 1510188234232, 'text': 'Thank you so much, Joe!

I cannot say better things about June's artistry! I have a 3/4 floral sleeve that was done by June in February and I am ALWAYS getting compliments on my tattoo wherever I go. June's meticulous attention to detail while maintaining a very natural style is amazing.
I chose June for my tattoo as I was looking to get a watercolor styled tattoo and I was not disappointed!
She was courteous and accommodating the whole session and I can't wait to go back for more already. They also provided clear and detailed instructions on tattoo aftercare and my tattoo healed up in a little over a week.
I'm still blown away by the vivid colors and artwork of my sleeve everyday.

If you are thinking about getting a tattoo with watercolor styles, I would recommend June any day! But be patient because she is usually booked due to demand, the wait is definitely worth it!
Thanks again, June and Rob!< /text>

I've been getting tattoos for 17 years and have sat dozens of times. I've been to working class street shops and glitzy parlors catering to fancy clientele.

My experience at June Jung Art was by far the most relaxing and enjoyable first time experience I've had. The shop is clean and well maintained. June and Rob are warm and welcoming.

In addition to the shop experience the tattoo quality is amazing. I sent an idea to June and when I came into the shop she had three different versions of the design ready for me. We had a quick conversation about which I preferred, and decided on color -- all without stress or pressure.

June is fantastic at what she does. The tattoo was the least painful I've experienced, placement is perfect, and it healed without a hitch.

I would absolutely recommend June to anyone -- in fact, I received a number of compliments just walking around the city in the days following. Every time it came up I immediately referred them to June's studio.<//Text>

<Review>My experience with June and Rob was a fantastic experience from start to finish. June's art speaks for itself, and I am thrilled to have her work tattooed. The shop is clean, relaxing, and a work of art on its own. The consultation, scheduling, and day of the appointment was simple, accommodating, effortless, and fun! The tattoo is simply amazing, and is my favorite from the three I have. I even appreciated how she incorporated touches of my mom's flowers and hand-made jewelry, as well was able to tattoo both me and my wife on the same day.

There are very few 5 star experiences in my book, and June is one of them!<//Review><Rating>5</Rating><Time>1512889033110<//Time>< name>

June is an incredible artist with such a beautiful and unique style! I am so grateful to rock three of her original paintings (photos attached). Booking with Rob was quick and super convenient. Her shop is extremely clean and comfortable.

June took the time to listen to my concerns in terms of placement. She took pictures of my preferred body placements and then applied the digital image of the sketch against each placement to show me exactly how the tattoo would look on my actual skin.

For me, placement is key as the tattoo needs to flow with the contours of the body. June's fine lines and color application skills are unmatched. You won't be disappointed!

<Review>I reached out to June's studio after losing one of my best friends. I wanted a tattoo that reflected two of the things we loved best...cats and books. The design process was great. I sent June, and her husband Rob who helps manage the business, a series of "look books" of images that gave a sense of what I was looking for in a watercolor tattoo. When I arrived for my session, I sat with June and she unveiled her design. I was instantly in love. I'll admit I was nervous showing up for a tattoo of a design I hadn't seen yet. But as a writer I completely get the process. My nervousness was completely dispelled when I saw how perfectly June had translated my many images into a single, perfect vision. The shop is lovely. The people are lovely. And the whole process was as painless as a tattoo can be. But more than anything I am so impressed with June's artistry. The detail is amazing! I very highly recommend June and her studio.<//Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNB2s2COKGABZf3PvdjqwD5RQ9rFYbjsndGoNI2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMGjU8FAhP8zKUOdIB9qBzjtWAqhUi9HvmMUrB4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics><Response>None<//Response>< gmapID>

<Review>June is a TOTAL BADASS! And an amazing artist! I had dreamed of getting a cardinal tattoo for the longest time and as soon as I saw her artwork I knew she was the perfect artist for me. The meaning had such deep sentimental value for me I was almost nervous to get it done at all, but it turned out more perfect that I could have imagined. The wait time for my consultation was faster than I expected and she even managed to fit me in for the tattoo before she had a baby!! Did I mention she was adorably freaking pregnant when she did my tattoo. So awesome! Artwork-Perfect, Atmosphere-Clean & Serene, Price-100% reasonable and exactly what I expected
I recommend this shop to everyone👍🏽❤️🎉✌🏽</Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPmFwr8ZPqVfprHaNCn-TVcTiuPwZGo5gZh6Z_8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMzCLY2UTxQqAxrUf-VxQ8wIAQ3vICgaVPdK-vN=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNxPQrW8kW_J6JqAPLJxPk40uNaso6GDbj3xoVu=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOXnvTQzGNiTDVrixc_W0LQVYXh94TFAEFxJuBv=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM5FZY_pG433_1YjxYcMgtwh3qT2V2U8OlaZv5_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics>< resp>

I cannot be happier with the work! June was so great in helping me bring my vision to life. My dog, flowers from my home state and my new home.

This was my first tattoo and I really didn’t know what to do or how to start. I simply emailed June with some simple thoughts and what I wanted. Her and Rob emailed me back with some follow up information about the cost and other details.

We setup a consultation for just a couple weeks later. From the consultation during the actual appointment date I was so comfortable. I chatted with Rob during most of my tattoo and June was great about walking me through the process. You know... it did hurt, but only some. June put plenty of numbing spray on it and knocked it put in only 4 hrs! I was blown away with how great the piece came out. When she did the final contrast shading it all hit me with the feels. I loved seeing this amazing piece turn out.

I cannot wait to get more done by her. Her work isn’t cheap, but she is more than worth it! You get what you pay for and she could easily charge more.

She has some great original pieces and hopefully I can get one of those also.

Great work, great vision, so worth it! Thank you June!  ❤️❤️<//text>

<text>All I did was send June pictures of flowers I wanted for my tattoo (7 in total) and she created my dream design. The studio is clean and bright, and June and Rob (her husband) are extremely accommodating, and do a really great job of communicating everything you need to know. My session was 4 hrs and was truly so easy. I can't wait for my arm to be fully healed so I can just look at it alllll the time :) She is crazy talented and there is no one else I could've imagined designing and tattooing this for me.<//text>< rating>

<text>I got in touch with June Jung Art purely through social media and that's how I discovered them. I was visiting LA for a little over a month and was able to book a few consultations and finally an appointment to get a start on a tattoo I've been hoping to get for awhile now.

I worked with Beto as my tattoo artist. He's kind and good to work with. We had some difficulties in the beginning figuring out some detail work of my tattoo, but I'll take the blame for not having a completely clear vision on what I wanted when I walked in. In the end we decided to just work on the main body of the tattoo art first, and perhaps re-visit the tattoo again at a later time.

The work that I did get done turned out BEAUTIFULLY. I am so happy with how it turned out. The detailed fine line work wasn't easy for Beto but he rocked it out.

Robert, June's husband, was always very good at communicating with me and helping me set up times to come in for consultations and finally my tattoo appointment.

Even if you aren't in their LA area - the drive to their studio is absolutely worth it. I highly recommend!< /text><response>None</response>< Rate>

<text>First, I have to start by saying that this was my first tattoo EVER. It was a memorial tattoo in honor of my father, who I lost over the summer. So I was nervous, excited and very picky about who put this on my body.

Second, everything about my experience here was wonderful! A) booking an appointment was easy-breezy, Rob (June's husband) was quick to respond and to correspond any questions I had with the artist, Beto.

Third, Beto was amazing. Quite, soft spoken, and patient. Made any and all changes to my piece on the spot. The tattooing process was quick, easy and he has what I would imagine a "light hand", because the pain was pretty minor. And I couldn't be happier with the finished product!! The lines are clean and so delicate, and the pieces came out perfect :)</text><Gmap_id>0x80c2c1510b446465:0xc474c796b47d40db<//Gmap_id>< username>

I was giddy after being on June's wait list and hearing that I would have the opportunity to work with her.

The shop is so aesthetically pleasing. The natural light bounces off the bright walls and the windows give it a modern feel.

Everyone at the shop is genuinely excited to be there. Rob and June were very easy to speak and work with through the whole process, even as I came from out of state for the piece.

I will cherish this piece forever (obviously) and I am still speechless by June's proficiency in art as a whole. Thank you for making this memorial, beautiful.<//Text>

<review>The ‘June Jung’ Studio is probably the most professional studio I have ever seen.
Everybody was super nice and helpful.
Communication worked flawlessly.
But most importantly, Hemi, the Artist, did such a fantastic job.
Hemi not only immediately understood the idea behind what I wanted (even though I provided 2 very different types of sketches) but she made the draft and the end result so much better than I imagined!
I was truly blown away by her artistic skill. I can't thank her enough for this wonderful piece of art.
thank you!< /review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

<user_name>Robert Delatorre<//user_name><Text>Found shop by word of mouth and then locating them online.

Originally June's work caught my eye but when I found Hemi's art work she stole my heart. Its soft, elegant and precise.

I submitted my idea and within a few days Rob emailed me and I was on my way!

Booking is easy and online. You pay an amount towards your tattoo and get a date

Parking is street parking (I didn't see a lot) but there's plenty around the shop. I parked across the street with ease

Hemi had several designed made and I liked all of them so much we collaborated to mash them together and came out with my tattoo!

Hemi is friendly, sweet, open to discussing design, even going as far as redesign on the spot via tablet (prior to tattooing)

Rob was awesome, knowledgeable and welcoming.

The entire staff was laid back and I felt incredible from the minute I walked. Will definitely be adding more and coming back!<//Text><gmapID>0x80c2c1510b446465:0xc474c796b47d40db< /gmapID><Rate>5< /Rate><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPxniRhMGhh7Ajo8A6U_LnrP_bGSU_W2d2TZh4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics>< resp>

June and Rob are both incredibly welcoming and friendly people.  The studio is clean, bright, and has a nice feeling to it.  I contacted June a few months before to schedule my appointment with a vague description of an idea and a few reference images.  What she came up with was so much better than what I had in my head.  Once we started the tattoo it was easy to relax with some music in the background.  It was a pleasure to meet them.  I would absolutely go back to June for another tattoo, her style and passion is absolutely unmatched!

Also, parking was pretty easy to find in the area.< /text>

<GmapID>0x80c2c1510b446465:0xc474c796b47d40db<//GmapID><name>LeAnn Foss<//name><text>Got my first tattoo here! I was looking for months for an artist who does watercolor tattoos well in the Los Angeles area and was about to give up and book a flight to another country when I came across June's work on Instagram. I went to a tattoo convention where there were hundreds of artists to see who else was available in the LA area. Seeing June's unique style juxtaposed with all the other artists there, I knew she was just what I was looking for!

June and Rob were super helpful and personable throughout the consultation/design process and responded quickly via email to all of my questions and requests. I gave June my concept for the design, and she took off and ran with it.

The day of the actual appointment, I was running late and didn't have time to eat beforehand. Without skipping a beat, Rob offered me and my friend that I had brought with me a selection of healthy snacks they had on hand. June and Rob did a great job of putting me at ease, knowing that I was nervous because it was my first tattoo. Also, a note about the space.... most tattoo shops are cluttered and kitschy. This place is not that. It's super open and you feel like you can actually breathe. Waaaayyyyy less stressful for someone like me who was nervous to begin with!

Here comes the best part.... the whole tattoo only took 2 hours! I've gotten a million compliments on it, and everyone is always blown away by how detailed it is. Most people assume that it took several sessions and hardly believe me when I tell them it only took 2 hours!

Tl;dr June is great.<//text>< user>

Love my new artwork by June Jung!  I feel so incredibly lucky to have found her.  Literally stumbled upon her shop, looked her up on google and Instagram and I was hooked by her beautiful artistry.  Couldn’t believe it when Rob told me she had an opening the next week.   The shop is clean and well lit.  June and Rob were so friendly and welcoming which made for a great experience.  Thank you! I’ll be coming back.</text>

June gave me my first tattoo and my whole experience very enjoyable from start to finish.  From the consultation and communication about the appointment to the day of the appointment, everything involved in this process was easy and enjoyable.

I have known for a few years that I wanted a watercolor tattoo and after I came across her work, I knew that I wanted her to tattoo me. She does such beautiful and amazing work that just speaks for itself.

Her shop is very clean and comforting and I really appreciated the time and care that June took during our consultation. She was very patient and nice as I explained my design and made me feel like I could really take the time to tweak the design until I was really happy with it. Any suggestions that she did make were all to make sure that the tattoo could come look as good as possible.

I also love that she also took a picture of my arm and digitally placed my design on my arm so I could get an idea of what it would look like in real time.

On the day of the appointment, I was a little nervous, but June and Rob are such nice people that they really put me at ease. They answered all of my questions and made me comfortable throughout the whole process.

For the tattoo itself, June has such a light touch. I put on a numbing cream so I wouldn't be in too much pain in the beginning.  However, even when the cream wore off, it was a very tolerable experience.

This was a 10/10 experience from start to finish. I am in love with my tattoo and it has come out better than I imagined</Text>< pics>

<rating>5< /rating><text>I just want to start by saying June exceeded any expectations I could of had .I am absolutely in love with my tattoo.I found her work on Instagram and knew instantly that I wanted my first tattoo to be done by her .I emailed her link on her website and within a day was contacted by her husband Rob who recommended we do a consultation.That really I think made the difference because I knew what I wanted just not how .The day of the consultation I walked into this great studio space with June’s art displayed .June was finishing up a tattoo at the time .Once she was done she asked about placement size and concept and started drawing away.She gave me a couple of options and worked with any input I made .We agreed on a sketch and I left my deposit and had an appointment for the actual tattoo.The best part is I left knowing that I was dealing with a true professional .Yesterday was finally the day of my first tattoo .Once June got to work  you could tell she was in her element she’s a true artist .when she finished I expected it to hurt so much more .I am so thankful to both of them they are a great duo and made my experience so great .I will definitely be going back .< /text>< Pictures>

I am in LOVE with my new ink! June is very talented and conveyed my vision perfectly. She also works so fast and meticulously that I was in awe when the tattoo was finished.

I stumbled upon June by searching watercolor tattoo on Yelp. After reviewing her works, my decision was made. I messaged them on Yelp and got a reply from Rob within the day. The initial consultation appointment was set up via email exchanges. To help with the process, I sent some artwork/picture that are related to what I wanted to June/Rob.

During the consultation, I described what I envisioned and June did a quick sketch on her iPad with references from the artwork/picture I provided. I told her where I would want it and how big. That was pretty much it. At the end of the consultation, I scheduled the appointment for the actual tattoo.

In between the appointments, I communicated with June/Rob on further refining the idea and provided a few more pictures.

And then the big day came... when June showed me her final draft, I couldn't help but smiled from ear to ear because it was gorgeous! I knew at that instant I picked the perfect artist.<//text>

I was researching a place with an artistic and unique perspective to get my first tattoo in 25 years.  I found June online, and although she was booked, I was lucky to have one of their super talented and innovative South Korean guest tattoo artists, Oddmapper, create my tattoo.  I am beyond happy with result and the incredible artistry with which he and the artists here approach tattooing.    The entire experience from a customer service standpoint was exceptional and totally pro!   They are extemely thoughtful and professional, not to mention insanely talented artists.  Their studio is stunning as well - very open and spacious and inviting with superb musical tastes in the background during the experience.  I actually cannot wait to get an appointment with June in the future for another tattoo.  Highly recommend!<//text>

<Review>Absolutely love, love my new tattoo from June! The whole process was pretty straightforward. I initially called and got my initial consultation appointment set up. Upon meeting June, she took a picture of the area that I wanted my tattoo and sketched up something really quickly to get a better idea of what I wanted. After agreeing to what I wanted, we got the actual tattooing session scheduled.

Even at the tattoo session, I was pleasantly surprised by what she came up with, and how efficient she was with tattooing the tattoo. I’m not going to lie; it was a bit painful, but I know for sure that I won’t need touch ups afterwards. I highly recommend her!</Review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

Just finished up getting my first-ever tattoo, and I gotta say the whole experience from start to finish, the initial consultation and the actual session were  incredible ! Rob and June are genuine, caring and humble people. I was a little anxious just because I had no idea what to expect, and although I had a pretty specific idea in mind of what I wanted done, I was worried I wouldn’t be able to explain or get that same idea over to an artists mind. Well with June that worry and fear diminished right away. Before I even finished fully explaining what I had in mind she had already begun drawing and incorporating her own beautiful style on an actual picture of the area on my body I had in the mind for the piece! (Talk about getting a legit preview ! ) It’s like we were on the same exact page. Any small adjustments or suggestions I had she took into consideration and altered it until I was completely happy with the work. I couldn’t stop smiling when I saw the finished picture because I had been waiting for sooooo long, years, to get my first tattoo and couldn’t believe it was a picture of something that was actually going on me.

The studio is clean, spacious, welcoming, and ridiculously calming. Chill tunes on the whole time, and felt like I was in good hands the whole time. Had my family with me at first and they felt comfortable enough to grab some drinks and food near by while waiting for my session to finish.

Thank you guys so much for making this a superb experience. I am in love with my tattoo. I know I will be stopping by again.

Hope nothing but the best for you two!< /review>

I found Bailey on Instagram ( @needlef0x) and do not regret having her do work on my arm. I had a general idea of what I wanted, but Bailey was able to execute my vision wonderfully. Plus her vibe is excellent!! I am super stoked to continue working with her to fill out my arm!</text>

<text>Simply put, June is amazing. The location is clean and welcoming with plenty of street parking. When you first arrive you will talk with June about the tattoo and you can add your input for the finishing touches. She listens and makes suggestions that will bring out the best in your tattoo.

Once you are happy with your design it’s time to start the tattoo process. June has a light hand which if you are have a long session, you have sensitive skin, are nervous about the pain of a first tattoo, or you just don’t want to feel like you got beat up is an important factor to consider.

As a tattoo artist she’s one of best when it comes to watercolor and realism. She creates amazing designs that can incorporate the ideas you have for the best possible tattoo for you.<//text>< rate>

<text>I have nothing but glowing reviews about my experience with June and Rob. From setting up a consultation, working with June on the design for my tattoo, and getting the actual tattoo itself I felt like I was in capable and professional hands. June is first and foremost an artist but I especially appreciated her ability to take my ideas and make them a reality. Her willingness to make adjustments and work with me to make me 100% satisfied with my tattoo were so appreciated. I could not be more happy with my modernized durga icon, she really made my dream come true! Thank you June!!!!! Plus you can't beat the laid back atmosphere of Rob and June's shop, felt like I was in their hyper clean and beautiful living room, equal parts comfortable, peaceful and so super clean!! Thanks for making my first big tattoo experience so amazing :)<//text>< pics>

Great experience, very accommodating. June has a wonderful studio, the stations are very clean, She and her husband were very welcoming. Take care to check your spam folder. Somehow the first of Rob's correspondence came through, but additional inquiries did not? Don't know how my e-mail filter did that. They communicated well though despite my concerns, it turned out to be an issue with my e-mail.< /review>

<Rating>5<//Rating><text>June was so patient with me when it came to deciding the style and location of my tattoo. I am usually not such an indecisive person but for some reason it was hard for me to decide with this specific tattoo. She directed me in the right direction and I instantly fell in love with my piece when I saw it completed. I got a Korean hibiscus on my left rib area and it is BEAUTIFUL! Her work is so detailed and amazing I cant even describe in words. I was also afraid of it being super painful but it actually wasn't that bad at all. Her style is amazing!! I thought this would be my last tattoo but I am definitely going to have to come back to her for more.</text>< Response>

<Text>My entire experience with June and her studio was amazing. Her husband Rob handles business inquiries and scheduling and is always quick to respond, making it easy for me to set up a consultation and appointment. June's consultation process is great too- she took a picture of my wrist and began mocking it up on her ipad so I could see the design get fleshed out in real time.

I originally wanted a simple tattoo of my father's calligraphy, but thought it would look even better with some abstract watercolor involved. From the previous reviews on Yelp, I gathered that June would be a great fit- they said she took ideas and applied her own artistic interpretation to create beautiful tattoos. At my consultation, I talked about my idea and the mockup she drew for me in minutes was already beautiful to begin with. When I returned for my tattoo and she showed me the final design, I was blown away with how amazing it was. She took my idea and turned it into art.

10/10 would recommend June and I would love to get another tattoo from her again. Thanks for a beautiful tattoo and great experience!<//Text>< pics>

Super awesome experience.  I worked with Bailey who is very professional and approachable.  The studio feels more like a salon than a tattoo parlor.  I will be going back to Bailey and June Jung Art for my next piece.<//text>

<text>June is an incredible artist and does beautiful work. I found her when she moved into our neighborhood and after seeing her instagram went in to meet her immediately. She did a small portrait of my dog that turned out incredible! Both June and Rob are friendly and professional, their studio is clean and comfortable, really you can't ask for more as far as the tattooing experience goes - from consultation to the appointment. Thank you June for a tattoo I will always treasure!<//text>< pics>

<Review>June is awesome! I got my first tattoo from her and I  am absolutely in love with it! First, I had my consultation with her and she was able to create a quick sketch of how the tattoo would look like. She took a picture of my shoulder blade so I could get a general idea on how it would look. Then she gave an estimate on how long the tattoo would take timewise. I liked how everything turned out, so I placed the deposit for the tattoo appointment with her. When the day came for my appointment I was a bit nervous, but her studio is really relaxing so my nerves were quickly calmed. My tattoo took about an hour and thirty minutes to complete and I love how detailed she made it. The flower is named diphylleia grayi and it's a special flower that turns transparent when it's wet from rain. She was able to make the flowers look delicate and transparent! Her watercolor skills are amazing too!

My experience at June Jung Art studio was better than I imagined it would be (this was my first tattoo). I got my tattoo done by Beto who blew me away with the amount of time he spent with me to perfect my first tattoo. He spent much time sitting down with me (in person) talking about the design/message I wanted to portray and turned that into a beautiful piece. Rob was also wonderful in scheduling everything and serving as the messenger between me and Beto when I had other ideas prior to my tattoo appointment. I would recommend scheduling a consultation as Beto really took his time, listening to my ideas and mocking up drafts right in front of me. Couldn't be happier with my first.
Also, it's a great location with a lot of open space and natural sunlight. Shoutouts to Rob, June, Griffin, and most importantly Beto for making me feel welcome and guiding me through my first tattoo.< /Text>

<username>John Won< /username><Text>I was looking for a specific style for my tattoo that I designed and came across Beto on instagram. So I made an appointment with him on their website, and their response was quick and friendly.

When I went to my appointment, the place was easy to find. The studio was very clean and quiet. I met both June and Rob as well, and they were extremely kind and easy to talk to.

On to the actual tattoo! Beto was very patient and careful with the work. He was very focused and got all the small details that I had in my design. He made sure to give me time to stretch and get up for a bit (it was a 2 hour session). Also June and Rob gave me suggestions to make the tattoo even better, and it definitely did.

Overall the place was awesome. I would definitely come back for another tattoo. Everyone made the environment very friendly and inviting. I am one happy customer!

This grocery shop is amazing! Everything you need was very easy to find. Affordable prices for all items, groceries, meats, and fresh produce. And also, this place is very conveniently located and the parking area is very spacious. All of the staff as well are always happy and willing to assist you. It was a very good and remarkable experience!< /Review>

Love their salami & kale salad. I ask for extra dressing, salami, and kale, and less of the potatoes (though the potatoes are really good). Decent size salad.</Text>

Western Kosher  is very similar to Western Kosher . I got to admit I like their prepared Food a lot more. Their chicken is amazing if you can get because they quickly sell out. Produce is fresh and brought daily.  Gets very busy so best times to go is when everyone is at work.</review>

<Review>Never too crowded here. You just have to go at the right times. Really good selection on everything considering it's one of the smaller Safeway's I've been to. Closest Safeway to me and provides me with what I want and need. Legit.<//Review>< Date>

First things first, when I originally applied for this agency company I didn't think too much of it since I was employed and always had the means of having two jobs or more apart from my own business. However I was so persistent to find a different job opportunity that I called several times. Yes I admit that sometimes I couldn't get a response but take in mind it's just not me calling its also thousands of other people trying to find the job you also want. Anywho, I got in contact with Marcos and sent him my resume and he said he was going to get back with me as soon as he could. Several days passed by and I got a call from him but stating my current location & the employer he sincerely said it wasn't going to work out. A week or two passed by I heard from him again and he stated that the job offered was a bit closer to me. I went to 2 official interviews plus and phone interview and was immediately hired on the third interview. Like any job you have your ups and downs, regardless he was always there to help no matter how late or early he found out about the situation but he was always present. I have no complaints about him yet and I hope it stays that way. For those that are not lazy and not hopping job to job and seeking a long term opportunity I strongly believe this company has what it takes to take care of you and your future. Just to add a high level remark about Marcos level of professionalism is always on the "T" and has always been honest with me since day one. It didn't matter if I messed up on something he always called or texted to make sure that I was scolded for my wrong doings and that's the way it should be. He didn't beat around the bush or anything, he simply got straight to it immediately. I totally recommend their services to anyone looking for a job and that is hard working.< /review>

<review>I called in to look for work at Great Hire, Marco picked up the phone and after a short conversation about my work experience he told me about a position in Anaheim that’s a 5 minute drive from me.

I have been to a lot of agencies in my past,  but by far Great Hire Staffing has been one of the best. They are very good at reaching out to you when they have good job opportunities. Selina has been very helpful and kind. She makes it easy for one who is looking for employment. She is very professional and is quick to return your call. Thank you for making it easy and not stressful.< /Review>

She always seems to have a smile on her face even if she is under a sea of problems. She has made an impact on my life and even if our paths grow distant I will always be grateful and will remember how much she impacted myself not just professionally but personally as well.<//Review>< pics>

During this pandemic, I have been reaching out to quite a few agencies and did not get any results. It took them quite a while to get back to me, and I was starting to feel discouraged. I decided to reach out to Great Hire in La Mirada, even though it was a little further from my house. Eyleen Sanchez, is AMAZING! She was so helpful, and her kind words really uplifted my spirit during this difficult time. She was encouraging and gave me so many options. Best part, she was RESPONSIVE! I didn't feel like a number to her, I felt like she cared and really want the best for me during this difficult time. Thank you Eyleen, I honestly can't thank you enough!</review>

I called this morning to ask if there was any jobs available and Marco answerd the call. I was very impressed with how he actually listened to what type of work and shift works for me. He asked me a few questions and he told me about a driver/warehouse position that is available that fits perfect with my experience and schedule. He really does try to match you with what fits best! I definitely recommend anyone looking for work to call and ask for Marco!< /text>

<Review>Katalina Minnis takes the time to find the right job that best suits you, she is more than willing to work with you and understand whichever situation is at hand. She never has a attitude and is always kind and genuine. I am now recommending my daughter to Great Hire , knowing she will be in good hands.

This company does not care about its employees, nor does Sr recruiter Marco Rangel!

Client knew my son has cancer when they brought me on all one day missed was pre approved-and two other shift I either came in late and made sure all my duties were completed and one other day I worked left to take my son to the doctors and returned to complete my duties. I missed one day to the flu and client ended my assignment, which I am not even upset about. I’m upset because I can’t get a time frame to pick up my personal belongings and check as Marco doesn’t return calls or text messages and I have to pay for my sons chemo therapy this morning or be rescheduled! This is my sons cancer treatment and I can’t even get a straight answer as to when I can come get my check.

But Marco wasted no time in asking for a positive review!

I NEED MY PAYCHECK NOW!!!!!!!!<//Review>

The Team @ Great Hire is incredible. I've never once had a candidate sent to me that wasn't close to what I was looking for. Worked with them for years and will continue to! 2017 and we're still going strong. Can't say enough great things about Jason and his team....< /text>

It's not within our practice to send candidates on a job interview without explaining the pay rate offered, but it is definitely a possibility that if a job posting is no longer available we attempt to place qualified candidates at another site. Only with your permission and full knowledge of the position though.\nThat being said, In no case would it be acceptable that we took 3 months to issue a pay rate correction. Would you please provide us the date and name of the site that you were at so that we can look into this further?\n\nThank you so much for your feedback....."}</Resp>

A few years ago while working as a temp somewhere else, I applied to a $13/hr position posted by Great Hire and after interviewing with the agency was sent to another interview with the company doing the hiring.

The agency scheduled me for a 4 a.m. appointment (I'm assuming they did this because I was only available before or after my temp job) and to confirm I attempted to call and msg them but didn't get a response. So against my better judgement I went anyway since the company was open 24/7 (according to their website) and to no surprise the hiring manager wasn't there.

Anyway I eventually received a call from that supervisor later that day and he asked if I could come in another time and so I did. As the interview went on I realized that they were only offering $11/hr... So later I called the agency again and asked them why the pay change? And they said, "Sorry the original job post expired so we sent you to this company.." Since I really needed a job at the time I was like fine..

Then two weeks after I finally started working I received my first check and guess what..? It said my pay was $10/Hr.. 😂😂😡😡😩😩 Man I was pissed.. I talked to my boss and he was confused as to why the hiring manager said $11/hr. Anyway he had it changed and gave back pay for the time it took to change it.. (3 months)... Long story short I quit and I'm so glad I did.. the only positive outcome was the work experience and that's looking at the situation in a cup half full point of view.

Hope my experience helps you avoid this situation or if you really need a job I hope this helps you know what to expect.<//Text>

< Review>
If i could leave a zero i would. Anyone working through this shady agency needs to watchout.    They act like they cant contact the actual employer as soon as it gets down to handing you your check. While i was working here there was a few people who were on the job site and didnt get paid until almost a full week after their payday. A person shouldnt have to aruge with people about their pay period, almost 2 weeks later and IM having to make sure i get my check with no help from greathire. Its a shame because some decent companys go through them but with this kind of temp your better off not even working with them. Pay is not a joke if you work your hours you should get your money on time not be talked down to by moody and unhelpfull greathire employees. If you like playing back amd forth games over your pay and having to pay bills late or not all come here. Absolutely never again< /Review>

< review>
Came here specifically for happy hour and walked away impressed. They have a decent sized happy hour menu with pretty good prices. Combine that with free chips and salsa and you can have a meal and a drink here with two people for less than $20. The food was pretty good as well. It might not be authentic Mexican cuisine, but it was good and came out quickly. Service was also friendly, and they have a 15% military discount for those that qualify.</review>

We appreciate their trying to accommodate our request but the food is what is the most important factor in a restaurant experience and I feel they are missing something there.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>

This place is horrible. My husband ordered nachos and one of his chips had a hair cooked onto it.  They  wouldn't take it off the bill at all.  I ordered the Chicken tortilla soup and it was super salty and had a chewy piece of chicken fat or skin in it. They did take that off our bill though.  I also ordered a burrito that came with rice and beans. The beans were horrible.  Not great service or a good experience at all.<//Text>

Food was good, the service was amazing! We had a Kings game to get to, got there with enough time, as long as there weren't any delays. We actually got out much faster than anticipated! Didn't feel rushed, but the server was attentive and efficient. He anticipated our need for the bill and returned with it promptly. Great job!</Text>

But it took too long for our server to actually come greet us after the host sat us, even longer to be given water, and even longer to place our order. After having to repeat our orders multiple times, 2 still came out incorrectly. The server's attitude was calm and friendly, so I'm not sure what the delay was. It was not a busy night, most of the tables were empty. I think even him simply stopping by our table to tell us he is busy and will get to us soon would have been enough.<//text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None< /Response>< GmapID>

<Text>Why anyone would want to go to this Mexican chain restaurant in California which has so many authentic options is beyond me.  I was very unimpressed with the food having gotten a 3-item combo to try a few things out I left most of it behind.  I'd say the food wasn't as nice as the Taco Bell we'd had the previous day.  However the chips and salsa were good as was the service.<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

If your like tortilla soup, this is the best we have found around these parts. We only go here for lunch, so I cannot comment much on the cocktail portion of things here. The food is always fresh and the staff is very friendly and on their game!!!<//Review>

On the Border is chain-style Mexican food that is excellent. They have a very sizable menu with lots of options. I honestly don't believe that I've had a bad menu item here. Chips and salsa are absolutely my favorite of any Mexican themed restaurant. The shredded beef tacos and carnitas tacos are very good. The chicken tinga enchilada is also very tasty. They also have excellent desserts.

This restaurant is always clean and the service excellent. It has a very nice bar area and outdoor seating. The staff is extremely personable. They really make you feel comfortable.

For a chain Mexican themed restaurant, it doesn't get better.</review>

<text>We had really great service. Our waitress was friendley and helpful. She got our drinks right away. We started with a sampler and everything was delicious. The nachos were very 👍. I had a peach iced tea. I will order that again it was refreshing. Our dinner was hot and fresh and delicious.the sour Cream enchilada was 😋. It was a treat. Everything was clean and relaxing inside. We will be going back soon.< /text></record>

Average food and the service was poor for a day when the restaurant was not even half full. On top the check was incorrect. Will avoid next time if I have any other half decent option.< /text>

<Review>Best Tex-Mex food! I've been going to OTB since they opened their first OTB in Dallas back in the 80's. Great happy hour menu. Joe is the Manager, Janell is by far the best server but go early to get her.  Even if they take a favorite off the menu, you can usually still order it. Great sour cream chicken enchiladas, chicken fundido, chile rellenos. Pretty much it's all great.<//Review><date>1570635048681</date>< pics>

<review>Taco Salad that’s all i really wanted, fresh lettuce some beef , olives tomatoes and sour cream and cheese. This is what I got ......cabbage lots of it , 15 small pieces of  romaine and more cabbage red and green 1/2 jar of jalapeño peppers ( no peppers please) ranch dressing that wasn’t good or cold, cold dried up meat ( most certainly yesterday’s) I found a glimmer of shedded cheese and tablespoon of guacamole .
Chips on the side flour , awful. We will not go back .
Then the bill $28.00 so overpriced .</review>< pictures>

Good mexican food, great service. Waiter, sensing  I did not fear hot, brought out a warm green salsa (quite spicy) just for me.

We had a group of 13 people and they handled it great, especially for not taking reservations.  They stayed on our drinks, our food wasn't rushed out or take forever, it was perfect timing to relax, have a couple drinks, & talk before the food came.  Even after we finished our food they didn't rush us out whitch was nice since we were celebrating a birthday so we could open presents.  Will be going back again & again!< /Review>

Excellent service and food! From the waiters and waitresses to the cooks to the management, the entire staff went above and beyond with our requests.

The premises was very clean and the environment inside is lively and friendly as well :)</text>

<Review>Excellent food and AMAZING customer service.  We had dinner there tonight.  Their "Happy Hour" is only in the bar or on the patio.  We had my 10 year old niece and it was over 100° outside, so we sat at a dining room table.  The manager still let us order from the "Happy hour" menu.  Our waiter and the manager were so nice and accommodating.  Definitely one of my new favorite spots, even if it was a little pricey!!< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< GmapID>

If you are expecting gormet food and personal service, this is not the place for you. If you wanna throw back a few drinks and have a decent dinner, here you are. My only complaint is that they allow feral children in the bar area. It's not cute and if they learn some bad words whole in there, that's on the parents.< /text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

I ordered a taco bar from On The Border Order was confirmed 3 different times then 6 minutes after it was supposed to arrive, I call the service and apparently there was a "mix up" with their driver and they left without our order. It was already 15 minutes late at this point and they said it would be another 30 minutes before getting delivered.  Now I have 18 people going to an interview on empty stomachs. Will NOT order from them again.<//review>

It was ok. The chicken was chewy and very little flavor and the server was quite rude. We go here about once a month for lunch and I haven't been very impressed lately. 😒< /Review>

Food was good but our server Sandra was just fantastic and went out of her way to insure our dining experience was excellent which it was !
I asked about the different sauces and before I could ask she had brought out a couple. Somehow she caught on that I liked it spicey and had the cooks in the back make me up something special, THAT'S service. Thank you again Sandra, we we come back we'll be looking for you !< /review>

The food is good but sometimes inconsistent in quality. Not enough to keep me away. It seems that if I go at lunch time, all people are seated in the same general area, which makes it not as enjoyable. I know waiters and waitresses have sections, but parties do need to be spread out a little better. I dont want to hear the conversation of the people directly next to me when the rest of the restaurant is all but empty. The tableside guacamole is excellent but the chips are usually stale and not hot. Hopefully they fix these small issues, I would come more often.</Text>

<text>Went there for lunch a week or so ago. Order the fish tacos was not impressed. Very little fish inside the taco.
My friend order a margarita with her lunch she also was not impressed with it.
Waitress said it was a new bartender.
The wait staff was very nice though.
May go back and try it again, it will be sometime though.< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

I was there in a City I'd never been before for a 2 week training.  My coworker and I looked up places to eat and decided on this one.  Our server was named Sandie and she truly was the best, she treated us exhausted strangers like a friend. She gave us food and drink suggestions which we took and it was the most delicious food and spirits.  So thank you for being the best Mexican food restaurant in Roseville! We'll see you again in 6 weeks!</Text>

The queso here is better than ANYWHERE and the salsa is fresh and delicious. my friend and I always go here and sit at the bar and have chips, salsa and queso plus a couple of drinks and it's a really cheap price for a great time.<//text>

<Text>They do a decent enough job for 4 stars. We love going here for the convience and the top notch kids meal. The chips and salsa are always delicious, but they definitely need salt...they used to salt them nicely, but maybe because we're in California there is some law about salting chips which I'm unaware of (you can put your own salt on, but it's just not the same). The fajitas are good, better than other franchise Mexican restaurants in the area. Good selection of draught Mexican beers too.<//Text>< Rate>

I got the brisket tacos and I love them, but need more than three of them. The wife and daughter were not loving there order superior dinner, no sour cream on it and chimichanga not up to her expectations. The margarita came out with the food and no whipped cream she had asked for. Overall below our expectations, below par from our last visit<//review>

It was ok but they changed the taco salad and no longer make it in a tortilla shell. That was the best part about any taco salad, having it served in the shell. Please go back to the salad in the shell and 5 starts it is.</Review>

Was served "fresh fruit" that had mold on it. Told them and was again served moldy fruit...two more times in a row. Used to like the place well enough for what it is, but doubt I'll be back.< /Text>

Service was poor, felt like we were in their way. We  arrived before 9pm they stop serving at 10. Felt like we were imposing on them. Had to repeatedly asked for things. Bar Drinks were a joke! Full price for a margeritta, served in a  coffee mug.  Food was ok at best, not what they usually serve. Very disappointed with entire visit. Won't recommend, considering all the options in the area for Mexican food.< /Review>

Food is hit and miss all the time! The Mexican employees stare at you like you have done something wrong to them when you're there to just eat food and invest in their business! Margaritas are bad, they don't taste good! Tried this place three times and the food made me sick!<//text>

On the Border has indoor, outdoor and bar area seating. It's similar to Chevys. the service at times can be really good or they could be very short-staffed. The tortilla soup is good in the chili rellenos are good also.<//Review>

We were so upset with our experience here. When we were first seated then asked for drinks, we let the waiter know we had a coupon for the free queso dip. About 10 minutes later we had no chips, salsa, or queso dip when our order was taken. Our entire time waiting we had no drinks or chips even though the waiter passed us multiple times. As our order was taken I asked our server about the half off entrees, he then told me we cant pair that with the free queso we were told to receive and said we would have to pay for it. So we get no queso, and it took an additional 10 minutes before I asked 3 different employees where our chips and salsa were and none of them wanted to help with the excuse of "not my table sorry". I finally asked a manager and right after we got our chips our food was served. We went through our entire meal without a drink refill(we both had huge plates) and only got a drink refill after we had only bites left. None of the employees were genuine besides the manager I spoke to who immediately helped us even though she was busy. I dont know why nobody else wanted to help. I love the food here, but I will never come to this location again.<//review>

Now for the not so great. Had fajitas. I had steak and shrimp and my daughter had a Portobello vegetarian. Good but they weren't great I think I like Chevys better and they don't have tomatillo which is the bomb.  So we had our dinner and I had a coupon for my birthday and they brought us this Sunday. We were eating the Sunday and we had put our fajitas in to go boxes. We were eating the Sunday and my daughter said mom Mom Mom and she pointed to the Box . On the box there was this little black thing and I went to flick it away cuz I thought it was a gnat and she said no Mom. I took a photo with my phone made it  bigger and it was a cockroach .  I was disgusted. We called the waiter and he took the box and was gone for a minute and then the manager came over and apologized and said that she would take my fajitas off the check and she also gave us some border bucks which was $15 . And I mean it was a nice gesture and all , however that was my birthday dinner with my daughter and I was grossed out.  I was just nauseous and yeah so that was my birthday dinner with my daughter and it kind of sucked big time and you know they apologized they they refunded my fajitas and they give us like some extra border cash or whatever but I don't know why, I don't feel that it was enough. my birthday dinner was ruined, kind of sick to my stomach after and I feel like at the very least my whole check should have been wiped clean and they should have given us a little bit more cash or something I don't know what they could have done to make it right but like seriously my birthday dinner was ruined< /review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

They were pretty good visit the food was great staff we're good to light a little busy so preoccupied but all in all it was a pretty good visit I got to say for Mexican food I would recommend them again the price was a little seat though that's why I'm only giving it 3 out of 5 stars but like I said I would recommend it for Mexican food was really good tasty food</Text>

Decent food, terrible service. Went with a party of 6 and every single order was wrong or billed incorrectly. Server's response was "I'll see what my manager can do," rather than offering to comp anything.< /text>

Food isn't bad. It's a little dingy and dark inside, but not in a chic sort of way. A reasonably priced, chain Ameri-Mex food restaurant.</Text>

Meh..just ok. Like any chain restaurant. Food is overpriced and the same every time. Portions are small, Service is ok. Probably won't be back. I'd rather go to a really good Taqueria and pay less.<//Review>

On the Border has a great menu. There are many choices for every diner no matter what type of food where it is protein, vegan, or somewhere in the middle. The staff is friendly as you walk in the door. My food was brought out hot and delicious but the waitress could have visited our table a little more regularly. Guacamole Live is an absolute favorite to have guacamole made the way you like it! Also, there are many wonderful adult beverages to choose from but would have preferred to have drink prices on the menu especially if you budget your meal. Many restaurants around town extend their happy hour menu into the restaurant and not just the bar.  I would love On the Border to offer happy hour in tge dining room as the bar area can get a little busy at times.<//text>

I went in just to order salsa to go. It was $10.71. I gave her a $20 and she came back with all ones. Questions popped in my head like where is the change part, and why would she give me all ones for paper change.. I counted it, it was $8... So she took a tip without me asking or offering.. I looked at her, shook my head and just walked out. Wish my girl was there so she could've confronted her..</Text>< pictures>

(Translated by Google) Good place, on Saturday at 13 o’clock it was crowded, I had to wait until the seats were vacated. The food is delicious, the service is wonderful. While you are waiting for the order, they will bring nachos and sauces to them. Sauces may seem spicy if you're not used to Mexican food. The portions are big! This is unusual when you come from Russia. I ordered a brownie with ice cream for dessert. The ball of ice cream was a big, straight BALL. Somehow ate with my husband.
There are vegetarian dishes.

Неплохое место, в субботу в 13 часов было многолюдно, пришлось подождать, пока освободятся места. Еда вкусная, сервис замечательный. Пока вы ждете заказ - вам принесут начос и соусы к ним. Соусы могут показаться вам острыми, если вы не привыкли к мексиканской еде. Порции большие! Это непривычно, когда ты приезжаешь из России. На десерт заказала брауни с мороженым. Шарик мороженого был большой, прям ШАР. Кое-как доели с мужем.
Есть вегетарианские блюда.</Text>
