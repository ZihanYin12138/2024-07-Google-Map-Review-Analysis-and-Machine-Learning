The tint material is too tier quality.

Installation quality is pristine.

Shop was clean and we'll kept.

They take your time with you to make sure you get what you want, and for me I got better than I wanted, because he showed me the differences between each grade, with the samples on the wall, photos, and in person examples on the lot.

Lots of bonuses during the whole process to make it such a nice experience as well. I'll let you be surprised.

I've seen friends get nice tint jobs at other places and I wouldn't go anywhere else.

Highly recommended.

Even more recommended if you have a Tesla, which requires extra knowledge and expertise, that this shop has.

The warranty and gaurantee are great and the prices are second to none.

They are also dog lovers. C'mon. What else can you ask for?< /Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMyIxoFtZDGLjVDPh3HHTXfHMQLLhL1cQK-K7lH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMvBrmppsySXg4dxB9SzJPJblkSCQ0slfmFQney=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOC7lEhOdfouHpEPJP6BQIkT0GuEDF5VrvwATZU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures><Response>None< /Response><Gmap_id>0x80c3310c6814d5b1:0x5f39c73f7137ab9</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Review>This place is legit. I’ve had them do 2 of my cars so far and they will tint all my future vehicles. Service was great but what really sets them apart is the customer service. I never once felt pressured to upgrade. In fact I was talked into getting the right tint shade for me which was less expensive. If you need tint, this is the place!<//Review></record></dataset><record>

Best customer service, price, and quality for those looking to tint their Teslas. I thought my windshield tint had water stains and I was able to bring my car in on the same day. It turned out to be stains on the outside surface of the windshield, not the tint - the tint is perfect. The owner quickly wiped the stains for me and was patient and informative throughout the time I was there. I cannot recommend this place enough!< /text>

<Review>Incredible job and experience by Sarkis and team. Was recommended by a friend and service was awesome. Sarkis walked through the options and showed us the difference between all the options. We selected Ceramic IR with 50 on fronts and 80 on windshield for our 2021 Tesla Model Y. Vehicle looks incredible. Thank you! Bonus: cleaning supplies to keep our vehicle looking fresh, refreshing drink selection, and just an amazing person in general.</Review><user_name>Justin Hou< /user_name><user_id>108856244429610411744<//user_id><rating>5<//rating>< time>

Sarkis is a legend! I can assure you that there are no other places that offer this level of customer service like what was provided at Acutint! I am more than pleased with my experience! The quality of tinting and the customer service is second to none! Wish I would have known about this place sooner, could have saved a few bucks and got a better tint, installation, and customer service!!! Thank you again Sarkis!</review>

The most professional experience I've ever had at a tint shop. They got all the gadgets to test and determine the tint you need. Afterwards he showed me the difference in temp on his device, unnecessary as the difference is totally noticeable as soon as you get in the car, but still cool. There was even a welcome packet on my center console with window cleaning products and a starbucks card. Customer service is amazing and the quality of work is impressive.< /text>

I have taken several cars and continue to recommend Accutint Pro to all my friends! (Don't forget the"Pro"-otherwise you will be disappointed...) Windshield: 55% visibility is great both day and night. Front: 25% Rear: 18% CXP Ultimate Performance Deal.< /Review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><text>super super friendly, unbeatable attention, aaaand really good price!, I recommended ACUTINTPRO to my boyfriend because I know that it is the best place in the whole extension of the word, they are super professionals, He explains and demonstrates all the benefits that you get with the product that he uses,  and at the end of the whole process you get into your car and you get surprised by a gift, which is really unique and special plus the great attention that this place gives you, makes you feel that you are  in the right place with the people that you will entrust your car with for the next hour or for the duration of the process...

I just love this place and will keep recommending it to my friends and family. Bc is the BEST ♥️< /text>< Pics>

One window had bubbles after 3 years.

Was due to a material defect, not workmanship.

Sarkis, the owner, felt worse than I did about the bubbles, and gave me a Starbucks card.

So refreshing to see people honestly care about their customers.< /Text>< username>

<review>Came in 8 on the dot, the team was ready for me. Opted for the second tier as it gets the job done just as well as the top tier. Left my car in their hands and about 2-3 hours later it was ready before I could finish errands. Upon arriving I was met with a completely different car. All the sloppy work from the previous owner’s tint job was scrapped and reinvented with a sleek look. The team is humble about their work too. It is quite refreshing to not hear someone rant about their subpar work, rather this shop lets their finished product do the talking. All for ~$400, it felt wrong to underpay these men. Tipping is mandatory for such a quality tint job. Cannot thank these men enough for making my day, definitely recommending others.<//review><user>107342465117209407960</user>< gmap_id>

<Text>I have been wanting to get the two door windows, at least tinted on my Audi TT and have been just kicking it around. I got quotes from several shops, so I think overall AcutintPro is at least close. I went in on the spur of the moment and was lucky because they had a cancellation. Sarkis explained very well what my options were and even adjusted my decision to include the Windshield!!! Totally best idea EVER!!  The tint is just right on all three surfaces and the guys were quick, did a fabulous job and the finished product looks oustanding!! Couldn't be happier. I will be taking my other car in to get the entire car done .  Thanks guys  Great work!!</Text><pics>None</pics><response>None<//response>< gmap_id>

<review>Sarkis and his team are the best in the business. I tool my model 3 to get tinted. Sarkis walked me through the entire process, he did not try to rush or upsell me. He made sure I picked the tint that would look best on my car. I am extremely happy with how my car looks. Sarkis is a true professional and a great asset to the community. I will make sure to recommend him to all my friends and family.< /review><UserId.>105854946343005189188<//UserId.><rate>5</rate>< response>

<Review>Sarkis and his team are the best. They went above and beyond, our Infiniti q50 looks amazing! The ultimate package is totally worth it, the car is so much cooler. Can't recommend this place enough.

Update - 3 years later and we just got our Accord and Explorer done. They look great and we love the windshield tint that keeps the car cook without darkening your view. Thanks again!</Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPkyRA1hljhtidnjQsywyaW9jKyUTL7rSCDpy7P=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOP6zr2xaCW0Ww_-kRaLpRexme0RttXooee9Uxg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOQZrtAc_kmApGMX7RToyPhKyd_LRcH_hnbvtlW=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures><Response>None</Response>< GmapID>

These are the reasons why I like small businesses. Sarkis owns and runs it with 2 other guys with super high standards. I was blown away by seeing him "hands on" practically everything. He took the time to explain everything and even showing us the difference of each different type of tints. You can tell he put his heart and soul into every little detail. We've actually upgraded the tint just because we saw the difference. A little more does go great for the long haul. Especially with our ridiculous hot weather. I'll definitely be back with my other cars and would highly recommend him to everyone.<//Text>

One of the friendliest places around Upland. I was walked through the whole process and given a step by step price. Service was done in a few hours (weekday) and an immaculate job. Would recommend to anyone needing a professional level tint.<//text>

Great service! I drove from San Diego to have my windows tinted with Sarkis. He worked with my availability and I'm so thankful! The pricing is more than fair and Sarkis walked me through the process of choosing the right tint for my car. Thank you!<//text>

Extremely helpful, friendly, knowledgeable. Did not to convince me to get something I wasn't looking for, had options. Comfortable lounge, phone charging station, complimentary soda, water and snacks. Bonus surprise when I got into my car...free glass cleaner and cloth. Top notch, I totally recommend this place!</Review>

This is such a great business!! The owner is so friendly and knows what he is doing!! I seriously think this is the best customer service I have ever received. I was referred here by my brother and since then I have had 2 cars done. Also, I referred my husband and father since the service is so great! Don’t even question it, this is the BEST tint shop in Upland, without a doubt!< /Text>

<text>What a great business!  The owner greeted me and was extremely helpful and courteous.  It is worth coming to Upland to see this guy.  He finished my car fast, did a great job and did it for a great price.  It looks like I picked it up at the dealer with the window tinted.... that good!  He even washed my car for me to surprise me because it was my birthday.  I highly recommend coming here. Great service, great product,great price!  Four stars and 2 thumbs up. Also, his dog is there and is a total sweetheart (pretty cool addition).  My dad has been coming to him for close to a decade and we have never had an issue.< /text>< Pics>

<time>1555639348581< /time><Rating>5< /Rating><Review>Today I had my car tinted and I loved it. I scheduled my appointment with Sarkis and he confirmed the via text the day before. When we arrived he gave us some ideas of what tint shade would be best for my car. He also showed us some examples of cars parked outside to better see what each looks like. I ended up getting the Premium Performance: back windows super dark 5%, and medium-dark 25% for the front windows. I’m very pleased with the fast service it was completed in less time than expected. He also provided instructions how to care for the tint and gave us a tint glass cleaner with a cloth. We will definitely be going again to get our second car tinted and I have referred my coworkers as well. Thank you again.< /Review>< Pics>

<Review>We just got 2 of our vehicles tinted yesterday and could not be happier with the results! The customer service was amazing! Sarkis called me back when he said he would, had availability and flexibility for the tint appointments, and overall was a really nice guy! He was also extremely patient with me as I contemplated what level of tint to get. Plus, the fact that they partner with Upland Animal Shelter every year just adds to their amazingness!< /Review>< time>

This place is pretty great. The manager is nice as can be, the service is super quick. And while you wait they give you free soda and candy if you want it. Across the street is a shopping center: Taco bell, key maker, gas station, etc

The only issue with this place is the prices are really high compared to every other place anyone has gone to on our planet. If I tell someone how much it costs, they usually give me 500 window tint places that would have done it for way cheaper(Why they didn't tell me beforehand, I don't know).Besides the price, they're pretty quick, and do a great job.

Right next to the shop is a long set of garages so you'll meet a lot of random people while you wait. Unless you wait inside.</Text>

As window tinting goes, this is as good as I've seen it. Their quality of work is like none other. Besides they make you feel welcome from the minute you step in their  facility.
The manager/owner is very friendly and knowledgeable. He was able to answer all the questions I had and give me a very good price on having my car windows tinted.  I would definitely use them again and refer everyone I know to them.< /review>

<rating>5</rating><text>I was very reluctant to have my car's windows tinted because of all other cars I have seen with bubbles and wrinkles. My car gets extremely hot inside and I didn't want to suffer through another summer so I decided it was time to research a quality tint shop. AccutintPro was nothing less than professional. Owner Sarkis personally guided me through the options, and texted me an appointment confirmation the day before. I didn't want dark, just a medium shade to reduce the heat. I am thrilled with the results.</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

The service was far beyond anything I could have imagined. Not only was the car completed on time, but it was cleaned inside and out. I received a text message with a picture of my car saying it was complete. Then 2 days later, another email saying thank you and that it was now safe to roll down your windows. Great follow through.< /Review>

I had to visit this amazing shop and meet the people who were behind so many five star reviews to see for myself what everyone was buzzing about. The reviews were all true, they are the nicest and most amazing people you would ever want to meet.  The owner  takes his time explaining his service, the various tints, answering questions and treating everyone t as if they were the only important job they had that day!  When they finished my car they vacuumed it and washed it,and it was gorgeous! Kudos to team Acutintpro,, which includes Bambi, for continuing to strive for only 5 star ratings!  You are amazing!< /Text>

I did a lot of research before choosing a place for my car, I was looking for quality tint. I'm glad I chose this place. I originally got the 18% on all 5 windows but after a few days passed I realized it wasn't dark enough for me. So I went back and they added another layer of 18% it's the perfect shade now! I'm so happy with the results. The tint keeps the heat out and has lifetime warranty. The owner is very informative unlike other places that are very short with you and just want your money. I'm very happy with my tint !! :)</Text>

I had been shopping around different places to get my tint done and came Acutintpro on Yelp. So decided to go with them based off the reviews and great customer service. I have no regrets and I absolutely love my tint! I will be referring family and friends, thanks so much!< /review>

I was able to speak with the owner, Sarkis, and he was able to break everything down. The finished product was awesome. I received a text/picture once the tinting was  finished. Then a few days later he called and text to follow up on the finish product. Overall, great experience.</review>

I had great experience with the shop and the service and mostly very happy with my tint the way it came out. The owner was very attentive and made sure the finish product was excellent. Very happy and would highly recommend it so much I wrote a review. I don't write reviews, this one is special.< /text>

2 time customer here. I knew I wanted to go back to Accuprint Pro and not try anywhere else. He even gave me a $60 off deal for being a repeat customer. My car looks wonderful. I will definitely let friends and family know about this place.<//Review>

Sarkis just want to say you have excellent craftsmanship, it shows you do pay attention to detail in the work that you because my white Chevy looks extravagant with the blacked tint you advised me to go with.
I normally do not write reviews but you sir deserve it! I wanted to say i use to go to another tint place before because I would always change my car every year but as the years went by quality went down with my old usual. I will go ahead and tell all who I know to bring their cars to you. Thank you so much again for the welcome you provided me and the great service. We will see you soon my friend!<//Text>

<text>Sarkis does great work!
I went back a week later to ask about some small spots and he made sure to get it taken care of that day. Said he wouldn't feel right if it didn't get done right away, even though it meant pulling the front windshield tint and replacing it.
The true test of a business isn't how they treat you before or even during the job; it's how they treat you after.

<text>I have had my car of over a year now and have two little ones so I have been looking around for a window tint place for awhile now. Finally had the extra cash to get my windows tinted and came across this spot on Yelp. The reviews on this place were nothing but good comments and reviews so I went in with some questions and was able to get  my windows tinted right there and then because they had an opening. It has been going on two weeks that I have had them and I cannot be happier with it. What even top it off is Sarkis text me with a follow up and just fact that he took the time to text me really means a lot. Thank you for everything!</text>< rating>

My sister recommended this place and said the service was great. She was right!!
From the minute I walked in, I was cheerfully greeted by Sarkis, he took his time showing me the various tint options. I was amazed to see the Doggie station with biscuits for people waiting with their pets. Also the basket of snacks and beverages in the cooler for his customers. There's a table with coloring books and crayons for children. Customer service is and was EXEMPLARY!!   I definitely was "WOW'd"!!
Now for the car, WOW!
My car looked absolutely great!!!!
This place is the place! I'm telling everyone!!
Businesses like this, are very hard to find.
Check it out!! You'll agree!!</Review>

Sarkis is very sweet, knowledgeable and patient. He did just as I asked and didn't try to talk me out of my decision, being that it was limo and dark. Very pleased with the finished product. He also just sent me a courtesy text to let me know I can roll my windows down. Definitely recommend this shop. Thank you Sarkis and staff.</review>< Pics>

AcutintPro is the real deal! Sarkis offers some of the best customer service I have ever seen and they stand by their work. He was able to accommodate my car under very short notice and it was still out much faster than expected. The tint is of the highest quality and as we have not seen any bubbles or anything (it's been 5 days). They offer a great value and I can honestly say that they will have my business for many years to come.</Review>

<text>Sarkis and his Team are a cut above. I took my one day old Dodge Journey in and he came right out to meet me hear my needs and then schooled me on the Ohio legality of tint. Since the state highway patrol is notorious for tint tickets he gave me a certificate to keep on the glove box to show I'm legal! Awesome! They washed my car after and I left the shop rolling low profile and freshly pimped. Seriously DON'T GO ANYWHERE ELSE - GO TO THE BEST IN THE BUSINESS. do yourself a favor. Honest. Fair. Human.

Sarkis, the owner made me feel very comfortable and I was extremely satisfied with the tint work his crew did.  The exceptional customer service is on point.

<Review>Well worth the price,  absolutely great work and i love the job they did on my car fast and friendly i was recommended to go here for my tint and i will gladly recommend others as well<//Review></record></dataset><record>
<Text>Price may seem higher than some other places but Sarkis stands by the product and service his shop offers. They have a lifetime warranty with every job included in the price. Any peeling, bubbling, or fading and they will redo it, though that will not happen due to the high quality carbon based material they use. They also give you the manufacturer's warranty, though it is only partial-cost replacement, though still handy if, God forbid it, they go out of business or you move too far to take it back to them. This is not a jack of all trades, master of none shop. They solely focus on window tinting and they are the best at it. Make an appointment ahead of time, and they will have your car, truck, or SUV done within a few hours. They got my little civic sedan done in less than two hours. My car now looks sportier and stays cooler in the sun. I highly recommend this shop for your tint job. Long review, I know, but all this has to be said about this wonderful shop and friendly owner. He even gave me a free bottle of their custom polish as a thanks for our business. At the beginning of this review, I said the price may seem high. But after reading this review, I am sure that you, the reader and prospective customer, see that the price is just right.

UPDATE (7/29/16): I came back to Sarkis and his business to get a visor on my windshield. Before I made my decision, which I thought would be an easy one, he warned me that I had a matrix on my windshield around the rear view mirror. He said this causes bubbling and it may not come out looking the way I want it. I was very glad he was so honest with me and he told me to keep an eye out for other cars with visors and a matrix and see how it looks before I make a decision. He was not all about getting my money, he wanted me happy. Luckily enough, there happened to be a car right next to his shop that had a visor w/ matrix. It did not look nearly as bad as I had imagined and so I had him and his guys go ahead with the job. Very cheap, $40 and I got the limo darkness. Now I have no problem with the sun in my eyes around close to sunset time and it looks fantastic! The 5 star review stands.< /Text>< gmapID>

I have received excellent,  and very professional service from this tint dealer.   I  will not go to any other shop.
Their work is fantastic, and the stand behind their products.  I lije the clear ibstructuobs you are given, and I  appreciate the gifts they give you.  This is a firstrate operation, no need to go anywhere else.< /review>

<Text>I brought my Toyota Camry into Acutintpro really because they were the only tint shop I found open on a Monday.  I'm so glad I did.  I called first and they were waiting for me.  I was able to wait for them to finish.  It did take some time, but I watched what they were doing and they were complete professionals.  After they finished, the owner washed my car.  That has never happened to me before.  I waited to do a review until I had a chance to really examine the job.  It's been over 3 weeks and I can tell you it's perfect.  If you need your windows tinted, you should think about Acutinpro.<//Text>< userid>

Absolutely wonderful experience! My boyfriend took his 2003 Honda Civic in to get his windows tinted and was given back to us looking immaculate! Not only did they take the time to perfectly place the tint on the windows but they also cleaned the inside and scraped off all the sap residue that had fallen on the sides of the car. The owner Sarkis, and his team, not only do fantastic work but also have great customer service. Sarkis makes you feel welcome from the moment you walk in and gives you honest upfront answers on the best type of tint for your cars specific type of window. Though the place is small, and parking lot tiny, the waiting room is very clean and had a play area for the kids as well as snacks and drinks available for waiting guests, free of charge. On occasion, he'll even bring in his dog which I thought was nice as she is very friendly.
If you are going to get your windows tinted, this is the place to go! Wonderful work and exceptional service!</review>

<Review>Sarkis is AMAZING,  I needed a tint the same day and he took care of me right away. I wasn't even aware of the $50 off coupon on Yelp and he even mentioned it to me and gave it to me anyway! He's loyal, honest, treats and takes care of his customers like family. He always puts his customers first and gives nothing but the best. The tint came out absolutely amazing btw! Do NOT go anywhere else, you're not only cheating yourself, but especially your car! I will be sending my family and friends here.< /Review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

Sarkis the gentleman an who helped me was very thorough on the type of tint, shades, packages and details of everything on top of it. Very happy with service and friendly reminders through text messages on how the car was. Even with the questions I had after my experience at AcutintPro he was prompt to respond to my questions.
Location was very close nice, clean, and professional. Even had complementary cold beverages for a warm day.! And was nice enough to give my ride up there one as well too, Which was a great Plus.!

Overall I had a great experience here and would definantly recommend this to friends and family.<//Review><pics>None</pics><Response>None< /Response><Gmap_id>0x80c3310c6814d5b1:0x5f39c73f7137ab9< /Gmap_id></record>

<Review>AMAZING EXPERIENCE!!! I recommend to all of  my friends and family, to come here. I came last year to get my windows tinted, and they came out great, the service was fast and the customer service was friendly. I recently had to come back to get my 2 front tinted windows removed.(fix it ticket) I called for a price, but Sarkis was generous and said he would take them of for free. i had forgotten about the warranty. I took it in the same week. he took them off himself in less than an hour. the wait was great. complimentary drinks and snacks, even a charger bar that has all types of different chargers. I even brought my puppy and he offered her water and a bed to lay in. Bambi was a little jealous, such a sweet  furbaby. Thank you Sarkis for a great service!! 100% satisfied!!!<//Review>< date>

Such a great experience. Sarkis was very helpful and educational. I honestly couldn't make up my mind on the tint shades I wanted, as simple as it may be, but he was very helpful and guided me through the process. He truly treats you like family... I'd gladly recommend Sarkis and Acutint Pro.</Text>

This place is amazing!!! I came here for my Honda three years ago and Sarkis was so personable and made us feel so welcomed and did an amazing job on my honda. Fast forward to 2015, I just purchased a 2012 Mercedes and he did SUCH a great job.   He took my car to the next level ! The inside of his shop has always been inviting (especially with sweet Bambi to welcome you) but he has totally stepped it up inside since the last time I came. Snacks, drinks, a kids corner... ALL COMPLIMENTARY.  He and his team take their time to make sure that you know exactly what you want and are comfortable with the options that you choose. He takes great care of your car and even cleaned it all up for you before you come to pick it up. Thank you for making my car looks beautiful Sarkis!< /Text>

< Review>
Excellent! Above an beyond expectations. I had an Amazon Local voucher so the tint job on front two windows of my Corvette was very cheap. The owner is super friendly, comes out to greet you, shows you different options and recommendations. He even washed the other guys car for him after they finished his tint job! What the heck?! Never saw that happen before! My car was doing super quick, and the owner came to inspect it and show it off to me. Also, he took the time to clean the door panel and spray UV protectant on it as well as cleaned my windshield and side doors from the overspray. The place that tinted it before did none of that. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone and most certainly come back here again. Located just west of Wal-Mart on south side of Foothill.< /Review>

<review>Not only is the product amazing, Sarkis (the owner) and his team deliver customer service that is by far the greatest I have ever received. Owner is amazing! I called day of to see if I could bring my Chevy Sonic in to get tinted and they were able to get it all done within a couple of hours. I wasn't sure which tint I wanted and Sarkis personally helped me figure out what the best option for my car would be. It looks amazing now! The shop texted me to let me know my car was ready and even sent me pictures of the finished product! Then he even shot me an email the next day to let me know that it was okay for me to roll my windows down sooner due to the hot weather. I could not have asked for a better experience.</review>< UserId.>

< Review>
I had been looking on the Internet to find a good place to go tint my car. I soon found acutintpro, and I was really nervous because I wanted to find a legit good place, because a lot of companies tend to do false advertisements, but Acutintpro became a good place I can trust. Since I didn't really know much and found acutintpro on Yelp they gave me $65 off! Usually getting a car tinted would take two hours or more but they only took 1 hour and 20 minutes! Even while you wait they provide snacks, drinks, and even a charging bar for your phones! My car looks amazing and they did such a great job! I'm so in love with how it came out. This is honestly the best place you can go to for a car tint. Sarkis is very helpful and such humble man, you will definitely be glad to go there. Already planning to take my Father and my Sister's car in!< /Review>

<Text>I decided to visit Acutintpro for a quote today, 5/12/16, and Sarkis was more than happy to answer all my questions and was even able to take my car in instantly. They finished right on time and the tint came out beautiful. I will definitely recommend this place and I will bring my future cars here as well. Thank you Sarkis and Acutintpro for the excellent customer service and amazing tint installation.<//Text><userid>111095458599889195298< /userid><gmapID>0x80c3310c6814d5b1:0x5f39c73f7137ab9</gmapID><Rating>5< /Rating><resp>None</resp>< Date>

<Time>1449361406087< /Time><Rating>5<//Rating><text>Let me start by saying that ANYONE working in customer service or who has their own business should go hang out with Sarkis to learn how to do it right. I called at about 10am today, Saturday, and asked if I needed an appointment to have my car done today. Sarkis answered that typically an appointment is best, but he would see what he could do to get my car done for me, since I work a 9-5 Monday - Friday. He called me back about 2 minutes after speaking with him and said that if I brought my car to his shop and gave him a couple hours, he would make sure it got done. Long story short, he provided me the service I needed, for a very reasonable price (especially considering the amazing quality of work) and even THANKED me for bringing my car in and adding more work to his day. THAT is customer service. I will be bringing my next car here, as well as my girlfriend's new car and any friends I can send his way. Thank you again, Sarkis.</text><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

<text>I highly recommend AcutintPro!  My boyfriend has taken two of his cars here for tint so when he offered to have my car windows tinted for my birthday, it was a no brainer to come to AcutintPro.  Sarkis is friendly, welcoming and thoughtful.

If you're worried about forgetting to not roll down the window during the wait time, that won't be an issue here.  They cover the buttons as a reminder not to roll them down and Sarkis will send a text when it is safe to roll them down again.

It was such a great experience and my tint looks AMAZING!!  I HIGHLY recommend AcutintPro!!< /text><username>Tia B</username>< userid>

Sarkis and the crew at Acutintpro do an amazing job with both the tint that they provide and the customer service. Sarkis is passionate about his craft and gives the customer confidence that their investment is of high quality and the benefits are immediately apparent.
The waiting area has a nice charging station setup for various phones and is stocked with complimentary snacks and refreshments.
I will be coming back for my future tints and will be recommending Acutintpro to friends and family.< /review>

Great customer service and attention to detail. The owner is really picky and ensures you get high quality work. After they had finished timting my truck, the owner looked at the finish work and notice so discrepencies on the window tint, he apologized to me for witing longer and had his employee open up a new roll of window tint and had redo my window. He even took me back to my work, picked me up once my truck was ready and even vacummed and washed my truck for that delay. Best customer service ever and high quality work. Will definitely come here again.<//Review>

Got my 2009 Corolla tinted at this shop and went with the Ultimate package which includes all windows sides and rear plus windshield and I am very pleased with the results, the speed of service and the discounted bundle price was not bad at all.  I went with 70 for windshield, 35 front driver and passenger, and 18 rear driver, passenger and rear window and very happy with the transition.  Not too much of a contrast between front and rear, just the perfect combination.  I now enjoy working under the Sun and driving long distance for work.  Barstow, Indio, Twentynine Palms, Temecula the entire Inland Empire....I say "bring it on".  Sarkis you're a good friend and very trustworthy.  Yelp reviews and ratings helped me find your store and I'm glad it was there to guide me.

Sarkis's shop has all kinds of amenities in the lounging/waiting area i.e. free snacks, drinks of all kinds, chargers for different type of phones, play corner for kids, and AC to beat this summer heat.

I highly recommend this place!< /Review>

The waiting area is designed for comfort for both adults and children. I love the loyalty he has for his customers and his beloved companion Bambi. I'm a dog lover and I have great respect for the way Sarkis gave respect and love the his long time friend. Bambi will be missed by all. I strongly recommend  everyone I know to get there tints done at Acutintpro.  You will be amazed at the quality and a very reasonable price.
Thanks again my brotha from anotha motha.< /Review><response>None<//response><username>cynthia jolivet<//username><Gmap_id>0x80c3310c6814d5b1:0x5f39c73f7137ab9< /Gmap_id>< Rating>

Just least a Q50S and after being disappointed with so many tint shops trying to sell me what I didnt want, a good friend of mind told me about this place and about how the owner Sarkis will put your vision to life.

Well, I checked him out and he look like the real deal.  Well all I can say is why did I wasted all that time driving around for??  Sarkis is the King of Tint!   Knew what I wanted and delivered! Thanks Sarkis,  you have a customer for life!< /Text>

This was one of the best experiences I've ever had.  I work for Community Honda in Whittier and had just bought a new Honda Fit the night before.  I went into Acutintpro the next morning and met Sarkis.  Besides the professional job that they did, the personal care I received from Sarkis was wonderful.  I would highly recommend Sarkis and his crew for all your tint work.<//review>

<text>Sarkis runs an incredible business. There are a lot of choices in the area, but none had the reviews that AcutintPro does. Having taken my new SUV to Sarkis, I now see why. I called after business hours to set an appointment and Sarkis picked up right away. He was upbeat and made me feel very appreciated as a customer. This continued when I brought my car in the following day. Sarkis has drinks and snacks available in his shop waiting room. Most importantly, he was very patient while walking me through the tint selection process. I was undecided as to which shade to go with. He brought out each roll of film and held it up to the light so I could get a better feel for each one. He then brought out his tech tools to show me the heat blocking properties of each shade. He never made me feel rushed. Sarkis is passionate about tint, and more importantly, passionate about making sure his customers have a great experience. If you've seen his Instagram account, it goes without saying that the tint job looks incredible. If you're looking to tint your windows, don't look any further. Give Sarkis a call.<//text>< pictures>

<text>Sarkis took my VW wagon to the next level. He provided a great service and price. The tint even comes with a lifetime warranty to back up his excellent work.

I did not think the team at Acutintpro could do anymore when I dropped my car off; however, when I went to pick up my car it was not only fresh looking, but also was cleaned and vacuumed.

Acutintpro is the only place to go. (I never write reviews, but this place deserves it)

Sarkis, thanks for taking my soccer mom car and turning it into a beast!< /text>< Rate>

<user_name>Mulero24<//user_name><review>Went to acutintpro after being referred by my father.. I was looking to get my old tint fixed from another shop that was peeling and they refused to fix it. So i came to see Sarkis. He took the time to look over the car with me and explain the reason the tint was peeling and that he had never seen tint peeling so fast on a new car. After that we went inside so he could tell me about the type of tint they use when they tint. I took my car in this morning to get everything done and, Sarkis had my car finished in about 3 hours he took the old tint off and retinted the whole car. I was very impressed how fast they got my car complete. They even washed and vacuumed my car which is something i didnt expect. Sarkis gave me a really good price to remove the old tint and to apply new tint. I have found my new tint shop that I will bring all my families cars and to referee all my friends there . Thank you Sarkis and acutint for making my car look good again.</review>< Date>

<Review>We had our 2010 VW Jetta tinted.  We drive in AZ quite often and decided to have the clear tint put on the inside of the windsheild, extra cost but worth it when driving into the sun when we are returning to CA.  The owner is up front and doesn't attempt to oversell you and has reasonable pricing.  We shopped around and the best bang for the buck was and is Acutint in Upland.<//Review>< date>

My main concern was night-time clarity. I've had tint on another vehicle that although great in the day time, was very hard to see out of at night.

I expressed my concern to Sarkis and he assured me top clarity at night as well as great UV coverage in the daytime.

My next concern was that I didn't want my tint too dark. I have a black car with a black interior, so any tint would definitely look darker, attracting more "unnecessary" attention by our local 5-0. What he did next surprised me. He actually brought out a few rolls of his film and one by one placed them over my windows so I can see how dark it would be. I definitely got to understand the darkness of my tint.

While waiting at the shop for your tint to be done (won't take too long as he uses the latest in technology to computer cut the film, saving time and providing precision cuts) you'll have the shop dog Bambi keeping you company.

All in all I am extremely satisfied with AcutintPro, Sarkis and their level of service and quality –my BMW looks fantastic! I will definitely go again for my wife's car –the previous shop did a horrible job with horrible film on hers. No doubt this shop will take care of me again.

You didn't hear it from me, but make sure to ask for the "Bambi Discount."</Text>< Time>

I took our one week old, 2015 Toyota Sienna LTD for an estimate.  Sarkis greeted me as soon as I pulled up.  He explained all his tint "levels' and showed me that his "low end" tint was actually the manufacturers midline grade.  He's very accommodating, gave me a great price.  I brought my car back the next day, he estimated about 2.5 hours, but was done in a little under 2.  My car now appears to have factory tint on the front doors, and the 80%, California legal tint on the windshield.

The car was sitting in direct sunlight, and I was able to tell it was not as hot as it normally is inside.  He even used a meter (UV?) to show me how much of a difference the tint up front made against direct sunlight.

I've had my four other cars tinted at shops close by to Acutintpro, and now I know what a real professional place can offer...Thank you Sarkis and your team for an amazing job, my car has been transformed!

Oh, I forgot, my car was handwashed and vacuumed!  The other shop NEVER did that once for the four cars I brought to them!!!< /text>

Sarkis and his team are experts in the tint game. Between myself and immediate family, we've had around 7 cars tinted at various places in Los Angeles county before moving to Rancho Cucamonga.

The experience I had at Acutintpro was absolutely amazing. They set themselves so far apart from the others. Sarkis explained to me the different styles of tint they offer and showed me various cars being worked on which darkness they had so I could get a better idea of what I wanted for my own car. It definitely helped to show me real examples and made my decision a lot easier.

Next, they are BUSY. Why is that important? Well obviously people trust them and I bet that most of their business is based off referrals and repeat customers. Also, when you're busy that means you get lots and lots of practice. These guys have it down to a science.

The most mind blowing about doing business with them is the detailing work they perform after the tint job is complete. Anyone reading this who has never had their windows tinted, window tint is a film (with glue!) that they apply to the INSIDE of the car. You have to spray lots of soapy water on the glass in order to lay out the tint and spread out all the bubbles. This usually makes a big mess and there is always water/soap stains left on your interior. Not at this place. They actually wash the outside of your car and detail the interior! My brand new car with 100 miles on it came out looking better than when the dealship supposedly "prepped" it for me to take it home.

The followup is amazing too. They actually send you a reminder email (if you provide your email address) letting you know it is now safe to roll down your windows.

If your drive is a bit far and you can't have someone pick you up while they work on your car, make sure to set an appointment. They have an air conditioned waiting area with comfortable chairs, snacks, and a refrigerator with sodas, water, and tea at no charge.< /Review>

<review>I CANNOT EXPRESS THAT THE REVIEWS THIS SHOP GETS ARE NOT HYPE IN ANY WAY, SHAPE OR FORM!!!!  And I don't use capitals lightly.

I wish this guy owned a huge company and was making billions of dollars, because he TOTALLY deserves it.  I have NEVER had a customer experience as amazing as what was provided at Acutintpro.

Upon deciding on the shop, I called in, call was immediately answered by the owner, Sarkis, who was kind, patient, genuine, and most important, completely honest with all my questions, concerns and ideas shared.

When I arrived, I was immediately greeted by Sarkis, and his dog Bambi (his PRECIOUS 15 year old corgi-shepard mix dog), and he proceeded to cut pieces of tint from his stock and put them on my windows for real world comparison... WHO DOES THIS?!?!??!

Once I confirmed my choices, my car was taken into his small shop and his installers (who were incredibly good at their job, and insanely professional) quickly got to work.

Although his shop is on the small side, and his 'waiting room' is only 2 chairs, he generously provides free snacks, cold bottled water, and even has a room A/C he will blow directly on his waiting customers.  (I didn't see that mentioned in the other comments, so felt it was a nice and generous touch).

And then... oh man... the PRODUCT... TOP NOTCH product.  I realize it's not 3M, but do your research and tell me HONESTLY this product isn't right up there in quality, function and guaranteed warranty! Besides that, I'm sorry, but the prices that Sarkis charges are ROCK BOTTOM.  I have NEVER found a business where the prices are so low, yet the quality of product and workmanship are SO HIGH!!!!!!

And then the last 'above and beyond' treatment is that Sarkis PERSONALLY washed and vacuumed my car after the installation.  SERIOUSLY?!?!?!?!?!?!  AGAIN, WHO DOES THIS?!?!??!  I wish I wasn't acting so giddy and excited, but I seriously need the world and ENTIRE Southern California area to know about this dude!!

If you are even remotely considering getting your vehicle tinted, PLEASE give Sarkis and Acutintpro (NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH ACCUTINT in Rancho Cucamunga) a call!!!!  You may get other bids, but I guarantee his will be the lowest, and yet the end product CANNOT be beat by anyone else.

What other tint shop in the Inland Empire has won multiple awards for their tinting, been verified and recommended by Chip Foose (from the show "Overhaulin'") and used by Snoop Dogg for his Cadillacs.  NO OTHER SHOP.  END OF STORY.

I almost don't care where I live in the future, I will drive across states to support Acutintpro, Sarkis and his team... they are THAT good, and THAT worth it!!!< /review>< pictures>

<Review>I had my 2000 Celica tinted in 2002 in their old location in Montclair and until this day the tint still looks like new.  I am amazed after over 10 years how exceptional the quality of tint in my car have no bubbles and have not turned purple.  I recently purchased a new car and had them tinted all windows including custom logo design. You can check it out on the Acutintpro facebook page by scrolling down  and look for a 2013 Toyota Corolla with a Coach logo design on the rear glass. I love it! My hats off to Sarkis and of course, Bambi the mascot for having such high standards with the quality of work and customer service.< /Review>< Pictures>

<Date>1370320509175<//Date><rate>5</rate><review>You'll find quite a few tint shops within a mile radius in this area, I drove around, and some of the other facilities were even bigger than this place, but none of them compare to the service I received at acutintpro. It's refreshing to go to businesses these days where you're greeted by the owner - you can tell Sarkis has a lot of experience, and loves what he does. He took the time to explain my options, no hidden fees, he gave me time to think about it, even took me around a completed tint to see how it might look. I wanted my car tinted dark, to keep the heat out but I was worried that I would have a hard time seeing out at night. Just from previous experience, cheap films cause poor visibility, but the high clarity film they use at acutintpro is amazing. They use computer technology to cut the film to fit my windows perfectly, and the cut was so quick. The whole process from beginning to end took only an hour. The lobby is small, but who cares, quality work, and very friendly! and what I appreciated the most when the tint was done, I saw Sarkis inspect every window before handing me the key, and he sincerely thanked me for my business. I love my car, and the clarity is so good, I forget I have tinted windows these days. Thank you acutintpro!</review>< pictures>

Went there two times really bad service I went and waited  20 min for a quesadilla they called the ticket number I ask if it was a quesadilla she totally ignore and repeated the number I ask again is it a quesadilla she said I have various orders with a quesadilla (attitude)and repeated the number again  I told her what I order for her to able to tell me if it was my order, such a bad experience never coming back and the one lady taking orders same bad attitude we ask for suadero tacos and she just moved her head and said no I mean at least say we out of that meat or something she just said no 👎🏼</review>

Located off the side of a busy road on a gasoline station, Tacos el Pollo y el Pollito is one of the best places to get a great and quick Mexican meal! They have the best Quesadillas made from handmade tortillas! They are juicy and great! They fill you up and are worth your money! I definitely recommend Tacos el pollo y el Pollito! Las quesadillas son las mejores!!!< /text>

<text>Tacos here are really good. Almost as good as the ones my mom makes. I hate that almost always they run out of chicken super early. The lady that takes your order definitely needs some training in customer service. She never smiles, she's never polite, and if you ask how much longer for your order to be ready, she gives you the nastiest attitude possible them turns to talk bad about you to the guy that makes the food. This spot can easily be a 4.5 stars but because she is so rude they only get 1 star.< /text><time>1573365392084</time><Rating>1</Rating></record>

Great food at affordable price. Prepare to eat standing up. Drinks are sold by the gas station. Service is a hit or miss (depends on their mood) but the food never disappoints.< /review>

I really want to give it only four stars because my burrito was expensive and I am a cheap s.o.b but the buritto was so good, I could bring myself to knock it down a star. The place is legit and worth a visit. Just an FYI... It is a small food truck parked in the Shell gas station parking lot. Google maps leads you down the road about a half mile away in the wrong direction.</Text>

<Text>I feel horrible for this review because I don't like to talk mean about small business but it is what it is. The lady is RUDE, personally me I dont go back to a place like this and I'm an all smile second chance  kinda girl but when I spend money somewhere at least great costumes with a smile 😊 and burritos $9 for a small tortilla? And tacos soooo dry and no flavor, salsa was good but I wont go there Nope not again, not ever, not today or tomorrow. Sorry but I hope you apriciate my review and learn from it.<//Text>< Pics>

<Text>Maybe got an off night or because it was to go.  The pastor quesadilla was a bit dry and not much cheese.  The lady that help was nice.  A bit strange that they don't list a price anywhere.   Just for FYI I got my quesadilla for $9.</Text><user>112155090659074223281</user><user_name>Scott Chau<//user_name>< response>

They like to waste your time. Called to find out if they take snowboards the man on phone said yes bring them down. Got inside for them to say no we don’t as one guy shoved a sandwich down his face.  Super rude as well. Should not be on the list of best pawn shops in LB.</Review>

I bought a really Nice Canon DLSR  Rebel T5i from Alberts Jewelry and Loan on Facebook Market Place. It was shipped right out to Las Vegas in perfect condition, exactly as described. Any questions I had were replied to very fast with Messenger. Packed perfect so no damage would occur.<//Review>

<Text>I had a great buying experience everything came on time and as described. They Evan called me all the way in IN to make sure I got the shipping I wanted and they called to make sure I got my package when it arrived. Out Standing customer service will most definitely be shopping with them again. I’ll give them an 10/10.< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><gmapID>0x80dd3144110a072f:0x4e1f75257ed63f3a</gmapID></record>

<text>I purchased a MacBook Pro from Boris after seeing his ad on Facebook Market. The MacBook is amazing, it came with tons of software programs and Boris was helpful and answered all our questions. He is very respectful and knowledgeable about the computer software. I would recommend his shop to anyone looking for a laptop.</text><resp>None</resp><Time>1618721744454<//Time>< user>

I saw Boris’s ads on Offerup and bought the nicest MacBook Pro money can buy! His prices are great and he is a man of his word.
Reliable, considerate, and very knowledgeable with his electronics!

I ended up having an issue with my device and he followed up with me and gave clear instructIons on how to resolve the matter. I would recommend his services to anyone!<//Review>

Dealing with the folks at Albert Jewelry & Loan is terrific! I made a major purchase online from them and they immediately sent me the UPS shipping notice! My purchase arrived today and the entire experience was great!</Text>

You get a fair amount for u Gold but is the same price for pawn or sale.. So I rather pawn my belongings and get it back in less then 3 months .. The staff are helpful and always answer any question .

I'm giving it 3 star 'cause the advertising outside the business said. " 24 Hrs Open 7 days" and is my 2 time coming on Saturday around 7:30 pm  and is closed ..

I think will be nice to change the ad and have the schedule visible by the door or window .</review>

absolutely One if the best experiences

I saw Boris's ad on the Facebook marketplace for the latest model sealed brand new MacBook pro-16inch 8corei9 32gb ram beast...   Foremost, Boris replied right away and in person was friendly and very informative and concise with the product ...   Moreover, one of the main reason I purchased from him is because I just couldn't justify Apple's huge price tag for the same model in which Boris sold to me for over $600 LESS than Apple, plus the couple hundreds of dollars in taxes I saved ...< /text>

< review>
I just went in to sell my brand new lap top and he offered me 45$ 😂 the busted models they had on display were priced at 175+! He said your laptop doesn’t have a disc drive, (I didn’t mention I had an attachment for discs at home because at this point I didn’t even want to do business with him)90% of models these days don’t have disc drives ! Then he tried to use the manufacturer date as a reason. Knowing I just bought this Lenovo laptop less than 6 months ago at Best Buy for over 200$ after tax (sale price), I was not about to accept 45$. Anyway I have gotten offers on the letgo app for at least 100 or more. Don’t waste your time here. This place is for desperate people obviously.<//review>

They are LIARS AND CROOKS. They sold me a broken bass on ebay. Nice size chunk broken off the head... It costs $150 to repair. Boris says "Oh, don't worry, we will take care of you", so I have the item repaired. They pay me only $100. I am out of $50 dollars. Do yourself a favor - stay as far away as you can from those thieves and liars. Do not believe a single word they tell you. Expect to be swindled, lied to and set up.<//Review>

<Rating>1</Rating><review>DO NOT BUY!!!!! All of the negative reviews of this place are correct . i recently sold a Ebay item to this individual and he tried to rip me off stating that it didnt work and blah blah blah. Bottom line he would have kept it if I credited him pretty much the entire amount of the sale to his Paypal. This place has alot of negative reviews and alot of individuals that have been taken advantage of do not let that be you. This place  needs to be shutdown.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

Used AeraTrip to book a JFK -DEL ticket. The service was very efficient. The price on the website was honored. No gimmicks. The response time was phenomenal and the staff very friendly and courteous. Ajay was very helpful in getting the tickets. Would recommend them for your ticketing needs.<//review>

Flight booking experience with AeraTrip was nice. AeraTrip really delivered a comfortable and hassle free experience during the flight booking. They know their job and respond within minutes, and are eager to find the best possible option. Ajay really outperformed his duties during this booking and was able to deliver on a nice consumer experience promise.</Review>

<review>I had always booked my flight tickets on my own but this time there were a lot of things to consider before the booking, so i just explained them the situation and they managed to find the best solution for me. I may sound like a paid review but seriously they made my flight booking a lot easier,  Definitely the best agent in this business. Will definitely contact them next time.</review><pictures>None< /pictures><gmap_id>0x80c2eab71d2c8179:0x9c0bcad9588c5b8a<//gmap_id><user>106566040313686945739</user>< Resp>

The best part is that we worked with a guy name Sajan. Five starts to his service he provided. Very proactive,  listened carefully , helped and found good deals , quick follow up and worked with us till the end. Thank you Sajan!!</Review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

The experience is good. They help you with all the options available and provide clarity on all the aspects. I would not say I got the best deal. But it was as good a deal as anyone else.
They just made sure I had all my questions answered before I book the ticket.
Hope my journey is as smooth as the booking process.< /Review>

<Review>We have made several international flight reservations with AeraTrip and have consistently received excellent service. They try hard to find fares lower than those on airline websites. We have been able to work with the same agent (Sankalp) every time and he makes our experience easy.</Review>< gmapID>

I had a complicated itinerary with unchangeable dates. AeraTrip customer service agents listened to all my requirements and gave me the best options to consider. Their response turn over time is also amazing. I would definitely recommend this agency to all my friends who wish to travel to India.<//Text>

I would say this AeraTrip was the best travel agent I have come across to date.  Over the past 10 years, I have dealt with many travel agents, however, this past week was the first time I went through AeraTrip.  Their service was prompt and to the point.  They were very attentive to what I wanted and provided me quick service.  They also answered all of my questions to my satisfaction.  I would definitely recommend AeraTrip to Others and would definitely use them again in the near future.<//text>

Ray Mak is simply AWESOME. Best customer service ever!  He was able to get me great rates with a good airline in no time at all.  He even called me several times to make sure that I am all set and gave me some helpful travel tips.  I would definitely go back to him for my future travels.  I highly recommend AeraTrip, you will not be disapointed at all.</text>

<Review>I would highly recommend this travel-agent / site, they are dedicated and try their best to provide you lowest price with confirm seat. The only reason I put 4-star instead of 5-star, there is a space to improve the professionalism for some online agent, I am very much pleased specially agent "Sajan" how he handle his customer, give space to customer to think and decide and explore other options...keep it up guys</Review>< userid>

I had an excellent experience with AeraTrip. Sajan was very professional and expertly guided me when I was initially looking for competitive fares and dates. Just recently Lufthansa cancelled and rescheduled some flights which affected my travel dates. Once I discussed this with Sajan at AeraTrip, not only was he understanding but he professionally coordinated this change with Lufthansa. I will highly recommend AeraTrip for your travel needs!</review>

Great options to book flights at reasonable rates. Representatives are available around the clock, which makes it very much convenient to get tickets booked anytime during the day. I would like to say special thanks and appreciate "Sajan Mandal" who has always been very helpful and courteous in providing the best deals. He puts in so much effort and time with you so that you get the great flights at fair prices. Whenever you need his help, he will go an extra edge to get the best deals. I would recommend Aera Trip to everyone!!<//Text>

<user_name>Ashutosh Gupta<//user_name><date>1463724564714</date><rate>5</rate><Review>They are really very good and know what they are doing.
They are booking tickets for me and my lot of friends who are travelling across the globe and never had a single issue with them. Moreover they give best rates and service which I had never experience with anyone else.
I chose one provider before them but they did fraud with me and took money and gave me a ticket which was booked using stolen card and I couldnt travel. Since then I am only going with these guys
But when I contacted them, they  gave a  lot of options to chose for new tickets with very good price. And I travelled next day. And they are very reliable.

One most important thing that they have support \ sales available 24 x7 every day, NO HOLIDAY( neither in US nor India) and separate number for India and US too(No need to call US number from India). And recently added online chat which is always ONLINE which I preferred most when I need to book the ticket because I can ask for multiple options and more details on chat itself.< /Review>< Pics>

I with my wife taken a trip of 4N 5D to andaman and Nicobar island from 29th October to 2nd November 2018 through Aeratrip. Package was competitive but facilities not provided as per itenary. As per itenary hotel to be provided 2 star but at port Blair it's a lodge namely Myisland Residency which does not have lift facilities and small restaurant having limited items. After complaining not changed. As per itenary premium or luxury Cruise ticket for to and fro from port Blair to Havelock to be provided but I got economy ticket. So they are not fulfilling as per itenary.

What an amazing service. I just read about AeraTrip on Quora and thought of just submitting my contact details and itinerary plans and within a short time i got my draft itinerary from Ajay. I requested him to make change by shifting it one day before and he sent me updated itinerary again. I wanted a similar itinerary and i couldnt find it out on internet and i got it in a good price. Payment is also done on your credit card so no chances of fraud etc. I recommend AeraTrip to my friends and readers of this review.</Review>

Ajay Dangi, the travel agent who helped me with this booking was really pleasant talking to.Unlike some of the other agents I interacted before, he did not try to just sell me the ticket mindlessly. He was very understanding, friendly and got me a good deal. The ticket I purchased was at least $ 200 cheaper than the other quotes I received. Overall my experience with Aeratrip was pleasant. Looking forward to working with them in future.<//review>< Rating>

<Text>I booked tickets through Aeratrip several times. Everytime the service was outstanding!

Sajan, Sankalp and team are always available to talk to, provide you competitive prices and accommodate your travel needs. They go the extra mile to meet the customer's expectations and make sure they have a pleasant experience. I changed my itinerary after booking and Sajan made sure everything was right even though it was very late in the night.

Booking a trip to India was always stressful till I found Aeratrip! I would highly recommend them for booking your next trip.< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None< /resp><GmapID>0x80c2eab71d2c8179:0x9c0bcad9588c5b8a< /GmapID></record>

<Review>Excellent Customer Service and the best knowledgeable staff.  One of the finest travel agents who will go an extra mile to ensure you get the best offer/deal and make it sound so simple and not show how much extra effort is required to do so. And the challenge is you can never find the same price or deal anywhere in the internet. This probably was my 5th time booking with AeraTrip and Sajan and Sankalp have always made it the best and most economical trip for me and my family. I will surely recommend them and a big shout for Sajan today. Sajan was extremely patient in handling my request, and worked extra hours just to ensure I get the best possible fare for my travel. Thank you very much. You guys are the best.</Review><Response>None<//Response><rating>5</rating><Pictures>None< /Pictures><user_id>108195577490981140982</user_id><gmapID>0x80c2eab71d2c8179:0x9c0bcad9588c5b8a</gmapID>< time>

I would appreciate his time and help and I would definitely recommend him to work with.

-Vinai.

I worked with Sajan Mandal recently on one of my booking. Sajan helped me find a cheapest quote on Emirates airlines. It was great working with him, his response was quick all the time. I would definitely recommend working with him and i look forward to work with him again.

Thanks,
Vinay.< /Review><Gmap_id>0x80c2eab71d2c8179:0x9c0bcad9588c5b8a<//Gmap_id><user_id>111135582028809440834<//user_id></record>

I worked with Sami to find a car. He helped me on 2 different occasions and recommended a bank to get a loan and finish the purchase. He explained everything well and made this process easy and painless. Thank you Sami. I’d recommend to check out their inventory and ask for him.< /text>

I had a really good experience at ZAS Motors. Thomas and Maria were very helpful and truly made us have a great experience. The whole staff helped us out and made us feel very comfortable. We would definitely purchase another car from them and highly recommend them to anyone looking to purchase a used car! 10/10! Definitely go and check out the variety of cars they have!< /review>

I had a great experience with Zas Motors.  Sami and Thomas were a pleasure to deal with.  After talking to Sami & Thomas a couple pf times I drove almost 3 hours to see the car I found on their website.  They were very honest, friendly, and didn't pressure me at all.  I took the car for a test drive and decided to buy it on the spot.  I would highly recommend Zas Motors to anyone who is looking for a place that understands the meaning of the word Customer Service.<//Review>

Had to come back and change my review as unfortunately I was sold a lemon by this company, In march I had purchased a 2015 wrx base from this company with a 4 month 4 thousand mile warranty. Not 100 miles into ownership the throw out bearing goes out in the clutch, which destroyed the clutch plate and assembly. This ended up costing me $600 out of pocket and I struggled to get the manager to help me cover repairs of which only parts were covered in the end as according to him this happened due to my inexperience and the warranty I had been told would help with these repairs would actually not.(Been driving manual over 10 years at this time and have not had a clutch go up to this point). Not long after the front wheel hub assembly went out and is now costing me an additional $500 in repairs on top of the $600 I paid for the clutch and the $600 I paid for new tires that were bald when the car was dropped off to me. As these issues were experienced so suddenly in my ownership of the vehicle its hard to believe that the claim that it was sold in good faith to me after 150 inspection is accurate...major dissapointment.

For a vehicle I have not put 2000 miles on or had a chance to have fun with this was extremely beguiling to me. What was genuine excitment over a new to me vehicle, was quickly soured thanks to the lack of supportby Zas motorsports. I would never buy anything more expensive then a lawnmower from them unless you are prepared to spend a grip of extra money. A genuine group of scammers.</Review>

The warranty we gave you was a complimentary warranty for 4 months 4000 miles, it was free of charge, it only covers power train, which is Major parts on the car not your maintenance parts.\n\nThank you for helping and supporting a small business in your community by being so supportive and helpful. We wish you all the best with your car which is a great car with a great value."}</resp><gmapID>0x80d9515ad7c1347d:0x196cfee7018ef5b1< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Many people know how stressful it is buying a vehicle and that you always have to be on alert when dealing with car salesman but Thomas made my car buying experience very easy. I was greeted at the door generously and got a great deal on a car for my wife. I highly recommend zas motors< /Review>

I just want to share what a fantastic experience I had buying my Honda civic from Zas motors. Tomas and Zamir are great guys there was no pressure to buy and any issues I found with the car was immediately taken care of.They offer a great warranty also for a fair price. I have had the car a week and no issues , I would definitely recommend them to anyone who seeks a quality used vehicle.Keep up the excellent work you guys and thanks again .<//Text>

I literately called and made an offer on a car and was told I’d be called back in two hours in order to start the process. I already had the money, the car picked out, and insurance. The woman NEVER called me back. I’m baffled. What a terrible, terrible company. I’m glad I didn’t waste $7000 with them.< /Text>

<Time>1602574941006<//Time><Review>This review is long over due. I purchased an 04 Acura TSX back in January and the car has not gave me any issues yet (it’s been 5 months).
Since then I’ve been modifying my car and making it unique to me but I couldn’t have done it without the amazing team at ZAS for offering me a great deal and being honest salesmen.
Being the first car I’ve purchased, I was very nervous that I might get scammed or tricked into buying a car which had issues, but this was not the case.
Out of all the dealerships I visited, ZAS Motors was the most friendly, trusting, and honest. I felt no pressure at all while I was there.
I will continue recommending ZAS to anyone looking to buy a car.
Thank you!

<Review>Thomas did a great job helping me buy a truck. Between usaa and Zas, I was in and out with the truck I was looking for in no time flat. Thomas was super helpful and I got a good deal on my trade in. I was a little hesitant to go to a mom and pop car dealership, but I did my research on them and the experience was worth it. I would definitely buy a car from them again. Thanks Zas!</Review><pics>None< /pics><Response>None< /Response>< Gmap_id>

I came to this place in search of my first car,  best decision I made. Masir was very kind and reasoning with me. I don’t have the best credit, so when he went to try and find someone who would finance me, we didn’t have much luck when trying to find the best deal for both of us. I initially wanted to put down as much of a deposit as I could so I could have a lower monthly payment. But the way my credit is set up it wasn’t working out(lol). So when he decided to take a chance & finance me his self I couldn’t believe it. He offered me 0% APR, yes my monthly payment was a bit higher then I wanted but it was the best decision I EVER made. I knocked out all my payments in SEVEN months!! And now I OWN my car. Thanks guys!  Definitely recommend going here & checking them out. Will definitely return as a customer when the time comes.<//Review>

Marcus was very helpful and showed me what he had and what would soon be available. Decided after looking at the lot that I would not look elsewhere, I could find a good deal here. The second day I went in they had a Lexus sitting on the lot that was not there before. After driving it, decided this was the car. They accepted my offer (below their list) and I went home happy. Within the first three days my driver window stopped working and the battery died!! But wait, No Problem!! They fixed/replaced both!! Happy with the car, the service, and
the people.</review>< pictures>

I just bought my first car at ZAS motors in Lemon Grove yesterday. Everything was done super quick and convenient. The owner was very understanding and comfortable to work with. I would recommend my friends to buy a used car at this place if they ever wanted to buy one.</review>

<pictures>None< /pictures><username>Nicole Sisti</username><text>I bought a 2009 Toyota Corolla from Zas back in September 2017. Well it's been about 4 months and 4,000 miles. I am very pleased with my car and the price I paid for it. I was very glad to find Zas because the car I got was less than the lowest priced cars you can find at a franchised dealership, but it's a great car and in great condition. And I was not pressured - I found the car I wanted online and was never pushed to get a more expensive one. In fact, I was paying about 15% of the car myself, and using a loan for the rest - and they actually forgot to collect the payment from me when I drove it off the lot. If they were only about making tons of money off of every sale, I think they would have remembered that part! My only 'complaint' is that they forgot to reset the maintenance light when the did the oil change. I had to google how to do it myself, took 10 minutes total.<//text><resp>None</resp>< Date>

< review>
I am blown away by the service i've gotten at Zas motors, esp from AK.

I bought the car, had issues with finance company, due to my credit, wanting more info, even though id already taken the car home. This made me feel car was not yet mine. Zas agreed it was an inconvenience and offered me a free oil change & detail at a time of my choosing, what? Yep cool move by them, and totally unexpected!

Furthermore when i realized the front right tire had a very slow leak, they had me come in and put a new tire on, without me having to ask.

When i bought the car there was a slight issue with sunroof nor opening properly. They assured me i could make an appt at a date of my choosing and they'd fix it. When i came into get the new tire, they fixed the sunroof as well. I'm now rolling in my new hybrid and couldn't be happier.

Car drives amazing, they worked hard to get me financing at best rate they could, and have already shown a dedication to excellent customer service, as stated above.

We've all got our horror stories, from buying used cars, this has been the polar opposite. Its a great feeling to know, there are honest used car salesman out there. So if looking for a good, fair deal, from an honest company, look no further than Zas motors.

And on top of all this they are really nice guys! I'll recommend anyone i know to these guys, without reservation. Thankyou AK & Zas motors!< /review>

HAVE YOUR CAR CHECKED!!!!!
I bought a car from this place about a month ago and regret it. The only positive aspect was the one salesman that was friendly. The vehicle I wanted had a couple dings and bruises but nothing I couldn't get fixed myself. After turning the vehicle into a licensed technician to do an alignment I found out and seen for myself that the after removing a couple things there was over $2000 of work that it needed. The Technician then deemed the vehicle unsafe to drive. *For future buyers* Take you vehicle straight to a qualified technician for all checks before buying from this establishment! Don't take their word for it.<//review>

<Review>Zas Motors is one of the very few exceptional used car dealers in the San Diego area. I know because I went to at least 10 different used car dealers before purchasing my car from them. This was my first time purchasing a used vehicle ever in my life and I can honestly say Zas Motors not only met all of my criteria but exceeded my expectations. Zas Motors is honest, hard working, fair, and the most genuine people I have been able to find in the business.
The vehicle I purchased from them is the exact vehicle I have scoured the internet and local areas in search of for the last 4 months. I took the vehicle to Midas for a pre-purchase inspection and the car came back with a great report. Midas only recommended changing the brake rotor on one of the front wheels due to normal wear over time. After showing Masir, of Zas Motors, Midas’ report, Masir replaced the brake rotors and brake pads on both front tires free of charge. They also stayed true to their original deal of the price of the vehicle that was negotiated the day prior, and let me just say that I negotiated a great deal. Truly stand up dealers. The vehicle has proven to be reliable, economic and of great value.
This was one of the best purchasing experiences I’ve had and I feel as though I made some friends in the process. Ask them where they are from and let them tell you a little about their history. You won’t regret it and it will make your car buying experience that much more enjoyable. These guys have literally risked their lives to be where they are at today, saving US American’s lives in the process.
Coming to a fair agreement on a vehicle you’re interested in purchasing from Zas Motors will not only leave you satisfied as a customer but will leave you feeling appreciative of their business, respecting of their commitment to their customers, and genuinely happy to see people who have risked so much, deserving of so much more, make a fair and honest living for a chance at a better life here in San Diego.

Wow!!!!!Honesty, Great Customer service and great deal !

It was incredibly a great experience purchasing a car from this dealership. Zamir Sultani is a great and a professional salesman I have ever met. He is very friendly and take care of his customers very well.  He treats customers with smile and explain everything clearly about the cars, price and paperwork. Overall, they know how to do business and make customers happy by offering great deals. Their price is really good comparing to other dealers in the market. I purchased a nice car from them and I got a great deal with a saving of at least $700 plus  great quality. I visited several car dealerships in San Diego, but I couldn't find such a good deal with nice a car.  I recommend this dealership for anybody who is looking for a reliable car and great experience. Thank Ms. Zamir, I hope you go very far in your business.<//review>

<Review>It's been about a year since I bought a Honda Fit for my fiancé (now wife) and we love it ! Zamir was gracious kind and worked with us every step of the way. He came off as a very family oriented man and was honest with us from the get go about prices , about the benefits and good things about different cars and about the bad things. We didn't buy a brand new car. But for the price I feel like I did. They provided all the details about the work on the car and when we got it everybody was amazed at the quality and the great deal we got. I held off for a long time on giving a review and I hope this doesn't sound fake it's just I had a negative experience buying a car before but with zamir I had a great experience and we love the car and the price we got ! So keep it up!< /Review><Response>None< /Response><pics>None< /pics>< date>

I bought a 6.5 year old prius from Zas for below bluebook!  It also included new tires, brakes and oil change.  Though the car was purchased "As Is"  Zas provided 3 forms of proof that the car was genuine; i.e. not a salvage title, clean CarFax, and a single owner vehicle that had lived its entire Life within the area.  Not to mention the free used Thule rack still on the car!!< /text>

<Response>None< /Response><Text>I normally don't review car dealerships but I felt this one was necessary.

Let me start off by saying that my overall personal interaction with the salesperson working was pleasant, not pushy, and relatively transparent.

I feel the salesman wasn't familiar with Jeep's which I can understand, it's hard to know every car make and model front to back, so I don't discredit his efforts. He was generally very nice and pleasant.

My complaint with this company is they're selling this particular 10+ year old Jeep Wrangler Sahara for  $4k-$6k more than the blue book priced value.

The other issues above this ^ are as follows:

Upon inspecting the vehicle, the appearance is polished which I can tell they made this car appealing to the buyer. However, it quickly became a smoke and mirror situation.

Popped the hood and the radiator cap was missing.
Red flag.
The back seats were also removed from this vehicle, which the salesperson did offer to go to the Junk yard and find some for me.

The car sounded like it was idling ok.
The aftermarket off-roading tires were at 40% tread which for me, would be an additional $600+ to replace them, you cannot just buy 2 tires on a 4-wheeling vehicle. Another expense.

The car seems to ride ok, whoever had it before made the differential much More dramatic for crawling, so the steering was extremely loose even on city roads.

Took this baby on the freeway to see how she did, I had to flinstone my foot to the ground to even get it to go above 60mph, took time and effort. Then the entire car began shaking tremendously, it felt like it was going to fall apart. Yes, that's an exaggeration but it was pretty bad.

The car then coming to a stop, I had to slam all my energy into the breaks to get it to stop, meaning the breaks had a malfunction or have not been refreshed for resale.

After this scary test drive, I then drop it off at the lot where I went to roll up the driver side window. Which, would to my surprise not roll up.

The lot assistant said he informed his tech guy and that there's a way to get it up but it's a sweet spot.
I drove by this morning, that window is still down (I live a few blocks away).

The reason why I'm going into detail is because Had I not known what to look for, I may have purchased what appeared to be a cool great car, and then been  stuck with a 10 year old car that needs constant upgrades and repairs.

This car also says " CLEAN TITLE" but when you review the car auto report it has had structural damage twice which means, no! It's likely a salvaged title.

To anyone who is young or inexperienced with purchasing cars. Please take someone with you who can look out for these things, I've made this mistake as a kid and don't want someone to be sold a car that's not worth it's value like this. Good luck.<//Text><name>Moore Fitness</name><UserId.>105136467200442375755< /UserId.></record></dataset><record>

<text>Passing through from Nevada. First time and it was on Thanksgiving evening. Although they ran out of a few items which is to be expected considering the day and time that I arrived. Still got to have turkey and dressing. Thank you for saving the day. Enjoyed my food and service. It did not take long at this location as it did at the other Fresno location. Will be back< /text>< pictures>

Worst experience ever. Couldn't believe the food I got and that someone could even send it out. Not even edible. Out of Sweet potatoes & Mac n cheese at 4pm on a Sunday. Let me guess Covid???< /review>

We went to this place this one time, we looked for it because the other Boston was close for renovations, You could not see that you could go in to order, good it had a drive through, I was ordering and asking for mix vegetables and add corn and the person taking order told me that would be another side dish, I said no gust mix for in my vegetables, then my dark meat chicken I wanted 3 piece, and for some reason he kept trying to give me a half dark meat, then our order hardly no vegetables, couldn't get hot sauce, or barbeque sauce!!! Not happy camper!!<//text>

<Review>From Socal and was craving me some Boston Market. Mainly their rotisserie chicken with this sweet chili sauce. And something I would never have liked until Boston, their corn. Which down south I'm used to their garlic seasoned and medley seasoning corn. So delicious!
But just not here. Chicken, no signature tasty sauce, nopejust plain BBQ. Corn, just slightly buttered, good temperature. Come on guys, are you Boston Market, or the plain, ordinary, generic restaurant? Otherwise take off the Boston and replace with 'just plain restaurant market'. I'll try you again in a few weeks. I'm rooting for you guys.
Thank you!</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None</resp><GmapID>0x809442bbb83ebb4d:0xa3a91c308b9b14df<//GmapID></record>

They messed up our order, but they do not answer the phone so there is no way to correct our order without driving to the restaurant. We submitted a question online with no reply.
2/14/21 - So will I receive a refund for the food I ordered that was not delivered? That would be the first thing to do if you were actually going to work on correcting the issue.</Review>

<text>You know when they give you your receipt and the cashier says "at the bottom there's a number for a survey, if you could please do that for us we would really appreciate it", and you say "yeah sure", and then the receipt Finds Its way in the bag when you're done eating and in the trash. Well, this place was so good in customer service and quality of food that I actually took the survey. They are very nice, very quick, and the food is pretty darn awesome. I know there are a lot of people that knock Boston Market, shame on you haha. This is a really good location though if you're looking for actual food you can get on the go instead of mystery meat what not and fries. Give them a try you won't be disappointed.< /text>< pics>

Boston Market occupies a strange space. Its not quite Fast Food quality, and yet not Quite Sit Down quality. Yet, its food always impresses me. The Squash Casserole, the Mac and cheese with those wonderful spiral pasta noodles, juicy flavorful chicken, and sweet potatoes to die for. Its comfort food without the guild of never calling your mom and then showing up randomly one day to ask for her to cook dinner.</text>

<Rating>1< /Rating><review>The WORST experience of incompetence. I ordered a holiday meal for my family ahead of time. I arrived at the time I was emailed to pick it up at. I went to the line and paid for the order at the cash register and was told by the woman that it would be a 10 minute way for my order to be ready, okay no problem. I don’t know why ten minutes when I arrived at my time but that was fine, I was understanding at that point. I sat there and waited as 15 minutes turned to 20 and so forth thinking maybe they needed extra time, it’s the holidays (although it was not busy at all ). I watched as other spiral ham orders left the store apparently being delivered by staff. I decided to go up to the register and ask how much more time they needed to get the order ready (since I needed to make other stops that day), only to find out that apparently the lady at the register never told the staff to get started on the order so nothing was being done!!! And as they finally started the order they now tell me they don’t know how but they ran out of the spiral ham and it’s sold out, if I’d like something else!!! That even though I ordered my order ahead of time and did my end of the job they didn’t do there’s and somehow sold out on mine! They told me they could give me something different instead and discount it a bit for it but obviously if I wanted something different I would have ordered it. What is the point of ordering something online or “reserving it” if you show up and they sold it to someone else. You honestly cannot count on this store location to do there job apparently. All the manager on duty could say was that she didn’t know what happened. As if it grew legs and walked away. What happened is that not only did the lady at the register not do her job but whoever is in charge of making sure orders are accounted for didn’t do there’s either. Honestly I would NEVER trust this location to handle a catering order again.< /review>< Pics>

Good food. Chicken always tastes good and sides are decent also. Better than kfc in my opinion. Service a little slow but food is worth it. Will be back again.<//Review>

Food was good with tender chicken, only reason its a 4 out of 5 is that one our plates had chicken that was bleeding. Juices weren't running clear but rather still reddish and we weren't comfortable eating that particular piece so we split the other chicken we got and tossed that one. The servers are super nice and eager to help<//Text>

On Christmas day had called to place order but was told No phone orders or internet, once arriving to order was told chicken or turkey was the only you could ordered today. Maybe that should have been mention during the phone call.< /Text>

<Review>Great customer service.  I was greated by two associates as soon as I walked in the door. I needed food for a large crowd, and they took the time to explain the options that netted the must food for my money.  They even helped me carry it to the car!< /Review><UserId.>108309773764033750740<//UserId.>< name>

Its a good idea and it's different than the typical fast food place. However the food was not good. Stuffing was pretty mushy gravy was flavorless. I will say the turkey was pretty juicy but not the best quality. I wasn't really happy with the service either. I honestly asked for my money back which they did so without any issues. But overall not a great place to go.< /Review><Rate>1</Rate>< Gmap_id>

Aside from the associate not knowing his whereabouts (N,S,W & E) or which streets his job is located....my visit was pleasant. The font on the restaurant's menu board should be larger & bolder. Far sighted ppl would struggle, I did esp. that I don't frequent the restaurant.</review>

<review>Did the drive-thru this time hoping for a quick trip. I tried to order ribs they said 15 minute wait so I ordered something else instead and a couple pot pies. They checked to make sure they had some they did and then the waiting started. There was one other car in the drive-thru in front us. We waited over 20 minutes behind it, even turned off my car. Finally he got his stuff and i pulled up to the window. The normal girl at the window register was standing right there and never acknowledge me, now 5 more minutes go by. And a guy from the back kitchen came to the window and told me they don't have any pot pies and i would have to wait 15+ minutes for them. He also told me the rest of my order was bagged and ready(does anyone want their food sitting for over 25 minutes boxed up? ) I told him we have been waiting a long time already and they checked when we ordered, he proceeded with attitude and sarcasm telling me that he didn't know and we have to wait. So I told him cancel my order and I drove to KFC. Kentucky Fried Chicken had what I wanted and didn't make me wait 25+ minutes just to tell me to wait 15 more minutes and no attitude from them. I would and will avoid this location all together. I may give the bullard location another chance. But STAY AWAY FROM this one.< /review><Name>Micah Romero< /Name></record></dataset><record>

<text>I came here today at 2:01pm and this place was out of Turkey and chicken I was in the drive threw and they told me it was a 45 minute wait like I can wait that long in a drive in line the employers two of them got on the box and told me that all they have in a very rude way they open at 11am and its 2pm how did you run out of food ? They had no answer for me this place and the person who in charge of ordering the food sucks no wonder why there is only two of them in fresno I hope the management reads this< /text>< pics>

Been going for awhile and always a "hello" when you walk in. Last few times though they didn't even look at me and we went through drive thru and they totally messed up our order wrong sides and everything. Staff changed maybe but not for the better.< /Review>

Really easy washout. If no ones in the office then pull your company folder off the wall [Prime Inc for example] and call the number on the directions to get a PO number for yourself, write it in the log book. 20 for cold water 25 for hot water [prices for now]<//review>

I've been going here for almost 5 years now. Very friendly and professional employees and family owned. By far one of the best washouts in the area. They're also cheap $24 for hot wash and very quick. I'm always in and out in 10min<//Text>

I have been buying pallets from Dale's for over a year.  They are quick to load the different carriers I send in and always have what I need.  I do not know what i would do without these guys.  All of my Los Angeles customers require pallet exchange.  Norm is always helpful and  so is his staff.  Can't beat their prices or service.<//review>

DO NOT turn into the "entrance" under the sign with the arrow! That is actually the exit. Turn in at the sign with the green truck. And they only wash out trailers.  And there's only a few (1-4) parking spots. They lock the gate when they close for the night.  Otherwise it's $22 and they do a decent job. You can get a fax here also.< /Review>

<review>👍😀👍I am extremely satisfied with the entire service with Sears Appliance Services!👍😀👍
I started with an online service request and was able to see the dates and times that was available to select from. It also shows what the flat rate service call costs. You select the type of appliance is and a drop down for what type of service you need as well as if it's a repair, what the issue appears to be. It's a convenient and easy to use process!
Once you book the appointment, you are kept up with emails and/or text messages regarding the appointment.
If you want emails, you will also receive one that includes the name and a picture of your assigned Service Technician before your service date.
You also have the option to change the date and time if needed. (Which I did due to a necessary medical appointment.)
The Technician called me a couple of hours prior to arrival to advise me he was on schedule as well.
My Technician was wearing a face mask, Very Professional, Courteous, and asked me to review in detail what I had been experiencing with my appliance. Once he determined what needed to be replaced, he advised me of the Total Cost that was all Inclusive.
I authorized the repair and he had the part available in his vehicle.
All said and done within an hour.

Sears actually contracts services to authorized small appliance business. Mine was Cristo Appliances. He was Early on Time Window, explained the issue, had the parts and did a thorough Quality Check afterwards. So far, no issues with part replaced. Good job!< /Review>

I would NOT recommend this appliance service center to anyone.  They confirm your appointment the day before, then just dont show up.  NO tex, or phone call to explain why.  It has happened 3 times.  You take off work to be there and they just don't show up.<//review>

<date>1594654693189< /date><Rate>1</Rate><review>we purchased a Elite Kenmore refrigerator from the Sears store 4 years ago and 5 years warranty agreement..  last week it stopped cooling.. call out Sears to fix the problem.the technician came and checked. Finally he talked with my husband that the refrigerator’s broke 2 items one is cover by warranty and other was about $1000 to replace it. Maybe he know how much you get the refrigerator and he know how much if you get a new one.Why I said that ? Because when I said too expensive for repairing how come a refrigerator still in warranty but I have to pay $500 to get a computer and $500 for the installation fee!!!! Warranty equals NOTHING! This is a $3500 refrigerator we got from Sears! IT COST YOU THOUSAND OF DOLLARS TO FIX A REFRIGERATOR WHICH STILL IN WARRANTY. ARE YOU KIDDING ME? finally he find out we are not gonna take his suggestions he said he want to purchase our refrigerator but he won’t give offer just see how much we want to sell it out. Can you imagine this? Finally he said he can give a discount about $700 to fix it totally but we have to get a Sears home service plan $30 every months not a month! Do you understand? It means you have to pay $1000 for fixing it whatever. So disappointed with Sears! We had get a new refrigerator from Costco already and I will call other Company’s technician to check how much for fix it again. I WILL NEVER EVER SPEND ONE MORE DALLOR ON SEARS ANYMORE!</review>< pictures>

Purchased Kenmore Elite from Sears three years ago and now it stopped working 7/5. Called Sears and they said I would have to pay for parts that were not covered on warranty and labor. This on top of monthly warranty fees. A month and $700 later, I still have not had my refrigerator fixed. Had four appointments and when they did show up, they installed new parts and ran out the door even though we told tech compressor was not making any noise. Now 4th appointment tech says the parts we received were no good. Wants to order other parts and come back in another week. That’s it! No more. Sears is not what it used to be. They are sending A&E repair which are the worst. I’m done with Sears! and do not purchase Kenmore Elite anything because they are made by LG, who has a class action suit against them for knowingly selling refrigerators with faulty compressors.< /Text>

The technician did not fix the water heater. He replaced the burner, but it was not the problem.  The MAIN COMPLAINT IS HE DID NOT TIGHTEN THE TUBE/LINK TO THE GAS AND WE HAD A GAS LEAK.  I HAD TO CALL THE GAS COMPANY AND THEY SHUT THE GAS OFF.  Another technician came out on 6/15 and fixed the problem, which was a sensor.</Text>

My tech Frank M was on time, courteous and thorough.   He serviced what was covered under my maintenance agreement and apprised me of cost and repairs that were needed not covered.  I appreciate Sears service, have for years.  Thank you.< /Review>

Service was great.  However, I am still very unhappy that before work would begin I had to agree to pay for damages to my property if caused by your technician.   This still makes no sense to me whatsoever that you want me to pay for damages caused by you.  Major head-scratcher from the realm of insanity.</Text>

My experience began in November and  ended in May!  My microwave carousel stopped working.   After about 5 house calls by Sears it was not fixed and,in fact, my microwave stopped working altogether. There were 3 or 4 more house calls before our local store manager got involved and only then because my son went to the store to complain. That manager promised me that he would either see it fixed or replaced.  After 2 or 3 more visits they replaced the whole inside of my microwave.  It finally works.  The only good things I can say about this experience is that the store manager was a very nice guy and made sure he followed through.  He also loaned me a microwave to use while mine was not functional.  The guys who finally fixed it were very nice guys.  Sears should be ashamed of itself for letting this go on so long.!!!<//Review>

The service was great! It was thorough and include assistance over and beyond what problem had been reported. I really appreciated the visit and Sears choice of the service person sent to investigate my issues.

Sears said all they can do is refund us back $62.... Dont buy ANYTHING FROM SEARS OR THEIR OUTLET STORES UNLESS YOU DONT MIND BEINGING SCREWED OUT OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS.... Sears is going bankrupt maybe because how they treat their costumers ...maybe their costumers wont return back to buy anything else like we wont either... Now we are in the process of finding a Attorney to sue..also when we asked about the food lost Sears said that the tech was suppose to verify the food lost but since he could not or WOULD NOT verify the model number all the food could not be covered... SEARS was effortless with their help< /Text>< user_id>

I have been having the same problem with my Kenmore range since I bought it. When Pete came up he figured out the source of the problem and took care of it. I no longer have to worry about when my oven will go out again. Thank you Pete.<//Text>

<Pictures>None</Pictures><rate>4<//rate><Text>I was very satisfied with our Sears technician. His knowledge and attention to our needs was beyond 5 stars, thank you so much! All is well with our LG refrigerator and we can now get back to being normal people with food in our house.

The reason I gave the service 4 stars is because of issues beyond our techs control, so it doesn't reflect on him whatsoever. The person I initially spoke to when the fridge croaked (to schedule a repair) was a little on the goofy side. He seemed bored and wanted to talk about anything BUT scheduling a tech to come out. Not a big deal, but when he scolded me because I was surprised that someone couldn't come out sooner, I was not so amused anymore. He said I should be happy with the time frame I got, because some people have to wait for weeks before getting an appointment. WEEKS? Seriously? Just to find out what's wrong?  That seems a bit harsh. I'm not sure if he was serious or just messing with me.

Our tech was very thorough to make sure he pinpointed what was wrong. I'm very happy he did, it's hard to find people who take the time to do a job right anymore. He explained everything he was doing, so it was nice to be informed and understand exactly why the fridge broke down. But, me being the nosey person I am, stuck around when he called his boss and overheard him getting in trouble for taking too long. I was livid! TOO LONG? Of course I bugged him until he admitted that he been scolded because on a past job he had not being more thorough. Really Sears? My husband didn't want me to mention this because he was concerned that our tech might get in more trouble. If that's the case, then maybe Sears is not the company we care to deal with. I'm surprised they can keep their employees if that's how Sears treats them.

Our tech was amazing, I would give him 5+ stars. Sears? Getting 4 stars is being generous.<//Text>< userid>

If I could give negative stars I would!!!!!
Last June I had my fridge and freezer stop cooling to the proper temperature. We had a service repair man who had no idea what he was doing. I'd ask him questions and he'd just say, "I don't know I just fix the problems." He quoted me close to $1000 in repairs.. which is crazy!!
I called to have another service guy come out to give a second opinion. Sears sent the SAME GUY! I had filed a complaint about the guy and they sent him back to my house.
6 weeks later and 4 service guys I FINALLY got my fridge repaired. I called corporate to file complaints I called Sears to file complaints.. no body could care less about the trouble I was put through. Now here I am in November.. just before the holidays and I'm having the same problem with my fridge. And you know what they told me? Your 90 day part guarantee is up, so this will be a new charge. My fridge is less than 2 years old. I'm never buying from Sears again!!</text>

I'm so upset and not to mention the same problem happened the next day after he was here. Guess I'll live out of an ice chest,  I'm so upset.</Review>< Pictures>

I did have a problem with my washer before I went on vacation and I made an appointment for when I will return from my vacation.  The technician came when I came back home and repair the washer but the washer did not drain when I put a wash load that same day.  I called right away customer service and the representative told me that there was not an immediate appointment.  As you can imagine I was full of dirty clothes so  it was an emergency for me to wash my clothes.  The customer representative went the extra mile to get me a closer appointment because she was very understanding of the problem I was experiencing.  I am very happy with the customer service I received and so happy that my washer is fix.<//Review>

I am VERY disappointed with the service I have received.  First the technician that diagnosed the problem and ordered the replacement parts ordered the wrong parts.  This was not know by myself until the repair technician came to repair the broken refrigerator.  He put on the replacement parts and ran another diagnostics on the refriderator and found out that the original part was still good and the control unit was bad. I was expecting the part to be delivered two days ago, but am still awaiting parts and still have no Refrigerator.  I am also wanting to know what will happen to the parts the technician left here from the first repair?

The Sears track record is not going good for myself right now.<//Text>

Our appointment was rescheduled without our knowledge then we found that it was in the message received prior to the original set time and day.  When the tech came it was very hard to talk to him since he did not speak English very well and his comprehension was a bit limited.  Additionally, we had difficulty understanding.  My wife made an appointment initially for a service maintenance check along with a repair to the door switch on the washer.  This was not coded properly so the tech was not prepared for any repairs and he could not do any service check on the washer.  He said he would scheduled a repair service for the following week.  He spoke to a women on the phone who attempted to instruct him that he had to close out the current visit with the proper code before he can schedule a new visit for the repair.  He obviously did not understand what she was attempting to explain to him so he just hung up.  He said he would schedule another appointment for the repair.  When I received the email re: the rescheduled repair it was for a service maintenance check and was set for July 16th, not June 6 as he said he would.  I am very concerned that our rescheduled repair that has been schedule by us will end up in another botched attempted  since the email we got for this repair still only says service maintenance check without any indication for a repair need.  Visiting techs need be well versed in English, both speaking and comprehension in addition to whatever their birth language is.  This was a very frustrating visit.  On a plus side the tech was polite but he was getting as frustrated as we were due to the language barrier.<//text>

Sears out sourced to Arrow Appliance.  The representative was on time and courteous.  He tried several things to fix the balance and finally found the problem.  So glad they didn’t have to order a part.<//Text>

The service representative was scheduled to come between 8am - 12pm.  I took a day off of work to be available.  The service rep showed up ant 12:50pm, almost an hour late.  Furthermore, he continued to ask me questions about the error code I received on my dishwasher and what it meant.  I had happen to read my manual, so I was aware the error code was that there was hose and/or blockage issue.  However, I had to show him my manual for him to tell me the same thing my manual stated.  Moreover, I was supposed to be scheduled to have my refrigerator serviced as well. The service rep stated he was only scheduled for the dishwasher.  I specifically scheduled a service call for both the dishwasher and refrigerator. I thought the fact he was almost an hour late and did not call to inform me he was running late the least he could of done is just looked at my refrigerator.  I thought my entire experience lacked  "good customer service" along with the chat line I used to schedule my service.< /Text>

<Rate>3</Rate><review>The tech was nice & was trained on washer/dryer, refrigerators, stoves & dishwashers, so I only had to deal with 1 tech.  I had maintenance service on all 5 appliances, only two of which actually needed service.  The oven door needed new hinges, they were ordered & arrived in 2 days.  Now I have to wait another week for the tech to install them.  The washer is another story!  During the second load I ran the same problem reoccurred.  Now I have to wait almost 2 more weeks for a tech to come back out!  At this point I'm not unhappy with the tech, he thought he'd fixed the problem.  BUT,  I am unhappy about how long I have to wait for another service call without my washer!</review>< pictures>

The Sears Employee came at the last hour 1700hrs, he acted like he was so tired (dragging) in my home. He failed to even check behind the appliances to see if there were any items that may have needed attention. I only buy Sears products and have never received any bad service from their repairmen until now! If he needed any assistance my husband and I were home and would have gladly assisted him in whatever he needed. Instead of him asking for assistance, "he stated on the receipt the space was too tight , appliances too heavy to move."  "WTH" you're a Sears repairmen you should have all the tools to assist you in every situation. I guess good quality help is going out the window with everything else...</review>

Took two extra weeks to complete a washing machine service that only took ten minutes.  Unacceptable and a sanitation issue for my home-business. This driver was not able to find my home, and I had to go get him.  He turned off the gas to my dryer, so I found a load of wet clothes after the cycle.  The washer works fine now, but the delay for a paid service was unprofessional, and I will not buy from Sears again unless their service department is upgraded in the future.< /Text>

Your service SUCKS! I had a 5 year warranty on a "kenmore washer and dryer" from you. It was a gift from my husband. Your warranty is a joke. When I finally got a replacement after getting a damaged unit your store screwed me! I could not get the replacement model on line but I was railroaded into a cheaper crappier model that I did not want when I first got my set. So I bought a 21 hundred dollar unit to get a replacement that ended up being under 11 hundred dollar unit that has gone to destroying my close.

I have had years of not one tech coming to my door. And the ones that have come out here never listed the problems. This last tech was such a moron he WATCHED MY UNIT HAVE POWER BUTTON ISSUES!!!! Not bothering to put this on the report. He just notes that my unit is fine and I am using something other than Tide detergent.

The Sears Store in Palmdale CA is complete crap!!!! DON'T BUY FROM THEM!!! I PAID FOR SERVICE for my Kenmore vacuum and got it back beat up and not even cleaned!

Never again will I give you business. Your warranty is a joke, my money was wasted and I have no lost several grand in clothing from a crappy unit that was never protected nor could your techs even do their job!!!!<//review>

I with there were negative marks to highlight instead of stars - they don't deserve any stars.  I have had an exhausting interaction with repair men.  I have a free standing ice maker and the repair company kept putting a ticket in for a refrigerator ice maker. The first tech didn't know what to do - his response was it was dirty and to just clean it.
Second tech finds my ice maker is under warranty and I need to call GE.
I call GE get the run around but finally an authorization to have it covered under warranty.
Third tech says I have to cancel the call because the ticket was set up incorrectly - refrigerator instead of stand alone ice maker.
In the midst of calling GE again - I now am waiting to talk to fourth tech.
I am going crazy< /Review>

Setting up the appointment was easy and the service repair gentlemen showed up as scheduled. However, he replaced the part he said was broken but the dishwasher still was not cleaning the dishes and still making the same noise. Two days later my husband came home to a flooded kitchen and garage. He called Sears and they said the first available appointment was 5 days. There was no help for five days and we had to turn off all the water to the house. My husband ended us calling another appliance repair company and they came out immediately and turn off the water to the dishwasher!!!!
Then told my husband the dishwasher would cost over 500.00 to fix. Now I have water damage and had to file a claim with homeowners insurance and buy a new dishwasher!!!!!
Sears repair did state they would refund the cost to repair the dishwasher but not the
$ 59.99 fee for coming out.<//Text>

REPAIR PERSON ARRIVED ON TIME.  CLEANED UNDER THE FREEZER AND SAID THAT THEIR WAS NOTHING WRONG WITH THE APPLIANCE.  CHARGED ME $100.00 AND LEFT.  THE REFRIGERATOR STILL MAKES THE LOUD NOISE SO NOW I WILL HAVE TO HIRE SOMEONE ELSE TO COME AND FIND OUT WHAT IS WRONG WITH IT AND FIX IT.  VERY DISAPPOINTING, TO SAY THE LEAST.</Text>

our washer broke april 30, the repairs were not complete until the 18th. The first repair man who looked at it saw water in the tub and automaticly said it was the pump the next week they replaced the pump just to find out that was not the problem. Took us another week to get the parts. The service dept was helpful gave us a 50 dollar gift card to help with the cost of doing laundry at the laundry mat. I still feel it took to long to repair a washer that was only 1 1/2 years old.<//Review>

Improper diagnostic, repairman claimed it was the door latch switch on dryer when in fact it was a faulty wall plug outlet.  Repairman failed to return on date promised and finally when he did arrive and installed new latch switch he had to use a different wall outlet to make it work which tells me that the wall outlet was the problem in the first place.  Repairman refused to give me the phone number of his supervisor.  Dealing with the sears phone personnel is frustrating and at times impossible, I spent over 2 hrs on the phone and was disconnected three times and was never able to talk to a supervisor. .  I find that there is no accountability in the Sears appliance repair program.<//Text>

<Text>It was more "Tooters" than "Hooters" if you know what I mean. Anyways, food was real good, curly fries were okay, onion ring tower was delicious, but I cannot for the life of me remember what the name of the two weird sauces were named. Would come back though on a Wednesday for their unlimited wing special!</Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOdS8dT7cMviJPfZGV6wIh0RAKlh6Dj2ZScletk=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< response>

<Rate>1</Rate><Pics>None</Pics><text>THEY HAVE ROACHES. NASTY!!!!!!!    I was sitting at one of their booths and there is a server station right next to where I was sitting and on the back wall I saw something dark and small moving.... looked a little closer and it was roaches. I will never eat here again. They didn't have half of the stuff that was on their menu and the managers are a joke. Food is super greasy when it came out. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME! If you do chose to waste your time here, don't sit next to the kitchen; cooks were cussing up a storm and yelling F bombs. Also the girls are not good for anything besides looking pretty.< /text>< Name>

<text>Not too long ago, I had noticed that the quality of the service and food at Hooters had declined immensely.  We stopped going there for awhile.  We came in today and the service was great!  The wings were fresh and piping hot.  Amanda was our server was very friendly and professional.  I hope this is the turning of a new leaf for Hooters!!<//text><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None<//resp><GmapID>0x8094681c4a3fb653:0x938f99593a917728<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Been awhile since I have been here. Better than I remember. My wings got misplaced. Things happen. The response was awesome. Explained everything, sympathetic, even threw in some extra wings. Mistakes happen, it's how you recover that makes the difference. No complaints from me. Great time with the wife.< /text>

Ordered steak fries instead of regular fries. Still came out with regular fries. Server said it was her fault. Then waited 15 minutes foe the correct fries. I had to ask 2 separate times about them. Then when they were brought out the server didn't say a word. Didn't apologize for it taking so long nothing.</Review>

It was terrible food. Waitresses were nice though. Kids meal sliders were not cooked all the way. One of our drinks had a cherry pit which broke a tooth.  Luckily the manager gave us our meals on the house.</Review>

1/30/19 A Wednesday. Service sucked! We hadn't been there in months and tonight service sucked. Our server was unattentive, we got our wings cold. Wasted too much time, we didn't even get a 2nd round of wings. It was not busy at all tonight.</Text>

Service at the Fresno Location has really suffered lately. The food has never impressed me especially for the money they charge. Much better happy hour rates at other nearby restaurants.< /Review>

The flavors are ok but the wings are fairly small when compared to BWW. It's also kinda hit or miss on getting warm food as our table had 1/4 of the dishes come out cold.< /Text>

First, no one smiled the entire time I was there. The employee that seated us thought my wife an I were part of another party waiting near the front door so she ignored us intil my wife got her attention. She gave both my wife an I the feeling that she hated her life because she had to deal with customers. Once seated, I asked if I could have one of the T.V.'s changed to the UFC event on Fox. She told us that her manager wasntw showing the fights. I replied that the fights werntwe PPV and that they were on network T.V.. She then said "I don't ask questions". I asked to speak to the manager so I could personally ask what the prejudice was towards the fights. After she walked away, both her and the manager passed our table several times and ignored our table. We got up and instantly drove down the parking lot to Famous Dave's where not only did we get immediately seated and THEY WERE SHOWING THE FIGHTS!<//Text>

Pricey but the girls are always friendly and there wings are better than buffalo wild wings but at the same level as wing stop. Depending on which I'm at in the area I will either stop at hooters or willing stop.< /text>

I am thoroughly disgusted with the way I was treated this evening.

My gf loves chik-fil-a. We had Hooters a couple of days ago so she didn't want Hooters again tonight. So we got her a chik-fil-a. sandwich first and hit Hooters to cover my buffalo shrimp craving.

The waitress took my order but while i ran to wash up, I come back and hear, we can't eat food not ordered from this restaurant AND we need to leave.

Highly insulted.  Been to Hooters all over the country and in other countries.  SO MANY WAYS this could have been better handled.  If I hadn't already ordered and was hungry, I would have walked out immediately.

Then to add insult to injury, I asked for some ranch dressing for my $22 buffalo shrimp order.  I was told, that will be 79 cents.  NOW I'M PISSED.  I'm sure the waitress could tell and she brought it without charging me... but it's the principal of the thing.

Will be reaching out to corporate in this one.</Review>

<Review>The food was not as good as other hooters I've been to. The waitress was terrible. Very unattentive. Only came twice the whole meal to check on us, once being literally 30 seconds after getting our food and asking is how it was before we even had a chance to try it. The second time being to bring me a refill of soda 10 minutes after we finished eating and we're waiting for the check.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

<Text>This place has insanely racist hiring practices.  Please call them and tell them you do not accept this...if you need proof- feel free to contact me. On top of it...the girls are rude. no wonder why they have less than two cents of a yelp review- they insist in hiriring fair rude maidens while rejecting and qualified "color" that enters the store.

Like i said...if you need proof - contact me. Boycott this awful place. Take your money and your business else where.</Text>< date>

<review>Me and my family my two boys always go there every week or every other week always good vibes the guy manager is awesome all the waitresses are so friendly specially Taylor the food  but just this weekend the African American manager who was not that long ago a waitress told our waitress who is so friendly and nice as well we couldn't get the coupon because we walked in together and seat on seprete tables Evan if we payed separate so we were waiting about 20 minutes cause we wantted to talk to her the "girl manager". All we had order was 4 fountain drinks we didn't Evan drink and I had to go up to her and ask her if we can jus seat on seprete tables so we can use it and she was so rude I Evan told her if we can walk out and walk back in and seat on seprete tables just back to back ! And she was so rude said no? ! I would rate 5 star because we love it there But such and imbersment for my friends and fam because talked to good about this place ! And it wasn't the $ because we ended up paying about $100 at Red Robin we just didn't think it was fair ! I would never go back there again just for her .</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

<review>I was expecting great food 1st time it wasnt  good. Infact it was pretty bad cold and didnt look appetizing at all. Secod time it was pretty ok. What saves them is the servers. Hey Hooters dont be jerks even if people get all you can eat wings they should get to take what they could not eat home.  You should never say no to a customer especially over something so simple to make somebody happy. Theres your tip 😉<//review><resp>None< /resp><UserId.>116929079998743404614< /UserId.><Time>1480868629688</Time>< user_name>

Waitress had an attitude problem and gave us very poor service. The wings were cold and weren't even all that good. I had to ask her several times for condiments and refills. I'm never going back!< /Text>

<Text>Food really isn't that good the only thing worth seeing is the games and the girls cause well tight shirts and short skirts and if you have kids yeah you can get a balloon for them but really go somewhere else try anything else cause if you want a meal you'll be disappointed if you want the sights well you're in for a treat.<//Text>< Pics>

<review>(Translated by Google) I am 45 years old and they asked me for my passport and because I did not bring it they did not want to sell me beer, I showed my ife and they told me that that Mexican identification was worth nothing. And I left the place.

Loved the bagels here. Had the spicy eggel on an everything bagel and it was amazingly good.  Quirky decor inside which was great.<//Text>

First time in and enjoying it. Needed to kill some time before an appointment down the road. If you are looking for craft lattes, high-end baked goods, or table service this isn’t your spot. BUT it is perfect for a simple cup of black coffee, croissant or bagel.  Not overly expensive like other places in the area, and still delicious. Croissant was surprisingly light, fluffy and crisp. Service was fast and friendly. I’d come back.</Review>

A wide variety of coffee and tea. Maybe my experience was a one off that wasn't good. Ordered a spiced chai latte, all it tasted like was licorice and water. The coffee we ordered too had a flat taste. Had I tried it when I was there I would've asked for something else but I had already driven down the road. I saw a Peetes coffee and tea down the road. Pulled over, poured out my coffee and chai. Went to Peetes. I don't think I'll be going back here unless someone else is taking me. It certainly wouldn't be my first choice.<//Review>

<Rating>1<//Rating><text>Came in and got a small white mocha and a lady lox, 16.00 USD. Ok, it's California I expect things to be pricy. 15 percent tip on cards is the lowest so 2 bucks on top of that (we all know the routine).
Sandwich came first. Not bad, nothing to complain about, nothing great. Coffee was a few minutes later... tasted like burnt hair. Seriously the worst experience i have ever had with coffee and the second time it has happened at this location.
If your gonna charge an arm and a leg for a cup of coffee, at least hire a barista that knows how to make a drink...
Took me all of 3.50 to get a non gross coffee at the JC library when I left here...< /text>< Pics>

<text>Terrible. My bagel was made as if someone slapped all the ingredients together with no thought. It wasn't even cut in two, it was cut by a person who vaguely knows how to use a knife. The whole thing was falling apart and they added pepperoncinis when I specifically did not ask for it. Staff needs better training.< /text><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

It was great but a lot of times they don't have enough electric carts for handicapped people. A lot of times I've been there and I've had to wait probably about 30 minutes for a car or for somebody to finished shopping with one. Also my mom is 81 years old and she's been there before and they don't help her or make sure she gets all of her bags we were just there the other day and she bought a big bag of chicken nuggets she paid for them but they did not make sure and put it in her cart or make sure she got everything on the bag area<//text>

<Review>This trip I wanted to return an item to Customer Service (that I had bought on line), and was very impressed with how easy the transaction was. The staff was friendly and there was no line.
Each time I visit I notice new services like curbside pick-up and in-store pick-up stations.< /Review><gmap_id>0x80db1c9258a1abdf:0xe9dda3cf6db5da70<//gmap_id>< rating>

Don't like the store layout. Not easy to find things. Won't be going inside again but will probably still do curbside pickup.< /text>

<Name>Dave Gordon</Name><Date>1583393806735</Date><Rating>5< /Rating><Review>It's a fine Walmart and they had some great sales on Spam for about $3.30 per can and Vienna Sausage for only $0.50 per can. The store also seems to have some good security in the parking lot, which was nice to see. Store people were courteous and they scan every receipt to verify it has the correct products.  Store was clean and tidy. The only odd thing was that the overhead lights flickered on and off several times, that made me think the store was closing,  but it wasn't.</Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMoC1CpbcdFFpo-pyy8opONhXmoaWM_OXQSwOq0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMEiLh6nP9SZs_M91JIP_eo0s7Qm2rbVmZrzw6q=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMcnT7_xIdDM9H3I6Uu9pPDt8_mzz3d3knt0St0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP0PvXYqZM-VWlpk1-Gtwescjdj-VqplpPyEsa8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMPHjPv6f1cFfq0_poaCarR3G4VjApZOpXdR0VC=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO1JHfJiLQfsdrWJcV0Dy0tQ60hu1H4C0unbDNH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPtI6oBmftIRtTUAAUW0TqumPOyQoPnMZdw5ldo=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN28sXQjw8s6Ru2U7LlXjfPOcRLyHm4wS7fbYZp=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNJuxQfB9f_afTBsaxafyEN16AM9BHgOewLREAz=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP97wNQ1FDcCPr8PZoS4_04UR3AzG8agOx2fs-R=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOMAAKqpQ3ngUQ-p4Bsm19gLCzQc5i_e4Sz6vKl=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmap_id>

Well it's frustrating when you order a curbside order selecting the option to "pay" for the privilege of getting your goods in plastic bags only after they load them in the trunk they tell you "oh sorry we're out of bags" ...oh great I'll just take the cans in 4 at a time....So I was going to call and check first if they have bags BUT no one answers {35+ rings}  so I guess no order for me< /text>

There's never any body working to help you when you need something they're always so scarce for unknowledgeable that it is just an inconvenience to even go to the store, the pharmacy people are super rude. I give it a two-star because basically one star is just surviving too is every once in a while someone does stand out and help...<//Review>

People who i have come across at Walmart these days tend to have the "It's not my job attitude "  When a person walks through life with this kind of attitude,  it shines brighter then you think. I most times end up helping myself rather than ask an associate for help. I pray that I am the only one who has grown accustomed to this environment...🙏😒<//review>

<Review>Remember, once you purchase something both it and the receipt you are given are legally your personal property, so the next time someone asks to see your receipt, you have a choice whether you would like to show them or not. If you don't want to be bothered, held up, delayed or otherwise inconvenienced in any way, it is perfectly lawful acceptable to decline, regardless of the nature of the purchase (with or without bags, luxury items, 18+ items, etc.) You have a right to not be harrased, accosted or intimidated - even questioned and certainly to not be stopped or detained for doing nothing wrong. Be polite, be frank, but be aware of your right as a citizen to say "No thank you" as you calmly and confidently move along through the exit.

<review>I've always liked to shop at Walmart.  They have decent quality and the best prices around.  I've been a regular shopper there for about ten years or so.  But their new policy of only 1 or 2 checkers, forcing most customers to submit to the Self Checkout line, has me saying no thanks!  I'll shop somewhere else from now on.

I don’t enjoy coming to Walmart Palm Springs. Almost every associate I encounter has a horrible attitude or just ignores you. I came today because I needed to pick up online orders but one item was unavailable. Manager Austin was great, he was so helpful and attentive the entire time. Made me rethink me coming back to this Walmart because he completely changed my view of this location. This Walmart should hire people lead by his example. Thank you!< /Review>

Dreadful.  Do they have anyone working other than cashiers?  Couldn't find help anywhere, even after asking.  Consistent terrible experiences.</review>

A couple of things that could have made my visit a little more enjoyable. The first thing was having what originally came for. I google Earl Steven Selection or Wines and was to Walmart was the closest store with it. I am not sure if that's Walmart or Google issue.
After doing about 15 mins of shopping I had to wait inline for another 20mins. With a store of this magnitude especially in peak time there should be more actual check out lines available to help with the rush. The self check lines were meant for convenience. For those people with just a few items to get in and out faster. Instead the are shutting down all lanes to cut back on wages. Most customers especially elders are unfamiliar and slower. This make the experience not so pleasant.
Oh yeah, get some employees who actually perform customer service, smiling, be pleasant , polite, and helpful. That's what they are paid to do.</review>< pictures>

We went here as our go-to-place to buy anything. Today, it was cat food. They were completely out of Little Friskies, but had some other brands. However, cats demand no changes in their diet and are very adamant if you attempt it. So we went to the Walmart on Monterey. They had a few cans but were almost completely out of stock. On top of things, the construction being done there shuffled stuff willy-nilly throughout the store.
However, some day things will be better. 🙄< /Text>

They lock up men's shaving supplies and any medical equipment like fever thermometers. Good luck trying to find an employee with a key. Sunblock is sold in the cosmetics section and you have to pay for it at the cosmetics counter, while leaving your shopping cart outside. Groceries are a joke. On a recent visit they were out of: plastic produce bags, plain Greek yogurt, fresh berries, heavy cream. Every aisle is absolutely stuffed with junk food. The self-scanners don't work for the bar codes on vegetables, even though you are constantly reminded that they do, and you have to go through a tedious lookup process.< /Review>< pictures>

<review>Online order and come to pick up to nobody answering the phone. There's a recorded message to leave your number for a call back that sends you to a full mail box.
Now we're parked in pick-up and waiting in line to get into store to PICK UP OUR ORDER!!
Get your store in order Palm Springs!
My suggestion, use Palm Desert store. Their order pick-up is well staffed unlike Palm Springs</review><Rating>1< /Rating><time>1608148825187< /time><resp>None<//resp><user_name>Eric The Scot (Eric The Scot)</user_name><pictures>None< /pictures>< user_id>

I often see exceptionally discounted/clearance priced merchandise in the Walmart App listed as "in stock" at the Palm Springs Walmart...Will find something good and I motor on over there, all excited, and...
Surprise! The item is no where to be found. .It happens more often than the app is accurate.   I've shopped via the app at other Walmart stores for clearance and they seem to be more on the ball. Other stores can get it together why not Palm Springs store 1832? They have historically blamed shoplifters for most of 1832's issues as.long as its been open. YAWN. I'm gonna stop hangin' out at the Walmart...(lol) but then what else is there? El Paseo? 99c only? Jensen's?</Review>

Jill, my cashier Sunday afternoon was very nice, and she packed up my bags very carefully. I was impressed. Usually my items are just tossed in the bags. Jill was mindful so that my produce wasn't smashed and bags were evenly balanced and steady to sit up in the car. I was thankful and impressed!<//Review>

<Review>I love walmart and this place is walmart.... So it's going to get three stars because it's convenient store to go too. My problem with this walmart is they don't have what Im looking for frequently or they'll get low stock but to be honest my biggest issue with theses THIS STORE PARTICULAR is they literally always always run out of bags and then your big fun walmart purchase becomes a HEADACHE to get home!<//Review>< Gmap_id>

So was the gentlemen restocking the shelves. Had a question about in store products and he went to his phone to find out. Unsuccessful but he tried. What should've been an in and out was an hour in store. Socializing and picking up my few Dr. requiremented products. Our elders are dying for communication and interactions. I generally say, "hello", to everyone I make eye contact with. Today Two elder women. Met one on the way in that was a Raiders fan. Her husband had her geared up. Yeah buddy! I just so happen to be geared up in 2021 draft so, I just had to drop that. A good 5 minute convo. Back to my socializing... The other elder I made eye contact with replied back something I wasn't expecting. It would've been a hi and bye quick conversation if I had not been listening. When I said, "See you later!" She replied, "Maybe not! We just don't know." Pause.. Wait! What did you just say and probably expected me to keep going bout my way? She repeated it. Are you ok? Do you need to talk. 72 year old woman, Covid "long term". Husband in hospital now with it. It's taken a toll on her life expectancy. Her once not so serious medical conditions are extreme now. Her physicians have warned her she will battle until defeat with the medical condition as primary and Covid as the secondary. She has the support of her daughter, but when she returns home it just her, the cat and the Tele. We literally talked for 45-50 minutes. She got some stuff off her chest. When she was ready to depart her spirits had lifted. All in an hour at Walmart. Sometimes day are just like that. Finished shopping and was about the rest of my day.<//Review><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< GmapID>

<text>This location has more of everything! Better selection on food,clothes, electronics and especially school /office and craft products, which are my top 2 favorite categories to shop for or rather splurge on. The clothes selection is much better than any other locations in the valley. I feel they have more to offer in the clearance aisle at this location which I always have to search thru before I leave. Staff are great and always helpful when I needed assistance. Restrooms and changing rooms are always clean, which I appreciate.<//text><rate>4< /rate></record>

Checkout was a nightmare.  In checkout line for 15 to 20 minutes.  Hire more,  move more.  I have left the store leaving my merchandise behind because its too long a wait to get in and get out of the store.  Love your abundance of merchandise but checking out makes me think twice about shopping there</Review>

Went in for 2 things they didnt have either 1 associate was very helpful trying to find gift cards for me no carousel and they kept moving it so no one could find it and he tried did fine 1 short rack in the ckout isle with maby 10 differnt gift cards not the one i needed. The 2nd thing i looked for and had to ask the checkout gal in cosmetics she was busy, i waited, then she was short with me and said there down there pointing North. I never found "down there" so i left. So i guess i should give 3 stars for the helpful man< /review>

Covid: No curbside pick-ups but you can pick-up in store. It's easy and I personally felt safe as they adhere to covid rules.

Quality: even though almost 30% cheaper than other retail outlets, the quality of products are great.

Online Service: online purchases is a little confusing with the various apps but once you know which to use for the product you require, the site is user-friendly.
In-store Service: everyone is helpful under the circumstance.

Conclusion: check online to avoid going inside but if you must go inside, don't worry, it seems to be safe, clean and easy.<//Text>

My review takes into consideration Walmart is a big box store not a architectural marvel. My 5 star rating is based on the combination of services, products, checkout, restrooms, parking, customer service, and access for the handicapped. In all of these categories Palm Springs Wal-Mart fulfills all my expectations.< /Review>

<review>Second time trying pick up since I am physically unable to do shopping myself. First time, the system went down and they said come back the next day. That’s understandable. When we went back the next day, they had returned all the items. This time, my order is so far an hour late and no department will answer a phone. I understand it’s the busy season, but this is the only way for me to get food to my family. No email mentioning a delay. My order hasn’t even been picked yet! It was due at 5 and it’s about to be 7! I’m just so frustrated

Update: had to call corporate just to get an update on my order. After blaming the driver service twice, they finally admitted that this Walmart is behind on orders. They shouldn’t be taking a volume of orders they cannot handle. I had to call twice the next morning to find anything out.<//review><Time>1607703998103< /Time>< name>

It has a grocery side and then the regular Walmart stuff. The prices were good. My only issue is the store was 100% out of bags to bag up customers items. They were just about out if the very large $1.99 tote bags That they also sale. This was terrible seeing how customers had carts full of groceries and other household items. I found this to be unexceptable.<//text>< Time>

Helpful staff. No more buses so I needed a uber but my phone died and had no charger. Staff cared enough to SUGGEST without me asking..that I could plug my phone into the Print kiosk..because it had every type of charger to transfer photos from your phone. Great suggestion. Imagine how relieved I was. And the staff there did not make me feel ackward for using the machine to charge my phone a bit. Thank you. I suggest if ever need something go straight to customer service..that is where managers are always lingering and are on alert. Stocker don't know much and cant help. There's a difference between stackerd and employees so as soon as u walk in inquire at customer Service..they will radio the appropriate staff.< /review>

They have a wide variety of just about everything here. The food section has a lot of items you probably wont find anywhere else. They also have 2 self serve checkout sections to get you out of there fast!</Review>

Rated - 0 for Customer Service from the Store Mgr., Security and Associates. Totally unprepared for addressing medical emergency situations and communication. Absolutely disgraceful.  This store chose to forfeit  over $250.00 in USD (equivalent in pesos) over the purchase of 2 candy bars and a bottle of water (less than $5.00 USD equivalent in pesos). American Store and refusing USD. Go figure...?</review>

<Review>My daughter sent me a text that they had sent a birthday gift to me through Walmart as they live in another state. I was super excited and they gave me a time frame and sent my phone number as the contact number. I pulled in and then realized as I looked at my phone that I had to download the app. As I am in the middle of figuring out how to download it Etc an nice man comes up to my window knocks on the window and says what is your phone number and our name and I can bring your order. So I gave him the important information and an extremely nice different young man came out within 5 minutes with my order. Of course both young men had gloves and masks and we're extremely polite. I was delighted with their good manners and the Quick Service. This particular Walmart was in Palm Springs.<//Review>< user_id>

The service was a bit slow, but I know that it’s because of the quantity of people that go everyday. I noticed that there was too much people entering at once. Maybe they should only allow one member per household enter and create an “age cap” in order to slow down the pandemic. No one under 65 is allowed in the 1ˢᵀ hour of services. No kids older than 3 and younger than under 16 allowed; create a “safe zone” next to the disabled parking in the parking lot where children can safely be left in their running cars that can all be supervised by the security guards. But that’s just me. Other than that, they’re doing a good job service-wise. Note: Customers, please be kind to the assistants. They’re more overwhelmed than most us are.</Review>

<text>I Ordered a day before on Saturday for  the following day Sunday 5-6pm  for online pickup. I received a notification my order was ready I checked in waited and waited . When I  got there lots of peoplewere  waiting  I only saw one Walmart associate carting groceries out. I got out of my car and asked the associate if I can just go in and grab my groceries and  they replied yes. I walk all the way in and go to pick up are just to be told it’s not ready even though I ordered a day before and received and email and text that my order is ready. Ridiculous from waiting to waiting to going inside to find out it’s not even done yet and wasting gas to drive down to store . So I decide to leave and come back next day for order and guess what  I still waiting about two hours for my order get your system fixed not everyone can just get out of car and go shop  FRUSTRATING<//text><user_id>110937130760124477577</user_id></record></dataset><record>

I wanted to buy a set of flatware.  The nice set was marked $56 on the shelf, the highest price of all the sets.  Picked it up and went to check out with my other items.  The set rang at $156.  I asked the attendant to check the shelf price, must be a computer programming error.  After waiting 10 minutes, she returned and said to go to the manager at customer service.  Went to customer service and the girl in charge said, "probably someone put it in the wrong place".  So I pulled up the Walmart website and showed her the identical set at $56.  She inferred that somehow I had made up my own Walmart website? (I am not a computer expert), and proceeded to look it up on her phone instead.  Then she says, well you can have it for $99.  To top it off, the other people behind the counter were wearing masks that covered just their mouth and not their nose.  I said no thank you and I won't be back.</Text>

The absolute worse visit to the Cathedral City Walmart EVER!! At Self Check only 1 employee to handle numerous registers.  If there's problem a red blinking light indicates assistance is needed and employee code is required to continue, this happened multiple times each time waiting several mins before employee would come. When finally done and ready to pay, register indicates no cash can be accepted, cards only!! Again red blinking light turned on, after waiting 5mins w/out help my husband went searching for that employee was told he'd have to wait shed be there as soon as she could. We waited about 20 total mins only to be told "sorry card only register" she then just turned and walked away. We did not have a card to use. So after shopping in the store for about 45mins left basket of food items there at the register. There was no  notice anywhere indicating "no cash accepted"!! Poor floor coverage many employees that appeared to be aimlessly walking around. Customers behind us had to go to other registers.<//text>

I bought a cake for my sons birthday including the cupcakes and smash cake but when we got home we realized they didn’t give us the smash cake. I been calling the bakery and customer service line since last night and still no one answers. This Walmart is highly understaffed. Lines are long and people don’t respect social distancing. I’m going to avoid coming here unless I absolutely have to go there.< /Text>

Well let's just say that I never show the receipt to the person at the door..
Except today when I showed him the discrepancy that the 5 limes I just bought. I was charged $.32 each lime. Then I asked him to turn around and look at the sign where they are selling limes and it says $.88 per pound.  I then said so who is ripping who off here.<//review>

Recently, I go to this well-known supermarket nearby, it's just walking distance from our house. And I was glad by their security and pleasant attendants.  They welcome their customers so much and had all the products and items we need. I will always visit this supermarket for my groceries next time.</text>

< Review>
The store is busy.  The workers were putting out product both times we went blocking whole parts of the aisles with carts full of product or pallets in larger areas.  Found what we were looking for with little to no fuss.  Service was awful to non existent.  We were greeted and thanked which raised it to a 3/5.</Review>

Love it!! Wal-Mart's New scan & go is a game changer... and this location makes it super easy. Scan your item, bag as you add to your cart and scan final at speed check-out. AWESOME! kudos to Doug McMillion for making the future happen now!!</Review>

<review>This Walmart didn't have the vitamins I was looking for. The shelves were in a dissaray in the vitamin section. They also charge ten cents per bag and they do not tell you they charge for bags. I am from out of town and they would not accept my government issued EBT card for my groceries. Worst Walmart I have ever been to. Tried calling the store to speak with a manager no one answers.</review>< pics>

All 3 locations, Palm Desert, Palm Springs and La Quinta are the worst in customer service. I’ve called multiple times trying to get a hold of someone and nobody ever answers the phone. 40+ minutes trying to get a hold of someone. And you wonder why Amazon is kicking their tail.</review>

This store has friendly service and is very well stocked.

They have a good selection and their fruit and vegetables are fresh and the department is kept clean and neat.

They have well stocked meat cases and always keep them clean and organized.</review>

I dropped my phone in the parking lot and didn't realise it.   A person retrieving carts found it, turned it into customer service, and let the security staff know what happened.  When I realised it was gone I went straight to the parking lot and there were 2 security guards nearby.   The line was kinda long because of pandemic precautions, so a guard escorted me directly to customer service to get my phone skipping the line!!!

I want to once again express my gratitude to the employee who made it possible for me to get my phone back and the security staff for taking it seriously and following through with the issue.  Let me be the, well nowhere close to, the first person to say thats a rarity to find these days, especially in an are well known for the less than honest crowd in the area looking for opportunities!  Thank you all  very much!</text>

< review>
Overall the store is typical for a Walmart Supercenter.  However, I require a ride around cart as I am disabled and this store perpetually  does not have sufficient ones. Last year there was only one ride around cart for the entire store and it was being used, so I was forced to push a regular cart, one week after shoulder surgery! (I was told at that time that they were all broken and were out for repair.) However I was at the store several months later and again I had to wait if I wanted to use one. Since I only needed a few items I used a regular cart and left, disgusted. Two  weeks ago I was feeling very bad, so I made my request known and waited, and waited, and waited. There was no way I could use a regular cart so I either had yo wait or leave without shopping.  The employees at the front of the store were aware of my need for the ride around cart, and yet they later locked the doors and left, with me sitting and waiting, without saying a word. Realizing that no one would be leaving through the locked doors (they had earlier told me to watch for a cart to become available) so I was forced to walk across the store to wait at the other doors, again telling the employees that I was waiting for a ride around cart. There was no bench at these doors so I was forced to stand and wait even longer.  I had waited OVER AN HOUR and was just ready to give up and leave when I saw an employee bringing a ride around cart!  I don't blame the employees, including the manager who was working when I was there, but whoever is in charge of this store does not consider the needs of disabled people seriously enough. They need MORE ride around carts at this store! I regularly shop at a different  Walmart Supercenter and a Neighborhood Walmart and have NEVER had to wait more than a couple of minutes for a ride around cart. But at Palm Springs Walmart, disabled people beware.< /review>

Single WORST Walmart in the country.  Employees are  SLOW as snails and RUDE, management is NONEXISTANT.  Just try calling them, the phone will ring until it just disconnects.  Took over three hours to get my curbside pick up brought out to my car, not the first time this has happened but it will certainly be the last.    Just try complaining...I was told just this morning by their employee Manny working curbside pick up that I was the one with the attitude because I asked him if it was acceptable to him that one of their customers has waited 3 hours for a simply curbside pick up order that they texted me was ready for pick up before I even left the house.  Sure Manny, I am the one with the attitude.</review>

A multi billion$ company should have been way ahead of this pandemic. Many of the shelves are bare. No point making the long trip to Walmart if they don't have the items you're shopping for! The one that bothers me the most is no bags at the check out. Loading single items in my trunk is beyond frustrating!</text>

<review>They never have enough cashiers or customer service associates. On top of that, if you happen to ask an associate that only speaks Spanish for help all they do is shrug their shoulders and say, "no abla english" and walk away. Oh and the one that really gets me is their return policy always changes from day to day and even worse by every associate!! I sense some favoritism going on here!! Not okay!! 😡😡<//review><Date>1606099850465</Date><GmapID>0x80db1c9258a1abdf:0xe9dda3cf6db5da70</GmapID><Name>Marissa Fontalvo< /Name><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

< Review>
For the most part the experience was good.  The staff was very nice and helpful.  However, at the check the nightmare began. Because I'm used to taking my own bags to a story I then remembered that Walmart provided bags, as i got to the cashier I was told that they were out of bags. OUT OF BAGS. I was offèred Halloween printed bags, too small, and i was told they were $.80 each. Good thing I had taken my own, but because of COVID I had to bag my own. Then the terminal at the check out would not process my purchase ($392,00) and there was plenty of money in the account. I then had to go to the area for returns for that terminal, however the first cashier had canceled the actual transition instead of just suspending it. I was then sent to another check stand and the entire transaction had to be re-rung and all bagged again using my bags. That's my ordeal.<//Review>

<Text>Today I came into Walmart to pick up 1 hour photos and order a cake from the bakery. When I asked the gentleman at the photo center if he could page someone to the bakery, he said, “no, they leave early.” I told him fine, I would ask someone else for assistance. As I was waiting for someone at the bakery, the lady working the deli yelled, “bakery is closed!” She didn’t Know that I was already being helped. CRYSTAL was incredibly helpful. She assisted me in my order. Crystal was friendly and professional. I frequent this store and it was refreshing having someone like Crystal go out of their way to do their job. Especially when others from other departments were quick to dismiss business and making more profit. Thank you again Crystal!!!< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmapID>

Its okay. But they seriously need to have employees do a walk through of their departments and see how people leave open food containers, dirty diapers or just garbage in the aisles. Plus take time to see if a customer needs help. Not walk away if they ask for help<//text>

I had to buy 1 from another store that night as my daughter had people staying at her place. I asked for a merch credit as she doesn't need 2 of them. They called a manager and walked away. After 10 minutes, I asked if someone was coming,  she said they ALL went to a meeting and if I didn't like it I could call corporate. I asked her why no one let me know they were at a meeting, again, if you don't like it call corporate.....as I'm standing in front of their "great customer service " pledge...<//text>< pictures>

<Review>The staff are some of the greatest and nicest people ever and they get the 5 stars.

WalMart the Company gets 1 star.

They treat people with disrespect by checking receipts at the door before exiting AFTER JUST HAVING PAID! And touching all MY items SINCE I JUST PURCHASED THEM.

They are not great about honoring their own receipts even when they are within the time-frame and Walmart policy. They make up their own rules. Ask the Store Manager to explain it. Only store credit that same day up to $25 or whatever they say and it has to be from the same department (like hardware) as the.return item. This is with no receipt. But, still! They even told me at the Palm Springs location that I should go to any other location and I'd have better luck making my (legitimate) returns.

The prices aren't aligned with the correct items & there's no price tag, just abbreviated names & impossible to find the correct bar codes. So many times it seems purposely done.

The prices have gotten high and while there are certain items which are a bargain a lot of items now cost more than at other stores which don't claim to be discount stores.

Plus, it's inconvenient since more & more items are being locked behind glass & there's usually no one around with the key. Sometimes you press the button over and over waiting for Assistance but no one ever comes. They close the cosmetic and nursery departments early, too

Towards closing in the evening there are only 2 registers open with long lines. There is self checkout but not if you buy beer, alcohol or tobacco products.

Some of the employees are extremely nice and work hard.

I have stopped at Walmart for almost 20 years. I used to love it & defend it when people said they'd never go shop there.

It used to be a great store with a great atmosphere for shopping. It makes me sad how bad this Walmart has become.

I'm starting to find I don't want to shop there anymore myself.</Review>< pics>

<Rate>1<//Rate><review>Once again. My plan was to go to Wal-Mart in order to purchase a water pic for oral hygiene.  For the second time at this particular Palm Springs Wal-Mart, I left without one.

I understand the need to lock down high ticket items due to theft especially in Coachella.  But have at least one person with the key on sight or within 5 mile radius.  I pushed the button, heard the announcement " somebody needed at electric toothbrushes.". Listen to it several times. Spoke with three employees walking about, each expressing " someone on the way." Even went to cosmetic counter which was staffed. She told me same.  After 30 min with two children in tow. I gave up.

Perhaps another Wal-Mart or maybe Amazon, but not Palm Springs Wal-Mart

<review>Worst customer service experience I have ever had without question. Came to pick an order up, wasn't in the system. Asked if I could just grab it off the shelf and cancel my order. Was told sure. Went back to find said item, wasn't stocked, asked for said item and was told "if it's not on the shelf we don't have it" and was dismissed.</review>< pictures>

As always I went for just cat litter and my cat's favorite treats party mix and walked out with more, way more than just my cat litter... prices at times or just irresistible I might not need some of the items now but I know later I will and due to the price being as low as they are it's better to be just stocked up did not have it when I need it... there's only one disappointment today I came home with just the small bags of party mix and not the big container that I normally get I get the plastic container party mix for just $5 vs $9 in town (DHS)<//Text>

<Text>I would say this would be your typical Walmart supercenter. I'd say the biggest challenge is finding someone to help and finding someone who can be effective in their help. The place is so big it's hard to know where everything is. but had an instance where I needed to get a bike repair kit since they were out of bike tubes and it's under a lock cabinet. I pressed the service button and waited and it usually takes anywhere from 5 to 10 minutes. no one came by for 15 minutes. I kept pressing the button but it seemed that no one was answering the call. And I was looking for someone to help and finally found someone who luckily had a key for that cabinet and I was able to get a bike repair kit<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None<//response>< Gmap_id>

Everything you would expect from a typical Walmart. Low stock, ghetto customers, rude staff and messy store. Cant expect more when going to any Walmart.</text>

At the front door it was supposed to be a line but nobody had to wait. You can't try on clothes but you can touch everything. There was a bottle to clean off your cart but you did it yourself so everyone was touching the same bottle. There was no point. Other than that and having to were masks it was a normal Walmart.<//Text>

Terrible customer service. I’ve called this store 4 times to inquire about an office desk and not a single person can assist me. I spoke w an employee in electronics and I’m like, “why in the hell did I get transferred there?!” Anyways the employee couldn’t help me or couldn’t even check if they had one in the system because he had customers in front of him. All he could of done is put me in a brief hold and transfer me over to a supervisor or a manager to assist me but he didn’t.

This is what happens when you hire people for a very low salary. If Walmart were to take care of their employees financially,  maybe they will provide better customer service for their customers. Absolutely terrible customer service. Amazon here I come.</text>

My elderly Mother lost her receipt of a few items. She needed to return them so she went into the store and a guy by the name of "JAVIER" denied her service because she didn't have a receipt. Here is a picture of Walmart's return policy. Items were purchased one week ago. Needless to say I am on my way to speak to a manager.< /text>

<Time>1596233183308</Time><user>106797091749576864413<//user><Review>The contact free order system is quite good. They also have a pickup tower for website orders. That was ok. I didn't have a clear understanding about what to expect. I placed a website order and it was pulled on 2 different days. I scanned my bar code and it said you're all set. But nothing happened! I scanned my bar code again. Again it said you're all set!
As I was standing their scratching my head. An employee came up to me with most of my items. Glad I checked before leaving!!! I had to scan the other bar code of the items that were pulled separately! After scanning that code the tower machine opened a door and low and behold there are my other items! OY! Now that I know what to expect... I'll order for contact free or home delivery! Otherwise the employees are doing a fantastic job! And heroes work at Wal-Mart! They deserve our thanks and better compensation for their hard labor!< /Review></record></dataset><record>

The worst Walmart.  Period.
Dirty.  Empty shelves.  Stock items piled in the aisles.  Signage designed to make you walk Every aisle.  Thoughtless placement of items.  And God forbid that you need an item in a locked case or the Paint department.< /review>

<text>It is so hot and muggy in that store. A lot of the shelves were empty. They didn't even have plain white envelopes on the shelf. What a disgrace especially after being a former Walmart employee. Oh, by the way, in case anyone has something to say, I voluntarily resigned to go full time in the healthcare field.</text></record></dataset><record>

When you ask an associate for help most dont speak English or dont really understand your question because of the language barrier. Also, when items are locked behind glass/plexi glass doors there is no one around to assist you even after calling the store number for help. I have spent over twenty minutes waiting for someone to unlock a case.<//text>< Pictures>

<review>Manager Elizabeth refused to assist me with a gift card and refused to talk to me after she stated she would reimburse me the 15.00 I had because the Walmart gift card was demagnetized. I went to customer service and the female refused to reimburse me stating it was not a gift card even though it had the Walmart logo and the Walmart number on the back. Elizabeth got security involved and security stated she doesn’t want to talk to you. May I know why and he apologized and said she didn’t say. I confronted her and when I asked her for her name she refused and said I don’t have to tell my name as well as the customer service lady. Both were very racist and didn’t help me. I got more help from security then them. They shouldn’t be working there due to their poor customer service. Worst experience ever!!!i wish I could upload the video and picture of the way I was treated!!!< /review>< pics>

Can't believe I'm giving a Walmart a five star review... but I am! This Walmart was absolutely incredible!! First of all, the views of the mountains from the parking lot are amazing. Full disclosure, we slept overnight here in our van, but we were not bothered at all. Overnight the staff cleaned the parking lot keeping it pristine. In the morning, we went to the bathroom and were greeted by fabulous wait staff, they seriously couldn't have been nicer. We grabbed some breakfast and had great small talk with the greeter. Pleasantly surprised by Walmart!</Text>

<Name>Charles Erickson< /Name><response>None< /response><Rating>1</Rating><date>1594610060710< /date><text>I have had multiple issues at this store with the receipt policy. What employees at this location fail to understand, is that Wal Mart Policy does not supercede California State Law.

To (lawfully) detain someone suspected of shoplifting, you must have reasonable evidence that the person has in fact stolen merchandise.

If you physically block someone from leaving the store, telling them you don't suspect them of theft, but you need to see a receipt, is effectively detaining them. The employee, stood in the path of my cart and said I needed to go back and get a receipt. If I would've tried to push my way through it would've been assault. I'm not interested in assaulting anyone or breaking any laws otherwise.

Long story short, head back to the register, only to find out, you can't print a receipt off a machine that's already been used after your transaction? Seems like antiquated technology. Loss prevention says "Let's check the cameras" to which I say "yes check them, how will I be compensated for my time?" And start going on about how I've paid for the items, im being wrongfully accused of theft and being detained, so loss prevention let me go.

These geriatric hall monitors need to learn about the laws of the great nation they've voted into the dumpster over the years. Alas, they will probably sit in their gossip circle at the front of the Wal Mart, robotically marking off receipts as people sheepishly hand them over. Amazing.<//text><user>116105547618410841720<//user>< GmapID>

Wally World is Wally World.  We all know about the savings we get.  However, I hate bad management decisions.

I needed 4 items in the pharmacy center so I of course parked on the pharmacy side of the store.  It was around 9 p.m.  Well, when I got to the door the door was closed for the evening.  No sign saying...... This entrance is closed.  Please use other entrance.  We are sorry for any inconvenience that this may cause you..  Just locked!  I was not the only one that came to that entrance and got upset.

Here is the worst part.  Assuming someone forgot to put the sign up that night....Ill just bet you the sign is probably a 3ft x 3ft sign.  Not nearly large enough to notice from a car.

So here is my suggestion for every Walmart on this planet.  Build a large enough sign that it requires 4 wheels.  Then when closing an entrance you wheel it out and park it in front of the door.  That way customers will notice the door is blocked before they park.

I took a picture of the closed entrance.  Unfortunately I dont see a way to post it<//review>

<Text>We went to get a piece of furniture we saw on line.  It took three attempts to get a clerk to get us a flat cart.  Then we went to get tools for putting it together and they were locked up and the red button box wasn’t lighting up.  Once again we had to go try to find a clerk to unlock the case.  20 minutes later, a rather unpleasant guy came and unlocked the case and handed us the three items.  Now I understand locking the cases because of theft, but at least have a clerk with a key nearby!  Then we go to the self check out and after we rang up the $1.86 tube of glue we, once again had to have a clerk ok that we were able to buy it.  As if all that wasn’t enough, it was a dresser that was on sale for $88 dollars that normally was $129 and it of course rang up at the non sale price and we once again had to get a clerk and show her the sales info and she fixed it.  Oh yes, not a single clerk offered to assist us loading the 70 lb. item into our van.  Fortunately there were shoppers in the parking lot that did and my husband is in his 70’s and I am in a motorized scooter.  The entire experience was so exasperating we may never shop from there again unless it’s online to be delivered!<//Text>< gmapID>

Customers are not supposed to be caring bags for the protection of others due to covid 19 and stores are not supposed to be charging customers for plastic bags however Walmart States they do not have plastic bags so instead of the $0.10 we had to pay in the past now they're charging a $1 per bag. Walmart should be ashamed of itself for price gouging. Walmart if you can't get bags you could at least get some trash bags that you sell so that customers do not have to walk out with their groceries in their hands in unsanitized buggies.< /review>

Most needed items best found in stock during daytime hours.  I could not locate, " LYSOL MACHINE WASH DISINFECTANT."  It must've been out of stock, as I looked for it within Lysol products, machine wash products, and household cleaning supplies.
No where to be seen.........<//review>

I did not feel safe, none of the employees were wiping and sanitizing the carts for the customers to witness. There were no sanitizing wipes or hand sanitizers for the customers. Social distancing was not been practice effectively. The employees where at nearly every aisle stocking the shelves, they were too close to the costumers. Shopping at Walmart was a nervous experience yesterday. Every customer and employee had a facemask on, that was the only positive highlight.<//review>< Time>

One neat thing is they have reusable plastic bags for sale. I didn't need one, so can't tell you the price. But, they're supposed to be good for 125 uses and can be washed. Saw lots of people leaving with clothe bags - nice change to plastic.<//text>< Pics>

<review>Very unhappy with their automotive service. I called about 4:45pm to see if they can patch my tire. They said sure and they do not close till 6. I showed up at 5:05pm and they denied me service saying one of their techs are going home at 5:30 and the other tech is busy on another vehicle. I understand it's Super Bowl Sunday but to turn away customers and tell them they should go to Pep Boys. Very unacceptable.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None</response>< gmapID>

<Review>Last week I had to make a large purchase of school supplies for 134 students. I just want to thank the Customer Service manager Denise for helping us through this big order like it was nothing. You are a great manager! Also Assisant Manager (female/tall) in clothing department who was the only person working the floor who knew where we could find certain priced backpacks and was willing to help us.  Thank you to these two ladies and because of these two ladies we will be back every year with bigger orders.<//Review>< Pics>

<review>Store opens at 6:00 a.m. and we were there when an open the automotive department opens it 7 but 1 of the men came in at 6:30 and was eager to help us so that we would be 1st in line. He looked into computer for the tires and we needed and then physically went upstairs and check the tires so the table are absolutely in the inventory. This gentleman's name was Kurt and he was so very helpful. Over all service and the price was exceedingly above what we had expected.

We are now on the road with road hazard insurance and feel much more comfortable driving a dancer at a 115ﾟ.

I joined the automotive market manager about the great share boosted we had and I also took time to call the 800 number and get them in upDate on Wonderful service.

<Text>Sooo many wonderful choices!
Necessities, wishes, wants & needs . . . they are all here!
Household items, personal needs, cosmetics, sports, clothing, hardware items, furniture, linens, food, snacks and many more.
This is more than a store, it is a life style.
I highly recommend giving it a try . . . and don't let the enormity of the store frighten you, embrace & enjoy it...it is quite an adventure!</Text>< pictures>

This is a great Walmart Supercenter.  My wife found several items of interest and all-in-all we had a very pleasurable shopping experience.  This was just one of our many shopping destinations on this day but I believe this stop topped all the others.  We found what we needed - Thank you</Review>

I came here for a cell phone charging cable.  I sort of knew I was wasting my time because I've been here before.  But low and behold the person in electronics actually knew what she was talking about.  I couldn't believe her explanation though as to why the shelves in the cell phone accessory section are always empty.  Hello!?!  Are you even TRYING to compete with Amazon?!?!  Don't forget the advantages you have as a brick and mortar but if you don't have it in stock, forget it.  I'm going with Amazon.  She tells me they're always out of stock because a human doesn't do the ordering then something about the odd quantity of the cases.  Come on Wal Mart.  You have all the resources in the world to make sure you never have an item out of stock.  As it is you NEVER have these items in stock.  Losing millions.   The Walton's would be pissed.  It's ok.  Bezos is happy to take your money.  I like him better than a Walton anyway.  Ciao Walmart</Text>

No deaths or obvious injuries reported on Black Thursday 2017. Crew had the store on lock. Looked like a tight ship compared to previous holiday experiences at this location. But they totally ran out of carts later on< /review>

As a handicapped person it was a bit difficult to maneuver around as there were pallets of merchandise everywhere blocking walk ways. I am not talking of the pallets with merchandise that were for sale. I am talking about pallets of boxes that needed to be stocked. I understand that  you must restock but this was at 2pm to 3:30 PM in the afternoon in a packed store. But I must say the employees on the floor were very kind and friendly and also very helpful.< /Text>

It's not Walmart's fault but it's just too crowded the shop and people are just antisocial they don't care if you're in front of them going back to the smaller mom and pop stores they need the money</Review>

<text>Shopping was great except the gentleman at self checkout. I asked told him that some items had fell on the ground and he replied okay and kept on working I guess it's safe to say that.then the register needed a code which he had no clue how to do it
Then he said he was waiting for a manager. In the mean eat security guard asked if I needed help and took me to a different register. They were very helpful and got me out in time to catcy bus.  The guys name was Devin btw. I'm not sure why he was working self checkout? I hope next time I have a better experience.<//text><rate>2</rate>< Pics>

Thank you.this store has been kind to the community.i went to the clearnce section and was met by a king employee, KYLE.KYLE.he was very approachable, and helpful.he even helped me sort through boxes of toys from a pallet to the shelves.39 items on my receipt later, i wanted to take a moment to say....thanks kyle! We often will yelp or review very fast to beat up a negative experience, but expect excellent service a given.its either in the employee or not.lets recognize the ones who give there joy in there job, even if bosses are busy not to see, now they know and read!!! I like the overall crew and vibe!!! Thanks, robert</review>

No one at deli to help us.  The male clerk completely ignored us and hid behind the wall.  Bunch of losers.  I hate Wal-Mart but only game in town.  Dreadful.  If you read further down list of comments same experiences....loser customer service and employees.</Text>

No grocery carts on 1 side, walked to the other side and found a handful. Long lines always unless you self check out. I swear to myself I'll never go back everytime I go there. We need a Winco on the west end of the Coachella Valley!<//text>

This place is always a cluster****... employees passing by you, no nod, no eye to eye contact, no greeting.  There was a woman in the garden dept supposedly greeting customers...not a word, no smile forget about making you welcome.... the cashier that checked me out BARELY  spoke English, very hard to understand so communication was at a limit....
I once worked for Walmart and it is not up to the standards we had to abide by....sad!
Limits my trips to Walmart to a couple of times a year....I will travel farther and out of my way than to go to Walmart's< /Text>

Would give a negative zero if I could. Just had the absolute worst experience in the automotive department. I came in at 7:30 AM and was told they had the tires I requested and I would be able to pick up my car in 2 hours. Two and a half hours passed and I came back to be told my car hadn’t been touched and would be another hour. One more hour passed and I got a call that the tire I ordered was actually out of stock and I would have to pay for the more expensive one. I had to call in work to be another hour late and lose that pay only to be given an $11 discount. I had also specifically asked that one tire that wasn’t bad would be saved as a sore and be placed in my trunk. Though I was assured this would happen I drove home an hour away only to realize it wasn’t there. I then had to drive all the way back wasting gas. So my 194$ tire change cost me over $240 in lost wages and gas. NEVER using Wal Mart again though I know this place doesn’t care because they have sooo many customers, what is one persons unpaid bills?< /Review>

<review>Using the Walmart app to find grocery items really helps economize our time in the store. Makes it easier to know that you have looked in the right places and it  made us aware of in-stock items like Hershey Giant chocolate bars that we might have otherwise missed. Checkout and using the Walmart app and Savings Catcher is still painful and confusing at the time - checkout - when you feel most rushed. Add in the bagging hassle - using your own bags or buying Walmart bags - and checkout reduces an otherwise 4 star experience to 3 stars.< /review>< user>

It's a superstore, so there's usually a pretty large selection of items, although sometimes they don't restock some of my regular brands in the market. The staff is friendly & helpful.< /review>

According to the Federal Trade Commission "In many jurisdictions, companies are legally required to charge no more than the advertised or shelf price for a product, so good pricing practices are important for both costumer satisfaction and a company's bottom line". Walmart, does not seem know that :) It is the SECOND time that they mess up, they advertise a product in their store with the incorrect price, when I show up to customer service, I receive the worst customer service ever. Get some manners, please. Stop hiring uneducated and rude people. The manager is very hostile and rude as well, I am beyond upset. Walmart, you are a the world's LARGEST company by revenue ($500 billion). Does it really hurt you to grant your customer the price that is being advertised? No. The difference was less than $20 both times. I have gone to much smaller companies that respect the advertised price, it is the mistake of YOUR worker, not the customer. It is the last time I attend this store.<//Text>

Posted closing was midnight but NOT for returns! Got there at 10:08 and they said that returns closed at 10pm.
I didn’t realize that each department had different closing times. It would be helpful if that information was posted.</text>

<Response>None</Response><Text>One would think Walmart would have a standard operating procedure that it enforces country wide. I went into this facility to return something I purchased the day before, and they would not give a refund without the receipt. I admitted that I misplaced the receipt and asked for a gift card, because I am not from California, but the only option they provided was to swap for something with a similar cost total.  That wouldn't be a problem if it weren't for the fact that I'm flying back home. Without a doubt the worst experience I have had with ANY Walmart<//Text>< user_name>

Horrible service. You call and no one ever picks up unless you let it ring 200 times! Then finally they answer then transfer you to your department and then wait ANOTHER 200 rings--ridiculous!< /Review>

<date>1569542990590<//date><Rate>1</Rate><Text>I came to store to replace a damaged road side assistance  tier a couple times, because the tier machine wasn't working.
They did't have the size of my tier , so I ordered from them and I asked about price, the manager told me that I don't have to pay any difference because a new tier was cheaper price. Finally, when I come to pick up the car they told me that I have to pay a half price of the tier. I  just don't know why they didn't call me before if I have any difference to pay, so I'll  know in advance. My original tier was more price than a new and store didn't have that brand in stock, so why do I have to pay for that, when I was told that I don't have any difference. I was so disappointed when I left that store.<//Text>< Pics>

I don't understand how this place stays so busy and so crowded but they won't get more electric scooters for elderly and disabled.  Then if you do decide to wait on one then you end up waiting almost two hours.  They tell you that employees are outside looking for them but then you see two or three shoppers ride in on them.  They need a better system.<//text>

<Review>This WM is awful....we have lived all over the south and southwest and in mid-America (including Bentonville, AR. The home base of WM). This store is too hot...empty shelves, never know if what you are accustomed to buying there will even be in stock. Slow SLOW, cashiers. The young man that helped us today acted as though we were such a bother because we have a wheelchair, a basket, and a LEGAL service dog ( there are never electric cars for the disabled.  Heavy people using them cause they can't walk)  OK..I don't see that as a disability.....so WM...you need more carts!!!!!!!Because your policies on electric cars needs to be changed or invest in MORE THEN!!!
I WILL AVOID THIS WM AT ALL COSTS!!!< /Review><Rating>1<//Rating>< gmapID>

Terrible service.  In looking for shoes for my daughters promotion, inventory was inaccurate. Shoes were split thrown on floor and very low inventory. In trying to get  an associate to help everyone walked by on break and stating someone else would help.  After waiting the first 15 minutes I asked if they could call someone over on the radio. I was told to go find someone in fitting rooms . After 30 minutes i just went to customer service who also gave the incorrect details regarding inventory stock< /Review>

<Review>Several of the employees were extraordinarily helpful. One guy was collecting carts when we arrived. He saw my mom needed an electric cart but none were available. So, he went out into the parking lot running to find her one. A few minutes later he returned with one for her. Another woman, who was wearing a Walmart cape took us across the store to find the exact product we were looking for. Overall, one of our best trips to any store.<//Review>< Gmap_id>

If and when they actually have items in stock it can 🥫 be a decent place to shop 🏪. It is frequently out  of stock of many items when I shop. The help is slow at best and they frequently shut down 👇 the rotisserie chicken 🐔 oven early because they want to go home 🏡 early. Many times they are out of chickens all together. I find this store 🏬 to be very poorly run.</text>

Horrible service. Placed an order and wasn't ready. They said they were out of it. I went back and got the product and repaid for it. AND had to pay more!!! Yucca Valley Walmart is much more efficient.<//Text>

Walmart has great products for the public to purchase but employee guest interations feel cold and unwelcomed. Not a fan of the personnel but live shopping for itmes I need
If only they good work on friendly staff, that would be fantastic!<//Text>

< Review>
Went to get the tires balanced. They had no socket for my standard truck, so cancelled the job. Wasted time. They sell the fricking sockets. This is mismanagement of the tire center, and of the store manager for allowing this to happen. I also drove a long way here, and had to disconnect my trailer. What a way to waste a day.<//Review>

<text>The very nice Supercenter it's got its issues especially with the labeling of Isles. Also I've had difficulties with the cell phone representative and I saw that management was working on that to get somebody that knew what they were doing better. A good thing. I go there often they have from A to Z. Automotive service, online groceries with a grocery pickup, Hardware, paints, a Garden Center, Sporting Goods, clothing. Shoes & much more I find it as a reasonable place to make a One-Stop shop. Another good thing is Security's tight in parking lot . Along with plenty of parking, plenti of handicapped parking. And very much well handicapped access. I must say for myself I find this one of the best Supercenters that I've been to.</text>< rate>

This location has come along way over the last few years. It was starting to become disorderly and unkempt. Though management had made the effort to improve the quality of the location and the quality performance of the employees. I feel like this location is definitely busier than others I the valley, but, still very affordable of many items.< /review>

Yeah I’ve been trying to get a job here for a very long time. I keep having to renew my applications. I call this Walmart almost everyday to try and talk to personnel but no one ever answers it’s getting ridiculous. I ask for a manager none of the employees can even do that for me. It’s very inconvenient.</text>

Well , what can you say about Walmart.... their sales people are as knowledgable about the products they sell , as Trump is knowledgable about hurricanes !! I like Walmart , but when I went to buy a T.V. They didn"t have the product in stock nor did they know when they would have it in stock again ! Also she didn't know much about electronics.< /review>

losing parts of my car and saying they needed to double-check with the technician to make sure that my parts were there to begin with and had me wait for 3 and 1/2 hours in order for them to produce a piece of paper that said that it was not there at the time I brought my car and they claim they have it on video that they were able to see the technician put my battery into the car and not have to untie unattach it but my car wasn't actually parked inside the bay it was parked right outside the door so I don't know what's going on but I would take a picture of anything that you turn in to get work on there because they'll try to rip your parts off and sell them back to you<//text>

Pay employees minimum wage, you get minimum effort. Bought an xbox . i lost recipt . sucks but i have proof on my debit card with a valid ID and its under 14 days. They wont let me return it. If i need a razor case opened it takes 30 min. But give them a chance to tell a customer NO on something they all jump on THAT in a heart beat.<//text>

<review>As usual large empty holes in shelves that have been that way for at least a week. Prices missing or just not put on products. Can't find staff or are met with "I don't know" and/or a blank stare. It used to be annoying now I have just come to expect it. It's clear the ring master lost control long ago and what's left are, on the best of days, the ones simply there as a prop rather than an actual participant in the all to real reasoning for consumers heading to their electronic devices and Amazon rather than brick and mortar stores.</review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><Gmap_id>0x80db1c9258a1abdf:0xe9dda3cf6db5da70</Gmap_id></record>

<Text>THE MOST DISRESPECTFUL EMPLOYEE. This cashier name DAVE Is the RUDEST PERSON EVER. After he made a mistake by over scanning the items I bought, He Yelled at me just because I Questioned and Corrected him to void it. And the Assistant Manager name ANTHONY Doesn’t know how to handle Customers Complain, Even though he Admitted to the Supervisor that he Yelled at me. He told me to wait until he’s done with his shift just to talk to him. I’ve been a Customer for 20 years and I shopped here twice a week because I owned a Care Home Facility but now I have to shop elsewhere because of this Bad Experience with this Employees.< /Text><pics>None</pics>< resp>

Mani pedi area the man that did my pedi did such a lazy job as soon as he saw a regular come in he rushed to do my pedi and left my nails with nail polish all around my toes. Charged 19. Shouldn't have given him anything because all he did was wash my feet and paint my toes. Smh very disappointed.< /Review>

Cosmetics is for some reason separate from the rest of the store so u have to go through the cash twice👎👎👎
Plus the person in the cosmetics was obnoxious. I ended up leaving and bought nothing!!!!
Big waste of time< /text>

I just spent about two hours shopping on your store.  Picking up items through out the store. When I went to check out, I went to the area where my car was parked.  Looked for a cash register and was told by the clerk I could check my self out.  Would have been easy had I had a,couple items but my cart was very full.  I told her no and she could have cared less. I walked out, told her she could put it back. I will shop where there is service. Prices are really no different.< /Review>

Shelves half full in the maket department Frozen food department is also half full. Unable to find thing you needed.
Some of the Bakery goods had molded on them. Few employees to help you find anything. The store is badly stocked. You really need new  management to run the store because you are losing customers.</Text>

This walmart is ok. I stay away at the beginning and end of the month because it gets crazy. All the fruit and vegetables are pricey and in bad shape. I'd rather buy the veggies and fruit at aldi's across the street. But like everyone else in this county, they need more cashiers.<//review>

This place is awful they treat all the minorities like thief's and some old geezer tried putting hands hands on my one time even thou I had a receipt for everything I had. Then ended up falling down and almost broke a hip... I think he's a drunk or something but I will pray for him for sure.  Avoid this place at all costs<//text>

This is a decent Walmart.  The location is convenient and you can do one stop shopping of groceries, clothing, Auto supplies, etc.  Even get new tires while you shop.  The pharmacy seems to always be busy.  The store is clean and kept in order.  Checkout lines can be a little wait, but the self checkout registers help if you don't have a lot of items.</Review>

<rate>1</rate><review>One star is 10  too many! I absolutely hate this Walmart.  The customer service sucks. Just about everything is locked up behind glass. Employees will walk by and ignore the fact you are wanting to buy a item that might only cost 2$. The only way to get them to open the glass is to cover the camera. Which are in reach.
The area of the store next to Mc Donald's is now gated and alarmed so you only enter from that entrance unless you go thru checkout. I was shopping there today and wanted to leave my cart to buy a drink at McDonalds before heading to the garden center checkout and was informed after setting the alarm off that I can no longer go that way even empty handed. I was told that this was a cooperate decision. That is absolutely ridiculous that they treat everyone that comes into that store like a thief. My days of shopping at that store are over and walmart in general limited.<//review><pics>None</pics>< response>

The lady I talked to on the phone was extremely rude and unprofessional. I called to see if they have any weighted blankets in stock, a product they carry in their store (which shows how knowledgeable they are about the items they sell), and she said what’s that and I explained it’s a heavy blanket that comes in different weights. She laughed and said if I ask someone if we have weighted blankets they’ll laugh in my face. So rude.< /text>

You need it,  most likely Wal-Mart has it. *Just because you ask any employee if they carry something and they say no. You might want to check yourself. I found what I needed. Maybe she didn't understand my English¿ I thought she understood me, but now I'm not so sure. Oh well they had it 😁<//text>

<Review>While the employees are friendly and helpful, the store tends to have mostly long lines with only so many cashiers working registers at which point you are then forced to use self-checkout in order to get out within a decent amount of time; self-checkout also tends to be overly-filled. Frustrating that you are pressed to do a store's job when you go for groceries such as ring up and bag your own items. Last I checked that's what the store should be doing-supplying the workers. If I wanted to do this, I would still work retail. Over the last months, the employee operated registers have dwindled as the self-checkout registered have increased...time to look for a new store to shop.</Review><Pics>None</Pics>< time>

<Rating>3<//Rating><review>Lots of items to choose from... good prices. But sometimes when you have questions or want to ask for an item, staff are nowhere to be found or it will take you a while to find one. It's a waste of time looking for one, and sometimes when you find one... not customer friendly. Smile should be one of the slogans. One would wonder about the management, cause it reflects them. Just a thought. Other than that Wal-Mart has a lot to offer... Productwise. (p.s. just my observation, I do shop at PS Walmart) I don't like to write a negative review, but sometimes it helps with the improvements.<//review>< pictures>

<Review>Big store.  Comparable to other Walmarts except this store has a very small little girls clothing section.  I dont know why, but it was very disappointing as that was the focus of my shopping trip.  I couldn't find hardly anything nice for my 6 yr old granddaughter to wear.<//Review>< pics>

Not as much liquor selection compared to smaller stores like Albertsons. Love that you can deposit so many coins. Self serve. checkouts make it so convenient and the large parking lots makes it easy to shop here. Also noticed they don't carry a very popular card game called Wizard. Prices still so good . Never have to worry about overpaying at walmart</Text>

The manager Emma in service is completely unpleasant and should never work with customers
She's made her own rule saying no return without a receipt period said its been her rule a month now
Well the sign on the wall says Wal-Mart is happy to return with or without one

Wanted to return a speaker poorly recommended by staff. I was stopped at door and told I was required to have a small yellow sticker to procede to customer service with my product AND receipt. Apparently the receipt and product IS NOT ENOUGH TO NOT BE THOUGHT A THEIF. I am done ever shopping in this store ever again until they can figure out a loss prevention policy that doesn't infringe on even the basic respect of their customers. No only did I not purchase the sound bar for my TV here, I will not shop here anymore at all. Bonnie, the manager is an incompetent shill who enforces rules she doesn't even understand nor can even explain. Wal-Mart employs specific staff with no other purpose than to annoy customers to mitigate the overwhelming incompetence of the staff to limit theft. I'm done supporting this garbage business model. I'll go out of my from now on to avoid any Wal-Mart shopping. Stop rewarding this idiot corporate monster.<//Text>

<rating>5</rating><Text>This is a Super Wal-Mart so what can you say? If you want a small, unique, artsy store this obviously isn't for you. If you don't want to navigate thousands of square feet of merchandise to find what you need, this store isn't for you. Based on my visit today I have many positive things to say however. Parking lot is huge. They seem to literally stock every mass produced item under the sun. Because the store is so huge, I had to repeatedly ask an employee where I could find what I needed, and to my very pleasant surprise, EVERY employee was extremely polite, courteous and helpful, which runs counter to what I've heard and sometimes experienced with other Wal-Mart stores. This store was spotlessly clean and I was able to find every item on my extensive list, although as I stated before,  I had to repeatedly ask for help because the store is so large. There was absolutely no wait at checkout. So, based on my experience today, I give this store five stars!!</Text>< Pictures>

<Review>Most stuff is constantly out of stock.  Employees never can give you an answer to a question they should know since they are the ones who work there. And check out lines always have old slow people as cashiers. Put some pep in that scan and get on it..<//Review>< name>

<review>Part 1
This particular location has the highest rate of loss inventory in the entire western district.  Therefore it has made the staff a bit less friendly than most. They have become suspicious of even their regular customers. The store just doesnt have the same feeling of what Wally the founder intended for his stores.    It's a shame and we all need to  look around our nation, as well as around the world, to see how life is changing for all of us.  Its not just the employee at Walmart but it has affected  all areas of life. Everyone & Everywhere has an element of concern about safety and corruption.
We all have locks on our homes, cars, & some even carry personal alarms or protection. What are we protecting ourselves from the sad answer is from other human beings.
I'll stop with asking whom ever reads this what you think will come of society as a whole if something doesnt change to better human contact & relations with one another?
P.S. & it is probably a bigger issue than our local Walmart Store. Thank you!l</review>< gmap_id>

Went to get supplies but most were gone lots of empty shelves. No toilet paper and hardly any paper towels and no hand sanitizer and no Clorox wipes. It was weird to see so many empty shelves. But I found other things I was looking for and then stopped at McDonald's to get something to eat.</review>

<review>This is one of the better walmart in this area because the employees are helpful, know the store and products and seem to be fully stocked...I asked an employee for help in reaching something and she went and got a ladder, and was cheerful doing it.  Definitely a great experience shopping here!</review><username>dorie koch<//username><gmap_id>0x80db1c9258a1abdf:0xe9dda3cf6db5da70< /gmap_id>< user>

Never had a problem with this store until today. The black gay guy at the self check out was so rude and condescending and even told the front greeter to check my bags because he thought I stole something. The front greeter, HIS NAME IS ALEX stay away from him! Hes terrible at his job and needs a new one. Super rude. I had to tell him how to check my things because he was so clueless. After 10 minutes he finally admitted i didnt steal anything!  He doesnt need to be working in customer service and even told a few people rude thing as he wa as scanning in receipts. STAY AWAY FROM THIS MAN. HE WILL CUSS YOU OUT AND THEN DENY IT RIGHT AFTER! He even pushed my cart with MY KID IN IT trying to block me like a kid from leaving. Unacceptable and the police will be involved. ASSAULT! Harrassment charges will come soon for him.< /text>

Today 4/23/19 @6pm I arrived at the Palm Springs Walmart , what I thought would be a simple return , turned out to be more about the mangers pride , judgment and a hour of our time   , we purchased a scooter April 7 , we gave the scooter as a gift to my girlfriends son , he injured himself the first time using it . the wheel locked up on him , upon my examination i did see that his scooter had a defect on the front wheel , the bearing was tweaked ,  that happened  some how during his first ride to test it out before he took it to the skatepark , he fell pretty hard , we did take him
To the er  because he was complaining about his injuries ,
Fast-forward to today we go in for the return we explain all This and with the original receipt in hand , first the employee at the counter was very nice she wanted to help but she did want the managers approval , so a assist manager (NORBERT) comes to help , from the moment he came he already started to tell me he wasn't going to accept The return , he said because it had  wear on it that it wasn’t returnable and that if he accepted that return,  he would lose his job and the store would lose money . He finally tried to settle and say they’d give me store credit but not the currency I paid them ?!? So we called corporate and they talked with us and let us know that it’s up to the store to decide if they want to accept, the manager was the one that asked us to call corporate and have them override it .
when corporate called the assistant manager he lied and said he didn’t want to accept the return and disregarded the point of why we called them in the first place , so back to square one.  no return, fine . we leave go to Indio Walmart .Guess what? No questions asked return done . In less then 5 mins , so why couldn’t of that happened in Palm Springs ? I really feel like from The beginning we where stereo typed and judged , I never said anything rude I was calm and very sincere the whole time but Norbert kept giving me a runaround about why he can’t accept the return , he was not providing any  customer service he was more worried about his own employment when he wasn’t even doing anything wrong to begin with , we had a receipt and it was way within the 90 day time frame . I feel like Walmart needs to reevaluate  Norberts employment , he just cost the palm springs location  $16,000 + this year. Our family  of 11 well we did come her as a regular but not after today.  We will shop for our grocery’s and hygiene else where , Norbert lacks customer service or knowledge of the return policy , he should retrain and only be paid accordingly until he can handle being assist manager , id like a response as soon as possible , thanks !<//Text>

<text>2 Stars only because every time I go you can never figure out which is the do-it-yourself checkout you can never figure out which one is cash only there's no sign ,
you always have to ask not everyone has debit cards or credit cards the machine will tell you cards only no cash how stupid is that u should have a choice at the time of checking out .
i even ask the worker that assist  when you need help I asked him if this machine accepts cash he said I don't know you just have to wait and see. smfh.< /text>< pics>

Compared to some, this location is just fine, but...in the valley, it's in last place (not including neighborhood markets, as that wouldn't be comparing the same thing!)

Shoplifters and other things, I'm sure, have put a cloud over this location. The people come across as less friendly, more stressed and seemingly less satisfied than those at other locations.

As a result, it's not as nice to visit when you add in that there seems to be a bit more chaos, mess and uncleanliness, on top of it all.</Review>

<Text>Don't bother going here if you just want to pop in and pickup a couple of items.  I needed a couple items from the bicyvle dept and the tool Department.. i had to wait 5 min for someone unlock the cases to get the 2 items i needed.. then they informed me that they had to escort me to a register to pay for the items. I explained that i still had more shopping to do and they said i had to leave them at the register and then go shop and come back. To the same register..  ABig waist of time.. Walmart security is out of control... I will not come back to thos store... Ever!  I would advise people to shop at smaller stores whenever possible... I am done feeding this mega corp.< /Text>< pictures>

<Text>Generally a clean place except for the bathrooms. You might want to hold it until you get home. The store is often, OFTEN out of many products. Inventory taking really needs improvement. If Wal-Mart is using a 'just in time' inventory system, it's not working. However, generally the prices are low and that's why I shop there.</Text><Rating>4< /Rating>< Pictures>

Its a good Wal-Mart that has lots of goodies. Ranging from snacks, candy, drinks, food, etc. To clothes and shoes for men, women, and little children. Electronics to sporting goods and some party supplies.<//review>

Have been shopping here for years and have had almost no problems with this Wal-Mart. I would go here specifically for the customer service. But I recently bought an item that had previously been returned. Which I didnt notice till I got home and saw all the extra clear wrapping. So I open it to make sure everything is in there and im missing 2 of the 3 pieces of the item. Unfortunately I lost my receipt so I would have been fine with store credit but I was told no. Even though it was their fault and even though it said they would on their website.<//Text>

Horrible, I mean don't get me wrong I LOVE Walmart, but for God sake I don't want to have to learn Spanish to be able to ask where in the hell is an item or nearly all the items Im seeking as the shelves are a disaster all packaging from open and stolen items or half stolen items and loads of damaged marked down items are filling the shelves more than normal new condition product like you'd expect to find  when you go shopping. Employees either can't understand you to communicate with, and those capable of it are to dumb to waste your patience on. Love Walmart but the palm springs one is way out of tune. I'd expect to see that sort of condition out of a desert hot springs location not a palm springs one. Or is Walmart been taken over by the dream homes gang now too? Because that would explain it< /text>

These are the stupidest slowest employees of any Walmart I have ever been to. I do not recommend buying anything from this place as it is probably outdated and not very clean either judging by how pathetic the staff is. Wal marts are everywhere and it's well worth your time to just go to a different one. Even if it's 20 miles away.</review>

<Review>I always enjoy coming to this Walmart and spend half my time here but today we experienced the worst customer service!! We purchased an amount of 45.70$ and put in 20 in cash , but the machine on self check out stopped functioning. & we had called the lady in charge of the area over to find out they just wanted to give us 15 dollars cheating us out of 5$. Lady continued and called another lady called Karen and Marelene I believe was her name , super unprofessional no apologies and talking about us right when we were a foot away from them, Took 20 minutes to come back with ‘ checking security camaras’ and only gave us 15 dollars !! When we had put in 20. Which if we put ‘ 15’ as they claimed how did we have 25 left to pay in card? Which they did not even bother to double check the system. Once we settled with only 15 dollars they gave us and not 20 the other machine stopped working AGAIN not just for us but the customers Infront of us as well. Very disrespectful for us!!!< /Review><Name>Nikki H<//Name>< resp>

Store is clean and well stocked.

I don’t like that the corporate structure sucks and it doesn’t compensate its employees fairly.

I was a little taken aback reading a woman’s post (here) where she’s complaining about the overhead music alternating between Spanish and English. She stated ‘everyone visiting the US knows English is the language’. Wake up woman; you’re in California, most of us are in acceptance of cultural diversity.

Personally, I like listening to multi cultural music.

Good job, Walmart employees!
Sorry your corporate bosses suck, but hey, they gotta make a living and get a return to their investors. Too bad they don’t seem to care much for the working man and woman.<//Text>< pics>

<Text>Do not use their online order pickup. I ordered an above ground pool on Wednesday 5/9 and My order was supposed to be ready for pickup on Friday 5/11 after 6pm. I called yesterday 5/12 around 12noon and was being transferred back and forth for 15 minutes because I was trying to check on the status of my order. I was told by the guy on the phone that my order won’t be ready until Monday 5/14. I later received a text message two hours later that my order was ready. Very very very very incompetent staffs. They seem not to care. I believe the guy on the phone did not even check on the status of my order. He just made up a pick up date, just to get me off the phone.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

It was ok. Not enough checkers.
Had to wait quite a while.
My question is this: "Why are there so many check stands and no one on them?"
It's not like this company is broke!!!

< Review>
I witnessed a male cashier named Sean tell a female customer tonight that she shouldnt shop there, she needed to go get another cake herself, etc AFTER SEAN SMASHED IT and when another customer told him he was being a b**** to her for no reason, the cashier told her to f*** off and it was a yelling match... A public yelling/name calling match in front of a lot of customers and CHILDREN. Then the lady told him she wanted to talk to his manager and Sean said HE WAS A MANAGER! Is this how Walmart treats their customers?? Especially after I saw this lady waiting in line for almost half an hour, because I was also in line, and for him to have an attitude and blurt out rude things when he literally smashed her cake while he was ringing it up. I didnt stay to see if another manager was called up... but this is uncalled for behavior, ESPECIALLY BY A SO CALLED MANAGER. I also work in customer service and you are NEVER allowed to talk to a customer that way. She wasnt being rude in the first place so what was wrong with this employee I have no clue. Second guessing shopping here anymore. I hope corporate, the Veteran store manager and more managers look at this review, pull video footage and discipline Sean the Associate accordingly!< /Review>

Always enjoy my shopping experience at this store , although my most recent experience included stepping in dog poop !!
If customers are going to bring in dogs , they should make sure to clean up after them if they have an accident !!<//text>

One time I found a gallon of milk when I went into the changing room. This place gives off a vibe of an Adultswim Series. But if the prices really aren't bad at all. But don't try to get in and out really quick, it's not a fast place.<//review>

Your typical large box retailer.  Service is mostly absent--but improving.  I shop their for pharmacy items and toiletries.  I've tried the food section but find the quality lacking and prices moderate--sale prices elsewhere are better.< /text>

Produce quality has dropped in theast 2 months.. i stopped buying produce and buy it elsewhere.. Red, Yellow, and Orange peppers  are soft most times. Bought radishes and it was like they had been frozen before, not crisp when you bite into them. WATERMELON... last 2 i bought were mushy inside.. someone needs to do quality control here.......<//review>

<text>It's a good store with a lot of options and groceries, electronics and pretty much everything you want in a superstar. However, the staff needs better customer service training and is often uninformed about changes that are happening in the company. Make sure you check the hours before you go because it is not 24 hours.</text>< Pics>

<UserId.>110829294484419237670< /UserId.><review>Went to the pharmacy to get needles for a diabetic relative as a favor. Was treated like some drug addict looking for needles. Not sure if racially motivated. It bothered me. I told them i could provide a license or passport because they stated they could only sell if i could provide identification and then they changed the story to someone who can be identified as a regular. Wal-Mart is hot garage. I came to visit from Seattle and will never go into one again. If i could give less stars I would.
I'm not even mad about not getting those needles. The terrible treatment is what really bothered me. Go to Target. Less racists and are allowed in Seattle as they pay their employees well and relatively have better business practices.</review>< user_name>

Customer service is the worse. But then again it's a Walmart so you know you're not doing the because of the service. Think I'll start doing more shopping on Amazon. It's cheaper and you don't have to deal with the headaches.<//text>

Walmart is Walmart. I guess it depends on where you live, whether or not you must be checked at the door, like they do at Sam's Club or Costco. I go to another part of the area and to another Walmart and you are treated totally different. Wonder why? Almost like Profiling the customers or putting all of customers in same group of the "Bad".< /Review>

Really big Walmart!
I am only giving this place three stars because despite the fact that the store has everything at reasonable prices,  the place locks customer service all across the board. The majority of its employees are always in a bad mood,  in general their customer service SUCKS. Specially in the pharmacy.</Text>

<review>Needed a phone charger. The young man working the register in electronics said he'd be right there to unlock display.  After waiting on 3 people, he still ignored me & my husband. There were a total of 7 walmart associates behind the register  also!  The man in front of us even commented that we were before him!  WE WERE NEVER WAITED ON!  WE ARE SHOPPING AT TARGET NOW.</review><user>105099140247542124786< /user>< user_name>

It be great if their shelves where stock empty shelves. Trying to get help to long or they act like they are busy, lazy associate talking about customer service they need training on how to talk to a customer. Point is if you don't like your job look for another one there's someone to fill your spot who is willing to work and if you don't have the patience to work with the public service employment is not for you. Have some manners.< /Text>

<Review>Quick at finding what i needed, just didnt like that i couldn't purchase alcohol in the self check out line even though I have done it before. You just have to show your ID to the person on duty. Also didn't like that I had to purchase bags to put my groceries in compared to another Wal-Mart nearby I didn't have to purchase my bags.< /Review>< GmapID>

<text>I know Walmarts don't really have very high standards, but this one is absolutely disgusting. We had just eaten at the McDonald's there and decided to stop by the bathrooms before shopping. I had to wipe down my toilet seat before I could go because it was practically covered in urine, and the floor was covered I'm toilet paper. Some of it even looked used! According to my boyfriend, the men's bathroom was even worse. He stepped in an actual pile of poop on the floor. When he alerted an associate about what happened and that the bathrooms needed to be cleaned, they just looked annoyed and didn't even give him a clear response. Shopping here is one thing, but if you've gotta go, better hold it until you get home!< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

The store was nice and clean.  Shopping right after New Years with the store in transition from the holidays was not a good idea. To many empty shelves to look at.< /review>

<text>Our company bought $2500 worth of gift cards and several of them got hacked.  The Manager didn't want to report the incident since I have been the only one to complain about the situation.  But how do you know if there are other complaints if you won't take my complaint??. The gift cards were obviously copied.  We are making a police report and fighting the charges for the whole transaction with the Bank. BEWARE AND DONT BUY ANY GIFT CARDS FROM THIS COMPANY!!!!!  The gift cards were used at locations hundreds of miles away.< /text><username>Honestly Fair Google Reviewer</username>< Resp>

As usual Walmart has plenty of displays but no product. Went in for an umbrella they have over 23 displays, and 5 of the ugliest umbrellas that aren't even displayed in stock. One thing Walmart always has in stock or plenty of excuses!< /review>

Not the greatest selection. Always have super long lines. Have stood in line for forty minutes with out other lanes opening. Is clean though and usually can get the cashiers to have a pleasant conversation.<//Text>

You have got to be kidding me Wal-Mart! So disappointing, the lack of customer service is pathetic. Upon entering the store I was not even close to greeted, more like scorned. Then at "customer service" they informed me that they don't do returns anymore w/o a reciept. Then when I asked for a manager she informed me that it has to be an even exchange, ok np. Still waiting for her to get back after explaining nothing and giving nothing to solve current situation.. Now assistant manager Narnia just walked away and said she has other things to do right now. Wow... Unbelievable that they can treat people like they don't exist!< /review>

I used to love this walmart! NOW it SUCKS. Ive been a customer for 10 years!! But this last visit i wanted to return 2 items worth about $25..  I thought I had the receipt but I couldn't find it so I was informed by the employee that because I didn't have the receipt I had to only get an exchange for something from the same Department which I didn't want I just wanted a refund for the whole store or my money back. That is the WOSRT return policy i have ever heard! I spent well over $300 at this Walmart just in the past week I was planning on shopping again tonight but now I'm taking my business elsewhere Whoever thought of that policy should be fired<//review>

Prices are not that low, like in the Inland empire, ( I will make my purchases over there, when I go there once or twice a week )

I only have them a 2 stars because there employees are super nice.

Worst of all is the selection of water. it is pathetic,  they only have a small shelf for popular brands, and a huge self for there brand "Great Value" ...obviously nobody wants them because there rack was full....they must think we are like cattle  that eventually we will take them, if is nothing else is there. guess what greedy b.....ds there other stores.<//Review>

Unfortunately Walmart gets a bad rap as it is people come here with hardly any clothes on. If you need help finding something the staff never knows where it is. One time we need to get razors and they were locked up and we will almost waited an hour for an employee to come open the door for us. Unfortunately people trash the place there's cups and trash on the shelves with products.< /Text>

<text>Everytime I go to this Walmart it's like I just missed the riot.. the shelves are torn up, products everywhere. The things you need are gone or under lock and key. It's as ghetto as it gets.. plenty of clerks at the door to make sure you don't steal anything but, no one there for service,stock the shelves, or clean.<//text></record></dataset><record>

This Walmart is massive! You can find anything you need at this store. The grocery section is well stocked with a great selection of food items.< /Review>

< Review>
Place is dirty, unorganized, the food in the hot "deli" is utterly disgusting, I don't understand how the health department allows them to sell, the cashiers barely speak English and it's hard to communicate with them (I don't mind communicating in Spanish at all, but the ones that don't speak either is hard) other cashiers are just plain clueless about their job, I feel bad for them because they are really old and I'm sure they need the job but they can't work a register and they seem confused and overwhelmed with the tasks. The younger workers in the garden department are just plain clueless, I think they are just there to make sure people don't steal through the door.< /Review>

<review>Very unhappy that there only open until 12pm and not 24hrs. I always did my shopping at night because I work and I liked that there wasnt alot of people with long lines at night. Now there's no 24 hr store around. They always had people there so there decision not to be open 24 hours is going to cost the money definitely not caring about the customers the employees there aren't that great anyways but I still went because it to Walmart and they were open 24 hours definitely going to find somewhere else to go for now on I don't go there during the day so I'll be going to a grocery store instead of Walmart that's their choice they're bad they missed out on<//review><Resp>None</Resp></record></dataset><record>

<text>I hate having to search for prices on things.  Overhead music alternates from Spanish to English.  If I were to shop at a Cardenas, I would expect to hear Spanish music.  This store is in the United States, which to everyone who comes from a foreign country knows that English is the language.  Also, would like to have someone understand me when I am looking for something...instead, they have to go get a person that is bilingual to assist me.  Associates in deli will not help you unless you get their attention...even if you make eye contact.  Nothing will be done, because that is how Walmart is run these days.  Sam Walton is probably rolling over in his grave with the service that this store provides</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

very bad customer service.I bought a money order to pay for rent and i ended by not using it.I called monegram to ask what we can do and they said you could cash it if your name on the purchaser line.Good enough, right?well i went to walmart where i bought it and she said she needs the slip that the purchaser keep with him.I went home brought it to her then she said the original receipt I told her I don't have it and you should have the transaction recorded in your system since i purchased it 3 days ago.
Then she start arguing about her policy and being rude.I ask for the store manager and they made me wait an hour like he is a big deal.Store manager said this is their policy and i told him you should care about your customer not your policy and since moneygram said they should take care of it since they cash checks.Don't waist your time and don't do money service with them because you will be wasting your time and your money.Their employee under trained and rude and just care about policy not customers.< /Text>

Got asked to leave the area by Security/Management.  All I was doing was collecting plastic bottles, and aluminum cans. I go home every night to feed my two gay sons, with the money I earn from collecting. Now every night my two boys are telling me everyday and every night "Daddy I'm Hungry". I live in a cardboard box with my two boys, in an abandoned area, and my two boys are starving because of Wal-Mart and their trash hoarding policy. Nobody cares for the LGBTQ dirt poor and Homeless, we are not a dissease, so stop treating us like we are not human.< /text>

Huge store, Managers are incompetent of local law. employees are often lazy and knowledgeable. Some employees do not speak English. This stores phone operators are completely ignorant.
I have had many dealing with this store because they are the only one in the area and every time I have had a issue with a item I have bought there I have not been dealt with fairly.
Try at your own risk.</text>

Am I in zombieland? Most of the customer service reps make me feel that way.
If you are lucky enough to find a rep that speaks english, they still do not know where most items are or care enough to help you find it.
The reps that do not speak English...you can still tell they don't care by the look on their face.<//review>

huge store. check out lines incredibly long and slow moving any time of day. employees attitude toward customers is indicative of their working conditions. Just saying...
grocery prices are great... rarely worth the unpleasant experience.
duh, its walmart.<//Text>

Desloge Super Center has gotten very worse Farmington is your best they are so unorganized and they move things around way too much. And 90% of the time you have to look for someone to help you and all the good things that you used to buy are no longer there too bad they don't have a Kmart in this time to replace it I've been going to Crystal City just to go to Kmart and other stores instead of Walmart cuz I don't like Walmart's attitude toward their workers are low on their customers they don't care about their customers and Desloge horrible management< /review>

You can find almost whatever you need from: tires, tools, outdoor equipment ( camping, fishing, hunting outdoor clothing, etc), cleaning products, food for pets, home decor, medicine and so much more. Just don't expect to not find things out of place once in a while.< /Review>

But overall I think the business model is less appealing to the shopper than Amazon so my activity as a purchaser has shifted away from Walmart almost 90℅ despite the covenant closeness in proximity this company should consider implementing revionion of policy committed to coustmer loyalty and satisfaction to maintain sastainabillity.<//text>< pics>

Ordered HP printer ink online, but received some kind of cumin powder instead.  Had to take a bus to Wal-Mart to straighten out the mess.  Not sure if I would order anything again from Wal-Mart.< /text>

I ENJOY ALL WALMARTS, BUT I AM WAITING FOR THE NEW MANAGEMENT TO RECEIVE THE ELECTRIC CARTS THAT WERE RECENTLY ORDERED. (FOR HANDICAPPED PEOPLE OR PEOPLE WITH MOBILITY ISSUES)... AS THERE HAS BEEN AN ONGOING PROBLEM WITH SUPPLYING MORE THAN 2 OR 3 CARTS FOR AT LEAST 2 YEARS... I AND OTHER WALMART SHOPPERS HAVE ALWAYS HAD TO WAIT MORE THAN 1 HOUR FOR A CART TO BE AVAILABLE... THIS IS THE ONLY WALMART FROM LOS ANGELES TO COACHELLA VALLEY I HAVE EVER EXPERIENCED THIS PROBLEM WITH...THE NEW ASST. MGR TOLD ME AND 3 OTHER CUSTOMERS THAT BY MID FEBRUARY THE WALMART (LOCATED AT 5601 E. RAMON RD. PALM SPRINGS) SHOULD  RECEIVE MORE THAN 5 ELECTRIC CARTS!!!MOST OTHER LOCATIONS HAVE BETWEEN 5 & 10 AT ALL TIMES...JUST WAITING TO SEE!!! 😀👍 SINCERELY MS. DANA< /text>

I thought Walmart priced match but apparently they don't brought in a valid coupon from Albertsons and they would not accept the coupon for the product needless to say I didn't buy it there and went to Albertsons.</text>

<text>Aggressively rude five year employee standing by the exit. She was so too busy socializing that she almost missed us walking out. She rushed over once she noticed us saying, "Excuse me sir! May I see a receipt!" The alarm did not go off as we walked out, and yet it seemed as if she was treating us as thieves! Haven't been to a Wal-Mart that stops people going out. Maybe Sam's Club or Costco, but not Wal-Mart. Even if it's the policy here, she should not have been so aggressive or rude, and should be paying attention as people go out.</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><Gmap_id>0x80db1c9258a1abdf:0xe9dda3cf6db5da70</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
A Message to Walmart CEO McMillon... After seeing the announcement today "denouncing President Trump" I will no longer be shopping at Walmart. Let me ask - when Black Lives Matter rioted and ambushed cops, did you denounce then President Obama? No, you started selling shirts for BLM. When dead/dying people were found in the back of a trailer on Walmart property, did you denounce Illegal Alien Trafficking? No. Do you denounce ANTIFA for spitting on people and throwing urine on them? No. Our president denounced the HATE from BOTH sides... and that's where the hate comes from... ALL sides. All those hell bent on destroying Trump... best remember that there are 63 Million... yes, that is MILLION of us who voted for and support OUR PRESIDENT!!! You insult one of us, you insult ALL of us!!! Guess when Walmart's Stocks tank you'll "get" that We The People control the direction of our Country NOT some pathetic, weak CEO who doesn't have a pair and sits behind a desk.< /Review>

Seriously, what the hell is with the goddamned beeping?  No matter what Wal-Mart I go to there is an incessant beeping coming from the overhead.  This can't be normal.  If the alarm system is malfunctioning, FIX IT!!!  If your goal is to drive people from your stores as fast as possible, then MISSION ACCOMPLISHED.  If I had to work here the place would be strewn with dead bodies by the end of day one.< /review>

I gave the Wal-Mart by my house 4 stars because of its 24/7 overwhelmingly oppressive vibe. This Wal-Mart in Palm Springs is not bad at all, actually it's surprisingly nice, probably because there are rarely very many people inside. It's super clean, the staff is helpful, and although it's not the biggest Wal-Mart I've seen it has everything I need.</review>

Palm Springs doesn't realize how big their WalMart is until they go to somewhere like LA or San Diego and all their WalMarts have close to 1/3 of what the PS one has. I've lived other places and the Palm Desert/Palm Springs ones are still the biggest I've been to and have the most stuff, hard to find a Super WalMart in other parts of SoCal.< /Text>< user>

<Text>Worst in the country. Ive never had people act so rude to me in a store like them. Id rather drive 7 miles to palm desert then ever go back there. If it was only the first time going there i wouldn't post this, but its been every time ive gone in the past three months. I hope that upper management dose something cause its stupid going there.<//Text>< response>

Why the hell do they say they close at 12 when it's a lie. I went there a few mins before they closed and I even pointed out that it wasn't 12 yet and three of the workers just stood there looking at me and laughing, Signaling me that they were closed and laughing at the same time. I would put a negative 5 if that was possible but unfortunately I had to choose a 1 just because I needed to post this. They don't  deserve any stars.</text>

<review>This is Adriber I will always provide the best and honest reviews. Decide to stop by Walmart to get my tire repair. Had to wait like 15 minutes to get help. After I got help had to wait over an hour to replace two (2) tires. Horrible wait time. I honestly believe Walmart has soo much potential. But they keep hitting a Plato with their customers service and empty items on stock. Maybe there employees from management to associate need to be train on seeing things from the customer's point of view. And put them self more at the customer shoe's. That would make the customer shopping experience and the employees work much better. Look for ways they can go above and beyond for a customer. On the other hand, I really like how the company has honestly change the products they sell to more made in the USA products. I notice a lot of Walmart items no longer say made in China. Compare to their competitors that mostly sell made in China products. I also, like how Walmart has gone to great lengths to reduce their carbon footprint. By making their stores very energy efficient some Walmarts even have solar parking. The fact that they price match makes them a one stop shop. Again I honestly think this company has a lot of potential but they will never get there if they can't over come the bad customer experience. Such as wait time,  service help or empty shelves. Once they do over come it, only then will it be a true power house. As always I'm the firm believer of quality over quantity. This is my review and remember always look for adriber for the best and honest review.<//review>< name>

The employees at the customer help desk were very rude and disrespectful and I will not return until that store wakes up and gets rid of these nasty I'll mannered unworthy of a job let alone in the customer service area.....I mean there were s couple of friendly faces but, the big ole mean nasty gals took the centre stage and let me tell you that the only Oscar that would or should be given to would to be to myself for being able to keep my cool ans not to go off on these very rude and disrespectful condescending nasty bitter trolls<//review>

The problem with Wal-Mart is that the electronics area closes instead of the entire store. Last time they let us in, but now they won't! I wanted to get a pair of headphones but seriously. I don't know why do they  put the Orange gates in the electronics.< /text>

<rate>2< /rate><Review>I don't normally shop at Walmart but it was late and I was in the area. They had everything I was looking for but only had one cashier and there were a lot of shoppers. I am not a fan of self checking as I see it as working for free. I go to the one cashier's lane and she says there are no bags, not just in her line but in the store period. How does Walmart run out of bags?< /Review>< pictures>

<Text>Came here to buy a new phone, just before Christmas. Went to the mobile phone Center in the front off the store. Was told that they didn't have the model i wanted in that location. You need to go to electronics in the back of the. store. Ok no problem. Ok a little problem. They don't have any phones of that model on the shelf. The website said they had two in stock, could you check in back? Ok one moment sir. After10 minutes i asked another employee. Ok sir just one minute. After10 minutes nothing. So i am asking another employee, and the first one comes around the corner, he never left was just working over by the videos. When he finally recognizes me he asks the last employee could he look out up for me. He has been there this whole time....30 minutes could have looked it up at any time. Yeah we got 2 there in the mobile phone center in the front of the store, you just gotta take this pictuure of a phone up there.....meanwhile when i arrive in the mobile phone center , with a picture of the phone i want ...no problem sir we have 2 pulls one out which i buy, guess i should have brought a picture with me. Where do you keep the cases and screen protectors for this phone? Oh no sir we dont carry those. Of course not. Silly me. Do you sell model x phones? No sir. But you have cases for them here...... Nevermind. But the prices are good.< /Text>< Pics>

Apparently their tire center doesn't like to answer phone calls.
I'll be going somewhere else. You lose $$$ now Wal-Mart. Rude guy at the Customer Service Counter, said my receipt wasn't valid becuase it was torn?!? Had to get manager to explain it to dumbface... name starts with 'A' - as in A-hole...</Text>

Very poor customer service both over the phone and in person.  Called for three hours straight with no answer. When traveled all the way to the store and both employees and the managers there act like they are un aware of what products they sale or when they get more product in. The ppl there seem like they dont know whats going on most of the time or like they dont understand english...let alone speak it.  And to top it off i am disabled and they have 10 mobility scooters in the entire store and only about four of them actually work.  Very disappointed.<//Text>

I love the Walmart prices,  but do not like the wait to pay and get out,  not enough cashiers and many staff appear to be in a bad mood,  once in a while you get a friendly face offering to help with a smile...< /Text>

< review>
The guy in the Auto dept is kinda  rude. After I waited awhile in line he told me they were closed. It was only about 7 minutes to 6 and I told him I only wanted a price on tires.  He kinda helped me anyway haphazardly but was kinda rude about it and acted like he didn't want to help me....I guess he wasn't late for dinner or something... Guess I'll go get my tires elsewhere< /review>

Worse Walmart I've ever been too so hard. The only store that doesn't let you return other Walmart purchased items with receipt.
Won't be coming this location anymore.<//Review>

Return policy -Expect a long line for any type of return. Expect to show your picture ID even if you're making an exchange who knows why but Expect it We avoid shopping at Walmart during Christmas and holidays because of the long lines for returns exchanges and the complicated exchange process< /review>

This Walmart is the worst Walmart I've ever been at they do not keep the shelves stocked they do not have adequate carts in the back by the garden section I will never go back to the Walmart in Palm Springs on Ramon and their management is not very nice either when you make a complaint they just brush you off or not try to solve the problem< /Review>

Went into the store to by bikes and had to hunt down a staff member.  The person was disagreeable and resented being troubled by a customer.  He went into the back to find the person responsible for bikes...but came out alone saying he would help us.  He knew NOTHING about the bikes and was no help at all...we left without a bike and we had come TO BUY!  Before leaving I asked another clerk to tell me were I could by string. She and one other colleague did not understand enough English to answer my question!!! What are these unhelpful non english speaking people doing working in customer service??? It is outrageous.</review>

I went this afternoon to get some fabric material and I asked the lady who was attending that area for some help and she was so rude , the a couple questions a did a got replay on the same way ( rude) I don’t know because her age (like 60s) and she doesn’t have patience or because she is racist but is so sad seeing the rest of the crew doing great job and employee like this lady decreasing their customer service.< /review>

I was totally disrespected by your sales associate. he shouldn't be behind the counter for he had "zero" knowledge of the electronics department. I went in to buy a Samsung Phone and left empty handed because of the attitude and lack of service I received.< /text>

Walmart had almost everything that was on our shopping lists, and the staff were very helpful when queried on the location of items.

The only minus is there were no handicapped electric carts for shopping.</text>

The cart pusher terron was more than rude to my mother and when I tried to file a complaint the acting manager did nothing but ask us to call a 1800 number so don't expect anything but poor service and terrible experience</Text>

Customer service is horrible and online says they are open 24/7 I get there and an employee says, as we are getting to the door, that they close at 12 now everynight and it's been that way for a month. Like really change your hours online then!</text>

What a dump. They NEVER have enough cashiers, yet dozens of employees walking the store in circles "looking busy". Don't use this store unless you need 1 item that you can self check-out.<//Text>

<text>Incredibly poorly trained management makes this store a complete joke for a retail facility. Poorly trained management produces poorly trained employees, and that's the best you can say about this store. WalMart altogether in Coachella Valley area has extremely poor service compared to the Midwest, likely showing the problem is systemic and from well paid executives that simply do not care about customer satisfaction, just customer spending. Clearly, WalMart accepts this culture here.< /text>< time>

<Text>(Translated by Google) Very neat Walmart.

Store is well-arranged. This Walmart can also be collected online.

Staff are friendly, also the aisles with products are kept very neatly by the staff that walks around here.

(Original)
Zeer nette Walmart.

Winkel is overzichtelijk. Bij deze Walmart kan er ook online afgehaald worden.

Personeel is vriendelijk, ook worden de gangpaden met producten zeer netjes bijgehouden door het personeel wat hier rondloopt.<//Text>< Pics>

<pics>None< /pics><Text>(Translated by Google) The experience that happened yesterday with a walmart employee was very unpleasant. I asked about the difference between one product and another and the answer was WE DON'T HAVE TIME TO BE PLEASING IT. That is not the way to respond to a customer. If we as a customer are not going to Walmart to buy Senora, you know that you would be unemployed ...............

(Original)
Fue muy desagradable la experiencia que pase ayer con una empleada de walmart pregunte por la diferencia de un producto hacia otro producto y la respuesta fue NO TENEMOS TIEMPO PARA ESTAR LE LLENDO. Esa no es la forma de responderle a un cliente. Si nosotros como cliente no vamos a walmart a comprar Senora usted se que daria sin empleo...............< /Text>< Response>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) There was a lot of them for sale,
Nice and cheap and good quality.
You have everything you need from clothes to food to game consoles.
Then you think why you don't give 5 stars.
I do not give this 5 stars because it was very busy and all people bought in for weeks so it took a long time before it was your turn.
That's why these 4 stars

(Original)
Er was ernorm veel te koop,
Lekker goedkoop en goede kwaliteit.
Je hebt er alles wat je nodig hebt van kleren tot eten tot gameconsoles.
Dan denk je waarom geef je geen 5 sterren.
Ik geef deze 5 sterren niet omdat het erg druk was en alle mensen kochten in voor wel weken dus het duurde lang voordat je aan de beurt was.
Daarom deze 4 sterren< /Review>
