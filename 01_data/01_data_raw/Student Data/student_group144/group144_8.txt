I’ve been to so many different stores to find a gift for a friend and by far this place was the place to find it. I don’t know how I did not know about this place before. I bought her a shirt and a cute pant. Life saver< /Text>

Jeez i was just scrolling through all of the bad reviews😬The Fashion Nova in Burbank was cool they had good quality clothes and the customer service was nice. As for the online store, I believe I've ordered from them 3 times now and every delivery would actually arrive EARLIER than the delivery date. The only sort of bad thing I could say is that I ordered my graduation dress and its supposed to be "neck-high" and it was, but the chest area was kind of puffy and loose. So I dont know what was up with that. But clothing wise, like joggers, jeans,  shirts, and all that have been really good quality. 👍🏽💯</Review>

I came here looking for a dress for a holiday party for my job and Tay Brooks helped me. She was amazing, she knew what kinda dress so that it was okay for work but cute looking at the same time. She was also so nice. I used to work at Macys and our customer service was never as good as her’s.100% would come back and recommend.</Review>

The whole enterprise is a joke i ordered 4 pieces one arrived therefor i mailed the support directly. They told me that they gonna send the missing clothes again. After another week again no delivery. When I reported the matter they told me that I should have informed them earlier what I did. I even got letters proving that I informed in the day the delivery arrived but they don't accept it.</text>

We were in the store for a while being indecisive, but felt as though we were being watched. When we asked questions at the register they were very rude and vague. My friend left her phone in the store and no one put it in a safe spot when we came back, it was on top of the register right in front of the employees face.

WHERE IS MY  GIFTCARD FOR ORDER# 33950843 WHICH WAS DELIVERED ON JUNE 21,2019 AT 11:46AM? I SENT THEM THE TRACKING NUMBER, AND IT CLEARLY SHOW THAT IT WAS MAILED AND DELIVERED! THEY EMAILED ME TELLING ME I NEED TO SEND A COPY OF THE RECEIPT, BECAUSE THEY HAVE LOST MY PACKAGE! I DIDN'T KEEP THE RECEIPT, BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN  ALMOST 2 WEEKS AGO. EVERYTIME I ORDER I MAKE SURE I KEEP THE TRACKING NUMBER! I HAVE 11 ITEMS THAT I PAID TO HAVE RETURNED TO THEM, AND THEY ARE TELLING ME IF I CAN NOT PROVIDE A COPY OF THE RECEIPT THEY WANT SEND ME MY GIFTCARD? I ORDER FROM THEM ALL OF THE TIME, AND MY ORDER NUMBER MATCH UP TO MY EMAIL, AND IT SHOW IT WAS SHIPPED FROM ATLANTA AND DELIVERED TO CALIFORNIA! SO IT IS COMMON SENSE I SHIPPED THE ITEMS BACK! I WANT MY GIFTCARD FOR MY 11 ITEMS, BECAUSE THEY HAVE NEVER ASKED FOR A COPY OF MY RECEIPT. ALL THEY ASK FOR IS A TRACKING NUMBER, AND THEY HAVE IT! I HATE THIS COMPANY, BECAUSE THEY ARE ALWAYS TRYING TO GET OVER ON CUSTOMERS TO MAKE THEM PAY MORE MONEY! THEY ARE TRYING THEIR BEST NOT TO SEND ME MY GIFTCARD PLAYING GAMES! I PAID FOR POSTAGE, AND HAVE A GIFTCARD DUE TO ME FOR OVER 200.00! I WANT MY GIFTCARD ASAP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THIS DON'T MAKE ANY SENSE, AND DUE TO THEM BEING NEGLIGENT LOOSING MY PACKAGE NOT KNOWING WHERE IT IS THEY WANT ME TO SHOW PROOF WHEN I ALREADY DID VIA EMAIL A MILLION TIMES!!!!!!!!<//Text>

Customer service was not great. The store representatives seem to have attitude and were not friendly. Definitely won’t be going in there again. The clothes are not that great quality for the employees to be uptight to customers.</text>

No store credit nor replacement pair of jeans. There is no one to call or talk to over the phone. They told her it was between her (my fìance) and usps. However, THEY (fashion nova) chose to ship usps. Usps is THEIR carrier of choice. Customer satisfaction should come first. Online businesses should be prepared to replace merchandise that is lost in transit and sort the rest out with the carrier. Bottom line...<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

So embarrassed and annoyed beyond anything.
I came to this store waited in line for 15 minutes while all the girls try to act busy while they walked around talking about their plans for the weekend and whatnot. Finally got to the register to return some items and the lady out loud and bluntly states “WE DONT CARRY PLUS SIZE IN OUR STORE”  it was humiliating and first of all I did not even ask if they did all I wanted was a return and she embarrassed me in front of the employees and the line of people behind me. And the girls did not greet me or help me at all they just looked at me and continued “organizing” and pushing the clothes so violently it irritated my ears scraping the metal. Also the girls dress so unprofessional I get wearing Fashion Nova clothes is promoting their store but there is a line behind being professional and not wearing small crop tops with their chest hanging out. I will never be coming to this store ever again and will recommend everyone to stay away from this place.< /Review>

My wife was shopping here, she’s a frequent shopper but on this day the service was horrible, the Mexican manager lady with the dark hair was as rude as they come, she directed ppl to follow us around the store and wouldn’t greet us or speak when we made a purchase, she needs to focus on not being racist and treating black customers with the same courtesy as the other shoppers,<//Text>

<text>(Translated by Google) I make orders every so often to this store from Spain and always everything is perfect, they have everything and it is a spectacular store! I love the clothes they sell, if I put a stick it is that the pictures are different colors (and this goes for jeans) but otherwise a 10❤️

(Translated by Google) Place an order from Spain to the FASHION NOVA store. I have not received it, 3 weeks have passed, they do not respond by phone, emails or social networks. Non-existent customer service, they have sent me the wrong shipping number. I have lost my money and received nothing. LOAN, LOUD, LOAN.

Huge shout out to Mike and Rim Pros staff for their excellent work and customer service. I am a 3-peat customer with two curb rash repairs on a black wheel that were brought back to 95-98%. Recently powder coated a set of M3 wheels that came out absolutely perfect. Mike and his team has exceptional customer service, which is very hard to find in the car industry. Definitely recommend Rim Pros to anyone needing repair work.< /text>

Knowledgeable respectful professional compassionate and hardworking team.
Starting with the front desk, the madam was so knowledgeable about the operation and was able to answer all my questions. I hate asking questions and having to wait for every answer 10 min because the front desk person has to consult with the wheel guys ( this was my experience everywhere except Rim Pros) I had a specific problem on my BMW z3 with vibration while driving where I had several wheels that were out of round so needed diagnosis and repair. I got an appointment and showed up early in the morning and was told to wait while the wheels are being inspected and repaired. Nick and his staff noticed me waiting outside and they couldn’t have been any nicer to me. Although they were very honest with me saying that the wait could be 3+ hours, any chance nick had he brought me in the shop and showed me the inspection process and the defect in my wheels. They often came out to give me updates and for small talk.
Finally, the repair was very notable, most of my vibration while I drive was gone!!

Quality work; best prices and compassionate and caring staff!

Other businesses should learn a thing or two from you guys!

<Text>Had been experiencing a small leak in a new tire. Suspected a cracked/damaged rim. Sure enough. It was diagnosed and fixed within 2 hours. $175 versus the cost of a new rim is a win.

Tip: Pay in cash get a 10% discount.< /Text>< Pictures>

Took my wheels here to get a nice fresh new powder coat and they did an excellent job! They also fixed some curb rash as well and the rims look brand new! Nick and his team were super easy to work with and prompt with communication through texting. Great customer service and very fair pricing. Would highly recommend. Thanks!< /text>

<review>I curb damaged a rim on my 2018 Honda Fit. It ground into the metal and trashed the black finish. I found Rim Pros and brought the rim down for repair. Not only was the repair affordable, but they were quick and did an absolutely beautiful job. The rim is all pretty and new again. I highly recommend Andrea and her crew. Thank you rim Pros, great job!</review>< pictures>

The noise was horrendous! Fortunately the undercarriage was untouched but found a pretty significant dent in my rim.
The word on the street was that Rim Pro's were the ones to see! Texted them after hours with my issue and travel & time constraints. First thing the next day got a text with not only an available appointment that day but, that they could get me in and out in 2 hours!
Was greeted by Andrea and her professionalism and welcoming demeanor was exemplary!
The rim tech (forgot to ask his name) got right on it and after inspection came in to tell me the damage was significant but that he could get it fixed. 1 1/2 hours later he came in and said the repair went great and the wheel was as good as new.
Drove away with a big smile on my face and it was like it never happened. The wheel looks fantastic!
I highly recommend Rim Pro's! Their professionalism, attitude and level of service are second to none!
Thank you Rim Pro's!!< /Text><pics>None<//pics><response>None< /response>< gmap_id>

Was told about this place by a friend at American tires. Had corrosion on the inside of one of my chrome rims. Thought I might need to have the rim rechromed.  But was lucky said they could fix it without the chrome because it was on the inside of the rim. They removed all the corrosion ,primed and sealed it. Took about an hour and a half. Because of the corrosion my tire wasn't sealing and I was leaking air.  All their work is guaranteed. Will let you know how it works. So far am very pleased . The staff was very nice and had a great waiting area.  Which she told me was completely sanitized every morning. I saved probably over $250/300 by going there.  Great place highly recommend it to anyone .</text>

Fixed same day in about 45 minutes to an hour, after being quoted a 2-hour job. Before this my one tire on that wheel was losing about 25 psi and i would have to reinflate every hour of driving, with a constant TPMS warning on my dash. After a couple of hours' driving it has been clear so far. Saved me a costly wheel replacement and potentially not being able to drive anywhere while waiting for delivery and installation at a tire shop. Thank you!< /text>< response>

I have a dent in one of my aluminum super snake rims. These rims are rare and no longer in production. Went to Rim Pros in Sacramento today to have it looked at by Nick, the owner. Unfortunately due to the type of finish and where the dent is located, it isn’t possible to fix the dent without ruining the finish and possibly having the rim crack during the repair process. But let me just say that Nick and his staff (receptionist, son & father) were extremely friendly, knowledgeable and honest. Even tho the rim couldn’t be repaired, the dent was causing a slow leak. Nick offered to take care of that for me and did so in a very timely manner. He did an outstanding job. Would definitely highly recommend Rim Pros to anyone looking to have their rims repaired!!<//Review>

Rim Pros did a fantastic job restoring a rim on my Porsche 911 991. The wheel hit a curb and they repaired it in less than two hours. Excellent quality and service and Mike and Nick are super. It looks like new!

Felt really comfortable the first time meeting them.I had a weirdly bent wheel, not noticeable to the eye but was noticeable on the balance machine at speed. Unfortunately it couldn't be fixed.

<review>Such a great experience, and very great work on my new car's rim repair. I was able to speak directly with the shop's owner, Nick, before and after the work was completed. He provided answers to all of my questions; and I was incredibly satisfied with the professionalism and knowledge that the owner and his team had. With the rim repair work completed, one would never be able to tell that damage existed before the work was done. Thank you Rim Pros!<//review>< pictures>

This place did a great job repairing my wheel. The owner said that wheel will be a challenge to color match since it was a gunmetal color and that it might not come out perfect but it'll be close. After receiving my wheel back, I couldn't find where the original curb rash was and tried looking for any imperfection but couldn't find any. Will definitely do business with again.</text>

<rating>5<//rating><Review>Very hidden but definitely worth your time if you need to get a wheel unbent and balanced! I'm a college student so as such I'm spread pretty thin when it comes to funds. The cost for the straightening and balancing of the wheel came out to a very reasonable price! Nick is a very straight forward and honest guy that won't cut corners. Very caring for his customers as well, if there was a bigger rating than 5 stars I would give it to Nick anytime.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

<text>Fantastic!!! Rim Pros was recommended to me by America's Tire to repair my damaged wheels. They told me they have never had any complaints from customers who they recommend use them. With this I had set some high expectations going into my appointment. Nick and the team were super friendly, got the job done in about half the time quoted. And it totally blew me away - over the topic quality!!! Brand new wheels again! Huge fan!<//text><pics>None< /pics>< Rating>

Rim Pros did an excellent job on my 2008 Mustang GT FOOSE rims. The rims were 10 years old and had seen better days. They look as good as they did 10 years ago. Highly recommend Rim Pros if you are looking to refurbish you rims.<//review>

First an foremost,  I have thrashed my wheels and didn't think I  can ever get them repaired... never checked, never bothered.. but my wheels bothered me. I had to do something about it.  Anyways coming forward to the future after 1 year with me grinding away,  I knew I had to find a good place to get them repaired. There were only 4 locations that looked promising.   I picked Rim Pros due to ...of course the 5 ☆☆☆☆☆ rating.  I thought.. maybe they will get them half as they used to look.. you know  BRAND NEW!. Anywho.. Carol had told me that it could take half a day.. but after 4 hours I couldn't believe my eyes.. they look like I just bought them they got skills!,..no remnants of the scars, scuffs, thrashing...  just UNBELIEVABLE!!! work that they have done. Carol is amazing and was very helpful and knowledgeable a true professional!. Nick and his team worked fast and took there time to make sure they turned out the best product they only know how. Thank you very much.. you have a customer for life and will be telling my friends and family where they can get their work done.</text>

I've been using Rim Pros for a better part of 10 years and have always gotten excellent customer service and great pricing from Nick. I've probably had 4 to 6 cars that needed Wheels repaired and I always trust Nick to take care of them. You're in great hands with Nick and trust that the work be done and done right.</Review>

The weather was perfect, even if a bit chilly during the Thanksgiving holiday.  The monks received me with such joy and grace!  I will never forget it.  The food was a little scanty
🐽, I am a big eater, but quite good nevertheless.  But don't let me deceive you, it was not all flowers and rainbows.  The chapel, with breathtaking views over the Pacific, is not always silent during Mass.  I noticed, and my sensitive ears were quick to detect, loud child noises throughout the prayer.  I am quite shocked, as were some of the good monks, to see how many unruly children were present!! This is a MONASTERY people!!! The monks and guests probably want a QUIET time of prayer without being bothered by your unruly and naughty children.
Apart from that very disquieting affair, my time was very affable.  Thank you.<//review>< Pictures>

10 of my Quilting friends went for a Retreat for 3 1/2 days at the Abbey.  We used the large conference room and it was very comfortable for all. The only complaint we had is we felt rushed at the meals since part of our retreat is to sit after a meal and discuss whatever.  The hospitality of all the staff, monks, Brothers and Fathers was outstanding.  They all seemed very interested in our sewing projects.<//text>

A beautiful and perfect place for prayer, reflection, meditation, and contemplation. Everytime I go, I leave feeling more peaceful and more happy. The church is beautiful inside, especially the chapel. The prayer trails are amazing. Last time I walked the prayer trail containing the "Way of the Cross". I prayed all the stations with my friend, and the setting and atmosphere allowed us to really meditate on the stations of the cross. The views are spectacular. The prayer trails serve as a perfect place to enjoy, take in, and appreciate wilderness. The gift shop has an impressive collection of books, art, gifts, accessories, etc. The library is also of a good size and has many books to utilize for prayer and study. The grounds also serves as a center for retreats and spiritual activities and events, so if you're considering having some type of activity or event, I highly suggest the Prince of Peace abbey!<//Review>

Excellent place for retreat. Praying with the monks is refreshing to soul and body. I encountered the peace of Christ in many ways here.  Recommended.</review>

I spent a weekend retreat at the abbey this March, 2013. It has been some time since I went to a retreat at any Catholic facility, probably 50 years. The monks were very approachable, helpful, and had the face of someone in close contact with their savior. There is a great opportunity to join in worship and prayer with them in their church. They took care that I was able to find my place and sing the Psalms with them each day. Their life is dedicated to knowing their savior and it reflects in their souls. Such a welcome relief from this world. The rooms are quiet and very clean. The food is served well and on time. You can walk on the top of their mesa in quietness and reflection looking at the California coastal chaparral. This gave me a chance to retreat with my savior and I enjoyed it.<//text>

<text>The food was great. Wish they would have given me everything that I paid for:( ordered at 4:58 today 10/5/20 Was told 25 mins for my pick up. Got there 5:30 and was told 5 mins more. 5:40 I got my food. Was told over the phone $17+ when I got there it was $19.90. Asked for the receipt and she couldn't find it and she looked through the trash can for it. I get home and my rice is missing. Called and all she said "my bad" and if I wanted to go back and grab it lol!😖<//text>< pictures>

Been here a few times now. Most of the food is delicious but I personally find that the taste and even the kind of meat ( tender or size) is inconsistent. Minus one star for that. The gentleman who is usually in there is great and you feel like going back but sometimes there is a younger lady in there and she is RUDE. Made me feel like she was doing me a favor by giving me the food I PAID for. Even took the order really rudely. Haven't been back for a minute now!</review>

<review>We stopped in for our weekly dinner out and this was a good choice. It was suggested while at work this week and what a great suggestion.

The service was good and the food was excellent.

We ordered: Chicken Tikka (dry, not wet), Sag Paneer (medium spicy), and Chana Masala (spicy).

The Chicken tikka was cooked perfectly and it was tender and served still sizzling; SOO good.

The Sag Paneer was super flavorful.

The Chana Masala was out of this world and not too spicy.

Everything was cooked fresh and it showed. We left full, not overly full, and very satisfied. Oh yeah we even got some Barfi for the house; Very fresh.

If you like Indian food give this place a shot you should be pleased.

I have something confusing to report.
Ordered Chicken Vindaloo today and it was made with some Chicken AND some Potato's? Like 3 pieces of chicken and 5 pieces of potato. Hrmm.< /review>< user>

My wife and I were greeted in an unfriendly manner... But who cares how we were treated... The food was excellent and that is what matters.. The serve was a good size... Love spicy level of food while my wife enjoyed medium level of spiciness... The front desk lady forgot to pack fork, spoon and napkins.
The food is great... The service m not really sure.... I would definitely recommend to try the Vindaloo Chicken...<//text>

I placed an order over the phone and was told it would be ready in 25 minutes, got there, and had to wait another 25 minutes. The girl in the front was extremely rude, she was on her phone and told me I was *too* early to get the food even though I arrived exactly when she told me. She was gossiping in Punjabi about customers. They made fun of someone who placed an order over the phone, which was really disrespectful. The workers in the back were not wearing a mask and you could hear them talking to one another while making food. The girl in the front just sat on her phone and made no attempt to make sure I got my food on time. The rice they gave me was extremely undercooked, to the point where you could break a tooth. I’ve never had an experience like this but next time Livingston or Ceres would be worth the drive. I’d recommended hiring a new person in the front.< /Text>

The short girl with the shorter length hair working the counter seemed more distracted with her phone & gossiping with her coworker then to greet us when we walked in to order. Her tone of voice & mannerisms came across very rude & arrogant. Punjab express owner needs to hire better employees or train the current ones on professionalism.<//Review>< pics>

<Review>Please replace the short girl at the front counter. Made my family feel unwelcome & talked rudely. I didn't not even bother to place the rest of the order We walked out and went to an Indian restraunt in ceres. Hope the owner reads this. You are losing customers based on all the other negative reviews. I also noticed the positive reviews with generic names posting the same exact thing. They have be fake accounts to keep their ratings high.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

<Rating>1< /Rating><review>I ordered 2 chicken ticca tandoori style I had Requested that the chef spice it up a bit with some tomato spice or ketchup. I instructed the girl who took my order of the chef can make it spicy by putting a little tomato base to the onion and bell peppers so the meat is not 2 dry and we can have a little kick of flavor. I have had it made at other restaurant all around the us millions of times so I requested if they can make it this way. The girl on the phone sad sure and told my my order will be ready in 30 min. My brother picks up the order when he brought it home. When I was about to serve it to my guest I saw they did not add any spice to it the ch was extra dry. I called and the female was really rouse and told me they don’t make it that way and I asked her why didn’t she just say that or checked with the chef when i was placing the order. I wouldn’t have ordered it. She starts to argue and when I asked to speak to the owner she told me to come to the restaurant. And I explained to her in Punjabi dnd English that I have guest over I need to talk to him on the phone. Then she told me he’s not at the restaurant. She clearly lied to me and then continued to argue with me on the phone. Keep in mind I didn’t ask for a refund even once. I just felt really disappointed and hurt. I can’t believe how this female treated me A paying customer who just wanted to complaint to the owner or manager and all I wanted was them to know they made a mistake so they don’t do this to anyone else. My night was round we ended up not even eating the chicken ticca. I grow up in the restaurant field and know how to  lol everything my self I just wanted to be lazy and order out and I had the worst experience ever the food was really bad and the service was the worst on top of it. I think this place needs to train Their employees on customer service and If you want to have customer who will return to your restore you should teach that female some manners. Once again like I sad before they made a mistake I just wanted them to realize it and fix it if possible I don’t want a refund. But that female’s behavior and tone of voice on the phone rounded my experience and my day. I will never order from There again ever. I hope the owner sees this and can actually fix his staffs problem.<//review><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None<//response><Gmap_id>0x80910773782224ff:0xd31699a7caaf541d<//Gmap_id></record>

First no one would answer the phone so I double checked on Google to make sure they were open. When I got their the girl didn't greet us & from what it sounded like she was watching some sort of Indian sitcom on her phone. Customers should always come first not your phone. I did place order for butter chicken &.naan & she said it would be about a 30 minute wait. So I go to Walmart to pass some time & come back and the food still wasn't ready. She goes to the side glass door to ask the cooks & comes back to tell me it would be another 15 minutes wait. I wasn't angry & I understand the restraunt industry. I waited the 15 minutes and finally received my food. I opened the box their in front at the counter & the  naan was burnt on the sides. I asked for a refund for the entire order & the girl raised her tone of voice saying that it is the way naan is cooked. Ive had naan before and it's supposed to be slightly golden never black & burnt. I just felt frustrated beginning to end otherwise I wouldn't of asked for the refund. I don't recommend this place.</text>

Food is delicious, but they need to work on there customer service. My husband walks in for a pick up and the lady couldn't even say hi, instead she just dogged stared him. She was not polite at all, we didn't feel welcomed.</Review>

<Text>This place is very flavorful. And if u like spicy , u can ask for anything to be spicy and it packs a punch of heat and layers of flavors! So good , I tried it to go without knowing exactly what I was ordering and I was extremely happy with what I ordered. my s/o was resistant to new food and he loved it too. Highly reccomend this place for a flavor town trip.< /Text><user_id>114635941064995908405< /user_id>< response>

< Review>
Good food for a small local restaurant. Food is a 4/5. Service 4/5. Atmosphere is a generous 3/5 (not someplace I'd take my wife on a date night, would just order as take out.) but is ok as a quick dine-in. Cost is 4/5 (fair), not cheap but definitely not overpriced.

Do NOT take this review as a negative, but a comparison to other restaurants. It is a small "mom-and-pop" style. This is more of a niche establishment that gives the community a valuable unique choice when the age old question "what would you like to eat?" comes up. I should note that I've eaten here over a handful of times since 2019, and return often when I'm in the mood for Indian cuisine (but am too lazy to cook it). As an aside I've been an amateur chef for almost 20 yrs and can duplicate most dishes by taste alone (no recipe needed).

Try them out for yourself. Its definitely worth a taste if you're looking for something different.< /Review>

<Review>If you like authentic, good quality North Indian food, this is the place to be. The place is pretty basic but the food is great. We ordered samosa chole with chai(which came in nice ceramic cups) as a starter and some main course. The first bite was so good that we ordered more appetizers and took our ordered food to go 😁.  I will definitely go there again when I visit town.</Review><Resp>None</Resp><name>Ajay Bathla<//name></record></dataset><record>

OMG, YASSSS. The food was so flavorful! Made my bf try it, we ordered spicy masala and koma chicken and garlic naan bread and it was so good. I love spicy and it brought the heat I love and balanced with such flavor at the same time. Was such a good meal. I highly reccomend. I hadn't even tried what I ordered before, I ordered blind and I was not disappointed.< /Text>

<Review>First time trying Indian food, came here to take lunch to work for myself and coworkers since they recommended here. The cashier looked like a young teen who hardly spoke English. I asked a question about a food on the menu and he wrote it down on his notepad as if I ordered it. Long story short, they forgot a container of rice in my bag and the cashier forgot to add utensils and napkins until I requested them.  But I won't let this place give me the wrong impression that Indian food service is bad elsewhere.</Review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

I am so happy I stumbled upon Punjab Express. The food is sensational. Full of flavor. One of the things I love about them is they have take out orders. Service is always good. Very friendly and welcoming. If you are looking for some good Indian dishes at a good price with excellent flavor I highly recommend Punjab Express.</Review>

I think the food was great! I order mild and was mild, curry chicken masala and the homemade bread. Delicious combination. I love it! Why not 5 stars? Because I don’t like the TVs in food places. Food delicious, kind services and reasonable prices. Thanks!< /Text>

<rate>5</rate><text>Food is terrific here. They have some of the best Korma I have ever had. Edit 7/19: they updated the interior, and it is a quiet and good looking place to eat now too. Really though, good food.
Bonus points if you can spot the lady in the green green dress more than once.< /text>< Gmap_id>

Spicy meant spicy! For any Indian resturant this has been my biggest issue when ordering but not here. The lamb was cooked perfectly and the  garlic nann had nice pieces of garlic in the bread. I will definitely be coming back.< /text>

<Review>Their good is pretty good. Avoid calling in orders as theres often a language barrier, misunderstanding, hanging up the phone or rudeness (maybe a cultural difference).</Review>< user>

<name>Erik Melin</name><time>1567524376537< /time><Rate>3<//Rate><review>The food was a bang for the buck. However there seemed to be a silent argument between the server that would rather mingle  around with other guests rather than serving us, and the lady that was constantly trying to get the server to do his job.

The overall dining experience was pretty bad but I would still recommend the food, if it's to go.
Also, don't install ceiling fans directly below the spotlights.</review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

The food wasn't bad but what I didn't like was paying the tab then going home and looking at my bank account and seeing they charged me more than what I originally paid for not just once but twice. They're sneaky and i feel like they thought I was too dumb to notice. Not coming back again. One star</text></record></dataset><record>

Just ordered food today from this establishment. Ordered 4 orders of Tandori Chicken to-go,  and thought it was funny when the lady wouldn’t let us check our order. Then we got home and figured out while....the chicken smelled ROTTEN! They cooked rotten chicken, and when I mean rotten, our family gathering of mine all smelt it to try and figure out if it was rotten, and you could clearly smell that half the order was rank. Hoping those of us that ate a couple of pieces before we figured it out don’t end up in the hospital.< /Text>

<Review>I love Indian food and this place is so great  to get it! You can come here with friends or dine alone and it's awesome! My favorites are the butter chicken and (when you can get it, sometimes they don't have it) the mango lassi and the garlic naan bread. On point. Also they have candies! 💖< /Review>< Pictures>

< review>
Every time we go here we ask for 4 orders of Naan (8 pieces) . We clearly explain that we want 8 pieces. When I go and pick up the order I ask again if they put in 8 pieces. The guy always says "yes". We never end up getting them.

Yesterday, I I took the time to open the bag and take a look. I complained and said that there was only 4 pieces. The guy said he would correct it and took the naan back into the kitchen as they forgot.
When I got it back I checked and it "looked" like there was more pieces.
When I got home and got ready to eat, I noticed he simply cut the previous pieces of naan in half.
The food's good but that was just straight up a dick move.</review>

Amazing food for a great price. Best Indian place in Turlock. The servers are quiet, which some people could see as rude, but we have been there several times, and they are really nice! Definitely recommend.< /text>

<Text>We stopped at Punjab express on the way back from Yosemite to bay area. We reached there 30min before closing. The service was good. Shahi paneer and chole were prepared fresh and served. The taste and quality of food was better than any restaurant in bay area. Price was also very reasonable.<//Text><Time>1480189274667< /Time><response>None<//response>< user_id>

We were looking for good Indian food and we were not disappointed. It's cozy and not overly decorated. We ordered chicken biriyani, Saad Paneer, butter chicken and garlic naan. We were very delighted with the flavors. Well be back again.< /review>

Todd Mains office staff are exceptional. Specifically Angela Hiatt has been overseeing my policies for years and is a joy to deal with when updates or changes to policies need to happen. Angela is hard working and always follows up and never gives an answer to a question she is not sure of. Angela will research and always has your policy and the best coverage in mind. All of the other office staff I have interacted with are very nice and professional, but Angela is the MVP.</review>

In mid-April, I was looking for a new insurance provider for home and auto policies. Out of the 6 leading insurance companies I contacted via initiating a quote request online, only 2 companies responded! One response was via an auto-generated reply email about 2 days after submitting the quote request; the other response was via a live, personal phone call within a day. That phone call was from an agent at the Todd Main State Farm Agency in Palmdale/Lancaster — Johnny Ruiz.

Johnny was thoroughly professional, knowledgeable, and patient as we worked our way through tailoring my new home and auto [plus a utility trailer] policies to fit my needs to a "T", not to mention my budget. The result: better policies than I previously had with more coverage at a lower premium cost, and lower deductibles across the board.

Thank you, Johnny! So, appreciate your help and personalized service.< /Text>

Me and my family have been with State Farm for many years. Every time I call, Diana Ramirez always attends me and I can say she is really the best! She is very helpful, nice and informative. She always has an answer to my questions, or knows where to direct me. I wouldn’t want to have anyone else helping me. Thanks Diana, you rock!<//text>

I have been with State Farm for over 4years now and having Angela as my agent makes things easier for me. She always answers my questions, calls back with the information in a timely manner, always willing to help, and has been one of the main reasons why I have not looked at other insurance agencies. She is the best. I highly recommend her and everyone who helps me out is so helpful!< /text>

Angela & Toni always go above & beyond! They make sure they answer all my questions and provide the information needed. I have used State Farm in the past, went to another company, but came back. The ease of being able to speak to someone personable and knowledgeable right away to help me with any insurance questions or issues is what brings me back. Todd Main's office has always taken care of me and I highly recommend them.< /Review>

I am extremely pleased with the service I received from Angela Hiatt at Todd Main's office.  Angela answered my questions then researched the effect on my policy premium to ensure I was paying the correct amount.   I could not be happier with the responsiveness and professionalism displayed by Angela and the team in this office.  Keep up the good work!</review>

I would like to thank Todd Main and especially  Toni Espinosa-Bona  for her excellent and personal professional service! I had a hard time renewing my policy and when I explained my concern to Ms. Espinosa She stopped all she was doing and took care of my insurance need as a highly skilled professional. I have nothing but praise for State Farm and people like Ms. Espinosa-Bona and Yes Mr. Main for their personal service which put customer FIRST.. We have been with State Farm and Todd Main for over 30 years! We also plan to stay with Him even longer. It's the quality of service as well as People Like Toni Espinosa-Bona who place people needs first!
Thank You Ms. Toni Espinosa-Bona  I slept very peaceful because

We have been with State Farm for years now and our agent Angela is truly the best! She is always very responsive and efficient in responding to our needs for our home and vehicles. She makes everything smooth and easy, and I always end our conversation with a smile! I am so thankful for State Farm!</text>

I recently was referred to State Farm and was helped by Toni. She is professional, attentive and patient! She was able to give me good info, help me save money, and give me peace of mind. If you’re deciding on an agent, ask for Toni! I will be using her again!<//text>

<pictures>None</pictures><review>So I got an online quote of around 567$ a month for the full coverage I wanted, I ended up not going with them due to the price but a couple days later Cesar reached out to me and got me a personalized quote and even stacked a life insurance policy on top of it to get me a bundle discount. Sure enough my new quit was sitting at 287 for the same coverage I wanted! Everywhere else was asking upwards of 400+! Long story short I went with State Farm not only because of the price but I know they will always go out of their way to help you! Big thanks to Cesar! He’s definitely the guy to talk to for a great insurance quote!<//review>< Resp>

I received a return phone call from Angela at State Farm Insurance. I had a couple of questions that I needed help with. Angela was very professional and helpful, but most of all friendly! She was focused just on our conversation and I really appreciated that. Angela helped me with my concerns and a couple of other items that came up in our conversation. I would highly recommend Angela!!<//review>

<review>I came to the Todd Main office from another State Farm office several years ago. My agent was and is Angela Hiatt and she is great. She got my coverage fixed and my questions answered. Since they are a full service office they provided advice on my life and auto insurance.

I recently had to file my first claim due to the Bobcat fire and Angela was the first one I called. She got things rolling right away. When I was able to access the property I met with the Adjuster. He pointed out several things that I hadn't thought of, like attic insulation, and he saw things that I didn't. It's been a long process and I'm nearing the end, I felt supported in all the claims I submitted. They really went out of their way to make me feel cared for. And that's because they really do care.< /review><Response>{'time': 1609384409879, 'text': 'Peter thank you for taking the time to write about your experience. Claim time is never fun but we feel good knowing you didn’t feel alone and that you were pleased with the process. Our customers mean so much to us. Thank you for allowing us to be there for you with your home insurance and recommendations for your life and auto insurance. I appreciate you acknowledging your interactions with Angela. She is truly an exceptional part of our team. We sure appreciate your business and wish you a Happy New Year!'}<//Response>< Rate>

As a new client of State Farm I didn't know what to expect. Being with AAA for over 15 years I can't say anything negative of them. We bought a new home and unfortunately AAA didn't insure our new area code. We were referred buy our real estate agent Mike Hrezo of Remax to Angela Hiatt of State Farm. If AAA was a 10 for us Angela Hiatt of State Farm is a 20. Her customer service skills and understanding of what you need without being pushing was a relief. I will simply tell you that you will not be disappointed. It's customers service on a whole new level here. Thank you........Angela Hiatt</review>

I wasn't seeking home owner's insurance.  A fried of mine, though, thought I could better coverage and likely a better price from his agent, Ms. Angela Hiatt.  I thought, why bother switching - the answer became obvious: the agent working with you and representing you matters.</text>

<Text>My husband and I just switched to Todd Main State Farm. We bundled our insurance and added umbrella liability coverage to our policy. Angela Hiatt was amazing! She answered all of our questions in a timely manner and she was extremely helpful, professional, and knowledgeable. Angela is so down to earth with a fun sense of humor. She made us feel comfortable during the process and kept us up to date on all changes. I highly recommend Angela to help you with all your insurance needs!</Text>< pics>

I moved to Palmdale in 2012 and immediately transferred my account from State Farm in Golden, CO to Todd Main here.

To my pleasant surprise I was contacted by Todd's agent Angela and have been treated to her bubbly self and professionalism ever since.

Each time I've contacted State Farm for Auto and Home insurance as well a Bonding my requirements were met quickly and efficiently</text>

I have had State Farm and worked with Angela personally for almost 7 years. I couldn’t imagine being insured through anyone else. Her attentiveness, positive personality, and dedication to me as a client are unmatched. From calling the office or even emailing my needs, I am always met promptly with a response. I couldn’t be happier!<//Review>

I was shopping for a new insurance company for months because I had issues with my last company when I had an accident. I went in and talk to Cesar Miranda, and he made it so simple and clear, He explained all the coverages to me in detail.  I know that I'm with a great company. Amazing service ! Thank you again Cesar !!! I am feeling a lot more confident on the road !< /Review>

I came with not a clue of what I needed in order to get life insurance for my son and I. I was lucky enough to be helped by Cesar Miranda, who made the process a breeze from start to finish. He is extremely patient. I highly recommended you ask for Cesar, you won’t be disappointed.</Review>< Pictures>

Always excellent service provided by Andrew Maxey. He’s always very helpful and prompt in responding to my questions. I had a question about my insurance rates and Andrew was quick to try to resolve my issues and help me to understand why this specific issue was happening. Andrew really puts his customers first :)</Text>

Obviously it's  natural to be skeptical about trying to get a new car insurance, but this morning I stumbled across Todd Main's office and had the privilege to speak with Cesar Miranda whom helped me get the best and most affordable auto insurance. Thank you Cesar for your help, and for answering all my questions. I won't go to anyone else for insurance your knowledge, skills and positive attitude is what got me the most affordable price for my auto insurance. I highly recommend Cesar Miranda thank you for the amazing service!!</review>

I live a busy life like most others and rarely have time to write a review but felt compelled to share my personal experience with Todd Main's office and my agent Angela Hiatt.
Back in 2012 my insurance carrier for 20+ years with policies for multiple homes, vehicles, boat, off road toys etc... decided to cancel my home owners insurance due to my zip code. I did everything I could to keep the policies but never felt like I was talking to or reaching the right person to discuss my case.
A friend of mine told me contact Todd Main's office in Palmdale California and that's when I met Angela Hiatt. Within the first 5 minutes I knew I was at the right place and talking to the right agent.
Angela Hiatt has now been my "Go To" for over 8 years now and always makes me feel like her #1 and only.
I often reach out to Angela throughout the year as my insurance needs change. Whether I'm buying another home, purchasing and selling vehicles or a teenage child with a new drivers license I know Angela Hiatt has me covered with the policy that fits my needs and at the right price.
Thank you Angela Hiatt, Todd Main and State Farm Palmdale CA for your amazing customer service and support. Looking forward to continuing our professional relationship for many years to come.

Sincerely, D. Lee< /Text>

Information is always explained in a way that is understandable for non insurance savvy people. Going into the office is a painless process, instead of being confused and feeling like you have to sell off your first born, you feel like you were just hanging out with family.

I have had State farm since I was 16 years old and would never dream of switching companies.  Over the years they have paid out on a 40k house flood in 1993, a sunk boat in 2002, an RV claim in 2005, and many auto claims.  Every time the claim was paid, it was always more than I expected and never had to do any fighting or arguing at all.  I switched to Todd Main agency when my other state farm agent retired in 2004 and have been with them ever since.  The last few years I have been dealing with Angela and she has been nothing short of outstanding in all dealings with her.  Thank you so much Todd and Angela for making my insurance experiences pleasant and stress free.</text>

Stan Main assisted us in transferring our insurance needs to Todd Main's office and we are very pleased to have made the change.  We know Stan to be someone who shows genuine care and concern for those with whom he associates - a valued asset to the office.</review>

<Review>Angela Hiatt is my agent and I swear she is a saint. She gets back to me promptly, within an hour usually for quite literally anything. New car insurance, earthquake insurance you name it, she has given me quotes and new plans same day.

<Text>Very thankful to Angela Hiatt for leading us in the right direction when I needed insurance to cover my families needs... The quote she put together beat my current provider (without an "agent") and she also made suggestions that will protect us in the event a real emergency happened... (why we have insurance in the first place).
Recently needed a insurance quote in another state and they were not able to provide it BUT she took down all the information, connected us to an agent that could and all i had to do was wait for the quote... That is Service!!   Thank you Angela!!!< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None<//Response>< gmapID>

<review>I have been with Melissa and State Farm for years. I have our auto, homeowners, and earthquake insurance with them. When I called Melissa to inquire about how much my rates would go up if I purchased new car, she told me exactly how much it would be AND informed me that they do auto loans. Melissa was able to get me a low rate and beat her the other competition. Plus it took all of 1 hour at the dealer since I had my own financing. Melissa is the best. Period. End of story. You will not find someone who cares more.< /review>< Resp>

<text>Angela Hiatt is by far the best insurance agent I have ever dealt with. She is so easy to work with, and literally makes everything about insurance quick, easy, painless, and simple to understand. Angela is honest, and caring when it comes to the needs of the customer. She is always there when I need a question answered. I won't go to anyone else for home owners insurance. Her positive attitude and her attentiveness is what makes doing business with the TM office a pleasure. . Thank You Angela!!!!!<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None< /response>< GmapID>

<Text>This office is both friendly and well versed in how to best meet your insurance and banking needs. Melissa has been my primary contact at the office for the past four years. She helped me get renters insurance when I got my first apartment, she helped me get a personal articles policy when I got engaged, and she now helps my husband and I plan for our retirement by helping us pick the most beneficial mutual fund and life insurance policies. She has your needs in mind and a simple conversation with her can make a difference. I highly recommend this office because it combines a hgih quality of service and professionalism with friendliness and an attentive ear.</Text><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

<Review>Angela is the best. They are extremely helpful and will always go the extra mile. I have been with them for years and will be with them for many more. Love you guys.
Frank Allen
P.S- The only drawback is that Angela won't wash your car again if it rains the next day. LOL. You all really are the best. :-)<//Review><user_id>109337589091786093808< /user_id><Rating>5< /Rating><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None</resp><Gmap_id>0x80c259b6a8b8168d:0x8023b4e462e43d4f< /Gmap_id><Time>1524337098753<//Time><name>frank allen</name></record></dataset><record>

Angela has been our agent for 6 years and has taken great care of us. She is honest and very knowledgeable in her job. She always has our best interest in mind. State Farm Insurance paired with Angela as our agent is by far the best decision we’ve made.<//review>

Just moved to CA from the east coast. Angela Hiatt reached out to me shortly after with the info from my previous State Farm agent. She quickly ran a few new quotes for me and had everything set up before i knew it. She was prompt, courteous and thorough with my questions and requests. I highly recommend working with her!<//review>

<text>Angela Hiatt is HANDS DOWN the best agent in this office! She is so easy to work with, and literally makes anything and everything about insurance quick, easy, painless, and simple to understand. I won’t go to anyone else for insurance because I know they could never measure up to Angela’s knowledge, skills, and positive attitude - it’s infectious! Our family has had Angela as our agent for at least the last 5ish Years, and we are beyond lucky to have her!< /text>< username>

To be honest I've never Met Todd. But Melissa Pleer is who I've always worked with from auto to life insurance. She's handled me in everyway she's the only person I've talked to about any of my insurance needs for almost my whole adult life. If you need anything she's who to call.</review>

Thank you to State Farm Todd Main's office was Awesome when it came time to get insurance on our New boat for our first trip of the season. Angela Hiatt was quick at getting us coverage in just a few days that other places had taken a week and still couldn't get it figured out. If not for Angela Hiatt's experience I know we wouldn't have been able to get it done.< /Review>

I have been buying my car insurance from Todd Main for as long as I've been driving, and I would never dream of going anywhere else. I really like that the office is local to Palmdale, which means I can actually walk in and talk to somebody if there is a problem. His entire team is amazingly professional, and are always willing to work with you if there is a problem. I highly, highly recommend Todd if you are looking to buy insurance.< /review>

<review>After not getting relief from my fall in November and regular doctor put me on nerve pain meds and prescribed physical therapy ( cant do pt if you cant get relief from the pain) I chose to try chiropractic therapy in April. Best idea I've had yet
I must say. I'm no longer limping and wanting to kill someone because of the brutal pain. I am able to get things done for a change.
The office is set up well and never a long wait. Front desk staff are GREAT!</review><pictures>None< /pictures>< gmap_id>

<review>I'm new to SDCG but been having back pain my whole life. My back recently acted up on me in the form of muscle spasms and sciatica. I work for a big box retailer and my job is very  strenuous. In past times I've been out of work as long as 4 months due to my lower back. A co-worker recommend Dr. P from SDCG and after a few treatments I was back to work in two weeks.<//review><pics>None</pics><response>None< /response><GmapID>0x80dc00718ace3a4f:0x3a8014ae68672c33<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Dr. Piriani is fantastic at finding and remediating my excruciatingly painful situation. I was in a severe amount of pain after a jump from a sand dune a couple feet high that set me up for a lower lumbar aggravated disc and pinched nerve after a bad night's sleep. I thought it was a strained muscle, however 3 weeks later and countless sleepless nights waking up in agony it was the Christmas holidays and I couldn't get seen by an orthopedic specialist until after the new year. I was sick of being in excruciating pain (8 of 10) and stuck hunched over with an inability to stand straight as my postural muscles were in protection mode.. Dr. Piriani was recommended by my Uncle as I'm new to the area, and he was able to get me right in Christmas week, and after the first visit and a few significant adjustments I noticed an immediate and serious improvement. 3 visits later and I'm feeling back to 100% like a new man! Thank you Dr. P for fixing my seized up back!<//review>

He takes a very conservative and gentle approach and never pushes too far.  Very considerate of over-use of x-rays and has a wide variety of tools to work with.<//text>< pics>

Assuming you called today, Fridays are very busy, in fact most chiropractic offices close early on Friday and we remain open until 7pm.

We have 2 receptionists on staff at all times and unlike most medical offices, keep our phones live during lunch time, which is when most patients get a chance to call and schedule an appointment.

<text>My naturopath sent me to SDCG after an auto accident last summer. I feel like I rediscovered chiropractic the way it should be practiced. Dr. Knepp's adjustments are spot-on. I felt very safe in his hands after the accident and he helped me through the swamp of insurance and medical referrals. Dr. Piranio fixed my plantar faciitis in 2 visits and identified my lifelong problem with proprioception deficits. The massage therapists are also top-notch. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!< /text>< pics>

<Text>I  LOVE This office. Each Doctor has different style and specialty they bring  to the table. I have been going to a chiropractor for over 30 years and Dr. Piranio is the only one who has been able to adjust my low back. Dr. Jarrah has a gental manipulative touch as she uses masage as she adjusts you. VERY Relaxing. Dr. McBride, is also very gental and is also into using masage and a holistic aproach to preventative treatments. Once you go here, you wont go any place else.<//Text><time>1473175168283< /time><pictures>None< /pictures>< Gmap_id>

<Review>One of my favorite rides around. Great views and smiling people all the way. It takes 35-40 minutes round trip from IKEA. You can get water before starting to ride the bridge and at the end of it. You'll also find restrooms and rest points. Very clean and safe.</Review><Resp>None<//Resp><time>1559180775555<//time><user_id>100644417457811885495< /user_id>< user_name>

This place has great views of the bridge and east bay.  There is t much else to see in the area but it looks like they are working to open up walking routes to eventually access the other parts of TI.< /Text>

<Review>Great trail for running.  Park at the Bay Bridge Trail Parking lot and run slightly uphill to Treasure Island.  When your are ready, run back on a steady decline than a flight part to the finish line.<//Review><Name>Phuong Trieu< /Name><Rating>5< /Rating><gmap_id>0x80858023b4d5c62b:0xcf1fae2f358ab74e</gmap_id><Resp>None< /Resp></record></dataset><record>

Probably good for bicycle riding. Not as good for hiking. A lot of car noise. There are a lot prettier hiking options in the Bay Area.<//review>

The dishes were fantastic. The place was packed by 6pm on a week night. The servers were extremely friendly and accommodating to our peanut allergy.

The ahi tuna was my fave!</Review>

Food consistency is great.   Owner is great.   If he's there staff is on the ball,  if he's off they aren't always as on.  :)   or as respectful:)

But it's the only waba grill in the area where the food is 100%:)</review>

<text>BEST TERIYAKI I'VE EVER HAD HANDS DOWN! Thousand times better than Flame Broiler! After going to Waba Grill many times abandoning Flame Broiler, I went back to Flame Broiler to give em a chance and the food does not compare to Waba Grill. I recommend the chicken-steak plate with brown rice and onions! The chicken and steak is so juicy and flavorful, the brown rice is so delicious and goes extremely well with their Waba Grill hot sauce. The shrimp bowls/plates are amazing as well! The shrimp has so much flavor! *mouth watering.*Service is excellent every single time I've gone there. They always have a smile on their faces. Food is done fresh and served fast! To add on top of that, they promote healthy eating which leaves me walking out with a peace of mind.</text><name>Joshua Anaya<//name>< pictures>

To be clear, this is not traditional teriyaki. It's good and reasonably priced, but the bowls don't have enough meat or sauce.< /text>

Horrible company. I worked with them two years ago to purchase a house only to find out that they would not honor the banks program after I was sold on it. As a teacher I qualified for this program, which they claimed to be experts with. It was arbitrary on their part not to go through with the program. I by-passed them and went directly with BofA whose program it was to begin with. They say a lot of things that sounds good but when it comes down to it, they really don't know the programs they are trying to offer. Their webinars are misleading and their reps will miss inform you. Fortunately, you don't need their horrible service, go directly to the lending bank. Scott's webinars come across as professional  but when it comes down to the brass tacks, they will leave you hanging in the wind. I receive a mailer from them every 4 months or so to remind me about the grief they put me through. Every time I receive one in the mail I call the rep Kathy Argento to tell her to have me removed from the list. Kathy who seems nice, tells me that she has passes it up to her manager to have me removed but I continue to receive the reminder. I've promised the company and their reps that I will leave a review of their company every time they send me a reminder. I'm once again following through with my word because they can't follow through with theirs. This is not the company you want to do business with when it comes to making one of the biggest purchases of your life.< /Text>

The prices showed on the web doesn’t much the prices you pay at the restaurant .its wrong to get over charged as showed on the web (maybe your order the food because it fits you budget when at the restaurant you get charged more  ) .custmet service 0/10. Very rude.< /text>

Nice looking Chinese restaurant, that is decorated lovely; pleasing to the eye. Blue and white China dishes and individual teapots for the tables that we're also pretty. The food was delicious, I had War Wonton soup, pot stickers and my friend had beef with snow peas. Food was delivered quickly, and appetizingly presented. The ambiance was such that you could actually hear yourself speak to one another, as the acoustics were done appropriately so that everyone could have a conversation.</review>

Will update after eating takeout.

The Google menu shows chicken dishes as 845.

They are 1145.

Overpriced mediocre Chinese food.

Do not recommend at all.<//review>

Enjoy Becky's brunch on the weekend. Always eat too much. Missed tgeir Calamari. My only vomplaint is that their chicken wings have gotten much smaller than they use to be.  In fact, it seems with price increase (@$5,25) the portions have gotten smaller. What's with that?</Text>

This place was great! Lower light, relaxed atmosphere with cool decor (boats! inner platform section!) Importantly, they had delicious food (chicken and snap peas was delish) and also good service. We went with a larger party (8 people) and everything went smoothly.< /Review>

<text>Becky’s used to be really good the best Chinese food I’d tasted in the area I always order the same thing but these past few times that I’ve ordered since The 4th of July the food has been terrible. No flavor,undercooked and skimpy. I’ve told a few people they should go there now I regret it because the food is not what it used to be. I don’t know if someone new is cooking the food. But it’s terrible.</text><gmapID>0x80857dc28c5c4f71:0x95aced7f0c3e4953<//gmapID><user_name>Des</user_name><rating>2<//rating></record>

Had about 10 items delivered to Oakland hills for a bridal shower. Yes they have a delivery partner... just ask.
It was some of the best Chinese food I have had. It’s the favorite Chinese food place of the hostess and earned many fans that evening.</text>

Great food , nice portions,  fast service , fair pricing . Loved it and will return.  Chow fun with Shrimp was perfect , I'd pass on the calamari , mushroom with bokchoy was actually bokchoy with some mushrooms,  decent brown rice and ask for the chilli paste.< /text>

OH... How my family LOVES Becky's. The best (non-greasy, not so traditional that you don't understand anyone in the restaurant) Chinese food around. I've got everyone in my family and my co-workers hooked!! The prices are GREAT. The staff is extremely friendly, fast and they have NEVER gotten my order wrong in the few years that I have been one of their customers. Across the street from the bart station. Parking isn't always the easiest... but because the service and food is so delicious, it's worth circling around the block a few times!! :) At my house... "Becky's for dinner tonight!" always gets a great response!!!</Text>

Not the greatest Chinese food in the world, but good. We went for dim sum and had: sweet rice, two types of dumplings, steamed shrimp, and beef chow fun. The tea is of the teabagged variety rather than loose-leaf.

They recently remodeled here and the decor is nicely done. There is a raised covered cabana seating area in the middle. The coolest thing inside are the intricately-detailed model ships suspended from the ceiling.

The bill was the best surprise. All this food for only $22!< /Text>

Honestly, I love this place. It reminds me of the Chinese restaurant in my hometown; cloth napkins, red tea, sweet people, and delicious (above - average in perceived healthiness and flavor) Chinese - America restaurant standards like wonton soup and Kung Pao whatever. If you want comfort food, get Becky's 💞<//text>

<Text>Ive been going here for years. This was my go to chinese food when I lived in oakland. They use very fresh vegetables- I recommend the won ton soup and garlic egg plant. Love their dim sum on weekends as well. Casual place with take out or large tables for groups.< /Text><pics>None< /pics><resp>None</resp>< gmap_id>

Pretty good Chinese food with quick service. I've always done take-out and everything has tasted very good. My favorites include the fried rice, general Tso's chicken, and the chow mein. Note that if you go with the soup, they are very large portions.<//review>

<Text>This review is mainly for the Hot & Sour Soup and the Sizzling Rice Soup. Both are really yummy. Couldn't ask for better soups at such good deals. Each small soup is about $4. The small to go sizes are actually bigger than I thought they would be. A small size of soup is definitely big enough for 2-3 people. If me or my boyfriend sick, the "healthy" one usually gets off at Rockridge Bart station after work, and picks up these two soups at Becky's for the "sick" one.

We did order shrimp chow mein here once. It was actually pretty good, but not as good as those two darn soups.<//Text>< pictures>

<Rate>5< /Rate><review>The park has a big parking lot and a good amount of space for picnics. There's a skate park a good distance away from the kids play area. There's also two tennis courts and basketball courts here. I even enjoy taking a stroll through the whole park, it's very peaceful and the greenery helps calm my mind. It's close to a residential street so it's fairly safe except for the far end of the parking lot. But definitely recommend coming here.</review>< Pics>

Ohh but the bathrooms don't have doors on their stalls so there's no privacy 😒< /Review>< pics>

Beautiful clean family fun park. I love it from the tennis to the basketball courts and the kid playing area its great also all the picnic areas are great. Like that they have the skate park on 1 end and kid playground on the other side as to not get small kids hurt< /Review>

Rialto needs to touch up this skatepark a little. Someone defaced one of the ramps with puck you. It looks as though they used to have a nice cover to give some shade on the skatepark that no one has replaced. There's a shoe hanging on one of the lines to the non existent cover. Can't say the best of crowd hangs out here when you have elementary kids that frequent the park. Just wished it was cleaned up and maybe monitored.</review>

This park offers amazing views of the Bay Area! Highly recommend for the beautiful views, even though it's a bit off the beaten path for many tourists. Don't forget to walk down the south side to see the mosaic steps! Beautiful.</Review>

This is a nice park with a lot of trees, grass, playground suited for older kids, basketball courts,  and tennis courts.  There is a skate park adjacent to the park and 99% of the time its just kids who want to skate,  every now and then you someone smoking pot close to the playground. I took off one star because there was a small playground for little kids that they removed and doesn't seem like they're planning on replacing itat this time.<//Text>

<username>Sin Siem (Ufoundsin)</username><Text>Nice park, just watch your kids because it's really ghetto. There's a nice skate park with a few cars in the parking lot smoking weed. I saw the cops searching someone in the further section of the parking lot. Afterwards someone was driving erratically speeding in circles in the parking lot.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

<Text>The skatepark here is top notch, it has just enough of everything, good flow, all around fun. There was a welcoming vibe which was super nice, some parks are super territorial like skateboarding is a gang activity or something...

It's like 3 parks in 1. When you pull up you can see the is my area for smaller children. Then further back is the play area for one for toddlers and bigger kids. Plus the slate park. My favorite park to take my kid.< /review>

Fergusson Park is always a delight. I come here very often to meet with friends and it is a generally safe neighborhood. The park offers two large jungle gyms, a skate park and public seating.</Review>

This park needs a remodel the sheltered areas are very dirty. The tables need to be redone, the playground turf needs to be completely redone instead of just patched.</Text>

<review>Fergusson Park to Kulim Park, via a scenic walkway along Tauranga Harbour is a pleasant way to spend a couple of hours walking whilst in theTauranga area. Great views of Mount Maunganui all along the way, with its majestic 230m high volcanic cone, and of the Port of Tauranga. Lots of benches scattered here and there for a rest.</review>< Pics>

Overall a nice neighborhood park.  It's well maintained most of the time; weekends get trashy due to the people there that don't pick up after themselves--Like many public facilities, I guess.  Our group walks mornings/evenings past this park; watch out for "rif-raf" that have nothing better to do than hang out--Again, like many public facilities.</review>
