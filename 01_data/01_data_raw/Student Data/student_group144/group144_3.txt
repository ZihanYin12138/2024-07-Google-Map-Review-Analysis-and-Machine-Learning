This is 3.5 stars.  Actually quite tasty. Went on the advice of a friend who joined me.  Knocked off half star for major price hike, which I can completely understand as former restaurant owner & covid-19 pandemic, but prices are double. Make sure to ask "market price" so you aren't caught off guard.</Review>

Never disappointed!!! Food taste is always consistent. Portion size is always great, the flavor is always on hit. You'll never get bored or tired of the food and their attitudes are so nice they are the nicest people that even if the food was not good their attitudes are so great it makes the food taste even better. Anytime you're in the mood for seafood crabzone is the place! Better than any seafood place in Stockton<//Text>

Over priced and it was $80 for just crab and when I told her what sauce I wanted she kept going back and forth with me for me to choose what she wanted me to order instead. I had to ask her “do you just don’t want me to order here because I’m telling you what I want and you’re telling me i should get something else”< /text>

<Text>Worst first time! I called in at 3:30 pm for a 4pm pick up. Got there at 4:10pm, food wasn't ready. I check in again, nothing. I'm sitting in my car and it 4:55pm and the food finally comes out. Worst place ever for pick up!< /Text>< user_name>

Haters could hate, but the crab zone is a force to be reckoned with. I spoke with the owner's son on why it was so pricey. It was because of the cost to sustain the crawfish. The crawfish is very difficult to sustain, so they have to bump up the price in order to be able to keep it for long. It is fresh, but cmon, you can't complain about the service since there is a LITERAL CHILD COOKING FOR YOU. I am not friends with the owner (Yeah i'm talking to you person who said anyone over 3 stars is friends with the owner), but would 100% recommend.<//review>

I personally get the headless, deshelled, veinless shrimp in the lemon sauce with the boiled potatoes... ugh just yummy! The garlic noodles are a bit oily so get ready for that, but it's all worth it. Thank for coming to my TedTalk.<//Review>< userid>

<text>First time at this place and it was a pleasant experience. Food was good, service was good. A bit on the pricey side generally speaking since the seafood didnt seem super fresh but good nonetheless. We had the bowl of shrimp with potatoes, corn, and sausage. Great flavor! Also tried the fish and shrimp. Those were ok. Frozen and a bit greasy, felt that meal was a bit pricey for the quality. Decor was cool and comfortable vibes. Would go back again. Strawberry lemonade was delicious!< /text>< Rating>

<Text>The price is wayyy on the higher side but it is sea food the server was really nice and professional. The food came out really fast and was amazingly delicious. The rest room was clean and nice smelling. The atmosphere was peaceful and quiet. My only gripe would be that they need to serve more of the food the proportion was so little and I ordered the biggest bowl they had.<//Text>< date>

<text>From reading all the reviews, I was a little apprehensive and was ready for a mixed bag of experience but my friend wanted to go there.
We got there real early, 5, so not to many people. Our service was fine and the food actually was very good.
It is a little pricey but they use solid ingredients and I would say worth it. I would definitely go there again.</text>< UserId.>

A hole in a wall spot! Every time I pass by Stockton, I try my best to give this place a visit. Their house special crab is a must. Eat with rice or fried rice if you must. The owners are down to earth and really friendly. Please open a restaurant in San Jose so I don't have to drive to Stockton.<//review>

One word, AMAZING.

Every single item on their menu is tasty. I especially like the Crab with its delicious sauce. Drizzle that sauce on the house special fried rice and you got a killer dish.

The owners are friendly and treats you like family. 5/5 would be back.< /text>

<review>It has fried clam strips, not found everywhere, although over cooked, it's still a find if you live in the Sacramento Delta area.<//review>< rate>

The food here is middle of the road the Crawfish seem to be imported all in all overpriced. But that's just my opinion.<//Review>

I ordered the garlic fries, and they were not very good. Customer service was not good. I won't be returning. I had another customer very rudely make comments while I asked the waitress questions. They didnt do anything. The shrimp isn't deveined. The cajun sauce is very liquidy and not thick so nothing has very good flavor.</Review>

I love hip hop and R&B. I walked in and they was playing music I like to hear when I would go dancing. I laughed because  Too $hort, Blow the whisle played... was not expecting that, but swiftly caught my attention,  then Minds playing tricks on me by Geto Boys came on, I knew every word...songs from the 90s. I love in love. Okay so we got crawfish, it was so good, was extremely pleased with it. We got 2lbs, 1lb of the Garlic and herb with med heat and 1lb with Cajun and mild heat. It was freshly killed I could tell. I also order the sweet potatoes and hot links from LA. The food had no complaint except, I burnt my tongue because the food was piping hot.  We will be back!!! Oh I think the place could hold about 50 guest but only one restroom (1 toilet) per gender.<//text>

My experience was almost like one of the other reviews. I wanted crab for my birthday dinner and my wife and son took me to The Crab Zone. Mistake!!!! It was very high priced and the service was p-poor. The waitress was more interested in trimming the plants than trending our table. There was one other table with 2 customers. The music was too loud and when talking to the waitress we had to have her repeat herself several times. My hearing is not good but my wife and son can hear fine. They couldn't hear her over the music.

There are many different types of music and my son enjoys many of them. He told me the music was terrible. That makes a statement from an 18 year old young man.

I asked if the one crab would be enough for the three of us. Her statement was it depends on how hungry you are. OK. I get that. One small plastic cup for a beverage and that was it. Didn't ask if we wanted more to drink or eat.

I would refer Denny's before this place. At least you get more than one drink and the waiters and waitress can speak so you can hear them.<//text>

<review>I was very disappointed with my $62 order.  Smh.  Everything but the shrimp was lukewarm even after I made it very clear when I would arrive to pick up my $62 order.  For 19.99 lb. the shrimp was mediocre at best. 😒 Waaaay over priced!!The lady who gave me my food even had the nerve to "warm up" my noodles in the microwave while I was there!! Seriously?!   What happened to fresh? 🤔The fried clams were rubbery.   We used to love this place 😣I WILL NEVER RETURN!  Worst birthday dinner ever!!!<//review><user_name>RChanel' Woods< /user_name>< resp>

<Review>Great food..  My original stars was 5 before today..  My bf ordered 1lb of crawfish and more than half was heads only with no tail..  I brought it to the waitress attention and she knodded her head n kept saying they don't cheat,  so then my bf got a bit upset bcs he didn't care paying for the food,  It was me just wanted to let her know my man was shorted..  Long story short..  Check them crawfish n make sure they have tails before getting started 👌btw.. I had the shrimp😊< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

My husband I and dine there for the first time. Nice fisherman wharf feel but really over. He ordered the crab in sweet garlic it was not good. Especially for a dungenese crab with empty shell and legs for $55. Went online no price on their menu for it. We were shocked. The appetizers were good. The ambient was nice but the main item was a not worth it. First and laSt time for me. Red lobster is wayyyy better and the price just right!<//Text>

We we're seated but that was all the service we received on my Birthday nonetheless! so me & my party of 9 left so I'm not able to vouch for the food only the service and it was a bit more that Domo's or Shirasoni in Stockton</text>

Took my wife here the other night and we were abit late. I think we arrived 20 minutes before close. We were nervous we wouldnt be served because of reading other reviews abou their service time policy. We were greated by the owner and sat immediately. We ordered a dozen oysters and the sampler appetizer. The owner was very nice and extremely attentive. Our waters and drink never went empty. He even threw in a few extra oysters for us. Their prices are a little high for a town like stockton but well worth it. We will be back very soon!</text>

Sauce on crabs were too salty, got our spice choice on our order wrong, shrimp needs consistency (some overcooked, some a bit raw, some just cooked enough). Minor things they can address to make the place great.</text>

Took my fiance here for our anniversary and the Menu wasnt categorised, they only sale crab as a whole crab, they didnt have any potatoes or Budweiser even tho it was on the menu. Umm lets see we ordered 2 buckets of shrimp one for my wife and one for myself and we wanted sausage and corn in both buuuut they forgot our sausage and corn in both. Just over all it was a big fail!! Would never go back! Never got asked if we wanted drink re fills or anythin. 👎👎👎👎👎👎< /text>

This place isn't that great. The service isnt that good. The prices for the food is  expensive. It is $12.99 lb for shrimp and crawfish. The sauce is extremely watery. Do not order the Crawfish. It barely has any meat. My boyfriend ordered crawfish and I orfdred the Cajun shrimp. The crawfish doesn't taste fresh and it barely has anything. Trust me you'll be very disappointed. I don't recommend this place at all. To expensive the quality is horrible and the service isnt that great.<//Text>< Pics>

The food and price in this restaurant were excellent! I've never been let down by something this restaurant has to offer. It's a lovely atmosphere and a quiet spot to watch the sunset. It comes highly recommended!</Review>

<text>We had reservations for heirloom and everything worked out just fine. I had a chicken dish that was extremely flavorful and delicious. The avocado was a great touch and although I don't usually like corn, it really worked with this dish. It was also spicy which I enjoyed. The bavette (steak) medium rare was lovely and i recommend that as well. My party split the strawberry shortcake and although i didn't have any, they loved it. The wine list is also quite extensive.</text>< Resp>

I walked in and politely asked for a table for two. A few minutes later, the host abruptly said "No tables tonight" and walked away. One would expect a more polite response for a restaurant of this caliber and price.< /Text>

Fantastic curated wine list and tasty pared down bistro fare. Our 16 year old daughter cut her teeth on the food here. Talk about an amazing food memory. Sage brown butter with fluffy gnocchi, indelible. We were sad yet glad this restaurant was revealed in the NYT. Join the wine club!< /text>

The food was great but the noise level was unbearable. My friends and I could barely hear ourselves speak. I realize the restaurant has a high ceiling and perhaps it can't be helped. I recommend it, but with reservation if you're sensitive to loud noises.</Review>

Made a reservation for three for my parents and I here on a weekend right after they opened up for dinner. The place was quite empty as they'd just opened, but slowly (not obnoxiously) filled up with [mostly older?] people. The interior of the space is gorgeous. Classic Southern decor with a modern exposed kitchen in the back.

The service was really fantastic. Definitely top 10 service experiences. And it felt really genuine too; didn't get the fake personality vibe from anyone.

The food was all perfect. We shared all our plates. The mussels were amazing. The cheese plate was wonderful. A bit pricey, but definitely worth it.

Also note: they have a killer wine selection.</review>

I have mixed feelings about this place. The ambiance was great - I felt like I was in another country and I really liked the decor. On the other hand, neither the service, including hostess or server, or food was mind-blowing, and it was a bit pricey for the experience. The gnocchi was good, and the chicken was good, but not the worth the price. The duck and salmon were so-so. The appetizers were good, but again, just didn't feel like the value was there, with so many other options in the city.<//review>

Just came home from having one of the best meals I have had in a long time. For many years, a girlfriend and I have gone out a couple times a month to fine restaurants in the Bay Area. We both agreed that we can't wait to come back to Heirloom. The food was so good and staff was so friendly and helpful.  What a great a experience we had tonight.< /review>

What a treat - honestly this might be my new hangout spot. I didn't have a reservation but the hostess promised to squeeze me in at the bar. The place was quiet and half empty at first but sure enough 15mins went by and it was PACKED. I mean people were being turned down left and right. We finally got sat at the bar and waited about 20mins for service, but the server promptly noticed we hadn't been greeted and offered us complementary glasses of wine. We didn't put up that big of a fight, and the rest of the night was amazing.

The food is brilliantly paired with balancing tastes and flowing wine. The scallops were cooked perfectly and the gnocchi was probably one of the best I've ever tasted. The portions are small but take it slow and you'll be full by the end of the night. We split everything for two and ordered 5 dishes - PERFECTION in every bite.

The chef personally came over to deliver each dish and told us to wait for the ceviche to finish marinating. I'm so glad we did because once again it was well worth any wait.

I will be back to try and taste more and hope that each time I can feel right at home in this cozy little Cafe.<//Text>

< Review>
Fun, buzzy, casual place. We joined in the atmosphere by ordering deserts first, then mains, then starters and no-one was the least bit fazed. First rate wine list with some amazing heirloom (sic) vintages, we drank Henzel 1975 pinot noir and an impressive Dunn cab sav from 1985. Yes, there was food too and I think it was good, but my recollection is rather impaired by the impact of the wine. LOL. Thought the staff were interesting and interested, they added wit and wisdom to the experience. Thank God for uber, Heirloom is a bit off the beaten track but I'd walk it, indeed I'd crawl back if I had to, it was really that good.< /Review>

This place is truly awesome. The food, vibe, decor. It has it all. It really shows that the owner is a sommelier in the wine list. The food is beautifully done, clean and elegant. It could be one of the city's best kept secrets. You certainly wouldn't know looking at it from the outside. It rocks.</review>

Too LOUD!  Advise the owner to add even more sound insulation padding throughout the rest of the ceiling and side walls (some pads on, but not covering all of the ceiling).  Hard to talk to anyone, left with a huge headache.  This is the loudest restaurant I recall ever eating in (noise level beyond many crowded bars).  Sad, as without this major issue, HC would be a great place to return to as the food and service were good.  Please address the noise problem.<//text>

The food is really amazing, seasonal and healthy. The downside is that the location feels a little distant. It feels like a place that belongs in Noe Valley more so than the Mission. While the food is great, it's a little on the pricey side.<//review>

Heirloom is perfect for an intimate dinner with friends or a date. The restaurant is spacious and comfortable, but the lighting is mostly candlelit and dim. The salmon was perfectly textured and was probably the best  I've had in SF. The side of broccoli was nothing like I've had before, you have to try it. Service was A+. PS. Thanks Flo for assisting with this first Plus review. Raph should be proud.<//text>

This is so good, but the portions are too small. Excellent service, wine, and food, but I am just not a about this small plate priced like a regular plate San Francisco nonsense.<//Text>

Heirloom Cafe is a bit off the "beaten track" in the Mission, but it is a fantastic choice for a group dinner or a more casual dinner for 2. The servers provide great food & wine suggestions and the menu is regularly updated based on what's in season. I've had some of my favorite meals at Heirloom.< /review>

Food is pretty tasty and service is solid, but portions are small for the price and the place is loud even when it's not full. Universal and Bon Nene are good options nearby if you can't get a table, which is likely for walk-ins.<//text>

<Text>The restaurant has inventive and yummy food, plus very knowledgeable staff to give you food/wine recommendations if you're clueless!

On top of it all, there's no crazy wait yet because it opened <1 year ago - so go there while it's still "underground"!

Only negative to their rotating menu is that my favorite dish - the gnocchi - was not on the menu when  went back for dinner a few weeks later =(<//Text><pics>None</pics>< resp>

< Review>
Came here for dinner w my guy.
The goods - very friendly staff and warm cozy lovely atmosphere.
The bad - tiny servings for a hefty price, and over-reliance on heavily salting the dishes, rather than the delicate flavors of food.
My boyfriend had the mushroom fettuccini which was composed of a small palm size serving of pasta and ONE mushroom sliced thinly.
I had the seafood cioppino - very very salty to the point of not being able to eat the broth!!! There was a dozen small mussels and 1 oz (possibly 1.5) of cod in the seafood mixture.  No shrimp nor scallops.
Fettuccini $27, Cioppino $30.
Suffice to say, we left the restaurant feeling hungry ;(.< /Review>

<Review>One of the best meals I've had in SF.

We started with two cheeses: both soft, creamy and surprisingly mild. Other appetizers were the burrata and scallops. For mains we split the gnocchi, hallibut, and burger (cooked with cheeses in the meats). All were equally stellar.

We had the recommended red wine: a metallic Pinot Grigio. Sharp on the tongue with a light finish. Perfect complement to the rich food.

Service was fine.

Ambiance was louder than expected but we were a group of three and they seated us at the end of a communal table and it worked perfectly. Conversation was intimate and we could drown out the rest of the noise.

Update after second meal here: just as god as before, but I was note conscious of how small the portions were this time.</Review>< Pictures>

Short version: it's good, it's expensive.  It might not be entirely fair to call it out as expensive, since what really made it more expensive than other similar places is that we got a lot more wine than we usually do.  But the restaurant is especially known for its wine, and they offer excellent pairings, so if you're not going to get the wine, why go?

Great food, great friendly, attentive, but unobtrusive service, nice semi-fancy, semi-rustic atmosphere.  And the wine was great.  It's always eye-opening for me to have wine well paired with food. I ordered a 2005 Rioja when we sat down, and we thought it was OK.  Later in the meal, the same wine came paired with my husband's entree (braised pork, polenta, maple-glazed delicata squash, orange-pecan gremolata) and it was 10 times better.  And with dessert we had a 2011 Jurançon Uroulat that was fantastic.

If we were in the mood to have someone hand-hold us through some excellent wines that can't be easily had other places.  But otherwise, for the money, we'd go to Blue Plate or Serpentine.</Text>

For an appetizer I recommend the roasted artichokes and for the entree, the sautéed local rock cod, cauliflower puree, English peas, ramps. It goes perfectly accompanied with the 2008 Pinot Noir 'Copain. This restaurant deserves 5 stars.< /Review>

Must try: corn soup, gnocchi with peas, flat iron steak, onion bacon tart. The owner always makes us feel so welcome.</review>

This spot is my favored. I go to plenty of restaurants but here I  constantly return again and again. The team is very warm and the cooking they serve is so tasty. I would always prefer to have a decent meal in this restaurant. I recommend this place with pleasure.<//review>

Had our banquet here and they were very professional with reasonable prices. Let us changed and tailor our menu for our guests. Close by our house. Parking is tight during the day but during our night was perfect. They provided live band and musician with no extra charge.<//Text>

<review>Came here for a wedding reception. The service here is slow! They even had the other half of the location open as a restaurant. It was very odd. They had to keep changing out food because they bring it out really early when guests haven't even arrived yet.< /review><Resp>None</Resp><Pictures>None< /Pictures><username>Jimmy Ly (SpicyRhino)<//username>< UserId.>

<Response>None</Response><Text>Food is below average. Menu options need improvement. Service is horrible and unprofessional. We saw one of the managers sitting down and chatting with the guests. Some of our orders were missing, and some were wrong. Servers' outfits (female's) are inappropriate for dinner occasion and the overall settings/ decor. The female servers have a difficult time walking up and down the stage/high steps due to their extremely short skirts. Our server had a bad attitude after us reminding her of the many mistakes we encountered.<//Text>< Pictures>

The animals are comfortable and not stressed, which is a huge sign they are doing something right. The vet we have worked with is knowledgeable, answers all my questions, and doesn't seem to be in a hurry to get to the next patient. The vet techs also seem very knowledgeable and treat the animals well. Also, it has been easy to get appointments - a big deal with all these new pandemic pets . I wish they were able to integrate some of the holistic care like Eastern herbs, accupuncture, etc., but it is very difficult to find somewhere that does it all.<//review>< Pictures>

< Review>
My dog has developed anxiety going to vet since covid and every time it breaks my heart seeing that she has to be so stressful going into the hospital without us. I am so glad I finally found Eastridge a fear free hospital in SD. they understood my concern and gave my dog so much love and extra steps to make sure she feels comfortable during the exam. Our first appointment with them went so well I couldn't even believe! ( in a happy way )  It was her first time not scared or looked miserable going to vet since Covid. I feel so relieved and so thankful for the Dr. and all the staffs that had helped us.</Review>

< review>
Upon receiving a serious diagnosis from a nearby hospital, I decided to bring my pet to Eastridge for a second opinion.

The staff and doctor at Eastridge were very pleasant, accommodating and thorough and discovered that the previous diagnosis was wrong, ultimately saving me money and saving my pet from unneeded treatment and stress.

I would strongly recommend Eastridge Animal Hospital.< /review>

<review>Really good communication skills during my kitty's appt, between the tech, whom we met initially for basics (info, and my concerns) and the veternarian.
Following that, we met Dr. Rosales who had a very pleasant, positive demeaner which makes a great difference to me.  If I am calmer, my fur baby is calmer.  This is Gretel who now LOVES pretend caves under a soft towel!<//review>< pics>

We initially loved this location many years ago for the great service for our dogs and experience. This past year has changed our minds and we are now going to a different Vet. The doctor is amazing with our dogs but her front office needs a lot of work with communication and setting expectations. Transparency is key and this was lacking in multiple recent visits.<//review>

<response>None</response><Text>Exceptionally professional.  Always a great experience here.  If they find an issue with my dog, they offer several options of care, along with thorough explanations.  I NEVER feel like they try to up sell me on some expensive, unnecessary treatment.

I have a GRUMPY, ALOOF chow, who growls during most of the visit.  Dr. Rodriquez is not put off.  She gets down on the ground with us.  She speaks calmly to my dog and gives her "cheese" as a peace offering.

The front desk girls are very accommodating and sweet. Easy to make appointments too. I would definitely recommend this place for your pet.<//Text></record>

Best vet I have ever been to. They are really dedicated to the comfort of your pet as well as the health. They go out of their way to make the visit as stress free as possible. They also have a place next door called The Little Cat Clinic where no other kinds of animals have been in so cats don't feel so anxious when they come in. The Veterinarians are top notch and the rest of the staff are amazingly knowledgeable as well.< /Text>

Love this place! Dr Rodriguez really cares about our dogs. She always tells us the options and we discuss the price vs the outcome before treatment. The staff is great and really seem to care about my dogs. They also have a physical therapy/rehab and a cat clinic right next door.</Text>

Their kind words and caring actions without a doubt, helped us tremendously. But it didn’t end there. It was such a wonderful surprise to receive a sympathy card in the mail!

I'm giving this place a five-star because the staff was really nice and attentive to my dog. The vet was really sweet and patient with my dog. The pricing was okay. The only thing that I didn't like was I asked for a quote to get my dog neutered, and they quoted me almost $700. I've never seen or heard of that  being so expensive. Why????<//review>

Both doctors I have seen spent a long time with us and gave us different ways to make our decisions.
Staff is great.  Love the fact when my teddy bear gets fixed she will be home that night.
Great place
Great people..< /review>

I love this place. The staff are all so attentive they even take notes on each animal they see in office. I called in to make an appointment for my dog to have her nails clipped. She absolutely hates it when my wife or I try to do it. I mentioned this to the receptionist and she told me, "oh well it says here she likes cheese when she has her nails clipped."  My dog Ruby loves coming here and she has no problem going in the back with whoever comes to pick her up and lead her in.  Do I recommend them? Absolutely.</Text>

<review>I have never encountered a veterinary clinic with more capable and kind staff.  Dr. Reece and Dr. Rodriguez are smart, down to earth, and caring, as well as being excellent vets who provide amazingly good care.  Their vet techs are wonderful and incredibly helpful.

They provided the most excellent care to my aged cat over the time we have seen them.  When my beloved kitty was dying -- of old age and chronic illness -- they were there for us.  They freely shared what they knew with us so that we could make her last days as comfortable as possible.  I will be forever grateful to them for their generosity and compassion.  And when I eventually get a new pet, I wouldn't dream of taking them to any other vet.< /review><Date>1540519786378</Date><user_id>102639725864748830252<//user_id>< Name>

<review>Dr. Sofia Padilla is the most awesome vet ever. She integrates both Western medicine / physical therapy and acupuncture for 4 legged family members. My doggie who had a bad reaction to vaccine boosters at another vet started having seizures. I saw her on television giving acupuncture and Charlie Bucket has been her patient ever since. Wonderful staff and associates.</review>< pics>

From issues large to small these vets know their stuff. I have an Australian Shepherd that has cushings and kidney disease and they help diagnosed it accurately and get us to a specialist right away. Then everytime I see them with another pet they make sure to ask about him without ever looking at their notes! That means the world to me.< /review>

<review>It's hard to find a great vet office but I just found the diamond in the rut. They were kind to my dog and instantly welcoming. I didn't feel as if they were pushing unnecessary treatment on me. The doctor was awesome with my dog and they were very understanding of my dog's behavior problems and catered to her. When it was time to pay I was not shocked with an outrageously large bill. They also give military discounts y'all.<//review>< pictures>

< review>
My rescue jack russell/poodle mix Davey is nervous around new people and bringing him in because of an injury doubled that nervousness. I myself was also very nervous since I do not have great prior experience with vets. The reception team - Jennifer and Jessica I believe - were calm and collected over the phone and kind and attentive in person. They helped this nervous dog mom keep my head and gave Davey a few treats to help him settle. Dr. Padilla was amazing with Davey (and me lol). She explained everything in terms I could understand and recommended some future treatment without me feeling pressured to do it right then - even offered me a sample sheet of costs so I could budget it. She talked to Davey through the whole appointment and he took to her quite well. Again, he did have an injury on his side that did turn out to be infected and given that Davey was a previously homeless dog - his instinct did kick in right at the end (thankfully after she'd gotten a sample) and he tried to snap at her. I was so nervous that would be the end of our lovely time here. But Dr. Padilla just rolled with it and let Davey calm down and gave him pets and eventually a treat - letting him know she was rewarding him calming down and not the snapping which I thought was very sweet. And then we moved on with the appointment. It wasn't mentioned again and I wasn't made to feel bad for my dog reacting. Both Dr. Padilla and our "nurse" (who's name is escaping me I'm sorry!) we're patient to my questions and explained the medications Davey needed to me and the reasons behind them and went over costs with me when I explained I had recently started a new job. By the time I paid the bill I was no longer scared or nervous and neither was Davey. We were treated so well here and with so much kindness and gentleness. After years of avoiding vets because of prior bad experience I can finally say I've found a permanent vet for my pets. Thank you all so very much.</review>

I love just about everything about this place. The staff are very friendly and clearly love animals.  The Doctors explain things clearly and give me options when possible. And they really go out of their way to make the experience as positive as possible for my pets.  I highly recommend Eastridge!</Review>

Dr. Reese takes time with your pet, explains everything thoroughly, and does not try to up-sell you on services or products your pet does not need.

When your cat is sick, life is very stressful.  Especially when you have no clue what is wrong.  Dr. Reese takes the time to explain things to you and makes sense of the chaos.  Time after time we have our sweet babies back to normal.  I will never take my cats any place else.  Eastridge Animal Hospital and The Little Cat Clinic are our go-to when we need veterinary care.  They are the BEST!<//Text>

< Review>
I just moved to La Mesa from Hillcrest. I have a kitty with some health issues and feel very lucky to have found Eastridge because the care there is # 1. I really like Jewels philosophy around treating cats where less is better. My cat had a skin infection that was misdiagnosed at the previous clinic I'd taken him to. I was at my wits end because it was costing hundreds of dollars trying different remedies while the poor kitty was being put through hell. I decided to change vets and by chance found Eastridge when searching vets closest to my house. I feel lucky since not only are they close but they are extremely good. Jewel figured out what was wrong with kitty right away and told me to stop doing everything that the other vets had me doing. She nailed it! It was an unusual skin infection that the others did not see and once we knew what the problem was and what the correct treatment was Kitty got better right away. And the best part was the cost. It was a fraction of what the others charged. I can't say enough about the care and knowledge at Eastridge!< /Review>

This is the only vet I have found that I love. They are all very nice and friendly, and I feel they actually care about my dog. Dr Reese is very friendly with the animals, she gets down to my dogs level and comforts him when he's nervous. Pricing is also very reasonable as well! Only place I feel like I'm not getting ripped off. Most importantly they always take great care of my puppy.</Review>

I've been coming to this hospital with my cats for years, even before Dr. Reese took over.  Since then I have been very pleased with the personal care given by Dr. Reese, Dr. Rodriguez, and the techs. Dr. Rodriguez has been treating my cat for the last 4 years and she truly cares about his needs, even called me after hours to check in and see how he was doing.  That gets an A+ in my opinion.  I am also impressed with how Dr. Reese has expanded the hospital to meet the needs of animals needing rehab or cats and their personalities with their own office space.  I think Dr. Reese and her staff are doing great things for the animals they treat.<//text>

<review>We've been taking our pets to Eastridge for over 15 years.  We've never felt a need to go anywhere else.  The new owners have done a great job of redecorating and bringing the business into the 21st century. We brought our pets in as babies and had have had to say goodbye to a few of them here.  I highly recommend Eastridge. They really care about your pets. And "Turkey" is entertainment while you wait.< /review>< Pics>

Eastridge Animal Hospital is THE place to go if you want integrity in business, the ultimate in pet care & love, and an appreciation for an owner/vet doctor/surgeon who BELIEVES in best service for honest pricing.  Dr. Reese is pragmatic in her decision making about care for our fur kids.  She will NEVER suggest a treatment that is not ABSOLUTELY necessary.  I have had experience with my emotions being prayed upon by being told costly unneccessary treatments were necessary.  But you don't know that's happening to you until you find a good and honest vet.  Dr. Jewell Reese, her other vet doctors, and her staff are the BEST.< /review>

Love Eastridge Animal Hospital! Dr. Rees is fantastic. She communicated the facts of the situation and presented the options and possible outcomes for our boy cat who has had 2 FLUTD incidents in his young life. Scary stuff to see my big boy cat with a catheter! We love the office's "stress free" approach and the fact that they have a Rewards program is just the icing on the cake. It helps to make more affordable the prescription cat food we now get to feed our cat.</text>

<Review>I highly recommend Eastridge.  Dr. Reese is real find - particularly with "difficult" pets.  She takes plenty of time and tells you all the treatment options.  She is particularly attentive after any sort of surgery or procedure.  She has always called me later in the evening to check on my pet.

The rest of the staff is great and I love all the doggie greeters!<//Review>< UserId.>

We were duly impressed by the care given by the practitioners at Eastridge Animal Hospital. Because of limited hours by our 'regular' vet we had to take our our cat there out of desperation and we were so impressed that we have switched to them for all of our animals now.  They have great hours, their staff is fantastic, the Drs are patient, and explain everything to us, and they don't try to push 'extra' procedures and products on us unless  its truly necessary.<//text>

Even though she thinks she doesn't want to be there, they are able to work with her and she trusts them that they are taking great care of her.  For 7+ years now!  I highly recommend Eastridge Animal Hospital and have referred many friends and family to them.</Review>< pictures>

They have taken excellent care of my cats.  Always call the night of any surgeries, dental cleanings & the next morning. I really appreciate this.  Can't wait until the cat clinic is open.</text>

<Text>This office is a bit far from where we live so I only go there when it's a more complicated or urgent matter for my pets.  They are always helpful and try to squeeze you in.

<time>1483115640708<//time><text>Eastridge Animal Hospital is amazing in all ways.  I have never felt as confident in a veterinary clinic's doctor as I fell about Dr. Reese in multiple ways:  first off, it is easy to schedule appointments for routine visits; for emergency visits that arise, they have always worked my cats into the rotation on the day that I called, which provides me great relief and appreciation; Dr. Reese makes me feel as though she is treating her own 'children' when she takes care of my pets, showing great concern for their well-being; finally, Dr. Reese ALWAYS finds the most reasonable financial methods of caring for our cats.  When we have done teeth extractions, her fees are lower by 25% than our previous vet yet I am more confident in Dr. Reese.  Another great example occurred on our last trip - one of our cats had been throwing up constantly.  Dr. Reese did a lower cost x-ray in hopes of finding the problem, prescribed some medication that she thought would take care of the issue, but also set us up for another appointment to do a more expensive procedure in case this first option didn't work.  Well - the first (lower cost) option did work and our cat responded well.  I am pretty sure that many vets would have done the more expensive procedure on my first trip......
In summary, I couldn't be happier with a vet than I am with Dr. Reese!  Trust her 100% with your pets since she will care for them as they were her own and also is consistently trying to find the lowest cost way of helping them.

I find the staff and doctors at Eastridge Animal Hospital warm, friendly and very professional.  I would recommend them highly.

Sadly, I recently had to say goodby to my beloved little dog Max.  The folks at Eastridge made this difficult time a little less painful with their sensitivity and support for Max and for me..< /text>

< Review>
For the past years Eastridge and Dr Jewel have been the for The West Coast Pugs!  Porkchop, Popeye and Senior Bear all love the Eastridge staff.  Porkchop even looks forward to her laser and swim with Becky and Renee!  My People always recommend Eastridge when someone needs a vet!</Review>
</record></dataset><record>
<Review>I beg to differ with the a few of these reviews! Dr. Reese is one of the most conservative vets! She has always been wonderful when she worked at the previous vet office. I disagreed with a diagnosis and treatment plan for one of my dogs at the "other office". I took him for a second opinion and Dr R was very conservative and the original diagnosis was incorrect, therefore the treatment plan that was recommended would have been very costly.  I have the utmost faith in their office. She is very conservative when recommending treatment plans and medication.  The staff is very friendly, not only to me but my dogs.</Review>< Pictures>

Extremely impressed. Not only was our dog Thelma diagnosed with Lyme's disease and treated but they also figured out she had a severe pinched nerve in her right shoulder. I've been to many veterinarian clinics and we've had  many beloved pets,  I'm extremely grateful for   The warmhearted service offered by everybody and how they treated our pets. Where everyone else failed to diagnose correctly this clinic did! I cannot stress upon your how important that is. Not many veterinarians would understand lymes disease and the complications caused by it . We are eternally grateful.  Must understand we thought we were to lose Thelma because of the excruciating agony she was in for three months. Once again thank you all at East Ridge animal hospital.
Friends of ours have relocated from London with their pets to San Diego we will highly recommend Eastridge animal hospital

<rating>5< /rating><Text>I have only visited this hospital twice but have had exceptional experiences both times. I already knew my dog had cancer when I had my first visit with Dr. Warriner. The tech examined my dog first and spent about 15-20 minutes just talking with me. She made me feel like she cared about my dog and I didn't feel rushed as I have in the past. The Dr. spent a very long time with me just talking about my dog and explaining what methods of treatment are available for his condition etc. We did x-rays (reasonably priced I might add) and she did find that he had a tumor. I felt so much empathy from her and after the visit I knew exactly how to care for my dog.

I also emailed a week later with questions about medication. Dr. Warriner left me a voicemail after hours and told me she arranged for me to pick up some meds for my dog at my nearest convenience. So helpful.

The office staff is friendly and efficient. In the past I have always felt that I'm "bothering" the staff with my questions but not this time. Can you tell I love this place? Their waiting area also has a nicer atmosphere than most places.</Text><gmap_id>0x80d95720eb2dbf8f:0x8ffb177b6492116d<//gmap_id><Time>1375979821563<//Time><pictures>None< /pictures>< UserId.>

Dr. McKittrick retired and the clinic was taken over by new vet.  She is consistently late for every appt.  The prices are much higher and she recommends tests that the dogs don't need.  The front desk and back staff do not communicate well if at all.  The only wasy I will go back is if they get a new Vet in their practice.  Dr. Reese is and was always late at the practice she was at before this clinic.  She will never change.</text>

< Review>
Parking can hold about 12 cars and free, most building are closed, so you'll be able to enter about 4 of 20 of them. Nice place to walk.

Edit: I went back during the week and the site was open but all building closed. Still nice, but you can walk the whole site in 30 minutes.< /Review>

If Christmas in the Park wasn't already unique enough to San Jose, now it's added to History Park, which holds so much of San Jose's past. It was a feats for the eyes. Make sure to follow the music and the lights - they're synched. If I had to choose 3 favorites , it would be the Spirit of 45 display, the gas ⛽ station, and the "You Matter" tree<//Text>< Pictures>

<Review>most of the times that I have been here have been for automotive related events which this place makes a great background for.  Even with out the auto events though this place is a great spot to visit.  Plenty of exhibits plus a lot of info on the history of the area.  A great spot for Holiday photos as well once their decorations are up.< /Review>< Time>

History San José is a living museum that teaches people through reenactment and display. The blacksmith uses tools to show how they were used to mold, bend, and forge. The print shop shows how printers worked with type, ink, and machinery produced news print. Some of the display collections like steam tractors and railroad engines are fascinating.< /text>

Amazing event venue. By itself it is a wealth of information about San Jose in times past. From the hotel to the candy/ice cream parlor,  the fire house to the trolley. Great place.  I  learn something new every time I go.<//Review>

<review>This place is full of interesting historic stuffs. You can also enjoy laid-back time here. You can have free historic trolley ride here in scheduled weekend. Sometimes, they drive the trolley along the Senter road to Happy Hollow Park and Zoo and back. Don't forget to donate and support them because they are volunteers and need budgets to maintain trolleys and pay electricity bill to give everyone free rides.<//review><Rate>5< /Rate><UserId.>104496875175619588701</UserId.>< Time>

<Text>Hidden Gem of Historical Information!   This small recreation of a town is quaint and charming with it's repurposed and recreated period buildings.   Aside from providing a home for historical records and mini-museums representing many of the founding cultures that make up the bay area, but they also have some salvaged landmarks.
I was here for a school tour, but I would love to go back another time and dig a little deeper.< /Text><Response>None</Response>< UserId.>

A true gem of San Jose, over 35 historic structures, many which are unique cultural non-profits that discuss culture and arts. Best part, it's free to the public on most days unless there is an event planned. Check out the Light Tower and ice shop. I can't wait to see how the history park grows to encompass new non-profits.<//text>

This is a really cool part of Kelly Park.  This is basically a resting place for buildings from San Jose's past, including the light tower, and numerous homes belonging to important people from San Jose's history.  The printing press (still working) and locomotive museum are really cool.  Includes a working ice cream shop.</text>

<text>Walking back into history with this fine little park is a wonderful and free experience.  Trolly car runs still, older ones are being restored in the "barn".  There are special museums for the various ethnic groups who had a great deal to do with forming San Jose into it's wonderful present.  The Portuguese & Vietname homes are filled with history that will enlighten you and make you grateful for these people and their contributions.< /text>< pictures>

<Rate>3<//Rate><review>The 'park' itself is very nice and for being a free place to take kids or adults to learn of the SJ/Santa Clara Valley past you can't beat it.  I will say the fact that all of the signage  points you one direction for the parking lot and then walking 2 blocks another way for entry is very odd.  There is a gate right there that is not being used!!!   It could use more of an 'entry' education area as  you walk through a gate and don't know where to start.  Its like if you all the sudden found yourself at SpaceShip Earth at Epcot but didn't remember paying to get in, looking at informational signs, or having apps to lead the way.  Worth going.  Parking is $6 flat for the day (visit the Japanese Gardens too) or street parking<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None< /Response>< Gmap_id>

Today was the annual garden vegetable plant sale. The prices were good for a wide variety of tomatoes, corn, herbs, chiles, okra, cabbage, lettuce, you name it they had it. There were also seeds and cow compost for sale. Hand made items were on sale by a large variety of vendors. Many of the historical homes and museums were open, and the Pacific hotel ice cream shop was also selling ice cream. There were several food trucks and carts selling food for lunch. It was a warm sunny day and the History park was packed, but parking was not bad and walking around was pleasant. There were many friendly people and many master gardeners dispensing advice on the plants they were selling. I bought three varieties of tomatoes and three varieties of chiles. The prices were 3 for $10, which is a good deal. It is best to come early as the plans sell out quickly. Awesome event is held annualy.</text>

The website says open Monday-Sunday, but only the front gate is open. You can only walk around the and see the outside. The people there get grumpy if you even try to look in the windows. Only open Saturday and Sunday. The Chinese museum is only open the 1st and 3rd Sundays.</Text>

<Review>(Translated by Google) The story of San José is brought to a living museum. People can be shown through reenactment and exhibition or with help. The blacksmith uses tools to show how they were used for forming, bending and forging. The print shop shows how printers worked with type, ink and machine-made newspaper printing. Some of the exhibition collections such as steam tractors and locomotives are still in good condition. Also schools come here to get to know the former way. The people here are very friendly and helpful. They explain very nicely what you can do. The terrain is not big, if you just want to look at it, I think you're done in 2 hours. But you have a lot more fun when you also work with and practically learn.

Die Geschichte von San José wird in ein lebendiges Museum gebracht. Menschen können durch Nachstellung und Ausstellung gezeigt bekommen oder auch mit helfen. Der Schmied zeigt anhand von Werkzeugen, wie sie zum Formen, Biegen und Schmieden benutzt wurden. Die Druckerei zeigt, wie Drucker mit Typ, Tinte und maschinell hergestelltem Zeitungsdrucken  gearbeitet wurde. Einige der Ausstellungssammlungen wie Dampftraktoren und Lokomotiven sind echt noch in einem guten Zustand. Auch Schulen kommen hier her um die frühere Weise kennen zu lernen. Die Leute sind hier sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit. Sie erklären sehr schön was man machen kann. Groß ist das Gelände nicht, wenn man sich das nur ansehen will, denke ich ist man in 2 Std. fertig. Doch man hat viel mehr Spaß, wenn man auch mit arbeitet und  praktisch mitlernt.

Prices are very reasonable. Business is open 24 hours for any tire problem.
Thank you for fixing my flat at 8pm.< /review>

<Rate>1<//Rate><text>(Translated by Google) I don't know how the service will be, but the truth is that 24 hours do NOT work. On Saturday at 11pm I needed to have 2 emergency tires repaired, I arrived at the place and it was closed. Dial the 2 numbers that are written there and nobody ever answered. And thankfully, the local says they work 24 hours and is totally false. To place false information ???? DO NOT WORK 24 HOURS

No se que tal será el servicio, pero lo cierto es que 24 horas NO trabajan. El sábado a las 11pm necesitaba que me repararan 2 llantas de emergencia, llegue al lugar y estaba cerrado. Marque los 2 números que allí tienen escrito y nunca nadie contestó. Y menos mal que en el local dice que trabajan 24 horas y es totalmente falso. Para que colocan información falsa ????

I wish I took a picture but the chimichanga I had was amazing. It was a carne asada chimi and I had them.make it wet with red chili sauce. The meat was tender and flavorful. The beans and rice were amazing. The salsa had great flavor but would like it a bit more spicy. 🥵😂. Will definitely come back here when i.come into Delano again.</review>

I am not the type of person that likes complaining or giving bad reviews but sometimes that is the last resource you are left with. The food is not the issue here but their customer service. We have been there only three times. The first time we were a big group so we didn't mind it took a bit long to get served. The second time it took about 15-20 for someone to approach us and offer menus and drinks, again we didn't mind since we were having a nice conversation. We were 4 adults. The las time it was tonight 09/27/19. Oh my, tonight was the worst. I do want to make clear that we did notice they were understaffed. Anyways, we waited for 20 minutes without anyone even acknowledging we were there. I see the waitress and ask her for menus, she said give one minute, 10 minutes passed and she didn't approached us, my brother asks again and she finally approaches. She tell us with an attitude, "I am understaffed, I don't have any menus and I have other tables. At this point we say ok, we stand up and start to leave, she says whatever and approaches another table and asks; have you been helped? My family is already at the door but that made me mad so I asked if there are any business cards, she turns around and says no. We do not work with business cards. I say ok, can you tell me your managers name? She answers, she is not here today and you don't need to call her. At this point I can see she is upset and starts to get defensive telling me she already explained she is understaffed and busy. I tell her, I understand and that she does not need to raise her voice, to calm down. She starts talking over me to tell me again she is busy, understaffed etc etc. At this point everyone is looking at us and the last thing I tell her before walking out is. I understand honey, we are leaving not because we waited for too long but because you didn't even acknowledge us, not even to let us know that you saw us, to let us know you were busy and that you were going to be with us as soon as if was possible for you. I walked out after that. The reason we are never going back is the fact that she didn't even looked at us once before I approached her the first time and that was after 20 minutes of being sitting there.</text>

My husband and I have been there 3 times. The first time they were about to close and we ordered 2 Vampiros each. They were served nicely but in a toasted store bought tortilla. The second visit my husband ordered 1 vampiro and it was served in a hand made tortilla. I ordered a Molcajete Sinaloense and it was pretty good I'll give them that. The third time the owner was not there and there were only 2 women attending the kitchen. My husband asked for some shrimp with rice and beans(he didn't like it) I asked for guacamole and was told they didn't have aguacates. But I see different plates coming out the kitchen with aguacate slices, like wth? So I asked for a vampiro and they took forever and a day only  to then find out that the tortilla wasn't even toasted, it was like if I asked for a big taco! Never going back again. Making food FOOD is not their forte.</Review>

great selection & have always been greeted by friendly and helpful employees :) not entirely their fault but parking does suck during busy hours. i do love that they offer email receipts though, i know not all locations offer that< /review>

<rate>4<//rate><Review>A little after Xmas cheer. Very little, but you can not have it all. They are in the process of selling off Xmas goods. An cleaning up the selections. Good for bargain hunting. The prices are very cheap, the goods are not. Some really good brands dirt cheap. If not what we all are after....< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< gmap_id>

Store officially works till 7 pm.  They don't put people to the dressing rooms. So, we bought some cloth, back home and get back to the store at 6.30pm. They not let us in, because "we closed". I spent my time and there no sign of that store will not allow people come in after 6.30.< /Review>

Damn i scour these aisles for deals and I get 'em. The cashier line is slow as hell, so I literally just put the stuff back and leave sometimes.
BUT, you can bring your dog in and just look around, have a good time. They are super friendly and the deals are usually off the chain.</Text>

<userid>110964380504416064948< /userid><review>Really love this store. Especially the beauty area, find lots of treasures.great for really cheap birthday gifts. Recommend during the holidays the philosophy Christmas packs. They are like "49$ for 83$ value" so they are even cheaper their. Also recommend for pillows have a great selection. They also have many hidden treasures. I got some great quality plaid pants here. I also go some fuzzy socks the were fuzzy. Don't recommended the "Alaffia" conditioner literally does nothing. Returns are really easy great store< /review>< Name>

<text>Good spot for inexpensive home items and pet toys. Sometimes you can catch brand name hygiene items for low cost. Parking is a bit crazy at this location so if you don't mind walking 100 meters you can park by BofA and walk over.< /text>< Pics>

This particular Marshall's on Bascom in the Pruneyard has always been one of my favorites.  I can usually walk in there and find any number of goodies to satisfy my retail therapy session.  The store is well-organized and relativey neat and clean. It's hard to keep these place looking like a fancy boutique, but the staff do a good job of trying.  Each store has it's uniqueness and this one has a great shoe department for women.  I was in there in the last month and picked up a few tops for summer wear.  Love Marshall's family of stores. One thing about this store is that parking can be challenging especially since the entire center has been in renovation for over two years.  Things are calming down, but this store's parking area is relatively small.< /review>

This is well-organized store compared with others. Unfortunately, they removed Petite section and expanded Women's Plus section which doesn't work for me. However, I was able to find something useful with a reasonable price. I bought a nice size travel cosmetic carrying case with a hanger which was not bulky like others.<//Text>

Very much liked the service!!! Ptices ate prety good too. Only thing I would improve is the mess - inorder to find something in a certain size in the kids' clothing you have to go through the whole kids' area because the sizes are all mixed...</review>

This store has great bargains!! There are alot of shoes, clothing and hygeine items for super low prices. The racks are full of great deals. The clearance racks have even better deals. The location is great. There is plenty of parking. Employees are friendly and the checkout lines move quickly. Overall, a great shopping experience.<//Text>

I don't like the TJX credit card exclusivity. I had a 650+ credit score and no late payment record, etc and they would not approve me although Kohl's did right away. The store is okay except it's hard to exchange items b/c they become sold out almost immediately. I like that they have like two brand names I like which is Vans and something else.</review>

<Review>I was looking for a new carry-on suitcase and wandered into this Marshall's.  Limited selection, as is typical of Marshalstore.Everything seems a little picked over, and the luggage was hard to find.  Employees were not available to help.  Anyway, there were 2 possibilities, a very cheap one and an expensive leather one.  Both were over 50% off the tagged price.  I opted for the leather one at $400 (regular $895), and have been very happy with it.  Nice bargain hunters store.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

Not much of men's stuff, but just about a regular Marshalls. Low end fashion and stationery.
There's always lot of people, this being in pruneyard and also convenient if you are in Campbell.
It's reasonably big and organized.<//Text>

< Review>
Typical Marshalls. Lots of variety, constantly changing inventory. Decent prices on name-brand merchandise. It's my "go-to" shop for retail therapy!</Review>

To be honest I enjoyed the store, but It gets kind of annoying be waiting there while women do whatever they do 😂. They should put some chairs or something.<//Text>

<review>(Translated by Google) Here at Marshall what happens is that it is expensive and the sizes are extremely small girls so for regular people like me who do not have an extreme size but if an extra size does not find its measurements here Good luck for the next

There are a lot of special products, especially the brand-name clothing, cosmetics, shoes, bags, etc., and the products that are slowly selected will be very value-for-money. But take a little more time and have patience.

這間店是系列裡較高級，貨品較多的一間，非常好逛，好買。特價商品超多，尤其是名牌服飾，化妝品，鞋子，包包…等的過季商品，在此慢慢挑都會找到非常超值的。但是要多花一點時間，有耐性。</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

Kind & clean atmosphere. I was pleased with my experience until time to pay. Suddenly every nail shops' card reader is "down" Beware... Bring Cash🤔 I personally don't use random 🏧 ATM machines not attached to a bank🙄 but they do have one... " So conveniently" 😉... 😇 All in all I liked the service and results, I will be back w/designated cash😏< /Text>

Just need to clean products for pedicure cause no one wants to catch fungus :) prices must be spoken about ALWAYS before work is done. We love that.!

Wanted to tip great but needed that communication of prices because of how I manage my money accounts.

Thank you! Definitely comming back<//Review><rate>5<//rate><Response>None<//Response><UserId.>110395346104593618659</UserId.><time>1623014294229< /time>< name>

<user>108435783186380198923</user><Review>DO NOT GO HERE!
This was my second visit here since the first time I got a major eye infection based on their lash extensions. I figured I can get a quick pedicure today
So I went in there today asked for a Basic pedicure for a value of $22 and eyebrow waxing for $10
As I was about to pay they charged me $45. When I mentioned the math didn’t make sense he started adding pricing to the nail clipping the gel etc.
Same girl went in to do my eyebrows didn’t clean her hands after doing my feet.
I didn’t get a mirror to see the final look either I get in the car and one is thicker then the other
Over all extremely unsanitary and bad quality service not to mention they ripped me off
DO NOT GO HERE!< /Review><Time>1621557828815</Time>< rate>

<rate>1<//rate><text>The guy did a HORRIBLE job and yelled at me cause he thought it was good and wanted me to pay I refused to pay for his work. The lady redid them and did a little bit better. The way the guy did it was looking like I already needed a fill the nails were shaped horrible lumpy in some spots. I couldn’t get a picture of both hands but I won’t be returning. I wanted to cry I was so upset with my nails. The ladies were really nice and apologetic and seen that he did do terrible.< /text>< pictures>

I love this place,  the open space inside makes me feel good. Not like other places where you feel other people are so close to you. Kim and Amy, and Jenny are the best. Always great service and do an amazing job.  Everyone is so friendly.< /review>

<Review>Came here because I was in a rush and I thought I was lucky to have found a nail salon with no wait time. That should have been my red flag. I got a pedicure which wasn’t great but decent and a gel manicure. My nails look like my little sister painted them but yet I paid professional pricing for this. They pretend to cut my cuticles but clearly they didn’t. They just painted over the cuticle and didn’t even shape my nails evenly and a couple of them look like they will lift by tomorrow. Despite all this I left a small tip and they seemed offended by it. Don’t come here there is a reason this place is always empty<//Review>< Pics>

<resp>None<//resp><username>Melody Zamora<//username><review>I went in two days ago to get eyelash extensions and they already fell out. I really loved how they looked and everything. I didn’t put water on them. I didn’t pull on them. I slept in my back to make sure they don’t get messed up by the time I wake up. They ended up falling off anyways. At first it was just one, which fell off the first day after having them. Then the second day, SEVERAL fell out. I feel like when she was doing them, she was doing fine at first, then more people came in and she started to rush. That’s why they’re only falling off from one eye. I want a refund< /review>< pics>

<Review>I had just went to days ago as a walk-in because I had called before and asked if they were taking any walk-ins and they said that they did. My experience was really bad there they had put me with a new worker and she wasn’t doing her job correctly. Once she started doing my feet all she did was a quick clean up and right away she wanted to start on my toe color but she had forgot to massage my feet just as how the basic care comes. She had also forgot to do the basic scrub. It should not be my job to tell them how to do their job when I am paying them. When she finally got to Painting my toenails she coded them unevenly on my left foot they had about four coats and on my right foot they only had two she had also accidentally took off some nail color with her finger and when I told her if she could fix it she did not acetone the fingernail all she did was paint over it and now there is a dent in my nail very poor job if I could give zero stars I would. Will never go back!!< /Review><userid>117633658950874804094< /userid><rate>1< /rate><date>1597807163398<//date><name>Evelyn< /name><gmap_id>0x80c34de07ff735cb:0x93b2fe94274fa9b9</gmap_id>< response>

Went for a pedicure the day before the salons were officially opening back up to public. I had a little bit of a wait, but it was worth it. I went back the following week to have my nails done. I finally felt human again since we all had 2 stay home.< /review>

We texted Tammy that’s supposed to be the one doing my lashes today, and she Said you come at 7:30 and I came all the way  from Moreno Valley to Fontana so I could get my lashes done and when i went in there was a lot of people so I asked her and she was like OK I will get it to you guys right now and then it was 7:43 so I asked her again and she said it’s going to take one hour do you guys want to come tomorrow so I feel like that is so disrespectful because we came from all the way over there to over here for them to cancel an appointment that we already had< /review>

Terrible job! Do not get a pedicure here they over cut the cuticle and couldn't polish my toes right, they kept trying to force me to like the terrible job they had done and got upset when i would point out the polish on my skin.< /Review>

A wonderful modern facility for the local school district's performing arts' programs. The acoustics and seating options are more than adequate. We have been coming here for the past 4 years to hear our children's band performances.</review>

<review>(Translated by Google) Because my son received MALE ATHLETE OF THE YEAR 2017- 2018 AWARD of Anaheim School District and the Ceremony was held there.

About this Facility, Clean, Modern, and it seems like to resound very well.So you can enjoy for conserts, etc.

2019-01-07 Added

The reason for the five-star rating is Orange County, the son of Anaheim School District, which has eight cities in Orange County, and has become one of the top five public schools in the United States. While attending a high school that competes for the evaluation, he won the 2018 Excellent Athlete Award, Male Athlete of the Year 2017-2018, and the award ceremony was held here. Because of the stupid parent.
I put a picture of the shield my son gave me, but it seems to have been rejected. . . . It seems that he wo n’t forgive his fool.

Although I was receiving the strong support of my mother's hard work, I think I did my best well as my son.

Volunteers at Stanford Showcase (≒ Tryout), the top 3 university baseball rankings in the United States, will come to help run the showcase from the universities in the United States, and will count the players who are wearing glasses. This is because baseball boys gather from all over the United States to try out a famous and prestigious university. In fact, the boy who shared his son came from New Jersey on the east coast and made good friends. Since students have a common goal, there seems to be a place where they can communicate with each other with the same topic.
Unfortunately, both of them have no connection with Stanford University and have decided to go to other universities for baseball recommendations. . . .

The son was scouted at the university with a form of striking in the eyes of another university head coach who oversaw the immediate team he belonged to. And I got to go through a scholarship.

The high school I was attending was an overall assessment of grades, etc. According to a certain institution, about 2,200 public high schools in California are top-class assessments, especially high schools that always compete for Number 1 assessments in the state. .
And the name of the league to which the high school baseball club where my son attended was finally changed. The previous "Academy League" Academy League has changed to "605 League". This is the name of the highway 605 "Freeway 605". It ’s a very straightforward name, but it ’s still better than the Academy League.
In a league that has two schools that are constantly competing for Top 1 overall evaluation at a California public high school, it is easy to name it the Academy League, but it may have been a tricky way. The name doesn't seem to be strong yet, so I think it was quite a bad taste for the name of the athletic club.

At my son ’s alma mater, it seems that it was the first time in 8 years to go to college after receiving a recommendation from a university for sports. Moreover, two students got recommendations this time. The other was a girl student and a softball player.

When a new student from a university who entered a college recommended by baseball recommended a teammate's father who came from San Diego asked him about his son's high school, he told him that he was a school belonging to the Sixth Division, and his eyes closed. I confirmed with "From Division 6?" It seemed quite surprised. (Bitter smile)

Incidentally, some powerful schools belong to divisions. My son was scouted by a head coach of a decent power school in a division in the final grade of high school fourth grader, and passed after a tryout. However, he refused the offer after he was worried because of the connection with his teammates who had trouble together. My son's school is not very strong, or it was a very weak school, so it seems that it was very good that he became a regular from the first grade and gained experience in the game. When joining a strong school from the beginning, the regulars may have been strict in Junior Varsity. In fact, my son's friend, a talented player as far as I could see, left the baseball club without being selected as the school's Varsity Team.

If you are not in a hurry
Try searching for a place called Home Run Park. I'm sincerely looking forward to seeing the success of my son, Hachikoku Rokugo, in the video section. It ’s a pretty good hitter and a hard hitter.

This is the only idiot that is too unsightly. (Bitter smile)

If you return the story to this place, the sound seems to be good in a beautiful modern building.

2019-01-07 追記

5つ星の評価の理由は、息子がAnaheim School Districtと言うOrange County、オレンジ郡の8つの市を有する学校区で、全米の公立学校のTop5にも成った、カリフォルニア州の公立校で常にTop1の評価を競う高校に通いながら、2018年の優秀スポーツ選手賞、Male Athlete of the Year 2017 - 2018を受賞し、その表彰式がここで行われたから。と言う親バカの為。
息子が貰った盾の写真を載せたのだが、掲載は却下された様だ．．．。流石にそこ迄の親バカは許してくれないみたいだ。

母親の頑張りの強力な援護を受けて居たとは言え、我が息子ながら良く頑張ったと思う。

全米の大学野球ランキングTop3のStanford大学のShowcase(≒トライアウト)にはボランティアで全米の大学からコーチ達がショーケースの運営を助けに来て、お眼鏡にかなった選手のスカウンティングを行なう。何故なら、有名有力な名門大学のトライアウトには全米から野球少年が集まるからだ。事実、息子と相部屋になった少年は東海岸のNew Jersey州からやって来て仲の良い友達と成った。共通の目標がある生徒同士だから、話題も合って、相通じるところが有るらしい。
残念ながら二人共Stanford大学とは縁が無く他の大学に野球の推薦で通う事になったが．．．。

息子は所属した急造チームの監督を務めた他の大学のヘッドコーチの目に打撃のフォームが留まってその大学にスカウトされたのだ。そして、奨学金を受けて通う事になった。

通学していた高校は成績等の総合評価で、とある機関に拠ればカリフォルニア州の約2,200校有る公立高校ではトップクラスの評価、特に州に置いては常にNumber 1の評価を競う高校なのだ。
そしてまた、息子が通っていた高校の野球部が所属するリーグ名がようやく変更された。以前の "Academy League"アカデミーリーグから、"605 League"になった。これは、高速道路605 "Freeway 605"が名前の由来だろう。とても安直な名付け方だが、アカデミーリーグよりはまだマシだろう。
カリフォルニア州の公立高校で総合評価のTop 1を常に争う2校が所属しているリーグでは、Academy Leagueと名付けられるのも安易ではあるが、致し方の無い事だったのかも知れない。名前からして既に、強そうな感じがしないので、運動部の名前としては相当に悪趣味だったと思う。

そんな息子の母校では、スポーツで大学から推薦を受けて進学するのは8年振りの出来事だったらしい。しかも、今回は二人の生徒が推薦を得た。もう一人は女生徒でソフトボールの選手だった。

野球の推薦で進学した大学の新入生の入寮の際、サンディエゴからやって来たチームメイトの父親が息子の高校の事を尋ねて来たので六部ディヴィジョンに属している学校だと告げると、目をまん丸にして"From Division 6?"と確認して来た。相当にビックリした様だった。(苦笑)

因みに、やはり、強豪校は一部ディヴィジョンに属す。息子が高校4年生の最終学年に一部ディヴィジョンでそこそこの強豪校のヘッドコーチからスカウトされ、トライアウトを受けて合格した。が、それまで苦楽を共にしたチームメイトとの繋がりも有って悩んだ末にその申し出を断わった。息子の学校は余り強くないと言うか、かなり弱い学校だったので一年生からレギュラーに成れて、試合での経験を積められた事がとても良かった様だ。強豪校に最初から入部したら、Junior Varsity(二軍)でもレギュラーは厳しかったかも知れない。現に息子の友人で私が見た限り才能に溢れていた選手はその学校のVarsity Team (代表チーム) に選ばれずに野球部を退部してしまった。

御用とお急ぎで無い方は
Home Run Park と言う場所を検索してみて下さい。動画の項で息子の八面六臂の活躍をご覧頂けたらと僭越ながら真摯に思います。結構な好打者、強打者ですよ。

余りにも見苦しい親バカはこれぐらいにさせて頂きます。(苦笑)

話をこの場所に戻すと、綺麗なモダンな造りの建物で音の反響も良さそうですよ。< /review><GmapID>0x80dd2c19c238c957:0x8c8ee9f884e28075</GmapID>< Resp>

<review>The parking is easy and safe.  It is very clean and their meat department is excellent as is their liquor department with a wonderful selection of beer, wine, and liquor. I always tell the wonderful clerk that my  son from San Diego will stop by and see me after visiting your beer area " if
he has time" : )<//review>< rating>

<review>This market is disgusting! Have been visiting here all my life and am always appalled when visiting at the sheer neglect and lack of cleanliness. This entire store is deteriorating with no funds going into its general care, cleaning or upkeep. I have called the County health department many times over the years on the unhygienic conditions where food is served, displayed and handled. My photos are just a sample of the state of the place. Went in here day before Memorial Day to purchase their featured brand of hot dogs Boars Head and they had none stocked. It's not the first time this has happened. Is it too much to ask that a store stock well in anticipation of a busy BBQing holiday? No...it's not.< /review>< username>

This is the place for fresh squeezed orange juice.  We got apple and orange juice last week  The apple tasted like red delicious which are not my favorite because there is a slight bitter tone at the end but still good.  The oj, oh so tasty.  Got another quart today it's so good.  They also have beautiful strawberries and the best baked goods.  We were eating strawberries on the way home because we couldn't wait.  Recommend.  Also when I need a specialty item like fresh halibut, this is the place to come.  They do such a great job of providing high end products.</review>

I love this store! Everything is super expensive but the beer cave is really cool and the ready made meals are pretty good too! They make great sandwiches at the deli.</Text>

<text>It’s a nice little gourmet market that’s hidden in the elite part of Redlands. I like these kind of markets.  However, two comments past reviewers mentioned were accurate that I too experienced.

Because it is expensive, I expected the snootiness. What I didn’t expect was the bad driving mannerisms in small parking lot, people don’t bother to look, just shoot out like bats out of hell (they are going to hell for being so mean in life). And mad dog you for staring at them for catching them doing so.

While I didn’t have anyone follow me, but because I’m not a local customer & in their eyes look too much commoner & ethnic, I felt all eyes on me the entire time.  Don’t judge a book by it’s cover, not all folks that look like raga muffins aren’t without means.  We too have money.< /text><GmapID>0x80dcaa0366d33b7f:0x91bdb9c38025eb38<//GmapID><username>Mary A< /username><Date>1623593081905<//Date>< Rating>

<user_name>Robert Zador</user_name><time>1611762427363</time><rating>5</rating><Text>The prices are high but for a grocery store tucked away like a secret like Gerrard's is, you can understand why.

The alcohol fridges are a delight. The bakery and in-store prepared foods are delicious. I couldn't talk about this place enough!

But if you're like me and can only splurge so much on fancy food, this isn't your weekly grocery store place! Come to make your parties and picnics pop.< /Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

Bought some jazz music this week and thought where can I find some good beer to listen to my music with.  For beer lovers, this is THE place.  The selection is out of this world, I asked a worker if I could take some pictures and he said "go ahead, take video if you want."  Super friendly and nice.  Very personable.  So I did take pictures to share just a bit of the "Mega Cave" and the "Cave" - and there is more in front of the caves.  This doesn't even include their wine and liquor selection.  So just imagine; but for beer lovers and jazz lovers there is no better place to find the perfect match to listen to your favorite jazz and have some of the finest beer.  I highly recommend this store just for the beer ALONE - when you walk in it smells so good, whatever they are cooking or making smells like heaven.  But for beer lovers again I say this is THE place.  Take a look.  So much to choose from and discover.< /text>

<review>I always have a great experience when I go to Gerrard's Market. Got some beautiful organic whole chickens - (BOGO!), some good wine and of course, a quick trip to the Beer Cave is always perfect for the weekend. I love Gerrard's!< /review>< name>

Bought products off the shelf and when I got home found out the contents were moldy. Fresh stuff was fine but they have very poor stock rotation. Found moldy bread on shelves.<//Review>

<text>Helpful employees . Excellent meat, turkey, salmon, pork roasts, chicken and lamb. Have been purchasing from this store for 32 years. Great turkeys for holidays. Have birds specially bred with extra turkey. Far superior in flavor and amount you get from bird. Their sign up for their turkeys and prime rib and hams begins in October as so popular.<//text><name>Judy Usik< /name></record>

< Review>
The reason for this 5-star review of Gerrard's is because of Tom (owner/manager). I hadn't known Tom prior to this experience, but he really did something special for me:

On Christmas Eve, I was running around town and had managed to get the gifts that I had planned for everyone in my family, except the See's chocolates for my grandfather. See's was closed, and I went by Gerrard's as a last ditch effort, but assumed they did not sell See's. Tom was there when I walked in, so I asked him if they sell See's, and he confirmed they didn't. However, after showing me the different chocolate options they had, he left and then came back a few minutes later with his own PERSONAL box of See's candy, and offered it to me to give to my grandpa for Christmas. I accepted, and Tom basically saved Christmas. Go Gerrard's!! Thank you so much Tom.</Review>

<Text>They always have a great selection of baked goods and there fresh squeezed OJ is to die for. They now have a coffee and juice bar in the store. I had their pecan sticky buns, it was phenomenal! I also tried the biscuit and gravy, which was all right. But they also had sandwiches that they would grill, baked goods, and breakfast burritos. I'm definitely coming back for one of the breakfast burritos. they have such a good selection of fresh and ready to prepare foods.</Text>< pictures>

Gerrard market is one of the best small hidden gems.  A bit pricey but worth it.  You have to try it for yourself.  Thick cut porterhouse, cowboy steaks and the best tomahawks steaks. Not to mention the huge beef ribs.  Worth it!<//text>

Maybe the last independent grocer around. Great selection of beer, wine, spirits, etc. The store has everything a larger one has. The only thing is their produce section is not as large as others. They have a coffee bar now which seems to be picking up. Very happy to support an independent store like this one.< /Review>

Gerrards Market in Redlands is a well stocked local supermarket. They excel in there meat department where they offer Boars Head meats and a companion fully stocked delicatessen. They also specialize in their liquor department with a well stocked refrigerated room for beers and a great selection of wines both domestic and foreign.<//Text>

This place is great. Meat and cheese selection is huge! Veggies could use some variety but its a small mom and pop. The customer service makes up for it! Always so nice!</Review>

Filled with unexpected flavors and variations of standard grocery foods. We spent 30 minutes wandering the store looking for strange and exotic new treats. Think Trader Joe's but with a hometown feel. Additionally the prices are high.</text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPHICW1rAKuLdGYV0TpN34pJOfh8BY4p7KAOq2U=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOLN1ObmbS9L19I6ScoQ5_t5qxhbEmwObug9R-n=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics>< Response>

<Text>Gerrard's is a hidden gem.  As a family run community grocery store, they really go above and beyond to get hard to find specialty items.  They have a wide selection of sodas, probably the best in the area.  Several specialty cheeses and meats.  Overall a fantastic shopping experience, would recommend to anyone!<//Text>< pictures>

Almost a Safeway in terms of diversity of items stocked, but with much higher quality and customer service.   The beer selection is mind-blowing, with two, large walk-in cooler rooms, and an entire cooler of singles from around the world.  A full hard liquor selection, including premium whiskeys and tequilas, and a nice selection of wines.   Very friendly staff.  A VERY nice place to shop.<//Text>

My favorite place.I save so when  I do go its a luxury not to cook.Today spent 65 just got hot items turkey no flavor, ham dry taste like jelly added and stuffing 1 taste everyone would not eat it.Chicken sausage again no flavor and so dry.Sadley don't think I will go back in awhile😞We
all have bad days and miss that home cook flavor.Very expensive even a cheap can of corn 2.00 hopefully the taste will come back</Text>

<rating>5</rating><text>Great grocery store! Smaller than many others, but they have a good variety. Clean, cozy atmosphere and friendly employees. Fresh produce, meats, etc. Some of the prices on standard items may be a bit more in price than the average someplace else. But the store is convenient, not that crowded, and easy to shop around. Would definitely recommend!
Also, for those that love liquor, beer, and/or wine, they have a great selection.<//text>< pictures>

Gerrards is a hidden gem near North Redlands. My husband got a hot pastrami sandwich and I ordered turkey guac and bacon. Deli style sandwich bread and boars head deli meats. Only paid about $7 bucks each. Service was friendly but a bit slow wouldn't recommend going on your lunch break.</Text>

Gerrards is truly a great local market. The whole place has a neat, small town feel to it and the selection of goods they offer is actually quite impressive. They have most of the normal things you'd find in a larger market plus more, like specialty sodas and meats. The Boarshead meat in particular they sell is delicious! Prices are also reasonable. Highly recommend anyone looking for a different grocery shopping experience consider this place!</text>

I first started shopping here for hard to find beers in their locally famous "Beer Cave" but now I stop by for lunch too. The deli is excellent and it has a wide range of options besides sandwiches. The burritos are really good and so is the fried chicken. It's worth the 5 minute drive off the 10 freeway if you have the time. If you are planning on spending some time in the beer cave either bring a sweater ;)< /review>

Great neighborhood market. Lots of specialty products as well as everyday items. Prices are usually the highest in town for most items, but the convenience and products no one else have keep me coming back. They do have good sales and special buys each week. But be ready to use these items right away or freeze as the best sales are usually close to the Sell By date.< /review>

<text>Honestly.. my first time in there. I actually had a feeling of nostalgia ( good). When I got to the register, I told the clerk it was my first time in the store and then I really liked it, she then asked me if I lived in Redlands? I replied " no, Highland", her demeanor completely changed. Sorry, I am not fortunate enough to live in your town, and yet I still
chose to shop there. Giving a "3 " based solely on the clerks stuck up attitude.  Have a very good day!< /text>< Pictures>

Parking is no problem. Variety of options are great, from regular products to organic and specialty products. Prices are higher than other grocery markets, but it's worth it for the shopping experience. I went there on Sunday afternoon, and there was barely a line. Great saving of my time and it saves me a headache from shopping in the crowd.< /text>

Lots of local love and one of the best beer caves you'll ever come across if you're into craft breweries. Only bummer is slightly higher prices than chain grocers on staple items, but it's hard to beat the service!<//text>< pics>

However, selection, service and cleanliness make this a top choice if you live in the area and need a few things. The two refrigerated beer caves are pretty sweet too. And, the store is a great supporter and promoter of local schools, students and public events in the town.</Review><pics>None</pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< Gmap_id>

I love the Redlands T shirts and caps it offers. Unfortunately there seems to be a price hike  on most items.   Buy 1 get 1 free on uncooked pre packaged meat  uncooked sea food is a good but.. Just be more particular with the  prepackaged buy one get one free already cooked deals. (rice with orange chicken is a  thumbs down) Besides that everything else is good. Gerrard's offer a one of a kind insanely huge international variety of beers. Also you may find many hard to find specialty sodas. They also offer award winning Boar's head soups which includes the ever so scrumptious ,can't get enough of New England Clam chowder. Which by the way is the best clam chowder one can find in the world! (My opinion) Nevertheless Gerrard's is a local town store. They sell local farmers fruits and vegetables. The bakery offers delicious rich danishes muffins, brownies  cookies, cakes to order.  I want to recommend the pineapple upside down danish which is the most addicting to me so far. The staff here are friendly and welcoming. I want to give.my thanks to Gerrard's also for staying open to local residents during the covid 19 epidemic lock down. They quickly placed in sanitizing stations out front and every other safety measure to protect customers and staff. I watched them as an unmovable unflinching force providing for the local citizens of Redlands during a time of uncertainty. They have won my vote , my business,my trust. Closing time is 10pm< /text>

Really nice place with super nice people working there. The deli ladies are so patient and helpful which is refreshing.  The dessert section will make u drool in a big way. Homemade pot pies, fresh baked French bread and berry cobbler were very good. It's the perfect little grocery market.< /text>

It was really pleasant . He also thanked me for my brother's service in the military. Thanks for him being so polite<//text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

Excellent selection of premium candies, fresh muffins, wines and friendly service.  The market is in a nice area , with p loo entry of parking on both sides of the store.  We have been there many times.  They also have tables for people to enjoy sandwiches and hot food from their deli counter.<//review>

This is a quaint little grocery store with a pretty incredible beer fridge. Also great to pick up a lunch. Gerrard's remind me more of a convenient store with great service. I rarely ever have to wait in line unlike other grocery stores so I can get in and get our quickly. I'm a fan!< /Review>

Full service markets are hard to come by. Nice staff, they'll load your heavy bottled water and groceries for you with a smile. Check out their hot food in the back, careful the macaroni n cheese has a little kick to it. Also try one of their orange or Hawaiian muffins, pretty bomb!<//review>

<text>Great little market. It had that charming, small town feel to it. It was even featured in a Super Bowl add because it is so quaint and wonderful. Their beer selection is the best you'll find in the area. Same with the off-brand sodas and novelties.< /text>< resp>

This place has a fantastic selection of beer!! It carries other alcohol as well, but their beer selection is better than BevMo! Staff is sweet and they have lots of treats and bakery items. They are a bit pricey, but other than that, it's a great place to shop.<//Review>

<Text>I love coming here for the awesome beer cave, but their prices on groceries are a bit more than I can afford regularly. Also, I've gotten my ice cream from here twice and both times the ice cream was melted/soft. Their freezers don't really work 100% of the time which is worrisome. However their beer selection and pies/baked goods keep me coming back.</Text>< rate>

All grocery stores should be like this. They have a whole salad bar for quick meals to go, the best mac n cheese and a freaking walk in beer cooler with so many beers to choose from your teeth start to chatter before you can see them all. The service is outstanding and they carry a rad selection of specialty candies and snacks.< /text>

Tucked away in the old neighbourhoods of Redlands. Gerrards market offers a plethora of tasty and uncommon products you won't find anywhere else. So if you have that hard to shop for person on your list. Definitely stop buy and give their selection of goods a gander. Very friendly and helpful staff.</text>

So this place carries a huge selection of craft beer, local made candies, crazy selection of sodas, and they have some of the best cuts of meat you can get around town. I would highly recommend stopping in here and checking them out.</text>

Do NOT get deli food here. We just went to get some chicken and sides, and there were flies everywhere. Also, the chicken was supposed to be hot, but they were keeping it luke warm out in the open, but the woman helping me said it was hot. Chicken was dry, bland, and the Mac n cheese was flavorless. I don't know what happened, but it's almost like the care and attention to detail has left their full service deli. Plus, they have "fried" chicken, meaning it's treated like fried and then baked...which leaves the chicken oily and over cooked.<//text>

Service is very good in the hot food ordering area. Food selection is amazing with strange but good things not found anywhere else. Big drawback is service at the register. When you are not being blatantly ignored checkout personnel typically act like it is a bother to do their very easy job. The young lady in particular ( most employees are older) at the checkout has an attitude is rude and always seems put out to be at work this is whether she is taking inventory or "helping" customers. All in all great place, great selection, back counter service is awesome, checkout service not so much. 🤔<//review>

< Review>
It is a private neighborhood market, not a chain, and unique to Redlands. If you are shopping for staples for your pantry, go somewhere else because choices are not so great and prices are not competitive. But in the department  of alcoholic beverages,  deserts, and rare food items this store is hard to surpass. It has 2 "caves" for wine and beer, offering beverages for all tastes and wallets. They have extensive cheese isle. They offer good variety of high quality fish and meats. They bake their own deserts and have a big deli section. They even have their own  outdoor grill for smoked and grilled deli foods.< /Review>

Today I went to get some more sodas and mentioned what had happened on my previous trip there and the clerk gladly deducted the cost off one of my sodas. I thought that was cool!<//text>< Pictures>

<review>Probably the best grocery store i have ever visited. A great selection of cheese, meats, butter, crackers, and soda. Their prices are low for high quality food. Selections you cant find anywhere near by. Great european selections on a few items<//review>< response>

<text>Awesome little grocery store that covers all of the basics you would need. Prices are a bit higher, but supporting local Redlands is worth it. They have a deli, salad bar, and a decent sized international section. The Beer Cave alone is worth visiting and Mo is always around to keep you up-to-date on the latest craft brew news.</text><Rating>5</Rating>< name>

I've been shopping there for years and have always enjoyed the friendly service, the excellent selection of products, and that "local market" feel. I find it a much more comfortable shopping experience than the big chain stores.< /text>

Went to the deli to order a sandwich and it was like I was bothering the women behind the counter. The service was poor but the sandwich was fairly good. Took way too long to get my order.<//review>

The prices are a little higher, but the convenience is higher too. The best place to buy premium wine and beer in the Redlands area. Always crowded around the holidays. Gerrards, which has been there for decades, is a genuine community market.< /Text>< pics>

Well, I just went to pick up some beer and man was I impressed! It's a myriad with plenty of nice high end and affordable stuff. Went around 3pm on this Thursday and the good amount of customers where really great people. Cashier was an elderly jokester lady that made my experience that much greater. Being from San Bernardino, I've always loved Redlands and this market is a perfect manifestation of the city...Had me thinking of raising my future family here.<//text>

I don't usually go to Gerrard's because it's out of my way, but anytime I'm looking for a beer I can't find anywhere else, I go here. They have a walk in cooler with beers from many different breweries, pretty amazing!< /text>

Rude deli people they are clueless about the sandwiches they offer to make on their menu. Not very handicapped accessible for a place that caters to mostly elderly . BRING A JACKET OR A SWEATER !!< /Text>

Fantastic beer selection, everything else is completely overpriced.  For anything other than beer hit sprouts, trader joes, or anywhere else in town.< /text>

The only thing I can probably complain about is their food bar.  Individual pans are not covered and their food looked dry and unappetizing.< /Review>
