<Text>I just want to say what a wonderful experience my husband and I had yesterday going in to get an Eye exam and new glasses. Our exams went well and the doctors were able to get our new Rx for the lenses and was able to get an Rx for an eye issue my husband has.
The best part was working with Natalie getting our frames picked out, fitting them and making sure our styles and needs were met.
Natalie was friendly, funny, and courteous. Sunday at the Arden location was hectic and with COVID restrictions she managed to get us out the door with 3 pairs of glasses that we couldn’t wait to use.
Thank you Natalie from the slightly pink skinned male with age spots and his honey.

I had a great experience at this Lens Crafters location. They were able to get me an eye appointment day of. My eye exam was helpful and the staff was very knowledgeable. The eye doctor was very kind and explained everything to me that I wanted to know.

The staff up front helped me immediately after the exam and I was able to find a new pair of frames. The lenses and frames were ready within an hour to pickup even though it was a really busy day.

I appreciated all the help. Everyone provided exceptional service.</Review>

I will never go with you again, I paid for the exam and the results weren't good I couldn't see, and I told you the same day, and you fixed only my contact prescription and not my lenses and after a year I came to do my glasses and you want me to pay all over again for exam after I already paid and notified you that the prescription was no good to my eyes!! Never go again with you!! Spend my money for nothing< /Review>

<text>Only giving a 2 star due to the fact that my optometrist, Nicholas, was amazing. Explained what was being done, answered my questions and concerns.. this was our first time here. After geting the drops for my eyes to be dilated, we were handed over to an associate to be taken care of until the doctor was free and my eyes were dilated.. she instructed us to browse around the frames and try them on. She asked if it was our first time there in which we replied "yes, this was our first".and was left alone to browse as she went to input our information in the system.. Later while we tried on some frames, we decided to put back a couple of frames we were no longer interested in and an associate, Natalie, instead of coming over and quietly informing us to "not put the frames back because they have to be sanitized first", instead, yelled across the room in front of all of the other customers and associates.. not only was that absolutely disrespectful and uncalled for, not one associate told us the whole time we were browsing, and trying on multiple frames, to not put them away or to just set them on counter until this incident... she is very unprofessional and she is very  rude.<//text><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>{'time': 1612803353076, 'text': 'Thank you for your review.

Limited inventory which is fine but the female staff here are rude and unhelpful.

Scheduled my yearly LensCrafters appointment at this new location during COVID-19, and don’t think I’ll be returning. They’re doing a great job of maintaining social distance, cleaning frames, wearing masks. However today’s visit left me with $300 less in my bank account and no clear date on when I will actually receive my glasses. They did however though charge me full price on a new pair of Ralph Lauren Polo frames and then tried to slip the used ones; all the customers have been trying on in the store, into the new case. When I asked for a new pair of frames the lab technician said who knows when that will be maybe 3 to 6 months from now. Then he told me LensCrafters has been selling us customers these used frames when in stock at full price for a while now. Now that you all know this before you leave please check your glasses for dents, scratches, and color deterioration. We work so hard for our money and we expect if you charge us full price you’re not trying to cut corners. Especially when we’re already paying markup for name brands made by Luxotica who owns LensCrafters; fun fact.<//text>

I have pretty much purchased all my glasses from LensCrafters for the last 20 years or so. I went in to look at glasses and exam I haven't been out for ever cause of COVID. I asked if they are doing exams she said the 24th okay. But I heard her say to another after me she could get in earl 15 th. Thank you for letting me know you don't need my business. I was counting my old glasses over 15 pairs of glasses from LensCrafters.</Text>

< Review>
I called this store twice today. The first time I called the lady had the audacity to hang up on me when I asked a question regarding my insurance. I called back and a different lady picked up. She was very rude and sounded very impatient. We were talking about my insurance and she tells me blue shield doesn’t have vision insurance, which is impossible because I am currently paying for vision insurance from blue shield and I’ve had family use their blue shield insurance AT LENSCRAFTERS to purchase their glasses, making it seem like she doesn’t want to help me. She hastily takes my information and says she’ll call me back and never does. I’m highly dissatisfied with the customer service I received today. Management needs to work on training their workers for a better customer service. Is this how LensCrafters allow their workers to treat their customers? Very unprofessional and disappointing.</Review>

I have gotten 6 pair of glasses here over the last several years. I would like to say I have always been treated well. Fast forward to this week. I got a new pair last month,the same style as last year. I wanted a greyish tint to compliment the bluish ones from last year. I had to order the frames ,anyway the glasses came in early. I had to have the tint lightened as they were to dark, done same day, great,now they were to light, done next day. I can,t say enough GOOD THINGS about this bussiness & its associates< /text>

Get your prescription and get out of there. Their sales people all they care about is selling glasses that are not healhy for your eye sight. MY GF now has glasses that are not healthy for her eyes and  she not warned about it. The white lady at the counter just cared about selling extra charges on the glasses that were not neccessary and not what was needed for the eyes. Scam</review>< pictures>

I got a recorded voice mail offering a free eye exam, called back to confirm the appointment and that there would be no charge, and when I showed up I was told there would be a charge of $75. I explained the phone calls and the tech asked the manager who said there was nothing they could do for me other than charge me for the exam. It was a waste of my time and there was a very disappointing lack of explanation about why I was misled.< /review>

Doctors are way to overbooked. Waited 2 weeks for an appointment. Not a problem. Waited over 40 minutes at that apptointment that took less than 2 minutes. Also, they wrote down the WRONG contact lense prescription. So upset, i wont even go back to have them correct it. Disappointed in this location. Also, at first visit they quoted $45 copay for contact lense fitting. Cost $75 at the end with insurance. Had nothing extra done (not even dilation). My kids had exams at eyeglass world, copay $10.< /text>

Absolute disgrace! I went in here a month and a half ago and had an eye exam and ordered contacts. All was well then. I havent recieved my contacts yet and then when I call in to ask about it they put me on hold for 30 minutes. So I hung up and called back and someone new answered and she told me she was too busy to deal with my problems. Ridiculous way to treat a customer and I will not be returning.</review>

The staff had an apathetic attitude. Even the doctor was late for work. Instead of telling me upfront that their machinery was broken, they waited until the exam was over, and I was about to pay my bill. I asked if they could e-mail the order to another store, and have them FedEx the glasses to Arden Fair. That way I could come back the next day. I was told that I could do the leg-work myself, and go to another store, or I could wait 10 to 14 business days for them to outsource the lenses. This is a far cry from the old company culture of "glasses in about an hour."<//text>

Great Sales Staff
2nd pair of transition frames and Rx lenses at LensCrafters. I had an excellent customer experience in this same store over a year ago. I walked in having somewhat of an idea what I wanted and was greeted by the excellent Rachel. She helped and guided me thru most of the buying experience. I opted to get a new Rx at that time which was of course, more money. The Eye Doctor, herself, was warm and explained everything to me. Glasses are pricey and you're going to spend good money even if you are trying to scrimp. Great service and knowledgeable cross trained staff.</Text>

THE LADY MESSED UP MY ORDER BY PUTTING IN A 10 DAY PRESCRIPTION!!!!  After clearly she confirmed my request for the 1 hour service. Totally wasted my time!!  We went back because I never received a call.  She realized the mistake.  By that time the lab was closed!!!  I was furious. Then told me it will be done by 9am latest 1pm.  When I checked hours of operation for Sunday. .opens at 11:00.  If I could give no star. I would. FRUSTRATING. COST ME A DAY OF WORK.< /review>

<review>I made a reservation several weeks in advance to pick up a rental car on Monday May 30, 2016. The day before I was scheduled to pick up my car, somebody from Hertz called me to inform me this location would be closed for the holiday, and I would need to go to the Hertz at the San Diego Airport to pick up my car, and then return it to the airport location at the end of my rental. I was told that I would be reimbursed for taxi fare. If the location at 333 W Harbor Dr was closed for the holiday, they should not have accepted a reservation online.

I specifically made my reservation for this location because it is within walking distance to my hotel. I had to pay for taxi service to and from the airport location. After talking to three managers and showing my taxi receipt, I was reimbursed $15 for my full taxi fare. The manager tried to originally only reimburse $5.00, even though I had a receipt for more. The manager would not give me money for a taxi ride back to the hotel.

I contacted Hertz Customer Service after my trip, and they reimbursed my taxi ride back to the hotel and offered a voucher towards a future rental. Unfortunately, the voucher expired two weeks after it arrived.

I was very disappointed with Hertz Car Rental and would not recommend this company.<//review>< user_name>

Reserved a car in advance and when we arrived at the Marriott (after waiting 30 minutes in the Hertz line) we were informed they didn't have any cars available for us and one would be available in 5 hours.  Why would you take and confirm my reservation if this was the case?   Book with ACE instead,  better rate and better service.</Review>

Had a minor hiccup where I arrived late 45 minutes late for my reservation and the car I had rented was gone, leaving only a Toyota Yaris. As someone that is 6’5”, this presents a problem. Cliff, the employee on staff, was sympathetic and helped me out in getting a larger vehicle, at a better rate. He was very professional and humorous the entire interaction.</text>

<Text>Terrible! We pre paid for 15 days up front. When we arrived from Florida Hertz said we owed taxes and a deposit . So we played with a credit card but needed to use a Debit card for the balance.  Well they don't accept debit and it was not disclosed to us about this.  They would not release any car to us. We lost a day of our rental and had to pay more money for outside travel arrangements.  They really need to disclose this before you get here that they have STRINGENT RULES FOR DEBIT CARDS<//Text>< Resp>

<review>Car not cleaned. Prior renters paperwork, coffee cup and used Kleenex still in the car.  Misinformed me of cost to drop off at airport. Charged $40 for doing so.

Calls to Hertz customer service to complain on both topics had long hold times. Was hung up on and had to call back.  Hertz unwilling to waive any fees. Paid for a dirty car. 20+ year Gold Member.<//review>< pics>

I had trouble with my reservation when I arrived in the early evening, Thanksgiving Day, and was given a sub compact car (all that was left) even though I had wanted a mid-size car.  I came back the next day and the manager, Brandon, got me into a Nissan Altima at a charge consistent with the original reservation and gave me a $75 credit for the overcharged on the sub compact. Everything was done with courtesy and efficiency. Thank you Brandon and all the staff at Hertz in San Diego.<//text>

They were very friendly but also pushy about the extra insurance and gas add on. I understand up-selling but I dislike being offered these items when I did not ask for them. Also, I thought it was odd that, as a walk in, I was only allowed a compact car as an option.I would've opted for something bigger but wasn't given the choice and was told that 'we're fully booked'. Oddly, the lot was FULL.<//Review>

I rent from this Hertz location regularly.  It is my favorite agency in San Diego. I recommend checking into Travelocity or other 3rd party for a discounted rate. Hertz website is often the most expensive way to book it.<//Text>

Car wasn't clean (documents were in the car from a previous rental), tank wasn't full and told I didn't need to refuel. Returned with the same amount of gas but got charged 138$ for Hyundai Sonata full tank. Contacted support and got nothing so far. 5-star member.</Review>

The county staff is very friendly.
If you're looking to rent a Hertz rental car in San Diego, be sure to do it here. Highly recommended.

반납은 호텔 발렛 직원에게 허츠 반납한다고 하면 됩니다.
카운테 직원 엄청 친절합니다.
샌디에고에서 허츠 렌트카 대여 하실일 있으면 여기서 꼭 하세요. 강추합니다.</text></record></dataset><record>

I love coming here and getting dinner when I don't have the time to cook. Always tastes great and they let you use a coupon for each pizza and they don't check the expiration date ever now that's class!<//text>

<Review>the last time we tried to visit, I called and asked what time they closed, they gave me a time, we were there 5 minutes before that time, and they flipped the CLOSED sign in my face and wouldn't serve me. This time I ordered by phone, got a discount code online, they didn't make the pizza  I asked for and they wouldn't give me the discount coupon I got online for "In store".  At least they could have said, we can give you a senior discount.. I don't like this place, and am seriously thinking about going to a different Papa's...<//Review><gmapID>0x809053d51f2aa2db:0x5f429041c0d59935< /gmapID><Time>1611797156433</Time><pics>None<//pics><userid>103857158141606774739< /userid>< response>

The cowboy is my all-time favorite can never go wrong with this one as far as I'm concerned. I also had the chicken and artichoke which was equally delicious. They put plenty of toppings so you don't feel like your pizzas ever naked.</Text>

It's still very new so they're still working out some of the kinks BUT staff is super friendly and willing to help out whenever and where ever. You have to make a reservation like two weeks in advance at this point since it is the only Bud and Bloom at this time. The elote street corn was delicious but the chicken wings weren't great. This is a must see place if you can make the time!<//review></record>

<review>I have never seen a more beautifully designed Cannabis store. It has a modern industrial look that will just blow your mind. I came in looking specifically looking for a Heavy Hitters cartridge and was once again blown away by their display that had for them. I left a happy customer and will continue to come back here all the time.< /review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOGCg7KWZ3bWNR6argMcCZTMDjVTpjKG5Wu-45q=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures>< response>

Today they unfortunately lost my business forever as they refused to serve me my pick-up order because I did not have a mask on. I was willing to wait outside like a second class citizen but that wasn't enough for them. Went to People's down the street instead and they were happy to take my money and treated me like a regular customer. Nothing personal on the staff and I'm sure they have great product at great rates. I vote with my wallet.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< gmap_id>

I had an amazing experience here. Everyone is very friendly and helpful. In particular the associate Gina. She helped me find and buy exactly the type of bud I wanted. Any questions I had she answered quickly and thoroughly. I highly recommend Bud and Bloom for anyone searching for a dispensary.< /Review>

<review>First time coming to this shop and I loved my wonderful experience. Lovely young lady named Jasmine welcomed me with a big smile and didn’t mind that I had a lot of questions. She helped me get all the things I was looking for and answered all my questions happily and now I know way more than before. Just moved to CA and can’t wait to be back to this shop again.

Bud and Bloom has just the right mix for the savvy sativa shopper! Clean operation, but not clinical. Helpful, knowledgeable staff, and the ample stock is well placed for your casual perusal. Discounts for oldsters, military, and maybe some other groups. But check first for your discount days. Support your local and legal marijuana shop. You won't go wrong here. Aidee helped me today and did she put a smile on my face? Oh yeah!< /Text>

A great "next gen" dispensary where customers can actually have an excellent shopping experience.  The (packaged) products are on shelves which can be accessed so that you can read the ingredients before deciding on placing into your basket.  The product selection is excellent and the staff is super friendly.<//review>

My last review did not actually post so here it is...

This place is the absolute best example of great customer service. All the employees have been super knowledgeable as well as friendly and approachable. They have been able to answer questions and also give great insight as well as great recommendations. Pricing is competitive but they do have deals during the week. Most importantly, they include tax in all pricing online so you know exactly what you need.

Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a easy transition into the recreational or medicinal cannabis world</Review>

<Text>This spot is rad. Key points: quality customer service, knowledgeable staff able and ready to assist, great product variety including pre packaged flowers, pax era pods, tinctures, and gummies. Check their daily deals out to save some change on return visits :)

Update: They do deliveries now! Rad service, they found the apartment in a timely fashion. The driver, Casey, arrived with a smile and went over the order, and brought me some str8 fire. Ty Bud and Bloom, you guys are epic👏🙏 Will be ordering again and again.<//Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNpfOZuCg6Ye_phBQRH1qQylaCD0YCktwa-FWpn=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOSQz8qp6rIERsFuJyHY3CRAsNbNkFx3jLNoJew=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics>< Resp>

I went in about 2 weeks ago. Very nice place I have been going for a while anyway long stoty short a young security guard Cris I believe he said his name was started be rude to customers outside as we wait. So I bought my product and went home and call a store manager was told he would handle the problem. Boy did he shore fix the problem. Went in today not thinking anything about it. Was talk I was not welcome there and I dont understand why. So I would just say to anyone there are so many other clubs just go somewhere else<//review>

I went in for my first time, referred by my best friend who raves about this place. I thought I would be getting 20% off cause that’s what I was told at the front, for it being my first time, I even got a red ticket that I handed to the bud tender at check out. after leaving out the pack of joints that I specifically asked her opinion about getting, I asked the budtender if she remembered to ring up the joints because I didn’t see them there. She said she didn’t and said that she would just do it separately because she had already started ringing up the order that was over $200. Funny that when I got home the only receipt that shows a 20% discount is the second one for a measly $30 pack of joints. A $7 discount as opposed to a $40 one. When I called to ask about how this happened and what we could do about it the guy on the phone first accused me of not giving her the red ticket, then proceeded to be the rudest and told me to come back to the store or they couldn’t do anything. When I mentioned that I was FORTY FIVE minutes away, making it a round trip of an hour and a half of driving to fix THEIR mistake, he just said to come back. Would you be paying for my gas, too? Ha! No. I’m leaving back home to Washington tomorrow so there’s really nothing I can do, just wanted to let you know so that you don’t do this again. I’ve been hearing about your club from Melanie for years and after this, I won’t be returning again.< /text>

This shop is pretty unique and carries "purely" CBD products!  The management is very knowledgeable and friendly.  Lazarus Naturals is a great Oregon-based brand that has their products available here for very good prices.   Check it out!<//Text>

<Rate>5</Rate><review>Bud & Bloom is my first choice when it comes to purchasing Cannabis. The Staff are friendly, knowledgeable, sober and so helpful. I love their weekly specials and pricing. It definitely helps with the absurd state tax. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe they work that hefty 15% excise tax into the items price tag. So when you go to pay for your items, you are not thrown back by the final cost. The store is clean, open, and very calming which is a plus. It doesn't feel like you are walking into a rave or house party, but an actual civilized establishment. With their natural rustic look, I can definitely see them being parked next to a Whole Foods or inside a shopping mall in the future.<//review><Name>Peter Ayala</Name><Pics>None< /Pics>< Time>

<Text>A close friend who lives in Riverside recommended Bud and Bloom without hesitation. "It's the best in Orange County!" He was right. From the moment we walked-in - friendly, caring, passionate professionals did everything they could to make sure we felt comfortable and well attended to. Special shout-outs to Esmeralda who greeted and gave us the rundown and Alex who went above and beyond by sharing his knowledge and passion for his craft. Thanks all, we'll be back!</Text>< Pictures>

< Review>
This place is the unbelievable. The actual place is clean, feels inviting, is very organized. Now the people are GREAT, I have no experience with any of this kind of stuff, I have never even lit a lighter in my entire life. Now because of my health I need to start learning more about this stuff. So the people that work here are so patient, they take their time in learning about what and why you need, even what you are willing or not to do. They are very knowledgeable about flowers, edibles and tincture. Today Marlo took so much time and patients with me to learn and HEAR what I needed and why then he just took control and gave me different choices. I never felt rushed or pushed into an item. In fact what I had picked out 90% of the items he put back on shelves and showed me better items with more effect. Marlo you are really great. Also for those wondering, most things are out in the open, you can touch and read labels etc. Unlike most places where everything is under glass and you wait in one line to be helped. This place is completely different.</Review>

< review>
I've gone through the whole legalization process: from meeting a stranger at a gas station in the middle of the night, to shady medicinal facilities, to shadier rec facilities, to short-lived cooperatives. I'm done looking around. The Bud and Bloom is a clean and professional establishment and I appreciate their attention to detail in both design and demeanor. I especially love that they're giving a new face to cannabis by extending a service to the elderly, so that they can experience the plant as they see fit. They also host certification classes and support groups at their facility.<//review>

I speak of a modern and Bio-Natural Agriculture to recover the fertility of the land.

I can tell you that our product is not recycled like others, but it is virgin, completely virgin, since we collect them from a chain of more than 3000 special places and we always give it in a perfect Mixture of two types of Bio Fertilizers of different species .
With 20 years of experience in the investigation, and application of the product and having the methods we know that your Crops will obtain an incomparable high Biological Quality and your production will be better than with other products.

<review>Today was my second visit to this dispensary. I can’t say enough good things about my visit. The staff was amazing, informative, and very friendly. I came and bought a few items and someone who I guess was the manager came in and apologized for me having to wait and gave me a discount for my troubles when really it was no trouble at all.  I have been to a lot of dispensaries and it’s nice that I can come to a place that is so professional.  I feel like I need to take a shower after coming to most dispensaries nowadays because I walk in and it’s almost like a nightclub.  Music so loud you can’t hear the barely legal person working behind the counter giving no accurate product knowledge for people who actually use this medicinally like me.  I don’t want all the extra.  And because of that I will only be coming to Bud and Bloom for now on and nowhere else.  It’s about a 25 minute drive for me, but I don’t care.  Best place I’ve been to since moving to California!<//review>< Pictures>

<rating>1<//rating><Text>I use CBD tincture for sleep. I first heard of this business while looking for a product called Drift Away. I found it online at Bud and Bloom and placed the order. A while later I received a text message telling me the order was ready for pick up. I drove from Covina to Santa Ana to pick up the order. When I arrived I was informed that they didn’t have the product. It was explained to me that I had ordered from a third party (Weedmaps) who had no knowledge of their inventory. They did however have a product called Sleepy Time that works very well. I was told going forward to order either from their website or to call the order in prior to pick up. Yesterday I went to their webpage. It’s a very nice but useless website. No way to check inventory or to place an order. I then called and the recording stated to press two to place an order. The recording said that the person I was trying to reach was unavailable. I pressed “0” and was told to hold for the operator. A few seconds later I heard “the person you are trying to reach is unavailable”. I tried calling back several times but kept getting the same message. I decided to drive there and pick it buy it. Due to traffic it took me an hour. After arriving I was told they were out of stock on that item. Before leaving their parking lot, I searched for the product from my phone and, thankfully, found the product was carried by a store a mile away called OC3. I drove to that store and was able to get what I wanted. It baffles me how a business can have such a weak website and phone system and expect to survive. From now on, I will order from stores online and have the product delivered.</Text><pictures>None</pictures><response>{'time': 1577732574216, 'text': "Hello Roger, we're so sorry you had this experience.

Amazing staff and atmosphere. It's a very nicely decorated shop where it feels good to be. Everyone is very nice and professional (their security guy is hilarious!).
They have a lot of choice (strains, edibles, cosmetics...) , good deals, reasonable prices and very good quality weed! Plus, it's the only dispensary where the staff let me come as a guess with my husband without a US ID. Big thank you for that guys!</Text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Text>B&B is my wife and my favorite dispensary. When it became legal to use cannabis at the beginning of the year, we went on a tour of the dispensaries in the Santa Ana area. The feel inside of B&B is a cross between a dispensary and an Anthropology with the flooring, the decor and the soft lighting. The staff is top notch with their knowledge, their professionalism and their friendly attitude. I had a vape cartridge go bad without being usable and when I brought out to their attention, they rectified it quickly and painlessly. The selection of products are carefully curated with quality above anything else. Longer story short, there are other good dispensaries in the area but there is a reason my wife and I only go to B&B after visiting the rest.<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>{'time': 1530034068225, 'text': "This makes my day, we love the two of you!!

I initially went here with some friends while in town but was blown away at the care and attention I received in asking questions about my medical needs. The person who helped me was knowledgeable,  kind, listened intently and found me products I haven't tried and made me feel welcome. I really couldn't have asked for a better experience. Bonus: the store is gorgeous and the breadth of products available is extensive.</Text>

Good quality. Shop is very nice. Pricey just like all dispensaries.
Edit: After browsing other dispensaries, your prices are cheaper than most others that I have been to since. Specially since I mainly buy oil cartridges.<//text>

Always a quick and pleasant experience at bud and bloom with the best pricing in town when it comes to raw garden even with the recent price increase! The discounts on Wednesdays and Saturdays for concentrates are 20% which is unmatched in OC. My only issue so far has been that they seem to run out of stock really quick and it takes them 3-4 days to restock I don't understand why they don't order more as soon as they get to the halfway point in their stock so they are never out.< /review>

What an absolutely gorgeous shop, with a killer staff and reasonable prices on everything. Everyone is polite, professional and hilarious, and the product selection is enough to make your eyes tear up. There were so many things to look at, I spent twenty minutes just walking around drooling. Go. Go right now. Stop reading and just go. You'll walk out feeling like a kid again.<//review>

We would typically exchange the cartridge in this instance to make sure you feel comfortable with your purchase.\n\nThe bubble in the cartridge is typically just due to the cartridge being slightly bigger than needed and not the company shorting the oil in the cartridge. These are filled to an exact weight measurement by each company yet sometimes their cartridges are larger than they needed and it looks emptier than it should be.\n\nI hope this was able to clear up some of the confusion regarding the bubble and I will work with our team to make sure this clear to everyone.\n\nThank you for your feedback!"}< /Resp>< Pics>

I went yesterday to buy a cartridge.when i opened it there was a large bubble in it which means i got cheated and dont have a full cartridge. I called and told the guy exactly that then he comes with well i stopped using that brand because i took a hit and a small bubble came after about 5 hits. That's a BS switching what i told him game to discredit what i said about the cartridge. The employee insinuated that im lieing about the large bubble. I repeated to him again i told you when i opened it;it had a bubble before i took a hit. He said well then you can bring it in and tell them&see what they say. I wouldnt recommend this place they obviously knew its a problem with the brand&they still selling it. I wish i had checked before i left. Their cartridges are way more expensive than the other dispensaries i go to&the employee made it seemed like i 1st smoked it then saw a bubble in it to cover up me getting ripped off so for me i wont return or recommend them to anyone.< /Review>

Cashier forgot my gummies. They wouldn't do anything to help me. When I did ask the manager Jared was absolutely rude to me. I'm here for medical don't be rude to people who are on a fixed income and support your store. Not anymore. Never again. No real help.
Menu was...wrong
ATM it says online... Wrong
Accept credit cards... Wrong

Why lie?? people are in pain and come in for help??<//review>

<review>Used to be great. I would commute 30 minutes just to go here but now I’m bummed out. Ever since weed went legal, I’ve watched this place just plummet in quality over my last three visits. Most of the people who worked there seem to be gone. Now when I ask questions about the strains I literally get “uhhhh” in response followed by them reading labels and saying more or less “I guess this works”. My favorite strains have been sold out every time I go and I can’t get a solid answer on whether they’re just sold out or if they’ve retired the strains.
If you have specific needs you really have to push them to offer you appropriate strains and kind of hold their hand through the whole process. Before I would get as far as “I use this to treat anxiety” before they’d interrupt with a bunch of recommendations and information on the different options.

Now they haven’t a clue even when I’m telling them literally what I need based on previous workers advice. I was told today they’re phasing our weighed flower in jars to pre weighed packages and they’ve moved everything behind the counter so shopping around isn’t as efficient. I imagine this could be a side effect of legalization which sure, I get it. But it would be easier to deal with if when I asked for what I needed without being able to look at it myself, they’d actually be able to help me and talk to me about it :(

Really the whole thing is a sad mess and I won’t be coming back.</review>< user>

Not impressed at all. Very nice staff and location. However, they have very little selection and extremely high prices. Stars are for the staff. They saved this place from a 1 star rating.

EDIT 11/18/18;
Still way too expensive on cannabis products. They snuck some cheap pipes and things in the store. They only have one price point on flower. Top shelf prices. Unless you are looking to pay 40+ for 3.5 grams. This place is still too expensive. If you don't have a compassionate shelf or prices for mmj patients, seniors, vets, disabled, people on fixed incomes. You are doing this for the wrong reasons. $$$ It Is disappointing since it seems as though this place may be hooked up with OC NORML.

Again. I dont review "businesses." I review skills, habits, and attitudes. If the management cared they would add some products with a lower price point. Not just throw some cheap pipes out and invite me back in.< /Text>

Never have inventory of the items they sell, but they can put you on a "call" list when it comes in but FAIL to call. Even when you call ahead to make sure they have what it is you want they lie and say they do and in the 10 mins it takes to get there they sell completely out.

Save yourself the frustration and crappy service and go somewhere else!!< /Review>< gmap_id>

<Text>Oh man. I wish I could say great things.  Ok, here's one:  my bud tender was great. She was patient, friendly and knowledgeable.

Now for the bad:  I'm new to California and medical marijuana. I saw a great right up on Yelp about them, and saw a pic of daily specials. One of which was 20% off for disabled, seniors, and vets. There were also pics of LOADS of different strains inc. some dark purple buds that I wanted to check out, so I went there today.

I'm told that those specials no longer exist. Bummer, they should clear out old pics but ok. They told me my medical marijuana card would get me 10% off.  Better than nothing. Then I'm told they don't have the weed that was in the pics.  Huh??  Finally after looking through the nice, but small, selection I picked out a few items.

The last straw was when they said my card wasn't good for the discount b/c the doctor's name wasn't on it. They wanted the Paper, not the Card which I haven't run into at any other dispensary.
No sale.  Walked out, went someplace else.< /Text><username>Steven Rowe<//username><Rate>1<//Rate>< pictures>

< Review>
few things
1. I went at 830 and was told they would not allow any new patients in after 830, this should be stated in the "special hours" as I went completely out of my way to go here and would NOT have had they had the proper instruction
2. As I picked my first selection I noticed that the batch was small piecey bits and stemy to high hell.... I as a bud tender would have asked if I could recommend one of better quality (especially at 45 an 1/8) but it wasn't until I mentioned how crappy the quality was did she recommend a new one.
3. Service was slow, was there about 15 mins after I signed papers waiting to be tended.
4. Over priced for what I got.

That is my experience and I will not be returning {{the tenders were nice everyone was friendly I just personally felt like it was a bad experience}}</Review>

I didn't like this place at all. They are more interested in high profits and have no discounts for senior citizens or medical patients..Their prices are fifteen to twenty dollars higher then other  dispenceries in the

Nice campus and beautiful views, but make sure you know where to park before going. Went to the visitor center specifically for the purpose of asking where to park. 3 minutes later I go back to my car to see the parking patrol putting a ticket on my car. I told him my story and was in process of moving to the right lot, but I was still cited.<//Text>

<Text>Make sure to call well before your visit to set up a tour. I toured with 23 students and they accomodated us nicely. They have open tours on a daily basis that you can sign up for. The tour guides are enthusiastic and well-informed students.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><gmapID>0x80e93f6ff9591c55:0x38c217bae08e6bc1< /gmapID></record>

Santa Barbara is hella nice. Army ROTC and ASL and many majors and clubs that will appeal to all student types. Bike and skateboard lanes for those sporty students out there as well as a big wide beach view in the backyard<//Review>

<review>Today is Wednesday 2:50 PM and in shows on my phone it should be open but is not? You walk to the door and it has hours for fall? A paper posted on the door that reads, fall hours for Wednesday we open at 4. Yes for fall not spring nor summer get it fix you guy's. Other then that, the place is descent really no big whoop, is near by where we live. The machine that pitches 40 MPH throws a few balls really high or really low so you only get maybe 60% of pitches down the middle. Take it for what it is a place to take a few swings and just practice.< /review></record>

I've been here twice and had a blast both times. The place filled up around 12:30am. The crowd was a bit on the older side, which is fine, and I'm not sure how to judge this, but they seemed more.. mature.. it seemed like they've been out dancing a lot. Good moves!

We never had to wait long at the bar. There was no wait outside. Lots of space towards to back of the dance floor, and lots of energy towards the front. Perfect!

The stage area feels a little cramped though. Perhaps because there's an enormous pillar in the middle of the dance floor.

I'll definitely be back.< /Review>

This is a very multifaceted joint. I've been here for tech events and night life. It has a nice wood interior design with a good sized dance floor.

I've enjoyed my time at this place for the nigh life and for the tech events. I will have to say I've been here more for the tech than the night life. Not much else to do around the area if you come out here at night.

Check out the event calendar and stop by one night.<//Text>

Liked the art on the walls. The location of the club is quite off of downtown, so no trouble finding parking, but still thought it was a creepy area to go to.< /Text>< Pictures>

This is my favorite club in SF. It's so small and has an amazing sound system. Best place to see a DJ before they get too big for the small clubs. Always have a good time here!< /Text>

Mighty was one of my favorite clubs in town. The sound system is top notch, the DJ's that are booked are always amazing and the crowd that comes here is a ton of fun. I would say this is in my top 3 favorite places to go. I will miss it :(< /review>

<review>Nice club with great sound when they have a decent sound engineer. The sound equipment comes from the old Townsend club which is way more then enough sound for a club the size of Mighty. Definitely worth checking out if there is a DJ you want to see.< /review>< time>

< Review>
Mighty is an open spaced club with one main room on a street off the beaten way.  Taxis don't typically drive by here, so we took an Uber car to and from the location.  The area looks a little more industrial with a brick building front and not much else around.  We went here back in January to see DJ Jazzy Jeff and some other artists.  The venue was set up so the deejays were on a higher stage than the rest of the room, which helps if you go here for a show.  There is a little outside area which is cordoned off on the sidewalk so you can get some fresh air.  The club was pretty packed that night, so it was hot inside.  They also have a good sound system, so bring your earplugs if you're looking out for your ears!< /Review>

Big clean bathrooms a slamming dance floor and good staff? And DJ's who don't mind if you play a tambourine to their beats? Yes please thank you.< /Review>

Not that I dont love bass, but it just needs to be balanced with some highs. I have seen some good dj's and artisits perform here and always had a good time.

Usually attend the SFTech events that Myles hosts. Great place to go get a drink, convres with other entrepreneurs, and investors. There are demos/pitches. One can also pitch on stage for cofounders/employment opportunities.< /Review>

<time>1412635093554</time><Rating>4<//Rating><text>love mighty!  it's probably my favorite music venue in the city for the following reasons:

1)  easy parking:  lots of parking on the street.
2)  great sound system:  listening to miguel migs and julius papp spinning was unreal.
3)  bars / drinks:  2 large bars and friendly bartenders.
4)  reasonable cover:  around $10 person if you purchase advance online.
5)  diverse crowd:  from dressy to casual, i feel like you can be whatever you want here at mighty.  not pretentious at all.  just full of people that want to have a good time.
6)  food:  oh yeah, there's a "me so hungry" food truck right outside.  too thoughtful.

will definitely visit again for some good beats!<//text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

<Review>Really good spot specially for house music. This place is huge and they have made very good use of the space. It is definitley a warehouse converted into a club.

When we walked it was a $20 cover on a thursday night , there was not a big line to get in though. The DJ is the elevated level on the main dance floor. They play the video alonh with the and they also project it on the wall which is cool. DJ was definitely kickass and he played a lot of house from 80's and early 90's.

The crowd was diverse right from young college kids to people in thier late fifties. My only complaint is that thier drinks are not very strong otherwise this is a dope spot for house music!</Review>< username>

<text>All I needed was a shift cable for a Honda!! It has been in their shop for 3 1/2 weeks. I have called consistently, to be told the part has been ordered, then not ordered, canceled and so forth. I was contacted 1 time by the girl up front, that’s it. No one ever called me back like she said. My car was never ready or anything, every time she said it would. I can’t even begin to tell you how this has put my life in a mess. I lost my job because I don’t have a car, my kid has missed school, I even told them that and I still have no idea what is happening to my car. I will never come here again. I just don’t understand why?< /text><pics>None< /pics>< response>

John has come highly recommended numerous times. I could not have had a better experience with John and his team. Honest, upfront, good pricing. Instead of trying to sell an unnecessary fix, he tells you what is and is not urgent. Recommended to everyone!< /review>

No hidden fees. I needed 4 tires mounted and they did the job in under 30 minutes and no hidden fees. $28 per tire out the door. Plus I liked how I can just wait in the lobby. Too many places with the social distancing bs.<//review>

<rating>5< /rating><review>John and his crew are the very, very best. Honest, quick, and flexible. Willing to explain things, give you options, and do great work. I found Ka-Pa years ago when a tow driver recommended him and I lived nearby. I’ve moved far across the city since, but getting the good deals, great work, and solid communication at Ka-Pa has made it worth sticking with then.<//review><pics>None< /pics><Response>None<//Response><gmap_id>0x808f7f08f44dce01:0x295ba9a99fcb259</gmap_id></record>

John and his team were up front, efficient, honest and really pleasant to deal with.  My truck needed a new head gasket—a big job and very labor intensive.  I got it back within a week and it’s running like new at 146k miles.</Review>

<Date>1551923807978< /Date><rate>5< /rate><review>Probably one of the best trustful and reasonable auto shop in SF. John, especially is very much reasonable and believable mechanic I've ever seen, and their service is quick and very much reasonable price. I won't hesitate to use their service over and over again. Even thought i didn't ask, he always shows all works he has done to my car, and respectfully he explains what he exactly did, which is amazing for the customer.  Suprisingly,  price wise, they are very reasonable especially pretty much elsewhere asks at least 20-80 bucks more, and John never did. I really respect his business and enjoy service.</review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

John provides the best auto and tire service in the Bay Area. His team of workers are of the highest quality and at a very reasonable price compared to other Auto services repair shops. Excellent performance in his field of work and honest too.< /review>

Heck yes.  They looked crowded as can be, but I was in there in just a moment.  They didn't have my size tire, but swapped out my spare for me and changed the oil on my big truck for $51 bucks.  Nice and friendly people.  Blessed to find it!< /text>

<Text>When I moved out from Bay Area to Pomona for school, I went around getting haircuts from barbers all over Pomona and surrounding cities. I found Christian & Robertos and settled on it and made my barbershop I go to. I go with Maggie because she's really good at her job and she gives you good quality cut as well as she's professional. Maggie, I recommend.</Text>< Pics>

<Text>I live out out of town but when I come to visit I always get my hair cut here, they are really good at what they do, I always get Maggie, if you go by the main entrance walk to the back side on the left. You can schedule appointments which is useful since its a little busy later on during the day.<//Text><user_id>107009387207635919021</user_id>< Gmap_id>

Not the best atmosphere. If you want a good haircut, be prepared to wait, even if there's nobody in line ahead of you.

The barbers there look at anyone new and turn away. And they take their friends before other customers (not talking about appointments), which can lead to you waiting for a very long time.

They layout, while cozy, is unclear. You don't know where you should really go, or who to talk to and ask.< /Text>

Eddie’s a beast. One of the best out there. He knows his craft, has great communication skills, and will make you look good. When you tell him what you want or like, he give you great feedback and recommendation. The end product is a fresh cut that looks good every time. Go see him.< /Text>

Think I've been coming here almost a decade. Really should say don't come here, but that's because I don't like the waits, which means their work speaks for themselves. Best barbers, barber shop this side of the SGV/IE. Wish I can give them more stars.</Text>

In order to get good service, you have to know barbers, barbers have their clients and they take them does not matter if there is somebody before waiting. I waited for about two hours to get my son haircut. I won't come back to this place. Even if they do good job, they did not care about people waiting for so long time., and I again I won't come back.< /Text>

Very good place to get haircut! Long wait times and if you don't know barbers personally they will skip you to get their friends haircut before yours. The cuts are fresh but you have to be willing to wait awhile and the prices differ from who cuts your hair. Prices can be 15 dollars plus!<//Review>

I just got one of the best haircuts I’ve ever had. I’m from out of town and thought I would give this place a try. They only except cash so this is something to keep in mind. If I’m ever around these parts I will go out of my way to get another haircut here.< /text>

< review>
Came in for a shave and hair cut. Hair cut turned out good but the shave was not what I hoped for and was left with stubble. I was under the impression that a hot towel would be used before applying the shaving cream, it wasn't, in fact no hot towel was used at all.

From the outside, this place does not look like much.Inside, theres modern look to with old style wood cabinets, flat screen television, surround sound and stain glass which adds a nice touch to the place. It's also clean with comfortable seating.

Haircut $11= Good Deal
Shave $11 = This would also be a good deal if hot towels were used. Therefore, it should be $5.

They seem to be expanding the shop. This could result price increase at some point in time.<//review>

The barber shop is set up well, unfortunately their organization is out of control. This place offers a fast pass for $25. The pass is to skip the wait and jump ahead of the line; however, the barbers are unorganize. Even if you choose the pass, there is people angry because they been waiting. So, the barbers end up passing people ahead even if you choose to buy the pass. Also, I do not recommend the hair stylist for the women. I've had my hair cut twice, different ladies and the outcome is "ugly." The ladies only know how to do old school cuts. If you like the old school round leyers or straight cut, this might be your designated stop.<//Review>

<review>I demonstrated a picture to Eddie (barber) of what I wanted, and received the exact haircut I had aspired. No need to continue Googling for more barbers "near me". This is the spot!

They have great selections of fresh and salt water fishes, and pet birds from time to time. Pet supplies on the wall was a little bit tricky to find because it look a bit messy at first, but it gets better as time goes by and by the time you are less disoriented and learnt their logic of placing stuffs around. Although it's a small pet store, but you will be able to get what you want. Decent price. Easy to find parking on the streets and the owner couples speak Spanish, English and Chinese</review>

<review>I'm a second generation customer of this pet store. They have been our go to store for about 20 years. Joe is very knowledgeable (& bilingual!) about the animals. I go to his store for everything I need for my parrot I was gifted from his store 17 years ago. Family run and family owned. I don't know what I'd do without them.</review><date>1529780377674< /date>< Rate>

<Text>If I can give this place 10 stars I will... I will because Joe and Doris (owner) there really nice person always with a smile on there face always there to help you. They have anything you need from salt water fish, fresh water, birds and dogs, cats, hamsters, snakes any kind of animal you might have at home. Whatever you need believe me you will find it here and if you dont see it just ask him he will get it for you. I come here because I have a salt water tank at home with his advice he guide on what to do what I need with my tank and so far is been 2 years none of my fish have die.
But I just gotta say come check it out there really nice people there prices on everything are good/fair I'm just so lucky to have them close to my house in my city.
Thank you Joe and Doris for everything you guys do and treat everyone keep up the good work.< /Text><gmapID>0x80c2cebc0c403489:0x58b92d84c17619fe</gmapID><UserId.>113690477289301740587<//UserId.><resp>None<//resp>< Rate>

This place is very small and people have a hard time walking around. They have a variety of fish and coral but they put as many fish in a tank as possible so there aren’t actually a lot of tanks. The prices are written on a sticky note which is placed on the tanks (hard to read) and some fish don’t have correct prices or aren’t placed right. They have one tank with coral and fish on a top shelf that you can’t even really see so there may only be two tanks of coral you can see. They have a nice variety of clownfish. They have a lot more fresh water fish than saltwater. They are called Bell Bird Farm but only have parakeets and love birds and the rest is fish and pet supplies.</text>

Tight and noisy, this place is hell for hamsters and birds, their cages are too small and overcrowded with the animals looking sickly and halfway dead. The only good thing here is the fish cages which is actually what they seem to care about. The fish tank water is always clean with no dead fishes floating around, and all seem to be bright and happy. Don't bother buying supplies here because you'll be ripped off. Only semi good note is that they will buy any hamsters from you if your hamsters accidentally bred or you got two different genders accidentally. I think they also do the same with birds.</Review>

<Text>I loved this place because the staff was very friendly, spoke pretty good English and had a wide variety of Rare plecos for super fair prices ! This review is biased because I came into the store ignoring all the other pets and supplies, and focused only on their fresh water fish collection. However from an aquarium enthusiast, the fish selection is great ! And the staff is friendly and helpful!</Text>< user_name>

<text>Joel, the owner, is is very knowable and helpful.  You can order aquariums to fit your needs and the prices are great as well.  I highly recommend Bell Bird Farm for a great variety of birds and both salt and fresh water fish and corals.</text>< pics>

<text>I bought my pineapple conure Riley from bell bird farm 5 years ago and have not had to take my conure not even once to vet has been and still is very healthy. Their very attentive and take good care of the birds well all animals. What I like about them is that when you buy a bird, they make sure it's able to eat on it's own when it's a baby still about 3 months before they send them home with you. That shows the commitment they have with their animals and how good they take care of them, which means they care about their customers and don't want to or will not sell an unhealthy animal just to make a sale, that speaks alot about them. I would recommend this pet shop, and will be buying another bird in the days to come.< /text>< pics>

<rating>5</rating><review>Found this LFS by chance on Craigslist. Ad mention a large variety of hard to find pleco's so I decided to make the 20 mile drive to check it out. My first impression was that this place is small and I won't find what I'm looking for. Well I guessed wrong. Found an EDJD for 12.99. 12.99!!! My LFS wanted between $20-$40 for a 1" and got me a close to 2" for a lot leas. Also their pleco selection didn't disappoint. Vampires, golden nuggets, royals, avocado, and pelckoltia compta. Picked up a 2" pelckoltia for $12.99 which I found to be a bargain. Definitely will make the 20 mile drive in the future when I get a larger tank.</review><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None<//resp><GmapID>0x80c2cebc0c403489:0x58b92d84c17619fe<//GmapID></record>

<text>Halibut taco appetizer amazing 👏 bread super good raspberry ice tea great now the not so great. Both the wife's main dish and mine were not that great,she had the fettuccine and spinach and I had the tequila chicken with shrimp both were quite bland leaving much to be desired. Cesar salad 🥗 was great I loved the dressing!

Atmosphere: great outdoor seating. I am quite disappointed because I saw some good reviews and all of the pictures online looked amazing< /text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP_se_Z0AUo-MpczJNcob2Z0W8ABjbcyj39X0Jw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNYDKEbSCO752ik5IRFBDK8p3_WiABOJct1mzuy=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNCSLPh5_-DgWZmlvTf5djVFhFy0ie1fBmJcikg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics>< date>

Food was not up to par as per my previous experiences. Didn't receive correct change when we paid our bill. I usually love this place.<//Text>

Fast and friendly service for it being Valentine's day and being busy. The food was actually much better tonight then when we had dinner here with friends right before the second shutdown. We had the Brussel sprouts. Steak salad, and Chicken Tequila fettuccine.<//review>

Great food. The marsala was fantastic. Only problem was I ordered to go, told it would be done in 30 minutes, got there on time, and waiting an hour for my food. There was only 4 people ahead of me, but many of the 15 people behind me were very upset.</Text>

My first time there, not impressed one bit. The prices were fine, the quantity was okay, but the ingredients were lacking. I had the fettuccine Alfredo with shrimp and it's made either from a flower or cornstarch gravy, seriously lacking cheese... not to mention the lack of heavy cream and butter. That's no way to make Alfredo sauce. The shrimp, while somewhat adequate in size and quantity, were boiled, not sautéed in butter and garlic. They were most likely purchased frozen and already boiled. And the meal didn't come with any sides - no side salad, no bread, nothing. Just a plate of noodles, shrimp, and gravy - that wasn't very good. And the noodles were overdone. I think the cooks need to understand the term Al dente. The wateress wasn't much better. She didn't offer a side salad, and we sat there for over 20 minutes waiting for her to come over and ask if we wanted dessert, which we did. And no grated cheese was offered.<//review>

<date>1541296017699<//date><Rate>5</Rate><review>Fugazzis Restaurant is a corner property on the main drag in Visalia. It is an upbeat, slightly upscale, establishment where Audrey and I chose to spend about 90 minutes to enjoy a nice, full meal.  We split a Mediterranean salad, an encrusted salmon fillet and a side of coconut prawns.  She finally settled upon a Ruffino Prosecco (fruit-forward sparkling white wine) while I enjoyed a Corona Extra (on tap) with lime.  Two bread varieties were tabled at the outset with an oil, white balsamic and red pepper dipping sauce.  The wait staff were relaxed, pleasant and professional.  The table setting, location and style were well suited for a trendy, Italian bistro.  The food was fresh, texture and temperature appropriate in every course.  The  presentation was above average, the flavors subtle, yet challenging.   We paid $50.55 + our generous gratuity for a dining experience well done.< /review>< Pics>

The blackened chicken is really good! I would say this is a “safe” place to eat, your going to get consistently good food but maybe not anything absolutely amazing. They offer bread while you wait and have a really good Brussel Sprout appetizer available as well. As with any restaurant service is all about the waiter / waitress you get and how busy it is at that time.<//review>

<rating>4< /rating><Text>One of the few bistros open in Visalia on the Thanksgiving Holiday.  Superior holiday atmosphere, prompt, courteous help staff.  Our waitress forgot the salad, which would have been an excellent Apple and Pecan toss but, the Pear and Walnut salad would have been equally yummy.  There is a broad range of well seasoned, beef and shrimp, pasta based dishes.  No sausage choices.  Sauces are properly seasoned, not too salty(!) The seating is a little uncomfortable for me but my woman likes it just fine.  Great beef appetizers and beef stroganoff.  Yummy dry portabello ravioli with mushroom cream sauce on the side.   Great wine list and full adult beverage selection as well as full bar.  Average desert menu but, the selections are site-prepared, fresh and outstanding.   We go there just for the warm berry cobbler, coffee with Bailey's and primo vanilla bean ice cream!<//Text>< pictures>

Fugazzis Restaurant is a corner property on the main drag in Visalia. It is an upbeat, slightly upscale, establishment where Audrey and I chose to spend about 90 minutes to enjoy a nice, full meal.  We split a Mediterranean salad, an encrusted salmon fillet and a side of coconut prawns.  She finally settled upon a Ruffino Prosecco (fruit-forward sparkling white wine) while I enjoyed a Corona Extra (on tap) with lime.  Two bread varieties were tabled at the outset with an oil, white balsamic and red pepper dipping sauce.  The wait staff were relaxed, pleasant and professional.  The table setting, location and style were well suited for a trendy, Italian bistro.  The food was fresh, texture and temperature appropriate in every course.  The  presentation was above average, the flavors subtle, yet challenging.   We paid $50.55 + our generous gratuity for a dining experience well done.<//text>

Great food here, the calm chowder was definitely a little bit on the extremely salty side.(Almost like someone added triple the correct t amount)  I would think that a higher end restaurant would have a cook who is taste testing and making sure his ingredients are on point. Which usually they are. Every thing else was good just watch the salt.</review>

<Review>I liked Fugazzi's. I'm not over the top, nuts about it or anything, but it's pretty good. I'm not terribly inspired by the menu, but it was quite bit better than "just average". It was pretty noisy, as well, needing to speak at a very high level, just to be heard by the other half of a table for eight. But, it's pretty good. I'll go again, in the future.</Review><user>115753000447548971215< /user>< gmapID>

<review>I go to this outstanding place every couple of days  as I enjoy the good mood that is outline this place. The crew is very loving and well trained. The service is absolutely rapid. Not to mention, the food they prepare is great. I ate there many times and I was always satisfied. The expense is decent. I suggest this restaurant to all my friends.<//review></record>

< Review>
Sat at the bar.  The bartender knew the person I was with.  They exchanged greetings.  I was never acknowledged...well he (without making eye contact) asked if I would be eating or just a drink.  Had one drink and left.  Hopefully next time I will be greeted.  (So that means I will go back)  I hear the food is excellent.</Review>

<Review>Restaurant was quite busy. Ran the waiter around a bit too much. Not enough staff, food was spectacular, drinks were delicious.  They were also told by State Guvna, Newsom to close down this day which probably effected the low staff issues. If open inside dining, due to Covid be patient. Worth it!< /Review><Rating>5</Rating><userid>112071588436063119058</userid>< Gmap_id>

We were told by a male employee ( manager?) to settle down when inquiring as to why we didn’t have the correct amount of seats for a reservation we had made( weeks in advance). We were not raising our voices or yelling. We also agreed to sit at a separate table away from the rest of the party when the seating arrangement could not be made in a timely manner.

Come on women deserve more respect than that. Don’t talk down to us. Do better fugazzi’s.< /Review><gmapID>0x80952f6455a675df:0x322c0e2cad8a7838</gmapID>< resp>

<review>Fugazzis restaurant is a good place to have a creative really good meal. It’s a little more upscale but you can totally dress casual and feel comfortable. Menu features fresh ingredients, trendy but good food. Portions are generous so you won’t leave hungry like some trendy chic places. They have a full bar and the wait staff is knowledgeable and friendly. A decent wine selection. A good place to celebrate an occasion or just have a weekday dinner.<//review>< pics>

A little upscale, a little hip, and a regular place I visit for meals with the family.

Great atmosphere and attentive staff.< /Text>

For a quick, good lunch try Fugazzis at the Car Wash Cypress and Akers.  Not the ambiance of their restaurants but the same good food.< /Text>

Went in around 2 for late lunch and a cocktail.. waited 8- 10 minutes to even get acknowledged. Not many people there . Gal at the bar on the phone , at least 8 people standing by door waiting. Offered us a table with stools. We said we'd rather have a table. At least 20 open , clean tables in other room but they wanted us to wait while they cleaned a table. We decided to go to Sequoia brewing across the street. Service was 5 star, homemade root beer and crown Royal cocktail and a hot butter rum something... delicious. Turkey sandwich and Philly cheese steak both tasty</Text>

<rate>4< /rate><Text>One of the few bistros open in Visalia on the Thanksgiving Holiday.  Superior holiday atmosphere, prompt, courteous help staff.  Our waitress forgot the salad, which would have been an excellent Apple and Pecan toss but, the Pear and Walnut salad would have been equally yummy.  There is a broad range of well seasoned, beef and shrimp, pasta based dishes.  No sausage choices.  Sauces are properly seasoned, not too salty(!) The seating is a little uncomfortable for me but my woman likes it just fine.  Great beef appetizers and beef stroganoff.  Yummy dry portabello ravioli with mushroom cream sauce on the side.   Great wine list and full adult beverage selection as well as full bar.  Average desert menu but, the selections are site-prepared, fresh and outstanding.   We go there just for the warm berry cobbler, coffee with Bailey's and primo vanilla bean ice cream!</Text>< pics>

A popular place with a good rating normally means good chances for a good dinner. This time we were a bit disappointed. The place is pretty noisy and it is difficult to keep a conversation going across the table. Service was ok but not super good, we had to wait quite a long time for the food (probably because we had ordered pizzas). It tasted good. A minus for the lack of real Vegan options, in practice it was taking cheese off from the pizzas. No specific Vegan dishes.< /text>

It is a great place to eat. Good food and the pizzas are awesome. Love the bread and dipping sauce. Only downside is the noise level. It is hard to hear yourself think but at least your conversations are private. The chocolate puddle cake is absolutely amazing! Not a cake fan but I didn't even know I was eating cake because it was so moist and drenched is chocolate sauce.</Text>

<user_name>Christopher Turner< /user_name><date>1551160682995< /date><rate>5< /rate><review>A popular place with a good rating normally means good chances for a good dinner. This time we were a bit disappointed. The place is pretty noisy and it is difficult to keep a conversation going across the table. Service was ok but not super good, we had to wait quite a long time for the food (probably because we had ordered pizzas). It tasted good. A minus for the lack of real Vegan options, in practice it was taking cheese off from the pizzas. No specific Vegan dishes.</review>< Pics>

Our waitress didnt even offer us water. She did the bare minimal. Our adult drinks were nasty. I will never go back. $60 for 2 meals could of been spent somewhere we felt welcomed. To say we felt racially profiled puts it lightly.</text>< Pics>

My wife and I hadn't been here in a while, but we went for an early Valentine Day lunch.  The employees there were very nice, friendly and attentive.  The food was a little slow to come out, but not too bad, still managed to dine within my lunch hour.  I ordered a Spicy Shrimp pasta plate, which had AMAZING flavor to the sauce, but I must have missed the spice somewhere, also I only got 3 shrimp!!! =/  my wife's pasta could have used a little salt because it was a bit bland, but overall a very good dining experience and good tasting food.</review>

< Review>
The food was prepared and cooked with care on every plate. I ordered the carbanra and it was on point. Everyone's plate was perfect, in everyway. They did get busy and slow, but the whole place was packed by 7 on a Thursday night. If you have never been, then this will surely become one of your favorite places to eat. I haven't found anything on the menu that I did not like, I have been told that I am a picky eater. I only wish that it was possible to give 6 stars.</Review>

They have amazing food their bread they bring to the table is amazing with the oil you dip them in. The truffle fries are great with their aioli especially the jalapeno one. The sangria is amazing it is very refreshing and fruity.< /Text>

The red quinoa and kale salad is super good. My date loved his philly sandwich. The poor point is that it's a little pricey and they should do unlimited bread in the beginning (not just my opinion but many others who've been). The waitress was sweet and helpful and patient.</review>

<review>Fugazzi's impressed me the first time. I ordered some Shrimp new Orleans type of dish and it was very good. I also had a lemon drop martini that was also pretty good. I was excited to go back again and the second time, I noticed they actually changed the dish. It was not even close to the same experience. I felt bummed and haven't been back since. I feel weird now that I don't know what I'm gonna get.</review>< Rating>

Pasta is really good, recommend the Al Pesto Tortellini.  They have this bread and oil for you to enjoy as you wait.
On Tuesday they have really delicious tacos you can order in the blue room.<//Review>

Excellent food. When I was there, the only downfall was the profanity at the bar that I was close to and it was extremely hot, which is why I was near the bar by the door. Loved the brussel sprout appetizer and the angel hair pasta with shrimp. The bread and sauce is excellent as well.<//Text>

<Text>A prime downtown restuarant that everyone in town knows. Went on a normal Friday evening (Jan 25th)and it was pretty busy. It took me 19mins to get a second drink after asking twice.  The waitress was very nice but not the most put together.  The pricing is alittle more than average restaurant but not by much. You can expect to pay $50 for dinner and a drink. I recommend it just be patient when its busy you may wait a while for your food.< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< gmapID>

I wish I could give Fugazzis management 0 stars. They were extremely difficult to work with for an event that we hosted at their restaurant. I called ahead of time to discuss table arrangements and the day of the event we showed up and literally nothing was done how we had decided. They do not offer linens for their ugly silver tables and when I asked them to send me the number of the tables so I could arrange to bring my own, Gabe, the GM told me “just to guess” because he didn’t have time for that. Also, their food was average at best.  That being said, their waitresses were helpful the day of and I do appreciate their hard work. Due to the lack of respectful management, I would absolutely NEVER recommend hosting an event at Fugazzis and I will not be returning. This was an overall very difficult experience.<//text>

<gmapID>0x80952f6455a675df:0x322c0e2cad8a7838</gmapID><text>My favorite place in Downtown Visalia. You always get treated like royalty. Very upscale setting, and amazing ambiance to sit down and have a drink! All staff go far beyond to make you feel welcome and satisfied! The owner Mike and the Manager Gabriel are always super friendly. They always greet you with a smile and make you feel welcome.

My wife and I love this place. This is our favorite local spot in Visalia. Catch it in the evening, and plan to have great drinks, great food, and great service!
Great portions, reasonably priced for a fancy restaurant.
Be sure you dress to impress, because people that go here dress up for the occasion.

Ambiance is great for adults and families, but make sure your kids are well behaved. This is NOT Chuck E. Cheese environment.

This place is a "must stop in" for people visiting looking for a local spot.
The food there is to die for! I've even had the pleasure of eating their food at a wedding, just extraordinary taste!
You have to try the "Al Pesto Tortellini"<//text>< Response>

Little bit of a late review....

Was invited for a midday drink with my buddy who owns his own shop across the way. Had a new Spiked Apple Cider Beer and it was quite refreshing with a crisp and robust taste. Forget what its called, but I would seriously have it again.

Upon the recommendation of both the bartender who happened to b the manager on duty and my lunch mate we had some fried brussel sprouts for a appetizer. Keep in my mind I have never had them because well growing up as a kid you learn to hate them lol. But these were amazing!

I've been here a few times in my life here growing up and they never seem to disappoint. I will be back again real soon.</review>

<text>Worst meal I have ever had. I had the fried halibut fish tacos and the fish was so tough and tasted like it's been under a lamp for hours. I used to get these tacos a long time ago! The quality of food has gone downhill. They use frozen spinach now for example. Just overall downhill and a waste of money.< /text><resp>None<//resp><rating>1< /rating><time>1528812825013<//time><gmapID>0x80952f6455a675df:0x322c0e2cad8a7838</gmapID>< user_name>

Horrible place. Service wasn’t good. I mean I went in there I wanted to order a drink and they didn’t even have the drinks in the menu.! Like come on how am I supposed to know what get. But not just that our server pretty slammed our drinks when we finally learned what they had. Totally bad service and I do not recommend. Also the fettucini is not good at all< /Text>

Definately worth a try id have to go back to give it a better rating. which i think they can get. as all the makings of a great resturaunt were there.

seemed like a great place. they get 1 star for ambience great feel to it. 1 star for presentation it looked good they lost a star for making us wait for almost an hour to get our food. we were done choosing out food and waited for a while for a waiter to take our order, then it took a long time to get the food.

they lost a star for how well it was cooked. i ordered steak medium and what i got was well done and charred. it also said it had mushrooms on it... i literally saw a small sliver of a mushroom.. thats right 1 sliver.

they lost a star on taste, i would give this a half star, and i felt three stars was too good for my experience. the dressing on the salad was good, the flavor of the bbq sauce they put on the meat was good, and the mash potatos were dry, but tasted good. for the price to portion ratio seemed high on the price side, $15 plus tax and tip for maybe 4 oz of steak, salat, a carrot and a small scoop of mashed potatoes... and the meat was burned...

final thought. im not done with this place id try it again. as i understand resturaunts have off days.< /Review>

The salad is fresh, crisp, as if it were just picked from the garden, the bread and bread fusion sauce is soooo good... the halibut tacos (appetizer ) , for the love- of-tacos, YUM! The magerrita pizza, to die for... the atmosphere,  LOVE IT, modern, relaxing,  light music, not loud at all... I will be back!<//review><Pics>None</Pics><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>

Wait time was an hour and 45 minutes. I realize the staff was super busy, but the host was not welcoming at all. We went down the street to another busy restaurant and were greeted by the most welcoming, pleasant host. It's all about the service.</Review>

The service was terrible.  We were seated in the back with a large loud group next to us. And we waited and waited and waited. We finally walked out after 20 minutes.  We walked down the street for a fabulous dinner at Little Italy Restaurant.  Skip this place and go to an authentc Italian restaurant.< /Text>

Chicken Marsella was on the dry side. Lacked much flavor. Spagetti lacked flavor too. Vegetables were best part of the meal. Service was good. This was first time. Could have been off night.<//Review>

Have not had drinks but by the looks of the place i say a drink would be a good idea at night.<//Text><gmap_id>0x80952f6455a675df:0x322c0e2cad8a7838<//gmap_id><user>103266599009787038927</user><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None<//Response>< Rate>

<Text>Owner, chefs, servers, host.... they all truly believe in delivering premium customer service. Their meals are creative and insanely delicious. I'm never disappointed. I once had the pleasure of attending a navy ball where fugazzis catered, a few days later they just so happened to cater at my friends wedding. The food was so wonderful that I went into the restaurant with my family for a third fugazzis experience in one week. I mean, $20 for a chicken Chipotle penne pasta dinner and a classy cocktail. You really can't beat that price for the overall quality.  Keep it up :)<//Text>< user_name>

<Rate>3</Rate><Review>Alot of money for a tiny tostada but it was authentic enough with mexican cheese.  The Chicken was pretty tasty, and even had white meat.  It had a sprinkling of lettuce and it was 95 cents more for a tiny dollap of Guacamole.  The Chips were burnt tasting....can you pleeeeze change the oil?  Burnt oil is toxic and bad to fry things in, I think it is best used for Bio-diesel.
Doubt i will go back...to many other places to try!<//Review>< Pics>

<Review>-1 The service was terrible, the food was cold, the beer was hot from sitting on the bar waiting for the server to actually bring it while they were all grouped in the back just talking to one another, my husband's steak was half right and half burnt, the steak on my salad looked fake and microwaved, we will never go back!</Review>< Name>

<Rating>4</Rating><review>Gorgeous food display with deliciousness to follow. Kinda loud for a date, or family meal; but overall the atmosphere was great. The waiter didn't check on us much and offend more then not we would have to wave him down. Other then that this place was great and I will be going back again</review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP3o_aZqa0tA1lohazhe2Af_LeHQ2_Hh56SJRKV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics><user>109538073680102379436< /user><Name>Gina Cassella<//Name></record>
