Highly recommend this place for acupuncture!! Sappho was so incredibly helpful in every way. I started seeing her once a week for my chronic illness and she had a wonderfully calming presence, was so full of insight and information on what points effected which organs and how they work in conjunction with my fatigue and pain. She gave me useful tips and suggestions for nutrition and health supplements and was always so gentle when treating me. I was having issues with my blood flow and regular periods, and immediately one day after seeing Sappho I got my period and reset my body! I was so thankful that they took my insurance and treated me with such kindness as a patient. I felt so much better after a few months of going to Sappho, I wish I still lived in the area to go to her every week!!<//text>

<Review>Have loved my massages here.   The space is clean, quiet and beautiful.  I have received amazing massages from both Jessica Biedron and Alexandria Steppe.  They both really listened to my needs and stayed away from areas that are too vulnerable to touch.  I so appreciate a sensitive touch that can meet my edge and not leave me feeling terribly sore the next day.  They also incorporate their wisdom and know how with Chinese acupuncture.  Highly recommend this place!< /Review>< gmapID>

Receiving acupuncture treatments from Sapho At ExW has been a saving grace for me throughout 2020-2021! I have experienced substantial decreases in my lower back and hip pain. What I didn’t plan for was the treatments having such a positive impact on my overall well being. It’s been an important practice for me and I’m very grateful to have access to these treatments.< /Review>

East-West Integrative Medicine is one of the best places I have ever gone seeking alternative interventions to improve my health.  I have been there many times for therapeutic massages.  I have had two different practitioners and both, although different, addressed my issue and remedied my pain.  The clinic on Chenery is peaceful, friendly and inviting.  Check it out.  You’ll be glad you did.</Review>

This place is lovely, comfortable, friendly, and  pristine. I've seen many different massage therapists here and, while Julie is my regular, I've never had a sub-par experience. It's usually pretty easy to schedule on the fly if you don't have a preference, but you need to schedule further out for people who have more of established client base.<//review>

I have been going to East-West for about a year. They run a wonderful practice with very talented, caring, and knowledgable practitioners. The atmosphere itself is clean, quiet, and comforting. I’ve mainly worked with Stephanie Haney and she is an extraordinary, calming, and perceptive healer. She goes beyond the acupuncture session and listens to your concerns which makes you feel like each session is uniquely client centered. I couldn’t be more grateful for the calmness she has brought into my life. I’ve also work with Courtney at Glen Park and she is equally as wonder. Everyone at East-west seem to be happy working there and make for an inviting atmosphere. I highly recommend this place.</text>

I got several tmj massages at the Bernal heights location last year. Then I moved back to LA. All I can say is that I think often how much I wish they had an east-west clinic in LA. It’s hard to find a integrative medicine clinic that you can trust & is effective! Miss this place.<//Text>

I love my therapist. She is amazing. Thank you Stephanie Haney! You heal me time after time 💖 Stephanie always takes the time to really hear me and work with my body. She is the first acupuncturist I’ve ever had that I feel takes the work so seriously in wanting to ensure health and well being for a stronger, healthier you! I highly recommend her and I always know when I go in, i am getting exceptional treatment.</review>

East-West is my favorite place to get massages in the city. The therapists truly listen to your needs and provide a session that is tailored accordingly. Carolyn Cohen is especially fantastic, and has helped me recover (physically and emotionally) after the birth of my son. Plus, they don’t use tons of oil like other places—so you don’t leave feeling like you rolled in an oil slick! I don’t have experience with their non-massage services, but I would expect them to be just as great as the massage therapy. It may be a little more expensive than some other places in the city but is worth it in my opinion.</text>

<text>The acupuncture here is incredible.  I had never tried acupuncture before, but after a terrible injury, I turned to integrative medicine. I was feeling better immediately, and after a series of sessions, I was close to my normal self. It felt miraculous, and I don't say that lightly!<//text><UserId.>110127215747859853003<//UserId.>< Pictures>

I have found the best massage therapist at East West. Chris’s approach to massage - especially if you like deeper work -  is different as he has an innate and intellectual knowledge of the body and there is no one like him. I have had a lot of massages in my day and no one tops him in my opinion.His energy is so great, too. I have tried other therapists there and they have also been amazing. My daughter sometimes comes with me and she loves it there , too. Between us we have had Heather and Natasha. I love the space at Glen Park and also at Bernal. It’s calm and relaxing, perfect for body work.<//text>

East-west is a professional and caring clinic. The owner, Marnie, is a skilled acupuncturist as well as a professional and caring business woman. She navigates the complex world of medical billing, creates a beautiful and welcoming physical space, and competently manages customer service and hiring a fantastic staff. I have been treated by at least 6 or 7 different professionals at East-West and they have all been skilled and very competent.<//text>

Been going to East-West for several months now,each time I had a session it was GREAT.
I left feeling better than when I came in.
My acupuncturist is Adam. What a wonderful person. He takes his time with you, really listens. Glad I found out about Adam and East West.
Give it I try it's a great experience.<//Text>

< Review>
Joey Bennett is hands down one of the best acupuncturists in the city.  I've been going to her for over a decade and she's helped me with everything from an injured knee to currently helping me get through chemotherapy with fewer side effects.  Everyone at East- West are top notch professionals.< /Review>

<Text>A very healing place. From the moment you enter, you can feel the healing energy. An amazing amount of time, energy and attention is given every client, to understand your symptoms, strengths and challenges. Acupuncture treatments are so effective at relieving pain and restoring vital energy. I highly recommend this neighborhood gem.< /Text>< pictures>

Highest recommendation for practitioner Chris Robertson!  I've worked with him several times now, to relieve muscle tension and a host of other ills plaguing the middle-aged body.  His deep-tissue work is particularly effective, but I always feel restored after any session with him</Text>< Pictures>

This clinic, and Marnie McCurdy in particular, are the best Eastern medicine practitioners I’ve found. The combination of acupuncture, therapeutic massage, and some herbal remedies over time complemented the Western treatment modalities for my very complicated spine problems. I trust Marnie’s skill and experience and highly recommend East-West Integrative Medicine.<//review>

I was treated with dignity and respect t all times. I was never kept waiting, even at times when I arrived late. at times when I needed a same day appointment, Shannon made sure I had an  appointment. I came to your clinic when I was at one of the lowest points in my life and Shannon always heard me.< /Review>

My favorite therapist is Chris. He does an amazing job working me over. It's always fairly easy to book an appointment and the space is relaxing, warm and friendly.< /review>

<Rate>5</Rate><text>East West is a gem of a place. The ambiance is serene, with thoughtful and stylish decor. It feels relaxing the moment you walk in. The practitioners are all stellar, led by the extremely talented and lovely Marnie McCurdy. I've come here for both acupuncture and massage for a decade, and now I'm spoiled! There's nowhere else that compares.<//text>< Pictures>

East West is full of experienced and wise practitioners that can be trusted with a variety of health care needs.  I love receiving care from Joey Bennett and Marnie McCurdy and recommend their clinic to all of my clients and students.<//review>

Really legit massages every time I've visited. I'm picky when it comes to pressure and the skill of the therapist, yet I've been able to fully relax and unwind here. I'm very appreciative of the service!< /Review>

I have been to E-W half a dozen times over about the same # of years and EVERY time it has been a fabulous experience. Wish they had an office closer to me. Flying there from Florida for a message, although worth it, tends to be a bit expensive.< /review>

I have been going to East-West Integrative in Bernal Heights since moved from NYC three years ago. I have had other massages over the years in NYC and SF. But they have not been as good on a consistent basis.  I now only schedule my regular massage through East-West Integrative, Bernal Heights.<//Text>

<text>EastWest... are you ready to get relief? My need was for acupuncture for a very sore shoulder. Antonella is my acupuncturist/cupping healer. I was feeling emotional from the pain and she not only gave me relief, but had such a warm demeanor and comforted me in a way only a natural healer can do.
Front desk always friendly and helpful- Laurie and Tom. I’ve been to Bernal Heights and Glen Park location.
Thank you East West!</text>< Pics>

The treatment is with respect, I came to check out some why they are charging $4 to make my payment but they explained everything súper responsable and Set me to autopay so that way I save those 4 extra fees

the worst experience.i wanted to cancel a line that i have paying for about 6 months that i no longer need. i had my husband go to the store so they can remove it. he said they were trying to charge him $15 to remove a line. i couldnt believe it i went myself and they said the same thing besides the ugly attitude the girl had she said metro doesnt allow to cancel lines and if she was going to do it i had to pay $15. i ask for the manager name she said she couldnt provide it. My daughter has also made a complain about this store and nothing has been done. The sold her a phone the next day she wanted to return it and never gave her a reciept. Only a paper where they wrote on itand said that was a receipt with final sale in pen. I went to a metro in tustin and they said there is no such thing a hand write receiyts they were suppose to print one out and they also told me that my daughter was charged incorretly $120..when the phone was suppos to be free nd only pay $80.i dont understand my this placeis still open<//Text>

The best experience ever. Today i walk in with an issue on my cell and to my surprise the team member anna was very helpful. She has a great customer service. She literally went the extra mile fixing my problem. Thanks anna for a great customer service. You should get a raise or a big promotion for doing a great job. Congrats< /text>

Very knowledgeable about the products, good customer service. Even though it was very busy because of the holiday season they managed to help me get a new phone efficiently. I got helped by Jennyfer but all the girls are super peppy and helpful. Would recommend this place to friends and family when getting Christmas presents they have everything.< /text>

These girls will do anything to get you out of the store with a smile!! I had a question regarding my plan because I had gone to another store and they messed up my monthly plan so this store helped me resolve the issue not only that but I even walked out with the latest moto G& power, you can tell they know how to do their job. Leaving everything at a great price even their cases :)< /review>

I felt the two women that were there the evening I went very rude and disrespectful. They were hanging out outside. Slow to attend to me and my relative. And their bilingual skills were horrible! For that reason I rate their customer service so low.< /Text>

All I have to say is this Metro stands out from the rest. The employees go that extra mile to have us customers happy. Honestly this is how it should be when u walk in anywere employees with smiles great attitudes respectful and very helpful. I would highly recommend this Metro to my friends and family and i know they will come out satisfied and happy.<//review>

<review>the worst place to go. i went there bought hands free for my iphone. they did not even give me the reciept and i needed the regular hands free and these people cheated gave me the hamdsfree with bluetooth. i told them to check it they said its brand new and works for sure. when i get into my home and i checked them they were not working without the turning on the blutooth. i returned it back and reqiested them to exchange it for the handsfree i want or give me my money back cause i did not need the bluetooth handsfree. they were so disrespectful and they were refusing exchange and return. my god i was so shocked and mad. long story short i came home without exhange or any returned.
please do never go to this place. or do never buy anything from them</review><user>104295715792267135566</user><time>1537141235603</time>< Pictures>

Charged me for phone cases as I bought my phone and they proceeded to sell a phone case separately. I did not notice because I was grieving over a lost family member but when I checked the next day they didn't not give me any detailed receipt of what I bought. ( Basically  they will steal money from you) NEVER GO TO THIS STORE!!!< /Text>

<username>Esther Hidalgo<//username><Resp>None< /Resp><text>So I went to this store to make my payment. Iris tendon helped me and she made sure that I was using the current plan . I was using the 50 $ plan with five gb of internet . But she informed me for that price I could be getting unlimited and so I did . No other store ever checked that !! I'm so happy with her advice and I decided to upgrade to the j7 and got a speaker . Awesome customer service iris . I recommend this store and I recommended you to come with her !<//text>< user>

<text>This store is the store you go to if you want to get ripped off!!! And they don’t provide no receipt because they do not want you to see what they are over charging you for!!!! Which it’s illegal to not provide a receipt, that’s why I called weights and measures on them so they can get audit and finned also the federal-bureau of commerce!...  All those so called employees customer service sucks! They get all offended when you confront them about their rip offs!!! Never again will I deal with IRIS and ANA biggest rip off people at this location! Don’t let them bundle anything to your purchase!

Esta tienda es a donde van si quieren que les roben el dinero... son puras rateras...

Just noticed the girl that works there reviewed this store as great customer service ⬇️⬇️⬇️⬇️⬇️⬇️⬇️⬇️⬇️⬇️⬇️⬇️⬇️⬇️⬇️ IRIS RENDON IS A RIP OFF!!!!!!<//text>< Time>

(Translated by Google) I really like the girl!
I spend all my contacts and applications apart that opened are the only ones that open earlier than other meters by tmobile
And I was only going to make my payment. I ended up buying a new device for my number.
Thanks to the lady I think she was the very friendly manager 😉

Me agrado mucho la muchacha!

(Translated by Google) We went to buy a glass to a phone and a girl iso several attempts to put, but there were air balls, after several attempts we asked him to ask help to the short girl who already has more time there, just came to tell us that He sold it and we put it to him.
I answered that No and he only said how much they paid and he returned the money and he went overbearing.

(Original)
Fuimos a comprarle un vidrio a un telefono y una muchacha iso varios intentos por ponerle , pero quedaban bolitas de aire, despues de varios intentos le pedimos que le pidiera ayuda a la muchacha chaparrita que ya tiene mas tiempo ahí,  solo vino para decirnos que nos lo vendia y que le pusieramos nosotros .
Le conteste que No y solo dijo cuanto pagaron y nos regreso el dinero y se fue prepotente .< /text>

<review>(Translated by Google) the worst place to buy cell phones or accessories. they are a scam. They say it's a final sale and they don't give you your money back. I do not know why give a star if what I want to put is a Madr3 window to this store.

<Review>They have a very nice selection of cigars here. I'd say they're of the top 3 cigar shops in the Sacramento area. If you need a fine cigar this is one of the very few places you are guaranteed to find a good cigar that fits your liking. The lounge area is small, but the selection of cigars is second to none. But don't be afraid to ask. The store associates are incredibly knowledgeable. They can help you find a great cigar for a gift or a new cigar if you're stuck in a rut. They're a real gem of a cigar shop in the Sacramento area.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>{'time': 1603233308189, 'text': 'Thank you for the kind review, we appreciate it.'}<//response><GmapID>0x809b1eb5c00ba3fd:0xa75944636b97cf15<//GmapID></record>

<rating>5< /rating><Review>Tobacco Republic offers an excellent selection of fine cigars at a fair price, and the knowledgeable folks there will recommend great choices when asked. Ron is usually there and has made several excellent recommendations, and he has always steered me in the right direction. This lounge is my favorite place in the area to find the best cigars available. I highly recommend this place if you want to choose some fine cigars and sit back and relax while enjoying them!
The choices available are huge and Ron has a strong relationship with most of the cigar distributors so he usually has the hottest, hard to find brands available, basically unicorn cigars.
Again, highly recommended!< /Review>< Pics>

I have been going here since 2010. Although the selection has changed, the experience remains. There is something for everyone from novice to aficionado. A Few dollars to over $100 from light and underwhelming to full body boldness with unique undertones there is something here for you and your desired taste. However, the best part is the knowledge of the staff and owner so make sure to ask questions if you are unsure of anything; they will be through the door right behind you.😅< /review>

<text>I have little to no knowledge about cigars and wanted to buy something for a special occasion. Had a horrible experience with Casillas Cigars and decided to check out this place afterwords.

Great customer service, I learned a lot in just one conversation. I highly recommend this place to anyone with limited knowledge about cigars.< /text>< gmap_id>

<Text>Great cigar shop with a phenomenal selection and a very friendly and knowledgeable staff. Came into the shop March 8 for the first time & Ron was super helpful in giving my friend and I info on all the cigars and the history of them. The Leaf cigar by Oscar Ron recommended for us was a great cigar. Great experience and will be back again!<//Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

If you are a cigar smoker you have got to check this place out! They have an incredible amount of high-quality cigars to choose from and knowledgeable staff to help you make the selection suitable to your taste! Very welcoming atmosphere. I'm an ex cigarette smoker and only recently started smoking cigars while golfing or fishing. So I needed a little education when it came to Cigars and fine tobacco. The person that helped me was very patient and pleasant to deal with! Whether you're a veteran cigar smoker or someone who only smokes cigars occasionally I strongly recommend tobacco Republic! I have never given a 5-star rating before but tobacco Republic deserves it!<//review>

I stop in Tobacco Republic all the time. Great selection of unique cigars. So nice to find a place that doesn't just have the normal boring stuff. They are a "boutique" cigar shop with a huge selection. One thing I noticed the first time I went in there was they are welcoming and willing to spend the time with you to get exactly what your pallet desires.<//Review>

<Review>Was in the area for a wedding and searched for a shop noting TR with a 4.9 star rating. Since it was my birthday my wife indulged me by going to a cigar shop. I entered the shop and was greeted by the owner, Ron. I headed into the nice sized walk in and was impressed by the selection. Ron can in a few minutes later and asked if I needed any help. We got to chatting and and after hearing my regular choices and that when traveling I look for things I haven't tried yet. He made a few suggestions and I picked a few sticks. I'm sitting here enjoying one of his suggestions as I type this and he was spot on. This shop should be your only choice if you're in the area.< /Review>< pics>

<text>I am not a smoker. I was at the golf course a few days ago and another golfer was smoking a cigar, it had a great aroma. And I ask what was he smoking and he gave me the paper ring off of his cigar because I really wanted to look into where to find one and try it.
So, went on internet and found the tobacco republic cigar store and lounge.
Called and talked to Ron. I realized immediately that I need to be in the shop, face to face with Ron. Upon arrival I explained to him that I know absolutely nothing about cigars. This marvelous patien Gentelman spent about 3 hours with me while simultaneously helping other customers. Later at 3 pm or so, Craig cane in and took over helping me, since an area rep came in to see Ron. Craig continued to help me and I was thoroughly and equally impressed with both gentelman!!  Sooooo, what did they do all this time, you ask?  They gave me a detailed and professional tour of the shop, outlining  the extensive and extravagant products not only available but how things work and why!!
I also had scores of questions answered and explained. Although they stock an array of cigars at many prices, after interviewing me and to best of their educated guess they recommended a cigar that was a very reasonably priced cigar, and guided me away from the more expensive stock, but pointed out the taste that I thought I liked and they felt I would enjoy more.
Even at that point I was curious about the variety of so many to select from, so Craig patiently and methodically reviewed again the inventory and we reviewed a few more. I was so impressed and as well very confident that as a non cigar smoker I made some awesome choices  to experience and enjoy.
I ended up choosing 5 different cigars......I’m sure they felt that was over kill but I wanted to try them in close sequence...I also purchased a cutter and they explained the different reasons to cut the cigar at different depths. Also a nice cigar container with something ( I for get the name) that controls humidity. Bottom line I now feel well educated about cigars AND the drinks and food that best agrees with each type.....I HIGHLY RECONMEBD THE TABACCO REREPUBLIC.
Do yourself a true favor and learn more contact RON OR CRAIG.

Not sure at all how this company is still in business. Geico needs to drop this fraudulent excuse of a so called insurance agency.

They put a non-renewal notice on my policy because the previous owners of my home had a "beware of dog" sign posted on a side gate. Allegedly the inspector reported to them about it, which I don't believe for a second and even if that was the case, the home obviously wasn't even mine at the time of inspection and I never had a dog... genius right? Complete incompetence and not to mention, the policy was way overpriced. They lost a customer and if you read the reviews out there, you'll see I'm not alone. Stay away.</Review>

{'time': 1566495370577, 'text': "Hi Sean, may I ask what type of coverage you're referring to? (Homeowners, auto, business, etc.) We're careful to provide ongoing training and updates to our producers (i.e., your local agent) on our various insurance programs, so they should be able to answer most questions. If not, they should be the ones to find the answers - you shouldn't have to go looking for them. That being said, can we provide some answers to your questions?"}< /resp>
<Review>The fine print takes away a lot of coverages that other companies provide as a rule of thumb.  They may be 5% to 10% less in cost but it's quickly lost when you have to buy supplemental insurance.

Also, their customer service isn't so charming, quick to dump off questions about their company on to their licensed agents... Stuff that the licensed agent shouldn't know, let alone wouldn't know.

Renewal is not very likely and I will start my shopping now instead of waiting until my renewal.

Their posted response is an example of how tone-deaf they are to customer service.       It's not about training other people, it's about having their own people take care of their own business.  Pass the buck often?</Review>< user_id>

Went to get Home Owners Insurance renewed, company sent an individual out to make an inspection who was late and would not answer his phone. Filed a inspection report with invalid information. Was told they were unable to reinstate policy.  Increased the property value by over a $100,000. Stay away far away.<//Text>

<text>Salesman stopped by and called weekly, but once that check is handed over the service goes out the window. We asked for a follow up and modification to the policy, but never happened. Matter of fact, we never saw the agent again or even heard from him. Then, we never received out bills or had our payment auto-drafted as asked MULTIPLE times. So, now we find out we have a policy that has been dropped for months WITHOUT being contacted. Not even once. There was no answer as to why our payment was never pulled, no answer as to why we were not contacted, and no answer to why we were not notified that we were dropped. LUCKILY we never cancelled out liberty mutual policy and were double insured the whole time. I would suggest liberty mutual for anything insurance related.< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>{'time': 1560285078383, 'text': "Hi Charleston Performance, it sounds like you didn't receive the service you deserve.

Unquote.
If one looks at the dozens of negative reviews one can see that this is a standard response that this "Owner" is giving to all those who have suffered at the hands of this bunch of thieves.  Why should I go into private communications with this "Owner" when he has my full name and can look up his records and find out exactly what type of coverage or policy I have, when was it initiated, when was it cancelled, and when was the refund effected.

Removed coverage due to yard being unkept and a small portion of stucco peeling... We are in the middle of an interior remodel and will of course get to the unkept yard but seems to be an extremely conservative reason for removing coverage without a call/email or anything...</text>

Absolutely one of the worst insurance company experience ever.  Inaccurate statements, no communication on issues, no accountability.  Glad to be finding another insurance company.</text>

Once again another hurricane(Flornce). Still refusing to write a denial letter. Again no help from FEMA or the SBA. Over 4 feet of black water in my house. Total shame.< /Review>< user_name>

Horrible claim experience. The did not want to pay for anything. My claim was intiated march then my claim was closed in June with no notice  i was suppose to hace a year to complete repairs and get depreciation.  Then come January i get a notice of nokn renewal. Apparently the claims adjuster reported i had a dog and was running a beauty salon out of my house.  My dad was at my house with his dog and i have hair stuff set up in my house fo r myself and friends and family. I am disabled and mom of a special needs child  i gave up my career but still take care of my friends and family to keep education up. I by no means  runni ng a co.  Now the quotes i am getting are 3x as high! They have completely screwed me!!<//text>

<review>If no stars out of 5 was an option that would be their rating. I started a property insurance claim to water damage for the roof and interior of my house. Needless to say from the get go I had major communication issues with this company. First of all my original claims adjuster apparently left the company and it took about 3 months constant calls, voicemails, and emails and myself asking the reps when I called the main phone # to even mention that we were given a new adjuster. Once I had got a hold of the new adjuster after a few calls and voicemails that were ignored I was then only to be called back when I threatened to call their manager. Just seeing these reviews is a good reason to make sure you check company ratings before you have them insure your property.  As far as the owner coming on here and apologizing there is no need for it. Just fix your company.</review></record>

Great rates and coverages, but I learned that you have to call your local agent for service, not the Arrowhead Agency. They represent more than one insurance company also.<//Review>

<Rate>1<//Rate><Review>Homeowners claim experience horrible. CA, to Fl, to GA, then to my home in NC. Left me in house with NO heat in 17 degree weather, with ice storm coming. Promised next day check, then did not send, nor bother to tell us they did not. Knew I was sick, knew owner leaving for extended period,, and needed check and estimate to arrange repairs. NO one cared. Took over 8 phone called and 6 emails to receive small check for $89 reimbursement for hvac quote.
Universal North American Insurance Company is the "real" insurer". They contract with Arrowhead General Insurance Group to handle policies and claims. Good luck finding info, or humans.Appears just many layers of red tape and different companies "passing the buck".
Now they are cancelling policy claiming I did not prove rear porch repaired. There is NO rear porch! Gave me less than 5 days to prove hvac repaired. Did not matter that delay was due to their negligence. One notice was dated 2/28. A Sunday, interesting they have US mail service when US mail is closed. Not BB rated, ARE rated in rip off reports. Got this policy per Geico recommending. Now considering dumping Geico. If this company meets Geico standards, then Geico has NO standards.</Review>< pics>

Wow!  After a rough couple months I managed to chew down what was left of my nails to a mess.  I’ve never had acrylics and decided to give them a try. Lee was super patient and kind with me.  She did a beautiful job and explained how I can take care of them.

I had no idea they could look so natural.  The price and service was so friendly I decided to stay for a pedicure!  So glad I found a great nail place on my first try in my move to IB.  Thank you, see you in two weeks!<//text>

They try to get you in as soon as possible and the service is so professional by all the people working there they are so nice and helpful! Thanks Nail Tech! 💅♥️</text>< pictures>

<review>Walked in an hour before closing and wanted a coffin shaped pink and white ombré nails and a pedi. They took me in and were very patient. My toes look so pretty and my nails are amazing. Lee did an amazing job. They also take Venmo if you can’t pay in cash which is very convenient. I love my nails so much my mom is going in today. I will be returning ♥️< /review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNYAgmIWFESSQ0ShP0rbpbEV5c3iRWlpIt7eEZR=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures><response>None<//response>< gmap_id>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Review>My second time here!
Both times for pedicures.
I had spent several weeks in the desert and was in desperate need of a pedi.

My technician was friendly, meticulous, we even watched the landing on Mars LIVE!

The chairs are a little aged but massage just fine.

This place is really an overlooked gem. Nothing fancy but you get a great job at a stellar price.

If you want to spend your money on ambiance instead of quality, this isn't the place for you. Which reminds me, it's about time to go again.

Yes, they accept walk-ins when possible.
Adhered to COVID guidelines.
Very pleasant experience.</Review></record>

<Review>The work is pretty good compare to any place I have seen before. The service is also good, I felt like a queen! I went for a full set of acrylic nails and it got to a point where I had three people helping out and making the work go faster. Lee is very professional,  she takes care of every detail and she is respectful and nice.  I like the place. People, from the staff to other customers are nice and helpful.
I'll definitely come back and you should also come and try! I am really happy with the results and that's what we all want,  right?
Five stars for you all today!  And thanks a lot!< /Review><user_name>Estefania Romero<//user_name>< GmapID>

I wanted black coffin ombré acrylics. Mrs. Lee did exactly that :) she showed me examples of the different colors and texture between regular nail polish and gel polish. She was amazing. Can not wait to stunt my new nails on vacation on the Vegas strip</text>

<Text>Wife love this place.  Drive all the way from Eastlake to go here.  They took their time and perform a clean and thorough manicure and pedicure.   wife understands Vietnamese, the ladies working there never say anything bad about the customers.   Most other nail salons, they smile and talk trash about you at the same time.<//Text><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

These people are very fraudulent and very RACIST!! First and last time ever. My friend and I both went in last Sunday for pedicures and I added a manicure at the end. Pedi were 16 each and mani 10. We found out it was cash only at the end he paid for our pedicures whilst I cover the manicure. I gave the guy 10 then he looked at me and said the price changed it’s 15 now. He assumed I wasn’t going to tip and raised the price  ( I already did to my techs I always tip) To avoid any drama I paid this man his 15 and vowed to never return.</review>

I was there before 10 because she told me to come in at 9:45. I didn't get my nails done until after 10 and was there until almost 12. Very busy day for me, I was late to an appointment because my nails wouldn't dry. I mean what kind of nail polish doesn't dry in less than 10 minutes? Paid extra to get the gel top coat and that actually made it worse!
I told the woman how I had seen that they have good reviews which was the reason I went there, she started laughing and patting my hand. I'm not at all satisfied with my nails and will be going elsewhere when I get my fill. As soon as I left my nails were already looking  tore up 😩 Definitely will not recommend this place to anyone!<//review>

<Text>Justin was professional & checked out both the furnace & a/c. He climbed into the attic to change out the fresh air filter as I requested. He reset our service reminders on the system. Great job at a fair price. Thank you!<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None</resp><gmapID>0x808525920595b9e3:0x99a706151483aea8<//gmapID></record>

<Review>We chose this company partially due to Brandon's scholarly knowledge of Carrier HVAC systems and then they did have a very competitive price that appealed to us.  They were significantly less than the Costco HVAC vendor which was unexpected.  At installation time, Hector even cleaned up the existing space where everything went and the visual appearance is great.  The staff is friendly and responsive plus I wanted to support a local competant business if I could.  We expect future interactions to be positive with them for maintenance questions.  They do maintain non-Carrier HVAC systems as well even though they are Carrier vendors.  Strongly recommended.<//Review>< user_name>

Thank you Dependable Heating and Air. Every person I came in contact with during my experience of purchasing and installing my new furnace and air conditioner was professional, friendly, informative and polite. Your employees were punctual and efficient. My new system works great.  I wish other businesses were as great as you.</review>

Dependable Heating & Air Conditioning did an excellent job in replacing the old heating furnace that had stopped working. The customer service representative also the technicians made me feel very comfortable with the decision I made in choosing their company to purchase my new heating system.
Thank you to Dependable Heating & Air Conditioning.< /Review>

We could not be happier with Dependable. We got quotes from several and a couple sales reps were definitely trying to up sale. John Stone came out and listened to what our needs were. He really explained the operating costs of their units and rebate programs available. After choosing Dependable the techs that showed up were on time, worked neatly and made sure all items were complete.  The installation was first class. John even came by after to make sure that all was good and explained the new thermostat. Our home is now more comfortable and after the first month bill came back after the hot weather we just had the savings were immediately apparent. These guys are great.  Mary W.</text>

Just moved into a new house that had a heater under a Dependable warranty so we figured we would give them a call. The issue was a closed door that took the person a half second to fix. I wish they would have asked about some  simple troubleshooting especially because we were in a new house and didn't know how everything worked. Instead they charged my family $65 for literally 3 minutes of work.<//Text>

I guess the name says it all. They installed the original air conditioner which lasted 35 years, they installed a more powerful furnace in 97 that lasted 20 years, and today installed a brand new air conditioner and furnace. I am expecting similar results with the new equipment. They aren't the cheapest and definitely aren't the most expensive, but I got well trained technicians and a no pressure sales consultation. I'll mention a few employees since they took their time and stand out. John, who sold us the furnace in 97, also sold us our new Carrier A/C and furnace. Three techs came on time for the installation. They each tackled their specific tasks and were respectful of our home. Brandon did an amazing and very professional job placing and setting up the new furnace, and Hector did the same with the a/c unit. They communicated everything they were doing and answered all our questions. Overall I would definitely recommend Dependable, but hope it will be 20 years or more before they do a job like this again.<//review>

We've been a customer for so many years.  Last June 20 changed our air conditioner & furnace & was very satisfied with their service.  The people who installed the air conditioner & furnace were all very courteous!  Excellent job!  I recommended them to my cousin & she just changed her's last month.<//review>

Called around noon on a Friday, made an appointment for first available day which was Monday. Amanda called back a short while later and said they could fit me in between 3 and 6 on Friday. James should up at 3:10, diagnosed a bad capacitor and loose wire on circuit breaker. Fixed the problem on an old system. Wife will be very happy when she gets home to a cool house.</Review>

Had new AC & furnace installed. Very professional, nice and on time throughout.  I had other estimates from Dependable's  competition, (including Home Depot) but they were near 80% more expensive!  Remember, always get several estimates.  Many will be all around the same cost, however, many (like Home Depot, etc.) will clearly be trying to take you to the cleaners, period.< /text>

Several years ago, we hired this company as a second estimate on replacing a complete HVAC system.  We were very happy with their price and the quickness of installation.
One year later, the coil unit they installed went out.  I called them, and because the installation was still under warranty, they replaced the part free of charge.
Two years later....the same part went out again.  We called another company (more local to us) to inspect.  They determined that not only was the part faulty, and that this model has a long history of complaints, but that the workmanship done in the attic was so poorly done that it was a hazard, and the entire system would need to be overhauled at nearly the cost of a complete new unit.

I called Dependable to see if there was anything they could do. The woman on the phone was very rude and emphatic that the warranty was expired.  I told her this is the second time this part has completely failed in 5 years. We had confirmation there is something wrong with the part they installed, AND the workmanship, and shouldn't they at least give us a credit toward repair, or actually replace the part, knowing now that they replaced the broken unit with another faulty part?  She said no, they would not.  I indicated to her that they had just earned a bad review if they could not stand by their products and service.

I have now had a second opinion by another company, which not only concluded that the part itself is still under warranty and could be replaced for the cost of labor and new freon (still several thousand dollars), but that the workmanship done by Dependable was indeed shoddy and would need to be redone, now costing us more money to remedy.< /Text>

The heater was serviced Awhile back turned out the platform under the heater needed to be insulated and sealed.
Was a surprise but understood when explained to me,thought was little expensive But a good job done.
And heater will run more efficiently so it's all good.<//review>

<review>Service person, Brandon, came on time. Found the problem and fixed it. Also suggested replacing the unit. He is not your everyday sales person, trying to sell you anything and everything. He explained to me why the unit needs to be replaced. I am convinced because I know he is not here to sell me anything. I can say he is an honest person
I will order a new unit together with a new furnace !< /review>< Pics>

We thought the nurses might have messed up the thermostat programming. Folks at dependable were very accommodating-sending a repair person within 3 hours of the call. Turns out we had a melted wire in the outside unit which shorted out the system.  Brandon fixed it and suggested we install an easier to read/use thermostat too. We breathed a huge sigh of relief when the air kicked in.  And we all love the BIG numbers and easy use of the new thermostat. So happy with this company!!< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

We asked for a jump duct to be installed after a loft conversion to a bedroom. We went with DH&AC because they were the original installers of our HVAC and did a really nice job on our annual maintenance.

However, we were disappointed for the following reasons:

1. They were an hour late.
2. They did not clean up after themselves; note, we just finished a renovation and saw how a more complex job was cleaned up.
3. After talking over potential placements, the duct was installed without consulting us. It's functional, but it would have been professional to let us know that where we wanted it was not possible but and if the proposed area would be okay.<//Review>

I'm a very satisfied customer, not just for the line of AC's they have, but during the last heat wave, our AC went out (capacitor) and Don Wagner had a rep here who fixed it before five P.M. the same day. Can't praise them highly enough.<//Text>

I asked for a side of fruit and they charged me and I literally got an orange and the side salad was just cabbage no dressing. The food was not hot and fresh I just was let down.

Smelled like sewer inside, hot and muggy and they won’t turn the AC on. Hard to enjoy a meal when it smells and feels like you’re in florida 👎🏼👎🏼</Review>

This location seems to really give out small portions of meat. When we called to make a compaint they didn't seem to really care, and said there was nothing they could do about it.< /text>

<text>Have been going to this place for almost 2 years because it's close to home but this place has Bad customer service, cashier has an attitude. A lot of times my orders are Always wrong!!! Meat can have a lot of fat compared to other flame broiler's.
It's an okay place.< /text><username>Rocio Hdez C< /username>< user>

The guy there didn’t charge me to clean up the back of my hair! Usually at Supercuts, they will automatically charge me 6 to 8 bucks to something like that.

Absolutely recommend this place to anyone. Quick, clean, professional, and straight to the point!</Text>

This place is amazing. The staff are super friendly, very young aged staff that seem to really care about their clients. This business only specializes in haircuts, so don’t expect to get your hair colored here! Lol. Nevertheless  they do waxing too. Come early because this place gets packed on the weekends, you can usually reserve a spot if you give them a call, but they take a lot of walk ins as well. One more important thing, THEY only TAKE CASH! So bring cash, I used to forget, but now I always remember. Such a great spot, and even better prices! Definitely one of my favorite!<//review>

Friendly staff, great cuts, but I’m not sure why they charged me $15 and the sign says $12 for men! Unfortunately, the barber didn’t get any tip because of the difference between the posted prices and what they ask you pay. I hope to receive an answer from the owner to maybe readjust my rating.<//review>

<text>Very good service and great people. Very affordable and the skills of high end hair salons. I wouldn't think of going anywhere else for my haircut. You can even choose which stylist you prefer.  Great service.< /text>< Pictures>

Friendly😊, Excellent Prices👍🏽, Good cuts👍🏽, but the wait list can be verrry long especially right before a holiday or on Saturdays!!! Be warned that you may have to wait (1hr+) if you go during those times. Go early during the week instead.<//text>

Highly recommended if you need a taper or a fade or even a fresh cut in general, prices are very reasonable you won't regret it.< /review><Rate>5</Rate><gmap_id>0x80ec6b8100000001:0x49288ae290b87714< /gmap_id><user_id>114714140987108368582< /user_id>< Time>

I first started going to.Superstars almost 6 years ago and Started getting my Haircut by Abby..I'd Have To Honestly Say She's Given Me The Best Haircut I've Ever Had..She Was Only One I Would Let Cut My Hair..But Sometimes She Wouldn't Be Working So I've Had Almost All Of Them Cut My Hair..They All Cut Hair Good And The Females Are All Too Beautiful And They're SO NICE! If I Have To Choose A Favorite It's  Paloma.At First She Came Off A Little Stuck Up & Snobby...Just Kidding...Not Really.. ,But She's Really Nice..I Had No Idea She'd Be So Much Fun To Get A Haircut From...I Don't Even Care That She Cuts My Hair Crooked ALL OF THE TIME....She Blames It On My Head Being Crooked & She's Probably Right...Paloma Has Actually Given Me The Best Flatop I Ever Had...I Like The Way Elizabeth Cuts My Hair Also..She Is So Pretty But She Scares Me At Same Time..I Wouldn't Want To Make Her Mad!...If You're In A Hurry & Dont Have Much Time Then Request Abby, She Is Probably The Best And The Fastest One.... .Superstars .Is Best Place To Get A Haircut Especially For The Price! It's only 10.00 So We Can Always Leave A Good Tip...They Work Hard...They Definately  Deserve It!< /Text>

I am not going to say anything negative about this restaurant. They are trying to become a new restaurant after the year we have had. CONGRATULATIONS TO THEM 🎊. Myself I wouldn't be able to eat here every week, but I would come back and have a dinner :) Again you guys I hope you succeed and you have a full house.< /review>

Ordered the burger with garlic fries, burger didn’t taste like anything except the onion in the middle. Only thing on my order that had flavor was the garlic fries.</text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Review>This place blew my mind. I haven't had a dinner this delicious in a long time. I just finished 10 minutes ago and there wasn't a single flaw I could perceive. The service was fantastic, the atmosphere very cozy. And the food...whoever made my dish takes pride in his work, and it shows. Even in my appetizer, antipasto, I was able to experience flavors I had never even known about. I can't believe such a place has been so close to home without me even knowing. If I had to nitpick, I'd say they were ever so slightly understaffed and because of this I came in a bit confused lol. I will definitely return and tell my friends about this spot. It deserves more business.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

Food was great and hot and the bread is very good. The waiter was very friendly and constantly checked up on us if we needed anything. Will definitely be returning soon.<//Text>

My wife and I actually like the place. What we don't like are their hours. They open at 2:00 P.M. on Sundays which we go eat when we get out of Church at Noon. Then they close too early! We feel rushed to leave. If not for the schedule, I'd give at least 4 stars.<//text>

<review>Found this little gem on our way back from Sacramento from an advocacy Forum. I highly recommend it the calzone was off the hook. It was huge not enough to eat while I was there, but was able to bring it home.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Rating>

<text>Just had lunch at Pasta Pronto. Can't say enough wonderful things about this place. Had the Linguini Polermo...so many wonderful flavors in that pasta! First time there but certainly won't be the last! Great to have a place like that in Ceres.Beautiful atmosphere as well.. What to try on my next visit?</text>< Pictures>

First time, my friend and I go to pasta pronto. The food was good; however, the service wasn't good. The waitress didn't offer lunch specials, while it was offered to other customers, we didn't get offer the fresh cheese on our food, while other customers did. It is the small details that will make the service great, or bad. At some point I was wondering if the waitress disliked us. I love Italian food, so I might be back and I hope the service its better.<//text>

I will not trust anyone to touch my face except her. She is so thorough and so good at what she does. Since I've been coming to Nadia regularly, my skin has noticeably improved, it looks more nourished, cleaner, hydrated, younger. I receive comments from my coworkers and family, they notice the change in my skin and ask what I've been doing differently.

What I like about Nadia is she's very honest and so sweet.
Her place is so clean, every time I come to see her, she never disappoints; always provides the best quality work. I look forward to my facials every month. Love her!<//Review>< Pictures>

<Review>My experience was just perfect I initially booked 2 different treatments and shortly got a call from Nadya telling me it is not a good idea to do 2 treatments back to back. That what I call honesty,  before I would go to big spa hotels and it was just buy this do this and keep selling me expensive useless products. But not with Nadya she took her time and explain to me step by step of the treatment, she also told me I was buying too much products and it was actually hurting my skin. In all my years my skin has not been as great as when I began my treatment with Nadya. She is simply the best l recommend her for anybody that is seeking to have the best possible skin treatment< /Review><Time>1583188966113<//Time></record>

When you find someone great to trust your skin and face, no matter what season is outside:)
Nadya delivers results and is very passionate about the care she provides to you as a client. I’ve been coming for skin treatments for a good 4 years now and tried almost everything that she had to offer from her menu. Love the up to date machines she uses,  skin care products and masks are top quality!  Plus , the bed is so comfy, fresh sheets ...you feel  cosy and relaxed. You can change into gown and get under the blanket or choose not too, its up to you.

At the beginning I was a bit skeptical but very curious about chemical peels. But after thorough consultation Nadya explained to me which one will be safe and is best to use for my skin type. Also, I learned that fall/winter is the best time for chemical peels as air gets cooler, sun is less strong,etc.So I proceeded adding LED light at the end that helped to calm the skin in minutes. So cool! I was expecting to see my skin super red after the procedure but it was just pink and did not feel over sensitive or abrasive.

I did all the after peel care Nadya told me to do at home and my new skin appear so smooth, healthy looking and few freckles got lighter!

Thank you Nadya!!< /text>

<Text>Always looking forward to get my treatment with Nadya. She is very knowledgeable about skin, also she is amazing person to talk to. I live in New York but come to LA often, every my trip I make sure I do make my appointment, so my skin feels flawless after a long flight. She uses most modern modalities and European skin care lines. Also I do get my spray tan, she have the best organic solutions and color comes out perfect.

Nadya is absolutely the best. I received a gift certificate for Valentine`s Day and it took me almost half a year to find time to go in, cause I moved from LA. But when I back in LA and get free time I finally decided to use my gift.
What a gift this was. Her room is so relaxing and she is a very sweet, caring and knowledgeable. I really enjoyed my time with her. I almost fell asleep)))) She told me a little bit about what she was doing with each step. She really knows her stuff and a line which Nadya carries is a wonderful product and keeps my skin looking hydrated and youthful. Recommend her to all, even the men!</Text>

Ever since middle school I've struggled with acne. For years, my skin was one of my biggest insecurities and depleted me of any confidence that I used to have. Once I decided to go to Nadya and get the anti-acne facial, my face was cleared from years of pigmentation and scars after a few sessions and my confidence was fully restored. She offers really affordable prices, quality service and a very relaxing environment. I definitely recommend you go to her. In the picture below, on the left side, I had multiple under-the-skin pimples during the summer of 2020. On the right side of the photo is me after a few anti-acne facials and chemical peels with Nadya. My skin is doing much better now as Nadya is always well prepared to treat all types of acne.<//review>

Nadya is absolutely great: very professional, truly cares about the long term result of her work and provides customized skin care without selling unnecessary and heavy procedures and products. I did various skin cleaning procedures and always leave her salon feeling refreshed and bright.< /Text>

I don't normally write Yelp reviews but this is worth it! I have never had a facial and was warned by friends that I would be in extreme pain. That wasn't the case with Nadya. Her technique was great and made sure I was comfortable during my session. I will definitely be back and the location is perfect.

Already referred all my friends!
Great experience !</review>

<Review>I'm so glad I found Nadya!!! I've been to many different places for facials but never felt compelled to leave a review or keep going back for more treatments. I have gone to her regularly now for facials, micro dermabrasion and chemical peels since December 2016. I have made facials a regular part of my skin care and I always look forward to going back to Nadya. My skin looks and feels great as a result of the amazing work she has done. She is super gentle and does a great job at always leaving my skin with a healthy glow. I highly recommend Nadya, she will not disappoint!<//Review>< UserId.>

The micro current facials are the best, I used to feel like I needed extra makeup to perk up my skin but I feel confident bare-faced after just two of Nadya's facials.  Nadya is great, friendly, professional, and keeps skin care simple and low maintenance.  I'm a skin product junkie and we paired down my routine and I saw even better results.

I've done a facial and two chemical peels so far. Absolutely loved the results and how Nadia walks you through the process. She will also follow up with you to see how your a skin is doing after a treatment. She'll give professional products to take care of your skin at home that will last you for a very long time.

As a teen who has struggled with acne for over 3 years, I can finally say that I have never felt more confident about my skin than I do now. Nadya is one of the most understanding and intelligent women I have ever met, and she really knows what she's doing. I remember when I went in for my first pca peel, she sat down with me and we talked thoroughly about any problems I had concerning my skin, and what steps we needed to take in order to fix those problems. Although I've only had 2 pca peels, I have seen an improvement in the texture of my skin, but I still have a long way to go with the hyperpigmentation. I will 100% keep seeing Nadya. She's amazing!</text>

Highly recommend to try her out for the following reasons:

[1]  Very positive, friendly and warm personality: she very much so cares about all her clients, and always delivers great results no matter if it's early or late evening appointment.

[2] High Standards: As esthetician, Nadya is exceptionally professional and thorough, uses only good quality products like organic " Eminence", "PCA",etc to name  a few.

[3] European touch : something different and very pleasant...You will feel it through Nadya's hands when she works on your skin.

[4] Well kept, clean, beautiful, relaxing skin care studio with comfortable bed and luxe linens.

[5] Excellent price menu to choose from. Best value for the best facial!
My facial treatments usually in a range of $ 60-85 plus tip.

Although, parking in Westwood could be a bit complicated but with Validation for only $2 for 2 hours you keep your car safe inside Trader Joes parking structure right across the street.</Text>< Pictures>

Nadya is by far the best esthetician I have ever had. I had an acne facial (I'm an active 22yo male) with added microdermabrasion, and the actual facial process proved really enjoyable. Her methods are very thorough but also gentle. She performed every extraction without any discomfort from me--which I have never experienced before. Her knowledge is also unparalleled--her world-class esthetician education is clear in the way she explains what she's applying to your skin, and how it will work.

She also took a lot of time before the actual facial to get to know my skin, and learn about my routine, so she could best tailor the facial to my skin's individual traits.

After only four days, my skin is almost perfectly clear. In fact, it's as clear as it's ever been. I'm looking forward to going back, and intend to make her my only esthetician.< /Text>

[3] European touch : something different and very pleasant...You will feel it through Nadya's hands when she works on your skin.

[4] Well kept, clean, beautiful, relaxing skin care studio with comfortable bed and luxe linens.

[5] Excellent price menu to choose from. Best value for the best facial!
My facial treatments usually in a range of $ 60-85 plus tip.

Although, parking in Westwood could be a bit complicated but with Validation for only $2 for 2 hours you keep your car safe inside Trader Joes parking structure right across the street.</review>

<Review>Nadya is by far the best esthetician I have ever had. I had an acne facial (I'm an active 22yo male) with added microdermabrasion, and the actual facial process proved really enjoyable. Her methods are very thorough but also gentle. She performed every extraction without any discomfort from me--which I have never experienced before. Her knowledge is also unparalleled--her world-class esthetician education is clear in the way she explains what she's applying to your skin, and how it will work.

She also took a lot of time before the actual facial to get to know my skin, and learn about my routine, so she could best tailor the facial to my skin's individual traits.

After only four days, my skin is almost perfectly clear. In fact, it's as clear as it's ever been. I'm looking forward to going back, and intend to make her my only esthetician.<//Review><Rate>5< /Rate><user>113599601820144800363</user><Name>Benjamin Tabbush</Name><Gmap_id>0x80c2bc81710df379:0x873287b12b411cfe</Gmap_id>< time>

Nadia is the best, hands down. I will not trust anyone to touch my face except her. She is so thorough and so good at what she does. Since I've been coming to Nadia regularly, my skin has noticeably improved, it looks more nourished, cleaner, hydrated, younger. I receive comments from my coworkers and family, they notice the change in my skin and ask what I've been doing differently.

What I like about Nadia is she's very honest and so sweet.
Her place is so clean, every time I come to see her, she never disappoints; always provides the best quality work. I look forward to my facials every month. Love her!</Review>

My experience was just perfect I initially booked 2 different treatments and shortly got a call from Nadya telling me it is not a good idea to do 2 treatments back to back. That what I call honesty,  before I would go to big spa hotels and it was just buy this do this and keep selling me expensive useless products. But not with Nadya she took her time and explain to me step by step of the treatment, she also told me I was buying too much products and it was actually hurting my skin. In all my years my skin has not been as great as when I began my treatment with Nadya. She is simply the best l recommend her for anybody that is seeking to have the best possible skin treatment</Review>

When you find someone great to trust your skin and face, no matter what season is outside:)
Nadya delivers results and is very passionate about the care she provides to you as a client. I’ve been coming for skin treatments for a good 4 years now and tried almost everything that she had to offer from her menu. Love the up to date machines she uses,  skin care products and masks are top quality!  Plus , the bed is so comfy, fresh sheets ...you feel  cosy and relaxed. You can change into gown and get under the blanket or choose not too, its up to you.

At the beginning I was a bit skeptical but very curious about chemical peels. But after thorough consultation Nadya explained to me which one will be safe and is best to use for my skin type. Also, I learned that fall/winter is the best time for chemical peels as air gets cooler, sun is less strong,etc.So I proceeded adding LED light at the end that helped to calm the skin in minutes. So cool! I was expecting to see my skin super red after the procedure but it was just pink and did not feel over sensitive or abrasive.

I did all the after peel care Nadya told me to do at home and my new skin appear so smooth, healthy looking and few freckles got lighter!

Thank you Nadya!!<//Text>

Always looking forward to get my treatment with Nadya. She is very knowledgeable about skin, also she is amazing person to talk to. I live in New York but come to LA often, every my trip I make sure I do make my appointment, so my skin feels flawless after a long flight. She uses most modern modalities and European skin care lines. Also I do get my spray tan, she have the best organic solutions and color comes out perfect. Cant wait for my next trip and my appointment with you Nadya. Thanks a lot</Text>

Nadya is absolutely the best. I received a gift certificate for Valentine`s Day and it took me almost half a year to find time to go in, cause I moved from LA. But when I back in LA and get free time I finally decided to use my gift.
What a gift this was. Her room is so relaxing and she is a very sweet, caring and knowledgeable. I really enjoyed my time with her. I almost fell asleep)))) She told me a little bit about what she was doing with each step. She really knows her stuff and a line which Nadya carries is a wonderful product and keeps my skin looking hydrated and youthful. Recommend her to all, even the men!< /review>

For years, my skin was one of my biggest insecurities and depleted me of any confidence that I used to have. Once I decided to go to Nadya and get the anti-acne facial, my face was cleared from years of pigmentation and scars after a few sessions and my confidence was fully restored. She offers really affordable prices, quality service and a very relaxing environment. I definitely recommend you go to her. In the picture below, on the left side, I had multiple under-the-skin pimples during the summer of 2020. On the right side of the photo is me after a few anti-acne facials and chemical peels with Nadya. My skin is doing much better now as Nadya is always well prepared to treat all types of acne.<//text>< gmapID>

I don't normally write Yelp reviews but this is worth it! I have never had a facial and was warned by friends that I would be in extreme pain. That wasn't the case with Nadya. Her technique was great and made sure I was comfortable during my session. I will definitely be back and the location is perfect.

Already referred all my friends!
Great experience !< /Review>

I'm so glad I found Nadya!!! I've been to many different places for facials but never felt compelled to leave a review or keep going back for more treatments. I have gone to her regularly now for facials, micro dermabrasion and chemical peels since December 2016. I have made facials a regular part of my skin care and I always look forward to going back to Nadya. My skin looks and feels great as a result of the amazing work she has done. She is super gentle and does a great job at always leaving my skin with a healthy glow. I highly recommend Nadya, she will not disappoint!< /Review>

I love Nadya's skin care. As a die-hard Eastsider it takes a lot to get me to travel this far west but Nadya's facials are totally worth it.  The micro current facials are the best, I used to feel like I needed extra makeup to perk up my skin but I feel confident bare-faced after just two of Nadya's facials.  Nadya is great, friendly, professional, and keeps skin care simple and low maintenance.  I'm a skin product junkie and we paired down my routine and I saw even better results.  If you want to take your facial game to a whole new level go see Nadya ;)< /review>

As a teen who has struggled with acne for over 3 years, I can finally say that I have never felt more confident about my skin than I do now. Nadya is one of the most understanding and intelligent women I have ever met, and she really knows what she's doing. I remember when I went in for my first pca peel, she sat down with me and we talked thoroughly about any problems I had concerning my skin, and what steps we needed to take in order to fix those problems. Although I've only had 2 pca peels, I have seen an improvement in the texture of my skin, but I still have a long way to go with the hyperpigmentation. I will 100% keep seeing Nadya. She's amazing!</Text>

<Review>Love, love, love all my facials from Nadya!

Highly recommend to try her out for the following reasons:

[1]  Very positive, friendly and warm personality: she very much so cares about all her clients, and always delivers great results no matter if it's early or late evening appointment.

[2] High Standards: As esthetician, Nadya is exceptionally professional and thorough, uses only good quality products like organic " Eminence", "PCA",etc to name  a few.

[3] European touch : something different and very pleasant...You will feel it through Nadya's hands when she works on your skin.

[4] Well kept, clean, beautiful, relaxing skin care studio with comfortable bed and luxe linens.

[5] Excellent price menu to choose from. Best value for the best facial!
My facial treatments usually in a range of $ 60-85 plus tip.

< review>
I don't normally write Yelp reviews but this is worth it! I have never had a facial and was warned by friends that I would be in extreme pain. That wasn't the case with Nadya. Her technique was great and made sure I was comfortable during my session. I will definitely be back and the location is perfect.

Already referred all my friends!
Great experience !</review>

<Rate>5</Rate><Text>Ever since middle school I've struggled with acne. For years, my skin was one of my biggest insecurities and depleted me of any confidence that I used to have. Once I decided to go to Nadya and get the anti-acne facial, my face was cleared from years of pigmentation and scars after a few sessions and my confidence was fully restored. She offers really affordable prices, quality service and a very relaxing environment. I definitely recommend you go to her. In the picture below, on the left side, I had multiple under-the-skin pimples during the summer of 2020. On the right side of the photo is me after a few anti-acne facials and chemical peels with Nadya. My skin is doing much better now as Nadya is always well prepared to treat all types of acne.<//Text>< Pics>

<text>Nadya is by far the best esthetician I have ever had. I had an acne facial (I'm an active 22yo male) with added microdermabrasion, and the actual facial process proved really enjoyable. Her methods are very thorough but also gentle. She performed every extraction without any discomfort from me--which I have never experienced before. Her knowledge is also unparalleled--her world-class esthetician education is clear in the way she explains what she's applying to your skin, and how it will work.

She also took a lot of time before the actual facial to get to know my skin, and learn about my routine, so she could best tailor the facial to my skin's individual traits.

After only four days, my skin is almost perfectly clear. In fact, it's as clear as it's ever been. I'm looking forward to going back, and intend to make her my only esthetician.</text><Rate>5<//Rate>< response>

< Review>
Love, love, love all my facials from Nadya!

Highly recommend to try her out for the following reasons:

[1]  Very positive, friendly and warm personality: she very much so cares about all her clients, and always delivers great results no matter if it's early or late evening appointment.

[2] High Standards: As esthetician, Nadya is exceptionally professional and thorough, uses only good quality products like organic " Eminence", "PCA",etc to name  a few.

[3] European touch : something different and very pleasant...You will feel it through Nadya's hands when she works on your skin.

[4] Well kept, clean, beautiful, relaxing skin care studio with comfortable bed and luxe linens.

[5] Excellent price menu to choose from. Best value for the best facial!
My facial treatments usually in a range of $ 60-85 plus tip.

<Rating>1<//Rating><Review>Horrible service. I ordered a cake from them and when I come to pick it up there is no one in the bakery section. I called to see if I can have someone come assist but all they can tell me is they must be on lunch to try later then hung up. I waited an additional 15 mins to see if they would send anyone to assist but no one arrived. I called again got the same person and when I asked if there is anyone else that can assist me since I just need to pick up the cake he just responded "like I said last time you called they are on lunch and we are not sending anyone else only they can give it to you". I didn't know just getting a cake order out was such a special request. The exact reason why I barely shop here.<//Review>< Pictures>

Big store, good selections, great prices and great staff. Went in for new years eve and, though everywhere was busy that day, the staff helped everyone out smoothly by having all their cashier lanes open. Unlike most stores, in my opinion. Lady named Miriam helped me out getting my liquor and was very friendly. I thought it was going to be chaos but I was pleasantly surprised how easy of a time I had here.<//review>

<review>For the most part always good deals. Customer service could be a little bit better. But then again they seem short-staffed. Either way still good place to shop always clean always organized and definitely always easy to find what you're looking for.<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

It was a hell of a lot bigger than I'm used to, took me some exploring to figure out where certain things were. Ok pricing on the things I was looking for. The cashier was nice and helpful.</Review>

A little hard to do shopping due to there inventory no restocking of shelfs so was unable to shop some items. God forbid if you have go to the restroom, because their kept lock due to bad customer make a mess, at least that what we where told by management. So I guess the rest of us get punished for other people's actions< /text>

<Review>Nice store have everything you need. Parking lot is a bit sketchy (people and it's a bit dirty) but the store itself is nice.

Not the best meat. I go to Stater Bros for beef (steak and what not) but they do have a nice selection of pre-marinated meat that I like. Also, their tripe for menudo is always good (unlike Cardenas).</Review><Pics>None</Pics><response>None</response>< GmapID>

Usually a Good experience. They still need some Racial Discrimination Training but its getting better slowly. There is a Security Guard Woman late 50's that's pretty unfriendly and refuses to speak to customers while having A full blown out loud phone conversation while on the clock.</text>

Coming here at 9pm is not full , but  not empty.  Leah the cashier , I assume is new. The customer she is currently is helping has WIC. Leah doesn't know what she is doing and has asked another cashier for help 3 times . She even asked her manager Martin for help. They came over to help her and left as soon they did. I have been in line waiting patiently for the last 45 min. I had a lot of little items so I didn't want get them all in the cart and put them back on . This was such an inconvenience. The manager didn't apologize, the cashier didn't apologize. Customer service is a huge thing for me and they were horrible, starting from the boss all the way down to the guy who was sweeping, to the cashier. I will never come to this food for less again. Saving a dollar or two isnt worth the headache and the waste of time. Service was so freaking horrible. I am sticking to stater Bros from now on. At least there they open other lines if there is more than 3 ppl in line and they care about the customers time.</Text>

I love Food for less . but they need to do their floors. Its all ways clean your in a ghetto place so you'll find those weirdos at night sometimes. But love the fact they have security there. One again it's kind of ghetto here. But over all its a great place to shop if ypu go at night and your a girl go with someone alot of homelessness and weirdos around at night.</Text>

The prices seem to be slowly climbing. If you were to show up just after opening time , you will not see fresh produce, or fresh meat. If the need to use the restroom becomes an issue, you will have to find an open register isle( if it’s not blocked with a shopping cart ) and ask one of the cashiers for the pass code that opens the restroom door. What a pain, and it’s a little embarrassing if the store is crowded. Outside the store you will find transients all over the place.< /Review>

<Review>I wish I could give it 3 1/2. I like the store itself as far as the deals and selection but not the atmosphere..the vibe is off in this store just people looking for drama and I'm trying to shop I don't have time for high school drama while shopping to feed my family. Sorry food 4 less not your fault necessarily.</Review>< pics>

<review>(Translated by Google) In Food4Less you find the groceries you need at a fair and competitive price. You must take your bags or pay an extra for them in the store. There are no "baggers", you must put your purchase in the bags yourself. There is also no "security" (security guard) in the parking lot of some stores.

(Original)
En Food4Less encuentras los comestibles que necesitas a precio justo y competitivo. Debes llevar tus bolsas o pagarás un extra por ellas en la tienda.
