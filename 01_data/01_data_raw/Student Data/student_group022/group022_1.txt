I came to the arena last year to learn jujitsu and Muay Thai. My first experience since day one was amazing. The people, instructors, and staff were fantastic. I Unfortunately had to leave for personal reasons but I plan to return July if possible. I would recommend this spot for anyone looking to get into MMA, boxing, or just get fit.< /text>

<Text>I am very happy that I joined The Arena last September (2018). Sure, it doesn't smell so pretty ...there is grunting, groaning, sweat on the ground (ugh).  But there is true instruction, learning and growing on every level that is happening everyday.  What they invest in is the coaches, students, fighters and the staff.  Not the fluff.

The gym is wonderfully diverse with many different cultures and backgrounds.  You will immediately see that when you walk in.  So you will never feel like you are "different" or that others will not accept you.  You will also need to make the effort to join in.  No hand holding here.

Of course, The Arena is not for everyone.  So I suggest that you set up an appointment for a tour and maybe take a class.  Have your list of questions and concerns.  They will honestly answer those questions/concerns and will not force or guilt you to join like other places do.  It is your choice.</Text><UserId.>100883341419385467208<//UserId.>< rating>

< review>
I went to website and registered to take a class 10 days in advance. I also followed up same morning with a phone call, no answer so I  left a message due to potential COVID restrictions. No one answered and no one returned my call. I arrived at 10:10 for a booked 10:30 Muay Thai class. The man at front desk was RUDE, snotily stated " we don't offer free trials". I said, oh ok I can pay I registered for a class he replied " we aren't letting anyone take classes (he was NOT wearing a mask and never bothered to put one on). I said well the website let me book and I called the number this morning and left a message...he rudely saud Yeah, ok well I don't know but we're aren't offering classes. I hope he was the owner and I'd independently wealthy because his rude, unhelpful and unmasked face is definitely a hindrance to new business.<//review>

<userid>113215605408712468432</userid><review>Only reason I gave them 1 star is because of their predatory billing and contracts, the gym debited me for 2 months ($200) after they closed the doors for Covid-19. Attempted to contact by phone and mail but no answer or refund, I was forced to cancel my card to stop the charges. When they closed the doors and denied everyone access, the contracts and billing should have ended by California law (.Calif. Civil Code Section 1812.85(c)). I've since moved out of SD and given up on getting a refund, it's sad to see a business taking advantage of crisis... I hope some of my money makes it's way to the trainers.</review><Gmap_id>0x80deaaface17ee89:0x4fab12c9ef0a6283</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

The gym is very clean and organized. There is a consistent schedule that is easy to work around depending on if you want a morning or night class. Everyone is very welcoming and I truly feel like I get to partake in a family atmosphere. I attend the classes that can have quite a few people in it, depending, but at the same time still getting alot of person to person feedback on where I need improvement.< /Text>

<Review>Great coaches, I loved all the classes I took. But it's all about their contracts and making their money off of you. They led my buddy and I to believe that since we're military, right when we get out we can just show our DD-214 and it's as easy as that, FALSE. We had to go through so many obstacles and it's been a real pain, still dealing with it currently and I've been out of the military for over 6 months and I'm living in another state. They make it seem like they're super military friendly but in the end it's a hoax.< /Review>< user>

One of the best decisions I've made in my life is to walk through the doors of the Arena and sign up for a 2 year commitment. I am a personal trainer that loves being fit and challenged physically physically but I never knew the I could push my body to the next level like I do at the Arena. The classes are amazing and the instructors the best in the industry. One of the most greatest things that I have found is that I am now a part of an close knit community. I've never met a group of people who have been so welcoming and respectful to each other. No matter what skill level everyone who goes there are always willing to help so I feel as if I have a personal trainer always helping me. I am now the in the best shape of my life and I look forward to learning new skills every day. I'm an extremely happy gym member and I hope more people walk through the Arena doors to have the same life changing experience I have had! I will be forever thankful.</review>

Best gym in San Diego, hands down. No one else is even close. From the quality of the training and coaches to the overall vibe and friendliness to the honesty and integrity of everything The Arena does. If you're serious about learning from true masters of their craft, this is the best choice. Also, you will find a true brotherhood here, which is rare indeed. But if you're not the type to train hard or you want something for nothing, then go look elsewhere. This is a real place for real fighters or those who truly want to learn the arts.</Text>

The awesome energy and knowledge that you get in the Arena is outstanding. From the people that train here, the staff to the world-class coaches, everyone is friendly and eager to help you with anything.

As a first time student in MMA, The Arena welcomed me with a free trial to see their classes and what they offer. I must say I was beyond impressed during my first day and felt very welcomed by the coaches, staff, and members of the gym. Since the first day I started, everyone in the gym is always willing to help one another. The coaches instruct the class as a whole and walk around to further explain and instruct techniques. Overall, if you come here with a positive attitude and ready to learn, you will find this gym to be the option for you. Whether you're here to compete or just here to learn the sport, The Arena coaches, staff, and members treat you with much respect. With that being said, I'm beyond 100% satisfied with my decision in joining The Arena.</Review>

The Arena's facilities, instructors and classes are absolutely the best in the San Diego area. Very professional and friendly, even with some of the larger class sizes the instructors will do their best to pay attention to everyone, regardless of skill level. This being said, I would advise that you only sign up if you are serious about MMA training, and know that you will attend enough classes for the monthly cost to be worth it, and that you will be staying in the area for a while. Definitely take advantage of the 30 day trial and don't let them sell you on a membership until you are certain that you'll be able to get in there often enough and that it is something you want to pursue. The management system/company they use for membership is a bear to deal with when cancelling a membership. The Arena itself requires a 30 day notice of cancellation, which is fine. However, the management company requires hard-copy proof that you are leaving the area of the gym, and they want you to mail it to them at some odd location where they are based. There is no way to do this online, the Arena can not do it for you at their location. I understand that this system is in place to protect the gym from flakes/frauds/dishonest people that would probably sign up and quit like crazy if they had the opportunity, but it does make it difficult for folks like me that just turned out not to have the time or energy at the end of the day to make it in on a regular basis.< /text>

Honestly one of the best places to be ! Unfortunately can't go back due to issues with default account so would recommend maybe doing a monthly payment option I believe it's more but way worth it in case your find your self without work and can't keep up with payments other then that great people/ great trainers some of the best in my opinion in San Diego that I wish I could go back to this place<//Text>

<Review>The atmosphere of the arena is amazing and there are so many people there wanting to achieve their goals in fighting and in life. Being there reminds me that if we want something we have to put in the work for it. With that there are people there who want to support you on that journey which is huge. The different classes avaliable allow you to try any type of blood sport you’d like! For me, Muay Thai has been a huge game changer in my confidence and mind body unity. So anyone wanting to get more in tune with their mind and body, along with building confidence, you have to check it out The Arena!< /Review><resp>None</resp><pics>None< /pics>< rate>

This gym is incredible! It works for very advanced fighters and for beginners like myself. It has a wide variety of martial arts for you to choose from and at various times of the day. The people there are friendly and the coaches patient and very skilled. This is my first fighting gym I have joined as an adult  and I have enjoyed it a lot so far. An overall well rounded gym.< /Review>

I’ve started training at this gym about 2.5 months ago and I love it! They have classes available all day, which is rare and accommodating. I’ve learned so much more than I’ve been able to learn at other places. The instructors are great! They help beginners but expect you to put your part in. It’s combat training so it should be this way. If there is leeway people don’t get ahead so I really like this.<//text>

<Text>Great gym if you want to some training done properly. Everyone is pretty chill and willing to help each other out. The teachers will inspire you to get better at what you're trying to do, plus compared to other gyms the price ain't that bad. Would recommend if you're serious about training.< /Text><Gmap_id>0x80deaaface17ee89:0x4fab12c9ef0a6283<//Gmap_id>< rate>

READ YOUR MEMBERSHIP CONTRACT CAREFULLY!
They require 30 days notice and a written letter sent by certified mail to Arkansas to cancel membership. All membership fees incurred during 30 days are paid by member as well as an additional $50 cancellation fee.

Nice gym though. They have a top notch facility and great coaches. The training at this gym is truly second to none. Don't let the membership contracts scare you off right away.</review>

I've been looking to get back into a boxing gym for some time now. Came across The Arena while doing an internet search & decided to go check them out. So glad I did. Super friendly staff & a clean gym. Instructors are super cool also & everyone is very friendly, even for a newcomer like myself. If you've been wanting to get into a boxing gym definitely check this place out.< /text>

<Text>I have met some amazing people at this gym. From Mike to Jamarr, truly some of the nicest people you would ever meet. After only a few minutes, you become family, not strangers. With more classes than you could possibly take, there is ALWAYS opportunities to learn, train, and gain more understanding. I LOVE this gym, the people, and what they are doing here. I love it so much, that my girlfriend and I are moving to San Diego to be closer for training. That’s right... I currently srive2 hours to attend both classes and private lessons. That’s how much I love these guys! Do yourselves a favor... just open the door and say “hi”... you won’t regret it!<//Text><gmap_id>0x80deaaface17ee89:0x4fab12c9ef0a6283< /gmap_id>< response>

The coaches have you learning the fundamentals in an easy step by step manner. The staff is great! Every time I leave the gym I have a smile. Trust me you will have fun! Also, if you got no gear than no problem because they have lender equipment. Just need to show up.< /Text><gmapID>0x80deaaface17ee89:0x4fab12c9ef0a6283<//gmapID><Rate>5<//Rate>< Pictures>

When I moved to San Diego I signed up at a different gym and after only 2 weeks I was looking for a new place to train. From the moment I stepped foot inside of the Arena MMA I new I was home. There is a great vibe from the front desk guys who are knowledgeable about all of the classes/disciplines as they also train. The Coaches are all world class (and some world champions) level and as approachable as can be. Also, enough good can't be said about management and the Owner! Always making sure we have the best of the best to train with, top of the line equipment, new mats, outsourced prof. cleaning crew! If you're serious about training and you're not at the Arena MMA, then you can't be that serious.<//Review>

I joined this gym a few months ago and it has everything I was looking for. Friendly staff and knowledgeable and world-class coaches who are willing to show you around and teach you the ropes, and that's whether it's your first day or you're trying to go pro. Members are cool too and make you feel like you're joining a family. Been to a lot of gyms and I know I made the right choice here. Excited to see where this gym takes me.<//text>

The Arena is one of the best MMA gyms to train at. I use to train at another studio and the hours of operation didn't line up with my constant change in schedule. The Arena has a stacked schedule, there's a class every hour! The facility is very clean, recently upgraded their striking side of the gym with some very legit gear as well as new mats for both striking and grappling ends. Individual showers are a plus. I really enjoy the environment, train with a lot of cool guys on and off the mats.  I'm honored to train at such an arena with the crew and under amazing coaches.</text>

This place is amazing. It's a huge facility with 2 boxing rings and a ton of heavy bags. The other half of the gym is dedicated to grappling with a miniature octagon in the back. They have different classes that run all day at different experience levels so everyone can participate. Most importantly there's no pretension.  Everyone there just wants to improve and help others. Truly a gem in San Diego. Stop by for a free class!<//review>

This place is amazing. It's a huge facility with 2 boxing rings and a ton of heavy bags. The other half of the gym is dedicated to grappling with a miniature octagon in the back. They have different classes that run all day at different experience levels so everyone can participate. Most importantly there's no pretension.  Everyone there just wants to improve and help others. Truly a gem in San Diego. Stop by for a free class!< /text>

The best decision I have ever made in my life. This gym is more than your typical martial arts gym, where you can just release some steam and frustration. It is a place where you can be reborn into a better version of yourself. It is a place where you can defeat yourself and become a stronger, wiser individual. It is the place where my life was changed forever =) I truly recommend this gym to anyone who wants to change their lives forever =))) we are all one big happy family that will push each other to grow more and more everyday =)< /Text>

Class was friendly, and the BJJ instruction was methodical and easy to follow.  There were pro mma fighters, white belts to black belts, all types of people in the gym in different classes.  There was no aggressive looks or posturing that  can happen at gyms like this.

Seemed like a good place for beginners and people looking for some tough rolls/sparring.  Thanks for the tips and welcoming atmosphere<//Review></record>

If you truly want to learn technical fighting styles, this is the place. Coach Chuck and Kru Mark will take a microscope to your progress and you will always be aware of where you are and what you need to work through next to improve. If you're looking for some sort of cardio Billy Blanks style Tae Bo nonsense, you're going to have a bad time here lol You WILL get a cardio workout, but you will also definitely get your thighs chopped and your head rocked back a few times. My experience here is only with the Muay Thai classes, but if I had more free time I would absolutely spend 2-3 hours here in classes a day. I was hooked after my first free class and will definitely renew my membership indefinitely.< /Text>

I started at the Arena a few months back, looking for a place where I could learn to actually fight. I practiced some martial arts as a kid but had not done any intensive workouts for about 20 years. The instructors at the Arena are great teachers. They do not coddle, and are always very real, both in the manner in which they teach and with the content of the classes. I have taken classes in Jiu Jitsu, Muay Thai, Boxing and Filipino Martial Arts (Eskrima/Kali), and all of the teachers are expert and instill confidence that you are learning worthwhile techniques and drilling for necessary conditioning.  Coach Willie, Coach Charles, Coach Henry, Coach Tone and Coach Joe are all seasoned professionals and good people. The facility itself is well maintained, and the class schedule is awesome. I love that classes begin a 6am and run all day on the weekdays. I am looking forward to the next couple years of training as my time here so far has been one of the best learning experiences of my life! Thanks to everybody who works so hard to make The Arena happen.</Review>

The Arena. What a great place to get your money's worth. I joined recently 3 weeks ago to say and every time I come it's alway a great experience. It doesn't matter if your a beginner or a pro the staff and coaches are well aware and will help you to the next level anyway possible as long as you are dedicated to yourself. I plan to continue my journey here and help me learn more about myself and techniques.<//Review>

I consider this gym to be my home away from home, all the coaches are extremely welcoming and motivating. The second you walk through the door and start training you get a feeling of camaraderie and all the egos are left at the door. Wether you're a beginner or an experienced fighter this place is perfect for everyone and if you're looking to master the martial arts or just get in the overall best shape of your life then this place is perfect for you.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

This gym has the best combination of facilities, people, and instruction around.  The instructors are second to none. They do a great job of teaching anyone no matter what level their skill level, whether you are a complete novice off the street to a seasoned professional.

The facilities are some of the best you’ll encounter anywhere in the country.  The mat space is large, open, and clean.  The showers are clean. Sometimes classes get crowded but that's to be expected when you're training at one of if not the best Combat Sports/MMA gym in the country.

I give THE ARENA MMA my highest recommendation.<//text>

<Text>This gym is excellent. I came here as a beginner, and everyone has been extremely nice and pleasant to work with. I picked this gym for their boxing classes, and I love them. All the coaches are extremely helpful and nice and want you to get better. This isn't a gym with a workout video. Its a gym that actually helps you train and learn. It is a safe environment for both males and females, and I highly recommend this gym to anyone interested in learning how to box. The trainers, the staff, and all the members at this gym are great. There are no egos at this gym. I have been with this gym since last summer, and I plan on staying!</Text>< Pics>

I really enjoy training at the arena. I am a student at UCSD and the many classes that the arena offers allows me to train while attending classes which is amazing. Plus there is world class coaches there like UFC legend Chris Leben and Jiu Jitsu legend Baret Yoshida just to name a couple. The staff and students there is very friendly and willing to help any way they can.</text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><review>I have had the experience to train at several other gyms in San Diego. I see there are a lot of complaints with ABC financial. In my experience after a year of training it was easy to end my contract. Every gym needs to make money. It just is what it is. Other gyms have much more extensive means in regards to getting out of contract. To the point that you just want to rip your hair out. Now, in regards to the training you have so many people that trains at The Arena with so many different styles, and classes that it is an amazing gym to take part in. If you are looking to just get fit or become a fighter this is the place. The experience people have in this place is through the roof. Don't have an ego and you will have a great experience. If you are just a loud mouth douche head over to Golds Gym and get you pump on. Highly recommended and I will be back  mid May to get back to my training after being in Arizona for University.

The facility is always clean, has world class instructors who all leave their egos at the door and become students the minute they walk in. The rest of the staff, and manager Mike are fantastic, they keep the morale high and competitive, but still friendly and welcoming for new members. The location is great; plenty of parking, near lots of healthy food, and easy freeway access.

This gym is dedicated to 2 things. #1 building successful fighters that are equipped for competition and victory. And #2 Taking care of the individual. I have never been at a gym that has felt more like home. Everyone here from the instructors to the person at the front desk makes an effort to serve the needs of the individual. I am proud to call this my home gym.< /text>

The Arena is an amazing gym with exceptional facilities and an atmosphere that fosters growth and deters ego. I've been training here a few months and by far I am most impressed with the coaching staff. The coaches are patient,  approachable, and extremely knowledgeable in their disciplines. I would definitely recommend this gym to anyone wanting to train for competition or just to meet fitness goals.<//Review>

I’m pretty un-athletic but after training for 3 months at The Arena, I was able to compete (and win) in my amateur MMA debut. I credit it all to my coaches and training partners at Arena.  Not only are the coaches world-class, they genuinely care about the success and well-being of their students.

Great gym and staff. Started this month and getting back in shape primarily through boxing and high intensity training. Plenty of parking, bathrooms, and showers, which is a plus. Looking forward to losing the weight with this crew.< /Review>

This gym is amazing if you plan on competing in any combat sport, or if you're looking for real self-defense ability. The instruction for each discipline is great. Brazilian jiu-jitsu, boxing, muay thai/kickboxing, judo, mma, etc. They probably have the most available classes w/the largest variety of combat sports of any gym in San Diego. The instruction is all quality too. Its a fighters gym, so there's plenty of guys there who will test you & help you get better as you're learning as well.

Many other gyms with cardio kickboxing type programs may have legit technical classes too, but the clientele they attract aren't always the type to test you that you'd be able to defend yourself in real situations. HOWEVER, some do also have those tough individuals while also offering more amenities. For example, this gym does not have full locker rooms/showers, nor saunas, or those supplemental beneficial classes like yoga. It's purely combat, which is not good or bad, it just is.

They are pretty expensive though. You could say they have that cost because of the amount of available classes, but the average person will only train 3 disciplines. Other gyms, nearby too, have many of the same classes & quality- in addition to having a sauna & locker rooms. It all comes down to instructor preference & what you can afford. I like these instructors & students, so I stay.<//review>

The Arena is an amazing gym with exceptional facilities and an atmosphere that fosters growth and deters ego. I've been training here a few months and by far I am most impressed with the coaching staff. The coaches are patient,  approachable, and extremely knowledgeable in their disciplines. I would definitely recommend this gym to anyone wanting to train for competition or just to meet fitness goals.</Review>

As a beginner fighter that's a few weeks into my membership, I can tell you that I love The Arena and that I already feel at home here. All of the staff & coaches have been respectful & friendly. The other members of the gym have also been friendly & helpful in helping me to learn new martial arts.

I already feel more confident when walking down the street & I love the absolute smorgasbord selection of classes... 150 a week! On a whim, I can go learn some grappling, submission or not, gi or not... some striking... Thai, American, Dutch... whatever I want, whenever I want. Also, unlike another nearby MMA gym, The Arena offers Judo classes. And you know... Ju can't use what judo know!

The Arena has top instructors for each discipline that are 100% sold-out, all-in. Some are there seven days a week! Their Muay Thai / Muay Boran coach is straight-up from Thailand and has been training for 50+ years. Their Judo coach is a 6th-degree black belt from Poland. The MMA / wrestling coach is an actual UFC & bare knuckle fighter. I could keep going, but you should stop wasting your time reading reviews and just come check out The Arena for yourself today!< /text>

Learned more in 3 months at Arena than I did in 3 years at my previous gym.

I’m pretty un-athletic but after training for 3 months at The Arena, I was able to compete (and win) in my amateur MMA debut. I credit it all to my coaches and training partners at Arena.  Not only are the coaches world-class, they genuinely care about the success and well-being of their students.  Countless times, my coaches went out of their way to help teach me things that I was struggling with.
On top of that my training partners were top-notch, consistently pushing me to the next level. Everyone seems to share the same goal of learning and growing. The result is a strong community with a tradition of winning.
I cannot say enough good things about The Arena. It’s by far the best gym and community I’ve ever been a part of.< /text>

The gym has phenomenal coaches, is beginner friendly, and has extremely clean facilities. The biggest selling point for me was how many classes are offered throughout the week. Even with an extremely busy work schedule I can still make the classes I'm interested in.< /review>

I'm a bit biased because I have been a student of Baret's for many years, but The Arena is one of the best run martial arts gyms I've ever been to. The facility is always clean, has world class instructors who all leave their egos at the door and become students the minute they walk in. The rest of the staff, and manager Mike are fantastic, they keep the morale high and competitive, but still friendly and welcoming for new members. The location is great; plenty of parking, near lots of healthy food, and easy freeway access. I'm thankful to be part of The Arena family and look forward to many more years there.</review>

<text>I worked out here yesterday and was totally impressed. Coming from someone with a gym membership at Fit and Equinox... this place feels like it 100% fills a void I have. First hour was a raw group core exercise class where things were constantly being switched up. Second hour we boxed... I've only boxed a handful of times and the intructors were very patient and thorough. Def worth checking out if you want to give your body a change from your plateau.<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

The Arena is a wondeful gym that leaves you feelig satisfied after every workout class. It’s definitely a positive environment and the instructors are more than helpful and teach you so much about discipline! I appreciate that their classes are scheduled throughout the day which makes it easier for someone who schedules vary. Definitely worth getting a membership if you are planning to be fit and stay in shape!<//review>

They really focus on your goals and help you reach them whatever they may be. The staff is super friendly and this is definitely a welcoming gym.

I joined this gym about 2 months ago.  I had no prior experience with MMA.  So far, I have been focusing mostly on the boxing fundamentals class.  I have found the instructors and other members to be friendly and generally easy to work with.  Also, the facilities are very good.  I would definitely recommend this gym.</Text>

<Review>I've had the pleasure of training in a number of different gyms throughout the world and with San Diego being a major hub for the combat sports, I was very selective when I was looking for a place to call home. Although there are many great gyms in the area, The Arena felt like that home from the moment I walked through the doors.
If you're looking for a place to grow and train with some of the best in the business, check this place out.<//Review><pics>None<//pics>< GmapID>

The Arena is a great place to either start or continue your martial arts journey. The coaches are world class, the classes are full of excellent training partners and the schedule is flexible enough to meet anyone's needs! The facility itself is continually being upgraded with new equipment, although it is already state of the art. All in all this is the place to train in San Diego.</review>

So far it has worked out for us, and we have seen a lot of good changes since we started. The strength and conditioning program is incomparable to anywhere else I have ever been. The fact that I have been able to stay at one gym and continue taking classes from the same instructor for 2yrs. speaks volumes. The schedule for any of the other classes are very forgiving, usually classes in the mornings repeat in the afternoons. I haven't tried out the Muay Thai or BJJ class, but the boxing coaches are some of the best out there. They are patient and focus on good technique before anything else but based off of the pedigree of all the coaches, you will get a good experience regardless if you participate in Muay Thai, BJJ, Boxing, or Wrestling. Without a doubt this gym has become a corner stone for our daily life. We wouldn't switch if you paid us. Definitely check out Coach Andy's strength and conditioning class.... its painful in all the best ways.</review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None</resp><gmap_id>0x80deaaface17ee89:0x4fab12c9ef0a6283</gmap_id></record>

This is one of the best gyms in San Diego hands down.  The coach's here are very helpful and informative from grappling to striking to the strength and conditioning class.  I've been coming to The Arena for a few years now and I can say that the coach's here dedicated to their teachings and to anyone who wants to learn.  Besides the coach's another good thing about The Arena is that the gym members and fighters are also helpful.

The facility is big enough to divide the room into two section, the grappling side (run by coach Baret and Jake) and the striking side (run by coach Vince, Charles, Joe and Kru Mark). The strength and conditioning class is in a warehouse with plenty of "toys" run by coach Andy.  If your looking for a gym to get into shape and learn new things The Arena is the place to be.< /Text>

The Arena is the best gym I've ever been to. You get more than a workout, as soon as you walk through the door, you have a staff and group of instructors there to assist you. You have a selection of one 170 classes a week in various combat sports such as boxing, jiu jitsu, judo, MMA, Muay Thai, and wrestling. There's even a room dedicated to strength and conditioning. Call to schedule your free trial and come see what The Arena is all about.</review>

If you're looking to train seriously or just to get in shape, I highly recommend you check out the Arena. I've never done any type of combat sports, so I had no clue what to expect. Everyone is great and are really helpful.</Text>

<resp>None<//resp><Text>I've been going to The Arena for a almost a year now. This gym doesn't compare to any other MMA gyms in San Diego, they have a variety of classes that are held all throughout the day. Facility is very well kept up and clean, front desk is excellent, and the instructors know what they are teaching. Not only do you get a good workout every time, you will leave class feeling amazing since most of the time its an entire body workout. Pro's and different fighters come in to sparr which is always fun to just watch.

I highly recommend stopping by to check it out, and maybe even trying a class!<//Text><Time>1454257378223< /Time><pictures>None</pictures>< gmap_id>

The Arena has everything you would want at a fight gym, whether your goal is to train for upcoming fights or to simply learn different disciplines of Martial Arts. in addition to the main training gym, they have a great weight room and conditioning area if you are looking to build strength and stamina in addition to developing your fighting skill.  If you want to work had, challenge yourself, and learn from great experience, The Arena is the place to be.< /Review>

This gyms has everything for you. Coaches are all patient when teaching techniques, whether is kickboxing, Muay Thai, Boxing or Jiu Jitsu they will walk you through it until it sticks. Beginners, intermediate or advance they offer a class for you. Definitely recommended!< /text>

I've been at the Arena since 2013 and haven't looked back ever since. I came in with an open mind and willing to learn what I was capable of. At first I thought it would be kind of scary but the staff treats everyone like their own and really make you feel welcome. Here their are no egos and everyone is their for the same reasons you are. I originally began training Boxing and Muay Thai when I signed up. I dabbled in a little bit of Jiu Jitsu but never really got into it until I bought my first GI. Now I mostly only train Jiu Jistu and i feel my progression not only physically but mentally as well. It all has changed my life for the better. The instructors as well as team mates are top notch, and really look out for you. If you're looking to get into any sort of martial art, and get in shape for a killer deal, then look no where else cause you found the spot.<//text>

This is one of the best gyms in San Diego hands down.  The coach's here are very helpful and informative from grappling to striking to the strength and conditioning class.  I've been coming to The Arena for a few years now and I can say that the coach's here dedicated to their teachings and to anyone who wants to learn.  Besides the coach's another good thing about The Arena is that the gym members and fighters are also helpful.

The facility is big enough to divide the room into two section, the grappling side (run by coach Baret and Jake) and the striking side (run by coach Vince, Charles, Joe and Kru Mark). The strength and conditioning class is in a warehouse with plenty of "toys" run by coach Andy.  If your looking for a gym to get into shape and learn new things The Arena is the place to be.</Review>

The striking class was super hands on with Vince who is extremely technical with the way he teaches. The jiu-jitsu coach was really welcoming and knew what he was doing on the mats and with teaching. Super nice staff and overall a 10/10 experience I would highly recommend this gym for any level of fighter you'll be welcomed with open arms by everyone!</Text>

<text>The Arena is a very good clean gym. They provide over 170 classes a week and have a strength and conditioning building separate of the gym. What's  even more greater is the coaches here I get to train the the Legendary Baret Yoshida for Jiu Jitsu. The Arena is also very competitive which provides for the best training. Highly recommended 5 out of 5 star</text>< gmap_id>

<Text>My interaction with the owner of this facility hasn't been that great. I sensed a little too much attitude from him torward myself and other visitors who inquire about memebership and pricing of this gym. Bragging about how many memebers they have. Where is the proof?  Could be all smoking mirrors! For example: Whats in your gym that is different from the gym down the street victory MMA $59 a month with no contract...
Is it your staff, equipment or ...? Cause they advertise the same as you do!</Text>< pics>

<resp>{'time': 1523333480269, 'text': 'This is an obvious plant for Victory MMA. And while we don\'t bash other businesses, we will point out our differences. First, we offer 150 classes a week for $99 a month. Nowhere else on the planet comes close to that for Combat Sports. Second, our programs, classes, and coaches are all top of the food chain, led by former UFC stars such as Chris Leben, Jiu Jitsu World Champs like Baret Yoshida and even 4x USA Olympic Boxing Coaches! While there might be some gyms that have equal programs to us in one of their disciplines, not one is nearly as strong as us in all of our programs across the board. Our results prove that. Third, we constantly invest in improving and growing our business. We started with 3000 square feet 12 years ago and now we have close to 30,000 sf.  This is all done so we can provide the best training environment possible. Fourth, our environment is totally unique. We are 50% military and 99% male, with an average age of 24. This allows to conduct high speed classes and training that is hard to replicate in other more commercial environments. Nothing against those environments, but we\'re totally uninterested in running a gym that way. As we like to say, "Friends Don\'t Let Friends Cardio Kickbox". Fifth and most important, our students and our fighters are incredible on so many levels. We have over 1200 members, with hundreds who regularly compete. There are no egos and everyone is on the same team, trying to improve themselves as well as one another. So if you want to truly compare us to other gyms, just come on in for a Free Trial and see for yourself. Admittedly, we\'re not for everyone. But for those that can take advantage of what we offer, we\'re the best in the business.'}<//resp><gmapID>0x80deaaface17ee89:0x4fab12c9ef0a6283<//gmapID></record>

So if you can't find a class to learn in, maybe the gym isn't the problem because everyone else seems to do just fine. Third, at $99 a month for 150 + weekly classes, we're the best deal in Combat Sports, period. If you think that's expensive, then 24 Hr Fitness is probably a much better fit for you."}<//resp>

The Arena gym in Point Loma is  the best combat sports gyms around hands down! I was fairly nervous coming in for my first formal jiu jitsu class, Zach and Ryan were incredibly helpful and encouraging, I immediately cancelled the membership I had at another local gym and started training here. The price is incredibly reasonable and they offer everything every day so there is no worrying about weather or not it will fit in your schedule.<//Text>

I've been attending the jiujitsu classes, at the arena, for the better part of a year now and couldn't have better things to say about the gym. Jake's fundamentals classes have been excellent. Baret is an extremely special coach that has spurred lots of growth in my grappling. Everyone at the gym is very friendly as well.</text>

<Review>Great gym! The staff here is very helpful and friendly. If you are on the fence about starting your mma training because you're concerned about you skill level, just make the first step and come in. The staff will be more than happy to set you up with any equipment you need and ALL skills levels are accommodated for here. As a beginner/intermediate in jiu jitsu, they were very welcoming in any other classes I was interested in. Highly recommend this gym!<//Review><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None< /Response><gmapID>0x80deaaface17ee89:0x4fab12c9ef0a6283< /gmapID></record>

I have been at the arena for a month now learning Muay Thai with Kru Mark. He goes at the learners pace wether you're a beginner, or experienced person. With over 150 classes a week for the knowledge of the coaches and the price. You can't see yourself anywhere else but the Arena!</Review>

<review>I first got introduced to the gym by my brother. I was a bit nervous first going in, as for not having any combat sports experience, but the staff has been nothing but friendly and helpful. I mainly just train in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu with Baret Yoshida. The way he teaches, you can tell that he really wants every student to succeed. The schedule of classes works out great, accommodating for the mornings and the nights, you can always find time for a class. Coming into a combats sports environment is a bit intimidating, especially being a beginner, but everyone is just there to get better and have a good time. The more i have been coming, the more i feel apart of The Arena family. Great environment, I highly recommend this gym for anyone who is planning to participate in the sport casually or even competitively!< /review><gmap_id>0x80deaaface17ee89:0x4fab12c9ef0a6283< /gmap_id>< Rate>

Thi is one of the best gyms I ve been to and been part of. I ve recommended it my military friends, friends who just want and aerobic condition class, to my friends who are looking for something dynamic, because the place is super diverse. My favorite class is f9ght build with coach Andy. This class alone is worth the price, because it feels like you have a personal a trainer,  coach Andy definetly brings out the best of everyone who attends his classes.< /review>

Not the greatest place ever...staff was ok. Most of them didn't seem like they cared very much. I would always be in the morning classes and I felt like they wished they hadn't gotten out of bed that morning. Also BE CAREFUL WHAT PAPERWORK YOU SIGN. They have the absolute WORST contracts ever. They convinced me to sign the 2 year deal, saying that it was really easy to get out of if I didn't want to participate anymore but I needed to get a new ID to say that I had finally moved out of the state. Incredible annoying. Your best bet is to try another place. Just my 2 cents of advice...</Review>

State of the art facility, extremely spacious, clean, all the equipment is nice and new they are constantly updating and adding new things to make the gym even better (if that was even possible). They have some of the best if not the best coaches in the game, they are walking encyclopedias of fighting knowledge with decades of fighting and training experience.  If you train here i garentee that you will not regret it its physically impossible not to get better. By far the premier fight gym in san diego and one of the top in all of southern california. They really set the bar high.<//text>

I am new to martial arts and I was greeted with first being asked "why would I even want to practice jiu jitsu" and then being told that "typically women do not practice jiu jitsu, out of our 1100 members we only have 20 women and they do boxing or kickboxing."  Ok, cool...Well, i'm not those women. This was coming from the man behind the counter and (i'm assuming) the owner of the facility. After that they decided to inform me that I will be getting sweaty, people will be grabbing me and I will have to make physical and "If I can handle that". I was already nervous and intimidated for taking my first class and to walk into such condescending attitudes was very unwelcoming. And then class began and the coach moved so fast that a new student couldn't possibly keep up or understand, he kept leaving the mat and offering ZERO guidance or help. We began grappling and, again, the coach left the mat with no instruction or no help for a brand new student. Any positive, helpful reputation that the martial arts community holds was completely tarnished the second I walked into The Arena. Needless to say, I will be finding a new gym.<//review>

Since it was a Free Trial, she is a guest, not a paying student. Yet she complains because the Coach didn’t interrupt a busy class of actual paying students just to give her private instruction??? Sorry snowflake, but that’s not the way this gym works. Good luck to her in finding a new gym because she definitely would not have worked out here.'}<//resp>

Moved to San Diego 1 month ago. First thing on my list (after moving out of my car into an apartment) was to find the local Jiu Jitsu & MMA schools. Literally drove around San Diego, and checked out half of the gyms in town.. The focus in alot of the gyms is on the egos/images of the staff members VS producing competent fighters, and providing the most efficient & suitable environment for like minded people to meet, and improve towards higher versions of themselves (most of the places you get plenty of mad-dogging, douchiness, etc)....

"THE ARENA" embodies all the complete opposite qualities.. The focus is where it should be, on the training itself.. Not on how many new membership commissions staff members can pull off in a given day or week.. Mike is a great guy. The place beams positive vibes in & out VS all the passive aggressive posturing stuff. Chris Leben is one of the coaches which speaks for itself. He can choose where he wants to work, and yet he works at "THE ARENA".

Am so stoked, and grateful to have found a new home in San Diego that can facilitate me to grow into the person I've always been intending to become.

This place is awesome all around. Siskel & ebert would have given two thumbs up if they were into man stuff. Total win all around.</review>

< Review>
The training was good but only living in San Diego for the summer caused problems when it came to the financial company that they use, abc Financial. It was a very big hassle that ended up costing me 2 extra months of tuition (when I wasn't even in the area and able to train). That they turn your contract over to a company in Arkansas and that they lock you in to such a long term contract shows that they are not confident that they will retain you as a customer and are looking to squeeze as much money as they can out of you. I will certainly not return to the Arena when I return to San Diego in June.  I am also very specifically talking about the Arena MMA, not some other BJJ school as I see that they have already tried to conflate that on another user's review. That conflation is just another sign that they are not honest people and I definitely don't recommend doing business with them.< /Review>

Jiu Jitsu review:

A lot of people to train with, who have a wide range of skill levels. Baret Yoshida, taught there when I went. Incredibly skillful and teaches solid techniques.

My background: Wrestler, coach, Blue belt in jiu jitsu, I have trained at many different gyms and can tell which ones are good.<//text>

I trained here for one day, had a family emergency which caused me to have to move back to Florida.  After sending abc financial everything they asked for they still sent me a bill for $1700. Thank you arena for putting me thru a year long hassle and charging me for 2 years after only attending 1 class.< /Text>

This place is as good as it gets. Whether you are already a competitor in MMA/boxing/Jiu Jitsu, or you are starting from the ground up, this place covers all the bases. The instructors are world class, and it is not uncommon for you to be training with professional and amateur athletes in combat sports. I do the boxing and jiu jitsu classes, and the amount of technique I have learned in the time I have been training there is amazing. There is also a separate building for strength and conditioning  which has all the equipment needed to supplement your fight training. Coach Andy, who is in charge of the strength and conditioning program, is one of the best personal fitness trainers around, and I would highly advise checking out his classes too.< /Review>

You wouldn't believe what you have to do to quit this place. You have to send in a hand written letter to a third-party company 30 days in advance, and they charge you a $50 cancellation fee. I had to be on the phone for an hour to find this out after they kept charging me after my contract was up. This is the most shady place; DO NOT TRUST THESE SHADY CON ARTISTS - YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED! DON'T BECOME A VICTIM LIKE I DID! All the positive reviews are fake; they make their members leave positive reviews to get a discount, but in reality it is still a total ripoff. I am out so much extra money for no training (the guy told me my membership expired, and then another guy says it is still active and I'm being charged another month). They really do not care at this place.</Text>

I've now been training at The Arena for over four years. Simply put, it's changed my life. Whether it's Vince Salvador, Baret Yoshida, Charles Martinez, Kru Mark, Coach Andy, Jake Mapes, Joe Vargas, or Jesse Taylor you are getting the best trainers period. Even the front desk guys like Jamarr always have a positive attitude and remember you by name. It's a true fight gym to it's core, with a family atmosphere and ego's checked at the door. I'm just happy to be there.< /text>

I have been a member here for a year. This is by far the best facility I have ever trained at. Huge gym, super clean, top level coaches, tons of classes, plenty of parking. Best jiu jitsu program around. Baret Yoshida, Jake Mapes, Johnny Billingslea. Not to mention all the amazing training partners and friends i have met here. Would definitely recommend!</review>

The Arena is the best gym I have been to since I've been training BJJ and Muay Thai. I've been training on and off for 5 years and have been to more than 4 schools. I feel like this one will be my home. The main reasons why I chose this gym over all others in San Diego, are the schedule, cleanliness, level of instruction. Also the friendship and comradery among the students and instructors. They offer well over 100 classes a week, which will work around any ones schedule. Hygiene is so important, once I finish rolling at the 12pm BJJ class, someone is bringing out the mops and cleaning the mats immediately. Last thing are the instructors and other students. I primarily go to Master Baret's and Professor Mape's classes, and I've made huge strides in my game. Placed at a local tournament and wouldn't have done it without them. I also took a few wrestling classes with Jesse and a Muay Thai Class with Vince, all of them were eye opening, and I learned so much. Not much else to say, other than if you are on the fence give The Arena a shot. Thanks for reading my review, hope it helps!</Review>

Let me start by saying that I STRONGLY recommend this gym!

I visited "The Arena" a few months ago on a business trip based on the recommendations of quite a few people I'm near and dear to. As soon as I walked in, I was greeted promptly and given a tour by a gentlemen who I now consider my "brother in arms". The facility was clean, roomy, but most importantly, it was ALIVE! You could feel the spirit of dedication and discipline in the air and the sense of commitment and teaching was very much alive. It didn't take until the end of my tour to figure out that this was the gym for me when I was to arrive.

I have been going to the "Fightbuilt" class (Coach Andy is freakin phenomanal!) and have met up with the Boxing coaches and it has been just sheer honor to be here with them. They're not only knowledgable, but vastly experienced in the art they concentrate in. For that matter, if you take the time to read all the bio's on all the outstanding coached here, you'll find that they're all the best you can get for the price you're paying. At a value level, you could attend all their courses every month or just one and you still pay the same price. This is a tremendous opportunity for you if you want to truly better yourself and surround yourself with people who will push you beyond what you think you are capable of. Do yourself and the people you care about a favor and sign up, show up, and learn!

I'm glad I signed up and look forward to everyday just a little bit more now knowing that I will be challenged and made stronger (iron sharpens iron)!

I ONLY GAVE THE ARENA FIVE STARS BECAUSE OLE GOOGLE WON'T LET ME GIVE THEM 11!< /text>

This is a fantastic gym.  Wonderdul staff and world class instructors.  The jiujitsu program is lile none other and its lead by the legendary Baret Yoshida.  The staff ontop being awesome people and great helpers, are also knowledgeable about martial arts and almost all of them train.  All in all this is a wonderful place to train and a great family and i plan on training here for the rest of my life.</review>

Ill keep it short and to the point, and Ill speak only about the jiu jitsu program since thats pretty all I train in. This by far the best gym I have set foot in, and Ive been in alot of gyms since i travel alot and drop in gyms in la and san diego, so the main thing to look for in a good bjj gym first and foremost the coaches. For anyone who doesnt know, the legend Master Baret Yoshida heads the bjj program, as far as coaches go he's one of the best out there. There is also coach Jake a high level black belt and coach Johnny a high level brown belt soon to be black belt so whenever the hell you wanna train in the week there is probably a bjj class. So next is training partners, you got some of the coolest laid back killers in bjj here. Alot of competitors as well as casual rollers, but competition is big here so be ready to at least compete or be in competition level training classes. Matt space is a non issue here as it is in other gyms, you got tons of matt space and even a cage to have some private rolls in. Very clean as well, and staff is the best, very cool approachable peeps who also have extensive backrounds in martial arts. So there you go hope this helps u make a decision on joining the arena, oh yea and price is very affordable and u have access to all forms of martial arts we have here from boxing to muay thai and a great strength and conditioning program.<//Text>

I am not from the area but was in the san diego area on business i searched on the internet for mma gyms to train at while I was there and the arena popped up so I signed up for the free pass. I was later contacted by a staff member who i told what i was looking for while i was in town and he was very excited to have me come in which in turn made me excited. So i come into the gym which was well put together and very clean (which is big in my book) i showed up a lil early just to get a feel of the place and as people started piling in i was greeted by everyone like they knew me and id been training there for years very humble people of all levels and experience the teaching was very good and detailed orientated had a blast and will be making the trip down here just to train again real soon</Text>

Go down to The Arena and check it out. They're on Sports Arena Blvd in Point Loma. And don't forget to try their FightBuilt and PowerBuilt classes for Strength & Conditioning.

Lots of interesting rocks on the beach and rock formations, small tidepool areas to explore.

During the early part of the day can be less crowded.  Weekends are very busy.< /text>< pictures>

This is a nice, clean, and beautiful beach.
Things to know:
DOGS! YES! AND OFF LEASH so pups will be happy here.
Small amount of parking available.
Parking was free in the 2hr section.
Restaurant at entrance,  a little pricy ,but great. Get the calamari.

The beach is enclosed by rock face hills.
So much fun had here.

You will love it!<//text>

Great public beach and picnic area. There is an off-leash dog area along the beach. Parking can be a challenge during peak hours, so plan accordingly.</Text>

<text>The ocean water was cold today, but perfect for the warm day. We also ate at the Boathouse. They have the best clam chowder. B.L.T's  aren't on their menu but when I enquired they accommodated. The bacon is Smokey and thick cut, the avocado was perfectly ripe. Yum, is all I can say . Beautiful day and wonderful time.<//text>< pics>

<review>Great Dog beach.... Off leash, dramatic cliffs, not crowded. There's a parking lot and restaurant at the north end, a 200 step stairway down the cliff at the south end. Make sure you check the tide tables though, the beach shortens up quite a bit at high tide, leaving less room for the doggos to run around.< /review><GmapID>0x80e915b2b9159b4f:0x2671590cb3c73dbc</GmapID><time>1593372965373<//time><UserId.>115630027673852099033<//UserId.><resp>None< /resp><Rating>5</Rating></record></dataset><record>

It was relaxing and peaceful. We went for a nice walk. Dogs are allowed off leash once you pass sunbathers. I enjoyed the beautiful scenery.<//review>

< Review>
Herbert's beach is one of my favorites. The dogs there are lovely, and their humans are relatively polite. The slough is nasty, (DO NOT GO IN THE POOP WATER) but as long as you keep yourself out of it, it won't bother you (unless provoked). Seagulls are plentiful in case you're feeling peckish (no pun intended. Puns hurt feelings. I don't believe in hurting feelings.). The restaurant smells good, but I only ate there once when I was like 10 so my standards were low and I just had pancakes so I'm actually not sure whether their food is decent or not. Overall rating is an F for 'five-star'.</Review>

I should be clear, this is for the Boathouse Restaurant: I've been coming here for many years, and this was the best experience I have had. We were anxious when we arrived as the beach and the restaurant were packed, and a lot of folks weren't wearing masks. However within 20 minutes (the exact wait time we were told to expect), we were lucky enough to be seated outside the patio area along the walk in front of the restaurant, well separated from other tables and people. We had a surprisingly good, interesting cocktail, followed by an amazing seafood platter...the middle size was perfect for 2 for a meal, and everything was very fresh and delicious. A lot of variety as well...clams, mussels, oysters, shrimp, crab legs, ceviche, poke. My only very small complaint was the amount of lettuce/cabbage the ceviche sat on in proportion to the amount of ceviche. While it is not inexpensive, I did think it was fairly priced for the quality and quantity. Their wine selection was quite good, with some nice and unexpected local selections. We had a favorite Sauvignon Blanc from a relatively small producer and it was surprisingly reasonably priced. I appreciate this; knowing a bit about wine and retail costs, i get very frustrated when restaurants jack up the prices unreasonably high... it's the difference between them selling me a glass or a bottle, so worth keeping the prices appropriate.  The service was really good...our server was experienced, very polite and warm but professional. She was knowledgeable about the menu, and when asked, she articulately expressed her opinions, which I VERY much appreciate in a server who really knows the menu. She guided us perfectly. We also didn't feel rushed despite it being a fairly busy evening. Quite honestly, I've always come here for the location in the past, but after this experience I will be returning more frequently for the food and beverages. Overall an outstanding experience.<//Text>

<text>My dog and I had a blast here. There are both on and off leash areas here. Not too crowded as it's a little out of the way but worth it. The dog wash is not free which was disappointing.  Free parking.< /text><Time>1560737660756<//Time>< GmapID>

Went to the Boat House restaurant here. 2 hour wait which is apparently normal for a Sunday afternoon but it was a nice wait just sitting on the beach. Had a quinoa bowl and it was fantastic!<//review>

<Time>1582092453782</Time><rating>5<//rating><text>This off-leash dog beach is magical. Our dogs loved running in the water and sand; we loved watching all of the dogs have a blast. We got lucky and found a parking spot when someone else was backing out. The dog washing station was a nice touch. Our only problems were that one of the three wash stations was broken and the station we used wouldn’t let us swipe for another 10 mins (we have two dogs with lots of fur.)</text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPSyL-NVYZT51qEoc9nxFavgqX-z_Xc4U4PiM3A=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP-uHNY6W0fzBJKjXXwgRZID3wituCvXlcE0o8p=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

<Review>AWESOME DOG BEACH! You can let your pups run off leash if you walk 100 yards east of the restaurant! This little gem is super worth the drive from Thousand Oaks for us! Both of our dogs love this beach! It's very clean and everyone picks up after their dogs. Pretty much every dog that we've encountered at this dog beach was super friendly too!! 🐶🐕🐩<//Review></record>

A fun beach to hang out at. Small parking lot, a little lookout point, a restaurant and some restrooms, and, of course, the beach. Sometimes it can be pretty crowded, but often as not it isn't, leaving you plenty of space. The water can be pretty chilly, so be prepared for that!</Review>

<text>I grew up near here and spent a lot of time at Hendry's as a kid.  Now i spend a lot of time here with my own children.  We love it here....our "locals" beach.  Also known as The Pit to a of us long time Santa Barbarans.  One side is off leash dog friendly the other is on leash walking.  Lots of tidepools at low tide.  Parking cam definitely be a challenge especially on a beautiful day.  There is a restaurant ( The Boathouse) on this beach which also makes parking a challenge.  Famy friendly beach.  It does get crowded at times but you can usually find a spot even on the most crowded days.  Can be foggy from time to time eben when there is no fog anywhere else.  Can usually see dolphins out in the water, birds diving for fish, etc.  A great local hangout!</text>< Pics>

Hendry's Beach never fails to deliver with the goods everytime I find the time to make it there to get some.  The only real downside is that if you aren't lucky enough to be handicapped and were given the coveted blue tag that hopefully would be hanging from your rearview mirror ready to give you the primo parking spot you deserve... Your stuck circling the lot until some guys feels like he's had enough good for one time and you can have it.

Normally this tends to happen right after the sun sets..<//text>

<Review>(Translated by Google) The beach is not large, the beach is soft, but many plant residues are mixed in the sand, and the sunset direction is slightly off

Very rude owner. Dropped off bike on Sat to fix and told me it would be ready on Wed. I called Thursday to ask if It was ready and he said “Did I call you?”. I recommend you be a little more friendly and have a better attitude. Demeanor is really bad. Smile a little more it won’t hurt you!</review>

Horrible communication from the shop owner. I had dropped off a bike frame to get painted. Down time was suppose to be 4-6 days… I called the shop to see if the frame was ready for pick up about 7 days after drop off. I was told paint was still being ordered. Mind you this was a basic metallic grey color.. Another week passes by and the bike is still not even prepped for paint.. He later told me he was busy and didn’t have time to paint the frame. He should of been upfront from the beginning and shouldn't of been giving me the run around.. Wasted 3 weeks of my time.<//Review>

<text>Very friendly and great customer service! The owner Responded to my email on Christmas Day and looked at my bike the following day. He was quick and very reasonably priced. I will definitely take my bike to this location for any other issues that may pop up.< /text>< Response>

<review>Great small business. Used to live nearby and this was my local bike shop. After, I would never go anywhere else. Even if I lived far away. Hector is knowledgeable, professional, and friendly. He is the cheapest on price and highest on service. Wish Al local small businesses were all ran like Hector's bike shop. Highly recommended!< /review>< Pics>

Hector is a class act. Every once in a while you meet someone who honors people and has passion for what they do. Hector is one of those. He may not be the cheapest or the fanciest, just a good man and mechanic. I would not even think about taking all 3 of my bikes to anyone but him. 10 out of 10 !
Highest recommendation possible!</Text>

I decided to bring my bike that needed some much needed TLC  and Hector went over and beyond. He exceeded my expectations. I needed 2 new tires 2 new rims and 2 tubes as well as some new grips and a tune up. He gave me the best price around and I could not be happier with the result! My bike looks brand new and rides even better! I'm so glad I decided to go with hectors instead of going to these corporate bike shops, I'd rather help out the mom and pop shop any day!<//text>

Such great customer service. Hector wven goes out of his was to satisfy his customers. I've been there two times and brought my boys's bikes. His prices are pretty reasonable too. If you really want a good bike repair Patterson, definitely checked out Hector's! I promise you will not be disappointed!< /Text>

Héctor has the best bike shop in the inland empire. Went in and got my bike wheel trued. Does better work than most shop and charges way less. Will never go to any other bike shop again. Shout out to my sis and Manuel 😎< /review>

<Review>Hector is the best bike shop ever I been to many bike shops but hector has surpassed all of them. I highly recommend you going to his bike shop, no one can repair your bike like hector. He can do more then just fixing them he can paint them, Restore them etc.</Review>< Rating>

<review>Hector's bike shop is a great! I walked in while having some bike issues on our extended tour and Hector was able to get things fixed and us back on the road right away. Also some really neat history as Hector raced bikes professionally in Central America. Highly recommend!< /review>< pictures>

My experience was nothing less then excellent... Everyone there has a great attitude and they are legitimately caring about ones needs.
Sector put together a fixie bike for me that is just awesome!!!  I was going from store to store looking for my next bike and could not find it until I went there... Sector designed my bike and it's worth every penny I paid for it... Thank you guys!!</text>

This bike shop is decent the prices are very high though. I came here originally because walmart didn't have the type of tube I needed so I bought a heavy duty tube from Hector. Worked great he even helped me when I came back after having problems with putting it on. There is something off about him as if he has something to hide, anyways the service is decent I'm actually thinking about getting a repair on my front tire today hopefully everything goes smooth<//Review>

This is my 3rd time coming this week  ,it says they open at 11am. The 3 times I came,I either left my house a little bit before 11 or a little bit after ....still wasn't open...Right now it's 11:30 (still closed) they need to be consistent with the hrs or just change it....It sucks. There loss tho cause I've been waiting here for 30 min and I see a lot of customers leaving ...Literally  seen about 8 people.< /Text>

Went in expecting wizard good times! Met Hector or Dr.. PePe as most know him and the rest is magic. Helped me pick out the perfect Huffy and I rode home to Long Beach on it. As I rode away I looked back to see him in the window smiling and waiving to me as I shed a single tear...... I highly recommend this wonderland of bicycle bliss and Dr. PePe's pleasant nature.< /text>

Bought expensive bikes, his and hers, Phat Cycles and took longer to receive than quoted.  Then the guys bike tires started splitting.  Hector said it was the sun but explained that the bikes were always in garage or inside and the bikes were only two months old.  Since he claimed there was nothing he could do I offered to pay for replacements as riding the bike was unsafe.  It has been two months and still I have not received a call from Hector.  Have driven by four times and he just gives me the run-around.  Don't know why since I was going to pay for them.  Finally fed up went to Don's bicycle on Riverside and they ordered the tires, had them in four days.  As stated in other reviews it is a crap shoot if the store is open, I guess he is the only one that works there.  He closed for July 4th for 5 days.  Don't know how someone can run a business like this.  Horrible customer service.<//review>

Unfortunately I wish my last encounter was as good as the other ones. It started as a repair/warranty on a 2-speed rear hub I had repair a while back when I brought it back for repair in is sat at his shop for about 3-5 months without being worked on, throughout the summer. While it was down I decided to have it panted/powder coated since it was taking so long. I plained taking the parts to a powder coating shop in Downey California and that's when Hector told that the $150.00 I was going to spend on it was to much. This is when I agreed to have one shops he works with do it. Up to this point everything was ok and going fine but, when a time of completion given to me by Hector and was not. I started hearing how he was losing money on this job. Now I did not tell Hector and his son what I was going to pay them they set the price. Now that was one thing. After he did get the parts back from the shop/people power coating it 2 major part where painted the wrong color which would ok if they where going to resand blast the frame and handlebars and paint them the right color but, on reinstalling all the parts/ slap together, done by Hecktor's shop my sprocket was installed backwards, parts at the powder coating shop where lost, bolts were not tightened and there was a chip in my handlebars that showed the old paint. This is why I am giving them one star because a half is not available
In fact after closer inspection nothing was sand blasted and that was part of the  verbal contract with Hector. I thought we had an understanding that ALL the parts were to be sand blasted where is the thumbs down button :-(<//Review>

I bought a bike here and while it was about $100 more expensive than I could've bough online, it is totally worth to try to ride one to see if it’s a good fit for one.</review>

My daughter's battery died. This company was sent through AAA. The driver, Eriberto, was immediately RUDE and loud and acted as though she wasn't who she said she was (despite ID and a AAA member card). I have never had such a terrible experience with a towing company, over a battery jump no less.</text>

<Review>**I WANT TO THANK THESE GUYS** I got my car stuck on a parking block at 3am I was alone and I told them I needed someone right away, they came out so quickly and they didn't charge me.  I was so grateful, thank you to your driver who was so kind and to your dispatcher for waiving the fee and sending someone out quickly. I so appreciate you all!   This was on Sept 5th.<//Review>< Pictures>

Worst experience i have had as a customer in all my years. Dianne at counter made the process very difficult and she claimed i was giving her attitude for asking informational questions. I recommend another tow service or to be very vague when talking to workers there because they seem to make it very difficult and claim that the information they provide, they dont need to provide when they have my property there.</text>

<text>Just be aware, if you get your car towed by the City of Montebello, it's $154. Each day your car is there, you're charged $52. They run a title search and charge $70 for that as well. And don't forget, $223 to pay the city to get it back!

You also have the option to pay $500 in the first 30 days for them to "destroy" (auction) your car off. So you pay them to keep it lol.

If you ignore it, you'll get sent to collections for the amount due, and the amount will increase each day.

Also if you are paying $500 or more, bring cash.

It's a shame it's that scummy of a business, but all of these tow yards are. Hope this helps someone. Act ASAP</text><Resp>None</Resp></record></dataset><record>

He also took the time to explain in detail what needed to be completed and did an excellent job overall in servicing my vehicle.

The receptionist showed up 15mins late. Over 30mins wait time per customer. The waiting area is dirty and they overcharge.

Overall Poor Service.< /Text>

The Monaco is a great place for lunch (it is rarely full). the food is good, not great, and the service is just right. It is also only two blocks from our usual downtown hotel, the Prescott.<//review>

This used to be one of our regular pre-theater spots, and I would have given it more stars a couple years ago. You used to be able to sit in the bar and get some great deals on both food and drinks, but my last few experiences have soured me. My favorite duck pizza was cooked entirely wrong (seriously, the wrong ingredients, and an inedible crust), and the great deals have disappeared. Sadly, my wife, Miranda, and I have been forced to seek out new haunts prior to A.C.T.< /review>

The decor and service here are wonderful.  The food is delicious, well prepared and presented.  The Grand Cafe goes for well executed main stays of French cuisine, like some of the best steak au poivre or duck confit that I have had in SF.  The weekend Brunch is particularly good (and not overly crowded).<//text>

<Text>The Art Nouveau decor is the star here; the food and the service have improved considerably since our last visit.  Large portions of reasonably well prepared French brasserie food.  Good for pre theatre dining.  Very popular, which makes it very noisy.<//Text>< Pictures>

I came here for brunch. I ordered squash soup, trout and my friend ordered eggs benedict. The food was just somewhere between fair and good.

The trout was cooked very well but the flavors fell flat. The soup was just ok--both the texture and flavors were unappealing. Eggs benedict had good Hollandaise sauce but one of the eggs was overcooked (not soft-boiled) and the pork was dry and chewy.</text>

(Translated by Google) I was last breakfast last September. Good quality, great attention and the most beautiful, the place is beautiful, it is worth taking something there only for its building and decoration, modernist style, with beautiful sculptures and fantastic posters, wonderful lamps. I did not have time to dine, I would have liked it.
Worth. 04.09.13

Estuve este setiembre pasado desayunando. Calidad buena , atención estupenda y lo mas bonito, el lugar es precioso , merece la pena tomarse algo allí solamente por su edificio y decoración, estilo modernista , con esculturas preciosas y carteles fantásticos, lámparas maravillosas. No tuve tiempo de cenar, me hubiese gustado.
Merece la pena. 04.09.13

Pete's repair shop does exemplary work.  They were able to do the repair almost immediately and had my vehicle ready and back in action on the road by lunch time..... They were also a third cheaper than 2 other shops I got estimate quotes from.   I willcertainly recommend others to here for cheap fast and reliable same day service.  This place is a bit hidden away down a side street in almost like a strip mall type businesses very little to no advertising for this place i believe all business done is most likely word of mouth!!</review>

Always reliable, professional, helpful and considerate of all situations. They always did good work on my trucks (3 trucks lol) and I keep going back to them if I needed any auto repairs to be done. Very respectable people from the owner to the employees. Very honest with their work and will always give you the best and truthful advise. And to top it off, their repair charges are very affordable to any budget. Always had a great experience when I  pick up my trucks. Great job, Pedro (Pete) and yours workers!!!!

< review>
About 2 weeks ago I was with my family and we were driving from Idaho to California to visit other relatives. We made it to Orange County just fine however, on our way up to Santa Rosa our alternator went out and we eventually had to pull off to the side of the road. After dealing with AAA we were towed to Pete's Auto Repair. From here we met Pedro where he stated that he'd have our alternator fixed in the morning. With no Taxi available, Pedro also offered to give us a ride to a nearby hotel. Turns out that the only hotel nearby wasn't available at that moment because the owner left a note stating they were in the shower. Pedro drove us from Newman, California to Patterson, California which was 20 miles away. From there he made sure we got a Hotel which we did at the Best Western and in the morning he picked us up and drove us back to the repair shop where the alternator was working good as new and the cost was extremely cheap! We drove all the way back to Idaho that day and made it home safely. Pedro you are the man! And Pete's auto repair is an outstanding place!<//review>

<Review>Pete's shop is the best shop you can ask for. He'll let you get the part yourself so you dont have to pay the dreaded markup price that normal mechanics charge. He'll only charge the installation and labor should you have the part and its VERY afforadable. Highly recommend<//Review><name>Soulomind< /name><GmapID>0x8091a24b157fb7c9:0x8960d5c074c7aa26< /GmapID>< Rating>

I am very disappointed with their attitude and treatment plan. I feel like they are looking to extract teeth more than protecting them so they can charge more money to the insurance. I don't recommend this place.<//Text>

Hands down the best dental experience I have ever had. Dr. Pagonis is a magician, I had absolutely zero pain (including the shot) and she did an amazing job on my filling. You cant even tell it's there!<//text>

I just started going to the dentist again it’s been 13 years . They are nicest people ever . Jodi who did my deep cleaning most caring and kindest way possible. I had a really bad phobia of going to the dentist, but I won’t mind going back again. They all take the best care of you. And Karen the care coordinator she always a pleasure to talk to.
Everything was clean and up to date with COVID-19  restrictions.<//text>

They are, by far, the best dentists and hygienists I have ever had in my entire life visiting dentists.  They are soo gentle that I typically get sleepy in the chair, which is pretty amazing in my book.  They are always on time and don't take too long either, even with being gentle and thorough.  I am always amazed.  I will always keep coming back!< /Review><Response>None<//Response></record>

<text>They double charge you. Once direct bill and another to your insurance. Repeatedly! When called, won’t answer the question about billing.

This doesn’t feel like an honest practice.<//text><pics>None</pics>< resp>

Today was my first visit at Cupertino Dental Group. Really great experience. The staff is extremely friendly and welcoming . Doctor Jon is incredible, kind and professional. He listened to me with care and took  the time to answer  all my questions and worries. I have major dental problem and Dr. Jon explain to me the possible options.Think I found the right dental office.</text>

< Review>
I always have a wonderful experience when I go to the Cupertino Dental Group whether it is for cleaning or more serious issues such as crowns or implants. The staff is kind and accommodating. Dr. J.J. Salehieh is the bomb, meaning, he is a very caring, thoughtful, and a forward thinking dentist. I wish I can get more work done on my teeth to further build for the future. I strongly agree with him that flossing at least twice a day, brushing your teeth as many times as you can, and sleeping with a night-guard give your teeth and your overall health a good chance. Dr. Scott Dault, Periodontist is awesome and very knowledgeable. Having dentistry specialities under one roof is extremely convenient for busy folks.<//Review>

Amazing Dentist and Hygienists.  I had a hard time finding a great dentist when we moved to the bay area.  Some seemed more interested in selling their services or finding things that needed "fixing" but not these guys!  They are honest and care about your health not about increasing their revenues. They are all extremely professional, kind, respectful which is also nice to see in the bay area.</review>

For over 25 years, we've experienced the best service at Cupertino Dental. Everyone on the staff is helpful, thoughtful, professional, and just plain good people. My first visit was an emergency, which turned out to be a root canal. I hadn't had dental insurance in years. Cupertino Dental helped me figure out what I needed to do to get back into a regular dental hygiene schedule, and how best to afford it. I'm thankful to the entire staff for many years of great service.< /text>

Dr. Ken, Dr. Nava, Traci the awesome dental hygienist, and everyone else I have encountered there are all very nice, supportive, friendly and knowledgeable.  Dr. Constant did my braces when I was a teenager and a retainer more recently.  They have cutting edge technology and I trust my teeth to them!  I have referred any friend looking for a dentist to this group.  Highly recommended.</Text>< Pictures>

<review>Beyond wonderful!  I have been going here for more than 20 years. I am one of the people who have a "dental phobia" but every single person in this office is so kind and supportive that it takes away my fear. And, the work is done professionally, perfectly, and it's pain free.  I can't recommend them enough!< /review>< Pictures>

My husband and I have been customers of Cupertino Dental Group for 47 years.  Everyone, from the front desk all the way through the entire staff to the dentists are so professional, caring and provide high quality work.  We have never had one bad experience and were always handled with expediency when we had an emergency issue. We truly cannot say enough good things about this incredible team.<//Review>

Great office. Very efficient. Just started with a new dentist, as my favorite dentist, retired. (Well deserved retirement, by the way. He'll always be my favorite)
Love Tracy, my hygienist. Bubbly, fun and thorough.
All the specialties are represented so you just have to go to one office.
Very convenient.<//Review>

If you are looking for a new dentist, this is the place to go.  Their office is warm and welcoming.  The people that work there from the front desk to the dentists are so pleasant and accommodating.  I am not a "good" patient with dental work but they have made me not dread my appointments.  Can't recommend them enough.< /text>

My wife and i have been patients for about 40 years . Cupertino dental group has provided us with the highest quality dental care possible . There services and charges are reasonable and they are caring professionals . Dr Gary (retired) came in on a Sunday at no charge to see my wife prior to a planned trip the next day. His son Alex is an example of his dads professionalism . We would not think of going else where.< /review>

I have been going to Dr. JJ for over 20 years and he is the absolute best. He is not only knowledgeable in his field but also truly cares about all of his patients. I have never come across any other doctor like him. There was a time when I switched insurance companies and his office did not accept my new insurance, but even then I refused to switch doctors. Additionally, his staff is also amazing! I would highly recommend Dr. JJ and Cupertino Dental.<//review>

Check the rates even if you have good insurance.  Exorbitant rates, double what other dentists charge for the same procedure.  Used up my entire insurance limit before I realized what was happening.  When asked why their rates were so high response was "that's just what they are" - when I informed then my family would go elsewhere they still offered no explanation.</review>

You will never find a more caring, patient and responsive Dental Group than these fine professionals. I have lived in SF, the Coast and on the Peninsula and have never doubted traveling down to Cupertino for my dental needs.  They are that good!<//text>

Cupertino Dental always takes care of us and make sure we're comfortable and satisfied. We've been seeing Dr. Ken for 30 years. Now with Dr. JJ, who is great. Dr. VanderKam is our son's dentist since he was 2 years old. She always remembers Mikey and his interests and strikes up a conversation with him.< /text>

Cupertino Dental Group saved me SO MUCH money after it was recommended by another dentist to get periodontist work that I didn't need. They squeezed me in at 7 am, found the real root of the problem (which was just a cavity that had been ignored by my previous dentist for too long) and patched me up in under an hour. The work they did was minimal, which I appreciated because the treatment recommended by the other dentist would require surgery and the risk of losing teeth. I have a lot of anxiety about dental work but they had blankets, headphones, movies and all kinds of stuff to distract me. And Dr JJ is hilarious. They were fair and flexible with the cost too, which was like icing on the cake. The other dentist said the procedure would cost around $2,000 but they got it done for less than half that estimate. Cupertino Dental Group is a smooth operation. Will definitely be back :)< /review>

<Text>I have been coming to CDG for more than 10 years now. I was referred to Dr.JJ by dear friends. JJ is awesome. He is fun, kind, knows what he is doing and a great influencer. I was so scared to go to dentist but J.J., Dr. Konstanz, Marlene changed my whole experience. I went through invisalign, getting an implant and getting a crown with them. All were just excellent. I still dislike the cleaning process but Marlene makes it just bareable through a nice conversation.

I have been seeing Dr. JJ for 17 years and he is the best! I broke my four front teeth out when I was younger and Dr. JJ is a perfectionist and artist who helped create the perfect set of teeth for me. I also love my hygienist Tracy.<//Text>

< review>
I had  some tooth pain and came here because they took they crummy insurance I had .They checked me and the first thing they wanted to to do is do a complete panorex . I said I just have pain in one area ,And I do not want the extra X rays to my head  if not really needed . So I refused and they said that can not do a diagnosis with out it said fine and left I have had many older very experienced dentists before that did not need full mouth to check a problem with a tooth   I week later I came in for a routine cleaning because of the same insurance I had. first thing they said I should have a panorex . For a cleaning , what a joke ? I said NO ! I had to fight with them to get the cleaning with out X rays .This is a factory , they do not care if they over expose you to x rays as long as they can get there X ray money and or they can try and find something wrong in you mouth so they can up sell you !  The employees appear to be young and only do as they are told with no concern for what the patients opinion is. Yes its my mouth and I make the decisions about it not YOU !</review>

Dr JJ. Salehieh is an excellent dentist.
During my dental work, (Two Crowns) He left the room and came back about 5 Min. later. He said that his professor told him that no mater how happy you are with the results of the work you are doing, walk away and take a break, come back and re-examine the work. You will be sure to find flaws that you did not see before.
First off, hearing him tell me this put me at ease. He did find issues that still needed his attention to bring it to his liking.
He is very personable and listens to you.
He has a very stable hand and he cares about doing a great job for you.
Wow, that's only about 5-10% of the dentists out there.
This one is a keeper.
His assistant Sandy was also great and they worked well together to make my experience in the dental chair as comfortable as possible.
Thanks Dr J.J. and Sandy for the excellent work.
See you again next time.<//Text>

I have been going to Cupertino Dental Group since 2006 and I had nothing but wonderful experience. Dr Alex Pagonis is a very knowledgable, thoughtful and gentle dentist which are the key qualities I look in my DDS. Highly recommend it!<//Review>

<Rate>5<//Rate><review>Dr. J.J. Salehieh has been the best dentist I have ever had!   A previous dentist back in Los Angeles did some work including some crowns that started leaking after a small number of years, and JJ fixed me up!   I have now been with JJ since 2014, and his work has been impeccable.   He inspects the work of his assistants and then touches things up much more so than any previous dentist I have visited.   He made sure the fits are perfect and comfortable.   He also injects just the right amount of pain killer so I don't feel anything and at the same time it doesn't stay too numb for too long.    He also has an amazing personality.   After finishing up a cleaning session or any work we will chat briefly about interesting topics of mutual interest such as space exploration, global warming, and the possibility of alien life.   I have never had a better experience with any dentist, and it is sometimes a fun thing to look forward to when I go there, whereas in the past I had dreaded going to any other dentist.   He also improved my gum health considerably through cleaning, suggesting tools, and instructions on what to do at home.<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None<//Response>< Gmap_id>

I had had some pretty bad experiences with dentists prior to going to Dr. JJ. I use to dread getting my teeth cleaned and things just seemed to be going downhill. I went to Dr. JJ for a second opinion on some work I needed to have done and the difference was night and day. Dr. JJ is exceptional and his hygienists are skilled and effective. Since changing to Dr. JJ, I no longer dread my visits to the dentist and my teeth and gums have never been healthier. I can't say enough good things about the team!</text>

<Review>I'm 2nd generation going to Cupetino Dental Group, my original dentist was Gary Pagonis, but when he retired his son took over.  I couldn't be happier with the service and how professional Alex Pagonis is.  He answers my questions before I even ask!  If I ever have any type of issue, this group is amazing on providing whatever I need.  I will never go anywhere for my dental needs.< /Review>< Pics>

Extremely well organized and efficient. Prescreening was very helpful. With no appointment was in an out of there in 30 minutes for a Real ID Drivers license and new photo!
That's has to be a record!!
Arrived on a Friday at opening time.<//Review>

We have been coming to the same store, on 17th and Tustin, for 15 years. We have watched people come and go, but all our favorite checkers are still there. Everyone makes you feel like family, they ask about you and what's going on, and really make you feel valued as a customer. It's a great store and has everything you need. ❤< /text><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

Usually great but tonight I parked next to the right entrance and was in the store for 10 min to find that they closed the exit that I had parked next to. So I had to walk all the way around. This is trash management in my opinion< /text>

We stayed in a cabin for our anniversary and it was awesome. The house was perfect. So small but big enough for us. I was able to go for a nice quiet walk and see wonderful sites. The neighborhood is beautiful and shaver lake marina a short drive away. We rented this cabin for 3 days and a boat @ shaver lake marina. Had a blast. I even had time to decorate for a nice romantic dinner for 2. We rented the boat early @ 7am because the later one sold out. So if you want to rent for afternoon book early. It worked out great, the morning sounds were great. Very quiet.. Loved it. All the dishes you need are here. I also felt so safe.</Text>

<Text>I really did appreciate the hard work From the staff. While I was in there for my reservation the phone was ringing none stop. I now understand why it took me a while to get through, but once I was able to talk to someone I got helped by a very nice lady. They have wonderful boats and great prices! I will definitely be recommending this place!!! Thank you!!</Text>< pictures>

The folks at the marina are nice. Normally they have a staff that is well versed and know everything about the lake. This trip, I noticed some less experienced help, although I did see some of the employees who have been working there the past couple of summers. I think part of the inexperience was that the lake unfortunately just opened a couple of weeks ago due to the Governors orders and shutdown of the state.

The boat that we rented was in great shape. The guys that checked us out were very friendly and knowledgeable.<//Text>

<Text>We rented a pontoon boat based on the prices and boat discription listed on their web site. I reserved a 6 passenger boat and was first given a pretty run down 10 passenger  boat. There were only 3 of us so that was a lot of extra boat we didn't want or need. I spoke to them and they put us in a smaller run down pontoon with torn seats and mildew on the cushions, which would have been great EXCEPT, that big boat had an 8 hp motor on it. At top speed we never left a wake. They advertise 20/30 hp motors on these boats which would have been much better. But my biggest complaint is that the people who rented the brand new boat just like our run down one paid the same price as I did but they got to see the whole lake (not just half) much more comfortably. I won't be doing business with this establishments again.< /Text>< rating>

The memories were worth way  more than the price we paid to rent this boat.  $220 / 5 hours  for  Priceless family adventure.
I was able to enjoy a glass of wine while my son drove me around the lake.
We  rented a  10 passenger pontoon boat from camp Edison marina on a Friday afternoon in June  and it was an absolute perfect day. We took aboard 2 ice chests, 4 kids, & 3 adults. The day use area has alot of lakeside  picnic tables and the tress kept the area cool and  shaded.
Yes of course we cut the engine and  anchored in the center of the Lake for a quik 15 minute dip. It was hot and the cool water felt good. Usually I don't have a problem swimming back to the boat, but HERE  I did . There seemed to be a "different kind of under current" going on. For years we would launch and  swim in cottonwood cove (Colorado river). The depth there is more than  100 feet , Shaver Lake depth was only 50 feet, yet I had more difficulty swimming back over to  the boat? The water isn't the  cleanest , but  it didn't leave a "fishy " smell on us, our clothes or towels .
IMPORTANT NOTE :
USE BUG SPRAY
I didn't realize til next day when I kept scratching and scratching how many clusters of  mosquito  bites I had on my exposed body.
*** THIS BOAT HAD ALOT OF COMFORTABLE SPACE FOR ALL 7 OF US.< /Text>

<review>Their prices are better than other boat rentals but in order to make a reservation, you have to call them a million times until they actually pick up the phone, it doesn’t go to voicemail either, it just rings indefinitely until you wanna just give up and pay $500 dollars more to other boat rentals just to be able to talk to someone and get it done.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None<//response><GmapID>0x8095c9e1068b25ad:0xb71e1984441ef7b<//GmapID></record>

<Review>I wouldn’t even consider giving them a star but I have to so I can right my review of the worst experience of shaver lake. Me and my family camp every year this year we chose shaver lake. The first night was actually very nice we had no problems with rangers or anything of the sort. Considering my family is very large we generally have issues of being to loud but we try our best to mind others. When we got back from the water the rangers came to our campsite telling us to quiet our music at 7:45. There quiet time is 10. Then they came back later to harass me and my family calling us crazy and we are replaceable. The two rangers names are Henry and deseree. We tried to be very respectful to them but they were complete jerks. They stalked our campsite all night and gave us like no privacy. They evicted me and my family the next morning. We’ve never had such an experience like this one.</Review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

We called on the phone and were told that we the only boat available was a 10 person boat. However the staff on the phone told us that we could rent a 10 boat just as long as we had two people on the attached inter-tube. However when we arrived we were told that we could not do this. I was very unhappy about how misinformed I was. I hope next time the staff will better handle the situation and offer a solution.</text><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

I used to own a boat but now it's so much nicer to just rent one for a day from here.  Great place to plan an outing with friends (rent a couple of pontoons) and go relax on the lake.  If everyone chips in, it's actually not very expensive.< /Text>

Rented a 12 passenger pontoon and it fit all of us perfectly. The boat ran perfect all day and enabled us to explore all of Shaver Lake. Tons of sandy beach areas to dock and enjoy your own private beach, then head off to cliff dive off some rocks somewhere else, then just float in the middle of the lake and enjoy the view. Worth every dollar. Great customer service. Reserving a boat was a breeze. I'm making this my go-to spot for Shaver Lake rentals. Can't wait to go back and get back on the water.</Review>

<review>The most beautiful and fun lake in Cali! Islands and rocks to leap from, tree swings from tall pines, offroading everywhere. You can camp for free in the surrounding hills and streams. It's not developed so come prepared. Quite a climb up the road from the valley if u have a 4-banger. It's $10 to park at the marina but the rentals are not expensive.< /review><user_name>Simea< /user_name>< GmapID>

I love everything about Shaver Lake so the marina gets a high rating too of course. Also they have a boat gas station.<//review>

< review>
Yesterday, August 27th, we were really enjoying our family camping trip when my 89 year old father became ill. Within two minutes a great Lady, Park Ranger was passing by. She assessed the situation, called 911 and within 15 minutes we were in ambulance on our way to hospital. Had it not been for these great first responders we would not have our Father with us today. God bless you and Thank you from the bottom of our hearts. You have loyal campers now, just need to leave Dad at home. God bless<//review>

<Text>The food was amazing. They make their own chips and they were top notch. We had a burrito, grilled chicken taco and grilled chicken enchiladas. Delicious. Would give 5 stars of it wasn't so cold. Bring a sweater, maybe a light coat. Food came hot but cooled too fast due to temperature inside the restaurant. It was pretty busy on Sunday at noon. They could use an extra server. We were there 1 1/2 hours which wouldn't be so bad if we had warmer clothes. Food so good we will try again.<//Text>< pics>

Great food at great prices! The shredded beef tacos are AMAZING! And the mole sauce on the enchilada's is fantastic. It has a slightly sweet and smoky flavor that goes on the palatte with each bite.  The staff were great too!!!<//Review>

<review>Great food horrible service. The owner should watch the security video from June 24th at 5:15pm. The waitresses were talking giggling and playing on their phones instead of taking orders for food and drinks at the bar. The only reason I gave them 2 stars is because the food is good.<//review>< Pics>

Shrimp cocktail was lacking flavor/spiciness, but had plenty of shrimp. Wife's beans were more cheese than beans and some of the rice was crunchy. Meat could've used more seasoning. Chips n salsa we're good.</Review>

<user>109750739085186878253</user><Review>The only thing good about this place is it’s looks, The restaurant it self was very beautiful and so were the waitresses, but the food was thee opposite.The chips and salsa were not good at all and tasted microwave and had no taste. I order a Cheeseburger, and later (15 minutes) was told that there was no patties. Then I asked for a Chicken quesadilla, my father got beef soup, and as well it had no taste. When we did get our food, it was a different waitress and I was told there were no buns, both mine and my fathers tortillas had dirt from the grill. Very safe to say we will not be coming back.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics><date>1538805893564</date>< rate>

<Review>Long trip home and passed thru looking for something to eat they are open late very happy because me and my family were starving!. Found this place on Google maps. Everyone has their own likes and dislikes and I liked it. Came with my family of 8 and they served us well, we all had the burritos and they were huge. Even the children's burritos were big. Will come again if needing good food on the way home.</Review>< user>

Prices have gone up dramatically and the food quality has gone down even more dramatically.. service was unacceptable as well as paying 96 dollars for 2 children and 2 adults to eat lunch. Asked for a receipt with a breakdown of the charges and was told they don't provide them.
I hoped my 30th birthday lunch would have at least been enjoyable but needless to say it was far from enjoyable.
Lost a regular customer including my family.</text>

The shredded goat taco was pretty good, but the carnitas taco was possibly one of the worst I have ever had....and I've eaten thousands of tacos! It was dry and flavorless. I mentioned it to the server and she told me she doesn't work in the kitchen...as if I didn't know that. I probably won't come back. Too many good mexican restaurants in california, to settle for mediocre.<//text>

<text>Food is alright, but the customer service really sucks waitress are rude they don't have a smile on their face... Other Mexicans restaurant they give you a lot of chips with salsas at the beginning and this Fiesta Mexicana doesn't do that...they could do better<//text><GmapID>0x809142fe886963f5:0x4148e7080cb45f72</GmapID>< Name>

<review>I thought my phone was a lost cause when I left it on the boat and it was submerged for more than half an hour and the touch screen wasn’t working. But these guys did an amazing job within 2 days I got my phone back pretty much brand new and at a decent price as well. Highly recommend these guys!!!</review>< pics>

This has to be the best experience.  They are knowledgeable and friendly and QUICK.  I was given my options clearly and I was able to get my phone fixed within 20 min. There were options and upgrades, but they weren’t pushy. Easy location to get to (it’s in an office building). I’m pleased and would highly recommend.</review>

I was going out of town the next day and needed to get my phone fixed immediately. The whole top left side of my screen was unusable. My LCD was shot and my screen was cracked all over. I got there 30 minutes prior to them closing, the guy finished within 20 minutes. Quick, super cool, GREAT price and professional. THANK YOU!!!< /text>

STOP DOING ANYMORE RESEARCH AND GO HERE, trust me!!!
My phone was completely shattered and the LCD needed to be repaired and I got the cheapest, fair price ever. You will not be disappointed.
Came in and it was ready for pick up literally 20 minutes later. The screen looks completely brand new. I'm very happy!!< /Review>

I’ve used james many times over the years and would highly recommend him to anyone. Without a doubt he is the man to go to if you need a repair, a replacement or a professional opinion. The customer journey is absolutely on point, he’s nailed it. From the moment you send a message to the job completing. He’s quick to respond, honest, diligent and extremely professional.<//Text>

Nathan was extremely quick and professional in helping to help me fix my shattered iPhone 11 screen and lcd. He was also able to fix the issue I was having with my camera. I was able to set a same day appointment and they were very covid safe. Their price was very reasonable compared to other people who I called. He hooked me up with a great case too. The best part is that they have a warranty that comes with their work. Will definitely be coming back!</text>

Great, fast and reasonably priced service by James! He fixed both my iPhone 6 and iPhone 7 batteries. He offered to check my motherboard for problems and fixed my speakers for me even though I didn’t know my speakers were not working well. Highly recommend and would definitely come back again.</text>

Christian and his staff are the best! I take various phones for him to fix all of the time. I get charged a fair price and they are thorough with the repairs. A great shop go to for phone repairs like battery and screen replacements for both Apple and Android. They also sell the latest in refurbished phones too and some consumer electronics. My go to cell phone repair shop - everyone has got to have one!</review>

< Review>
The service I received was  professional. He explained everything in easy terms. Told me what to expect (had to order a part.) Had the phone repaired very quickly after he received the part. Communication was great and fees were reasonable. I will definitely go back for any iPad repair.< /Review>

Had my iPhone X back screen repaired the other day and I realized the bluetooth connection was inconsistent afterwards. I contacted the store again and the owner of the store invited me back to get it checked out and fixed. He resolved the issue within 45 minutes for free (since I paid the other day for the glass). Very respectful and trustworthy repair shop!<//review>

Kahn is very dedicated to customer service as well, always making conversation as he repairs my phone. It's very impressive to watch someone this skilled work like its nothing. He also gives you great advice on how to maintain your phone in order to maximize its life span, as if he's some kind of smart phone doctor. Anything less than a five star rating would be a disservice to the commitment to quality here.<//Review>< pictures>

<review>I requested a quote from 4 repair shops to fix the rear camera lens that cracked on my Samung Galaxy S6. Imtiaz from iPhone Screen  repair replied within 5 minutes with a good quote. The other 3 places replied with higher quotes one twice as much. I brought the phone in the next day and he replaced the lens in 10 minutes and my camera was as good as new. Good service and value. Thank you Imtiaz.< /review>< Pictures>

I had great customer service here and it was so quick. I went in to have my iPhone 7 screen fixed. I wasn’t completely satisfied at first because the new screen had a little bit of a green tint. No questions asked, he redid it that same day and it works and looks great now. I will definitely go back and recommend to anyone looking for a good spot for repairs.</Text>

<review>Highly recommended!  Fast polite skilled helpful service.   My iPhone 6s accidently fell in water.  I retrieved it quickly but neglected to power it off immediately and even tried to charge it (a big no no). It appeared to be dead. I brought it to LA iPhone Repair with the hope that they could dry it out and repair it.  They did dry-out and diagnostics and confirmed that it was not repairable – too much internal circuit damage due to water.       They returned the dead phone to me without even a service charge.

<name>Robert Shope< /name><Response>None<//Response><Review>I'm very pleased with my experience at Los Angeles iPhone Screen Repair IPad Repair. I dropped by to change the battery on my iPhone 8. They told me 30 minutes but they were able to fix it in around 20 minutes! They are cash only but they let me leave my phone for them to fix while I walked to the bank to get cash. Overall a great experience and I will definitely go back with any future repairs.</Review><Rating>4</Rating><Date>1594465903344</Date><UserId.>114951489992977768596<//UserId.>< pics>

This will be short and sweet. I needed an emergency repair of a cracked screen and contacted Mission Wireless. They responded quickly, were able to do the repair the afternoon I brought it in, and got it done on time as promised. This is how it's supposed to work.< /text>

The staff here is fantastic, friendly and knowledgeable for any of your smartphone needs. They have a great selection of phones and accessories and their repair crew is top notch! Also, if you message them on Google they get back to you promptly, even if you bug them with many questions over the course of several days ;) thanks Los Angeles iPhone Screen Repair IPad Repair!< /review>

Nathan was extremely helpful by explaining the help he could provide as well as how best to efficiently use the power usage on my cell phone iphone x.  He changed the battery in my iphone x quickly, 10 times faster than Best Buy could have completed the work!! LOVE IT!<//review>

Had a PERFECTO experience with Nathan and co, my iphone xs was not charging anymore and within an hour or two he replaced the charging port and all running smoothly and faster best of all at a great price. I will be back for all future phone repairs. they do MacBook repairs as well. I will bring in my MacBook screen repair.< /Text>

So here is the thing. The personel is nice and technically capable. BUT:

They don't inform you that the display provided are not genuine apple parts. They use cheap quality display from China that you can buy on alibaba for 50 bucks and charge you almost $400

THE QUALITY OF THE DISPLAY IS REALLY BAD. All colors are riproduced wrong, there is a persistent blue tone covering everything, contrast is way off and too high.

The phone keep returning a "fake display error" in your settings.

Is so bad That if you take photos you don't know if the photo is good or bad.

Worst thing is that I LOST MY WARRANTY NOW on any other phone issue I might incur into.

STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE.< /Text>

I was rushing to get my phone fixed ended up at the wrong repair place down the street as nobody was there I called them and they were kind respectful and helpful. They were able to fix my phone at an affordable and fair price in a beyond reasonable timeframe and I was thankfully able to carry on with the rest of my errands for the day<//Text>

<review>incredible service and support! I went on a cruise and my "waterproof" iPhone XS max was damaged while we were out on a catamaran. I brought my phone in for repair and to recover precious memories from the cruise. Everyone in the store made me feel so at home, and were so supportive with ensuring I got the best deals on parts, working with me and the Apple store, and ultimately I got my photos off the device, had the guidance and information I needed to get a brand new phone from Apple, and honestly couldn't have asked for more from a repair shop. Truly trustworthy and loving people here.<//review><Resp>{'time': 1572847433487, 'text': 'Thanks for the five-star rating.

Recently moved to LA, so didn't know which company to trust for the repairs, so I tried this place out for the 1st time. Great shop I am giving 5/5. Needed a battery replacement for an iPhone 7+. Technician had a great attitude and the work was done in less than 15 minutes and came with warranty. Recommend for your phone repair needs!< /text>

Super quick, efficient, and honest. They told me about the $49.99 promotion but explained it was for the generic screen replacement--I opted for the original iPhone screen for $89.99 which is still less expensive than other services like icracked, and my phone is good as new. Would totally come back when I inevitably crack my phone screen again!< /review>

Needed my camera glass replaced quickly on my iphone 8 screen repair.. The part came after two day, and was replaced in under 40 minutes. Best service I could have asked for in beverly hills. Super friendly service, and very cool looking place inside los angeles. Pricing was also the best I could find in the city of los angeles for iphone repair as well. I will definitely recommend this place to anyone. Thanks guys!!!< /Review>

I had a wonderful experience. I was immediately greeted when I walked in. They quickly replaced my broke I phone 6 screen and identified a poor battery and gave me a great deal on a replacement. I was very satisfied, would recommend to a friend and will be giving them more of my business in the future.</text>

<review>I came in with a shattered iPhone 7 screen on a weekday morning and they repaired it on the spot. It took maybe 10-15 minutes to complete the process. It’s been about two months and the screen still works like new! Great service and fair pricing!<//review></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Needed to repair the back camera screen for iPhone 7 Plus and front screen glass and always viewed these places with a bit of skepticism. Visited iPhone screen repair on a Monday morning and was greeted by James, who was very personable and added to my experience. He gave me a high-level overview of what was going to be don with the iPhone screen repair, how my phone could be affected, and any potential setbacks. I agreed to everything, hande my phone over and brought out my laptop to do some work. 10 minutes pass by and James calls me over to tell me that the repair is already completed and my iPhone screen repair. I couldn't believe it. I had to do my own self-assessment and could not find any flaws. Great iPhone screen repair I am very happy with my iPhone screen repair. Great location near Bevery hills in Los Angeles.< /Review>< pictures>

Went in to change the battery out of my iphone since the battery would die in less than 5 min. The tech was very nice and fast. It only took about 15 min. What I liked is he did the process in front of me and I even got a 5 dollar discount.<//Review>

Can you believe it a brand new iPhone 11 screen repair needed a phone that’s over 1000 dollars. Thank you Apple! Not! Anyways screen repair took less than one hour at iPhone screen repair.

My I Phone xs max crashed after going in the swimming pool with it. Went to Apple they did not of course. Brough it into iPhone screen repair. They said they need a few hours with it. They called me told me what needed to be repaired my iPhone XS Max is working great after a week. I will keep you updated on my iPhone repair. If you are in Los Angeles and need a phone screen repair come here for sure.</Review>

My daughter was devastated that she had dropped her iPhone 7+ shattering her screen. It looked unrepairable. After calling several repair businesses, I visited this place. In addition to replacing the screen, I was interested in repairing the charging port. The technician helping me determined that the port was fine and it was most likely the charging cord. In just a few hours my daughter's phone was good as new. Thank you very much!</review>

I had a VERY bad experience with this location. I called in this morning and I asked the guy who picked up if they can remove the iCloud lock on an iPhone. He said yes and that they charge $50. That sounded amazing to me, so I drove all the way from Pasadena, through morning LA traffic, which took over an hour, to come to this shop.

When I got there, I showed the guy the phone I needed to remove the iCloud lock from and he said something like, “Oh we don’t help with this.” And I asked what he meant by that. He responded that they do not help with anything regarding iCloud lock. They only help with carrier lock, which I know is a completely different thing. I was very surprised and honestly furious when he told me that. I told him that I spoke to someone earlier today and asked specifically if they help with iCloud, and that they said yes. The guy just stood there awkwardly and didn’t respond back.

I was furious. I understand the difference between carrier lock and iCloud lock. When I called in I asked if they helped with iCloud lock specifically, NOT carrier lock. This was a huge waste of time. I spent over an hour driving to this shop and it was just ridiculous. I understand that people make mistakes, but this situation would’ve been avoided if the person who answered the phone understood what I was asking. I could not have made it any simpler to understand. I asked what I wanted, and was told they help with it.

Please make sure your employees know the difference between iCloud lock and carrier lock. This might be a one-off mistake, and they might actually do a good job repairing phones, but based on my experience, I do not recommend this location.</text>

I broke my phone screen over the weekend and was recommended to come here by a friend. In terms of location, it was quite accessible  and just dropped by work to get it fixed. It was fixed in 20 minutes but I told them I would come back after work. Efficient service, thanks</Review>

Requested a quote with iPhone screen repair and literally got a response within 5 minutes! Crazy!
Ended up stopping for an iPhone X battery replacement and iPhone x screen replacement The expected wait time was 50 min because there were 2 phones in front of me. Again, under-promise and over-deliver. I don't think I was there for a full 20 minutes. They were very quick.
In the past, I've had a bad experience with iPhone repair places where they've jacked up my stuff worse than I brought it in but I'm glad this experience was completely different. Highly recommend for any of your iPhone screen repair needs or iPhone battery repair or any iPad repair or iPad screen repair in Beverly Hills or Los Angeles. The gentleman that helped me was super nice and explained to me the warranty and the process.< /review>

I called them at 8:00 in the morning since my phone was out of service and I needed my phone for work that same hour. I was able to get a hold of someone at about 8:15 - literally it took 10 min. to fix my iPhone screen.

This guy is seriously a miracle worker, I didn't get a chance to get his name but he saved me my day and made it happen for me. He deserves to thumbs up!

A+ with every aspect I can think of. Nice, Efficient, and gets the job done. Will be back for something once day.< /Text>< Resp>

Got a text to pick my phone up, they couldn't find the issue and their computer couldn't detect my phone so no charge, thank you!! I was recommended to this place by YY computer, the best repair shop in Oakland in my opinion, and I'd have to say they were absolutely right. If my new phone breaks, I'll bring it here.< /Review>

Ben is just lovely. I had an email problem (not a computer problem), which took 10 minutes of his time to figure out and he charged me nothing. Apart from that, he's a white Frenchman business owner in LA, who loves hip-hop. Talk about diversity. Loving it :)<//text>

I had a iPhone 6plus that shattered days after getting a replacement phone. So I called this place for a quote and the guy was super nice and actually matched the competitors. The phone was fixed in less than 30 minutes. I will come back if it happens again they are great.<//review>

I thought it was dead so I plugged in my iphone xr and gave it a few minutes, but my iphone xr would not turn on. I took it to Apple and they let me know that it would be $500 flat rate to fix my iphone xs and 3-7 business days to fix my iphone xs max. The one issue was that I didn't have a single thing backed up on my iphone xs max. When I got home I brought it to iPhone Screen Repair. They said they could replace the same part as Apple suggested for $200, which to me was more reasonable than the $500. I brought in my iphone xs max for the iphone screen repair. This was a huge help and relief he lower than Apple cost, quick turnaround on my iphone screen repair on my iphone x and having all my data back was the solution I had been hoping for but seemed far from possible. I cannot express my gratitude enough for his patience and determination.<//Text><Rate>5< /Rate>< Gmap_id>

I arrived and was seen immediately by Nathan. He repaired my iPhone 7 and my iphone 8 screen in less than an hour. These guys were beyond helpful with any iPhone screen repair Los Angeles or iphone battery repair los angeles. Nathan, in particular, was very patient and knowledgeable in terms of what my options could have been with my iphone screen repair. I really hope he reads this because he made an annoying situation so much more manageable. I have no doubt in my mind that if it was just the screen they would have been able to repair it at their price point iPhone repair beverly hills.. If I ever have any phone issues going forward, I will be heading over here for my iphone screen repair Beverly hills...<//review>

<text>Great experience at this iPhone repair shop, I’ve been to other repair shops and they are not as knowledgeable as these guys, Ramy help me out fixing my iPhone 7 Plus screen and showed me a great selection of iPhone cases, the one I went with is really sturdy and it feels great in my hand, hope this time I won’t break it but I definitely know where to come in the future if I need my phone screen repaired. Thank you guys. Much better than dealing with the Apple store.

Before I came to this place I tried to go to the apple store for a Walk-in appointment . Told me to wait about an hour . Asked about email and said that they gonna notified me. I asked representative to update me trough text message , he refuse to take sell phone number - said just check email address.

2 hours waiting and no message came. Than they told me that I should have notifications on my phone and since I didn’t show up they canceled my appointment . Waiting here again.

Thank you for service .< /text>< pictures>

Highly recommend iphone screen repair.
I went in for a iPhone 7 screen replacement after cracking the entire screen. I reached out online for a price quote to fix my iphone screen repair and my iphone battery and got a response within the day..The iphone repair took 30 minutes. To my horror part of the iphone screen started displaying vertical lines and lost responsiveness in those areas.It's been 2 months and I've had no problems so far. The person who helped me was really nice and professional! Excellent communication! I'd recommend after getting your screen replaced. Might bring in my ipad screen repair soon as well.<//Text>

Had a nasty fall and of course my iPhone screen went bye bye. The entire iPhone screen went rainbow colors. iPhone screen repair told me that is Lcd damage on my screen. Fixed my screen and got a new screen protector for a damn good price. Woo hooo thank you iPhone screen repair.<//text>

I called them at 8:00 in the morning since my phone was out of service and I needed my phone for work that same hour. I was able to get a hold of someone at about 8:15 - literally it took 10 min. to fix my iPhone screen.

This guy is seriously a miracle worker, I didn't get a chance to get his name but he saved me my day and made it happen for me. He deserves to thumbs up!

A+ with every aspect I can think of. Nice, Efficient, and gets the job done. Will be back for something once day.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None</Response>< Gmap_id>

My son broke his iPhone 6S Plus .. then the day before I was about to fix his, I dropped my IPhone 7 Plus .. such bag luck right. Well not really .. Lugo and his boss .. very nice and friendly .. very mild mannered was able to fix them both .. knowing how frantic I was .. and realizing my bad luck .. not only did he fix them both .. he gave me a few bucks off for doing both.  Thank you .. my luck just changed . 5 ⭐️<//review>

Hope I never have to come back here for a repair. But if I need my iPhone XR screen repair or if I buy the new iPhone 11 pro max any time soon I know where to go for the repair.</Review>

iPhone 7 glass and lcd replacement in 20mins, they gave a lead time of 45 mins to an hour . Also more reasonably priced then other area repair shops. This place is great! I will, if needed, use them again!</text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><review>Professional & sincere techs to work with. Cracked my screen on my way to work and they did a super and quick repair on my iPhone 6 Plus - Screen fix in less than 15 min! I was really impressed because I thought this phone was done with since the touch didn't work. I was surprisingly incorrect. Its worth having a friend do a quick search on google and yelp for an iPhone screen repair in my area.

Def. a five star. Hope not to drop and break my iPhone again but if I do or know of anyone with a smashed face these people are #1.<//review>< Pictures>

<review>I went in to get a phone fixed, but was told that the person who gave it to me ripped me off; and was no way to unlock it (Apple Unlock), but Eli was able to get me an iPhone in less than 5mins for a good price. He put the old chip inside the new phone and it work as I walked out the door. Made the day much better instead of me running around all LA.< /review>< Pics>

<Text>Went there just to price how much it would be to fix my cracked iPhone 6 screen and the technician negotiated a price better than Apple Care was offering. He fixed my phone in 10-15 minutes and I was out! I highly recommend coming here if you looking for a phone screen repair. Great job and great service. Thank you!</Text>< GmapID>

My go-to place for all my iPhone mishaps!
Yes the pricing is competitive and the location is convenient, but their awesome customer service is truly what makes this place stand out from the other guys.
Brought my iPhone 6 in today for an LCD screen replacement and a battery change and was out in less than 30 minutes. While they were at it they also got my home screen button fixed. OK now I need to tell you I have been living without that home screen button for the past year and I have been hesitant to get it fixed because I am one Big Lazy Scrooge. So when someone finally offers to fix it for you with no additional charge you just feel like humanity is still alive somehow.

Looks like I can keep my phone for another year or more. And note to y'all: don't try to be cool and go hiking without using a case for your phone, OK!!?? You are supposed to go out there to be one with nature and not to agonize over some shattered iphone screen. You will ruin everyone's mood.

Highly recommended!</text>

Just took my iPhone 5 there and they replaced the cracked glass super quick. I think it took less than 5 minutes! They also recommended tempered glass. It's a little thicker but feels stronger than the regular glass. Think I'm going to like it.< /Text>

<Text>IF YOU EVER NEED AN IPHONE REPAIR IN LESS THAN 20 MINUTES, COME HERE!!!!!!!!

Just typed in iPhone Repair on google and this store was the nearest.

My boyfriend and I walked in & the guy at the store was really kind. He fixed my cracked iPhone 5s in literally less than 20 minutes :)

My iphone screen went from majorly cracked to a super smooth, clean screen!

It was $90 but I checked in on yelp & got $10 off!!!! :) so it was $80~

I highly recommend this place to everyone! I will definitely come back if I have a cracked screen again! You should come here too :)</Text></record></dataset><record>

I posted a review on yelp and i will do same here cause they did good job and earned the praise. t's been a while since I wanted to take my time and share my experience with others. This is a no brainer though, I don't remember last time I was satisfied so completely.
So I dropped my iPhone 6s and it wasn't my new toy anymore. Just an ugly phone with broken screen. Of course Apple charges way to much for their services, so I had to find a place that offers quality service, but doesn't charge outrageous prices. LA iPhone Repair & Unlock Center, caught my eye, for having so many reviews on Yelp, so I decided to use their services and I couldn't be happier. Tech guy new his business and answered all my questions. The replacement parts they use are original, not some generic knock off brand. The whole process took around 35 minutes, price was very reasonable especially since they provide 30 day guarantee, which to me is very important.
Bottom line is that I found an excellent local business, which I would recommend in a heartbeat to friends and family. Thank you for doing such a great job guys!<//review>

So helpful, I had come down to LA for the holidays and had a really badly cracked iPhone screen, found them on Yelp and called the number leaving a message.  They immediately called back, were professional courteous and helpful.  Great centrally located, easy to get to.  They fixed my phone is less than 20 minutes.  Couldn't recommend them highly enough.<//text>

After I had my cracked phone screen repaired, a google review was left in my name THAT I NEVER WROTE. These guys clearly stole my information. When I called and confronted the store, instead of denying my accusations, they offered money or store credit. I don't know what other information they stole and am very unsettled by the whole situation. I implore everyone to STAY AWAY from these untrustworthy business owners, whose honesty and dignity is apparently worth less than a positive google review. Also, the glass they repaired the phone with has significantly worse touch-sensitivity than the original.< /Text>

No Stars.  Bad Biz.  They replaced my son's screen with a cheap LED that died 2 weeks after their meager 30 day "warranty." Wanted full price to put in ANOTHER cheap LED. I plead with them to do the right thing and not hide behind their "2 week" defense.  The best they offered was to charge me ANOTHER $79 for another cheap LED (which they claimed they'd stand behind for 6 mos.)  Zero good will. Will not do biz here again.  Encourage others to avoid at all costs!  (Will also be checking with new repair facility to be sure no other parts were swapped out).</review>

<Review>My phone was bad I went to  Apple store (already a nightmare usually inside malls ) Apple store wants to make appointments,  Apple do not care about your time, so they say to return another time, they are complete unprepared for the quantities of iPhones they put out, they don’t care at all, so to shorten I came to this shop at door with no appointement, the technician fixed my phone right there simple like that, we should pay more attention for the local commerce, to people that really care about us. Thank you iPhone repair.</Review><gmapID>0x80c2b9f03f6f03a7:0x429b7c07d48f4ac3< /gmapID>< Response>

Finally found a store that would fix my iPhone 8 cracked screen repair! Called everyone and no one had this screen in stock or open on Sundays. They did it for half the price of the Apple store and it looks great!< /Review>

<Time>1512497382769< /Time><review>After I had my cracked phone screen repaired, a google review was left in my name THAT I NEVER WROTE. These guys clearly stole my information. When I called and confronted the store, instead of denying my accusations, they offered money or store credit. I don't know what other information they stole and am very unsettled by the whole situation. I implore everyone to STAY AWAY from these untrustworthy business owners, whose honesty and dignity is apparently worth less than a positive google review. Also, the glass they repaired the phone with has significantly worse touch-sensitivity than the original.</review>< Name>

<review>These guys know what they are doing.  I was in and out of the store in less than 15 minutes.  They replaced by iPhone 5 glass, which was totally shattered.  Looks like new now and works perfectly.  Prices are also very reasonable - only $59 to replace my screen (Apple Store wants $79 to replace a shattered screen and that's only if you have AppleCare...otherwise it is much more expensive at Apple Store).<//review><rate>5</rate>< pics>

YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED,
The extent of Joey's cell phone knowledge doesn't seem to extend beyond the most current iphone release.  In terms of cell phone ownership, if you're someone who is less concerned in keeping up with the  Joneses, I would seriously reconsider giving this place your business.  By merely admitting that he isn't as well rounded in all aspects of cell phone repair as he'd like the customer to think, would've saved me a lot of time and aggravation.  Overall, inferior customer service, lack of follow through and lousy store presentation.  Oh yes they post their own reviews to make it look like a legit place!!!!!!!!

The best piece of advice that I can offer to someone in need of a cell phone repair is not to settle for the lowest bidder, you get what you paid for and to SHOP AROUND taking note of the different price quotes offered.  It will empower you all the more especially since the guys who work behind the counter in stores like these don't post signs with price breakdowns, if you know what I mean.  AVOID AT ANY COST.<//Text>

<Text>My 2 year old son threw my wife's phone in the bath tub. The phone stopped working and I was afraid we lost all her information and contacts.

<Review>ALMOST ALL OF THE 5 STAR REVIEWS ARE FAKE
Please read:
When you bring your device in for repair, they steal your the parts within the device and replace it with junk that breaks down not too long after. I gave them a device and after a month it slowed down and eventually SHUT DOWN. Take a look at any of the REAL reviews rated 1 star. Those are the actual customers. They all say that their device stopped working as well.

The bottom line is DO NOT COME HERE!!!<//Review><user>109183775107641478317<//user>< resp>

< review>
Took my phone in for screen replacement on an Iphone 5s. My assistant went in for me and the first one came back with a line all the way through the screen. I said that wasn't going to work so he took it back and when he came back it had a new screen with a small line in the left side. Since my assistant was fed up I went in and they said that they couldn't help me. He was waiting on a new shipment to come in next week. After 2 weeks still no new shipment and my screen went completely black. 100% unusable. They couldn't fix it or even give me my money back. I had a friend put an original broken apple screen back in and also replace some screws that were missing??? I had to take the phone in to Apple and replace the phone, since they broke my phone while trying to replace the screen. Total amateurs, they just take your money and give you crap. You're better off throwing your phone in the ocean and buying a new one.. Never once was I offered a refund or anything.< /review>

Worst place ever! When they replace your phone screen the screen they replace is not a new one as you would expect since your paying for it, rather it is a used one that was removed from an older phone and now being put on yours. I DON'T recommend this place to anyone but if you decide to do business with them make sure you look at your device carefully and that everything is done well. Other than that stay away from this people its not worth your time or your money.< /Text>

Happened to drive by this location and remembered that my cracked screen was on my to do list. Convenience spot located on Pico blvd. Just west of Robertson blvd.

They fixed my iPhone 6 screen in 15 min.

Everything works perfect and I grateful to them. I also have a shattered iPad 2 with a cracked screen in need of a repair.

Two thumbs up for fast service. My go to guys for any cell phone repair !!

My go to guy for any apps product repair !
By far the cheapest iPhone screen repair in Los Angeles !!

Back here again with an iPad Mini that had a cracked screen and a broken LCD.

THEY FIXED IT THE SAME DAY - two thumbs up!<//review>

<text>DONT GO ANYWHERE ELSE!!

Fixed my cracked iPhone 6s screen in 10 min while waiting. Brand new LCD and screen. Definitely the best iPhone screen repair shop in Los Angeles.

I have an iPad screen that needs repair and they gave me 50% off my next repaid + they gave me 30 warranty on all parts and labor.

Nathan is so kind and really cares about customer service. I will never go anywhere else to fix my iPhone or iPad again!!!< /text><user_name>Johnathan Shwartz</user_name>< Date>

I took my iPhone 5 & 4 to have the cracked glass repaired. I was verbally quoted q price to fix the 5  and they had the screen fixed in about a hour. The 4 he told me would take a few days. At the moment I was happy because the 5 is my primary phone.
A two weeks go by I hear nothing from them so I stop by, iPhone 4 still not fixed. "come back in few days. Another two weeks goes by, during this two weeks, I drop my phone for the FIRST TIME since it was repaired, and it cracks again!!!! Totally unhappy!!! I go back and my 4 is STILL not repaired, and they want to argue with me on how bad their after-market products are. We finally come to a agreement on a price to repair glass for the second time. The fix the 5 and give the 4 back unrepaired, and not put back together.
That was two weeks ago. Tonight, the screen for the 5 cracked again on the first drop.

TOTALLY UNHAPPY WITH THESE GUYS. I'VE WASTED OVER $230, AND I STILL HAVE A CRACKED PHONE.<//Review>

<text>Highly recommended! They were able to repair and replace the screen on my iPhone 4S quickly. Great work - superb workmanship! Joey and the other gentleman are the people to go to if you have any issues with any of your cell phone problems. I also got my iPhone factory unlocked so I can use it with a sim card in Europe for a trip and it worked perfectly through out my trip. Call them if you have any problems with syncing your iPhone iPod or even iPad - Best service yet!

Thank you for all your help!

Wow!!!!!!!!!!! This place is a dream. I went in today to get my iPhone 6 plus repaired because it was cracked so bad I couldn't even FaceTime. (There was a crack through the camera) he told me it would be 20-30 minutes and he was done within 5-10 minutes. I cou don't not believe it. On top of that he was nice and funny and when I asked him about an iPhone case to protect my phone, he was honest with me about where I could buy one nearby instead of trying to get me to buy one there! But they also have a great selection!! Rockstars!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</Text>

Muy, muy, muy bueno!  Extremely knowledgeable technician.  Willing to stay open late or arrive early to get you out of a jam.  iPhone 7 Plus repair?  “No problem”, he says.  Really knows his stuff, so the results are fantastic, the price is affordable, and works hard to earn your business.   A+ all around.</review>

Needed another phone so I came here. I bought a iPhone 5c and I also purchased their service with a brand new number. They gave me a pretty reasonable price of $180 and now that I think about it I didn't get a receipt and the several times I've been back in there I've never seen him give the customers a receipt either.About a week and a half later my phone was malfunctioning and I couldn't receive or send out. I took the phone back up to the shop because I was unable to call or text. They told me okay we will check it out for you give us a few days and we will get back to you. A whole week passed. I called they said they are still working on the phone. I said okay. Two weeks passed I called again they told me the same thing and I asked well do you know what's wrong with the phone? They gave me the same response as the first time I called. I spoke to my friend about what the phone was doing and he told me he has experienced something similar but it ended up being that the phone was stolen. That definitely made me wonder if the phone I purchased was stolen. I called countless times and kept getting the same response until one day he told me that he sent the phone off to his guy to take a look at it. Called about three more times after he told me that and said his guy still has it. This was January 1st when I purchased the phone and had it until the 11th of January. It is now March 7th. So it is March 7th... I still don't have the phone nor do I have the $180 that went down the drain. What do you guys think?< /review>

<date>1456296084605< /date><Rating>5</Rating><text>I was very skeptical at first with all the mixed reviews, but the quote I got over the phone was better than all the other I got, so since I'm also short on cash and these guys are closer to my house, I decided to just give it a shot.

Yes, the place is dirty right now, but it looks like they are remodeling since they have contractors working and building a wall....

While I was there another customer came in and started yelling that her screen doesn't turn on anymore. Then the guy asks how long ago did u have this screen fixed here? She's like September! That's like 5 months ago... And she expects them to fix her iPhone for free?! I guess most these bad reviews are from customers like this. I mean what if she dropped it the night before or dropped it in water she expects them to fix it?

I understand 30 day warranty, which is what they told me they offer, but 5 months? Cmon now...

Pay CASH if you don't want to pay tax.

Overall, I recommend this and would to my friends and family. Might have to bargain a little, but the price can't be beat!

I have a iPad Air that also needs repair because it has a cracked screen, so I talked to the guy at the store about bringing it in and he gave me 40% off the iPad screen repair.

Thanks los Angeles iPhone repair, they're really in Beverly Hills right next to me house!<//text>< pics>

Wow!!!!!!!!!!! This place is a dream. I went in today to get my iPhone 6 plus repaired because it was cracked so bad I couldn't even FaceTime. (There was a crack through the camera) he told me it would be 20-30 minutes and he was done within 5-10 minutes. I cou don't not believe it. On top of that he was nice and funny and when I asked him about an iPhone case to protect my phone, he was honest with me about where I could buy one nearby instead of trying to get me to buy one there! But they also have a great selection!! Rockstars!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<//Review>

I showed up 5 minutes after closing (not realizing they close around 8pm) hoping to have them fix it, and Joey was AMAZING. He not only fixed my screen in 15 minutes, he added tempered glass for extra protection, AND he gave me a small discount because he's just that awesome. I did have to pay via Vemno, which is always kind of weird, but I didn't care at all. The other reviews say it all -- this place is legit!

I'm sending all my friends here and you should too! :)

Oh and just a tip, parking is kinda weird/tough in the evening because of the restaurants, but usually you can just park right out front (blocking others in) while you wait! It doesn't take long!

For sure the best iphone screen repair shop you can find in los angeles! DONT GO ANYWHERE ELSE!<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None<//response><Gmap_id>0x80c2b9f03f6f03a7:0x429b7c07d48f4ac3<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Good smartphone iphone and ipad repair shop

Came here Jan '16 to repair a broken screen on an iphone 6. I was helping out a friend and needed to have this taken care of on short notice.

Overall everything worked out well. I walked in without an appointment, got quoted the cost ahead of time $109 including tax, and 15 mins. Everything was delivered as requested. They are probably the best and cheapest iphone repair and ipad screen repair shop in los angeles.

Service was very good. I appreciated that the rep / repairman was thorough in testing out different functions of the phone in front of me, before and after the repair. He even went over things that didn't seem related like the audio and aux input outlet.

Furthermore, the repair area is right in the open and you can see them work on your phone, should it be any relief to who care.

The only thing I didnt care so much for was the higher cost of parking in the immediate area, but that's not the fault of the business of course.

With good faith, I will return and send buddies of mine here. Highly Recommended.<//review>

<text>BROKEN, SHATTERED, CRACKED OR SCRATCHED IPOD, IPHONE, IPAD SCREEN, CASE OR BACK?

NO WORRIES! The iPhone Repair Center can help!

A co-worker who manages shopping centers found an abandoned iPad with a shatter screen in vacant store. Everything worked fine, but the screen was a mess, with bits and pieces falling off. Also, one corner was smashed and the back scratched in several places.

I replaced an iPod battery once, so I thought maybe I could handle the screen replacement myself. But after looking up an online tutorial, I thought better of it... **Ahem** (intimidating). Plus a new screen (with shipping) is over $90. Definitely better to hire this job out...

A quick Google search led me to Yelp and the LA iPhone Repair Center

The small work space is littered with iPods, iPhones, iPads and replacement parts galore. Clearly the guy's busy and workin' hard. Another positive sign.

SERVICE
Unless I'm misunderstanding their website, they strictly offer Hardware replacement...
* Battery
* Hard Drive
* Mother Board
* LCD (screen)
* Audio Jack
* Face Cover
* Back Plate
* Click Wheel

Not sure this is where I'd go to replace my mother board or hard drive, but what do I know?

As far as my personal experience, I dropped off my illin' iPad early afternoon and they called me late afternoon for pickup (maybe three hours service time). During that short span, they replaced the screen and push button control, smoothed out the smashed corner and buffed out back-plate scratches.

Excellent quality work (the iPad looks like NEW) in short order.

A bargain by any definition!

<Time>1363763327167</Time>< review>
These guys were great! I accidentally dropped my iphone 4s into a pool of water and it was completely water damage . By the time I pulled it out - it was flickering and seemed like it was going to fail on me. I had the immediate reaction to find the fastest and efficient iphone repair store that can get my apple iphone the help that it needs. The right medicine that would save all my info - the information that I have not backed up yet for months. It was a simple call that a gentleman named Joey was of interest to get my phone back to life since by the time I brought it to him it did not even turn on! These people do magic! If you have any sort of problem with your iphone ipod or even ipad I highly recommend them! They are kind and interested in getting your device(s) repaired! A+ Thank you guys!</review>

Great store great people They have a wonderful security dog the tall guy is a little bit annoying but if you have patients  they will fix your phone wonderfully  just wen it comes to paying you want to pay the tall guy because the short guy is stingy and he doesn’t give any deals because he’s Persian the tall guy he’s just annoying but You need your phone fixed so just deal whit the nuisance and you move on Listen I would not invite them to any party but I definitely would and have givin my phone to fix  if you tell  them u will give them a good review they will be nice< /Text>

Took my money, said they don't have the screen for the iPhone 5 in stock.  I trusted them came back in a week. Still didn't have it. Came back a month later and they wouldn't honor it.  He also tried to fix the frame that was slightly bent but left a bunch of dents in the side instead.<//text>

<time>1495654102132</time><rating>1< /rating><review>I tried to return my phone to Sprint and found out that the glass on my Apple phone isn't the original glass. I called and spoke to Aaron and he said that I should have asked about the glass they used before I got it repaired. He stated, " What do you want me to do", he was extremy rude. Buyer beware if you plan to upgrade your phone don't go here, they use the cheap glass from China.< /review>< pics>

<Review>DO NOT REPAIR AT THIS STORE.  WE TRIED TO REPAIR A BROKEN SCREEN.  THEY TOLD US IT WILL BE READY IN 1 HOUR.  THEN THEY TAKE YOUR PHONE AND WILL NEVER RETURN IT.  WHEN ASKED WHY, THE MANAGER WILL IGNORE YOU.  I HAD TO CALL THE POLICE TO RETRIEVE MY PHONE WHICH THEY BROKE.  I WOULD GIVE IT ZERO STARS IF I CAN.

DO NOT GO TO THIS STORE !!!!!!<//Review></record></dataset><record>

<Text>CHEATERS. Caught the owner Joey red handed trying to steal my working screen and replacing it with a non working screen. I called him out on it, he played dumb and pretended it was an accident.
