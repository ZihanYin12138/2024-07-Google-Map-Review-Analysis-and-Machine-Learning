Within seven days of moving in, I have had to call 911 for an irate transient living on my doorstep, clean up urine that leaked in through my front door, and then, ask an unresponsive management to ask my neighbors to be considerate of those living next to them. So far, I have seen no improvement. There are other options less horrible than this one. Take your time and actually see what you're signing up for. Paying exorbitant amounts of money to rent a hovel in Southern California may be expected, but we shouldn't put up with it. The only way to get a rapid response is to be late on your rent.</review><pics>None</pics>< response>

“A series of unfortunate events” is best way to describe living here. If you stay here make sure to never get mail sent to you. Especially packages. Also; don’t leave a bike in the bike room. Oh and just pretend management doesn’t exist here, you’re better off not even bothering them with any of your nuisances.< /Review>

<text>Not a great experience. The other day I walked in to my apartment and found a homeless person staying there. The management and staff were very helpful though.

You are FAR better off living somewhere else, especially in the area, there are SO many better options, just keep searching. I can assure you, you will regret living here. Leasing office is very unpleasant. Packages get stolen often, the lockers don't help. Called to ask about a missing package and they said "probably someone opened the locker it was in, we can't help you" basically they told me to go F myself and stop wasting their time. Really bad, really unfortunate people can be so vile, especially when you pay money to live here. Leasing office always acts like you are doing them a disservice to be in their face</text>

Staff treated my son horribly.  Gave him the wrong apartment the day he signed the lease.  Was rude to him when he went back to tell them.  Gave him another room and said the terms were the same ( I was there and heard it) emailed him completely different terms.  And blamed corporate for the change and there was nothing they can do.  Idk, maybe they dislike military residents? Horrible customer service and it’s clear the leasing staff have no idea what the terms are.  Needless to say, my son canceled with them and is looking elsewhere.<//review>

I lived in IDEA1 for nearly 18 months. The building has a very interesting and modern design to it. And it is build around the work/live concepts. There is a lot to explore such as the roof deck jaccuzzi with very different feel night and day views and an amazing large guest house. The place can easily impress anyone. The use of space inside the apartments is also very forward thinking. It may look small but there is lots of storage space. I was on the fifth floor facing the main hub. I had two plumbing issues in 18 months which were handled in less than 6 hours although they were both in the middle of the night. Aside from all of this, what separates this place from other places is the staff including leasing and management. They are there if you need them and they very quickly respond to emerging situations. I found that to be really the best about IDEA1.</Text>

I applied in January of this year never signed a lease agreement or received a key. They agreed in January to refund my deposit and stopped responding I contacted my credit card company and they reversed the charge until idea1 contacted them with my application as if my security deposit should have been held.

Our experience has been beyond 5 Stars at Idea1 since we first walked into the doors to view the building.  Simon, the leasing agent, was warm, friendly, knowledgeable and showed us a variety of options. We knew once we left on that first visit that we found our home. Once we decided to move in the entire team was so flexible - Josh in the office worked with us to make the transition extremely smooth. I've lived in the Gaslamp for 10 years and this building management has been hands down the best. Lee on the maintenance staff is a joy to be around and is so welcoming.   Throughout the recent Covid-19 pandemic - the leasing management has been communicative, honest and truly care about the tenants.  I've had nothing but great service from Sean the business manager.  This is a wonderful community to live!</text>

It’s the cupboards. I remember moving here and being so excited about how they lifted upward and are slow close (not slow close anymore.) One thing I did not consider when falling in love with these cupboards is that they do not stay open unless you’re holding it. I usually have to use two hands when putting stacks of plates and other heavy things up there. It’s awesome when you have a husband you can ask to hold it open, but when you’re all alone you’re using your head to keep the stupid thing open!!

<Review>I love idea1! It has all the perks of living downtown,  but is tucked away in it's own little sanctuary.
The gym, though not huge has everything you need, and most importantly is property vented.
It's walkable to Petco park! Great for baseball fans,  like myself.
The events are great too. Get to know your neighborhood businesses and your neighbors .. and free food? Booya!< /Review><rating>5<//rating>< response>

The leasing staff was incredibly helpful during the application process (Thanks Simon, Sean, and Tenaya) and maintenance has been very responsive and friendly (Thanks Patrick and David).  I do have two gripes. First, it seems as though you have to personally come downstairs to allow guests up. This seems like a real awkward setup and incredibly inconvenient for tenants. Second, is that one, or some, dog owners allow their to dogs pee in the outside walkways in front of apartments and elevators. I don’t think this is common throughout the building and is probably one disrespectful neighbor on my floor.  Overall, I’m very pleased to be living here!< /review>< rating>

I don't even know where to begin with this review, if I could give negative starts I absolutely would. Not only is the actual structure of the apartment complex super cheaply built (very thin walls, uneven structurally, EXTREMELY LOUD and the hallways/ communal areas are very dirty) but you can tell they cut major corners in order to save a few bucks. As if that wasn't bad enough the property management is without a doubt the worst property management I have ever had to deal with. They are not only incompetent but super unprofessional, it's quite obvious they also have a huge lack of communication between everyone in the leasing office because you get different answers from everyone when asking the same question. They also have been renting out vacant units as weekend Airbnb's without informing the tenants prior to, therefor theirs always random weekend renters. As someone who has been living at this complex for almost a year I STRONGLY advice renting somewhere else.<//text>

Always helpful, kind. Actually cared in my opinion. The others in the leasing office well. There was only one good person there and that was Tanya. I forgot the name of one of the leasing office managers I always hated being in conversation with him was never really helpful at all. No one would respond to my emails when I had a complaint/ submit a job for my apartment until I went down to the leasing office at least twice. I would be told yeah sure someone would come by and help. If I found Lee and spoken to him about my situation I know Guaranteed he'd come by to help later in the day.

<text>MUST READ: Take a look at some of these reviews, most are from other business not actual tenants.

Second, this place is literally a disaster. Every floor is occupied with 4-6 units of air b n b. Which gets loud and unmanageable between Thursday and Sunday! People running up and down Hallways, screaming, ringing doorbells, drinking. I am honestly ashamed to tell my friends and family where I live.

From the exterior it looks cool, when you move in it’s another story. The hot tub is trashed almost every day. Algae build up, beer bottles everywhere. The grills do not function properly “only the front burner works”.  The key area literally smells so bad that people access the building from the West entrance. There is caution tape over the area as we speak.

Tenants complain about their dogs getting sick after using the let area.

You step on dog poop/pee by just walking into the elevator.

Elevators do not work very well, at times you will wait 5-10 minutes for one.

Staff is horrid. The only positive thing is the maintenance crew. I would highly recommend giving these guys the management positions. I can guarantee they would do it better. So far no one in the office can do anything properly. I.E check parking spots, noise control - dogs barking for hours on balconies.

Fire alarms go off at least 3-4 times a month. Various hours, we like to keep it creative at idea 1. Last week it was at 2am. Everyone evacuated.

Walls are paper thin, I can hear my neighbor under me walk... this is just plain weird. Me and downstairs neighbor can hear when we’re rolling our curtains up.

I can keep going but I hope you get the point. For the money don’t do it. You can do waaaaaay better.

I move out end of the month the month and I cannot be happier to leave. This place was truly a disaster. Oh by the way get used to homeless people just randomly sitting in the courtyard hanging out and peeing everywhere, because idea 1 can’t decide if the courtyard is public use or private.

This place is bad, like I’d rather stay at a hostel. At least that price justifies the experience.</text>< Date>

First year was amazing! We rented one of the penthouses and were initially given 2 parking spots (When you normally only receive one spot per unit). As we resigned we were told parking will be limited and we may have to bounce around spots as units filled. One day we come down to someone in one of our spots... there was ZERO communication from management about parking and they gave away one of our spots without any written or verbal warnings, resulting in many problems. We ended up having to find another garage to park in without the help from the property management. Extremely sad in the managements communication and planning abilities. They do not seem able to problem solve and cater to their well-paying residents appropriately. I would not be able to recommend this property to any of the professionals I work with or good friends looking for a good place to live in East Village.</text>

There are great spaces to hang out and lots of events to participate in! The atmosphere is very friendly, and most people are pretty social too.</Review>

Disorganized and poor communication amongst office staff has lead to headaches.
Parking situation is unmanageable. 2 bedroom and penthouse units are given space for 1 car, no matter how many bedrooms, without the option for a second car. Closest alternative for covered parking is several city blocks away in another apartment building's lot.
We loved our first year. Changes in management have resulted in a lot of disappointment</text>

< review>
I actually liked the place until someone BROKE INTO my Garage storage unit...AND STOLE MY CANNODALE BICYCLE. THEY WIRE CUT THE FENCE of the unit to gain access to the door handle. I HAVE NOT EVEN LIVED HERE 5 MONTHS yet.
No security cameras, no daytime security, transients COMING IN AND GOING AS THEY PLEASE.
Get this..management knew about a series of bicycle thefts happening in our complex and did NOT notify the tenants about it.

I was not given any notice to make an informed decision.

Good or bad. The tenants need to know so we can protect ourselves.

If i would have known that, i would have moved my bikes out of there. Yes i had a 2nd bike in there. They took my best bike..both were covered up.

There are lot of things wrong in that inept leasing office. They have an emergency line and nobody gets back to you. I had to physically go downstairs to the office well into the afternoon to see what was going on. I called the evening before.

You handle the emergency calls first. A phone call or email a minute or to to acknowledge the problem.

I sent  followup emails to the PROPERTY  manager and the assistant manager about this incident and what it has done to my way living here. It has been 2 business and no response.

IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MONUMENTAL KNOWING ABOUT THE BICYCLE THEFTS INSIDE OUR COMPLEX. THANK YOU IDEA1.</review>

<Review>Caution do not do business
Desperate to rent and will lie to you
OK, so I went to see these apartments the other day told the people in the front office that I had some challenge credit, they assured me that  If I  filled out the application there would be 72 hours return policy on my money  If the application got declined, once the application got sent they declined my application,OK
so give me my money back right,

well they call me 2 days later say they got it overturned and that I'm now approved.

so me and my family start packing we start to transfer over utilities to the place figuring were gonna be able to move in on the 29th of the month. I get a call today by a manager at the office who says that we are not approved and that it will be 14 days before they set me back my money

It's no wonder they only have a few residents actually living in this complex very unprofessional, don't know what they're doing....
Once I try to express my  Frustration with this manager at the apartment complex she just said OK whatever and dismissed all of my concerns and said well there's nothing I could do, you'll receive your money from our corporate office in 14 days

Thanks idea1

We moved into Idea1 in February and have had nothing but great experiences from day one. While we never had any issues with the previous management, the new management team assigned to the property have been exceptional to work with. Any requests we’ve had have been promptly addressed and they’ve treated us with the upmost respect. The unit we’re in is beautiful (it gives all our visitors apartment envy ☺️) and we’re in a great location. We have a kid so being downtown has been a blast and while there are some homeless persons in the area, security has never been an issue and we feel very safe here. The amenities are great (2 rooftop decks, a clubhouse, an amazing gym space, community areas in the center) not to mention tons of weekly activities for residents like diy events, paint nights and yoga. It’s seriously fun living here. For the price point I feel like we’re getting a lot for our hard earned money< /Review>

<date>1523554764972</date><rating>1<//rating><Text>So I lived in this complex for 4 months and here is what happened to me.

1. TOP DECK: When I first toured the complex the agent told me that it was open for use 24/7. That was not true its open till 10:30. Another is that there is a building in construction, it was up to the 4th floor only. The agent said that it won't go any higher so i won't block the view. A month later guess what? It got higher and blocked the view. What unethical way to get customers.

2. Security: It can't get worse. I had a couple of incidents. Once I was parked on the street next to the building and my window got smashed. I asked the security and they said they dont have cameras outside yet.Then why did you open without cameras? You are in east village. Another thing is that they have a bike rack in the complex so I had my bike locked up there. One night. Just one night later it got stolen. I went to the security and they said no cameras yet inside the complex either! And where was the security??? The thief must have spent sometime inside. To climb the gate and to cut the locks and to carry it outside where was he? I know, if its cold outside I find him just chilling in the gym. Even if someone's working out there. Or one time he was calling from outside because he forgot his keys inside. They're just bad.

3. QUALITY. The quality in the apartments is bad. The floor's get dirty easily and somehow they collect hair. I have short hair and if you look at my apartment you think I had for dog's. I was talking to one of the cleaning team. And they were saying the same thing. Another thing is the curtains I don't know why they're there. They don't provide shade or privacy if it's in the morning it doesn't block out any sun and that's so annoying. another thing is at night if you have the lights on everyone can see you from outside. The kitchen cabinets feel cheap and the sink is so small. However dishwasher and the rest are good quality since it's a new place.

4. PUBLIC SPACES. The public spaces is one of the main reasons I chose to live here. The top deck is nice. The gym is good. The centre area is nice as well. But its not for the tenants only. There are people who work here that use these spaces and sometimes they conquer them. I can't work out because they're having a workout session and take over the whole gym. What pisses me off the most is the music they play. In the morning everyday they play loud music and its impossible to sleep. On Sunday they do yoga in the centre area and have extremely high music. They're not even tenants. They also park inside the garage so if I'm out and then comeback to park my car sometimes they're in my parking spot. Its just frustrating.

5. PRICING. Its overpriced. Look at other apartments in the area and you will see the difference. EV living, market street village 13 and market all of them have bigger apartments and cheaper prices. The one bedrooms there is the same as a tiny studio with no balcony here.

6. LEASING OFFICE. So when I moved here, when I moved here they asked me if I want to refer someone I said yes and I gave them my friends name and his apartment number. This happened with two people. And its 300$ for each. 4 months passed and I come ask them every couple of weeks and every time they tell me it needs more time and I understood that. And when my bike was stolen the community manager promised to refund the bike cost which was around 400. So I went to the leasing office and the staff was changed. I asked the new one and the new agent was useless. He was rude and anything I told him he was saying where is your proof and how do I know if you're not lying and I can't help you. What do you mean where is my proof? What can I have as proof? I was in direct contact with the old leasing office. I talked to them every two weeks. Should I have recorded the conversations??? Calling me a liar is just disrespectful. I will be seeking to break my lease and I will update my review to tell you if they will be helpful or not. 1< /Text>< pics>

The reason for visiting a specialist like Dr. Ueno does not fall within pleasant things in life, but throughout all my surgeries and follow-ups I was made to feel special. From stepping over the threshold to the procedure to the last "good-byes" it was a great place to spend necessary time. Everybody, and I mean EVERYBODY, was always welcoming, cheerful, in good spirits, and at times downright funny. As strange as it may sound, I'll miss the place ... A big thank you to all at Ueno Center!<//review>

<Text>Profession trained staff, experienced doctor, clean environment.
But! You should always check your own insurance account before and after your visit. I was told to have $100+ balance during after surgery follow up visit. Staff said my insurance did not pay for January Consultation visit as they estimated.
My Feb. surgery estimated based on my insurance remaining $2300+ (out of total $2500 total coverage, after usage of consultation ) I paid my full treatment amount copay Feb. of $4000+.
After checking my insurance claims my $2500 coverage all paid to Ueno (since all my dentistry visits in 2021 was in Ueno) both to Jan. Consultation and Feb. surgery.
Even if my insurance didn’t pay for Jan. consultation it should pay total $2500 to Feb surgery as staff said (which wasn’t true), I should be over paying my Feb. surgery since the estimated my insurance had $2300+ (After consultation usage).

Either way all $2500 coverage should go to Ueno, it should be pretty straight forward estimate. It has to be easy for a staff full time doing such work.
Unfortunately I was told my invoice is on it’s way.< /Text>< pictures>

Dr.Uneo and his staff are all very professional. I appreciate the fact that their office is clean and modern and his team are very well organized and have helped me understand clearly all the procedures that are involved in my course of treatment. Everything from the process of my dental care to the costs involved have been clearly explained to me leaving me feeling relaxed and comfortable about getting dental implants which has made a huge difference to me as I was very anxious going in originally. I highly recommend Dr. Ueno.< /text>

My molar extraction and bone graft went quick and easy. With the TV and headphones as a distraction from the half hour procedure, it was over before I knew it. I had an extraction, bone graft and implant 2 months ago from another dentist, but with Dr Jeremy Ueno and Cali, my visit went easier.< /review>

Efficient, professional, detailed oriented, thorough, and friendly.   That is how i can describe the doctor and assistants at Ueno center.  Going to the dentist is not a pleasant experience, but they do make me feel at ease in my appointments. Most importantly, the result of their work is right on, no oops, no mistake, no rework.  I am quite pleased with Ueno center, and would highly recommend them.<//Review>

< Review>
Scam !!!!

I had laser surgery done by Dr. Bui mid 9/2020.   I was quoted an out of pocket expense of almost $8000, insurance covered the rest of the bill.  I paid the bill before surgery, came back for check up 2 weeks later.  Upon leaving after checkup I asked if I owed anything for the visit.  Was told “you’re good, everything is paid.  Checkup fee was already included in the bill !”

Five months later (2/2021) I got a bill for $475.  Called to inquire.  The same woman, Aaron,  who told me that “everything was paid” said coldly “you owe $475 for the work done !” SMH... such a scam.< /Review>

The service and efficiency of Ueno dental center is second to none! I've had multiple implants done with Dr. Ueno through a span of 3 years, and the results are phenomenal. I've experiencedno complication after these implants - they were all very successful. Dr. Ueno and his team are very professional and capable and the billing is transparent. I recommend Dr. Ueno and his team to friends families.</Text>

I had a broken tooth and was referred to the Ueno Center for an extraction. I opted for the nitrous oxide gas to calm my nerves, and it really worked out well for me. Dr. Ueno performed the extraction procedure in such a short time I was really surprised and impressed. I had no pain throughout the procedure and even during my recovery afterward. So my experience with this extraction is a very positive one. Moreover, Dr. Ueno and his staff at the Ueno center were very polite and professional, and it seemed as if they had a system going with their team synergy which was working well. I had a video conference follow up call with a nurse a week after the extraction and there were also follow up emails. That's not something you see usually in a small clinic. So I think it is worth mentioning.</review>

I was referred to Ueno Center by my dentist in December 2020 for further dental evaluation/ treatment. I received an appointment and was seen on January 8th, 2021. The staff were caring, warm, kind, compassionate, and professional.  The center was immaculately clean with strict Covid-19  protocol. I received excellent care and would highly recommend this  dental center. My sincere thanks to Dr. Bui.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

<rate>1</rate><review>this center will nickel and dime you. They will also perform procedures which you might not need.
For example they will sell you a bone graft when you don't need one because they get paid more to do it.
They will also miss things from doing very cursory exams. Being a periodontal specialist does not mean you can ignore the basic dentistry. They missed a cavity on a tooth right next to the one they extracted. Poor form. Finding a thorough and honest dentist is like finding a good mechanic. Hard to find but Dr Ueno is definitely not the one. Perhaps his partners are a bit more diligent and straightforward. This review pertains to Dr Ueno alone. Very charismatic and charming but a very quick working cursory dentist out for the biggest check he can make. Go somewhere else.< /review>< pictures>

I have been a patient at the Ueno center for several years now and the staff and dentists are very professional, knowledgeable, and courteous. I have had oral surgery as well as other regular dental check ups and dental cleaning sessions at this facility. They have kept up to date with both the latest in dental technology as well as instituted COVID related safety practices. I highly recommend these professionals for your oral care needs.<//Review>

I chose to see Dr. Ueno because of his unanimously excellent customer reviews. He is an outstanding professional and clearly cares about his patients. Dr. Ueno’s staff is similarly conscientious, friendly and thorough in their follow-up after each procedure. The Ueno Center Dental Specialists truly merits all the praise it receives.</review>

Professional. I find this a common theme at all departmental levels I've had the pleasure of experiencing at Ueno Center Dental Specialists. Courteous staff. Well laid out, comfortable office space and operating rooms. Dr. Lynna Bui, DDS, MPH, is brilliant as far as I am concerned. Exactingly professional. Yet at all times, patient and compassionate. It is easy for me to recommend Ueno Center Dental Specialists.

I was scheduled with a different doctor on the day we all went to shelter in place and that appointment was cancelled. I waited a week or two but was in pain from an infection in a back molar and my dentist recommended Dr. Ueno. The best move ever! He got me in as an emergency patient and pulled the tooth. He and his staff were so professional and SIP conscientious as well as welcoming and supportive. The office has state of the art equipment and follows all (if not more than) COVID-19 protocols. There are implants in my future so there will be more visits to the Ueno Center, with confidence!<//review>

I was referred to Ueno Center for wisdom teeth extractions from my orthodontist while in the middle of an Invisalign treatment. After reviewing my x-rays/report from my orthodontist, I was scheduled with Dr. Ueno since two of my wisdom teeth were under the gums and one was angled downward, so they wanted their most experienced doctor to treat me. Given COVID-19, everything went as well as I could expect. Their COVID protocol felt very safe once I arrived in their office. Things moved very quickly once I was in the patient chair and I opted for IV sedation, which worked very well. The entire staff was friendly and professional the whole visit. At home, the recovery instructions were very clear and detailed for me to follow. I had a question the next day and they were helpful in answering it over the phone, too. Two weeks later, the follow-up visit was done virtually, which saved me travel time. Thanks, Ueno Center! Now that I can eat normally again, I'm going to order a burger for lunch!</Text>

<text>From my initial phone contact through my procedure everyone was professional.  Their state of the art facility is immaculate and welcoming, following all COVID-19 protocols.

The Ueno Center is a top notch facility, run by efficient and professional personnel who communicate clearly at every step of the periodontal process, exactly what a patient needs to hear. I was very impressed by the entire team, as well as by the expediency of my procedure- only just over an hour! I was home and recovering in under an hour and a half. Additionally, pre-op steps and scheduling were handled well, so I was fully prepared with all required prescriptions upon returning home.

I highly recommend Dr. Ueno and his well staffed team for your periodontal needs.<//Review>

Extraordinary skill and care and...kindness and understanding for “anxious” patient.  Staff synergy and confidence ... calming to patient.  Written instructions and suggestions for post-op extremely helpful for daily reference.  Covid 19 protection in place and practiced.  Outstanding STAFF and Center!</text>

Dr. Ueno is an outstanding periodontist.  His expertise and skills are superb.  My daughter has had to have multiple grafts, and each one has been completed with success and great outcomes.  I recently had a gum graft, and the surgery went smoothly.  In addition to his talents, he is very personable with excellent bedside manner.  I always feel welcome and like he truly cares about the health and wellbeing of his patients.<//Text>

I was terrified of having a biopsy done. Even my normally low blood pressure was high at the beginning of the visit. Normally Novocain hurts as it flows in. But I didn't feel a single thing. The nurses and staff were exceptional and compassionate. They sweetly engaged with my nervous chit chat and completely understood my fears. Dr. Bui was so gentle, I didn't feel a single thing except her complete empathy for my fear. She and the nurses answered all my questions and provided lots of advice for things I didn't think to ask about. Plus, they sent me home with a goodie bag of useful items, like covid masks, a high quality water bottle and other items. It's like getting a lolly pop from your doctor, but better! Of all the healthcare fields, dentist visits are my least favorite. However, if I need to use an oral surgeon again, I won't have any fear or apprehension again returning to Ueno! It will be a piece of cake!< /Text>

Staff didn’t go over the details of how much they’ll ding me before the appointment.. They knew I did not have an insurance that covered the visit and I would’ve liked them to be up front with me about it, so that I don’t feel robbed at the end of the day. Won’t return for their services just because of this lack of ethics< /Text>

Dr. Bui and Dr. Ueno are the best dental specialists in the Bay Area. Let's face it, the idea of gum surgery is terrifying, but the entire process from their team was painless. They have a top notch, state of the art facility, paired with a professional staff.

Everyone there was friendly and I was really impressed from my experience here. I'm a business owner, so I'm rarely impressed from other businesses, unless they provide exceptional service. I had a gum graft here and I felt almost no pain at all, including my recovery.

I highly recommend you visit them for a consultation. It's almost impossible to get near perfect ratings nowadays - and I believe their work speaks for itself.< /Review>

She was so calm and nice and gentle and really pretty too!  She was really professional for surgery.  And, her assistants are so nice, and friendly. Especially, Gaby, she made me feel so comfortable that I forgot the fact that I was there for surgery-:)
I'm glad that I made a good choice of choosing Dr Chung as my implant surgery provider with all my trust and my heart.  She's the best of the best!< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

<date>1567122716239<//date><rate>5<//rate><review>I had implants done by Dr. Ueno at the Ueno Center. I traveled some distance because I was not satisfied with the oral surgeons in my area. I found the Ueno Center online, checked them out as much as I could, and made an appointment. I am glad I did.

The staff is professional, well-informed, responsive, and friendly. The entire operation seems well organized, very up-to-date, and of high quality. Dr. Ueno did my implants and it all went well. He is very knowledgeable, skilled at what he does, and personable. His discussion of my case and presentation of options were straightforward and clear. Ditto for his staff’s presentation of the cost of different options and what my insurance would cover. My treatment cost quite a bit less (not to say it is cheap!) than the other opinion I had gotten. This was because his costs were a bit lower but mainly because I needed fewer implants than the other doctor had told me. In the 4 weeks since the surgery, the after-treatment care has been good, the healing has gone well so far, and the staff is available for any questions I have had. I recommend Dr. Ueno for dental implant surgery.</review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

I just had a gum graft on the 6th at 10 am. I took my precious time to talk and ask questions as i was nervouse, grouchy and all together. The staff made me feel at comfort and took their time to listen to me. My nurse Becky was amazing at easing my anxiety, the dr assistant which I forgot her name was super super amazing soul. Erin who helped me with my payment was pleasant and took her time to call the care credit and get me interest free for some time. NICOLE helped me with scheduling and also helping me to calm down. However I did face some bleeding cloth complications after i got to daly city but right away i called the office staff and they told my bf to drive me there so they can stop the blood with tape and glue, I believe it would be best to let me stay there a little longer so they have control over my bleeding so we didnt have to drive 45 min again. Becky helped feeding me ensure with a syringe so that i can take my meds. I came home with pain yes but I must ice externally for 4 hours a day. Dr Ueno was so kind to me knowing I was nervous. Yes hes quick and just wants to finish because he has a tight schedule but u hope overall I will have a good outcome with my decision making.  I will write anothe review after my 2 weeks post surgery appointment to share my results overall.</Review>

The after-surgery recovery was far easier than the expectations that were set
The staff called the day after the procedure for a follow-up. I had no issues, but that would have been a great way to discuss any possible issues</review>< gmap_id>

<Review>I have had a couple of implant procedures done by Dr. Ueno. Nobody wants to go through this stuff, but he makes it bareable.  He is very thurough and professional. His staff is well trained, friendly and efficient. I highly reccommend their services.</Review>< user>

We feel terrible that your experience with us was not a stellar one.  We strive to give our patients the best experience possible, and for the most part, we believe we do deliver.  We have daily meetings regarding the schedule in our quest to schedule the "perfect day."  This is a day where all patients are sat on time, great work and customer service was delivered, and we finish on time.  Now, there are many factors that affect a dental offices flow throughout the day, and unfortunately, these factors can accumulate and if your appointment is later in the day, the delays can add up.  It is kind of similar to a delayed airline flight where one delay leads to multiple longer delays.  The factors that affect our flow includes emergencies (As a specialists office, we get multiple emergency patients sent to us daily to see), employees being sick that day or having to stay home because their kids are sick which can lead us to be understaffed as our "perfect day" is scheduled assuming we have a full team, sometimes patients are late, and sometimes cases take longer than anticipated, just to name a few things that can throw our schedule off.  Again, we never intend to run behind, but when we do, it is sometimes frustrating and many of the team members and doctors may show their emotions differently (Which sounds like is the case in reading your review).  At the end of the day, even if we are running behind, the goal is to deliver exceptional dentistry.  The dentistry never gets compromised.  The good news is that these days with delays are rare, and this is mainly because of our communication at the daily team meetings.  But... there are just some factors (Like the few mentioned previously) that are unavoidable that happen throughout the day in a dental office and affects our ability to seat everyone on time.  We do have to do better, however.  In reading your review, the one area where we could have done better is by informing you of the delay and giving you a more accurate estimate of waiting time since we were running behind.  Again, we apologize that your experience was not great, and we are appreciative that we have another chance to give you the experience in our office that every patient deserves.  Thank you again for your review.'}< /Resp>< user>

< Review>
Dr. Ueno's skills are top notch and excellent; it's evident that he is a very proficient and skilled practitioner. However, the areas where he can improve on is his bedside manners. I feel like I'm just one of many patients that he sees and that he's always in a big hurry to get in the room, do the procedure, and leave in a jiffy. I get it, he's on a tight schedule, aren't we all busy? But this last visit, I waited in the waiting room for almost 35 minutes, no one came to tell me that he was running late, I sat there wondering if I had time to get a cup of tea. Finally, after waiting so long, I started to make a cup only to then be finally called by the assistant, so I never go to drink my tea (not a big deal). The assistant was nice, but didn't apologize for the delay, didn't ask me how my day was, just going through the motion. She seemed tired. Later on, while getting me prepped, she was more communicative and friendly. When Dr. Ueno came into the room, I asked him whether I was too early because I wasn't sure if maybe I was the one who cause me to wait, but he apologized saying that he was running late. He numbed me up, but before the drug took effect, he proceeded to inject me with novocaine--so I basically felt all 3 shots. He left and then returned after the novocaine took effect. Then I had a lot of questions about my x-rays of my jaw and teeth, and it's because I'm a curious person and wanted to know what's going on, not because I didn't trust his skills. I was surprised at Dr. Ueno's tone of voice, he sounded impatient with me, almost irritated that I was asking so many questions.Maybe he thought I didn't trust him? Truth is, I just wanted to understand the condition of my bones and teeth.Again, I had this sense of "hurry, hurry, hurry....go, go, go...." And yes, the procedure was very fast, his movements were fast, which is good in showing confidence and competence. After he sutured my gums, he zipped away. So if you don't mind the hurried pace and feeling like just another set of teeth to be worked on, then Dr. Ueno's the doctor for you. I think it is possible for doctors to have competency & efficiency while still having the atmosphere of being present and attentive, and caring. I hesitated writing this review, because I still have more work to be done, but I felt that it was important for me to write this review so you will know what the atmosphere is like. He's definitely competent and efficient, but the relationship-building is lacking.</Review>

<Rate>5</Rate><review>I sure am glad I chose the Ueno Center, after shopping around for an implant. The [free] initial consultation was scheduled quickly. The examination included a free CT scan, and Dr. Lynna Bui's examination was extremely  thorough and unrushed. After the exam, the fees (not the cheapest), and scheduling were discussed. Ueno even gives an implant guarantee .  I was able to get an appointment for the implant very quickly.  I was grateful that Dr Bui was able to perform the extraction and implant at the same time. While I watched all my stocks hit an all time high on CNBC from the ceiling-mounted monitor, Dr Bui performed the complex and painless extraction and implant smoothly. Throughout, I was always reassured by her confident and soothing voice during the surgery. Post Op, I had no bleeding or swelling, and little pain. If you need an implant, Ueno and Dr. Bui will be your best choice.<//review>< pictures>

<Review>I had a very positive appointment with Dr. Jeremy Ueno and his staff.  This was my first visit with Dr. Ueno and I had a very favorable experience as soon as I walked in the door.  Everything was first class from the building itself, neatness of the reception area, up-to-date dental equipment, number of staff members and the friendiness of everyone.  It's the first time that I had dental work being done while watching golf on TV!  I'm happy that my dentist recommended Ueno Periodontics.</Review><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None<//resp>< GmapID>

I hate anything to do with dental work- I even put off a teeth cleaning for 4 years because of my sensitive teeth. Well I had a teeth cleaning by Ueno recently and they have made me a believer. Then I had a gum graft by Ueno and I can easily say there is no place I would rather have dental/gum work done. Every interaction is stress free and they are extremely good at their technical work.</Text>

< Review>
I am very impressed! From the moment my dentist referred me to Dr. Ueno it was a very good experience for me. I had two emergency molar extractions to do, not an easy job and they fit me in their schedule right away, Dr. Ueno explained me all option I have with great details, very knowledgeable, very caring and very supportive. The follow up is amazing as well, to make sure I am doing all the right things to heal fast, they informed me in great details about the healing process what to expect and what to do. The office is remarkably well organized, everybody does their job so well that I could just relax and go with the flow. And everybody was pronouncing my name correctly! Every little detail was perfect. I am looking forward working with Dr. Ueno in getting the implants done. And yes, I already recommended Dr. Ueno and I will continue doing it to anyone that wants the best.< /Review>

I have never been in so much pain in spite of many novocain shots.

From the moment I entered the office I was impressed and I knew I was in good hands.

Dr. Joyce Litch has a horrible bed side manner.  I found her to be condescending, rude and argumentative.  She even made an off-handed comment to her assistance about one of the other office workers during my so-called examination.  She needs a job that doesn't required interacting with the public - she may be more successful behind the scenes at an office desk.  I hope that other dentist are better - it's low bar.</text>

I have been consistently impressed by the work performed by Dr. Ueno.  His many satisfied patients love to share their experience and he has rightfully deserved his 100% 5 star reputation.  When it comes to advanced technology and being on the cutting edge, Dr. Ueno is an expert.  Consider yourself fortunate should you have the opportunity to be a patient at his practice.  His staff exudes warmth and friendliness and the atmosphere is very positive and upbeat.  Kudos to you Dr. Ueno!</Text>

I had a crown lengthening procedure performed Tuesday September 19, 2017 by Dr. Jamie Chung at Ueno Center Dental Specialists.  They were courteous, professional,  informative, efficient and they answered all of my questions.  No one likes to have dental surgery, but if you have to have a procedure I would highly recommend Dr. Jamie Chung or one of the other professionals at Ueno Center!</text>

<Text>I had to have 6 implants at a rather old age to save my remaining natural teeth.   My dentist referred me to Dr. Ueno's practice.  The first thing I noticed was his modern system and apparatus, as well as the courteous and very professional attitudes of their staff.  Dr. Ueno was diligent to ensure that my medical history would not negatively affect my periodontal surgery.   His skillful work made all 6 procedures smooth and without any problems or side-effects despite my past medical conditions.   Dr. Ueno and his staff were promptly responsive to any questions or concerns that I had after each procedure and I was given immediate appointments for a review of the results and monitoring of the healing process.   The post-surgery service was very generous and produced ease of mind for me.   I am now enjoying 6 new permanent teeth.  One warning if you are not a teenager: The appointments coordinator / receptionist speaks too fast for an average patient (but she is very courteous and professional)!!

Thank you Ueno Periodontics!< /Text>< gmapID>

<Text>Can't say enough about how happy I am with my first visit to Dr. Ueno and Dr. Chung's practice. I've had a receding gum on one of my teeth for some time. I came in this morning to get it checked out. I knew I would need to get a grafting procedure done sooner of later, and was hoping I could get it taken care of ASAP. Dr. Chung was nice enough to let me get the procedure done the same day. I came back later in the day and they took care of me. They took time to answer all my questions and the surgery was swift and painless! As I type this review the same night of the surgical procedure, I don't feel any pain from the procedure (note: I'm not taking any painkillers) and swelling has been minimal. I feel so fortunate to have been able to take care of all this in one day!

< review>
I've had a mixed experience with one of the periodontists at this practice.  I had two gum grafts.  One was successful, but the other did not build up much gum tissue on the target tooth.  I was then told it is because that tooth is 'moving' - & that I should get orthodonture and then come back.  The orthodonture is close to $7K.  Why didn't they figure this out before going ahead with the graft?!!  What single tooth is worth close to $10K?  An implant would be less!</review>

< Review>
Very painless procedure, beautifully designed facility, very friendly and professional staff, it is a pleasure to get a treatment at Ueno Center. Huge improvement in the gum health after laser procedure. Bleeding completely stopped during flossing and brushing.< /Review>

Jim O’Reilly has been doing our taxes for a very long time I would not go any place else. He always gives friendly service, he’s got a great sense of humor, and I like the fact that our taxes are guaranteed and if there’s any problem he will fix it.<//Review>

James O'reilly has been doing my taxes for several years and he always exceeds my expectations.  He takes the time to make sure everything is done right.  Wouldn't trust my tax preparation with anyone else.< /Text>

<Review>H&R Block's free online tax software is a SCAM. It says it's free for fed and state taxes, but once you fill our your state taxes, it will say you need to pay $44.99 for them to file and keep your tax return. Waste of time, I feel cheated. Avoid if possible. Oh, and if I need help from someone? That'll be an extra $80 to live chat, despicable.</Review>< Gmap_id>

I am a very low income earner and can't afford to lose the money y'all charge. I did it this year because I was having trouble doing it on my own online. Although the gentleman who helped me was very nice and knowledgeable he dozed off twice while he was waiting for pages to load on computer. I have always used your services and will continue if it is affordable or necessary.< /text>

<Text>The receptionist refused to honor the $30. Coupon I received in the mail. I will not ever return to get my taxes done at H$R Block and I’ll tell everyone I know to avoid H&R Block. It will cost the company more than the $30. They refused to honor.</Text>< Pictures>

<Review>I have been using H&R Block for the past couple years and to be honest I haven't been getign anything back for some reason unknown to me. This last time I went to the H&R Block on Broad Street in San Luis Obispo and my tax professional Kim J. helped me tremendously and I am actually getting a return this year! Kim showed she truly cared about my time and taxes and to me that's huge. Thank you Kim and thank you H&R Block.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Date>

<Review>I'm a student, and I work full time. I had a W2, and some accounts I needed to file. I was never actually quoted how much it would cost, but I let the lady finish my taxes regardless after seeing all the "free student" commercials; I didn't think it would be too expensive. I was charged $220, and it took an extra 2 weeks due to my tax agent not understanding how to deal with my forms fully. On a positive note, the agent was friendly, communication was easy, and it's a professional business.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

This place is very expensive.  With the amount of time it takes to prepare your taxes for you they are easily making a killing.  If you don't have time or don't know how to do your taxes this place is probably your best option.

My advice..learn how to do them yourself.< /text>

Very happy with the food although I think the lobster and corn chowder needs to be eaten in small quantities since I couldn't finish the bowl without getting sick of it. It tasted like the most awesome soup for 1/2 the bowl before a slow 1/4 more. They do provide amazing lobster roll bread to dip into the chowder. I wonder if it's because of how much butter is in the soup.<//Review>

Food is very good but not as good as Bates plus it was $10 more for the same thing as Bates.  Bates on MLK Boulevard is definitely the best in taste and price<//review>

< Review>
Went to this bank to cash my check, this Indian teller was so rude. would not say anything when helping me, walked away (I guess to get an approval) came back, then gave me my money.. (this is when it got good) all of a sudden he could speak. Just to tell me I can go shopping!!! and Shopping.. then it dawn on me he was selling me a credit card (I am sure they have good ones) He kept on telling me to apply, and apply without telling me about them.. such a horrible sales person, sounded like a used car sales man selling me a broken down car. next time I go to cash my check I'll either go to another window or another branch... Avoid this guy when you come here<//Review>

The lobby security on the weekend was chatting with other staff all the time and not quite willing to help when I asked. He didn't know what to do and called other people come to help after he mess up a while.</Review>

Worst service at this branch... I show up at 5 on the dot, after I walked a mile to get to the bank before the close and the midget working there tells me to deposit it at the ATM. And guess what check won't deposit so now I have to go back another day and hopefully make it in time. Lazy employee and poor customer service. First time in over a decade I've had bad service at a US Bank. I use them for personal and the business I own.< /Review>

<text>Top to bottom extremely happy with this company and would recommend them to anyone in the greater Sacramento area.

After seeing some of the work they did for a family member we had 2 sliding doors installed both in our living room and bedroom. From the minute when Taylor, the design consultant, came over we knew we were in good hands. The install was all done in 1 day for both doors very professionally by Serge. Everyone we interacted with at Reliable was on time and extremely responsive.

Some things people don't often think about- Reliable carries adequate liability insurance, products were backed by warranty, all employees are W2. All this were very important to us beyond just the work they did.

Great product, great price, excellent install. Not much more you can ask for, Reliable will be our first call going forward with all home improvement projects.

Here are some after and before pics of the work they did.<//text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNqRxpDAUQufOG1thYnAOv3p5PgJuwzR0EfrJAW=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOBts5HWCEHNrUbxAS5g22Cap4EeCQ3zSMWIA4X=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics><Resp>{'time': 1619717960884, 'text': 'Kris, seeing that you had a 5-Star experience is the best thing we could hope for!

<text>This is our third project with Reliable Home improvement.  That is probably the best review right there.  The current project was a granite look, colored, concrete walkway and patio in our backyard.  It turned out fabulous!   What I especially appreciate is the experience they have at creative transitions. We have a very sloped lot, but they tied the existing deck and other features into the new pour beautifully.  Absolutely recommend.</text><Response>{'time': 1627670101898, 'text': 'Thanks for the awesome review, Roberta!

We chose Reliable Home Improvement to remodel the wet area of our guest bathroom. I had found them using a Google search and saw that they had rather good reviews. We met with Cliff to get our estimate and he was very professional and friendly. He was very upfront with us about cost and what was involved with the remodel. We were worried about water damage behind the shower wall. All three companies we got estimates from said they couldn't give us an idea of cost of repair for the water damage since they couldn't see behind the wall. Anyway, in the end we went with Reliable. Cliff did warn us about the start time for the project. They were scheduling out six months. We were expecting this because COVID has slowed manufacturing way way down so getting the fixtures we wanted could take a long time. We met with Cliff in March and all of our bathroom fixtures came in the beginning of June. Reliable started our project towards the end of June. Laura was our project contact. She came out and met with us and gave us all the info we needed to pick out fixtures. She was also very friendly and very professional. Both she and Cliff were very knowledgeable. This is our first home so obviously we know nothing about remodeling ANYTHING. We had A LOT of questions. Jason was our installer. He was great to work with. He was very professional and really friendly. My husband and I work from home and we were worried about noise and such while the bathroom was getting redone. Jason did his best to keep the noise to a minimum. As much as you can when you’re demolishing a bathroom. Jason made sure to get our input on placement and installation of things before putting them in. Our bathtub we had ordered had somehow got broken during shipment. Jason and Reliable made every effort to get a replacement tub right away. The project was only setback a day. The project took about two weeks to complete. The end result was absolutely amazing! Our new bathtub, water fixtures, and tile are gorgeous! Everything came out looking so good. Jason did an incredible job. There were a couple issues that needed to be taken care of post installation. Jason came out the same day and fixed them. With no issues and no hidden costs at the end. Working with Reliable was a wonderful experience. They may not the cheapest contractors in town, but they are also not the most expensive. Trust me, you get what you pay for. I would highly highly recommend!< /Review>

<review>Reliable was fast, efficient, and affordable. Our bathroom was transformed in two short weeks. There was zero pressure to spend, and with the one unexpected hiccup that occurred the fox was fast and affordable. The crew was polite and responsible. Everything happened on time. We will be using Reliable again to transform our family room and any additional work we need!</review>< Rate>

<rating>5</rating><text>This was our 3rd project with Reliable,(stucco, windows, bathroom remodel). Removing the old siding and replacing it with stucco has transformed our home's curb appeal. Looks Great. We were impressed with Cliff's (saleman) professional attitude, he answered all our questions regarding the project and each phase. The workers were on time, courteous. Shawn (owner) personally oversaw our stucco project, so we knew we were in good hands. Reliable does excellent quality work. I would recommend Reliable to anyone searching for a home improvement project.
Thanks,  Robert Orozco</text>< Pics>

Everything went well.  However I have an issue with the quarter round molding in the kitchen.  I should have mentioned it earlier but I apologize  for not. Because the wood was so raw, I could have used a second coat of stain.  Thanks again.  Ed.</Text>

Love Reliable! They installed a tiered rock retaining wall and it is amazing. They had done my windows before and were excellent. This project was even bigger. I am so pleased that I am asking for help with another project.< /Text>

<Text>We used Reliable Home Improvement to remove our old driveway and pour a new driveway, as well as widen our cement path on the side of our garage. We were approached due to them doing work in the area and was given a 10% coupon if we hired them. The process for getting a quote was easy, and the representative was friendly and informative. We were originally looking for quotes for a different remodel project, but decided to complete a cheaper project now rather than wait longer to complete the more expensive remodel. During the initial quote process, we were told they could give special pricing that day for cement work because they were low on work in that area at the time. I did mention the coupon, and had it on the counter visible while discussing with the rep our various projects and our ideas for cement out front. We were given their regular price, and then their "best and final price" if we signed the contract same day. We agreed and moved forward with scheduling the job for the cement work. I should have done the math at the consultation, but realized after payment that the "best and final" price was not even the 10% discount that we had been given on the coupon. We were soon contacted by the project manager Patrick to schedule the job. He called twice more to delay our job due to other jobs taking longer than expected. Once our job was finally scheduled and happening, the crew arrived on time and made quick work of the demo and setting the forms. However, the forms were not set right, and they blamed the inadequate photos and unclear instructions that their own company had provided them. The error was fixed the next morning before pouring, but was still not the width that we had originally agreed on. They cut through a few sprinkles, but fixed the line. During demolition they also crushed our sewage cap and said they would be back out in a few days to replace it with a new one, and would also rebury our cable cords. We noticed after the crew had left for the day, that they had scraped the excess cement from their shoes or tools onto our sprinkler head, which had dried cement plugging the holes, and we had to clean and pick out, which was very frustrating. A few days later, someone came by to rebury the cable, but no new sewer cap. After a week had gone by, I reached back out to Patrick and he was unaware that it hadn't been fixed and said it would be done in the next couple of days. Another week went by with no sewer cap, and no contact from the company. We then started seeing sewage coming out of the open broken hole into our yard. The County came out and assessed the line, and found that several large parts of the plastic sewer cap had gone down into the line and caused a clog. They fixed the issue and replaced our sewer cap. All in all, the driveway looks nice and we are glad we got it redone, but I don't know if I would use this company again. Which is unfortunate, because we were really hoping to find a company we could continue to use for other projects and have a trusted relationship with.<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

When I contacted Jeff, he explained that when they see "no soliciting" they make it a point to "not knock or ring the bell, but just leave a flyer."

Edit to respond:
I appreciate the response.

A mailer or other solicitation is something I don't get upset over. Advertisement is part of life.

That sign was the politest way I could say, "yes I mean you!"

When a vendor hears an upset dog, keeps coming, see the sign & thinks "I'm already here, I might as well" I have a problem.

I have a Ring video that shows the dog start barking before your person gets to the door, he continues to approach, sees the sign, and casually tosses your advertisement on the ground like litter I have to clean up.

Update 5/4/21:
Contrary to the response below, today another copy of the same flyer was stuffed in my door handle.

Update 2:
I tried calling the number on the flyer. Jeff seems too remember my number, said he had nothing to say to me, and then hung up on me. Since the owner responded below before I've called found the office number to try talking to them.<//Review>< pictures>

Reliable Home Improvement has worked with me throughout my improvement needs...installed double pane windows, electrical in 4 rooms, exterior dry rot repair, flooring installation. Their work crews were on time, always left the work site clean, and because the company has all phases of construction people working with them, there is no waiting for sub-contractors to come.
I would highly recommend this company.

I have had my floors and then my master bathroom done by Reliable, and both projects turned out beautifully.  I love my new bathroom and am excited about my next home improvement project - my patio.  They were easy to work with and helped me select just the right materials that coordinated just perfectly.  Very pleased with both the quality of the work and the professionalism and courtesy of the workers during the remodeling process.</text>

<review>We signed a contract with Reliable after receiving 5 other bids.
The work consisted of 2 complete bathroom remodels and new tiling in our entry hall.
Reliable is aptly named as they completed the job on time with few noticeable interruptions to our daily life.  Jason was chosen to perform the actual work and showed himself to be a true artisan.  I would recommend him for any home project because of his professionalism, attitude and desire to please the customer at all costs.< /review>< Name>

I have had three projects done by Reliable Home Improvement.  The first was replacing the countertops in my kitchen.  They did a great job.  I like the fact that they make sure that all state and city codes are met.  They do little extra things like replace all the kitchen electrical outlets and plates so they all match.  They even came with me to Arizona Tile to pick out quartz slab for the counter tops.

The second project was replacing two sliding glass doors.  They were removed and installed in one day.  The doors also came with screens.

The third project was a complete remodel of the hall bathroom.  You get complete freedom to choose flooring, vanity, countertops, paint, mirrors, tubs, and faucets.  The company gives you recommendations of where to shop, but you are free to shop as you please.  If you ask they will give you some recommendations which I have found to be useful.  Occasionally, there will be restrictions due to codes.  I love the way my bathroom looks now.  This was all done during covid, and I felt no pressure when the vanity I wanted took a couple of months to arrive at my house.

I am now in the process of having my Master Bathroom remodeled by  Reliable.

Some of the things that I like about the company are the following.  They do not start a project until all items have arrived.  Once they start the project, they stay until the project is finished.  They clean up after themselves each day.  They do not smoke on the property.  Except in a rare circumstance, they do not use foul language.  They are punctual.
Everyone is very polite.

A warning.  Reliable warns that there will be dust, but if you are having tile work done, I suggest you cover up any furniture, curtains and blinds.  The tile dust is thick and can be difficult to remove.< /Review>

Reliable got a lot of business from us in 2019.  They did our new roof, new gutters, and concrete patio/extension installations.  I cannot say enough about how professional and patient the crews were with me when they came over to do the work.  I am currently saving to have them come back in a few years to overhaul my kitchen.

<review>My husband and I had 3 major projects done on our home over the winter. First we had new flooring installed. We chose luxury vinyl plank (golden oak) style. After looking at a slab flooring throughout our home for 6 years after some flooding, we finally had something nice to look at. I'm still admiring these floors. Our whole house was done, including closets. A couple of mishaps though while the work was being done, one being they scuffed a good 2 foot area while sliding the hutch back into place in the dining room. BUT they were able to buff it out with a solution specifically made for that. The other issue was I believe it was Juan, he broke one of the ceramic bathroom tiles while working around that doorway in that area and didn't tell us about it. They had to glue the strip across the doorway and had blue painters tape in place for 24 hours. So the following day when I removed the tape, I saw the 3 cracks. Shawn the owner did offer to have his guys replace that tile but at the time we didn't know where they were stored so we said forget it. Also the furniture in the living room they had put back before I had a chance to sweep the floors or vacuum up the pieces left behind when they swept. I wanted to vacuum it all up but the crew wanted to have the living room done so we'd have a room to enjoy while they worked on the rest of the house. Also the baseboards were left with smudges, scratches, and some small chipped areas that Juan's crew filled in with caulking. Every single room had such dirty baseboards that my husband and I decided to paint over them. They were so ugly, they looked 20 years old with family scuff marks over time. They did not look brand new at all. But hey, we have new flooring and baseboards but I do have my work cut out for me moving the furniture out in every room to properly clean the floors and paint the baseboards.
That said, next job was new windows. Anlin, tinted windows. They work so well to keep the heat out, I'm freezing in the winter time even with the curtains open, no heat comes in from the sun. But now that it's summer time, I do feel "some" heat from the sun but it's nothing to complain about. Jerry did a great job. He had no idea what he was in for when he reviewed the job. We had 9 windows and the slider door replaced. The only mishap there was a long gash on the dining room windowsill which can be filled, sanded, and repainted. Oh and come to find out, evidently when Jeremy gave us the estimate for the windows, they had trim all around them. But when the windows were delivered, none of them  had the trim. I guess with the stucco it wouldn't work with that type of trim. Thanks Jeremy for a big disappointment in that area because I only chose those windows (style) because of the trim. At the same time, we decided to have some siding removed and replaced with stucco to match the rest of the house. When they removed our back security light, they broke it, so we had to buy a new one. They didn't rehang the cable wires the way we had them, even after I showed him how I wanted it done, they did it their way which now leaves an eyesore at the front entrance.  We decided to get a new screen door and a new porch light to match the rest of our new looking home. Overall we are pleased with the work. Our home looks so much nicer outside and inside. The stucco color was matched perfectly AND to make it up to us with the little mishaps here and there, they offered to apply a coat of stucco around the whole house! They offered us a choice of texture and we chose the small style. What a difference! We just love it. They ALSO replaced all the drain spouts without cost to us AND they painted them too to match the house. I have to say that I really enjoyed getting to know the guys and gals at Reliable. They are funny and friendly, like family. I would recommend them to anyone and we will consider them for future projects. We got great deals on every job. Totally satisfied. THANKS RELIABLE!</review><user_name>Debra Chabot<//user_name>< resp>

This review will be updated as work progresses. Background story - we found water stains on our ceiling a few weeks ago when we brought home the Christmas tree. We knew it was not good and had to get a contractor out asap. We called Reliable based upon all the reviews and luckily received a same day appointment with Joe M (J6).

Joe arrived promptly at 11 and greeted us with his friendly smile and overall great personality.  We discussed with him our needs and as we went along he provided background knowledge and expectations.  Sadly since we have tile that Reliable does not work with, we would have to go with a different contractor for the roof. We still however needed the drywall and any other issues in the attic addressed.

Somehow we got a little off track doing all the chatting with him, sharing similar family stories etc., And mentioned we wanted a bathroom remodel. Joe asked us for our thoughts, showed similar photos that could resemble what we were thinking and added some input which was very helpful. While we talked, he explained how Reliable handled their business and their would make sure they met our every need.

So now we having our Master Bath updated and the drywall repair handled for a price that will match the quality of work promised and expected. Joe couldn't have made such a perfect first impression of this company. We look forward to working with Joe M. Many many more times in the future.< /Text>

<Name>Cookie Hood<//Name><time>1554931495930</time><Rating>5< /Rating><review>We had a 16 X 20 foot concrete slab poured by Reliable. The man that came out and did our estimate for the work was very professional and very kind. He explained everything that we needed to know about concrete. As soon as the rain stopped, we were contacted that they were ready to come out and begin the project. The workers were very clean, neat and speedy. They made short work of digging out the area where the slab was going to be poured. It rained the next day so they came to pour the concrete the day after. They were here all day long to pour and then to caress the concrete into a beautiful slab. They gave us full instructions on how to care for the concrete until we were ready to use it for our outbuildings. We had two follow-ups by their management before the final inspection. The grade on our slab was probably 12 to 15 in below the surface of the surrounding grass. They followed up by correcting the slope of the yard away from the house, and then putting 2 to 3 in river rock around the slab. It is truly beautiful. I would absolutely recommend Reliable to do almost any project that falls under their ability to do.< /review>< pics>

<Rating>1<//Rating><Text>Our family worked with these guys for 5 year's. They fixed 5 of our properties in total. They bacame almost like family, being our go to for anything. When we were looking for solor for our home they pushed the PACE program through ygreen. We were told adding solor to our home would add value to our home, and once we sold our home the loan would go with the home. We would not have to pay it off first. Then we got a letter stating our house was now under a lien. After reaching out to reliable we were told that was normal and the lien would be removed once work was finished. But it never was, 2 years later reliable told us they stopped working with ygreen because they were getting similar complaints about this. The original cost was 40grand to be paid down over 20 years. We are trying to sell our home, but cannot do so until the solor is completely paid off. The bill is now 53 grand!!! We are losing that in escrow, reliable reaction to the 53grand was " right on"?? They gave us horrid advice, after we had payed around 300000 to them over the years for work. Now we are stuck losing money on our home, there was never even an apology for screwing us. This is a multi million dollar company that pretends to care. They offered to buy our home, but only if we payed the solor off ourself!!! Really, they are less then human. They don't care what happens to clients. We are so deeply hurt over this. Yes we are reaching out to an lawyer to figure out repercussions. Watch out they are snakes in the grass waiting to prey on anyone.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

From the salesperson (Reliable Joe Maldonado) to the project manager (Patrick) and especially the on-site foreman (Victor) and his entire crew, the job was professionally handled. The crew was on time every day and work quickly and efficiently. Always accommodated my questions and concerns and often went above and beyond to make sure the job was perfect. Everyone who stops by to see the finished product comments how how good the work looks. I highly recommend Reliable Home Improvement.<//Review>

Reliable employees were efficient, courteous and professional. The company kept us informed, in advance, regarding starting date—weather was an issue—and began the project at the time promised. The workers came prepared and were organized. Their supervisors were available for questions throughout the process and responded quickly to concerns—mostly our interests in the process. After the work was completed, in this case a 100 ft stamped concrete retaining wall, cleanup was thorough. We have already hired them for our next project—waterless grass

<text>Joe the salesperson was knowledgeable, honest, prompt, and courteous, and was available to answer all questions and concerns that I had. He was also upfront about projects that weren’t a good fit for Reliable.
The work done has seemed to stand up, and it was done in a timely manner. The Reliable foreman and all the subcontractors did a good job, and clean med up everything when done. No only complaint would be the amount of debris inside my garage after the roof removal- I knew that there would be some debris, but I was surprised by how much, and I’d have preferred that some of my items in the garage had been covered. In all fairness however, there were actually 3 roofs to be removed instead of just two. But all in all, I’m very satisfied with the sales team and satisfied with the work done. I would consider using Reliable for future work, and I would recommend them to friends and family.</text><pics>None</pics><Response>None</Response><gmap_id>0x809adfbeb7eebb17:0xcf9c940ad9e667f8< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

As clients with doctorates in business administration and teaching credentials, my family and I share our admiration and appreciation for the quality services provided by Reliable Home Improvement. From Jesse in sales, Jerry the installer, and owner Sean, we received excellent information, scheduling, professional window installation, after-care and support. This is truly thoroughly experienced, reliable and high-quality operation. Kudos to them. We will definitely contact them for additional projects. The Windows are beautiful!<//text>

First class job. Driveway looks great. Crew was friendly, knowledgeable, and conscientious. David Dudley did a great job of setting everything in motion...giving several options.  Patrick was great with follow up. I am so pleased with their work that I've hired them to do siding for the house.</text>

From start to finish, we were kept up to date on when and who would be here to do the work.  We had 11 can lights installed in several rooms.  Our kitchen received six lights to replace our old fluorescent ones that were recessed in the ceiling.

They removed the old lights and then professionally framed in the new can lights.  After a fresh coat of paint was applied on the trim and box, the ceiling was painted and all access holes were patched and painted to match existing wall color.

New popcorn ceiling was patched and the color matched perfectly,  We had great follow up from Wes, the coordinator, and Fred the final auditor.  Fred and I went through the checklist to make sure we were happy.  It was a rainy day and I noticed that one of our windows had a leak.

I asked Fred to look at it and he told me that he would send a worker out to make sure the leak was not from any work they did (They had to run new wiring in the attic to power the new lights).  As promised, their worker came here in less than 24 hours and looked at the leak.

He discovered that the trim around the window had a crack and needed calking.  He offered to calk it for me but I still needed to get calk and told him I can take care of it.

This company did an excellent job and upon leaving for the day and at the end of the job, they picked up and cleaned any mess they made.  We would use them again and are very happy with the end result.  We highly recommend Reliable Home Inc. for any project you may have.  You owe it to yourself to at least give them a call to get an honest estimate.< /Text>

I had my entire house of Windows, a new Owens Corning roof, stucco done to one wall of my house. I also had exterior paint job, and interior paint job of four different rooms and two bathrooms all done by Reliable. Great workmanship, fantastic workers provided excellent customer service, answered all of my questions throughout all of the phases and we're very patient. They went above and beyond for me and  installed two hand rails and two small steps to make it easier to access my front door. Thank you to Joe, Shawn and all the crews that worked on my house.  I was impressed that throughout the process the project coordinator and owners of the company stopped by many times to make sure I was 100% satisfied. It was very reassuring knowing that they were here for me whenever I needed them.< /Text>

<review>We have used Reliable Home Improvement for three projects now.  The first one was a small emergency job but they responded immediately and treated it just like it was a big project for a repeat customer.  They did such a great job it was an easy decision to have them do more work when we needed it.  They really move things along quickly always checking to make sure the work is as we discussed.  We have had work done by others that we were not happy with and despaired of finding a company we could rely on. Now, we are so happy to know Reliable will be there to help with our list of projects.  The entire crew have been wonderful; responsive, courteous and knowledgeable. We would like to give a shout out to Greg P. and Gabriel G., all the great field crew and the wonderful office staff.  Thanks for all your great work and advice!<//review>< pictures>

<review>Reliable Home Improvement recently replaced the siding on our house. Our house looks BEAUTIFUL!!! The whole process from start to finish was positive and easy. Our Senior Design Consultant Joe was so patient, meticulous, and helpful in deciding our color and siding options. He set the tone for our Reliable experience!  The team of Alex, Denis, and Yuriy who installed our siding worked so hard with great attention to detail and were constantly checking in to make sure we were happy with the progress. Everyone we worked with was very professional and attentive. I highly recommend Reliable Home Improvement for your next home improvement project.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures>< name>

<review>We have used reliable home improvement three times to update renovate our home the results were exceptional the work was done as promised and on schedule. Sometimes actually ahead of schedule The workmen were professional and skilled at their trades. When they were done the area was left clean you wouldn’t know they had even been there except for the improvements they made. It was a pleasure dealing with Tim Cliff and even one of the owners Sean stop by we would absolutely recommend a reliable home-improvement to anybody who is considering some home improvements to their home.</review></record>

They remodeled our bathroom which required a complete demolition and rebuild including replumbing. Cliff, the sales person,  gave us accurate information  and helped us find a way to finance the project that worked for us. Laura, the project manager help us find the design elements we were looking for by recommending vendors who had productsthat matched our ideas of what we wanted. Laura always returned phone calls quickly and she answered our questions.  Sergiy did most of the work.  He can best be described as a craftsman. He has exceptional skills in all areas required in a remodel. Gary, who did several finish tasks, did excellent work also.

The crews they have sent have all been very professional. From the patio cover to the new house paint job. We would highly recommend Reliable for your home improvement projects. We were so impressed that they will be putting on a new roof for us.<//Review>

<Rate>5</Rate><Text>We originally hired Reliable to replace our existing fence, remove some foliage and grade a large portion of the backyard. We were more than impressed with the sales staff and crew. They did great work on the fence and backyard and are a company that goes above and beyond the normal scope of work you would expect from any other company. After the first job we decided we wanted to extend our RV port (install a square concrete slab) and knew exactly who to call. Again Reliable did a great job and made sure we were happy with the outcome before signing off on the job. We had Reliable out for a third time when we decided to put in new windows, new sliding glass door and a patio cover. Reliable did a great job and not only painted the new stucco around our windows but the entire wall as well! As everyone knows issues do arise in construction and Reliable was always happy to correct any errors and make sure the job was done to our satisfaction.  I would definitely highly recommend this company to anyone who needs any home improvement work done.<//Text>< Gmap_id>

<Text>We love our windows so much we are getting more for the rest of the house! The approval and installation process was easy. Jesse and the reliable team answered all our questions, stayed in contact between signing papers and installation, and were on time for each day of the project. We have noticed a significant change in noise and heat in the house on top of the windows just looking better. Looking forward to doing more house projects with Reliable!< /Text><Name>Chelsea Jones<//Name>< user>

It's really soft and from what we read, it has a cooling technology so it doesn't get super hot in the summer! Perfect for our son! It was installed in one day too so that was awesome!

We had the most amazing experience with Reliable Home Improvement. They first installed flooring in on a newly purchased house then remodeled our kitchen. Honestly both were completed on time and look even better than expected. They are friendly, professional and RELIABLE in every way. I recommend to all our friends.<//Review>

<Text>Just want to leave this as a positive review because of Tim whom is a marine veteran, is an amazing salesman who follows the core values of what I think Reliable should be and what can be.  However, leadership is horrible the GM whom decided to come to our home and do final arrangements and measurements totally ruined our experience and trust with reliable.  If you are planning on doing something simple, small, in the sub $5000 range and have your decorations and ideas already mapped out then Reliable is good for you.  However, if you are looking for design help/assistance and more ideas brought upon unfortunately the GM will tell you that can’t be done “we have to do what is in their inventory.”  Or you have to go shop on your own with the budget in your quote.  Ummm we are spending almost 40k we can get an Audi S5 for that price.  Moreover, customer service skills massively lack or are missing with leadership and understanding of someone whom is battling cancer recovery and was in the hospital for about 7 months straight and mentioning a couple days of family needs in the hospital and laughing at us saying he needs to get to his wife like it’s the end of the world. Now our family and anyone who is looking for help in that regard shouldn’t look for this company as you will get laughed at like you are a peasant. On top of that had the audacity to reference getting water on demand when asked upon while leaving lab/infusion appointment while our caregiver was at the house was a little disturbing. Furthermore we couldn’t deal with the stress so had to end soon upon ending the GM decided to tell our son (5 year old) to pick up tiles that was left on the floor, multiple sample decorations.  Unfortunately, this GM ruined our perception of this great company that Tim has, which is an amazing vision and ideas that in my career path would match what would coincide with any company.

I’ll leave this here Tim got us to sign a contract on the upwards of 35-37k and it was smashed with leadership.  Home Depot can do the same for almost 27k with real wood not laminate and carpet,  leadership needs to stop penny pinching and really care for its staff, because yes I miss working with Tim.< /Text><pics>None</pics><response>None<//response><gmap_id>0x809adfbeb7eebb17:0xcf9c940ad9e667f8<//gmap_id></record>

<Review>Had Reliable Home Improvement installed a concrete driveway they did a fantastic job. I had them back out and did a roof. This is a large roof with the 50-year warranty. Everything as promised totally awesome proof is in the pudding, got to see it to believe it I can't say enough. Joe M is great he brought me cookies multiple times at Christmas time. Joe M envisioned my concerns when it came to my sidewalk and driveway.  I have a difficult time entering and exiting my house with my bicycle.  He put nice curves and widened the sidewalk knowing that would help me.  Again I can't say enough all the crews that were out, here everybody knew exactly what Joe and I had talked about prior . It's almost like they were here when we signed the original contract.  Thanks again Reliable I'll have you out again! They were a pleasure to work with, thank you very much Reliable!< /Review>< Pics>

I want to say thank you to Reliable Home Improvement they came out and did my driveway and Patio in my front yard. I absolutely love it, they were in and out of here in 2 days. They cleaned up everything, they answered all of my questions.  Starting from the gentleman who knocked on my door to the sales consultant that came to my house his name was Joe. He was very informative and made it affordable for me. Again thank you very much Reliable Home Improvement I look forward to working with you in the future and I will pass your information along to my friends and family.< /text>

I started a project of adding new windows to my home.  I called Reliable, they answered all of my questions in  a quick and professional manner.  I had them come out and check out which windows they recommended that I replace.  We agreed on all counts.  Their pricing is very competitive.  I ordered the windows, which were delivered on schedule. The installation of the windows was efficient and  quick.  The appearance of all windows are excellent!  I trust this company, if you have any questions from a client of theirs please contact their office for my phone number.

I had my roof done by Reliable about 2 years ago and my wife and I are still very thrilled. We had wood shake and we knew it needed to be replaced. My daughter referred me to Reliable and Tim Azevedo came out to take measurements and give me a quote. The installation went well and I do not have to worry about my roof anymore. Thank you to everyone at Reliable.<//text>

Sales staff was excellent Tim and Cliff were very helpful with no pressure, everything in the paperwork was understandable. Second measure for our Windows were right on time as promised as well as the install. He said it would be done in a day and a half and he was able to finish our house of Windows in one day from 830am to 4pm. I love the Windows especially my slider with the upgraded lock. My husband and I are very happy customers.< /Text>

If you are seeking a truly “Reliable” group of professional for your home improvement project, look no further! My husband and I could not be more thrilled with Reliable from A-Z. As a teacher, it may be best that I provide my feedback in a more familiar format: “The Report Card”
Professionalism A+
Knowledge A+
Communication A+
Quality of Design and Product A+Z
Workmanship A+

There will be no other company that we would consider consulting with or hiring in the future other than the Reliable team. They were not just professionals – they have become family!<//Text>

<review>My wife and I just had Reliable Home Improvement come out and install insulated siding on the front of our home and we could not be  Happier. I've worked with Professional companies before but Reliable out did themselves. Starting with Cliff getting the paperwork in order then to Gabe and his production crew and even Sean stopping in from time to time was a nice touch as he is one of the owners. We really felt like Reliable cared about us. We will be using reliable again in the future.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None< /Response>< Gmap_id>

The roof was replaced with a lifetime warranty.  It looks beautiful,  I have had contact with 11 different people in person (including two crews and the city's inspector)  and two others by phone.  Everyone has made me feel comfortable.  I was appraised of the schedule before, during and after the roof was completed.<//Text>

<Review>I have had Reliable come out and do work on my home on several occasions over the years.  It started with roofing, then we did dry rot repair, then we had windows changed out, then they did my gutters, and just now I signed up to have the house painted. They use high quality products installed right.  The guys are very professional and very polite and curteous, they clean up after themselves which is very important.  I look forward to working with them again.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None<//resp><GmapID>0x809adfbeb7eebb17:0xcf9c940ad9e667f8< /GmapID></record>

Joe came out to our home about a paint job. He represented Reliable very well. Clean, professional and was very informative. He showed us your insurance and licensing and numerous jobs in the area you have completed. When we are ready to move forward with the paint project it will definitely be with Reliable Home Improvement!</review>

<text>We met with Dave from Reliable Home Improvements and decided to get a custom made driveway. He was extreamly knowledgeable and answered all of our questions. The fact they are a local family owned business makes us feel very comfortable doing business with them. They offer a wide variety of financial options which was incredibly helpful for us and very affordable. I would recommend them to anyone looking to improve their home as they offer many services, big and small.<//text>< Resp>

We were really impressed by the professionalism of their estimator David so we decided to have them replace our back fence. Communication and the quality of work from John couldn’t have been better. I highly recommend this company for all your home improvement needs.<//review>

We just had a new sliding glass door & the siding redone on our house and are beyond pleased with the results!  Jesse went above and beyond helping us decide on materials, color, and financing - our "quick quote" ended up going until after 9pm...

Our project manager, Gabe was great to work with. He stopped by to check in on the project almost every day and was very responsive to phone calls and emails. Russell's crew did the siding and door install and were awesome!  They kept the property clean while they worked and were very patient with my constant questions and inspections.

I've got a lot more projects planned for the house and am planning on using Reliable to help me get them done.<//Review>

I have to share the experience that I had with Reliable Home Improvement. This is my fourth estimate I've had they are not the cheapest and they're not the most expensive, however I promise you they are the most professional and informative out of all of the estimates I've gotten. I'm looking at doing my bathroom remodels. Currently my husband and I are refinancing but I just had to share the experience I had with Joe.  I have a lot of time invested meeting all four of these companies that I have had out here to my house. I have three children and I'm very busy. Reliable showed up early to the appointment they were very respectful to my time and the questions I had, he had all the answers.  Again, I'm just sharing my experience because the other three companies were very unprofessional and were pushy trying to get the deal when the fact of the matter is we are refinancing and we can't do anything at this time. I look forward to working with Reliable and I just want to say thank you!</Review>

I had my kitchen remodeled and love the results.  I would recommend
Reliable Home Improvements.  I'm now working with them to have
a new roof installed.  Everyone along the process were great to work
with.  I will be recommending them to friends and family.</Review>

<Rating>5<//Rating><review>Reliable did a fair amount of concrete work to replace sidewalk and patio in back yard, and to add a large raised bed, also in the back yard.  Work was done professionally and well worked out.  All questions were answered and the work came up to my specifications as well as theirs.  Workmen were prompt, friendly and courteous.  Greg Palmer was the design consultant who worked with me so the plans were what I wanted and what they could and did deliver.  People always ready to answer questions regarding the progress of the job.  A pleasure to work with this company.<//review>< Pictures>

Not only was the work outstanding, but they also left each area where they worked spotless; removed all left over materials, sawdust, etc. Also everyone that I dealt with was not only professional, respectful and courteous, but also prompt in doing the work when they said they would do it.

We had the best experience with reliable. We obtained 4 quotes and reliable was in the middle for those quotes. When we received our quote from reliable Tim came over and was very personable and answered all of our questions. We plan to use them in the near future to get our pool cement redone. I would highly recommend them.</Text>

We were looking to have a new concrete patio poured to replace an old one - and also wanted a small driveway and pad for a shed. We wanted a patio cover as well but weren't sure what we were looking for exactly.  Chris McCarthy helped talk us through what we needed and made us feel confident about our choices. The guys doing the tear-down, pouring, and installation (different teams) were all AMAZING. I can't say enough how professional and great each team was. They communicated with us the WHOLE WAY. I always knew what was happening, and was shown progress the whole time. The Project Manager, Patrick, was there all the way. He made sure everything was being done right, and checked in with us the whole time. We will be using them again.</review>

<text>These guys are amazing. The turf they installed is beautiful and has held up perfectly even with my very active border collie mix running and sliding around on it. The project was completed faster than I expected and worked around my crazy life schedule. They went above and beyond to offer advice on other pieces of the backyard remodel I was doing myself, let me borrow a tool or two, and even helped unload pavers from my car on their lunch break. Jeremy, Patrick, and Chris were all the best to work with and I’d use them again anytime.</text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Date>1517502411755</Date><Response>None<//Response>< gmapID>

Made appointment to have Reliable come out and explain our options on replacement windows & pricing

Followed up by measurement appointment

They were on time the day of the appointment for window measuring.

Windows ordered.

New windows arrived and date setup for install.

Day of install went great. Replacement windows installed old windows hauled away and area cleaned up.

What else can I say, everything went SMOOTH we like the new windows. I can now longer hear my neighbors pool pump running all night and his damn dog barking all night I can now finally get to sleep and yes the new windows are sweet.

Thank You RELIABLE !<//Review>< Pics>

The concrete project that reliable home improvement did is absolutely beautiful! It has changed my life. I had a giant lake in my back yard due to poor drainage and flooding. Joe and Joe both came out and gave me a great solution that looks and functions above and beyond my expectations. We are looking at having our bathrooms done next! Thank you so much!<//text>

We had a great experience working with reliable. Quite frankly we didn't know what to expect as our house had not been painted for over 20 years and there were issues with dry rot.  The Reliable team of Jeff, Gabe, Sean and their support team really came through.

Painting your house is a major long-term investment so we wanted to make sure that we got the most value for our money.  With Reliable we received the the full package --speed, reliability, accuracy -- all delivered with the highest quality.  Including a job change we made to repair siding after the job had started.

This is the place you live there is no point in skimping on something now so that you have to pay twice as much later.  We rate Reliable a 5-star<//Text>

After the renovations done by Reliable Home Improvement, it’s like we’re living in a brand new house! We are going to have more work on our house, and we won’t even consider having it done by any other company than Reliable Home Improvement, and we will recommend them to all of our family and friends.

I started with a contract for a new roof and was impressed with the workmanship and how it was completed in a timely manner. I decided then to discuss installing a patio and concrete work around the backyard which included a portion of synthetic grass. These projects were finished on time to my complete satisfaction and agreed price. The work was completed two years ago and it looks as good as the day they finished. I’ve had no problems. I normally do not give recommendations but I was impressed with reliable’s work. Thank you Tim Azevedo and the rest of Reliable.</review>

These guys are awesome! One of the guys stopped by to make sure that Reliable’s trucks weren’t blocking our driveway and that there wasn’t any debris from the job they had going on next door. I was amazed at the professionalism and that they took the time to come by my house even though they weren’t working on ours. We are not in a position to do any home improvements as of now, but when we do Reliable will be the first company we call.</review>

We had Reliable do interior painting in our home and couldn't be more thrilled with the outcome.  Starting with our painter, Jeremy, who went above and beyond the call of duty!  He painted things that weren't in our contract, because he couldn't stand around and do nothing while something else was drying.  I give Reliable a special thanks for having someone like Jeremy on their staff.</Text>

<review>This is the 2nd of many projects that we plan to do  Reliable Home Improvement. We could not be happier with the service attention to detail and the efficiency in which they installed our  Pro Via entry door storm door and rear storm door project. We would especially like to thank Cliff Ryan Shawn Patrick and of course Wes for all the attention they paid to our project.

Ryan and the crews from reliable have worked on four different houses in our family and over ten projects. From solar to backyards to home renovations to doors and sliders and cabinets; they will provide the best craftsmen to complete your job to perfection!  They will work with you and respect all of your ideas to make your dream home. I know mine is now and so is my other family members homes in the area. Thank you.</Review>

I am very pleased with the work Reliable did for me.  I needed the front gutter and front and side walkway replaced.  They made excellent suggestions for small changes which made the walkways much more pleasing and matched them to the existing driveway.  I am very happy with the way the jobs turned out.</review>

<review>I first became aware of Reliable Home Improvement while attending the Auburn Home Improvement Show.  Their estimates were reasonable (not cheap) but their work was excellent. The young man who came to our house to paint (Jeremy) was meticulous in detail, thorough, and always cleaned up each night.

Jermey assisted me with putting in my order of a new sliding glass door! He is very professional and nice to work with. He also recommended the pet door that my dog DJ will be enjoying and will give me peace of mind that I can leave my home secure and my dog still can go in and out as he pleases. I would high recommend him and Relaible for all my home improvements.
Thank you Jeremy!

I had a disappointing experience with Reliable. While they have lots of staff, everybody friendly, and the work was done quickly, the end result was unflat concrete which doesn't drain well and ponds and has a mottled look; they damaged older concrete which was never repaired or otherwise addressed and a failure to blend the concrete color as I had requested. The finish a few years on is deteriorating, with no apparent remedy. I've had them out a few times, but they have only been willing to do the minimum to address my post-sale concerns. $19K I wish was never spent with this outfit. Shop around, look at older examples of their work, not just recent work.</text>

If I could give no stars I would. I paid 8k for a retaining wall that was not set up according to function. The drainage in my yard was messed with so terribly that the wall they built sits in water year round. They left hundreds of nails sitting in my yard and told me they would come back and break up rock and never did. I regret ever letting this company come to my home to even do a bid! They have created so much fix up work with the thousands I have already paid. So incredibly disappointing!</text>

Let's start with my meeting John, he works marketing for Reliable and he came to my house and kindly without pressure offered me a pamplet and explained what this company offers. I liked him immediately and felt comfortabe talking with him. In steps Joe M., a sales consultant for Reliable. Talk about an honest, upbeat kinda guy. We talked and he measured and came up with a reasonable dollar amount to have my dream patio put in. Long story short. Reliable is honest, they do fantastic work, and they have great communication with each other, but more importantly with their customers. I LOVE MY PATIO! I know I recieved the best deal and best quality. I'm  sincere about this. They worked with me to make it affordable. I sit outside every morning and have a cup of coffee. This patio is in my front yard. I have met so many neighbors I had never met before. All is good in the neighborhood.<//text>

Reliable Home Improvement did and excellent job in repairing the sun/dry rot that curled up the lower edge of the second story plywood sheathing of our house.  The two faux beams on the front of the house were replaced and the exposed stucco was replaced, matching the present form and color. The soffits were professionally replaced like new. The upper damaged plywood was replaced, cleaned and painted the same color as the house. The coordinator of the work crew was most professional in his contact with us to alert us to the arrival of the work crew and the delivery of materials. The workers of the different section of the work order, we well mannered, on time, and communicated to us the progress of the work. All in all, Reliable Home Improvement did an exceptional job in the many areas of the required work. We would be most happy to recommend Reliable Home to any and everyone that needs a great company to do any type of work around their house. Lloyd Pearson.< /Text>

Reliable just completed landscaping our totally barren and neglected back yard. This is our second project with Reliable, having done our front landscape two years ago. The experience and results from that project made it a no-brainer to sign them up again. Tim Azevedo, our Design Consultant from the front-yard project kept in touch with us, knowing that we'd eventually want to landscape the rear yard. When Tim presented us their project proposal, we didn't bother to consider other contractors. Patrick Bedford returned as our Project Manager, and our Reliable team was back in place.

Tim drafted his original design and worked diligently with us to refine features until we had our desired design. As the crew started the initial construction, we came up with a few "tweaks", some required the crew to undo/redo some work. Patrick and the entire Reliable team worked with us, never made an issue over our last-minute changes, and completed
everything that we asked for.

The result is a back yard that is nothing short of a dream! The tinted, stamped, and sealed concrete is spectacular; the poured-concrete curved bench in the back corner makes the ideal setting for a fire pit. The two turf areas punctuate the concrete, giving the space an oasis-like appearance. The custom patio cover completes the space and enhances our house's rear elevation.

There isn't a single spot of this job that we would change. Tim, Patrick, and the entire Reliable team made it two-for-two on our landscaping. We're so happy that we just signed up for the third, and last, piece: driveway and front sidewalk/porch to match the rear yard concrete.< /Text>

I was disappointed when I requested an estimate from Reliable Home Improvement.  To start off the estimator did not even get on my roof, but stood on the ladder and evaluated what needed to be done from there.  Then he said he could measure it from the ground instead of on the roof.  The finally straw was he said they had a minimum they had to charge and my roof was small and only needed like two squares, but he had to charge me for five squares which added over $3000 more than any other estimates I had received.  There is no way I would ever deal with this company again.  I was going to give them a chance to bid on a patio cover and cement replacement of a sidewalk I needed done, but I think they are way too expensive for me.</text>

I had the 25 yr old siding removed from my home, repaired and sealed the old stucco, retextured the stucco and then had it covered with Coolwall energy efficient coatings.  My home looks brand new and we cannot wait to continue the next project.  From Greg in sales to Gabe as my project manager, the entire team worked to make my project a huge success.

Update:  I have had some quality problems in both jobs that were performed at my home.  Reliable has been very responsive, but some things you just can't fix and others I will be stuck with after the 5 year warranty runs out.  They don't appear to self perform any work and I think they need to work on their contractor oversight a bit and be sure that the jobs are being done right, and not just being done such as not filling stucco holes with caulking and not painting in weather so wet that the primer won't dry before the paint goes on.<//Review>

We met reliable at the homeshow. After meeting with Joe S we decided to do a turf project. Roseville is offering rebates and they accomodated our process. Reliable took care of us even when we had questions at the end. Thank you so much Reliable!< /Text>

We hired Reliable Home Improvement (RHI) to re-landscape our front yard into a Sonoran desert theme with desert plants we bought from a southern California nursery. Let me tell you, RHI’s landscaping crew created a horticultural masterpiece. To say they did an outstanding job is an understatement. We get compliments from our neighbors. Victor and his crew are hard workers, they rock, and they got the job done excellently. They installed a sophisticated drainage system and replicated desert soil conditions to help the plants become established. They also installed a new drip system. I highly recommend RHI if you want a landscaping company that will be attentive to any and all details you want in your project.<//review>

<review>Absolutely superior experience from beginning to end.  I found Reliable at the Auburn Home Show and liked what I heard.  We made an appointment and the sales person confirmed and was here on time.  He spent time appraising my roof and came up with an estimate.  I'll be honest that it was more than I had expected, but I realize I know nothing about roofing so had to take his word for it that that was the cost. He explained the quality of their products and what set them apart and that made sense to me.  My roof already had two layers so had to be completely removed before the new tiles were installed.

We scheduled a start date, but, of course, mother nature had other ideas.  We had rain and it ended up starting a month later.  Everyone involved communicated with me and kept me informed.  The people working on the roof went straight to work and did their jobs.  What more could I ask!

Jeffrey Jamison was the roofer.  He worked alone and finished the job in three days.  What a hard worker!  He took time with me to reassure me that I had chosen a quality company and a quality product.  He even helped me re-attach my garage door opener when I had to open my door manually.  He couln't have been nicer and was a pleasure to have working on my home.

The supervisors, Patrick Bedford and Bill Ridings, were in touch by phone and in person before, during and after the project.  I would use their services with no hesitation for other projects.  It was a painless, easy, satisfying experience.

My only "regret" is that I didn't choose a color that was dramatically different from my old one so that my neighbors would notice my gorgeous new roof!<//review>< pics>

Let me tell you why I didn’t go with reliable. It all starts with Tim! At the time I wasn’t able to voice how I was feeling but even after a month now it still bothers me how pushy he was. No means no, but not to Tim, he will keep pushing and pushing. He came to give a quote with his partner. His partner came 3 minutes late, which I didn’t care about at all but Tim had to throw his partner under the bus mentioning it to several times throughout the “estimate”. (I put quotations because it was mainly him berating my fiancée and I the entire time). It is not professional to throw your co-worker under the bus in front of customers, it’s just bad business. First, he took over two hours just to give me an estimate which was extremely unreasonable($4717 I immediately said that was too much so he lowered it to $3497). He badgered and badgered me. I kept telling him I had to think about it and finish getting other estimates. He then proceeded to tell me to sign now and to cancel my other appts. I said I needed time to think about it he said he’d wait in the car and give me a couple minutes. What kind of time is that?! He finally lowered the price to $2665 only because I said I’d pay in full which still was more than I ended up paying with another company. He said several times that I will not find 26 gauge steel anywhere, that they are the only ones to have it. He said I won’t find the quality anywhere. Glad I didn’t cancel my other gutter estimates since I found 26 gauge steel gutters powder coated to the color I chose and the downspouts. All for a fraction of what Tim quoted. I paid $1584 thanks to All About Gutters, I highly recommend their professional and excellent customer service and great prices, not to mention they look great! I’ve been getting complements from all my neighbors, people even stopped to get the company info. It also didn’t take 2hours for an estimate like Tim did. Estimate from All About Gutters took about 20 thorough minutes and I think my actual gutters were installed in a shorter amount of time than Tim took to give the estimate. Just shows the experience some companies have.

The main reason why it still bothers me is because of how personal he took it calling me frugal and cheap and I’m just like all the other Filipino customers!!! What the heck does my ethnicity have to do with anything??? Please just check estimates all around so you don’t get ripped off by Tim and don’t let him bully you into signing like he tried with me.<//Text>

We have used Reliable for several things in our home. New windows throughout, interior and exterior electrical work, attic access and we just finished doing our entire backyard which included ripping up and repouring all of our concrete surfaces and adding a new firepit! They have been amazing on every project. Tim Azevedo is so helpful and knowledgeable! Patrick, Kelly and the owners, Shawn and Ryan are also such a pleasure to work with! The crews have always been efficient and very precise in the work they do. Everyone at Reliable is very responsive and have always strived to do their best and make us happy. We will use them for all of our house projects!<//review>

<Review>I am using Reliable to remodel my kitchen - new cabinets, counter, backslash, electrical and paint.  So far working with them has been so easy and they have accommodated me every step of the way.  Communication has been awesome and they have been really sticking to the tight schedule they set.  I know because they posted a schedule of what happens each week- it's on our fridge.

Hiccup 1 - our gas line needed to be redone from the meter.  No prob.  The contractor let me know right away what needed to be done and fixed it.

Hiccup 2 - they painted the wrong color on the wall.  OOPS!  No prob, they repainted it right away and even threw in a gallon of each paint color for touch-ups.  No pointing fingers, the contractor was very professional and assured me he would take care of it right away and he did.

Hiccup 3 - my son is sick.  No prob.  The contractor said he can definitely work around it and if we need no crew that day it is perfectly fine, we will still be on schedule.  He reminded me that it's my home  and that they will work around my schedule.  The designer even texted me first thing the next day to see if my son was feeling better and if it was ok to have a crew there that day.

Other things to note - I have 2 young kids.  The work area is ALWAYS clean when I come home.  It's also hard to meet before my kids go to bed but the team there was willing to meet with me after work hours to discuss the contract and design.  The materials they use are top quality.  Our cabinets are custom and solid wood with soft close drawers that close like butter.

Conclusion - I love them.  They will take care of you. Would I recommend them?  I already have.  Would I use them again?  They are starting my floors soon.< /Review><pics>None< /pics><Response>None</Response><gmapID>0x809adfbeb7eebb17:0xcf9c940ad9e667f8< /gmapID></record>

They repainted our house and did an excellent job with both the prep and the actual painting. They were very concerned with getting the job done right the first time. A little on the expensive side, but well worth it.

After I posted this review we called the Reliable folks over to do a small repair job, replace 1/2 sheet of dry wall, texture it and repair the flooring.  The flooring and dry wall were just slightly water damaged. They came over and inspected the wall and floor and found no rot or structural damage.  They said they could do the drywall - no problem but would have to check with their "floor guy" on the flooring repair.  They even offered to remove the drywall for free.  After 2 or 3 weeks we heard nothing from them about scheduling or anything.  I called the office and they sent a person out the next day to remove & replace the drywall.  He did fine but we had to wait to have another person come in to do the joint taping and texturing.  Another 2 or 3 weeks went by and I had to call again to get them to send a person to do the taping and texturing.  I then waited about 2 week more and called to ask when the flooring guy would be coming.  At the beginning they told me they were going to check with their "floor guy" Then, after more than a month, they told me they WERN'T GOING TO DO THE FLOORING!  I told them that I would have appreciated being informed of that much sooner so I could have someone else finish the job.

With all the delays and miscommunications on this little fix-up job I was very disappointed with the level of service I received.  I appreciate that there was no charge for the job, but nearly 2 months to do a job that could have been done in less than a few days!  It became very clear that Reliable is a great contractor to use if you have a big job, like $10,000 but if your job is small, they try to fit you in when their people have the time. And if they don't, GOOD LUCK.  Try someone else for small jobs around $1000 or less< /Review>

<rating>4< /rating><Text>I got an iced horchata latte! It was good, not too sweet. I feel like it needed to be a little stronger since I could hardly taste the espresso. Tasted like an horchata with light sweetener and slightly watered down. The flavor was pretty good tho. I got my mom an horchata latte(hot) and it tasted way better than mine.<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None</resp><gmap_id>0x80c291280204858f:0xf0921642200e43cd< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>
<review>Drinks are bomb! I've tried a few and the abuelita frappe and manchado de cajeta hot latte. Horchata frappe is good but more on the sweet side. Mazapan latte hot has pieces of it including peanuts but good. Bought the tinga for my sister and she loved it, not spicy but really good flavor. Churros were not the best but definitely the spot for a variety of Mexican theme/flavored drinks! Four stars only for the churros.<//review>< time>

A great place! The inside looks really nice, the staff are helpful and friendly, and the desserts are unique and delicious. I tried the ore-chata frappe, which was a little bit too sweet and tasted like vanilla with horchata. And also the mocha frappe which was great! Will definitely come here again to get the mocha and try more things.< /Text>

<Rating>4< /Rating><Text>The churros were good. Not my favorite.  Tried the birria torta. Spicy and delicious. Bread was a little over toasted for my taste. Not burnt by any means.
The true star of the show had to be the Oreo Horchata Frappe.  Very refreshing on this hot spring day. The Horchata flavor really came through quite well. The Oreo gave it that gravely look we all know so well. Plus it provides another lair to this already decadent treat. Would visit again to try more drinks from the menu.
And it's right next store to Panda Express. My maps did a poor job of knowing the exact location. Hopefully this helps the next wayward traveler.< /Text><pics>None< /pics><response>None</response><gmap_id>0x80c291280204858f:0xf0921642200e43cd< /gmap_id></record>

I'm reading a lot how they're comparing it to disneyland and etc. Kind of unfair if you think about it

Customer service and food is on point at this place.
Definitely would recommend this place if you're ever around the area for some coffee and churros!< /Text>

<Text>Best churros in town, they make it while you wait, so it doesn’t get better than that.  So many dipping sauces to choose from, but I like then just like that not even sugar on top.  That’s when you know they’re good quality.  Now let’s talk about their coffee, my daughter recommended for me to try their coffee since she was bragging so much about it. Boy she was not kidding!  Their coffee is amazing!!  That why I gave them 5 stars. They earned it.< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None< /resp><GmapID>0x80c291280204858f:0xf0921642200e43cd</GmapID></record>

<Text>So I was told by the cashier the coffee here is from local roasters and did not think much of it until I had the first sip of coffee!!! I could taste the difference in the quality of coffee they serve! My Father enjoyed their Café de La Olla and my kids devoured the churros LOL They also got the Horeochata Frappe and were happy. Nice cafe too.< /Text>< Name>

<rating>2<//rating><name>Salvador Millan<//name><text>The first time I went early morning..the Quesatacos were delicious..the second time however..it was nasty..the Qusatacos were literally filled with GOAT FAT..It was also 5pm..so they probably gave us the leftovers for the goat..Go early or don't go at all..</text>< resp>
{'time': 1620005850291, 'text': 'Mr. Millan,sorry  that you had a mixed experience with us . We try our best to achieve  great tacos that don’t have too much fat but it is a dish that is made  with the fat from the goat broth or beef broth so they can fry and since they also have cheese it tends to make them more greasy. We make new  batches of Birria and Barbacoa fresh  daily , we don’t work with left overs  because we sell out. Our cashier is suppose to inform the client when we ran out of the pure meat which is “Pura Carne “ and tell the client when the  meat that has fat “surtido” in case the client doesn’t like  that type of meat sorry this wasn’t the case. We have clients that like that type meat with fat and clients that don’t so we try to tell them before hand we will talk with the cashier about this matter. We’d love to have you back and give us another try to make your experience a better one ! We will use your feedback and  sincerely work on it . We appreciate your review and thank all our customers that have visited us and tried out food , we value you Greatly , have an amazing day .'}</resp>

<text>I purchased ten tacos and two can sodas with on side of salsa it was 40 dollars. They say they have the best tacos but I wonder. Why there was no special salsa no special ingredients. Just cilantro, onions, salsa and meat. every taco truck uses those Ingredients. So why are yours the best. Even the customer service is bad go there if you want and buy these over priced soggy flavorless tacos.</text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP8ri05-P-gVK3Vravcl2PoslTFiUMSLajN7T26=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures>< resp>

I have a instagram page dedicated to the best places to eat "in my opinion" cause we all like different things and have different taste pallets.  So I have people ask me to go try places and review.  I would shamelessly plug my instagram but chitos deserve all the plugging.  SO SO SO GOOD!  Many options and choices of how you want your Birerria.  They sell real Birerria (goat) not Americanized and sell you beef.  If you are just getting on the red taco or queso taco craze, I highly recommend you visit Chitos first cause I would say with confidence they a real good Gold standard to have a Base of what alot of places are trying to imitate  Americanizing it what caused the growing popularity of the food.  The red taco/queso taco being substituted with beef instead of goat was great for business and making it popular, but the downside is alot of not so great tacos are being made.  Chitos Birerria stuck to the roots, and I feel not being talked about enough!  SO START TELLING YOUR FRIENDS!</Review>

{'time': 1608449402928, 'text': 'Hi, Julie Ruiz , I’m sorry you had a bad experience with us . We try our best to make everything as tasteful and pleasant and keep everything fresh daily . We proud ourselves in making everything from scratch like our soft hand made tortillas. Hand made tortillas are softer and when wrapped will become easier to break since they are made fresh. We also have the option  regular corn tortillas  which will be a better choice if you like a crunchy taco. We offer other meats that don’t include the use of oil like cabeza , Birria, and lengua.  The consistency of our flavors matter and we will take your experience and input to best use and work on it , thanks for your review and honest feedback.  We include taxes like all operating business that pay taxes themselves , taco trucks are not exempt.  We base our prices on current meat prices , which due to current events are higher . I hope\nYou give us another chance and have a better experience . Sincerely b.c.'}</resp>

<Review>We received 4 Different varieties of tacos; 5 langua , 2 chicken, 2 beef , and 1 goat. All the meat tasted the same, each taco lacked stability with the shell falling apart due to the amount of meat on the taco. Quality matters over quantity; in no way, shape, or form should it have costed 30$ for 10 tacos that lack individual uniqueness in flavor . Such large tacos with little flavor for a high price… it would make sense if they tasted as much as they cost.</Review><Gmap_id>0x80905367282b4a29:0x137e4941cbab72c7<//Gmap_id><resp>None</resp>< Rate>

<Review>I don't know if they were having an off day but I had to literally come home and recook and season my lengua. Also not a big fan of the tortillas not being able to hold together. Had to eat my tacos with a fork 🍴< /Review>< Date>

<Review>(Translated by Google) All the food is very good.
What if you have to wait a long time for your order because the tortillas are made by hand. And there are always many customers.
But everything very tasty.

Our driver David was very knowledgeable and courteous and informative and he is to be commended for demonstrating the most excellent driving skills to put his passengers at ease and his customer service skills are second to none!  What a wonderful experience and fantastic day!!  I will definitely recommend Beau Wine Tours to all my friends and relatives.<//text>

Coming to napa in our first visit and not knowing the wineries we hired this tour company to surprise us and help us to arrange everything.

The bad side, after booking, it took about 5 emails in average to get 1 answer from Ashley. The week before our trip I called her 5 times office, mobile, emails, she never got back to me. Never.

They could have done a better job booking good wineries, but I believe they were lazy. Booking 3 wineries that were not the best highlight of the area and the lunch place was just ok. In general a very mediocre job. You can't say they tried to exceed the customer expectations at all. They just didn't try.

We ended up hiring another company next day which took us to highlighted wineries in the area.

On the good side, car was nice and clean and the driver was very professional and on time.

But I would not recommend you to book you experience with them</Review>

<Text>My husband and I made a last minute reservation with Beau for an all day wine tour of Napa on a Saturday.  We provided them with our preferred types of wines and wineries we would like to visit.  Though most were not available due to the lead time needed to reserve tours there, we were pleasantly surprised with the choices made by Steve, our driver. He was very knowledgeable about the region and the wines, and was even able to take us to a winery in Sonoma as we had hoped but didn’t think that could be squeezed into the itinerary. The whole experience was wonderful and we can’t recommend Beau and Steve enough.< /Text><userid>109999851922265948738<//userid></record>

This company is completely unprofessional in the booking process. A woman called to start the booking by asking for a credit card number and said she’d email me the contract to review/sign. Before we completed the booking process or entered into a contract, I noticed 50% deposit already charged on my card.  I did not consent to be charged yet.  I specifically wanted to review the cancellation policy and contract as this was as COVID-19 restrictions were starting to ramp up.  Shortly, a shelter in home was put in place therefore I did not move forward with signing the contract as legally Beau wine tours could not legally render services.  I’ve called and emailed the company multiple times for almost a month with no responses.  Extremely unprofessional to not contact a customer to initiate a refund when a business cannot render services. Advice to other potential customers, ask for written documentation your card will not be charged until the contract is signed before giving them your payment information.<//text>

<Review>My girlfriends and I had a wonderful time with Beau Wine Tours. We decided to spend the day in beautiful wine country with our girlfriend who was getting married at the end of the month. The booking process was so simple, and completed in less than 5 minutes. Our driver, Jeff King, followed up immediately to customize our itinerary, and assist with special requests. He made our day absolutely wonderful. Our vehicle was spacious, comfortable, clean, and stocked with treats. Jeff made sure that each of us were having a great time and comfortable throughout our day. We made a last minute change, and he was extremely flexible. Thank you Jeff and everyone at Beau for making our day unforgettable.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

The winery choices were all fabulous, and Doug, our driver, added to our fun and was just terrific!  It's typically impossible to make 13 people happy, but you did it!    Can't say how much I appreciate Elizabeth Fenn handling all the arrangements and details for us - she made it all so easy.  I sing your praises and am looking forward to recommending your services every chance I get.<//Text><Resp>None<//Resp><user_name>Kathy Eggert< /user_name>< Date>

<Text>Phil Vinci was our driver and he is an absolute jewel.  First of all, he called at least two weeks before our visit to find out what kind of wine we liked and what we wanted out of our tour.  He stayed in touch by phone and email until we had designed the entire 6-hour tour.  I was extremely impressed, and relieved, by this because I had felt overwhelmed at the thought of planning our tour.

Phil couldn't be nicer, friendlier or more knowledgeable about the wineries, wine country and the history of the wine industry in California.  We had a wonderful and relaxing time, and even though he deals with tourists all the time, he made us feel special and very "VIP."  He was also happy to adapt "on the fly" when we stayed longer at a winery than originally intended and to suggest other experiences to help us get the most out of our tour.

It's obvious that Phil and Beau Wine Tours are well respected by the wineries as we were extended every courtesy.  The tour with Phil was the high point of our visit and I couldn't recommend him and Beau Wine Tours more highly.< /Text>< Pics>

<Review>This company is amazing. Top notch service right from my initial booking straight through our tours. Our driver, Hoss, was a wonderful person and added a lot to our overall experience. My wife and I are not used to a luxury like this but it was our 10th anniversary so we splurged and it was worth it....they treated us like gold and made us feel like kings and queens. I highly recommend this company!<//Review>< pics>

We had a four hour tour booked and there were specific things that I wanted to see. When i spoke to my driver he said that the wineries that I wanted to visit were too far away to do in the four hours The staff was very accommodating in changing my four hour tour to a six hour tour. I cannot say enough good things about Peter N., our driver. He was super friendly, very knowledgeable, and really listened to what I was interested in. He was just full of information on our drive to the wineries. He always had a nice cold bottle of water waiting for us when we returned to the Escalade. Peter had lots of suggestions on what wineries to visit and where to eat lunch. Peter came into the castle with us and took some pictures of my husband and myself with my camera that I will treasure forever! It was great living like a rockstar even if it was just for one day!<//Text>

Our driver was absolutely amazing, though I cannot recall his name, but he did tell us he was from  London. He was knowledgeable about the area and knew a lot about the wineries we were visiting as well as versed in many other subjects as well. He was efficient and very kind.
He handled an issue with a winery that "lost" our reservation easily, (we won't be going to Schweiger's again any time soon) and made our travels interesting nevertheless.
Was surprised that they downgraded our ride, though. Our original reservations had us in a limo but I guess a Cadillac will do for a couple of Michigan women. (Ironically, our reservation was lost in favor of a ridiculously skinny girl in an even smaller miniskirt- and her date - in a limo)< /review>

We had a fantastic time with Jay, on the daily wine tour.  He customized the tour to our group's preferences, was very knowledgable, and made it fun!  The picnic lunch was also fantastic!  I would recommend this tour for sure!<//Review>

On our recent trip to Sonoma and Napa we booked two wine tours since we didn't want to drink and drive.  The trip with Beau was our second and by far the best.  It was actually the best day of our vacation!  Our driver Donald was so knowledgeable and planned a great day for us.  He asked us what type of wines we liked and planned the day around that.  We were able to drink with owners and were always taken right away.  We had a fabulous lunch and were never rushed.  We ended up buying 12 bottles of wine and Donald helped us ship them and took care of everything.  He could not have been nicer!  Next time we visit we will use Beau again (I won't mention the other company but there was no comparison!!).</Review>

<Name>Shawn Davis</Name><time>1379939435499< /time><rate>5<//rate><Review>Phil Vinci was our driver and Beau Wine Private Tours needs to base all of their drivers in training on Phil's character. The private picnic setup at a winery of our choosing, was excellent. During our private tour we were educated on history on any of the wineries we asked about, and the history of the entire region.
Now the train ride is a definite event to partake in, in our book. No experience like it! Thank you Beau Wine Tours! We have been very happy with our Napa Valley visit.< /Review>< pictures>

This was our first visit to Napa along with another couple. We hired Beau Wine Tours for transportation and to help guide us. Frank was our driver and exceeded our expectations. He was professional, knowledgeable and new exactly where to take us to have the best experience. He went beyond the call of duty in providing a great atmosphere for our lunch and just making our day special. I think we all agreed that Frank was a big part of our perfect day in Wine Country and we all felt we made a new friend. See you next year Frank!

Phil Vinci from Beau Wine tours made our mother/daughter trip one that we will never forget. We left the planning of our day spend in Sonoma Valley up to him and he picked the perfect wineries for us, as well as a beautiful spot with an amazing view for us to have our picnic lunch at. The personalized service was amazing!<//Text>

My wife and I had a blast on our Collector's Private Wine Tour in Napa Valley!  Our guide was professional and very knowledgeable in Napa Valley Wines.  We purchased wines not available on the open market. Oh, and the food from the "The Girl and the Fig" was delicious. Highly recommend Beau Wine Tours to our clientele and friends.<//review>

<Text>We had such a great time!  We had never been to Napa before, so this was a fun way to see 4 different wineries all while being chauffeured around in a limo!  Not only did we get to taste many wines, we also got to see how the wine is made.  Our driver, Jay, had everything taken care of.  The limo was fully stocked and when we finished at our 2nd stop, he had our lunch all served up and ready for us.  We went with 2 other couples that we met that day, and had a blast with them!  It was a great way to spend the day!<//Text><Pics>None</Pics><response>None<//response>< Gmap_id>

My wife and I recently booked beau wine private tours and had such a great time with Damon Mushrush, our driver. He was down to earth, friendly and exceptionally knowledgeable. Damon was excellent at picking different wineries as well as pointing out diverse and unique aspects of the Napa Valley. I would definitely take another tour.</text>

<review>I would recommend any one thinking of taking a private tour to strongly consider booking with Beau Wine Tours. We had the MOST amazing driver, Phil Vinci. My boyfriend and I are from Michigan, this trip was the first time we have ever been to California, so we knew nothing about the area. To make matters more difficult - we both enjoy wine, but have never been on any tours and really didn't know what we liked. Phil, was hands down the best tour guide/driver we could have possibly been set up with. His extensive knowledge of the Napa Valley/Sonoma area was truly amazing. It was funny at the end of our 8 hour day with Phil, both my boyfriend and I commented on how not once during the trip was the radio on in the car and we never even noticed. It was SO amazing just talking to Phil and learning about the wineries, the area and his experiences. Knowing that we were new to the whole wine tasting/tours he told us SO much about what to expect. He picked out an amazing first winery knowing that the people doing the tasting there were perfect for newbies like us! They were so amazing at explaining the different tastes and kinds of the wines, definitely gave us a great foundation for the rest of the day. The next time we are back in the area we will book another tour and request Phil no questions asked! Thank you Beau Wine Tours and a very special thank you to Phil for making it such an amazing day to remember!!< /review>< date>

<review>Worked with Beau tours to arrange a day of tastings and a place to propose to my (now fiance). Reservation was quick and painless. In less than a week, Phil Vinci pulled together an amazing itinerary, and worked with a winery to set up a private table in the vineyard for me to propose. Wines were superb, all small wineries with great people.

Cars was imaculate and even came with a cooler to keep our wine purchases. Phil is knowledgable and went out of his way to cater to us.

Phil and Beau made a perfect day come true for us!!!!</review>< pics>

<Text>Beau was simply amazing. My wife and I went to Sonoma to tour some pinot vineyards, and booked a car through Beau. They immediately gave us a list of places based upon our tastes, but we ended up deferring to a local friend of ours on which vineyards to hit.

Everything about the trip was perfect. Our driver, Gabriel, was incredibly nice and attentive. We could go when we wanted, detour as we liked, and he was there to help. The car was immaculate.

We ended up hitting several vineyards, and Beau even arranged a private one-on-one tasting with Liocco, which was icing on the cake.

Highly recommend these guys. A+</Text><UserId.>104854323473563426266< /UserId.><name>Tripp Watson<//name><Rating>5< /Rating>< pics>

<text>If you are planning a trip to Napa or Sonoma, I highly recommend Beau Wine Tours and ask for Cindy to be your driver/concierge! From the moment we booked our private car she was in contact. Took our winery wish list and customized an itinerary, coordinated all our our tasting reservations and arranged for a gourmet picnic lunch on the go to maximize our time. Had amazing knowledge, snuck in some gems for us to run in and see, and treated us like VIP friends. Amazing, cannot say enough. Already booking Sonoma with her in the Spring!<//text>< pictures>

<Review>We had a disappointing experience with Beau.  We booked a car to take us to three wineries, including lunch.  Our emphasis was to be on Napa red wines.

The first stop was perfect.  The winery was an outstanding choice - wines of very high quality presented by knowledgeable and interested staff.  A great morning.

The second stop was to include lunch.  Instead, it was a "food pairing experience" which provided five tiny food tastes to go with the selected wines.  In total, the tastes did not add up to an hor d'oeuvre much less a lunch.  Also, the vineyard had relocated only a few years ago, so they hoped to be able to produce estate-quality wines in a few more years.  In the meanwhile, they were focused on "the experience" until their wines improved.  Obviously not at all what we were looking for on either count.

The third stop was a winery that had nothing whatsoever set up for us - they didn't even know we were coming.  Apparently they told Beau that we didn't need a reservation for a basic tasting.  The wines available to taste at the "no appointment" tasting were not at all what we were looking for - we tried one or two to be sure we weren't missing a hidden gem, and then left.

The driver took us across the road to a fourth stop in an effort to make up for the problems at the second and third wineries.  We appreciated his efforts, and the fourth winery did have some interesting choices worth investigating.

Bottom line: the exceptional experience at the first winery made the day worthwhile overall, and the driver was pleasant and enjoyable.  Based on Beau's reputation, though, we had expected better.< /Review>< pics>

{'time': 1461800790028, 'text': "We are very sorry to hear that your tour was not up to your expectations. We do our best to gauge the criteria of our clients and to create an itinerary that truly compliments them. We can always leave room for spontaneity, and typically usually book two appointments for our guests at wineries if there are no specific winery requests given to us.\n\nI would like to say that usually we like to have at least a week to prepare for our guests, with time to work with your tour guide or concierge, when there are expectations and interests on a higher end scale such as you stated. You booked with us in the late afternoon of a Saturday with a tour to be executed the following Monday. This gave us one full Sunday (typical days that hospitality managers at wineries are not in) to come up with something that we believed you would enjoy. Without any specific requests, again, we made two appointments for you and then planned for walk-in tastings and spontaneity with our knowledgeable drivers. This is also not to mention, that with this little time, some of the higher end experiences and locations that you may have enjoyed more would not have been available due to being sold out.\n\nAt the second winery, some people do believe the food and wine pairing to be enough food, others find it to be not enough. With the timing we had, and the ability to open up the rest of the day to you with your chauffeur after this experience, we would have been happy to provide you a location that could offer a little more to eat, and picnic at another winery with wines the driver would understand to be to your liking. The description you gave of B Cellars isn’t a typical one we receive. Many of our guests have really enjoyed their wines and atmosphere. The experience does speak for itself, and was something that your reservationist believed would suit you well, given the little time she had to plan for you. Their caves are gorgeous, their art is unique and fun. Their full kitchen tasting room is exceptional and their garden shows off how freshly they source their ingredients. Though, with this said, not all wineries are for everyone, and we apologize that you didn't enjoy this one.\n\nMiner Family, again, is a walk in experience. Without knowing any specific wineries, we opted for a more casual walk in experience that would offer you a wide variety of wines that get very high scores and speak to many palettes. Most do not consider Miner family to be sub-par. Again, not every winery is for everyone, and your chauffeur did his best to learn more about your true interests on the fly so as to make up for the two wineries you did not enjoy. Again, we do our best and did our best with the time we were given.\n\nThank you again for your business. It is very much appreciated and we do take our product very seriously. As I noted to you directly, I would still love to discuss this experience further with you so we can see where we could improve for these types of last minute requests. We are a company that does truly believe  that there is room for improvement, and maybe there was a little more we could have done to find better wineries to fit your interests with better questions or the like. We hope that next time you come to the valley, you give us another chance and allow us a little more time to fine tune an itinerary that will really cater to all of your interests. Your feedback truly matters.\n\nChristina Zanone\nReservations & Affiliate Manager\n707.732.4804"}<//resp>

<Text>We had an awful experience $600.00+++ worth,  with Beau Wine and Limousine on December 28 2015.  I have waited to write this review..., waiting to have my call to the customer service  manager (Christine) to be returned , but she still has not and at this point am not expecting her to bother.

I am writing this so this doesn't happen to anyone else.
1.  Communication was poor from the beginning, so poor that I asked to have another "tour specialist" take us.
2.  We were shuffled to another driver the day before the tour date.  I found this out via a voice mail (remember we were on vacation)
3.  The other driver wasn't from the area, couldn't answer any of our questions and basically drove us from point A to B and took our pictures  all for  $ 600.00
4.  We were supposed to have appointments at all 4 wineries.  Only one had been scheduled so we could only do tasting at the other 3. And we were late for the only one that was scheduled!
5.  The lunch we had pre-ordered was never ordered.  Our driver went back to get the lunch after asking us "what we wanted"  When I attempted to "settle up" with him later for lunch he said "no problem, I used your credit card on file"  (that credit card has now been cancelled !)  Thanks for that added hassle BWT &LS!!!!
6.  The driver was late picking us up, he did call but it made us late for our first (and only ) tour.
7.  The next day we hired a UBER to take us to the wineries.  For about $7.00 each ride, we never waited, had a pleasant driver who KNEW and TOLD us more trivia than you can imagine!  Highly advise this to anyone touring Napa!

It was a family emergency that pulled her off your tour the night before, and we could not change that. I also regret any poor miss-communication with our concierge during the planning stages. We do try and give every guest the utmost attention and care, and it seems we dropped the ball somewhere. Just to be clear, our drivers do not have access to our customer's credit cards. The transaction was handled securely by our office, after your driver called in the lunch order. You did in fact give our office authorization, and signed a form specifically for such extra services on your behalf. I would like to make these mishaps up to you, the next time you are in wine country. Feel free to give me an email before your next trip, and I will personally see that we exceed your expectations.\n\nBest regards,\n\nThomas Buck\nBeau Wine Tours\ntom@beauwinetours.com"}< /response>

<text>Anyone interested in having an awesome experience in Napa, hire Beau Tours and ask for Donald Buxton!  From day one to day three, he kept us informed and entertained.  We visited many wineries/ vineyards throughout the AVAs.  Although it was raining some days, the views of the places we visited were outstanding.  The wines were superb.  Listen to Donald, let him set your itinerary and just relax and soak up the fun.  He has 40+ years’ experience in Napa, he grew up there and knows the owners and is well respected within the industry.
AVA's we visited, Spring Mt., Howell Mt., Stags Leap, Rutherford, Coombsville, St. Helena, and Carneros, plus more, I am sure.  At the end of our trip, Donald became family.  I am sure, if you choose Beau Tours and Donald Buxton, you will not go wrong.<//text>< Rate>

Went out to San Fran for a week and we knew we wanted to take a day trip to Napa.  I researched options and continued to see good things about Beau Wine Tours.  The booking process was very simple and the communication great.

I worked with Dean on our itinerary and he recommended several wineries that were close to our "must stops" and also a great place for lunch.

Our tour was 9/22/13 and Mark picked us up at our hotel in San Fran.  He arrived early and we got our day started.  The car was a brand new XTS and was extremely clean.  We had some extra time after our first stop and Mark recommended a winery very close to our second stop of the day Caymus.  Mark's recommendation of Frog's Leap was one of the high lights of the day.  What a beautiful winery and relaxed atmosphere.  Even though we didn't have an appointment they made us feel like VIPs.

Thanks Beau WIne Tours and thanks Mark our driver for making our first visit to Napa such a great day.< /Review>

<rating>5<//rating><Text>My wife and I were heading to Sonoma, CA for our 10th wedding anniversary.  We arrived in San Francisco to visit friends and chose to get to Sonoma and have our first tour of vineyards ever in this area.  I told Craig at Beau that we were wine neophytes and he hooked us up with guide Damon Mushrush and he balanced our tour and made it an intimate learning experience by first taking us to smaller vineyards (Hunter and VJB) and then Berlinger where we got a complete tour of the facility and learned each step in winemaking and the advantages of biodynamic farming.  We had a fabulous experience and I can recommend this company and Damon without reservation (although you'll need one in advance to make sure you get him).< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None< /Response><Gmap_id>0x8085a9298a89605b:0xb88d299ff9d6c3bf<//Gmap_id></record>

<response>{'time': 1412976079379, 'text': 'Thank you for your feedback. We are often hired to provide shuttle services to and from winery sites or private estates, to limit the amount of traffic their access roads receive during an event. We do in fact check to be certain our vehicles can safely maneuver the roads and clearances, trying to minimize the impact on surrounding neighbors. Unfortunately, we cannot always avoid every scenario, and we try very hard to follow standard "rules of the Road" when asking other vehicles to back up. We always place safety as our number one priority. Again, thank you for your feedback.'}</response>< Date>

< review>
two times they got my order wrong and my boyfriend had to drive here again to get the order:
1. first time I ordered 2 sandwiches and 2 drinks, when I went home and opened the bag, there is only one sandwich.
2. second time I got 2 drinks and blueberry hearty oatmeal, when I went home and opened the bag there is NO OATMEAL, noly blueberry and the nut package.
I know you guys are busy but please check the order before you hand to customers, feels so mad since we have to drive to your store two times to get the right items.< /review>

My drink had ice all the way to the top and hardly any liquid. I will never understand why so much ice and such little liquid. I’m paying for a venti drink not a grande. Please don’t overload the ice. My ice was literally all the way to the top. I didn’t realize until I took 4 sips it was pretty empty already. I was like what’s wrong and I realized the ice was full!so disappointed.<//review>

Whoever assigned to make the food for customers was a lazy barista. I ordered an oatmeal. She handed me a bag. When I got home, the oatmeal was not made at all. In other words, there was no hot water so the oatmeal was just plain dry and rough. I had to wait for 2 hours to have my breakfast because there was no microwave near where I was and stayed hungry working. This really upset me. If your worker does not want to work, then let them stay home. Dont make customers suffer because of your poor work ethic, please.<//text><Response>None<//Response>< userid>

This is the only Starbucks in my area that serves the crispy grilled cheese. The staff is always so nice, except for one girl. It never fails whenever I get her, my drink is ALWAYS messed up. There have been several times where I've ordered a GRANDE vanilla iced coffee with an espresso shot and When I get to the window it's in a venti cup. I tell her it was supposed to be a grande and she says "oh well you can have this one, its bigger and the shot is in there" not knowing it DEFEATS THE PURPOSE OF ME GETTING A SMALLER CUP WITH AN ADD SHOT. I WANT TO feel the shot haha.< /text>

This is the slowest Starbucks in the San Gabriel Valley! 7:45am with 6 people behind the counter... It took 15 minutes for me to get 1 frapp and 1 iced coffee, and still my order wasn't right. I can't put full blame on the new girl, who didn't know how to use the register nor find the right ingredients. There is zero communication at this place and drinks just sit around.<//text>

I don't think that taking down one drink is that hard, I was just here at drive through @7:12 am / February 8, 2018. I ordered a white hot chocolate mocha BUT requested without the mocha, you have to order it like this just to get a white hot chocolate. I repeated myself 3 times to make sure it is without the mocha, I just wanted a white hot chocolate (which I ordered this before and was told to say it like this too.) The girl said yes, that's the name for the drink.
SMH when I got my drink it had mocha inside. SHE ONLY HAD 1 JOB to get 1 drink correct. Unfortunately this location just opened, they don't have a phone  number listed yet for me to get her name.  Needing to get to work I didn't bother to wait around for her to do her job right. LISTEN to your customers, take down the right drink order and get it done  correctly the first time. Maybe she needs more training or learn the drink menu better.< /Text>

Staff is very friendly but its not enough to keep you coming back especially when theres locations nearby with an actual lobby in stead of some 4 rickety seats outside.
Stopped coming to this location due to how inconsistent the espresso comes out. One day its amazing but the next i swear im drinking an old decaf shot.
Also stopped coming because the exit of the drive thru had some how went from a smooth exit to there being a massive pot hole that would make my car scrape as i left with not way to avoid it. (Not sure if this was resolved but was a problem for a few months.)</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None< /response>< GmapID>

My house is couple minutes drive to this starbucks location, so i come here regularly. One day around 8ish, i was ready to order Medicine ball because I’ve been feeling sick that day, but first i need to wash my hands because i just changed my tire. My hands was really dirty that time. So, I asked the store manager if I can use the restroom to was my hands, but  she said “ you can’t  use the restroom its not a public restroom.” she told me if I want , I can go to Home Depot to wash hand.Ive been coming to this starbucks, and i comes to Home Depot very often so i know other customers  using the restroom. I reload my starbucks apps hundreds of dollars a year and can even let me use the restroom to my wash hands?</review>

Big selection of menu items. Had the colossal pastrami burger, tasty. Friend had the pastrami burrito which was delicious and different. Will be back to try breakfast and a few other dishes.< /Text>

Excellent Greek style short order burger, Mexican and gyro style place. Comfortable seating, bright and open.  Maybe a little challenging to get a wheelchair in there, but not impossible with help. Food is predictably good.<//text>

<text>Obvious goodies/classics like bacon cheeseburger and curly fries.
But also the Gyro was awesome!
Fried zucchini was perfect 👌 Cut to the right size for the best veggie to breading ratio and good ranch< /text><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< gmap_id>

Drive thru was empty, so I was greeted immediately and placed my order. When my order was repeated back to me through the intercom box, I couldn't understand a single word that was said, it was completely distorted.
Drove around to the pick up window and there was a car/customer waiting for their order, which took a little over 10 minutes. They left and I pulled up to the window to pay and pick up my food, that was already sitting there waiting for me! That's not good!
My order of 2 cheeseburgers, 2 fries and onion rings was $19.67.  Wow... Really??   They offer a family pack of 4 burgers, 4 fries and 4 drinks for $19.99.  My order was half of that and no drinks! What a joke! I got home quickly (less than 2 miles & all green lights) but the food was barely warm and the burgers were vertical in the bag with the fries on top of them, they were a bit smashed but they still tasted good and hit the spot. The onion rings were perfectly crispy fried.< /Review>

If you love a tasty and monstrous burger, the Herculian Burger will make you fall in love with it. It's literally one of the biggest and tastiest burgers of my entire life. Be warned though: it's not recommended for amateurs</review>

They asked me to repeat my drive-thru order 6 times and got it wrong every time; when I tried to correct it at the payment window by adding the item they left off, they told me I would have to go through the drive through again ...  we spend $40 to $ 80 a week there, or at least we used to...  unbelievable<//text>

<review>Food is good, but not better than Johnie's Jrs..... the last couple times we've gone, they messed up my order. Time before last I ordered a grilled chicken sandwich, they gave me a fried chicken patty sandwich. When I called to request the correct sandwich be made, they made it seem like it was my fault because they call it a chicken breast sandwich, that is... you guessed it, grilled. It indeed is a grilled chicken sandwich haha.  Okay. Now we just went there this last Saturday, sat at the speaker for longer than 7 minutes and got no one, so I drove up and there was a car at the window. I called to place my order because I noticed there was a car behind me and i didn't want them to wait too long. I call, they answer, I explain the situation and tell them I'd like to order. Immediately, idk why you didn't hear anyone, we are here, you should have waited. Haha I did wait, we thought the speaker might have been broke. I ordered a side of sour cream to put on my tacos and they put a big blob of sour cream right in the middle of the chili cheese fries we had ordered. My man doesn't eat sour cream so he wouldn't touch it. I didn't bother calling to complain because I'm tired of it being my fault my order is wrong when I know i ordered my order how we want it. So Johnies Jr will be our go to place. We would only go to hercules when we are lazy because they have a drive Thru. Sad because their food can be good if it's right, I don't understand what happened. Our order problems started around 2 months ago.</review>< Pictures>

First they tried to charge tried to charge me $35 for two orders of chilli cheese fries with pastrami. When I questioned them about the price the lowered it to $23. When I get home I noticed there wasnt much pastrami on top. They put extra extra salt in my food, I didn’t notice till about halfway when my fingers started to tingle and I was very thirsty. The second order was the exact same. This place is empty for a reason people stay away!!!</Review>

They have a drive-thru but you can also go in and order and take your did to go. Since we went at night, this place is well lit and there weren't any people just hanging out. Inside was clean and bright. Plenty of seating once we're able to eat inside again. Also lots of seating outside for a nice warm day. The young lady at the counter was very welcoming and friendly. I ordered a hamburger special with grilled onions, fries and a drink. Hubby ordered chili cheese fries, bacon burger and a drink. Sorry we were hungry so we forgot to take pics lol. Food was hot, fresh and very good. The chili cheese fries were a large amount for under $8. My husband was very satisfied. They also have family meals for 5 under $25. That will be a must do when we bring the kids. Plus I want to try the pastrami. If you're in the area and need a good burger with hot fries make a stop. Give them a try! 🤗</review><Name>Queen C< /Name><userid>112013140851899684814</userid><rating>5< /rating>< response>

<Review>Let me start by saying the prices are not what I wanted to be paying. But, I'm rating this on the fact that the pastrami burger was one of the most phenomenally amazing burgers I've ever eaten. I highly recommend eating here. Everyone really enjoyed their food and I'll definitely be eating here again.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures><GmapID>0x80dcda10a1337483:0x43950ee3877a54b5</GmapID>< user_id>

Love their egg breakfast burrito. It's just under $4 and very large. I usually save half or share it! It's my go to drive through quick meal. It's served all day. I haven't tried anything else there. It's just so good.<//Text>

Another burger joint in the city of Orange. Hercules is alright, not great neither terrible. I got chicken tacos and honestly it would've been awesome but some of the chicken had bone and some had fat ( like chewy) it was shredded chicken marinated in some sort of salsa roja, on two corn tortillas,  lettuce, pico de gallo, cheese and salsa verde. The salsas were good. Prices are moderate it depends on what you order. 3 stars, check it out and let me know if you agree with this rating!<//text>

This place was great. The food was good, the service was fast and friendly and helpful. The one thing I really liked was the menu, it was huge !! So many choices almost too many. Our overall experience here was great. I would definitely recommend trying this place out !!</review>

Stopped by to test the hamburger combo, not quite what I tought would be, hamburger pretty much tasteless, couldn't finish it, ate the fries because I brought it home, I would say waste of money, don't think I would go there again<//Text>

Food is always good. Love the 2 jr burgers for $4 deal, but everything I've tried from the menu is great and reasonably priced Usually pretty big portions too. Especially the breakfast combo meals.< /text>

I like this place they have good stuff, but so many times they mess my order up. I always ask for no cheese bc I'm lactose intolerant and for some reason they keep adding cheese to my order. Two stars bc they have good food, but mess up my order the majority of the time.<//Review>

Food is good, tables need to be wiped more often. Each time I came here same thing. Coffee doesn’t come around for refills. 6 tables need wiping, unacceptable. That’s management not training their staff properly.
Staff is friendly and food arrives quickly.<//Review>

Good burger's. The family meal deal is cheaper than buying the meals separately. 5 burger's, 5 fries, 5 soda's for $20. If bought separately they would cost about $7 each.</Text>

<Review>This place is definitely in the hood but sometimes this is where you find the best food.  I haven't finished it chili burger and small chiil fries. Ooooh so good. I usually wait to finish before I post but it taste that good. The staff was very friendly and when I told her it was my first time they have this bell that she started ringing kinda embarrassing but fun. They seemed to really enjoy their job. I haven't finished it but if the ending is like the beginning I will be back.  I didn't look at the entire menu I already knew what I wanted and it is high calorie but maybe next time I will look and they may have something lower in calorie. I asked for to go menu but unfortunately they didnt have it but this is a really good burger taste and appearance.  (Kinda greasy) but damn good</Review>< resp>

<Review>I kind of miss Dukes. But this place is cool. It has that typical Diner style taste and vibe to it much like Fantastic Cafe or Omega Burger. Reasonably priced menu.< /Review>< Response>

I do like this place my special is the pastrami sandwich and fries but typically their fries are frozen their pastrami sandwiches very very good but pastrami sandwich and fries and an iced tea comes out to about 13 bucks I mean come on folks really most of their dinner specials are really good I would suggest the pork chops that comes with soup or Salad comes with onion rings or zucchini you can get a combination of a couple different types of sides and comes with the role and couple pork chops and usually runs around 11 or 12 bucks that's really the best deal they got going< /Text>

Typical hamburger joint. Dukes, omega style. Few TVs in this place. Nice enough staff. Good is decent but nothing you would travel for. My last experience was micro problemic. Asked for steak and egg burrito... Young last didn't hear me say steak. Had i not been eating in... I would have been much more upset later. They fixed the issue.. It only cost me extra $2 and 5 minutes of my morning. Overall decent and good vibe.</Review>

The food was surprisingly filling, but the servers who worked at the drive thru yesterday kind of seemed off. We added Hercules Fries to our order since I thought it looked pretty good from the advertisement they had displayed just before the window. It took a good minute before we got our meal, which wasn't a big deal. She gave us an overly stuffed bag of food and closed the window. I am a huge advocate of checking my food before driving off. I noticed that they forgot to give me the Hercules Fries and we waited for her to come back to give us the rest.

I turned to the window and saw her with her coworker with a confused look on her face.

She was probably wondering why we were still waiting and proceeded to ask us if we needed anything else.

We mentioned that they forgot our Hercules Fries and she said everything should be there.. we had regular fries with a meal we ordered and my boyfriend explained that the regular fries obviously wasnt the Hercules Fries.

She then apologized and told her coworkers that we needed those fries.

I don't know if it was loud inside, if she spoke low or they were all deaf, but it was kind of cringey and awkward to watch her struggle to tell her coworkers to give us our fries.

We got home after getting our entire order and found that the fries did not come with pepperccinis. My boyfriend is a huge fan of those and was a bit disappointed. In spite of the entirely awkward encounter at the drive thru, I think what stood out the most was the Hercules Fries. The other items we order were pretty good for what it was, but those fries are what I think I'll be coming back for.</text>

COFFEE; tastes like they're using tap water, and seems to have flavor of old, burnt coffee.

The experience was terrible, I had to al for my money back after watling more than 30 minutes. Once I did the mánager was rude and toldo me she didn't have time for me. She slammed the money on the counter and she also grabbed the receipt From my hand in an aggressive Way. This was done even after I pointed out that I was not Being rude or giving her attitude. She is usually the one working the cash register.</Review>

I love Hercules burgers they're in my neighborhood there around the corner from my house and let me tell you something no matter if you want something simple or something three-course four-course meal they can do it nothing comes out of that kitchen that isn't good and I live I've lived in the neighborhood for 15 years and you can count on them for a good meal breakfast lunch or dinner</Review>

Awesome. Read the reviews and passed this place but only had 10 dollars so decided I didn't want the very best, I want cheap.  They had a picture of a 2 burger special for $3 so I figured they were sliders and I would need all $10 in burgers. When the very friendly girl passed me the bag it was so beavy i knew i had scored.  6 full sized burgers with a ton of fresh lettuce a tomato, a pickle and thousand island standard.  I am sitting at a dog park parking lot with half a sack of burgers and writing my first fast food review.  Maybe my expectations were so low, but I this was the best fast food experience of my life.  So just remember that you don't want the very best, you want cheap and they GOT cheap.</Review>

<review>I have always liked this local restaurant, even when it was called Dukes. The prices are fair and the food is good. If I had to make a complaint it would be about the fries, they are pretty bland. No amount of salt or ketchup can save them.<//review>< UserId.>

<review>I had an avocado omelette with a side of the  ranchera sause. The sause was pretty mild compared to their normal spicy sause but the rest was great, the place is clean, the staff is very friendly and when we told the girl she talked to the cooks. Can't ask for more than that.<//review>< user>

<Review>I use to love this place before it was changed to this Hurcles so I decided to take a bite. And it was my worst experience. I paid for a burger that was 9.99 called the Hercules Burger? Not even a drink include. The prices are not well. I miss my .99 Burger I had at this previous place. Shall not come again.< /Review>< pictures>

They supply a wide range of food from gyros, to sandwiches to burgers to breakfast.  Think a classic greek diner with a drive thru.  Decent food and a better alternative than the chain fast food outlets.</Review>

< review>
Came here for first time... Sucked. My mom ordered the chicken fajita special and it consisted of little chopped chicken with a lot of veggies, rice, beans and lettuce with thousand island dressing on top.... Not worth the 8-9 bucks.. I asked for more pickled carroits since the bar was out. And the girl was like "oh there isn't anymore ay the bar?" I said no.. I sat with my mom.. about 5 mins later my burger special came out.. not bad.. then waitress brought out my carroits... Wtf.. like 10 small pieces of pickled carroits.... Never again well I come here<//review>

<Review>(Translated by Google) first and last time, I will never return. I paid for a dish, It came with soup and the soup never arrived and the dish NOTHING TO SEE WITH WHAT I SHOW THERE. I drink tastes the jumbo shrimps.

First and last time, I will never return. I paid for a plate, which came with soup and the soup never arrived and the plate NOTHING TO DO WITH WHAT THEY SHOW THERE. I never saw the big shrimp. And hard rice.

< review>
(Translated by Google) Yesterday was my first visit to that place, and the truth came out unpassionate, the place is very dirty the tables all the same is the bathroom, it seems they do not know what things they should use for cleaning, and it seems that there is in the bathroom and sink of Hands have never used chlorine. Please, the cleaning staff strives more to make that place clean, so that families and anyone who arrives there will return happily, and not go out of this dirty place. Thank you.

(Original)
Ayer fue mi primer visita a ese lugar, y la verdad sali desepsionada ,  esta muy sucio el lugar las mesas todo e  igual esta el bano, parece no saben que cosas deben de usar para limpieza, y parece que hay en el baño y lavabo de manos nunca han usado cloro .Porfavor los encargados de limpieza esfuerzense mas en que ese lugar este limpio, para que las familias y toda persona que llegue ahi regrese feliz, y no se vayan desepsionados de ese lugar tan sucio. Gracias.<//review>
