<Review>I recently was in a major traffic accident & was traveling from Ventura to Reno NV on 8/24. I was starting to feel an ear infection coming on & was also in a lot of pain from the accident itself. My provider was Linda. She was sooo thorough & empathetic & understood I had a long drive ahead of me. She was very professional (as was the entire staff), prescribed what I needed & gave me a shot for pain, so I could get on my way. I retired from a healthcare facility after 28 years so I know a good one when I come across it! I'd recommend this urgent care to anyone.  Good job!

I went there today.  I was told it was an hour and half wait in my car.  They wouldn't even open the door for me. Every patient has to go to their car, and call them from inside the car, so you can start to check-in.  Then they'll hand you the clipboard through the door, and you have to wait in your car at 100 degrees.  I don't think they want to work.</Review>

I went to summit urgent care a few weeks ago.. with chest pain/back pain from a gnarly electric scooter accident... this place was fast! And I thought efficient. Uh no. They took X-rays of my chest and side.. dr came said my spin was knocked out of
Alignment and the X-ray looks good.. and if there’s a problem they will call. And suggested I see a chiropractor. Well I saw a chiropractor that week and the pain was bad I cried.. never got a call from the X-ray results. Well cat scan later I have a broken rib. Thanks a lot for the chiropractor suggestion. And the muscle relaxer that combo is real good for a broken rib.. I can’t even.. I literally can’t even give you a A for effort.< /text>
<Pics>None</Pics><Response>{'time': 1624417032878, 'text': 'Amy, sorry we have not replied to you sooner, but this situation was discussed.  First, X-Rays are not perfect and small rib fractures are not always easy to see.  X-Rays are also never as accurate as a CAT scan, which gives you a lot of radiation in fact.  We did not call because further discussion was not warranted based upon results.   A muscle relaxer is intended to provide relief from muscle spasms, due to spine issues, which was the initial diagnosis.  If you were concerned or in pain, we wish that you had called us.   We hope that you are feeling better now.'}</Response><Gmap_id>0x80c258263cd45223:0x3484396f6a287849<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I was nervous about coming here based on some of the reviews. But this is the urgent care covered by my insurance. Everyone there was very nice, especially considering how much they had going on. The phones never stopped ringing while I was there but they still remained calm and professional. I never once felt rushed. They were thorough and I felt like they listened.< /Review>

<Review>I am happy to say that I was seen within 20 minutes of arrival. The staff was very informative and quick to remedy the situation for which I was being seen. I felt comfortable and no one treated me as if they had their hand on the door as if in a hurry to go to the next patient.  That level of care and compassion is sadly rare these days . I had a check up the following day that was brief and free of charge. The fees for cash patients are extremely affordable.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

I’ve visited them on the past and was satisfied with the level of treatment, but now with Covid-19 regulations Drs are not taking or seeing anyone who presents any Covid symptoms before having a Covid test done with negative results. So, In another words, they’re  an urgent care for I don’t know what, ear infection only I guess anything other like flu symptoms,  you’d have to visit the ER 🙄.</Review>

Dont go if you have any type of chest pain because these doctors dont treat chest pain .
I had mild headache and sometimes my chest hurt when I took a deep breath. I figured get a quick xray see what's going on in the lungs but nope .
They  wont even let you threw the front door due to covid . Really be a doctor do your job and treat patients if you thinks its life threatening then send them to the ER but atleast treat or diagnose a patient. Before just saying no.<//Review>

Usually they are  good, but tonight took my son there at 7pm and he was severely dehydrated! They said that they cannot treat him because it would take too long and that their boss will get mad at them for overtime!!!! They close at 8pm!

I have taken myself and 3 of my immediate family members there for care a couple of time each for different issues and am overall completely satisfied with the facility. It is clean and the staff and Doctors are wonderful.  Easy in and out and that what we like.  Just moved to the AV a few months ago and I will recommend Summit Urgent Care to everyone.</Text>

Talk about friendly and efficient. We were seen within five minutes. An x-ray was taken to be sure of the situation. My wife was given a injection of antibiotics to be sure that her condition improved as quickly as possible. We were blown away when we received a phone call the following day from the clinic to see how she was doing. I would recommend this clinic to anyone that is in need of medical attention.<//Review>

In the few times I have used Summit Urgent Care the past 5 years, I was seen promptly and received the level of care expected for an Urgent Care facility.  In a recent visit, Carlos, a nurse (I think; not sure of his title), went above and beyond in his job to ensure I got the prescription I needed.  My insurance didn’t cover it at first, and he worked promptly and diligently with all necessary parties - between pharmacy, doctor, and insurance company - to reclassify the need, so I ended up only paying the copay for the prescription.  Overall, he was on the ball, 5 star service.  As one would hope, he took charge and did what I as the patient couldn’t have done for myself, making it easy on me.  For him in particular, I am grateful.  He is a gem amongst the staff there.  Thank you!< /review>

<Review>I don't understand mediocre reviews. I went to this everyone was friendly and caring. I had problems with my insurance and had to pay cash so they called all the radiologists in town for one that would give a cause discount saving me $400. They did local labs which are cheeper as well and the blood draw was absolutely painless. Being away from my home as long as I am in Palmdale I will use this place for my medical needs.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

Two hour wait, the P.A. came in for less than 40 seconds.  She obviously did not want to be there and was not concerned with providing a decent service; impersonable and lack of professionalism.
As much as we pay, you think a little respect and appreciation would be afforded.<//text>

Called to verify their hours and the gentleman told me patients would be seen as long as they arrived before 7pm. Brought my 10 year old son right over and arrived at 6:35. When the gentleman Saw it was a pediatric patient he sent us to the ER, not because he was worried for his well-being but for fear it would take longer than he'd like. My son's well being was not a priority at all. Very disappointed in the way we were treated and shuffled aside without even an assessment.<//text>

<Review>Came to this place with my 2 kids at 7pm (they close at 8). I came to this urgent care, because our assign urgent care in in Mission Hills. The place was closed, when A nurse there came out, I asked her why they were close when it state on there time schedule they close at 8pm. She said that they had reached there limit of seeing patient and couldn’t take anymore patient. Apparently when that happens they close early. I think that the most ridiculous thing I’ve heard. I’ve never heard of such a thing. It’s an urgent Care facility, how do you just number your patients. I hope hospital don’t start this rule.<//Review>< Pics>

< Review>
I have been here many times for myself (I have Lupus and get sick very easily and I have horrible flare ups) as well as my two young daughters. I always liked the facility, the Drs and NPs. They used to have bad customer service (mainly just the front desk woman who I was told was let go) but the last visit I went I actually met all new people and it was the best experience at an Urgent Care I have ever had! The staff was beyond friendly, it wa super fast, they took great care of my 2yr old and diagnosis was spot on! I highly recommend if you need after hours care or if your Dr office is a bit of a drive (like ours). I highly recommend them for quality, quick, and easy health care for smaller emergencies!<//Review>

Hand down, the BEST urgent care.  Staff and Dr's are amazing.  I've taken my infant son there, and I have seen the dr's myself.  Wish they had a private practice...the co-pays on Urgent Care are too expensive to go all the time...otherwise, I would!</Text>

My kids needed a followup and they behaved long enough until they had to wait for over half an hour for nobody to help and started to cry. The other patients started laughing at how loud they were and it got me pissed. There was a room they could use but they said they had to clean it up first. More than a half hour later it still wasn't ready. Nobody cared except for the people who weren't doctors. Unacceptable. Even their administrative manager said they couldn't set up an appointment because it has to be a physical in order to do one. She knew my situation and still couldn't help me.

MOST HORRIBLE PLACE EVER!!!

EXCEPT for the people who were not doctors or admin manager.< /Text>

<Text>My wife and I had severe bronchitis and could not see our regular doctor for a week and he referred us to Summit Urgent Care. We went there and saw only a nurse practitioner and received only temporary relief with no real help at all. 6 months later we finally get billed $348.66 each for the office visit alone and now a total bill for $924 even after insurance. There were no pricing lists when we arrived at Summit either, I would have walked out had I known their real prices . I checked with other urgent care offices in the area and found that they only charge $90 an office visit and you get to see a real doctor. If you like paying 400% more than the other places and get no relief, this is the place to go. I will never go there again!< /Text>< UserId.>

I've been there several times with my sick niece and/or nephew with their mother, and it's been great.  It's clean, everyone is nice, and professional.  However I have tried going now 2 days in a row, in the evening.  Last night, I got there at 7:30 and it was closed.  I was frustrated, but figured maybe they didn't take patients after 7:30 since they close at 8:00.  I began to feel horrible again today, and went in a little earlier, and arrived at 7:15....just as a man was hanging a sign in the door saying "Due to a high volume of patients..." they weren't taking any more at this time.  The waiting room was empty.

If you aren't receiving patients until 8 pm, you need to CLARIFY that on your website.  It was extremely frustrating for me to drive there, and I certainly don't want or need to sit in an ER.<//review>

<text>My daughter took her son to an urgent care in lancaster.  I was with her for moral support.  We were put into a room and waited for one hour and 15 minutes.  Finally we just walked out and went to Summit.  We were seen almost immediately.  My grandson was severely dehydrated and going out and in of consciousness.  Jeff at Summit hooked him up to an IV and Dx'd him, gave him a Rx and sent us on our way.  My grandson made a quick recovery.

<date>1521479791559< /date><Rating>1</Rating><text>This has got to be the worst urgent care I have ever had an experience with. I’m going to just be factual and refrain from bad language to keep my credibility. 3 days ago I came here because my insurance told me this place accepted my plan. When I got there they told me they were a private clinic and they only accept PPO plans and because I was HMO they couldn’t see me. I asked to speak with a manager to see if they could double check.im not sure if it was a manager but they told me the same thing. I decided to wait out my ankle injury and see if it got better but it began to bruise so I wanted to go to an urgent care to make sure it wasn’t broken just sprained. I called my insurance got a reference # and they told me to go back to summit and they would talk to them if there was a misunderstanding. Their hours are from 8am-8pm everyday and I got here at 9am and they weren’t open. A redhead was blocking the door and was quick to greet me but didn’t seem friendly just seemed like she was trying to catch me before I complained. She said they didn’t have a key so I had to wait until 10am when someone from their staff would bring a key. Finally someone brought the key and it was exactly at 10. When I got in I waited 15 minutes just to have them tell me they couldn’t see me. I asked again to speak to a manager and gave them a reference number. This time they said ok we can see you but then the same red head told me that their X-ray machine was down so they still couldn’t help me. It was an entire 1hr and a half wasted of my morning. I will never come back here and will just wait until April 1st when high desert will accept and enroll me.</text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

Prescribed medication for my son's swimmers ear and the medication was not penetrating his ear because of too much water in his ear so they told me I would have to come back and pay again to see the doctor. I am a cash patient so that gets costly!< /text>

<Text>Very rude staff, act as if they are doing someone a favor, when they should be providing courteous health care.

My wife was traveling all day (DC to LAX) and needed medical attention. She called ahead and upon arrival 2 hours before their posted closing time, they had a sign on the door saying they weren't taking anymore patients/customers.

My wife went in and asked the receptionist and this was due to "We had a rough day and we're going to close early"

After my wife left upset, she called me and told me. So I called and spoke to a ray of sunshine at the front desk and she proceeded to tell me the same message. I decided to lecture a bit and let her know that they are Health Care Providers and you signed up and went to school to help people in need and not turn people away. She hung up on me..... I called back and asked why she hung up and she told me that I wasn't listening.

She said that the "Provider" decided to close down early.

This type of service is why myself and many others in the AV don't goto these corporate clinics and drive down to LA or Burbank to seek healthcare by doctors who own their practices and value their reputation and customers.

Obviously they don't care.....but none the less, this Urgent Care lost My Family and I's business along with our Healthcare Insurance payments.

Hopefully the Board reads the reviews of the people you're supposed to serve.</Text>< pics>

when I took my 4 year old to Summit urgent care back in march, my experience was the best since I got there,  I did not have to wait for too long they were all really nice, receptionist, medical assistant, doctor, etc. my son had a really bad cough and they prescribed him with some medicine and just the way the doctor explained things to me was amazing, I was very happy, until last Saturday when I had to take my son again, he had fever and was coughing non stop I live an hour away from where his doctor is at and they don't work Saturdays, the lady at the front desk said I'm sorry but we cant see him because his insurance is not in our network, but funny thing is, its the same one he had back in march and had no problem. She said take him to the ER because we don't accept HMO only PPO, and I've been trying to look were in all the paper work and website says that???  for my fisrt time there Ill give 5 stars not for this last one.</text>

I have been here a few times and it has been a great experience until the most recent visit. I was in on Saturday morning. I have a cough that is so bad I havn't slept for more than a few minutes for 5 days. I am in agony. The woman checked my ear and kept pressing so hard it hurt. Its Sunday night and my ear, now, hurts so much! I don't know what she did!! She gave me 100 mg tesslon pearles that do absolutely nothing for my horrible cough. I am a veteran, still taking meds for breast cancer (I guess she didn't read my med history either) & I feel like I didn't get good care. Such a shame. The other times I have been here have been more than I expected; really great service. But now I don't want to go back. I have to go all the was to the VA to have my ear checked and the correct meds ordered :(< /Text>

I can hear you talking about me doc. You expressed verbally with much anger and frustration your dislike in helping me and referring me to the ER, but do I need to hear that. If you dont want your patients to hear how much you dont CARE at least put up some doors.  Should be called SUMMIT PALMDALE, bc their far from urgent and obviously dont care.

Omg I could not be more grateful. My kids leave on a flight to Europe tomorrow and their results would t have been available at their other testing place which we went to. I literally just showed up at Summit and they allowed us in to get rapid testing with results back within one hour. They literally saved me a $6k loss on the trip. I am eternally grateful.< /text>

Recently went to them for  a break job on my Mini. They completed the work by 5pm the same day. They live-up to all of the reviews on yelp. So I'll keep it short and simple. They are no-nonsense, honest, reliable and it's a no pressure kind of place.  They are also fairly affordable. They do thorough and efficient work and will highlight mechanical issues that are related to safety. I'll definitely bring my mini back in a couple of weeks to have other work done that they discovered.<//review>

He was really sweet I had a rough day with my car and he was able to fix it pretty quick. I thought it was my starter turned out I just needed a new battery. He seemed busy but I was happy he was able to pop a new one in and at a cheap price. I’ll be coming back for any future issues! Very random but he seemed really nice to his employees too!< /review>

Brought my car in to be smog inspected for AZ to CA registration. Mario was helpful, knowledgeable, efficient, and fast. I was in and out in 15min. He understood that my car came standard with a factory installed CAI. No EO # is required. Absolutely recommend.< /text>

<pics>None<//pics><review>Honest, amicable man. I came in for a brake inspection and possible brake pad replacement(s). The man, who I am assuming is Young, took a quick drive with the car and a quick inspection of the brakes and told me both how much brake pad I had left as well as the fact that I could probably go another 5,000 miles or so before requiring a brake pad replacement. He was also kind enough to suggest that the next time I get an oil change, I should ask them how much brake pad I have left to gauge the situation.

The quote he gave me over the phone was also super reasonable when compared to the other places I was browsing through.

I would definitely want to bring my car here when I do need to replace my brake pads!</review>< rating>

<review>I came in for an inspection of a 2010 Ford Mustang because there’s some squeaking on the right rear that I thought was due to a bent axel. A mechanic named Rony said there is no axel (??) and that the squeaking was just a minor issue caused by a hook (tow hook?) being crooked from when the muffler was changed by the previous owner.
He said he adjusted the hook, which I didn’t ask for, and the car was fine to drive and to just come back if the squeaking is the same or worse. I took it for a second opinion and the shop confirmed that the right rear axel is bent. Despite me naming the issue upon arrival, the shop wasn’t able to help identify the issue. Do not recommend.</review><user>117259315000443512664< /user><GmapID>0x80c2b87a43190119:0x824007fb2bb37829</GmapID></record>

<Review>Found this place for my moms Toyota 4Runner. I love that they are an honest company that do great work. Dealerships are always so expensive, so I love that Affordable Care is just that...they are truly affordable and know what they are doing.  I forget the gentleman that runs the shop, but he even recommended a place down the street to fix something that he didn't repair who also did good work. Very nice.<//Review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

I guarantee this place is one of the best auto shops in the LA. The owner has shown honest and trustworthy gesture toward every customer who visits this shop. I strongly recommend visiting and experiencing this place for car repairs and maintenance even if you are not in this town.</review>

The owner of this shop is not only one of the best mechanics around, and will make sure they can help you take care of your car problem, he is one of the nicest people around. He will take care of you and even treat you like family. Great service all around!< /Text>

아는분께 소개받고 영스오토만 가는데 확실히 정직하시고 가격도 좋고 믿고 맡길수 있어서 좋았습니다. 이년내내 여기만가는데 여기만큼 싸고 좋은곳은 없는것 같아요. 추천 합니다<//text>

<text>Ordered the Champa Sampler (rice ball salad was the best but everything was SO FLAVORFUL and good!), Kaow Poont - Lao's Vermicelli (coconut soup was great and wasn't spicy at all), and Pad Kea Mow - Drunken Noodles (much better than I expected and has a sweeter flavor than I've ever had). Food was a great mix of flavors and textures, and I would definitely order from here again!<//text>< resp>

<Review>I was ecstatic to find out I could door dash lao food since lao restaurants are a rare find in L.A. I've only had their lao sausages, sticky rice and papaya salad. Delicious.  Although the 2nd time I ordered,  they wrap the papaya salad in foil and pack it in a box with noodles and cabbage. I found a long brownish blonde hair in my papaya salad box with the noodles and cabbage. A bit of a turn off but I'm not gonna lie, I'll still order from Champa again.< /Review>< pictures>

<Text>Ordered vegan pad kee mao, and it was good! Nice service!

Pro-tip: If you like it spicy, tell them... Because I thought it was not as spicy as I expected and made it work with the chili oil.<//Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNyzUZk-03hdOQAy5nW3atmxfdIr49xUxMdmMqP=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP4RIknSFLP0--KIDQg_AdOH7cgKM-yIadLtJRn=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures>< Resp>

<Text>I came for a late lunch here. I arrived about 1:30 in the place was pretty empty. I was advised to take any seat that I wanted. Since I was eating by myself I only got the Champa sampler plate which gives you threedifferent appetizer items. It was actually too much food just for myself. So I am glad I didn't order a main dish. Service was sparse as, I was only spoked up once for water refill. soon enough there was a few more tables that popped up. People actually had to go to the counter to go get the tray of condiments for their food. I wouldn't try to park on the main street, which is ocean avenue, I would park in the residential area. But I would warn against leaving any valuables in sight as car break-ins have been moving into the residential neighborhoods of San Francisco. I would say definitely come with friends so you could get more items to share. I'm so glad that I found out they had this location in San Francisco because I've only been to the one in Oakland.<//Text>< rating>

Tom Kha and "house special" ( catfish with eggplant and sprigs of fresh peppercorns) excellent. Laotian version of green papaya salad not for the faint of heart. Good service.<//Text>

I feel like management hires a bunch of young people who simply don't care about the image of the restaurant. During my last visit one of the waiters friends sitting at the bar delivered my food to the table and found it to be the strangest thing i've seen before. After the food was brought you can hear them laughing about it behind the counter. The wait staff at this location really needs some training or need to be replaced.

<time>1566307305870< /time><Pics>None< /Pics><Review>I've eaten here only twice, but both experiences I've been blown away by the quality and spice level of the food. I've tried the champa sampler, Lao sausages, pad Thai, Thai style papaya salad, and drunken noodles. My favorites hands down are the papaya salad (do not order more than level 1 if you can't handle heat!!! You have been forewarned) and the drunken noodles, although the Champa sampler is a close third. I thought their pad Thai was mediocre compared to the other dishes. Excellent food for a decent price.< /Review></record>

We ordered dinner home that was absolutely delicious. We got the beef salad, Pad Thai pork, Warp beef Thai, Pad Gra Pow, and Brown rice. The combination was great!! And 2 big hungry men and small lady like me enjoyed all of it:)).</text>

<review>Big, clean, open, and delicious! Peanut stir fry "special" was FABULOUS! (Sliced beef with it was very very thin and good.) Fried tofu was your typical fried tofu -- tasty -- and the green sauce they bring with it was quite yummy. The tom kha soup had chunks of coconut in it! Superb. Good hot tea not on menu, but they bring it upon request.< /review><username>Renata Martin</username><rate>5<//rate>< user>

The Champa sampler is a great dish in this popular and trendy restaurant. Expect 25-35 age range and solid Thai dishes.<//Text>

<text>I had been here before and at the time it was near closing time and there was a waiting list for the table. The foods was good. Wish I had more time to enjoy the foods here. I agreed with other reviewers that most of the servers there aren’t friendly or nice. They’re young people and strictly there for the business. It’s hard to get their attention, “why bothered” is kind of attitudes.</text>< pics>

Delicious Thai cuisine in small restaurant with modern decor with a few traditional decorations.  Great place for lunch or dinner.  I love, LOVE, the Tom Kha soup.  It's very tangy and tasty with lemongrass and coconut.  The yellow curry, pad Thai noodles, and satay skewers are also good.  Really, everything is delicious.  You can't go wrong.  It's my family's favorite neighborhood restaurant.</Text>

<Text>My roommate took yesterday for the first time and I thoroughly enjoyed the food! We went at 6pm because he said it gets very busy, and I'm so glad we did. It's a small-ish place with majority of the tables that sit 4 people. It has a nice atmosphere and the staff seem very nice.
I'm a vegetarian so I ordered the tofu fried spring roll and Red curry with tofu. Both dishes were delicious. Was slightly disappointed that the spring roll came with a sauce that contained fish sauce. They should consider another alternative. The prices for the starters were also pretty expensive; the same as main dishes which kind of sucks.
The curry was good as expected. We also got the fried banana with coconut ice cream for dessert which was mouth watering!!

In all good first time visit!
TL;DR Good food, nice atmosphere and staff, gets very busy, pricy starters, amazing dessert<//Text></record></dataset><record>

I don't know if it was an off night for them, whether they were understaffed , and had an influx of take out orders. I did notice that people who were done eating and and paying, were just hanging out for extremely long, which made others who were waiting for a table crowd up, again making it harder. To sum up. A couple of factors could have not been in there favor. Regardless, I won't be returning anytime soon.</Text></record></dataset><record>

My girlfriend, friends, and I have been frequenting the original Oakland location for nearly half a decade, so we were excited to learn that they had a new location in SF, where we live. For the record, I have rated the Oakland location with 5 stars and have recommended it to many people. Unfortunately, this location does not satisfy and live up to the Champa Garden name.

The original location has the best Pad Thai, hands down. I brought a group of friends who have never had Champa Garden to this location and enthusiastically recommended the Pad Thai; unfortunately, all of them stated it was the absolute worst Pad Thai they have ever had. The overpowering taste of ketchup was the only flavor in this dish. (By the way, authentic Pad Thai does not contain ketchup, but I am generally fine with ketchup in this dish because most American Thai restaurants cook it that way).

The basil fried rice was lacking, as well, which was disappointing because the Oakland location's version is one of my favorite fried rice dishes. Other dishes we tried were uninspired and did not warrant another order. The only saving grace is the rice ball salad, which my friends stated they would probably place pick-up orders for in the future. At least this popular appetizer is as good at this restaurant.

Additionally, the service was very poor. We had to ask for water refills a few times, and it took at least 10 minutes just to get each refill. Our appetizers came promptly, but there was at least a 15-minute wait between finishing our appetizers and the entrees' arrival.

I initially planned to rate this restaurant with 2 stars because it was disheartening to have this location be that much worse than the original. However, I took a step back and thought a 3-star rating would make more sense: it may not be anywhere close to the original restaurant, but it is still better than some Thai restaurants in SF and does not fully deserve a 2-star rating. I hope to return to this restaurant in the future; perhaps by then, they will have worked out all their kinks.</text>

The BBQ chicken was chicken breast and over cooked and dry, but otherwise the Pad Kee Mao is usually a hint spicy, but when I asked them to make it one notch spicier, they delivered!  One other knock is that rice is separate.<//Text>

Pad See Ew: Decent flavor.
Yellow Curry: Decent flavor.

The food here is okay. A modern decor Thai Restaurant that makes food quick. The yellow curry didn't have a lot of spice that I was expecting. The Pad See Ew had decently flavor and the vegetables were in big chunks.< /Text>

<Text>Food is good so after nit coming herd fir a long time because last time we were here they were short staffed. However, they still need more servers &  someone to bus dishes & set up for customers.. Our food was served cold because the servers were busy cleaning tables, removing dirty dishes , setting up & seating incoming customers. Due to lack of sufficient staff, they reused the same the rag they cleaned tables with many times, without disinfecting it & thus crosscontaminating & also stinking everything up. We had to get paper towels from rest room & reclean the table to get it to stop stinking & hopefully not run the risk of getting sick or & ruining our meal. If we had not been so hungry after waiting 45 min to be seated we would have left. Health department needs to get in here! I know I won't be back, too bad, it's so convenient to for me to come here.</Text>< Rate>

First time to try Lao's style Pho: soup was thicker than vietnamese style, and too salty for me. Wish they provide mung beans and onions on top. Crispy pork belly with Chinese broccoli was awesome!  (it was salty too)</Review>

Champa Garden is a wonderful addition to the neighborhood! They serve Laotian cuisine and everything we ordered was uber tasty!

We ordered the Champa Sampler which included a rice ball salad, lao sausage made with lemongrass, and fried spring rolls. The rice ball salad was my favorite from the sampler because it had a little spicy kick to it; loved all the different ingredients such as mint, cilantro, and peanuts which helped provide a nice refreshing bite when everything was combined together.

Lue's Noodle Soup (Kaow Soy) listed that it had fermented bean in it, which didn't initially appeal to me but I'm glad we decided to give it a try! It came with wide rice noodles and minced pork and the fermented bean taste was really faint. It looks spicy but isn't - great flavors and the dish was large enough to share.

The Duck Curry is also worth ordering if you are craving curry. The sauce was not watery nor too milky and they are generous with their chunks of duck meat, eggplants, and peppers! Rice is not included but this is definitely one of the better curries I've had in a really long time.

Overall I'd recommend coming here if you are seeking some flavorful Southeast Asian food with great service! The waitresses were attentive and the food came out quick, I'll be back soon!< /Review>

<review>As a fan of the Oakland location, I was excited to hear they expanded across the bay after I made my move back to the City.

I come here strictly for the Laotian specialties so I cannot comment on the Thai food. The rice ball salad is a delicious blend of crunchy fried rice, bits of tasty sausage, and fresh herbs. It is only second to Vientiane in Oakland. The Lao sausage is also a flavor bomb. And if you like your papaya salad funky and spicy, Champa's Lao version will not disappoint.

While many are a fan of Lue's noodle soup, I favor the soothing Lao version of chicken noodle soup, kao piak. This is made with thick (udon girth), fresh rice noodles that impart an excellent chew, and comes with a hefty amount of chicken and the right sprinkling of fried shallot and green onion.

I have seen waits to be seated here since the space is smallish and they don't jam too many tables in. However, they pack their to-go noodle soups well, by separating out the noodles from the broth and accompaniments. Service is fair and the space is noticeably clean and benefits in ambiance from the large windows facing the street.

Parking can be tight on Ocean, but can be found nearby on residential streets. All in all, I give an edge to their Oakland location for portions and consistency but that is almost entirely compensated for this location being on my current side of the Bay.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

Friendly and near the harbor. Great for oyster lovers. In fact you can take a tour and harvest your own oysters. Stayed in the hotel (Airbnb) in the same building. What a great spot for a vacation. Had local beers and ciders with a charcuterie board.</text>

Ordered two ciders and 6 raw / 6 grilled oysters as a pre-dinner hangout. Everything was great and the atmosphere is perfect.</review>

<Text>A mix of local goods for sale, to take home or gift, plus an oyster bar with drinks. Quality Humboldt products of all kinds are offered. Under normal circumstances (before the pandemic) it provided a place to have a quiet drink and perhaps play a board game. So quiet though. So quiet. I bet it's a very safe place to be during social distancing times.</Text>< gmap_id>

<text>Wonderfully delectable chartucerie plates and oysters farmed by the owner, Sebastian.  The food and drinks are locally sourced!  The oysters are medium sized, not overly briny or have sediment in them as with other places.  We both loved them with the summer mignonette, which is reminiscent of a cool and refreshing summer drink.  We had the smoked salmon and the Cypress Grove cheese platters.  The Wycliff Brut paired well with the food.  The setting is in a beautifully restored building with reclaimed, varnished wood tables, subtle modern touches and outdoor seating available with heat lamps.  Sebastian was a wonderful host/server and very attentive.<//text><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmap_id>

Only serve the Bucksport oysters(briny with a melon finish), otherwise this is a top notch oyster bar. Good beers and wine and friendly staff.</review>

What a wonderful experience! Oysters are so fresh, cheese plates are fantastic and delicious, atmosphere is lovely, and Captain Sebastian and his staff are so welcoming! My husband and I haven’t been out to eat in almost a year, due to COVID restrictions, but the safety of both the staff and customers are evident here and we felt comfortable. Thank you!< /text>

It's good for oysters and beer. Understaffed and gruff service, expect long delays to get your food (30-40 mins), so wouldn't go if you have plans later</Review>

A great place to gather with family and friends, to have drinks and yummy bites. Definitely a Humboldt must.</text>

We wanted to give our kids their first experience eating Oysters, and decided to try this place on our recent mini vacation to the Redwoods.  As with most Oyster dishes the pricing was on the high side but we enjoyed our time there.  If you have the budget you can treat your stop there as an appetizer venue before going somewhere else.</review>

Delicious oysters, raw or broiled. Their menu is full of flavor! From the bread and butter to the cheese platter you’ll enjoy a variety of bold flavors that partner really well with your choice of beer or wine. Knowledgeable staff to help you choose a new favorite drink! Can’t wait to return.</review>

So excited that I stumbled into this place! What a wonderful treat! my only problem was I misunderstood the menu and I ordered the wrong cheese. I should have had the goat cheese rather than the cow cheese which was basically a bunch of bland cheese.<//Text>

Looks like a nice place. My wife and I arrived about 7:30 pm for dinner. We walked in and were the only customers there. There were 3 staff there we were given a menu and that person walked away after a few minutes no one returned to check on us or to bring us water. We left shortly thereafter. No sure what happened.<//text>

<Text>Arrived from out of town and made it here about half an hour before close on a Sunday night. Looked quiet, but people were still being served, so we walked in and stood at the bar for a few minutes. No acknowledgment from staff. Grabbed a couple of menus and sat to look em over. Couple more minutes. Still no acknowledgment from staff. We left. Doubt they even noticed.
I'd read good things about the food and the service, unfortunately didn't experience any of it.</Text>< userid>

We shared the smoked salmon platter and the sausage platter..... Both had super yummy goat cheese and fermented green beans. Not exactly a meal, but absolutely perfect with a couple of beers! If you're an oyster fan, this is definitely the place to go!< /Review>

<review>The atmosphere is great. Also, the staff are friendly.

Drink prices are a bit higher, but reasonable. The food is good, but it's pricey. It would be nice if the portions were increased or a few dollars were knocked off the prices. Might bring in more people too.

We ordered the cheese sampler and it came with 4 good-sized samples of cheese. Unfortunately, there were only a few tiny bread pieces. We asked for more bread and it was brought out (not sure if we were charged for it), although it still wasn't enough. The amount of bread just did not seem realistic to me.

We'll definitely go back, but if the prices were lower we'd go much more often.< /review><username>Jessica Heiden<//username>< Rating>

Leaving Humboldt county was the hardest thing because of this glorious restaurant.
I highly recommend the Diablo. The flavors strike your mouth with the salt from the oyster then softly the sweetness hits a calm sweet pepper.... Grab your drink quick! There is a little kick in the end 😁
Definitely head down to the Bay when here to check out the social club and shuck the guys yourself !< /Text><rating>5< /rating></record>

<Text>Not a chamber of commerce!  Awesome older building that serves local beer, wine, and DELICIOUS Humboldt Bay oysters.  Just recently added outdoor seating; great for people watching.  You can also arrange tours for the surrounding area to include going out and getting your own oysters.  Highly recommend.< /Text>< pics>

<text>The "buck a shuck" happy hour oysters (from 6-8) are definitely worth the price.  Most everything else seems a bit overpriced, even for coastal California.  Service was good.

Love this little place. Love the decor and bar.  I've had the raw kumamoto oysters, cooked kumamoto  oysters, with every topping and the cheese plates (Cypress).  Enjoyed most of the toppings, but loved the butter/garlic/hot sauce/lemon topping most of all.</review>

Humboldt Bay provisions is an awesome place to go try out Humboldt Bay oysters the staff know how to pair drinks and other sides excellently. What's even better is the fact that they have the option to cook your oysters because personally...I cannot stand trying to swallow a raw cold one🤢. The broiled oysters are amazing especially with one of the many sauces they have that complement the cooked morsel. One last thing you MUST CHECK OUT is buck a shuck Tuesdays if you love oysters like I do go chuck a few bucks at El Capitano sebastion and tell him Luis(aka. The big guy with the dreadlocks) sent you, oh and I believe buck a shuck tues deal is only from the hours of 6pm to 8pm.  Just make sure you don't over do it or you may chuck your cookies lol< /Text>

Humboldt Bay Oyster Tour Terrific!

Humboldt Bay (and the Arcata Bay portion in particular) is home to some of the world's best oysters - and oyster farmers!  The Oyster Tour is a terrific way to learn about how oysters are grown - a surprisingly hands-on process.

I'd say we are in the early stages of what may be called "the craft oyster movement" (like the craft beer movement of the 1980's and 1990's).  Oyster farmers are experimenting with a range of variables to explore the resulting shapes, growth rates, and tastes.  It appears that location has a great deal of impact, for example, and oyster beds just a few hundred meters away from one another may yield surprisingly different oysters - this is now known as "merroir".

Sebastian is both the tour guide and one of these local farmers.  Full of facts and surprising anecdotes about oysters, oyster farming, clam farming (yes, the Bay producers millions of baby clams that are then raised elsewhere) and the Bay itself.

You'll see oysters that are just a few weeks old, to those ready to be harvested, to some approaching 30 cm in length (OK, a foot long) - and you'll choose a few to sample when you return ashore.

If you like oysters and have a desire to learn a bit more about them first-hand, this tour is highly recommended.

Bring waterproof boots (the higher the better), as you'll hop out of the boat at the farm to explore the beds.  Bring several layers of clothing - and sunscreen, depending on the weather.<//Text>

Were you greeted by a team member shortly after entering? Did they offer a narrative of the current situation? Did drinks and platters take long based on current occupancy? Were 2 or 3 team members present? Was the order of food or drink ordered not prepared correctly, not available, or off flavor/texture? We want to do better. Thank You. Sorry for extremely late reply.'}<//Resp>< name>

<text>Took forever to make a pizza even with one customer ahead of me. I don't know how they manage to handle the lunch crowd here. The sauce here is nothing special and the pizza kind of falls apart on the crust if there are too many toppings. They charged $2 extra for thick crust even though the extra charge was not posted or mentioned. Essentially the thick crust is just two dough smashed together. Also ordered the herb butter strip. Looked nice and buttery while they were making it but after it came out of the oven it was anything but that. The appetizer felt over baked and lacked any visible herb and butter. Was essentially dry pizza dough with a hint of herbs and butter. Skip.</text><Rate>2<//Rate><Resp>None<//Resp>< user_name>

<date>1512791399715</date><Rating>3</Rating><review>This place used to be an amazing place, I haven't been back in 6 months and now the prices went up, the salads are half of what they used to be and almost look like they were half eaten. Before they were packed into the containers and looked picture quality. There used to be 3 different types and not there is only one. The pizza itself is quite good but not worth the price anymore (only reason why I gave it that 3rd star). The drink options were minimal and 3 out of 4 dispensers were empty which was very disappointing. Probably wont coming back, and it is really sad because I used to love this place.< /review>< Pics>

<Review>Loved the pizza, second visit was not so great. Workers took a very long time. During your lunch hour, you don't want to spend 45 min standing in line. Just went back this weekend with the kids and turns out, this location is now closed.<//Review><time>1520375594449<//time></record>

Honestly, it's just good. Maybe I put too many toppings on, or should have tried one of their recommended pizzas, but this is nothing to text my Mom about it.< /review>

burnt my pizza and another couples order as well(they requested to have it remade). Also the crust is alittle too much on the thin side that it's like cardboard. I might try again but maybe not this one.< /Text>

Gas stations now and days don't offer garbage cans or anything to wash your windows! I guess it's all cuz of the coronavirus! ☹️<//Text>

LOL reviewing a gas station. I hit this one on the way home because the price per gallon is usually lower than most in Terra Linda.  Lottery tickets, food, drinks sold here, too.<//text>

<Text>Square Pie guys Oakland opened yesterday. I've never tried a Detroit style pizza before and it rocks! Texture is fluffy and crunchy. I got the Big Von which is pepperoni,  garlic cream sauce and honey hot which gives it a sweetness and sausage. The flavors are very good. As this was my first time trying a new style, I wasn't use to there being so little meat compared to the crust so that takes some getting use to. Chef was having a meeting with the entire staff and there was very good energy.  Welcome to Oakland SPG!</Text><name>Donna Fong<//name>< gmap_id>

Ordered online, picked up in the store. Super nice employees.  There are two lines, one for online orders, another for placing orders.
We ordered their pepperoni, and cheesy bread. Both were fantastic. Much more flavorful than your normal Detroit style pizza.  Highly recommended.<//Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNzXMh64wRKmuG34DFAKogXuNau2DaYkaKdM135=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOsfpb0HEMhLyVCCQBP0656gN5wHl003Cbx3Xl5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO8-EJWqXYjd41trv2qfXIycLSYqapviBY575qM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures>< resp>

<text>SO HAPPY SPG is here in Oakland! Even though you can't see with the face masks- that everyone wears properly- you can tell the staff is smiling and happy to be there.

I think the manager's name was Yahairra? She was helped moves things along with all the orders smoothly and efficiently.

We will be back for sure.< /text><Rating>5< /Rating><user_id>118117807601332534642< /user_id><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNfKpeFbEuze1ScASzFyxFa1gHY1RhMoQok3gOd=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNxFk9VmH92EIJMdAXRwwp2GbpYd23J-GimVfCo=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics><Date>1618360599398< /Date></record>

Well, I’m here to tell you when someone asks if you want to go to Square Pie Guys to get some food, your answer should be “yes, now please”. The crust/dough looks thick but it’s fluffy and not doughy at all. The red sauce adds to the pizza but doesn’t take away from the cheese or toppings. And if you like the cooked slightly burnt cheese dripping edges on a grilled cheese or quesadilla, these pizzas have that on all the edges. Don’t worry, it’s not over powering, again, it only adds to the magic of the experience.

Get the monkey bread. You’re too full from all the other food? To bad, get the monkey bread. It’s perfect. And I will add it’s perfect the next morning with coffee.<//Review>

<text>I'm from Detroit so if I hear Detroit/Chicago style pizza I'm gonna be picky. The Pepperoni pizza is like a mix between Jetz & Buddy's (Local Detroit will know these two places)

Definitely the closest pizza place on the west coast I've had that does the Detroit/Chicago style justice.

The only suggestion that I have is that they need to be open to custom orders, but they're not. For example, I prefer the pepperoni under the cheese.

All in all, I wasn't expecting much but was VERY surprised as to how close they have achieved this special style of pizza.<//text>< name>

Square Pie Guys is great! I would highly recommend. The pizza is spectacular, the crust is fluffy and crunchy at the same time!!

The wings are great too, you can tell they put a lot of effort into their food.

The packaging is pretty cool too!<//text>

A unique pie, in a sea of round averages... They are not afraid to burn the edges, which I like but, you might not... Some of their combinations are unusual and according to their menu are unchangeable (think Soup N@zi) but, sometimes ya just gotta go with the flow and try something different... Ya never know you just might find something new you didn't know you liked! The pies are all 'thick crust' Sicilian style which you either like/love or ya don't... So know this going in... But, if you need to get your modern Sicilian on, get on down to the Guys With the Square Pies! Yum-a-rooski!</text>

This place is a game changer! I'd never had Detroit style pizza before and now I can't get enough of that cheese crust. Nothing beats a 6x8 with some Mike's Hot Honey but the Big Von and JLIN pies are also among my favorite pizzas of all time. They even offer vegan and gluten free versions which my family loves (they normally never agree to go to SF for pizza). Pretty stoked they're in Oakland now so I can order whenever</Review>

<Text>6/5 would recommend! The crust is unlike any pizza crust I've ever had and 6x8 physically could not hold more pepperonis—just the way it should be. Plus the space is epic. It's going to be such a killer happy hour spot with all their delicious cocktails.</Text>< Pics>

<Review>Love this pizza , always order and never have a issue getting my pie well done. I ask for it everytime I order and its fulfilled. When requesting today I was told by sales person that me asking for my pie to be welldone was a modification and would not be done. That they would have to cook it longer and as if it would completely throw off their operation. I understand no modifications but I am not asking for something to be added or removed and my request which is always fulfilled was something very minimal to appease a paying customer. None the less I love the pizza just disappointed in the service being made felt as if my order was a burden</Review><pics>None<//pics><response>{'time': 1619161197262, 'text': "Hello Allizm. Thanks for taking the time to share your experience today. We are so sorry that you felt this way, and we assure you that you are not a burden at all! We greatly appreciate you and your order.\n\nWould you email us over at Oakland@squarepieguys.com? I'd like to personally call you and try to better understand what happened. In full transparency our oven is set to cook all the pizzas for the same amount of time on a conveyor belt. I'm not trying to refute what you are saying but it's not our standard practice to put pizzas back on the belt. With that in mind it's important for us to try and understand your prior experiences at our shop.\n\nThanks again and we hope to hear from you soon.\n\n-Marc"}</response><gmapID>0x808f81a873193f03:0xed93c81b3fa38913<//gmapID></record>

The pizza is good. But it would be a lot better if it wasn't cold every time. The first time I was quoted 75 minutes. I showed up at 40 minutes and it was already cold.
The second time I was quoted 40 minutes and it was ready after 15. The third time it was ready at least 45 minutes before they told me (because I went early and it was already luke warm by then).</Text>

<Review>Nice and fluffy in the middle with a nice crispy outside.
For a thick pizza it was surprisingly light which was rad cuz I got to eat more of it.
Sauce and cheese was good too flavor wise.
I got the basic pie to test the waters, look forward to trying the other stuff out soon.
Skip ordering through the 3rd party apps theyre tacking on like an extra $5 a pie before even adding all their fees.</Review>< Rating>

< review>
I was here for opening day March 1st 12pm it was busy with about a 1 hour wait for online orders. I've been to the San Francisco location many times in 2019 and 2020. I've worked at Round Table Pizza as my first job and I have a thing for unique pizza. This by far takes my pick as best pizza ever for me. The pizza itself is strong, you can grab it and try to shake the toppings off unlike other pizza that falls apart. On opening day the pizza was on point just like the SF location. I will for sure come back!</review>

So glad they’re now in the East Bay! SPG’s food is excellent, and is always prepared with fresh, seasonal and innovative flavor combinations. The cheddar crust on their pies is always baked to perfection.< /Text>

<user_name>Nikolai Korhummelstone<//user_name><rating>1</rating><Text>Really slow service. They took on too many orders.... waited  an extra 45 minutes for a pickup order because they don't know how to expedite or manage orders. Pizza was good though. Similar to little Caesars. Sichuan chicken had no flavor and was extremely  dry inside. False advertising  with the chicken. Taste like dried out fried chicken from domino's... Calling it "Sichuan chicken" is an insult to chinese food. The one thing that I enjoyed was the brussel sprouts. But they should just call them "good brussels sprouts".. not Sichuan... This restaurant has a little too much hype imo... I would skip and order Little Star pizza which is 100% quality over square guys...<//Text></record></dataset><record>
< review>
I happened to walk by this new pizza place and had to try it. The pizza was tasty, but unfortunately the customer service was really bad. The prices are kinda steep for a small pizza.
I was told 15-20 minutes. Checked at 20 and it wasn’t ready. Ok. Checked at 35 minutes and it wasn’t ready. I was told 10 more. An hour later, still not ready, and the manager or owner came over and was extremely rude and said “Take your money back if you’re in a hurry”.

Bottom line: Don’t tell me 15-20 minutes if it’s going to be 1+ hour wait.< /review>

Been wanting to try this place for awhile so I was excited it finally opened in oaktown. Went around 2pm on a Wednesday afternoon- when you would typically expect it to be pretty dead. We ordered two pizzas to try- the big von and the spicy ellen. After waiting over 45 minutes we have to complain- the person who took our order didn't say anything about a long wait and there was only one other person who ordered after us and 6 people working. Never expected it to take that long given all the circumstances, we would've gone somewhere else! Pizza was good, we expected the big von to be a little spicy because of the hot honey. It was just sweet, but good. The spicy ellen was definitely spicy! It needed the honey. DO NOT buy the ranch- it tastes like the garbage you get at domino's, and they only offer it in a three pack for $2.50. Overall it was good but we would much rather go to any of the other amazing pizza options in the area. It's very pricy and the wait is just too long.</Review>

There were 3 rooms and 2 ladies up front just chatting with each other but only one room was being used by one male. My hour there could have been cut way down of they better managed their staff and their facility. But, it is a nice clean place.< /text>

Awesome service thank you very much I was impressed with the front desk she gave me everything I needed in minutes, and was so helpful and patience.
Your X-ray tech made me comfortable and was professional and caring.<//Review>

This was my first experience at this imaging facility and it couldn't have gone better! The technician made the x-rays so easy....so different from experiences at other places. She was very pleasant and efficient. Got my CD to take to the ortho doctor and was on my way! Very pleased with this Imaging Center.</Review>

<rate>5<//rate><Review>Great experience! I hurt my ankle and knew I needed X-rays and an evaluation. They were very nice and polite. I was a walk-in and did not have an appointment. Pretty quick once I checked in. Sent me to an X-ray facility just a few blocks away. Took me right in as soon as I returned with the images and got me a brace immediately. They even had different options of braces for me to try so I could use what felt the most comfortable to me. All of the staff was helpful, knowledgeable and a pleasure to deal with. I'm soooo glad I went to this urgent care facility. I will be glad to go back again if I need to.<//Review>< pictures>

<Text>Not a fan of their phone system. You can’t actually talk to a person. They also take a 1.5 hour lunch and that isn’t on their website. The location was very busy as the staff was visibly irritated. Not their fault, I’d be mad too if I was short staffed. Wasn’t a great experience but it was acceptable. Nothing bad happened besides the visible annoyance of the staff.<//Text><pics>None< /pics><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>

The person at the desk was extremely courteous and helpful.  He answered questions and helped with paperwork.  He deserves a big  thanks.

However, the xray technician was NOT.   He was rude and treated me like I just was wasting his time.  When I said I could not do squats, he implied that I just did not want to do them.  Not a good experience.  I came in for a knee xray.</text>

<Review>I asked a question and the tech responded:"don't worry about it the doctor will get the information and speak to you about it."
During my stay, he didn't put anything on me like they've done in the past to protect me from radiation. The guy at the front desk, wasn't to friendly either. Both gentlemen acted like I was an interruption of their day. Very sad!< /Review><time>1558120025339< /time></record>

<resp>None< /resp><Review>Wow! This place is a gem. Excellent service, great food, and nice ambience. It was my birthday and no one said anything to the staff but they noticed and brought me a beautiful green tea ice cream bowl with a candle at the end and wished me happy birthday. That is what I call outstanding customer service. The sushi was delicious, the beef teriyaki was so tender, and the presentation was beautiful. This place is so worth it. A true gem.< /Review><user_name>Antje Riley<//user_name>< GmapID>

Food was really good. Server had no personality. The other server that stopped by was very friendly. If it had a more inviting staff I would have given 5 stars.< /text>

I really love their sushi. prepared well and really tasty. Last night I had the Gogi chicken and it was tasty as well. The one thing preventing me from giving them 5 stars was the service. I usually get my shushi to go so not too much experience with the service before. they could up their game in that department a little bit<//text>

<Review>Gave a ton of food for a kids plate. Food was good. They are hiring for serving staff and it was noticeable that they needed help in service side. All around great experience and tasty sushi ! My husband likes that they have a great variety of sushi and other dishes< /Review>< Pics>

Have been going here since this place has opened. Tonight we walked out! The reason being, that we were told that they will no longer make any of our regular sushi iteams and put limits on what can be ordered (how does that work for an all you can eat) this is the ONLY reason we go to the Sushi & Gogi Palace. Prior to being told this. A party of 6 (regulars) walked out due to change. Unfortunately, they just lost business of 2 different parties of (weekly) regulars within 20 minutes. Something is fishy with this restaurant every week we come in there is NEVER the same sushi chef. Customer services and good food is what keeps people coming back, they are lacking customer service and in my opinion the last 3-4 times we have eaten here the sushi quality have gone down hill. Hate to say it but we will not be returning to this restaurant. Very disappointing.</review>

Love the sushi here and the employees are friendly. Only thing is that if you get all you can eat sushi make sure you only order what your going to eat because or else you have to pay for the extra sushi you didn't eat.<//Review>

<Review>I like the place. We had korean spicy tofu and seafood soup, bulgogi and some spicy pork. I didn't like the bulgogi that much but the rest of the food was good.

<text>My favorite sushi spot in town! I don't think i've tried anything I didn't like here. If you don't like sushi they have a really good teriyaki chicken or beef plate that is pretty huge! Everyone is usually nice but sometimes they're a little slow. I love the tempura here and their gyoza are cooked perfectly!

Edit 9/26/17: It's been 6 month since my original review and I'm going to have to say after my favorite sushi guy left this place just hasn't been the same. I might go back one day and give it another shot but for now i'd rather go to sugoi sushi.</text>< Pics>

A little on the expensive side, but you do get a good amount of food. Some items are a little bland, while others were outstanding.<//text>

<rating>3< /rating><Text>There ok i guess I sure miss the previous owners chili... their chili looks just like the previous owners but it doesn't  taste as good.  Not sure why I'm sure they bought the recipe along with the business. I just don't go that much anymore because of that reason.  Staff is not that friendly seems as though there to busy to show a little kindness towards the customers.  They still get allot of customers so people still like the chili they make now and like i said it's not bad it's just not as good as the previous owners.</Text>< Pictures>

<review>I haven't been to Chuck Wagon in a long time. Used to love it in my youth. The people there are very nice. However, to my disappointment, they don't serve their chili by the brick anymore, just cups. We ordered hamburgers, a chilidog, fries. The usual kind of stuff. I don't know if I got bigger or the food shrank, but the hamburgers seem small. A double burger with everything has pickles and lettuce and the patties and bun are the same size as Mcdonald's hamburgers.  That's why I'd don't go to McDonald's!! I'd like to see them step up their food.</review><username>Kenneth Ikemiya</username></record>

Excellent Local American Dining at it's best. Friendly, welcoming family atmosphere. Outdoor eating available. There sodas seem better than anywhere else. The chili is deliciously famous. Inexpensive. Popular place in town. No indoor seating but it goes with the experience.<//text>

If you're a chili fanatic, you need to try out this place!
Chili dogs, chili burgers, chili cheese fries, and all your favorite mom and pop style sides.
Outside dining only, but you're accompanied by the friendly local k9 welcome crew.
Make sure you cross this place of your bucket list!!!< /review>

<Review>Every year my family makes the trek from SoCal to vacation in Shaver Lake and every year I pass by the Chuck Wagon in Sager California wondering what magic resides in this walk-up food shack with the proclamation...Home of the "Chili Dog". This year my wife helped me with this bucket-list item by agreeing to stop at Chuck Wagon for lunch before heading into the Sierras. Was it a good "Chili Dog" you ask? Oh Yes, a very good chili dog...I would highly recommend it if you like Chili Dogs. But, if you do not like chili dogs this will not convert you.  The Chili Cheese Fries are also great, they put lettuce on top...I think that is the Chuck Wagon version of a salad. The star of the show is probably the Frito Pie my wife ordered. What is a Frito Pie you ask?...One small bag of Frito corn chips sliced open sideways, and then add chili, cheese, onions, and lettuce...served with a spork. Delicious!

I love that this place has existed for all these years and just keeps on going. It was obvious that it is popular with locals, not many tourists stopping in. Would I go back? You bet! That being said I don't think it will become a yearly tradition as my wife and daughter were not as thrilled with the Chuck Wagon as myself. But this place put a huge smile on my face and I will surely be back their again some day.</Review><UserId.>107912069581893217197</UserId.>< Response>

The food was amazing but we ordered a chili dog and it came in a paper bag? It was really messy and soggy and seeped through the bag. The cashier could of been a little more friendly too.< /text>

<review>The Chuck Wagon is a Sanger, CA institution.  As a long, long, long time Sanger resident I may be biased, but I do love this place.  If you have never been there before, it may seem intimidating but the staff is willing to answer questions.  The "Clark Burger" (no affiliation) is your standard double cheeseburger.  The chili is a meat (no beans) chili.  If you like good, greasy chili, then you will like this.  Much better (IMHO) than Tommy's in Southern California.  I know from which I speak on that point, as I went to school in SoCal and spent many a late night at Tommy's.

Fries are crinkle cut and always done to perfection.   I recommend using them to scoop up any chili that has fallen off of or out of your chili dog or Chili Clark.

Best bets? Most anything with chili on it - chili dog, chili cheese fries, chili Clark.  Note that chili cheese fries come with lettuce and onions on them.  I order without those items, but it is a matter of personal preference.

I will forever (or until such time as they get a new shake machine) miss having a chocolate milkshake with my chili dog.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><UserId.>117960634216369547783</UserId.></record></dataset><record>

Their ordering windows need a bit more organization so that you know who's ordering and who's picking up. Maybe use one for orders and one for pick up so that grumpy customers don't think you're crowding the line. Yes that happened lol, and we even asked if they were in line.

Very few times the chips had gotten soggy by the time I tried to eat it. I don't really mind because I keep returning for Frito pies.

Customers are nicer then employees. Charged me 32 dollars and was only supposed to be charged 18 wow nearly double the cost.  I aked why one order of chili fries were 3 something and three other one wad 14 something. Aslo charged me double cheese 4 times. When i asked the owner about pricing, the employee that over charged me lied and said i ordered 4 chili fries and three extra cheese on all. And the owner believed her not me.  Then i didn't hear them call our number,  waited till they finished with a costumer to see if they called our number. Owner ignored us looked past us and asked to help the next in line, the people behind us said she as Kim ed you guys a question maybe help her. It's sad when business act this way... horrible experience for the first time and for over seasoned chili with a slice of cheese melted on top not shredded and way too many onions.< /text>

Best chili cheese fries, hands down! You just walk up, place your order, wait to be called, get your food, and either walk around back to the picnic tables, or get to where you're gonna be real quick, so you can enjoy some awesomely bomb chili. My favorite item is the chili cheese dog. It's a foot long dog, covered in their chili & cheese. I get it with onions, but whatever. Lol Anyway, they have a cool menu, oh and delicious shakes as well! I HighLee recommend this local staple.</review>

<Review>Was driving through Sanger hungry, saw this little place with locals lined up ordering, so I figured there had to be a reason.  Stopped, ordered a burger and drink, got it pretty quickly and was decent.  Definitely not world class food, but it did hit the spot and I'm sure I'll stop by again should I be in the area.</Review></record>

<Review>It's a good place to get chili. I usually get the big cup of chili. Go home and make chili dogs n frito boats(frito pie) Either way it's an easy place to find and cheap. Menu is a lot smaller and they added some items. All In all I love it. I drive from fresno there.</Review>< Name>

< Review>
I've been living in Sanger for 20 Years and I must say this place is definitely a staple for this city. Throughout the years, prices have always remained constantly low. Now add the combination of Cheese and chili and you've got yourself a tasty and cost efficient meal.

If you're new to the place, great starter items are the Chili Cheese Fries and Chili Cheese dog.< /Review>

I've loved Chuck Wagon since I was a little girl, growing up in Sanger, CA. My family and I live in Fresno, but go to Sanger now & then to eat there as a treat, and stoll down memory lane. Yummy food there! Every Sanger native has to visit Chuck Wagon.</Review>

Anybody who goes to Sanger, you have to stop by Chuck Wagon! Home to the "Chili Dog". You won't regret it they are really good! And the Clark Burger too...Go check them out and buy a t-shirt and tell your friends and family....<//Text>

<Review>Best chili cheese fries in the world! Used to hit this place up for lunch weekly in the 80s and it hasn't changed. Burgers, hotdogs, fries and shakes are the bomb! Sanger's #1 destination location!<//Review>< username>

Passing through and saw the rating was good. Food was good but not outstanding. Had to wait for it to be prepared, but it was worth waiting for.  Would eat there again.</Text>

For the last 15 years I have been doing the extreme junk food binge here. If I am going to eat this kind of food, which is quite unhealthy; I'd rather take on the calorie debt here with this menu of comfort food delights. Quality and taste have varied only slightly since I first started going to Chuck Wagon.< /text>

Toward my dads last days he was able to eat hos footlong chili cheese  dog with everything on it. He has been gone for 4 years now. An ed we make it a point  to eat here at least once a month. So I do get sad when I eat here because  all the great moments we had.  Thank you chuck wagon keep up the great food.  The Alvarez family< /review>< Pics>

Normally I get exactly what I asked for but not this evening. I still love the food but I want what I want, when I take the time to drive 30 miles for it. So it may take me a while to make the trip again.</Text>

Honestly, the best chilli ever. I have never had any better. I would gladly go back here as often as possible once I get a car. If you haven't been here yet, go as soon as possible. You will NOT be disappointed.< /text>

<Review>Its OK. Everyone from Sanger always swears by it "the best place ever!!!!" My wife and her family are from Sanger and love love LOVE it. But I bust everyone's bubble...I work at a supermarket...and one day at work I was stocking an aisle. And I saw these people near the chili beans. And I overheard "now let's get the stuff for chuck wagon..." And I saw the lady and man grab every can of Hormel chili (no beans) off the shelf...and I was thinking..."I knew it!" Everyone loves the chili...but its straight up can chili...maybe they add an ingredient or 2 but it's just can chili...so there. Hope I didn't crush all of your dreams...< /Review>< Pics>

I got a Clark burger plain (just meat and cheese on a bun), wife got a chilli cheese dog with onions, and we split chilli cheese fries without onions. The chilli is sauce and ground beef without beans. The fries are the crinkle cut type.
I thought the chilli has a light taste reminiscent of the taco meat that you get from Taco Bell but the wife disagreed.
Overall the taste of the food isn't going to explode in your mouth. It's plain. The burger was lightly seasoned and I'd say the taste in the meat was mostly from the grill rather than seasoning. I think the key here is to get the chilli sauce on your hot dog or hamburger.  Even if you do get the chilli it's not aggressive, it's not going to make you think it's homemade and it's not going to win any chilli contest. It's also not likely to give you heartburn which is a plus.
Lastly, the chilli cheese fries came out less warm than you would expect. This could be due to the wait time. We went on a Saturday at about 630PM and there was a sizeable line and we waited about 15 minutes to get our order.</Review>

Chilli cheese fries and the Clark burger!  Epic! I've been eating here for more than thirty year when I come through town. Only down side is service they have the rudest people taking your orders.</review>

<text>This place is old school.
Chili Cheese burgers,  Chili Fries,   milkshakes
and...     a plethora of other tasty goods

not sure how healthy it is,   but hey       BETTER than McDonald's.</text>< user_name>
