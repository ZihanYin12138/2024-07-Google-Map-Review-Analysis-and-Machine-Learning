<Rating>5< /Rating><review>Great consumer service. Martin is an awesome guy. He gives a run down of all the services and does an excellent job with being fair with prices. The staff is super nice, helpful, and friendly. I went in one day and all my services were done by early next day. My family and I will definitely call them when needing car services. Definitely recommend!!</review>< Pics>

Never had any problems with my front breaks until Martin said they were going out. My car came back grinding and I practically had to slam all the way down to break. Took it back after a week, he said could be faulty breaks so he changed them.... STILL GRINDING A WEEK LATER! Never had this problem in our 25 years of owning vehicles. Never again! Going back to what we know. Paying a little more is better.<//text>

<Response>{'time': 1618104407783, 'text': 'Reviewed our invoice, and spoke to store manager Martin. We cannot find in our system a customer by the name "Tony Murua" or "Erica Murua". However, we do have a brake warranty job done to a customer with a 2018 Kia Optima on 4/10/2021. Prior to that, the customer came in on 3/29/21 requesting a rear brake pads replacement. However, customer did not request a road test inspection.\nWe remove the wheels and our visual brake inspection found that rear brake pads still have enough pad thickness based on industry standard, and the front brake pads has worn out to the point that need replacement. So we recommended, instead of replacing the rear brake pads as requested, customer should start with replacing the front brake pads and rotors (which come with a 3 year warranty), and customer authorized the recommendation.\nOn 4/10/21, customer came in saying "the brake does not feel normal." We re-inspected the work and went ahead to install another new set of brake pads without any charge.\nAfter the new pads replacement, we road tested the car and found the front brake was not making noise, but the rear is making some noise and customer was advised about it. We recommended doing further inspection on the rear brake but customer did not authorize.\nWe think this is the car that the reviewer is talking about, but we are not sure until the customer communicate further with us directly. So, this respected reviewer, please contact us assap to resolve your complaints. We will do our best to take care of your concerns. Thank you for giving us a chance to serve you.'}< /Response><gmap_id>0x80945df9bd675f6d:0xa09900a5b5138eb4<//gmap_id></record>

After giving this place a second chance seems to be alright.  They are always busy & the mechanic employees are friendly.  As for the the manager well he not too helpful yet the employee are great people.  Owner is good guy & my comment should reflect that for fairness.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>
{'time': 1608580294057, 'text': 'Hi Marc, Sorry that you are frustrated by your recent experience with our shop. Thank you for affirming that we did fix the problem of your car. Regarding the rate of our charges, we try to offer as reasonable a rate as possible. Many customers may feel that the rate is rather high looking at the price tag, but the reality is that our shop is barely able to break even. Everything is expensive, rent, wages, accounting, taxes, insurance, workers comp, tools, equipments, parts, warranty... just endless items we need to pay. We wish we can charge customers less, but so far, while everybody is always busy working, we still struggle to to pay all the bills. It is our goal to perform quality work at an affordable price, but it just cost a lot to run a business. Every job we do, we create an estimate and disclosures on what are and are not included in the job for customers like you to review and approve.  So, all works are done with a mutual agreement. Often times, especially with older cars, frequently, when one problem is repaired, other problems appeared. This is due to the the aging of all parts of the car. When work on older cars, in the process of removing and installing certain parts, surrounding parts, especially parts like aging wiring, hoses, sensors may fail without warning. Therefore, what we can do is to professional diagnose and fix a problem that is obvious, other problems that may emerge after the fix is beyond our responsibility, unless it is clearly caused by a mistake we made. Having said that, we still want to express our apology for your frustration.  You have been with us for about  4 years, and we want to thank you for being a loyal customer. Hopely, you may reconsider to use our service again. Wish you well and all the best.'}</response>

I would definitely recommend this place for anyone trying too get good honest work these guys are honest and show you exactly what's wrong with your car and will even show you the part that needs to be replaced for your own sake and don't try too over charge you for unnecessary repairs ive been too a few shops out here in fresno and they wouldn't even show me what parts recommend too change they would just write up a work order for some random things that I didn't even go in for and tell you your breaks and roaders need too be replaced asap yes im talking about pep"boys if your trying to get good honest work this is the place I went in for a ac/ recharge and that's exactly what I got checked for leaks found a leak coming from the valve stem showed me the issue asked me If I wanted it replaced for the ac unit would last longer and stop the leak charged me $20 extra not only replaced it for me and topped off my ac/unit in my car at no additional cost so I was a happy customer and would definitely recommend this place for those who don't know much about costly repairs and won't over charge like some places and make up issues that don't even  Existe and Make you pay for those repairs for no reason these guys will even call you over so you can see what the problem is and how much it will be and if you want too go ahead with the repairs ask for Martin they got a special right now $89. For full flush and check for any leaks and ac/recharge not bad pretty good price I called a few shops why over priced not to far from this place</text>

<Text>First I want to say how nice and friendly and professional Martin the owner is. He was very honest with me and made me feel very comfortable being a woman in a mechanic shop. His team are very friendly and professional and even dropped me off at home and picked me up when my car was done. He knew right away what the problem was and fixed it very quickly. He put in a water pump timing chain kit thermostat and my car is running great. They also have a two year warranty on labor and I thought that was wonderful. I would recommend everyone to go to discount auto and tires if you want your car needs fixed. I give them a 10 out of 10. Thank you again. I will be back for any of my car problems.< /Text>< Pics>

<Review>These guys are just AWESOME! I usually work on my own vehicles, however at times I find myself in need of professional help. And I took my first car here to have a AC pump replaced as I don't have the tools needed for that. I chose them that time because their estimate was only half what every one else wanted. They DID A EXCELLENT JOB VERY QUICKLY AND HALF PRICE OF OTHER SHOPS IN TOWN. CUSTOMER SERVICE IS TOP NOTCH TO MATCH. I've taken my vehicles in for various other serious issues over the past 3 years and EVERY TIME THE PRICE IS UNBEATABLE THE CUSTOMER CARE SERVICE IS ABOVE WHAT IT SHOULD BE (these days that's uncommon) AND THEY ARE VERY GOOD AT WHAT THEY DO. NO TRYING TO ADD EXTRA THINGS YOU DON'T NEED THEY LISTEN TO YOU THE GIRLS IN THE OFFICE, THE MECHANICS, AND MOST OF ALL THE FLOOR MANAGER MARTIN IS JUST A REALLY REALLY COOL GUY. JESSICA AND THE OTHER GIRL IN THE OFFICE ARE EASY TO TALK TOO AS IS MARTIN THEY ARE VERY INFORMATIVE NEVER TRYING TO GET EXTRA MONEY FROM YOU INSTEAD THEY TRY TO KEEP COST TO YOU AS LOW AS POSSIBLE YET REPAIR THE PROBLEMS THE CORRECT WAY THAT WILL LAST FOREVER. I'M SERIOUS AND I KNOW THESE SHOPS WHEN I SAY DON'T TO ANYWHERE ELSE IT'S BECAUSE YOUR JUST NOT GONNA FIND A BETTER BUNCH OF FOLKS WHO CAN DO AS GOOD A JOB AND KEEP IT LOT COST HIGH QUALITY AS THESE GUYS. MARTIN HAS REMEMBERED MY NAME AS WELL AS MY WHOLE FAMILY SINCE DAY WE MET. HE'S JUST A REAL GUY AND THEY HAVE PLENTY OF CUSTOMERS SO DON'T NEED TO TRY AND PULL YOUR LEG TO GET YOUR MONEY THEY JUST KEEP IT REAL AND SIMPLE AND YET THOROUGH AND ALWAYS WILLING TO GO THE EXTRA MIKE PLUS SOME. I CAN'T SAY ENOUGH ABOUT THIS WHOLE ESTABLISHMENT. DON'T TAKE MY WORD GIVE THEM A CALL AND THEN CALL OTHER SHOPS COMPARE PRICES, AND SERVICE YOU'LL SEE HOW RIGHT I AM. From the initial call itself on the phone you'll recognize the excellent customer care the girls in the office provide and if you choose them in the end you'll probably be like me and consider Martin as a friend more than just your mechanic. And you'll never have to go back for a second fix on the same issue cause when it leaves their shop it's FIXED AND DONE RIGHT. Best part is you won't go BROKE trying to keep your car going. I never thought I would say it but I TRUST THIS SHOP WITH ALL MY VEHICLES AND EVEN MY FAMILY THEY WILL TAKE CARE OF YOU LIKE YOUR FAMILY AS WELL. GIVE THEM A TRY SEE WHAT YOU SAY. I BET MY FAVORITE VEHICLE YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED. SO ALL THE WAY AROUND 5 STAR PLUS 5 MORE FOR SERVICE QUALITY AND PRICE THEY ARE JUST UNBEATABLE.< /Review><response>{'time': 1595948213350, 'text': 'Chad!

<review>I really liked the friendly staff and Martin explained everything in detail so that I could have a good understanding of the repair cost.  Also, I really like the hours and although they close early which I don’t blame them with this heat they open bright and early so it’s my kinda place. 👍</review>< pictures>

I was looking for help with my car and found the help I needed at Martin auto shop. I encountered his mobile website after cross referencing others. Honest, reliable, and surprisingly fair he helped get the peace of mind I needed with my vehicle. I will be going back for the awesome and great service I received. I am grateful and humble to Martin and his staff @ Discount Auto &Tires! Thanks again 🙏🏻😎😊✊<//Review>

My car was unable to pass smog because the "check engine" light kept coming on. I took my car to Discount Auto & Tires and they were able to find out what the problem was, fix it, and get the car to pass smog all within a day. I loved how fast they were able to fix everything.<//text>

I was very pleased with the service I received today by the service manager and the staff at Discount Auto and Tires in Fresno. They are very friendly and courteous and got the job done. I went In to have my bumpers touched up and they did a fabulous job matching the color. The price was inexpensive and I am amazed with the outcome with the paint job! I plan on bringing my car in for future repairs. Thanks guys, you are the best!< /Text>

Noticed a problem with my steering yesterday. I was so happy to have extra money this month but of course my car knows when i get paid. SO going to give this business a try due to reviews looking positive and affordable. I wish I was a baller.
Well back and I got good service and clear communication on the issues with my car and the cost. Best of all made small talk with two customers and we had some good laughs, neither had one negative thing to say about the business that's a good sign.</review>

His word means nothing - A Con guy who don't deserve to be trusted.  Be aware, this guy will over charge you by hundreds of dollars. I just might report him to the Better Business Bureau.< /review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>
{'time': 1560818620905, 'text': 'Hi,\nThank you for posting a review of your experience with us. We are sorry that your felt the way you stated in your review.\nI just spoke with Martin and he cannot recall a customer with the name of your post :Lorena Martinez". We also don\'t have a customer in our system with that name.\nSo, base on what you wrote, we guessed that you may be that customer who left stating that you would write a negative review.\nAssuming that you are that customer, Martin said that you brought in a   2008 Scion xB for an AC service because it was blowing hot air. Also, you came recommended by one of our technician Mr. C who had worked on your car from home.\nYou ordered  an A/C recharge service of $89.99 which includes up to 2 lb of freon. The service does not include diagnostic but entails: pressure testing for leaks, visual inspection for AC  belt condition, inspect if AC clutch will kick on before and after recharge, and recharge.  It does not guarantee that the AC system will perform normally.\nThe inspection and pressure test did not indicate leaks on other area but the service valve. He recommended replacing the service valve and you approve it.\nSo he vacuumed the system and charged the system with freon and AC oil according to specs.  After that he found that the compressor would not kick on and he informed you.\nAt this point you got upset and began distrusting Martin assuming that he should have should told you if the compressor is bad before the recharge service. You were not happy to pay for the service and still have a non working AC.\nThe fact is that the service is not a diagnostic service but standard inspection and recharge service which is to ensure that freon will not leak out after recharge. It does not guarantee that the AC system will perform normally.\nYou asked for a price quote to replace the compressor and 3 different prices was given: for used, manufactured and new compressor with kits. You declined all the recommendations.\nTo be of good business to you, he even offered to reclaim the freon and charge it back for you at no charge even if you were to install the compressor elsewhere.\nYou actually did that (cheaper of course with someone who does not have shop overheads) and came back to get the system recharged. He still took extra time to redo a leak test and then recharge for you at no charge. He even gave you a free diagnostic and found that the AC did work and produce cool air but the AC fan was not turning on. But out of your distrust of him, you claimed that he caused it, and got really upset. And you left stating that you will write us a very bad review.\nReviewing the case, we are sorry that we cannot offer better options for you. However, I think Martin has handled the situation in a very professional manner. By the way, you found our price quote to be very expensive and claimed that we over charge customers. The fact is that our price cannot be very low, but the lowest we can offer our customer with respect to our high shop overheads and faithful and extended warranty.\nFinally, we felt sorry that we could not do better to make you happy and would like to wish you the best of luck in finding a mechanic or shop that you are happy with.'}< /Resp>

My first experience with Discount Auto was for an AC service last summer and was so pleased with the experience that I've been a repeat customer ever since. I've owned a lot of vehicles over the years and have done a lot of maintenance on them myself but will leave the more involved problems to the professionals. With that said, I know when someone is trying to increase the bill by preforming unneeded repair and or way over charging for the replacement parts. This shop is upfront and honest and keeps you informed on the job as it progresses. If they notice a potential problem that might compromise the work being performed they will notify you first and suggest at your choice to address the issue. Im a believer in spending a little more for an unseen issue now than having to do it later and pay for the same labor again. In conclusion,  if you're in need of an auto shop that provides excellent service with a high level of customer appreciation look no further than Discount Auto.<//Text><Rate>5</Rate>< user_id>

< Review>
Came early  to discount  auto and tires today hoping to get my sunroof fixed .  At arriving at the shop I was immediately greeted by the co-owner Diego. He asked how can I help you today?  I told him my sunroof was not working he then invited me into the office had me fill out paperwork and promptly showed me where the restroom was and offered me water.. His service is very generous and kind. The quote he gave me to fix my sunroof was unbelievable compared to $1680 at the dealer... I paid $490.
For anyone out there looking for a great honest mechanic shop do not hesitate to come here to discount auto and tires this will be your 1 stop shop for any of your services and repairs.  The staff here can fix anything no doubt about it .🙂< /Review>

Quick and efficient service. Got an oil change done. They charge $18 for a regular oil change, but I got full synthetic so it was $38. Very decent price for me. Not much of a wait. Buddy was super friendly and helpful and got me out in an hour.</text>

{'time': 1524156561807, 'text': 'Hi Breeshemah,\nI am sorry that our service was not provided in the manner that meet your expectation. We took customer satisfaction and complaint very seriously, so I reviewed your situation with our service team and found out as follows:\nYour husband ordered a couple of tires and you came in for installation and it was done in a professional and timely manner. When installing your tires, we give you a courtesy inspection of your rear brake and found out that they needed replacement. We recommended to you to replace your brake pads and you authorize. Immediately, we proceed to order the brake pads for installation and wait for the pads to arrive. And this is where your complaint arose. The pads ordered took longer than usual to come in, about 45 minutes. You were unhappy and have to go. So we put your wheels together for you to go and arranged for you to come back the next day for installation with the pads ready in our store. And to extend our apology for the inconvenience it caused you, we offered to fully waived the brake pads installation labor of $70 dollars. Your came in the next day and we installed the brake pads as promised. Again, we apologize for the inconvenience we have caused you.'}<//Response>

{'time': 1556081724020, 'text': 'After reading the review, we are concerned if we made mistake or performed a substandard service.\nOur investigation found that we have only one record  of a Mark Miller repair service that was done about one year ago on 4/2/2018. We examined the invoice and try recalling what went on. As we remember it: the customer came in with a complaint on a job that was done by a technician that has left us.\nWe tried our best to respond to his complaints. It was a AC repair service that he claimed that was done in our shop, but he did not have a receipt to prove it and we also have no record of the service in our system.\nGiven that, we still take his complaint in good faith, did an inspection and replace several faulty parts without charging installation labor  and a free freon recharge. After that, he did not come back with any further complaints.\nIf Mark have further complaints, we would like to see what we can to to help out.'}< /response>

My experience wasn't very pleasant here.  One of the guys was a gentleman while the other two were very unprofessional, simply ignoring the customer while idle gossiping on their job as if the customer's presence meant nothing to them, you know trying to make the customer wait as long as possible.  I wouldn't recommend this place to a friend.

I'm a Senior Citizen looking for a friendly place who will appreciate my business.  Going here ruined my day.   These guys should learn to treat all customers fairly with dignity    Friendly over the phone but not in person.  The owner of this business is friendly, polite and a true gentleman.<//review>

<Review>I went there this morning when they opened to get a standard alignment done since the night prior i installed some coilovers to my vehicle, got sent to the waiting room and waited then roughly 40 minutes later said its done to go pay the cashier, I asked beforehand for a print out of my specs is i just wanted my toe fixed, he said he didn't have it so I asked to see the numbers on the computer and again turned me down, so I never seen if they acually aligned it or any #'s to prove so, instead the guy told the cashier to just write down toe is set to 0 on the receipt which means nothing, I went and paid the amount unhappily, writing the review 4 1/2 hours later because I went to another alignment shop for a free alignment check and when I was showed the numbers  toe was never fixed, it was way off so I had to pay the same amount to the second shop to fix it but atleast they did fix it and seen numbers on computer that there to specs, never again going to this place for any needs and will recommend my friends and family to another place while telling them my experience here at this location, if you get an alignment done here please ask for a print out< /Review>< Rating>

I get to eat here a lot since I work nearby. I have to say the service is always great and they keep the spot clean consistently. Pricing is convenient and they serve sizeable portions.<//review>

This is a well kept secret. The outside is unassuming but the food on the inside is outstanding. Reasonably priced with some excellent daily specials. I got one of the specials, steak and shrimp. The steak was a sirloin which is hard to cook correctly but it was excellent. A nice selection of side dishes as well.<//Text>

<rating>4</rating><review>A good steak at a reasonable price. I had always been curious about this place, and driven by many a time but never went in. We've now visited them twice and have been thoroughly impressed. Their steaks are of high quality and were cooked exactly to my and my wife's liking. Looking forward to trying their house steak next time. The prices are very reasonable and their staff friendly and attentive. Great value for money if you're interested in a casual dining experience in a family friendly, western themed steak house.<//review><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None<//Response><Gmap_id>0x80dd291fce1bac1d:0xc9726c6be8043267< /Gmap_id></record>

<review>I went with a group from work with very low expectations for lunch. To all of our suprise, the food was beyond reasonably priced and the food and service were terrific given the price. Yes I have had better food but for the price I would have to say this place is hard to beat.</review><GmapID>0x80dd291fce1bac1d:0xc9726c6be8043267</GmapID>< Name>

Good food, dated decor. Food was a good value. Service was prompt. The dining room can use an update because it looks like it's straight out of the 1970s/80s with the gold accents, mirrored walls, and faux plants. Be warned, they charge a $2 service fee if you split a plate.<//review>

Great food, a comfortable Midwestern atmosphere, and affordable prices. I highly recommend one of the dinner combos like the "Trio". It isn't on the menu, but you get a 6oz bacon wrapped steak, shrimp, and a quarter rack of baby back ribs. Also comes with toast and your choice of a side.

I love this place, and it has become a big part of my life and the life of my family. I'm sure it will become a mainstay for you as well.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None</response>< gmapID>

<text>8/20/2017 - This is Golden Steer's very last day they are now permanently closed. They had Good food, great steaks, affordable prices and friendly attentive staff. There was something on the menu for everyone, even for picky eaters. Sad to see them close, we have been coming here for a long time and we could always count on this restaurant for their consistent menu, quality and friendliness.<//text><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None<//resp><Gmap_id>0x80dd291fce1bac1d:0xc9726c6be8043267</Gmap_id></record>

My parents ate here daily when they had a nearby business. Many years ago. Renamed and different. Mediocre food. They have great priced 7.99 lunch specials. I got the lemon chicken. Didn't taste like lemon. Overcooked. Boring plain salad. Next time I might try the burger. 2017</Text>

<review>Nice, friendly staff. Ordered the house speciality steak, medium well - was very good. They have their own steaksauce which I enjoyed better than A-1. My daughter liked the children's fried shrimp plate, which came with an ice cream dessert. The only bad review I have is for interior decor- it can definitely use some freshening up. Other than that,  food was great :)< /review>< rating>

If I could give it 1/2 a star I would!!! Idk why this place has 4stars IT DONT DESERVE IT... Let's start off w t entrance, t sign outside, Tnk u for t warning but omg that should of send us running! It said not to leave ur valuables in t car cuz we could b broken into, something like that, yeah great!! Then way t manager Armando was on my visit.. He seemed upset cuz we were a large party. He should of been happy he was getting customers cuz that place was a dead! T smell of t place was damp n smelled like old dirty carpet.. When it was time to order he said to all is all 1 check, right??!! But w an attitude.. Again as if they were soooo busy that they couldn't accommodate us. The waitress Christine was t sweetest kindest person there, thank u Christie u should b working some where else where u attributes would shine cuz ur very kind! When we got our drinks t girl who was helping our waitress started throwing t straws to everyone on t table, it was raining straws, really RUDE! Now let's get into t food, my friend n I order t Philly Cheese sandwich, I ordered t soup YUCK 🤢 it's not homemade n super salty! Christine was kind enough to change it for t salad, now that was very good!! Then t sandwich, where do I begin?! T meat must of been cooked a day or more ago n reheated cuz it was rough n chewie, it didn't have enough cheese n when I asked if they could plz add a lil bit more t manager told me it was an extra .69 cents more but w body expression of really n w his hands on his waist n w just plain old rudeness.. I said okay, His like we'll give me ur plate n I'll put it on myself... NO WAY!! I just told him to bring it out, when it was brought out it was nice n cold! Yeah! When it came time to pay again t waitress was so sweet we left her a nice tip cuz she deserved it! But t manager whom was charging, didn't even made eye contact n seemed like we were taking him away from more important things. Felt as if he was thinking "give me ur money n get t heck out!" I asked for a receipt, cuz I always do he seemed annoyed that I ask. He gave it to me like "here, now go, leave!" Again as if we were not important, he didn't even asked how was ur meal was everything okay?! Nothing!! After we left digestion started I got t worst stomach pain, n gases ever! DONT WAIST UR MONEY, time here! I would of rather go eaten at a fast food place. To the staff here, U DONT THROW STRAWS OR NAPKINS, u cook ur food fresh, ASK ur costomers how was everything? And most important TREAT UR COSTOMERS W A SMILE N CURTESY!! If it wasn't for t nice waitress I would of given this place 1/4 of a star!!</Text>

< Review>
My husband and I was craving BBQ yesterday so we decided to give The Famous Rib Shack a try. And let me tell you, we were NOT disappointed!!!
I had the beef ribs my husband had the pork ribs both along with potato salad, mac n cheese, collard greens and peach cobbler for our sides. Everything and I do mean everything was delicious!! The cherry on top was the awesome customer service provided by our gracious hostess Mae who was super nice and made us feel so welcome. We'll definitely be going back soon!< /Review>

Delicious food, ribs were smooth and smoky, sauce was wonderful.
Thank you May for the delicious MOTHER'S day dinner,  and for the little extra surprise you so generously included. We will definitely be back for more.<//review>

We got a slab of pork ribs today and I only have two words...
Excellent!
Recommend!!
The meat was very tender, moist and just about fall off the bone.
Been passing by here for many years and always forgot to stop by. Now that I've been there .. I'll be back to check out the rest of the menu.
The Louisiana fried chicken sounds good.< /Text>

<review>Home cooking and well worth any wait - Let me be clear.  I have been to this place off and on for 30 years.  This mother daughter team is the real deal.  They have apparently had the place for 5 years and I missed the boat.  Went in today as they often close for catering, or run out of food.  Which is a VERY good thing.

The pork ribs were tender as could be.  The sauce was sweet and spice, just a delight.  The links were spice but not hot and the sauce complimented them perfectly.  I can't wait to go back and try the Sunday spread.

Again, worth the wait.  Now that I missed them for the last 5 years, I recommend a "Grand Opening" or "New owners" sign to get the word out.  I will  spread the word to all my peeps and hope to see greater things from these owners.

Awesome!< /review>< GmapID>

Stop reading past this review and just go there!

Order anything and it's amazing. It's all homemade recipes with Mama May and Lil May. Ribs, love em. Chicken, delish. Specials... I advise you try them. Also, grab a cup of Peach Sweet Tea. Collard greens are amazing if you know what's good for ya, but all the sides are great.

Pricing is reasonable for some home cooking and seasoning made from pure love. I don't want to know their secrets because I want them to stay a staple in the community.

Ignore the old reviews from past owners, and just try it for yourself. Parking in front is limited,but there's always street parking nearby.

Worst thing that can happen is you end up spending more than you thought because you're busy ordering the entire menu and returning to them spending more for another outstanding meal.

The meal in the picture was a fried chicken sandwich with coleslaw and a sweet sauce. Sides of crawfish mac n cheese, collard greens, and potato salad. Across the way is BBQ chicken with the top notch sauce. Peach tea all around and the best desert you can imagine after... Honey bourbon corn bread!

I love this place and I love these two amazing women. Their customer service is top notch. Have a chat, tell a story, get a hug, and leave happy!<//Text>

<Review>Tried the pork ribs and burnt ends combo last night along with coleslaw and collard greens. I also wanted some of their peach cobbler but arrived too late and they were out. Burnt ends were excellent, very smokey flavored and just grilled enough to have some crispiness on the edges. Pork ribs also excellent - smokey, meaty, juicy - and carmelized just enough with the sauce on top. BTW -their delicious burnt ends are not on the menu, you have to know to ask for them - now I hope next time there will still be some left by time I arrive! In recent weeks I have also tried their beef ribs (meaty, smokey, juicy - another winner!) and Sunday Fried Chicken (crispy, crunchy, honey dipped, Mmmmm!). Famous Rib Shack is a hidden gem!< /Review>< pics>

<Rate>5</Rate><Review>The food is not the only reason to go to this quirky Southern food restaurant. The pork ribs were tender, smoked and tasty. The coleslaw fresh and flavoursome. All topped off with lovey Mac n Cheese and Cornbread. Mamma May and May made a visitor from London feel as if he was being invited into their home. Left after having some laughs, chat about their cooking and a welcome hug to say goodbye. A visit here is a must.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

First time here for lunch. I ordered the Brisket to go. I was handed the credit card reader for what I thought was to sign, but it was asking for the Tip amount. Why ask for a Tip when I have not seen or tasted the food ?
I was handed the brisket,  very small 9oz plastic container of very saucy Bits and Pieces for $15.00  seems a bit pricey,  $30.00 a pound?  Why I did not get a slice of Brisket with a choice of sauce.  Good thing I ordered some coleslaw because the very saucy bits and pieces were very salty.

<user_name>Jim Hutchings< /user_name><review>It was decent... But for the hefty price, I expected more. I had the ribs and they were solid, but nowhere near amazing. The mac and cheese was just ok and the potato salad was inedible (tasted like it was bought at a grocery store in a large tub). Maybe I caught them on an off night. The service was awesome though. Super friendly and sweet.<//review>< Gmap_id>

A family owed BBQ Shack, the food is amazing!! The best barbeque around. The baby back ribs are so sweet, tender and succulent.  The chicken is the perfect amount of smokey and plump. The links are robust with flavor. The mac n' cheese with the wide noodles, garlic and variety of cheeses.... please understand you can not rush perfection... the food is worth the wait....< /text>

$27/person will get you much better BBQ elsewhere. We paid $81 for takeout that barely amounted to 3 sad plates. The ribs were mediocre, chicken was overdone, and the sides given were barely enough for one person. I think their glory days are behind them. Hopefully it bounces back.<//review>

I got take-out for the first time about a month ago, and my husband and I loved it!  I got the pork ribs and beef brisket, macaroni & cheese, collard greens and corn bread. The meats were tender, juicy, and smoked perfectly, and the sauce and seasonings complimented the meat well; some places I go overpower the meat with theirs. The mac & cheese was creamy and had a nice hint of garlic. The collard greens were traditionally prepared, so very tender and smoky. The cornbread was almost like cake - soft and honey-sweetened. They seemed a bit pricey, but good food like this takes time and effort. I'll definitely be back!<//text>

the poorly smoked ribs and dry chicken were under seasoned. the sauce was sticky and too sweet; no character, no kick, canned?. the poorly developed baked beans did not appear baked with the typical rich, thick flavorful sauce. with the inclusion of pineapple bits, the corn muffin was actually a pineapple muffin. there was no attempt at authenticity, no attempt at presenting honest barbecued food.</text>

Omg I had never heard of this place and found it on a fluke.  My wife earlier in the day said she wanted bbq and low and behold we found this little gem.   The food was absolutely amazing.  Wish I would have found this place sooner.   I had the rib plate with potato salad and greens.  I was stuffed but because it was so good I almost ordered more.  If your looking for some good bbq in the peninsula please stop by and show them some love.< /Review>

Love the BBQ and the wings here. I'm excited that I was in the neighborhood tonight so I could pick up dinner from here... used to get it more often. The brisket is always delicious ans full of flavor and they do something with the wings to make them way better than just about anyplace else; comparable in size and taste to Roscoe's in Los Angeles. Oh and the sweet potato pie and cobblers are yummy too, although I don't think they make those onsite. The Mac and cheese is a little unusual; definitely more homemade tasting than many places, though my kids don't like it (less homogeneous than Kraft for example).<//Text>

Walked into the establishment and was greeted by a nice lady informing me that “there are a couple people ahead of you and the wait is at least 15 minutes.  Also we only take cash”. Um, ok.  So I check my wallet to see how much cash I have so I can order. I wait 5 minutes as she was preparing an order. She came out and I asked about the pork rib dinner and if they offer a brisket dinner option. She tells me “we are out of pork and brisket.” What?!?  It’s dinner time!  Before I can respond, she says “Thank you” and walks away. Ok. I get the hint. They don’t want my business. I was actually deciding on other options, but she left me no choice but to walk away.  This was the last chance.< /text>

<review>When is this place open?! Went at 7pm on a Tuesday night and 8pm on a Thursday night (after the owner told us this was the day to come!) and both times shut! The opening hours on this listing need updating to reflect its actual business hours, same for the TripAdviaor page. Sorry for the one star as the food may well be great, but I can't see how anyone who is visiting the area will ever get to experience it.<//review><pics>None</pics>< resp>

I miss Southern Style BBQ. Food was delish! Collard green and ham. I haven't had that in a loong, time. I ordered the BBQ Chicken. Just I expected. Yum! The Ladies are super, sweet, and welcoming. I felt right at home and home-cooked food. No picture available. Pretty much downed it! Lol</review>

I've seen this place change owners over the years, and it's slowly getting better. The ribs are not quite fall-off-the-bone, but they are still good with the sauce. I remember they used to make a really good cornbread muffin, but that recipe got lost somehow, unfortunately.</review>

If Jesus had BBQ at the last supper, he would have ordered it from The Famous Rib Shack. Mama May and Little May make the best ribs I've ever eaten, and I try every BBQ joint I pass. They converted my fiancé from a rib skeptic to a rib nut.

Other reviews say FRS is slow or expensive, but guys, have you ever eaten Barbeque before?!?!?! There is no such thing as cheap or fast BBQ (if it's good). If you're in a hurry that day, don't eat BBQ. This stuff is made with pure love, and love takes time.

Treat yourself to some of the May's finest cooking, and their southern hospitality. You'll feel like you stepped right back into your momma's kitchen, except your mother never made anything so delicious as Mama May's barbeque.</Text>

<Rating>1< /Rating><Text>Worst bbq joint around. I have eaten here twice now before reviewing just to give it a fair shot. I hate to not give a place a chance before giving a negative review. To start I bought the lunch special with beef ribs, I received three tiny ribs with very little meat on them, then the meat was so tough that I could only get about a bite or two of actually chewable meat per rib, they didnt even ask if I wanted the bbq sauce on them or on the side and they slathered so much sauce that tasted like slightly modified canned sauce from a store that the ribs were drowning. The sides were ok, but very small portions, beans and collard greens but nothing worth coming back for. And the cornbread tasted like corn cake the had a pool of what I imagine to be butter sitting on the bottom. I have eaten at many amazing bbq places here and throughout the nation as well as worked in two and this place is so overpriced and lacking. For this area gorilla bbq in Pacifica is the place to go.<//Text>< pictures>

I thought my GF and I had struck gold when they allowed us to come inside even though they were only open on Christmas Day for "special to go orders". The food was good and we were very pleased, until the bill came...I was charged over $45 for just one single stack of ten small ribs, 2 pieces of cornbread, and a single can of coke! I still tipped $5 cuz, well it was the holiday but this experience left me still searching for a good rib joint...waaay too expensive!</review>

The rib shack was a great place to eat, now the  rib shack may be one of the worst places to eat. Today hot links taste like warm links from your local supermarket, The potato salad taste bad,and I was scared to eat it. The Brisket didn't melt in your mouth like in the past. This  waste of my hard earn money.< /Review>

<Review>Advertised as world's best ribs. What I got was the world's worst.  The ribs were overcooked and dry. They were not tender, or moist, or juicy. If I get ribs like this at a chinese restaurant, I send them back, but at the rib shack, I had to throw out half of them. This experience has turned me off of ribs.</Review><response>None<//response><Pictures>None</Pictures><GmapID>0x808f777c62356b4d:0x54b978c30a50c67c</GmapID><name>Jordan Casing Company</name><UserId.>102308423902612354040<//UserId.>< rating>

We were driving by the other night and saw this place and decided to check it out, they were closed but the owner Lottie invited us in to look around and "I'll give you a sample!"
The sample was SOOOO good we came back tonight for dinner.  I love baby back ribs and my wife loves beef ribs.  We got both. The pork ribs were succulent, flavorful and some of the best I have ever had, the beef ribs were HUGE, cooked erfectly and delicious.  Both the mild sauce and the hot sauce (we got them on the side) were terrific but we liked the hot a bit more.. The corn bread was out of this world as were the sides. Collard greens with flecks of ham, macaroni & cheese, coleslaw.  We left stuffed and with doggie bags.  We will be back for sure. The food was great, the owner is a sweetheart and the service was wonderful.< /review>

This place a is a little hard to rate.

Food is great.
Service is slow but very friendly (Not enough staff)
Restaurant is small but clean, not enough parking.
Cheapest menu item is around $12 and 3 ribs around $16. They ribs and bbq sauce are great so the amount you pay for the food is worth it. However, when you realize that you spent $50 for two ribs sets of 3 and 2 drinks + tips it makes you think about other local alternatives (Olive Garden, BJs, chillis).

- if you are craving some good ribs and dont care about the location or you are not in a rush this is the place to go.< /Text>

Extremely unprofessional restaurant. They have cancelled two orders we have placed online with them and on both occasions have charged us for the order and not refunded the account. Filing a formal dispute with our bank and with Eat24. Don't order online from this location you may find yourself without food and nearly ) $100 dollars</Text>

My favorite place for a quick, yummy pizza. My biggest issue is the personal size is bigger than I should eat in one sitting, but smaller than one I would stop half-way through for leftovers!<//review>

<Date>1581807810036<//Date><review>Awesome pizza, prices, and employees. If you look at their deals online it's pretty amazing. It's cheap yet they don't lack in quality. We went there on Valentine's day and their store was FLOODED with orders but they still managed to get our order at a reasonable time. They had to call in all their staff even if it wasn't their shift so they deserve extra tip!<//review>< Name>

Disgusting pizza. Greasy and salty but entirely flavorless. The dough, sauce, etc just taste like salt and nothing else. Never thought I'd say this but Domino's is better AND cheaper.</Text>

Far too much salt. According to their website 550mg sodium per slice which ends up being 6000mg sodium per pizza, or 3 times the recommended daily max. There is no reason to have so much salt in a pizza. This should be clearly advertised as it is very dangerous.</Text>

<text>OMG this place is amazing. First off I'm a over the road truck driver and I really wanted some pizza so I called and Mr. Tony(AMAZING) recommended the  sweet chili pizza I think which is really good. But I ordered from the wrong location and didn't find out til my food was out for delivery. They still brought me the food. What a God send. God bless you guys. If I'm ever close by again I will order again!!!!!< /text>< rate>

<review>I actually did not get any pizza here. I had received a coupon for a free personal pizza, but upon arriving with the coupon, the staff proceeded to tell me that they were out of supplies for the pizza. It was apparent that they were making pizza in the back so I am really unsure of what supplies they could possibly be missing to make their smallest pizza.
Will try again for different results. :/<//review><Name>Ron Phillips</Name><Rate>3</Rate>< GmapID>

Extremely good Customer Service and super friendly. They are not afraid to make conversation with you. Most importantly the wait was not long at all. You can just sit down eat your delicious food and watch the games.< /review>

Management changed! This place is way better than it was a few months ago, the inside is super clean and everyone that works there now is super cool. Diverse staff mixed with a few students and locals. Prices and ingredients are great too.</review>

<review>We ordered a pizza on the phone at 6:20 pm. The person on the phone told us to come and pick it up in 20 mins. We arrived and asked for our pizza. They told us to give them a couple more minutes. We waited there until 7:20 pm. They finally gave us our pizza. I was really hot when I realized they hadn't put in our pizza in the oven until 7 pm. Got the pizza at 7:15 pm.

Moral of the story: Don't order a pizza from here and if you do, order it an hour before.< /review>< rating>

The customer service is awful. I was told 20 min before closing that they were no longer accepting new orders. Guess she had something more important to do then her job. She did however let me know they would be open tomorrow at 11. Great... Will not be eating here again</review>

Absolutely the worst bank in Merced. Long lines. business line only haves 1 person so be prepared to wait. Do not bank here if you are a business. They will just waste your time. This bank has a 1 star rating for a reason. Don't blame the tellers the tellers are really nice I feel bad they have to work at such a unprofessional business. it's not there fault the bank manager has no brain cells. Look at the reviews this has been going on for years.< /review>

For those that complain about wait time and how this bank doesn't care for their customers need to cool it. There are other ways to get your transactions done. ATM, online or having your job deposit your check into your account so you can avoid the wait time. I was there a few days ago and......sure they didn't have enough tellers but yelling at the manager or the other workers does not solve the issue especially if you don't have your accounts there. Go to your bank! If you are there it's because you want to. I see this all the time I go into this branch and it makes me laugh!

Don't blame the workers and managers I'm sure if they had a choice to hire more people they would have along time ago. It's up to those people way above in the company that make the big changes. It's like any other big company!< /Review>< Pictures>

I have to use this bank to cash.my employers checks.
I HATE this branch. Literally every single time I have gone there in the last year and a half, I have had to wait AT LEAST  45 minutes in line for a teller .
I've gone there at many different times of day . Always the same horrid service.
This branch is very poorly managed, always understaffed.  I have yet to see more than 3 tellers on duty at any one time, regardless of how many people are in line.
I use Bo A all over the state. This is the only branch I've ever been to that is consistently a terrible experience.
And I'm going to put this out there. .  The customers are 98%Hispanic. I think the sub-par service at this branch is because the management sees their clients as less deserving of good service.
Bank of America corp. needs to look into why THIS branch is so poorly managed.<//Text>

< Review>
This place is comedy.  Long lines every day no matter what day of the month it is with only one or two tellers at a time.  WORST banking experience I have ever had anywhere, ever.  Someone should be held accountable for this.  Maybe someone should call the Better Business Bureau.<//Review>

<Review>Staff are helpful and nice. Most of the time only 1 or 2 teller windows are open, which makes service really slow. They also need to stay open until at least 5:30pm.<//Review>< Time>

Long wait-time and has only two people working the counter during peak times, ridiculous. This branch does not even deserve a one-star.<//review>

Every time I come in there are huge lines. This is rediculous. Talk about poor customer service and satisfaction.

Very comfortable, but wasn't big on space when it came to opening new accounts. There was a limited amount of space, but it was a pleasure to meet the personal accountant. Love the accountant who I dealt with & I hope to deal with in the future.<//text>

<text>My god, this place is HORRIBLE. There's no other place in Merced that I hate as much as this Bank of America. Get more tellers and MAYBE we'll talk. My only regret ever is banking with this place. I instantly get into a bad mood when I enter the bank because I already know I have to wait a really long time before I can see a teller and it upsets me because I have other things to do. This bank is not convenient what so ever and I hope God has mercy on all their souls. jk no I don't. I literally hate this place.  I would give it negative stars if I could.<//text><name>Fernando Tovar</name><Pictures>None</Pictures>< rate>

Worst bank ever!! you have to wait in a long ass line for 30+ mins just for a simple transaction! that is why i'm with a credit union now! much shorter and faster lines at a credit union.
If i had the option to give NO stars I would. This bank doesn't even deserve my ONE star.<//review>

This bank does not care about its customers.  Do not open an account here in Merced.  You will be sorry.  Long, LONG lines & they refuse to hire extra tellers on the days when they are the busiest.  Waiting of up to an hour and a half is not uncommon.<//Review>

<text>The banking experience is so bad at this Merced Bank Of America (long lines, not enough tellers, etc.) that I have literally been driving out to Atwater to complete my banking transactions at their B of A (no lines & my transaction is always done under 5 minutes).  After the first of the year, I'm switching to a different bank altogether.<//text>< rate>

I love the workers! They treat all of the volunteers with respect and are always making sure that we're doing ok. They always want the best for their volunteers and are always grateful for us when we show up. Grateful for them.</text>

Point Sal has been my favorite hike for years. After years of drought and seen it completely brown and dry. It is back to its glory. I haven't seen so much green and so many different flowers in all the years I have visited as I saw this past weekend.</text>

Truly quite the spectacle once you arrive at the beach. Long hike, the whole walk consist of fire roads.</review>

This used to be completely undeveloped. It was a hard hike to get there (7 miles and 7 miles out, if I recall correctly). It was completely cut off from the world -- a little slice of paradise that you could usually have all to yourself. Now, it seems as though it has been developed. This makes me a little sad, but I can tell you, it's a beautiful place. You probably won't regret going.<//text>

An incredible hike, amazing beach, totally deserted!  Got to hike in during heavy fog which cleared as I sat on the beach. One of the best ocean views I’ve ever seen.< /review>

<text>Point Sal State Beach is one of my favorites. It's good for taking friends and family for a day on the beach, easy swimming as well as playing in the water. It's easy to get to and the parking is no problem.< /text><Resp>None< /Resp><Name>Adriana Van Der Graaf</Name>< userid>

Less wind and fog than down at Pismo Beach  or Grover Beach.  Nice cove, restaurants and gift shops line the street.</Review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Review>Excellent fairly strenuous hike with amazing views of Vandenberg airforce base to the South (On clear days you can even see the oil platforms off the coast near Goleta) and Pismo and Avila to the North. Stay on the trail as the beginning of the hike is on private property and at the top of the hill is Vandenberg property. No facilities and be sure to bring lots of water especially if you decide to go all the way down to the beach as coming back up the hill can be quite difficult especially at midday, I have seen bikes here but am not sure if they are allowed. Dogs can be on leash. As the parking location is a bit isolated be sure to not leave any valuables in your car or carry them with you. My car has been broken in here and I think it happens pretty often as I have seen window glass several times.<//Review>< user>

Love washing my car here. Sometimes it is busy but haven’t waited longer than 10 minutes. After you wash your car there is a place for you to vacuum your car. Vacuum is not free. If you need to detail your car their is a place for you to do that as well. Their are change machines there for you to get money to wash your car with. After 11 pm it’s $1 for 4 minutes.< /text>

Cool. Even better if you wash between 12:00am and 5:00am. After I wash and pull up to.the vacumn area, I was a little disappointed this company took away the tireshine that used to.be on.the vacumn pump</review>

<text>Having been to many coin operated car washes in Los Angeles,  I can say this is one of the best. It has great strong vaccumes (if you've ever used a weak vaccum you know how important a strong one is), a dryer option after wash and foam conditioner among other things. 5 stars.<//text><pics>None< /pics><Response>None</Response>< gmapID>

Do it yourself carwash. It gets a little busy at times, but the wait for me has never been too long. Each stall are always open and working properly. You may have to wit a while to vacuum out your vehicle.</Review>

<text>I would give this self hand car wash location a 5 star rating if the vacuum(s) worked at 100% but the hoses dont really suction the dirt/dust from inside the vehicle. Other than that, it's a pretty decent car wash 👍🏽</text><time>1557010469995</time>< resp>

You can wash your own car here and not have to worry if a machine cleaned your car right . And if you go here like @11 pm you can wash your car with three dollars, but it might me packed.< /Text>

(Translated by Google) Excessively expensive, to dollar the minute, and I did not want to use another carwash where they offered 5 minutes for 2 dollars, and here I came to pay 1 dollar per minute, and the bad thing that these machines have no way to return the coins, I never return more.

<Review>I worked with Kaleo at Classic Rock and it was nothing but a pleasure.  I came in early November with plans on surprising my now fiancee by proposing on our anniversary which is around Christmas time.  I also needed someone who would be willing to work with a center diamond that was already in the family.  Kaleo was super supportive and helped make this custom ring a real stunner.  I gave him pictures of rings from my fiancee's pintrest and he found the perfect one!<//Review>< Response>

<pictures>None</pictures><Text>Contacted Classic Rock to make a custom wedding ring after reading the great reviews. Very happy I did! I wanted it to be very personal for my fiance. The ring was absolutely beautiful! Jeanne takes her time with you and is very honest. Her staff was always in communication with me and very transparent throughout the process. The order was a rush and kudos to the Classic Rock staff and partners for making it happen!<//Text><Gmap_id>0x808fcc851f37d8d3:0x186337bb34d006b9< /Gmap_id>< Time>

<Text>We had such an amazing experience at Classic Rock shopping for our wedding bands.  They have an extensive selection and their entire staff is so friendly and genuinely cares.  They truly want to help you find exactly what you're looking for and take into account your budget.  I would highly recommend visiting Classic Rock for any of your jewelry/accessory needs.  I'm sure you will also have a great experience if you visit!</Text>< pictures>

I purchased new matching wedding bands in 14k white gold.  Classic Rock has a large selection of styles.  They are also make custom jewelry.   I had an earring made into a pendant.  It turned out exactly how I envisioned it so I'm very happy.<//Text>

Excellent service. Came here on two occasions, one to shop for an engagement ring and the second was for our wedding bands. The staff was very helpful and friendly. They took the effort to really understand our needs and we walked out happy. I highly recommend this place.<//Review>

It was exquisite and, just as important, ready when they said it was going to be ready. Jeanne and Aysel are just wonderful people who care about the things you care about. They take the time to get to know you and try to really understand what you want. They are honest, trustworthy and know their stuff.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

Jeanne and her staff were very kind and informative.  They helped me with any questions I had and worked hard to help me find the engagement ring I wanted.   I was very happy that they let me do it my way, answering my questions and being supportive without being pushy or trying to give me their "sales pitch".   I had a rough idea of what I wanted and what kind of information I needed, and at many other places I found it hard to get through the process in the driver's seat, so to speak.   Other places were always trying to sell me on a certain ring or a certain philosophy - Jeanne and her staff at The Classic Rock were far better at just being supportive and informative when I had questions, but more importantly also give me space take my time and think about my decision, and to look at the stones as I chose.   They also had a microscope setup that I used regularly which was very convenient (some other places don't have that).  Overall very informative, very honest and very helpful.  5 stars!!< /review>

Classic Rock always has beautiful pieces in a wide variety of styles and I can always find something I just know my wife will love. The staff is very patient and helpful and not at all pushy. And, they have great style taste so they can see the kind of things I'm considering and show me other pieces I might like even more. I have bought a number of pieces over the past several years and my wife has loved every single one of them. They are the best.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

Classic Rock has been amazing in helping my boyfriend and I to design our own engagement ring! From the first day we walked in, they welcomed us and were so kind and helpful. I worked with Shawn and she was so knowledgeable and patient as we worked though the design and creation process. Jeanne also helped me make the best decisions possible for the ring. And now I have my dream ring! Thank you so much, Classic Rock!</Review>

I had been looking for a watermelon tourmaline for several years. I came to classic rock and Jeanne found options for me to look at in two days!! Some of the most amazing combinations of colors I had ever seen, and I’ve been looking. The service was excellent, Jeanne and the crew kept in contact with me through out the whole process. Amazing place!<//Text>

Jeanne and her team were great.   She worked with my very limited knowledge of gemstones to guide me towards a perfect gift for my wife.    She was very open about pricing and what is a good value versus a waste of money.   I will definitely be going back since she instilled a great sense of trust with me during our conversation.</Text>

The team at Class Rock is fantastic.  Jeanne Katsuro's depth of knowledge sets her apart.  I love that along side the stunningly sophisticated top-of-the-line pieces, Classic Rock offers beautiful moderately-priced items, too.  Jeanne took as much time with me as if I were a high roller.  I may never be rolling in the dough, but I do know that I'll be using Classic Rock for all my jewelry needs in the future.< /Review>

I did most of my business with Jeanne over the phone and she was very helpful. When I went to pick up the ring in person, we looked over everything again and I got to see the diamond under the microscope. She pointed out any flaws upfront, and overall, was very easy work with.<//Review>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Review>My wife and I went to the Classic Rock to see what they offered in terms of wedding bands - we had just got married at the courthouse a week earlier and hadn't looked into rings yet. Our salesperson Kaleo was super helpful in providing a range of choices in terms of styles, sizes, and materials. He also priced out all the combinations we were interested in, and at no point did we feel pushed into anything beyond what we wanted to spend. We picked out bands that we're both stoked on, and the whole process was easy and enjoyable thanks to our wonderful salesperson and the rest of the staff at the Classic Rock.<//Review>< pics>

<Review>The help and service that I got from Jeanie was enough alone for a 5 star review...then factor in the quality and value of the jewels and I wish I could give 10.
I initially came in with my fiance a few months ago looking for engagement/wedding rings. The quality of the rings were great and very reasonably priced compared to the other stores we've been to.
Eventually we opted to get the setting at another store, but returned to Classic Rock because of the great service we got months before.
Jeanie not only gave me a great deal on a beautiful diamond, but taught me a bit about stones and helped me set up insurance on the ring.
I will definitely recommend Classic Rock to my family and friends.<//Review>< user>

I always learn so much from Jeannie and staff at Classic Rock.  I created a custom wedding band and engagement ring for my wife.  Making the right choice on jewelry can be very daunting, but the staff here is very knowledgeable and friendly.

Went with my fiancée to pick out rings, and couldn’t have been happier with the service and attention to detail.

Jeanne went above and beyond to help us with our  rush order, and even pointed us in the right direction for some local eats!

Will definitely be back and would recommend to anyone!</Review>

<time>1513384456673</time><Name>Roland Raga</Name><Text>After several months I am finally writing this review for this amazing establishment.  I came here, with my girlfiend, around July to attend the diamond class that they offer.  I literally knew nothing when it came to diamonds (they all sort of looked the same to me) but Shawn was very diligent in informing us about the basics of diamonds and how they are categorized.  She tailored the lesson as we went along to discuss topics that we had more interest in.  It really felt like a class!  We compared sizes, colors and clarity of diamonds and she brings out examples to compare, giving us a clearer picture of the topics she was explaining.  The class itself is very in depth and informative, it ultimately helped me make a choice for my purchase of an engagement ring.

I came back a few months later in September I emailed The Classic Rock and made an appointment to come in, hoping to get the process started on choosing an engagement ring within the one hour I had prior to work.  The staff is very welcoming and attentive to all of your ideas and requests, as well as your time constraints!  Ruth had brought up the information that was written down during the diamond class we took in July so it was easy to choose a round cut, but she helped me decide what diamond size range I wanted to go with.  After this visit they had ordered a few diamonds that fit the criteria we discussed within my one hour visit.

A few days later the diamonds arrive and I am again at the store deciding between carat weights of the selected diamonds that fit the criteria I chose.  It was such a simple process as Ruth, Shawn and Jeanne provide input on all the pro's and cons between the diamonds in terms of different aspects of the diamonds themselves.  I thought I'd have a little more stress in this choosing process but it was so simple coming here. I went with a 1.51 carat VS2 F clarity round cut!  I cannot stress how simple it was to get this process started and for them to work around my time constraints and take into consideration my budget.  My ring was basically done; my diamond was chosen, the band was chosen and I just had one last request.  I wanted to add a little detail to the band and requested to place a small sapphire stone on one side of the band so only she could see it.  Ruth took the request and made it happen!  She gave an example of the finished product while the ring was being put together and I was overly satisfied with the result.

Fast forward 4-6 weeks in October later and the ring was finished.  I pretended to go to the gym but I really picked up the ring!  Fast forward again to November at the Conservatory of Flowers in SF where I proposed to my girlfriend.  She said yes of course!  All thanks to The Classic Rock.  I still cannot believe how easy they made it for me to choose a ring.  I highly recommend this place to any guy looking to purchase an engagement ring.  I promise it isn't as scary as you'd think, as long as you come here!</Text><pictures>None</pictures>< userid>

Went to Classic Rock to have a couple rings resized--my anniversary band with diamonds, and also a tanzanite and diamond ring.  Jeanne and JoAnne were so helpful and friendly--always a joy to work with them.
I picked up my rings two weeks later.  I am very pleased with the results!
They also have a fine selection of fine jewelry.  Would highly recommend a trip to Classic Rock !< /text>

<review>I live over an hour away from San Jose, and decided to visit here while going there for an errand. I had been thinking about a single strain pearl necklace for my wife and had done some research online to see which direction i wanted to go.

Since my wife is not big into Jewelry, i wanted to be sure what i was getting and ensure it was done right. After discussion, there was an unstrung strand of Japanese Akiko pearls that were just what i had been envisioning.

They went into action calling goldsmith and were going to string themselves that night if he couldn't do it. Picked a clasp and picked up 2 days later which was Christmas Eve (was ready end of next day).

Excellent and Warm service, caring and knowledgeable staff and feel I got an exquisite piece that doesn't look like it came from ebay.

I had such a great experience, i'm planning on going back at end of next year for a diamond upgrade. Thanks!</review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

I went in yesterday for a perm. Mind you I was 30 minutes late, but they took me in instantly. From the start to finish Rhina was so cheerful and friendly. She gave me advise and opinions on my hair. I trusted her since she has been in this business for a whileee now. She was very patient (I have a lot, A LOT, of hair) and she took her time curling every strand of my hair. My experience was amazing. They are amazing, you just feel so welcomed here.</review>

<Review>Mary was an life saver! I came from LA and decided to get my hair done at Oasis. I’m no hair stylist but my hair was 4 or 5 different colors. I allowed her to attempt to fix it after 3 times I cancelled the payment. I was not paying for services that were not performed. I went in today and they completely transformed it in one visit. I’m very relieved to have found a person to truly repair the damage. My hair was in great shape an after one place with high stars all the work was for nothing. All the breakage and damage I’m happy to say that will not be happening again. Thank you Mary!<//Review>< pics>

I was new to hill top salon. I loved the customer service.  I got a nice cosmetologist Rhina she was very professional and my hair cut came out beautiful and the style too. I'll definitely be coming back here.< /text>

Service was horrible my hair is very light brown I just wanted blond highlights she dyed my hair a solid Platinum in the front and the back was patchy she made me look like a clown the day before my three-year-old granddaughters funeral it wasnt the owner it was the other lady and they don't wear a mask nor do they require you to wear a mask it was a little uncomfortable to say the least it was a horrible experience I'd never recommend this to anybody and the owner did offered to fix it for $400 they are just as crazy as I looked when I walked out of there</review>

<review>If i could give this place 10 stars I would. The women are friendly, talented, and sweet. I came in just knowing I wanted my hair as red as possible and Mary literally left me with exactly what I wanted. I couldn't keep from saying I loved it over and over. Worth the money(which isn't bad comparatively), worth the wait, and I will definitely be coming back!!!</review>< pictures>

<text>I messaged them here on Yelp very very late at night and was surprised to get an instant response. I was able to get an appointment on very short notice which worked out perfectly.

Once I arrived I was a little unsure how I felt, I didn't have to wait even a second before I was greeted. They were attentive even while working on another client and checked in while I waited to see if I needed anything. My stylist listened to what I wanted, made suggestions, and while talkative the conversation wasn't annoying or obnoxious as it is at some places.

After all was said and done I left satisfied but was offered the ability to return if any corrections were needed. I only had a simple cut but it's worth checking out if you're looking a little moppy.<//text><gmapID>0x80c35dc4d7e95553:0xd9e79ace57d2ed6a< /gmapID>< Response>

I have been looking for a salon that would make me feel at home that would do my hair to my liking and would give me advice if my selection of hair color or style was to far out and I have to say I found it . The owner was nice and pleasant, Maya my stylist did a great job and I love my hair I will definitely come again thanks ladies you guys are awesome.< /Review>

Best place to get haircut in the high desert, reasonable prices, great staff, and great environment. You’ll never leave unsatisfied unless you’re one of those picky people that are never satisfied with anything. Other than that definitely 5 stars.<//text>

Made a stop at Albertsons which is located in the Carson Depot shopping mall. There is a Home Depot, Staples and other business establishments there. The Albertsons has a stand alone cooler with sushi that is made fresh daily. While I don't care for sushi my girlfriend loves the stuff. And since we are still in the middle of COVID-19 and not going out much this is a great way for her to enjoy one of her favorite foods. It is fresh, flavorful and reasonable priced. If you love sushi you should check it out.< /review>

It was something that I don't regret, the staff was concerned and willing to help, and I was convinced that this establishment was still in business now even after Covid.< /review>

<text>Unlike most shopping centers this one really does have just about everything you need. Its main stores are Albertsons and Home Depot but it also has a bank, gas station, fast food restaurants etc. The best part is that all the locations order on the borders of the shopping mall which gives you a lot of parking I never really putting your car too far from anyone place.</text>< date>

Employees just hangout with each other like they're always on break. Asking them for help seems to bother them. There seems to be a party at the back of the store with 5 employees just hanging out while they watch 1 do all the stocking.<//Review>

Its a really great and friendly place. Plumbing racks are not the best everything is mixed up. The wood section is the best . Gardening side is beautiful, you have your own help counter, for the paint department.  Beautiful woman work there. Tool section is amazing love the quality of tools they have . Makita and Milwaukee being my most favorite.<//review>

<Rate>1< /Rate><text>I was due at a petsitting job and my phone's battery died on me leaving my GPS useless. I couldn't find the address and it was getting late. The charger in my car wasn't giving me enough to open my contacts. I remembered that Staples has computers, and I just needed 2 minutes to access my email. They close at 9pm. I got there at 8:56. Their doors were already locked.  I motioned to a clerk and the manager and gestured that I needed help. They just turned away ignoring me.<//text><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None<//response><gmapID>0x80dd35a20efd9b9b:0xf4ea600063fe0177<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

I understand certain things i dont have control of but it is a family store.  Just keep your party weekend stories for your lunch or breaks..< /Text>< pics>

Rented a truck for 75 minutes from here to pick up a washer machine.  This process was s breeze.  All I needed was my license, proof of insurance  and my credit card. I was charged $50 and then refunded $26 when I returned the truck. I did put about $3 worth of gas in, we didn't drive the truck very far and probably didn't need to put any in but I wasn't getting charged some absurd amount. The gentleman in the tool rental where I got the truck was great, he knew his stuff and was just very courteous.  He made sure i was good driving and set to go.  Renting the truck from Home Depot is super easy!< /review>

They have everything you need and if they don't have it you don't need it. Store is well maintained for the most part courteous and professional staff.

Although when I was checking out with one item I wanted to use the cashier while she directed me towards self check out I told her I did not know how to use the machine she abruptly scanned my one item at self-checkout and walked away quickly.< /review>

Although when I was checking out with one item I wanted to use the cashier while she directed me towards self check out I told her I did not know how to use the machine she abruptly scanned my one item at self-checkout and walked away quickly.<//Review>< Pictures>

All entrances into this shopping center are off center! You enter from Lomita Blvd and like 20 feet after entering, you have to stop for cross traffic because they don't have a stop. It should be the other way around. The shopping center has good stores. Home Depot, Staples and a supermarket that is very clean and quite large! There are fast food restaurants on the East corner and parking there is very tight and difficult! There's an awkwardly placed gas station and getting in and out of it is like a game of chicken. They need to redesign the parking lot to make stores more easily accessible. It's kind of a rat's maze< /review>

This home depot has everything you need. My kids like the paint samples, wood floor and carpet wedge to do arts and crafts. I like the weekend activities they do for kids and the plants for sale.< /text>

<review>This place is huge and Beautiful everything is well taken care of .. I only find that customer are always looking for help with a store employee and only to be waiting on a an employee who lacks knowledge of what i am  looking for! I ALWAYS either have to figure it  out what im looking for or be turned away from an employees who doesnt understand what i am looking for! Dont like going to a store to be turned away sorry Depot get more employees knowledgeable in what  you sell like   the products you carry!</review><rate>1< /rate>< pics>

Returned an appliance florescent light bulb I had  purchsed it was the wrong size ..The Customer Service Department  was very helpful the cashier called an employee from Lighting to assist ,myself  in finding the right type it took two seconds for him to find the right size I needed  it saved myself a lot of time ..I dont remember thier names but they were both very customer service orientated and very courteous and  sufficient which is not the norm now a days .T.Y....

(Translated by Google) There are very few ATMs and there is no one to help you find what you want and when you finally find someone they send you to the wrong place, in the Home Depot of Torrance they have more qualified personnel.
