Needed a last minute set and pedicure. They said they had time only because the older lady could do it. They should have mentioned that she was not very experienced. The nails were crooked and thick. Paint was so bad. It was cheaper than usual so I'm sure that was why.< /Text>

<Response>None</Response><Text>If you're looking for a new nail salon, this is the place you want. The ladies there do amazing work and are super fun to be around. Without being overly chatty, they're friendly and funny. I tried several different services there. It's obvious why they have so many loyal customers.

Nails: I didn't get my nails done, but I watched them work as I got my pedicure. Absolutely beautiful!

Pedicure: While I did miss the massage chairs at my old place, the amazing "mud" they used made up for it. I chose the milk (for dry skin) instead of the lavender mud. I am in love! I'm not used to soaking my feet in a bucket instead of a foot tub thing, but it was so cool. It was hard to sit still because my toes kept wanting to play with mud. They also had an insane variety of nail colors to choose from. The man also worked extra long on my very callused feet for no extra charge. They're so nice and soft/smooth now!

Brow wax: Fast and good. The only complaint I have is that the bits she missed with the wax were trimmed instead of plucked.

Leg wax: This wasn't on their list of services but they do it. I had a mixed experience with this one. She uses a wax that hardens and peels off (because it is gentler on the skin, causes less bumpiness, and doesn't leave the skin all sticky afterwards) but it didn't work for me. It could be because my skin is ridiculously dry, but it was pretty miserable as she slowly yanked bits of wax free. To be fair,  she said this usually doesn't happen. After probably 20-30 minutes of torture, she switched to the old style wax and it was quick and a LOT less painful. Next time, I'll ask for that kind from the start. I want to be clear, that woman tried amazingly hard to give me a great leg wax, and she delivered. I would have given up and switched waxes earlier, but she was determined to make it work for me because she knew I'd love the results.< /Text><date>1510266429100<//date><gmap_id>0x8085143644aab8e1:0x690dd67147293f44</gmap_id>< user_name>

Jus got back from a job interview got hired on the spot so I was feeling good wanted to treat myself. I hear such good things about this place and wanted to see firsthand. When I got there the two doors were closed. Pulled on it. Locked. Knocked. No answer. waited for 5 minutes til I jus said forget it. Very disappointed because I'm positive they saw me waiting there.<//text>

<text>Can you say, "Sanitary!"? This place uses individual deep baskets lined with disposable bags. Every kit is in a closed and processed autoclave bag. All sand files, sponges, buffers are tiny ones that are thrown away after your pedi. They put the foot scrub into tiny disposable "sauce-type" lidded containers so no "double-dipping" into a huge communal jar of scrub. All other products are dispensed out squirt bottles. The techs are gentle and do not aggressively go after or injure the sides of your big toe. Your feet NEVER touch anything that could hide germs or fungus! Brought Hubby for his first pedi. He loved it! We got the Crystal Mud pedi and my feet feel so soft and hydrated. Love this place & I'm coming back!< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None< /Response>< Gmap_id>

Family business. Great atmosphere, very inviting. Phong and Rose are really good at what they do. Phong can do almost ANYTHING to your nails! They don't have traditional pedicure tubs, which can breed fungus and other germs, that's what hooked me! Won't ever go back to the Mall! They do take walk ins but hunny....they are always busy! So make an appointment so you're not sitting around.  AND, Ask to sit in the massage chair!</Text>

Small little market need to upgrade and cut the tree that covers their name.  It's a good market for fast groceries shopping instead of going to big market and staying in line.. But they need to get fresh vegetables omg. Many times I went vegetables are old. ☹️</review>

<Review>Jamba is usually pretty solid. The weather today was in the triple digits, and my smoothie definitely hit the spot. They have done well during the pandemic, keeping everyone at a distance, while still providing excellent service. Super easy to use their online platform as well if you don't want to wait in line. I'll definitely be visiting again. 👍🏼<//Review>< Rate>

Great smoothies. Clean store. Lots of parking and right next to the canal trail for a quick stop in after a run or bike ride.</text>

<Text>The manager always seems to be on the move making sure the store is clean and it runs efficiently. He seems to really care about his job and his crew. Because of this the team always seems happy and always greats me with a smile when I walk in.

Not all Jamba Juices are created equal. I love this location. Why? One word: Erica. She’s amazing! Super warm and friendly. She took the time to create a fantastic fresh juice combo that tasted so damn incredible. Coming back here all the time!!!< /review>

<text>This location of Jamba Juice is clean and well kept. The workers are often respectful and extremely helpful. The workers were kind to tell me what the ingredients in the drinks I asked about. They made the smoothies in a reasonable time. I know it’s not exactly about this location, but the smoothies are truly delicious.</text><Pics>None<//Pics><response>{'time': 1538150279313, 'text': 'Bryce thanks for the great review!'}<//response><Gmap_id>0x808561004393a683:0xceedd6f8afbcec66</Gmap_id></record>

This place tries to be good for you but...isn't.  I ordered the amazing greens and it was NOT a juice drink, but some kind of smoothy...  not sure what the base is but I pooped GREEN for two days after drinking it. So nasty!</review>

< Review>
Jamba Juice must have recently revamped their menu, as the 12/16/32 ounce sizes have turned into small (8 oz), medium (12 oz), and large (24 oz), while raising their prices. A medium smoothie now costs upwards of $5-6! Anyway, the smoothies are good. Not healthy by any means, but people don't usually go here for the health aspect anyhow. My favorite is the Mango-a-Go-Go and Strawberries Wild. As pricey as they may be, they make a pretty tasty smoothie.< /Review>

< Review>
If I can give them 1/4 of a star I would. My children like the "peanut butter mood with extra peanut butter scoop" which they want to split in cups. For some unknown reasons, the staff  is CONSISTENTLY unable to get the order right.
They forget to put the extra scoop of peanut butter which I paid for, and then they don't split the smoothie in two cups as we asked for...And then when we asked politely to have it split in two cups, we get an attitude and some expression of exasperation with rolling eyes.
COME ON!!</Review>

The first thing I noticed when I walked into this Jamba Juice was how clean it was. It was 7 p.m. so perhaps the rush of daytime crowds had long passed - but still it was a couple hours before closing. The two guys working tonight were cleaning up but stopped to greet and help me. I was meeting a friend who had showed up first - I sat down at a (clean!) table with her and her boyfriend to look over some papers and happily reminisced about once upon a time sixteen years ago when I was the seventeen year old behind that juice counter.

I talked for a minute with Josh and Thomas before I left - they were really friendly employees. No music playing (perhaps there's a manager somewhere reading these reviews), and they actually seemed happy to be at work. I enjoyed my visit in here much more than the last time I was inside a Jamba Juice, and I left with a smile on my face!<//text>< Gmap_id>

Unable to fill out orders appropriately. This is a common occurrence!
The worst part is when they want to argue with you about your order.

The pharmacist was very welcoming and knowledgeable about all the medicine, especially that was good for my cough. I really liked the place and all of their staff.

My acquisition of a health product was incredible. I don't have any doubts about the item that I picked up. Since I have followed my balanced lifestyle, I have been strengthened by it. The best thing about this store was that they had pharmacists who were certified and could handle us easily. I highly recommend this place!< /review>

The food is delectable and almost flawlessly prepared. The team is also friendly and knowledgeable about their careers. This restaurant is perfect for fine dining. The interior design of the restaurant provides a comfortable and romantic atmosphere that is ideal for date nights, family get-togethers, and business meetings.<//text>

After waiting for over an hour to pick up my prescription at Rite Aid, I walked down the street and very quickly I was able to transfer over to Walgreens Pharmacy and soon after that my prescription was ready. I was so happy to be in and out with excellent customer service throughout the whole process. I am so glad that I switched over and even happier to know that they have free delivery for same day. How awesome is that!<//text>

Single handedly the best experience I've ever had in a pharmacy. (Sick as a child)
The store is brand new and immaculate, the pharmacists are warm and kind and they will get you what you need. I spoke with them whilst they prepared my prescription and I really felt like these people are in the medical field for the right reasons, to help people.
Lastly, and I honestly mean this, they are AFFORDABLE!- if anything reasonably priced. They're directly across from R******d.
Support a local business, have a genuine human interaction and get your medicine from someone who cares.<//Review>

The staff is amazing, I never seem to wait long, and it's always fun to do a little shopping while I wait!

Another reason why sometimes small, local businesses are the better option over big box stores!< /text>< Pictures>

was blown away by the level of customer service I received from Ellis, a pharmacist at Walgreens Pharmacy. I had been struggling with my insurance company for over a month to get a drug approved that was medically necessary. Long story short, even after I had the drug officially approved, Ellis literally could not fulfill the prescription. The computer system was still not allowing it to go through! Ellis took it upon himself to get to the bottom of the issue, spending an HOUR advocating for me on the phone with a number of people. In the end, I was able to walk out with my medication - and most importantly, medication covered by my insurance.</text>

<text>I like the peaceful and retro vibe of the store. It feels warm and friendly unlike a cold, sterile corporate behemoth like CVS.

Above all I really love the custom paper bags they use to pack your medicine and purchases in. It's all in the little details that show they go the extra mile to make your experience unique.

I've seen this pharmacy on the corner of a Ventura Blvd plaza for years and never thought to go in. Now I will never go elsewhere!</text>< pictures>

<Review>Tamir, Larry, and the entire Walgreens Pharmacy staff are true examples of the very best in customer service. My specialty prescriptions for my post-transplant drugs were sent here from the hospital, and wow..I can't believe how great they are. If I need something rushed, it will be delivered the next day, they try to get me discounts on other expensive medications I need to take. Every time I call, they ask how I am, and treat me with genuine concern, and are more like friends than a customer/retailer relationship.

Once you try West Knoll, you will never want to use any other pharmacy. Tamir and Larry...YOU ARE THE BEST!!!</Review>< pictures>

Never thought I'd be reviewing a pharmacy on Yelp but I have to give praise where it's due.

This is a small, vintage 1950s style pharmacy with everything you would need and some extra goods like makeup and small gifts.</review>

I used to get all my prescriptions filled at the pharmacy at Ralph's until one day Ralph's did not have the drugs to fill one.....in fact after waiting for Ralph's to get inventory, I was unable to fill it for 2 1/2 months!  SO, I called Maxons to see if they had stock....thankfully they did!  I first called the missing one in, and then proceeded to have EVERY prescription I could moved to them!</text>

<Review>Terrible pharmacy assistance. Apparently my subscription would be ready in 45min and when I do show up to pick it up they tell me that they have no record of me. I called to be able to see what the issue was and the pharmacist with quite a bit of attitude told me to just go back the next day.< /Review><Name>Valdini Estrada<//Name></record></dataset><record>

Awesome boat services with very reasonable prices. Lot of parking space on the pier.  For first 90 min it’s free after that also very reasonable prices and max $20 per day.  Very nice place, fresh air, nice beaches, boat ride starting at $5 per person.  Overall very good experience... we really enjoyed this place it’s totally worth going to Santa Barbara.<//Review>

Fantastic company. We had bad weather for the scheduled day of our cruise and the company offered a reschedule or a full refund in a very professional way. Will definitely be a return customer every time I'm in SB!<//Text>

Had so much fun on the whale watching cruise this past weekend. Finally got to see whales, blue and humpbacks. Booked two trips on consecutive days to make sure I saw whales and I did both times. Definitely recommend the experience!< /Review>

We really wanted a 4 hour cruise but those book up months in advance so we were happy to find this 1 hour cruise around the Harbor at the last minute.  It was perfect on our first day touring Santa Barbara.  Great Captain with history and tidbits about the coastline and homes.  The weather was gorgeous and couldn't have asked for a better last minute tour!  Not a party tour either-- which was super nice. Quiet and enjoyable.</review>

{'time': 1596039836680, 'text': "Bryan, thank you for the review. We currently have hand sanitizer in our kiosk location on the wharf, in both of the boat's restrooms and available inside the boat per request. We will begin making announcements during our safety talk where it is available so it is ensured everyone knows where it is. It is correct we do not have any areas designated for children, but all seats on our boat are deemed as safe for children per the United States Coast Guard. We're sorry that you don't feel this was a five star experience, but if you join us again, we hope that can change."}< /Resp>
<Name>Bryan Martinez< /Name><review>I enjoyed the mini cruise, however, there was no hand sanitizer anywhere nor a designated area for kids and by this a mean safe seat for kids. The view of the sunset was amazing and the drink are good.</review></record></dataset><record>

Very fun boating service that offers several different trips including Sunset Cruises, Whale Watching, and Private Charters. The Azure Seas has a very friendly crew, indoor seating, and a full bar! They also own the Lil Toot water taxi that's provides family friendly trips to the Harbor and back.</text>

We had a great experience and loved every minute. The SB harbor is beautiful, the waters were calm and the sea life was a fun bonus. Captain Quincy shared stories and answered our questions while we snacked and enjoyed a bottle of wine. Captain Quincy was awesome and proved to be a valiant hero in the end. The boat was perfect for our small group and super quiet. I would highly recommend this scenic tour for all.<//review>

I loved the idea of this. A romantic cruise with my honey. But the college party kids kinda ruined it for us. The cocktails were SUPER weak and the appetizers ran out within the first 5 minutes. The views were great tho.< /Review>

<review>Terrific experience with Captain Taylor, Kathy, and crew on the Azure Seas at sunset.  Mom and Dad in town from out of state and we wanted to get out on the water.  Last-minute booking complications and weather almost shut us down but Kathy was most accommodating and called us right before the cruise to let us know the fog had cleared and we had a beautiful evening on the water.  Terrific boat and great people, highly recommended!</review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

I took my four kids and my wife, we got there at 330 pm and were told that next available boat ride was at 415 pm so we got the tickets and pasiently waither there, when the time came to get on the boat we were the last in line so by the time it was our turn the boat was full so we were told that we could not get on the boat untill 515 pm because some how they over sold the tickets, that ment to wait another hour with four kids that are crying because they were on the boat and had to get off.<//Text>

If it wasn't for the awesome staff I'd give one star. Didn't see one dolphin or whale. Understandable but no coupon for return date or anything. Made joke out of it. Have gone on numerous trips with another company and always saw atleast pod of dolphins. Doubt we'll try again.< /Review>

(Translated by Google) It is a good experience, the boat is big, try to stay at the rear of the boat on the 3rd floor, less wind, sitting and the very good comfort of chairs.

(Original)
É uma boa experiência , o barco e grande , procure ficar na parte traseira do barco no 3 andar, menos vento , sentado e o conforto muito bom de cadeiras.</Review>

< Review>
I had a very nice late lunch at Kreation in their outdoor COVID patio seating. Pleasant enough except for the traffic noise. Staff was courteous and nice. Food was tasty, healthy and fresh. It is a little pricey in general, but certainly not for the neighborhood. The portions are generous and the food did not disappoint. I will be back to try more menu items. The Brooklyn Hipster Avocado Toast was quite good!<//Review>

All of the prices are mostly in the $12 to 17 range, the portions are large. I had the smoked salmon Benedict, which had decent salmon over a bed of spinach on top of toasted bread. Topped off with well poached eggs and hollandaise. There was a side salad. Open all day.<//text></record></dataset><record>

<rating>5< /rating><Review>I'm usually a smoothie gal, but the Amazebowl menu sounded so good I couldn't resist trying. The Jungle bowl was delicious - filling but light, with a solid amount of toppings. Plenty of healthy vegan options for breakfast and lunch. Unfortunately the indoor and outdoor dining areas were closed, but the setup is a cool boho-chic vibe.</Review>< Pics>

Service has gone downhill at this place. This is my place to go for brunch and breakfast because I live In the neighborhood and I have been really disappointed in the service! Went here twice this week and I think I’m gonna have to find a new place to go to!  Today I went there and I waited 30 minutes on my dinner, I finally had to cancel it and he still brought me the check with the food included that I didn’t even receive! Terrible! Never again!</Text>

This place was so good. Everybody order different things at our table. I couldn’t stop looking at the turkey chili, even though it was nine in the morning.  I had to order it, I did order it, and it was my perfect choice for breakfast!

Yanet was our waitress and I struck up quite a conversation with Thomas that worked there.

They both were great but I was very grateful that Thomas was so patient because I’ve probably asked him 37 questions.

I love that place, I love the atmosphere, the food was amazing, and all the plant life with the succulents on the walls were beautiful.

I WOULD RECOMMEND.< /Review><Date>1576621156771</Date>< Response>

<text>Wonderful wonderful persons that helped me during a really distressful day.
I had nowhere to go to charge my phone. My battery was dying. I had no Uber or Lyft. I had a really bad leg injury after being assaulted.
This wonderful male was SOO kind to myself not too long ago.
He let me sit outside and charge my phone as I was in a very distressed situation.
Wonderful persons.
The drinks are AMAZING.
A bit costly but still made me feel better when they were on Abbot Kinney.< /text>< pictures>

But if you're willing to pay them, these juices rock. For the juice purist, 50 Shades of Green is the grand king of all juices. It literally feels like you're drinking.... EARTH. All of earth All that is great in the world.

The rest of the juices are great too and what's nice about Kreation is that they usually have a ton of juices available to taste.

And for this spot in particular, it is one of their full restaurant spots and the food is very solid. Highly recommend!</Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMtapksjnCYg-lgIhrPGyxwIHBBo4jtL8VZ_VIq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNcXUW_L7iosqO5mPEmy9YzfYU-L46nBB1CYJM6=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures>< Response>

Come here if you want hot milk and no espresso in your $5 latte. Come here if you want your carrot cake to be tossed at you rudely. Come here if you want to remind your server to get you a fork. Come here if you want to remind the baristas to bring you the check.</review>

Given Covid Era. This place is really trying to meet all codes and safety regulations.  Setting up a larger eating place outside is is great. Salads and juices are always delicious.  Today I tried a chicken sandwich and I have to say it was very disappointing.  In my opinion,  this bread is not the right choice for this sandwich.  ( too thick) I hope they change it.< /Review>

<review>Food is good, service is something to be desired. You always feel healthy coming here and meeting your dietary restrictions. The relaxing lounge vibe and music is great. This is my favorite location. I've come a few times and the service is slow. They are not under staffed. The servers are cold and do the bare minimum. Once it took 20mins to be acknowledged at our table so we walked out. The staff were just standing around and talking. The restaurant was not busy today. Our food (meat) was cold. It took a long time so it probably sat there awhile. Our latte took 10mins and was also cold and flat. The coffee tasted horrible and we sent it back. For someone who Roasts their own private label you would expect better quality or a better barista. I love the setup, concept, and respect the quality ingredients and preparations, but they need a new manager and to retrain the staff. You would think a healthy place would have warm, friendly, inviting people.< /review>< Pics>

We left with run flats for a great price. We will continue bringing our vehicle here for further service. Great prices. No rip offs. He will inspect and ask questions to your vehicle before quoting you. No wonder the reviews are high.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

<text>Very good place to take your beloved ride.
I toke my volvo 1999 v70 GLT for both front axles replacement and they did a good job,  Robert toke care of me as professional at first was some problems with the new parts but was a problem from the  manufacturer that the axles came defective and he toke my old ones and did a rebuild on them and reinstalled back and now my car is running smoothly again on the road thanks to Robert and his teammates.
The price was reasonable and fair and also he did a discount on top of that.
Thanks Robert for all your help.
I totally recommend.

<time>1608056296693<//time><Review>This place is so great!  I happened to pull in here because I had a flat and I’m glad I did.  They found a crack in my rim that had been leading to a very slow, but very annoying leak that I didn’t even know I had for years!  They even helped me find a scratched second hand rim that was a lot cheaper then getting one new.  I ended up paying half I was expecting.  I’ve come back twice now for other things and they’ve always been very fast and attentive and if they’re busy they’ve been upfront with how long I will have to wait.

Also very friendly, would definitely recommend!< /Review></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
Came in after my tire pressure kept dropping. They checked to see if the issue could be patched instead of replacing the entire tire. It was just a nail and all that was needed was a patch! The fact that they didn’t try and push for a new tire and saved me money was incredible. Amazing service!!!</Review>

<Review>I had a screw in my tire, so it was holding air but I needed to fix it quick. 2 other tire shops in Hollywood were “too busy”! This place was awesome, and they plugged the hole in record time. I would definitely recommend them!</Review><user_id>117391535797649759622</user_id><Rate>5</Rate><Pictures>None< /Pictures><name>Aiden Tyler</name>< gmap_id>

They are a very decent shop, I toke my 1999 volvo v70 GLT for a vaccum hose repair and they were very fair on the price and very honest on the diagnostics,  I totally recommend them.</Review>

They sell good used tires. No guarantee on used tires. Service was fast. I would recommend Santa Tire Depot. I don't know what their prices on new tires are.</Review>

This is a really bad place, I don't recommend this place to anyone  they have lacy people to work  you have to wait for service  until they  want to do the  job don't respect the order to arrive in the place  if you are first they  attend another costumer and  just  lived you car. I was there for almost  one hour  just for check one tired. I ask to check all my tires  and oil change  l left the place because for this service  maybe take me  the complete day.< /review>

If you need a tire this guys are great, 0 waiting time everytime, I have been to every tire store where they sell you the valves ,the insurance ,the air ,the balancing ,if you need tires you should go to these guys and you'll be out of there like in 5 minutes like a pit stop real fast even though they dont look big ,their service its great, everytime<//review>

<text>The service was phenomenal! They texted a website link with detailed information on my vehicle with clear photos and video of the items that needed work. The estimate was itemized and clear. Of course, the most important thing is the excellent quality of the work done. They completed a considerable amount of repairs (rear differential and brakes) on my vehicle in less than 48 hours. I highly recommend ABC Auto Care!</text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None<//response><gmap_id>0x80e84d5711b6a689:0x6d8a2f3905976af7</gmap_id></record>

Took my classic 1992 Pontiac Trans Am Convertible to ABC, because Lee's shop came recommended to me.  My car had just failed a recent smog test and needed to be fixed in order to pass, allowing me to register the car.   I was concerned because this car is 29 years old and not all mechanic's understand or have much experience with older vehicles. Lee's technicians were able to  properly diagnose the issue and repair the car.  While it was there, I also had them fix two minor leaks that the car had.  My experience with this shop and it's staff was very professional.  They sent me photo's of my issues and provided quotes to repair. No surprises!  This shop is run the way Auto Repair shops should be run!
Kudo's to Lee and his staff!  I highly recommend ABC Auto Care, without reservation!  As Arnold Schwarzenegger once said... "I'll be back!"

<Review>After two years towing for AAA, I noticed how happy and satisfied customers were with this shop. So when it came to my personal vehicle I new I had to make an appointment. I was not disappointed, and now I am a happy client. Just the professionalism, excellent customer service, and quality of workmanship. I know when I leave the facility I have no worries. From the owner,  service writers, mechanics, they are up front and care about your vehicle. Go see Anders and all the crew and you will not be disappointed.  Highly recommend!< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

Was super hesitant at first since I’ve gone to the same dealership to get my car worked on since 2017 and this was my first time going somewhere new since moving to the area this year. But the transition went smoothly! Guys in the office were able to quote me on everything before working on my car and answered all my questions. I was waiting in lobby thinking it would be super quick but one of the guys upfront was kind enough to let me know they have a shuttling option and could take me home and pick me up which I was unaware of. Overall everybody seemed very friendly, was very welcoming, I appreciated the communication, and my car is running great 👍< /review>

I was referred by a coworker so I decided to give them a try. They were very professional and did what they quoted without increasing their prices. In fact they did a few more minor items that were not on the list  and went the extra mile for great customer service. I will bring my other work vehicles there in the future!< /review>

This was my first time taking my vehicle to this business. The inspection reports are great and the staff is friendly. I brought my car in for a general inspection and to have a few issues addressed. Besides getting an oil change and having the cabin air filters replaced, I decided to have the serpentine belt replaced too. However, within a minute of leaving the shop the new serpentine belt came off and I lost power steering while trying to make a right turn onto Telephone Road, which was pretty terrifying, but I managed to safely arc the car into a subway driveway. I called ABC immediately and the service rep and mechanic arrived within minutes. The repair needed to happen back at the shop so they gave me a loaner vehicle to take for the night. The next day they called in the morning and notified me they tested the car to make sure it was good this time. They even offered to wash it and bring it to my house for me to swap out with the loaner vehicle. However, when the car arrived at my house it wasn't washed and their was a dirty rag left in the vehicle. After the incident that happened the day before where I could have been seriously injured, the least they could have done was follow through with their offer to wash the car and make sure they removed the trash they left inside the car.</Text>

Everyone was very courteous, professional and efficient. They were able to get my car repaired on a friday without much notice, as I had tried to call many places prior and no one was able to fit me in. The online reviews speak for themselves, I would happily take any of my cars there for repairs in the future</Text>

Hugo was so professional and so knowledgeable. He explained what was happening with my car and it was not what I thought. Instead of just replacing what I asked for he explained what the car needed and we went with his recommendation. The cost of fixing the problem was really a few hundred dollars cheaper than what I had asked for. I will return for all my cars needs. I was extremely impressed. Thank you ABC.< /Text>

I had good vibes when I stepped in - Friendly and Professional, they are transparent, upfront about estimates, and kept me informed on a timely basis. I left my car over night and felt a sense of relief knowing that my car was in good hands. I am new to the area and so happy I found a place to take my Fiat 500 Sport for all my maintenance needs and repairs. Moreover, ABC Auto had MANY wonderful reviews and referrals from the Nextdoor app which was encouraging to me and why I chose ABC Auto!<//text>

Even when they weren’t able to fix a problem, they were up front about it, did not charge for the attempted repairs, provided a free loner vehicle throughout the process, and provided a detailed report to provide to the next shop I took the vehicle to. 5/5 stars, would recommend to anyone!< /Text><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

Had the car towed there and waited for an estimate on service's needed. They were very nice and accommodating. Well after receiving the estimate for repairs I have to say I was quite shocked at the cost. I decided to make a couple of calls and found their price to be very high. I took the car for a second opinion. The second opinion was quite different as in I didn't need ANY of the repairs presented to me. I saved $1500.00.

BMW M4 saved by ABC Auto Care after lazy diagnosis from BMW dealership!

First off, 100% recommendation. Easily the best service I've received when it comes to diagnosis/repairs. Upfront, honest and will find the root cause of the issue.

I have a 2015 BMW M4 that had a rough idle and low coolant. Originally I brought it into a BMW dealership in Camarillo. They ran a vacuum leak test and they said it was all good (it was not all good...coolant was low, obvious leak somewhere) After questioning and paying the BMW dealership a crazy amount of money for nothing I brought my vehicle to ABC auto care for a second opinion.

They diagnosed deeper than the initial vacuum test, and found an internal leak in the intercooler. This is a huge issue, but difficult to notice for an average dude like me. No check engine light, just a rougher idle then normal and physically low coolant in top intercooler tank. If I waited longer and trusted the BMW dealership diagnosis, my engine would be toast.

Anders from ABC Auto Care made sure everything was taken care of, great communication and up front about the severity of the issue (including pictures and price quotes before moving forward on installs/labor). If I got this work done at the dealership, it would have been a 5k+ ordeal easily. ABC saved me a ton of money in this category. Loaner car for free (first come first serve). Took less then a week to obtain parts, clean, install etc. To top it all off Anders went out of his way to find an extended warranty that pertains to this issue, potentially saving me more money.

My M4 now runs like the day I bought it, smooth and back to normal power. If you are contemplating bringing a higher end car in, have zero worries. A+++ in all categories</Text>

I've been taking my cars to the dealer in Camarillo for the past 17 years because it was convenient by being close to where I worked. Camarillo is now out of the way now that I'm retired. My car was nearing the 20,000 mile service and I thought I'd give a shop that's closer to where I live my business. I found ABC Auto Care on the web by using a site that recommended shops that repair and maintain BMW.
The invoice is a little different from the dealer by not performing a "standard scope" check, otherwise the professionalism and quality is the same as the dealer.<//Text>

<Review>The best car service I’ve experienced in years!  They explained everything, gave an honest and very fair estimate, loaned me a car to drive for free while my car was in their shop 4 days, and the finished price was actually even less than the estimate!  It’s not often that you leave a car shop paying less than expected. They washed my car after they finished fixing it. I’m so glad I found ABC Auto Care!</Review>< Response>

We had our radiator replaced and an oil change. Had to return for overfilled oil, washer fluid pump disconnected and other items not reconnected after service. Returned for oil leak and had main seal replaced. Leak still not fixed and they suggested another $800.00 in repairs. On top of all that they dented the door frames of my truck when they put it on the lift. We have called them many times to fix this and don't get calls back. I wouldn't trust them with any of our vehicles again.</review>

<Review>I live about 30 miles away but was so impressed with comments about their service I decided to take my car to them. I needed an oil change. The inspected my car, changed the oil and related services and rotated my tires. They noticed some "cupping" on the tires and suggested that we watch the tires to see if I would need an alignment in the future. The service was prompt, professional and courteous. I will return for other service when necessary.<//Review><resp>None</resp><UserId.>109357648210564528707<//UserId.>< Pictures>

After having taken my car to another local mechanic to get a new alternator and having to take back multiple times due to a faulty alternator, and technician not knowing what’s wrong with my car, I wanted a second opinion. ABC was very friendly, knowledgeable, and professional and fixed the problem right away. Will definitely be bringing my car back</text>

I was beyond thrilled with not only the quality of service but the professionalism of their business. Every time I called to check in with them they were so kind and knew exactly what they were talking about and how to answer my questions. They were exceptionally good at being timely with the repairs. I also finally have my car working 100% again just like before my car had gotten damaged on the freeway. I am beyond happy with ABC and highly highly recommend them!!</Text>

<text>I love these guys and have been taking my ‘12 Subaru Outback there for service since I got it. They are family owned, local, honest, courteous, timely and offer shuttle to/from.

There is a system to keep you on top of timely maintenance with email and text reminders. You can also book appointments with this system so nothing falls through the cracks.

They keep you updated if there are any issues and are just wonderful people. I highly recommend them!<//text>< Name>

This is the BEST shop in Ventura. I take both of my cars here so they work on many different makes and models. I’m so glad I found them. I really trust these people because they are honest and reasonable. They even went above and beyond and called the dealer for me to discuss some recall repairs. I’ve found the only place I’m taking my car!<//review>

Great people, Hugo is wonderful, looks out for his clients. Found him when Honda dealership tried to rip me of on $$ tires bought from them
Wasn’t even a client then at ABC, Hugo reviewed what Honda dealership said, looked at my tire, explained everything to me and wrote report that I took back to dealership and got my problems solved
Have been using ABC since 2017, won’t use anyone else</text>

<review>I just moved to the area and needed a new mechanic because my service engine light came on , I was sure that it was a sensor going bad I did not want to go to a dealer because they are more expensive so I chose ABC repair because of they had  5 star . The place is clean , professional and employees are very nice but when I dropped the car the diagnostic was all about service needed nothing about the issue with the service light on and after asking they confirmed that a sensor was bad I had them change it they charged me for the part 1 hour labor and $144 diagnostic since I let them do the repair I did not expect to pay for the diagnosis
I will most probably not return there<//review><user_id>115895686659983825365</user_id><Rate>3<//Rate></record></dataset><record>

They were AWESOME. My wife and I chose them specifically because they had a couple of 1 star reviews and the owner responded and rectified those. OUR car is now at Alexander GMC in Oxnard. They were the ones who replaced the water pump, so THEY need to make it right. Thanks for everything ABC!</Text>

Hugo did an amazing job of figuring out a bug in BMW testing software.

My battery, which was 2.5 years old, tested passing by Interstate, AAA as well as ABC.

Turns out changing to a new Bosch battery solved the problem of my battery drain.

Much cheaper than potential sensors, guesses as to connection problems or replace alternator read on the test.

I would have replaced working expensive parts for no reason.

If you have a Bimmer and a battery drain, buy a new Bosch before doing anything.

Thanks to Hugo and the Tech's for getting  the job done right!< /text>

When I moved down here and bought a new car I knew I needed to find a good mechanic to help maintain it, but it seemed like every where I went was rather shady and or overpriced. Then I found ABC, gave me a good price and made me feel like i was back at my hometown mechanic. Awesome staff and an overall amazing experience. Will definitely use them in the future< /review>

<Text>Either the mechanic tried to scam me, or doesn't know anything about rear differentials.

My wife's explorer had a metallic grinding sound coming from the back tire. We took her car to ABC Auto Care, where they said that the entire rear differential needed to be replaced, for just under $3k.

I am by no means an auto expert, but knew that my wife's car had independent rear suspension, so if there is a problem on one side, they only need to do work on the problem side, not both. Their quote for only working the problem side was $400 less.

I didn't feel comfortable with the quote, so I took the car somewhere else for a second opinion (Coastal Differential Repair). Turns out, the sound was because the lining of the emergency brake on the right side had worn completely off, and the spring had broken off into the rotor, which was causing the sound. I asked the mechanic if there was anything wrong with the rear differential, he said it just needed to be serviced. He did everything for under $320.

So, not only would ABC Auto Care have done unnecessary work, but they also wouldn't have fixed the actual problem. At least they only cost me $70 for a "diagnostic fee."

Update: I did have a good talk with the owner. He refunded my $70 for diagnostic fee, and seems genuinely upset at my experience.< /Text><Rate>1<//Rate>< Gmap_id>

<resp>{'time': 1576009655186, 'text': "Hello Ben,\nWhen I became aware of the review, I decided to ask my team what they could have done better to keep us away from being  this position. The things we came away with are here: We did not remove the rear wheels for inspection, we should have! In addition to the paid inspection, we didn't do our regular courtesy inspection, we should have! Had we done these things as we are supposed to do, we would have more than likely found the source of the problem. When we didn't, we shouldn't have put together a quote on something we weren't sure was the cure. Thanks to your review, I had a heart to heart talk with each employee involved in the process that resulted in the review. It wasn't pretty. My hope is that as a result of addressing these flaws, we'll be a better shop.\nAs for the $70.00 you spent on a flawed inspection, I've sent you a full refund today. I believe you deserve that money back. So, thank you for your review, I don't like it! but I'm going to use it to make the improvements we need to grow.

ABC Auto Care is Fantastic, Friendly, and Thorough.  I'd highly recommend using ABC Auto Care for you vehicle needs.  Seriously, stop by and you'll see how clean and professional they are.  Every time I've spoken with Lee or Lisa (owners) they dropped what they are doing and have always treated me with respect.  They are super sweet people themselves and the great experience doesn't stop there.  Their employees like Mondo and the rest of the shop have always been delight as well.

<review>Issacs is such a wonderful person. As a lady, I'm always so nervous about getting quoted for the fear of being taken price advantage of. So because I have to call multiple places for my dad (who is on a fixed income) its such a hard experience because I'm not sure if my dad will be able afford the service. Thus, I had to quote multiple places in Ventura to find the most affordable places. Issacs called me as soon as the shop opened and gave me an amazing price. I won't say the exact price of ABC or their competitors, but ABC was $30 cheaper in labor than the second most affordable place. I asked him if it was okay for me to check with my dad. Most other shops were trying to talk to me into coming right then. I couldn't. It wasn't my car. But Issacs was so not a pushy sales person. He got me in at the time and date that fit both our schedule. He made sure my appointment was confirmed.</review>< date>

<review>It was purely by accident that I initially decided to visit ABC Auto Care back in 1994 and it turned out to be the best decision I could have made.  Having a very trustworthy well-established business handling my auto maintenance is of the utmost importance to me.  I have found that proper and timely maintenance is key to minimizing the overall cost of ownership of a vehicle.  ABC helps me achieve that as well as assisting me in understanding the many options and decisions involved with keeping a vehicle in top and safe condition.</review>< Pictures>

<text>I needed help getting my truck the TLC it required. Front end performance issus can be a headache to deal with, not to mention the cost. I did some research and ABC Auto Care had a lot of positive reviews. Well, I was not dissappointed. I worked with Hugo and he provided the best course of action, based on findings from inspection. Very professional and he had responses for all my concerns. Oh, the free loaner vehicle was a plus. It was just 1 less thing to worry about. I found a new spot to take my vehicles for service and I highly reccommend this place.

Update - Another service visit and I am just as happy. It's comforting to know my vehicle is in good hands. Isaac communicated thoroughly and and again, very professional. I will continue my rating at 5 stars.< /text>< Pics>

<Text>I haven't been to all of the county's auto care businesses, but I  discovered GOLD when it comes to ABC Auto Care.  No reason to go anywhere else.  Ever.  This is a real family run, family involved business.  Appointments are made to accommodate the customer, and many of us come from "afar" to take advantage of their services.  Their prices are competitive and  going to the shop is almost like visiting their home.  Candy or pocket calendars?  Take your pick ... :`>  The welcome is warm and we customers feel appreciated.  Do yourselves a favor, and the next time your car needs TLC, try ABC!<//Text>< pics>

This is the best car repair place in town hands down. They made me feel so welcomed and comfortable. Hugo was the first to help me and amazing. They were so quick and at a very decent price. They even offered to pick me up after they were finished with my car. Gave me a full assessment on my car for free with recommendation on ways to improve the quality of my car. I will definitely be coming back here. Thank you to all the members at ABC Auto Care!<//text>

I was indeed very fortunate when I connected with the crew at ABC autocare. From the start I found everyone I spoke to polite and knowledgeable. They valued my time and gave me an accurate and quick estimate as to problem and repair time and approximate cost. It was also important to me they offered a loaner car for me to use free of cost. I definitely recommend the automotive care and their business to my friends and associates.</Review>

ABC Auto does a great job telling you what's most important to fix on your car. The quotes are fair and if you only have a certain amount of money they will tell you what is most important to fix. Would recommend to a friend.</review>

ABC Auto is awesome! They did the work I needed on my car same day at a rate no one else could possibly beat! Which means a lot especially for a single mom. The work quality is outstanding and there were no games or hiked up rates likes you'll find at other shops. Bob worked on my car, he is extremely knowledgeable and fixed a long standing problem two other shops couldn't resolve. I can finally trust that my car is safe for my children and that peace of mind is priceless. The office staff were also great, very nice and efficient. It is the only shop I will take my car to and I know that I will be treated fairly, with respect and the work will be quality.</Text>

{'time': 1474923233239, 'text': "Hello Brad.\nThank you for the review. However, we pride ourselves in finding all the things needed to be found on a vehicle and I'm hoping you may reconsider some of your comments. When you brought the vehicle to us, it was a very specific thing you had us look for.  It was a noise in the front that had you stumped as you mentioned you do most of the work on your own vehicle. If you look at the copy of the inspection report (of which we gave you a copy at the time of paying) you will notice that we did find the vehicle suspension needed other work. We mentioned shocks worn out and leaking, steering off center,  ball joints and control arm bushings worn. Under immediate attention we commented the brake system was due for service. As you can see, we feel we did a thorough job in the inspection plus we did fixed the noise issue which had escaped you. We use an electronic service to document all the findings on vehicles and once closed, we can not change the results. You can look at it on line but I don't want to post the link as other people may look at the information. Please call me and I'll be glad to email you a link.\nOnce again, thank you sincerely,\nLee Lizarraga\nABC Auto Care, President"}</Response>
<review>The people that work there are very friendly and their prices are competitive, however I went in to get an inspection and they failed to find several basic issues which I was already aware of (parking brake doesn't even work, lower ball joints are bad, brakes needed servicing). These are important aspects but on the final report these were all listed as fine.

Perhaps the mechanics were really busy that day or something. Recommend them if you already know what you need fixed but just be weary that you could have more issues than they found.<//review>< user_name>

I brought my Sebring in for an alternator and battery. I brought my own alternator, and they had no problem installing it for me. The service was excellent and fast. I was in and out in a day. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The price was a little high, but this is a higher income area. And the Sebring is a beast to work on. Thank you very much for getting the car up and running. If I wasn't moving out of state, I would use their service again.<//Review>

<review>ABC Auto Care is a most outstanding place to service your vehicle in Oxnard/Ventura! Every time I return it's a pleasant experience! They are highly knowledgeable, integral and extremely helpful and their prices are more than fair! Isaac helped me today with a pesky check engine light issue and solved the problem quickly and easily! He was sooo helpful!

ABC's Team are just fantastic. Not only that they are very symphatic and extremely friendly, they also took their time to discuss the issue of our van on the phone and squeezed us in immediately to have a look at the problem of our (a day before not but then suddenly again working) fuel pump.

We drove over and the mechanics had a look, but as the issue had been vanished, they even didn't charge one dollar, it was just for free.
So thank you again, you are great!< /Text>

I live in Camarillo but its worth the drive to Ventura to have this level of service, whether it be for an oil change, or something bigger like transmission repair.

OMG!!!!! Lee and my fave mechanic BOB R. I cannot tell you how far these guys will go to make you happy. They will even feed you. What? Yes! I got a bowl of carnitas one day. Now that's what I call customer service/care. LOL. I can't remember my other buddy's name (sorry), but I give them all 5 stars. Too bad I just moved back to Santa Barbara and it is a bit difficult to go to Ventura for every service. I will miss their prices too. They are super affordable. I definitely will recommend them to my Ventura/Oxnard folks.  Thanks for servicing my VW CC (Elke). She is very happy.< /Review>

I've been taking Mikey (my car) to ABC Auto Care for about 2 years & they always go above & beyond to take care of Mikey. The stress of car maintenance is always heavy on a single mom & they truly cater to making your life easier during the transition. DT refers good, honest business... And that they are!

We found ABC Auto Care through a referral from a friend of mine. We needed help to reprogram a computer that we did not have the tool for. I called and was put thru to Lee ( the owner ) who was helpful as could be. He told me to come over right away and when I got there I was impressed. The shop is clean and well staffed with nice professional people. They took care of me like I was family. Being the owner of a great shop I know quality when I see it and if thats what you are looking for then look no further than ABC Auto Care.

Wine Gallery has great food and a great wine/beer selection. We were staying nearby and could not get enough of their food. We have gone 5-6 times and it has been a great experience every single time. We will be back!</Text>

Great food. Love the different selections especially the wide range of veggies. Eating my veggies makes me feel less guilty about drinking their great wine. Doing takeout since COVID hit and they do an awesome job too.

These folks appreciate your business and LOVE their guests.<//Text>

We had gotten good reviews on this place from people we know. Upon arrival the greeter was pleasant we were waited on by Tyler who did a fantastic job. The food was very flavorful but not bountiful by any means expect to pay high prices for small servings. The wine selection was bountiful and presented well.<//Text>

<review>I just want to thank Wine Gallery for handling pandemic service so well. I felt safe picking up my order - clearly marked socially distanced lines, enforcement of mask requirement, regular cleaning or counter, and friendly service. It was our first take home in 7 weeks. We chose our favorite pizza!</review><gmap_id>0x80dce5a635aa4cc7:0x25e095932fdb7451<//gmap_id>< user_id>

Phenomenal! Skip the snooty inside where everyone just wants to be seen, and sit outside in the renovated alley. Cozy private nook with incredible food and friendly personable staff. Literally, a perfect evening.</Review>

<Text>There's a lot to like about this place - mostly that it has that old school east coast Italian restaurant charm. It's not hip and not trying to be. There are no wood paneled walls. The menu doesn't consist of 4 small pasta dishes for $22 that leave you hungry.<//Text><user_id>106025791351548226640<//user_id><gmapID>0x80dce5a635aa4cc7:0x25e095932fdb7451</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

The owner was so cool this place is amazing!  Kid friendly patio with wood fired pizza and great atmosphere. Drove up from San Diego and found this little gem. So glad we did!</review>

POTATO AND GARLIC AND PESTO PIZZA. Get it by the slice or get a whole pie. Staff is friendly, prices are $, pizza is fresh, and the decor/music fits just right with the NYC/Haight vibe. Do yourself a favor and get a slice of the potato pizza. It will make your day.</review>

Wine Gallery has some amazing Italian food. Their lunch menu mostly consists of pasta dishes (and avocado toast), but each of them is so good that it doesn't matter.

The gnocchi I got had the right amount of chewiness to it, and each one was big - I'm sure they were homemade. The meat-stuffed pasta my wife got was excellent too. Wine Gallery< /Text>

<Review>Awesome place for wine. It's a little small, but the ambiance is great and they have a lot of great wines to choose from! It's definitely worth trying out if you are around Polk! They have a great happy hour! It's usually crowded, so call ahead or plan for a wait!< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

Please don’t go there if you don’t have a coronavirus immunity. They weren’t following the cdc guideliness. There was no temp check, no hand sanitizer anywhere, they weren’t wearing mask properly in the kitchen and bar area.<//text>

< Review>
The wait-staff were amazing and service was superb.  We ordered cheaply and they still treated us as if we were of the high-paying variety. The wine selection is top-notch and food is scratch-made and delicious. As we received our bill, they brought us out a hot brownie a la mode on the house, not knowing it was our anniversary. Very nice touch. We will be back!</Review>

3rd time here and it's both different and better each time.  Food choices are delectable and well portioned. Wine selection is extensive both by the glass and by the bottle. Service is always on point.  Music is mellow.  Not super loud. Nice ambience.  Wish I lived closer but worth the 30 to 45 minute drive to get here.<//review>

< Review>
Great food and exactly the right vibe for Laguna Beach. The food is fresh and creative. Standing menu complemented by specials. We go back for salads + pizzas + short rib tacos.  Strong wine list too.

Most importantly - great people and service and local music some nights.
Sit at the bar and talk Laguna with Chris and the team.< /Review>

Overrated. Terribly expensive. I ordered the shrimp and scallops $34 for two little tiny pieces of scallop + 3 over cook dried out shrimp on a bed of fair risotto. Don't even think of getting what they called the Tower of seafood very very expensive and very little Seafood on it. Beautiful beautiful views.<//Text>

<review>I love this place. Intimate, local, with laid back feel.   The food is yummy.  Predominance of local California  (Central coast) wines, though other unique options available.  Tend to rotate wines and fun beers on tap.  Have live music during the week.< /review>< Date>

Cool spot, friendly staff. Very attentive to your needs, almost 5 stars. Food tended to be under seasoned. Not a bad thing, just a preference. A pinch of salt fixed that though. Again super staff!</Review>

<text>As an employee there I can tell you that their pizzas are fresh and hot from a wood fired oven. Their brucheta, salads and charcuterie boards prepared by yours truly have some devine meats and cheeses. Their burger is well stacked and their ice cream is made in house. Pistachio is my favorite. Kinda steep on the prices but you ain't working there so I am sure you can afford it. It is in Laguna Beach after all and rent aint cheap. Great wine and cool vibe. Check it out.

We are big Wyatt’s Paint fans!  In October of last year we brought our 40’ class A motor home in for a face lift.  It’s a 20-year-old RV and the clear coat was peeling off like a snake shedding skin.  She looked awful but we wanted to keep her so we decided to bring it to Wyatt’s.  We came in for an Estimate a few months before and we were pleased with the pricing and the detail that they spelled out on what exactly they had agreed to do.  We had obtained other quotes but this place impressed us more both in their capabilities and pricing.  They showed us around the shop and we could not believe how big the place is!   While meeting the people that were going to do the work on our coach, we found out how long they had all been employed there and worked together.  My husband and I felt that spoke volumes in terms of a good solid reputable company with good company culture!
The day we dropped it off we talked with our representative (Marty) about everything we wanted to address on the RV and he marked things up with a marking pen to document areas that needed attention and so forth.  Marty told us that we could come visit anytime we wanted which is what we did.  We came by every few weeks or so and learned a lot about the whole process and the fact that painting the RV was full of sequenced work and you can NOT hurry things or cut corners!  We enjoyed taking photos along the way and felt good about how things were going.  Getting this completed took longer than we had expected but we were clear with Wyatt’s that we had nothing pressing and we wanted things done right.
The day came where we got to see her finished and WOW she looked good!  Another thing I want to mention is that Marty told us to call them whenever we want get an update or when we had a question.  He was so good able taking a few shots of the RV and texting them to us.  We also got great service by calling the main number and leaving a message for someone to get back to us.  Marty and the owner of Wyatt’s are really great guys and did us well.  We highly recommend this shop!<//text>

if you own a company small or large  that involves vehicles or if your grandma  accidentally backs into your car  mistakes happen all the time and im sure you would need body work at some point , if your trying to stay professional that is. youll need a professional, trustworthy  and friendly company to deal with customer satisfaction is a must at wyatts and they make that clear. I strongly recommend them  give them a call. if you like you can tell them i sent you</review>

Horrible experience from a company that should have much higher standards. I was referred to this place by a close friend. I thought I could trust that they knew how to handle my vehicle. My car took a month and a half to fix! It was an $8000 plus job and my car was given back with other damages and uneven parts, lights not working properly, etc...To put it short Marty Prieto did not inspect my vehicle. I feel betrayed and taken advantage of. I called in to express how I felt about bringing it back in to Marty and he started yelling at me. I'm on my way into the shop to talk this out. I'm filing a formal complaint with Mercury Insurance today also. This is so wrong!.... Wow! I show up to discuss my car with camera rolling and Marty comes out very aggressive challenging me outside. He also had a juiced up gangster co worker with him. This has gotten way out of hand. Marty also got very aggressive with my elderly mother!! He threatened me telling me he'd find me in the city of San Bernardino! Well I'll be watching out for you Marty Prieto. Dont forget I'm a trained Marine Corps MP. I've never felt so disrespected. Never again will I do business with Wyatts!!<//text>

Wyatt's Paint and Body has treated us poorly and I wouldn't recommend them. On March 29th, 3 of our trucks were stolen.  Thankfully they were recovered with minimal damage and Chris at Wyatt's has had them since April 8th.  As of this date none of them are completely repaired. Chris said that he could do the work and accepted a job that is probably beyond his ability to complete but instead of just admitting that and letting us take our trucks to someone qualified, he has made multiple excuses for major delays.

After several phone calls and many false promises we were told that our trucks would be returned by the middle of May. It is now June 19th and we still have nothing that is completely repaired.

Chris told me in May that parts were still on order but I was able to document with the supplier that the parts were not ordered until 6 weeks after Chris had the trucks.

After over 11 weeks of waiting, Chris told me that he has plenty of other business and didn't need our business too. The insurance company has already paid him for the parts and for his labor.  He now tells me that he will not release our property until we give he a cashiers check for our deductible. He wants our money for trucks that aren't repaired. He won't even release the parts that he's been paid for so that we can have the trucks repaired elsewhere.<//review>

I am a Realtor and have used Green USA Cleaning twice for move-out cleaning and window washing for my seller clients. They have made everything look sparkling clean, which makes my listings look great. I have had zero issues with missed spots which makes my job easy. Professional, reliable, and good at what they do! Also, as a "green" Realtor, I appreciate that they use green cleaning products that are safe for people and pets. Way to be!</text>

The company responded very quickly, came out to give me a quote prior to so they knew what I needed done and there was no confusion.  They showed up on time, very organized, they knew exactly what needed to be done and went right to work.  My house is shining after my construction, can't wait for my furniture to come back tomorrow, I am now ready!<//Review>

The job they did was amazing. Everything was extremely clean and you can tell they care. The buildup in the corners of the bathroom shower were spotless which shows the attention to detail. The deep rug cleaning guys were so kind and explained everything. They were fast, efficient and made you feel great about the service you were getting. Highly worth the price and would easily get again.</Review>

One quick call, set and appointment, and the workers were on time, efficient, quiet, and did an excellent job cleaning windows on a 2 storey home.  I was super impressed by even when they moved an items to clean, they placed it exactly where it was when they were finished.  You could not even tell they were there except for the super clean/clear windows!<//review>

I’ve had Green USA cleaning come 1 time so far and love their service! They do an excellent job and if I have a special cleaning request they are sure to follow through. I will definitely be using their cleaning service again and highly recommend them.</Review>

<Review>I have a rental home which was in extremely poor shape. Tenants were there for about 20 years. The smell was absolutely like nothing I have ever experienced.  Walls were black, urine and droppings from 2 cats all over carpet and floors, kitchen had oil all over ceiling and walls from cooking, mold on floors, and windows/blinds were filthy. Green USA came in with their crew and after a few days the house was so much better.  The smells were gone, and the house looked great.

Daniel (the owner) is professional, experienced and did a great job keeping me updated, returning my calls/texts and delivering on what he promised. He made the entire experience/process painless!  His staff was on time, friendly and professional. I would use his company again with no hesitation.  I have high expectations and there is not one thing I can complain about. Thank you Green USA for your help.< /Review><pics>None</pics></record></dataset><record>

Accommodated us for a move out cleaning when another company cancelled. Quick and clear communication and follow-up. The 3 women who helped us clean were efficient and quick. They did the best they could in the 2 hours they were available - thank you (as this was a last minute appt.). I'd definitely recommend as a regular cleaning service.</text>

< Review>
We had our skylight windows cleaned recently.
I wish we didn't have to ask to go back and finish the job. It was substandard at first. But when we asked, they were friendly and didn't argue. Once they corrected their mistakes, everything was shiny and spotless.
Next time we need those washed, we plan on calling them again. Would recommend them to my friends.< /Review>

<text>Today was my first time using Green USA Cleaning Company’s services. Right from scheduling the service with Daniel, the entire process was very smooth. They even send you a reminder of your service which was very cool.

Anahi, Gabriella and Andrea did an excellent job cleaning my home today. They reached on time and got to work immediately. They split up the work and did a spectacular job of making my home super clean and shiny. Really, all my appliances are sparkling clean. They did a thorough job cleaning the bathrooms. One little detail that I really loved was the fact that they cleared out all trash and put in new trash bags. They also did a great job cleaning my plantation shutters that I have throughout my home. The whole house smells so fresh. I would definitely be using their services again.< /text></record>

We recently had our home windows cleaned through the wonderful team at Green USA cleaning.  They have done a phenomenal job.  The team arrived on time were thorough and efficient in their work.  The workers were polite and took care of the repair of some screens that were slightly loose due to general wear and tear.  We completely recommend their services and will be seeking out to them for future projects at home as well.  Thank you for a great job done,</Review>

I have been a customer with them for about a year.
I have a townhouse which is hard to clean my self.
Daniel is awesome and very responsive.

Things I like:
Kitchen cleaning is thorough. (internal fridge excluded)
Bathroom are refreshed every time.
One sweet thing my wife praise a lot is they help remove the trash and place new trash bags.

Will definitely recommend Green USA Cleaning to my friends.</text>

All staff were responsive, timely, respectful, and did a great job cleaning my very stained carpet. They even mopped their way out the front door to insure they hadn't left water spots behind.
I HIGHLY recommend this company and will definitely use them again.  Appreciate that they use environmentally safe products!< /Text>

Daniel and GreenUSA Cleaning did a fantastic job doing a full home “spring cleaning”, which included the inside, the windows, the kitchen floors/appliances, and the garage.  They were thorough, used less intense cleaning materials, and did such a great job that we have now signed up for a regular service with the same team.  Below is a picture of the tile cleaning machine that Daniel used in the kitchen, which transformed the kitchen tile grout.  We highly recommend the Green USA team.</review>

Over and above being the best quality cleaning, the communication being top notch makes life much easier. We are all busy and coordinating life can be challenging. I appreciate the detailed communication which is only valuable because the cleaning service is professional and detailed each time. I have waited to provide a review because in so many years I have learned any service can be fantastic the first few times but it is the character of the organization that keeps the bar high over time.  Green USA Cleaning will not disappoint.</text>

It was so easy to set up the appointment.  The cleaning team arrived on time and was very professional.  They cleaned the inside and outside, screens, and window sills. My windows have never looked so good.  They did a great job, we are so happy with our beautiful clean windows and highly recommend their services.  Will certainly use again.<//review>

The cleaning services were excellent. They did arrive 2 hours late because prior job took more time ( things happen) but they did a very thorough job. Whatever spots were left they gladly recleaned. Staff was very courteous and the team lead - Rosa- spoke English so communication was easy. I will refuse them. The manager - Danielle was prompt in answering phone and communicating.</review>

Very happy with green USA. They came wirhin 24 hrs of me calling, we're right on time, and professional. Was nervous to have people in my home during covid but they wore masks, double gloves and the owner reassures me they were doing everything to disinfect equipment and treat workers and customers with safety in mind. Easy, efficient, and thorough job for my carpet, rugs and couches</review>

I had originally written a review stating that the first few times i used this service were amazing but the quality had declined from there. Upon writing the review the owner called to understand what happened and apologize. He really empathized and was able to listen to feedback to help the team improve. Because of that level of service I changed my review from 2 to 5 stars. It’s common for companies to make mistakes, but the way they handled it speaks highly to their ethics and standards.</Text>

<rate>3</rate><review>A few things about the service:

1. They wanted to switch my appointment from Friday afternoon to Saturday at 8am. I told them it's not ideal, and asked why we couldn't keep the original day/time. I was told that everyone wants their houses cleaned for the holiday and they would call me back. They didn't. I called the next day to confirm my appointment and they told me Saturday at 8am. I luckily got it pushed to Saturday at 10am, but it was still confusing as to why I couldn't keep my original appointment.
2. Our tub got clogged the morning of the cleaning. We said it's probably best to skip the tub. We were told it would still cost the same amount. I thought a slight discount would be granted, even just $20 or so.
3. The ladies did a fabulous job overall, and we tipped them well, but I still noticed some cobwebs and baseboards that had spots after they left. I loved how well they cleaned my kitchen. The oven was IMMACULATE and I was very impressed with how much they did in such little time.
4. I enjoyed the look of my house when all was completed, so that's a bonus. I wish the cost wasn't so high, and that I could've kept my original appointment.<//review><pics>None</pics><Resp>{'time': 1547051912750, 'text': 'Hello Dani\nThank you for taking the time to write a review about your experience hiring our services and I am sorry about the appointment change we strive to do the best we can to attend all the appointments but unfortunately sometimes things happened that are not in our control and we need to make changes last minute.\nSince this was the first service and you book online we did not know the condition of the house.\nWe have a disclaimer on our website that all bookings are subject to inspection.

They were very good! Cleaned every part of the house as expected! No complaints. Great price too! They were very easy to communicate with via text messaging and their special website page which keeps you updated constantly - kinda like Door Dash has their map that tracks the food delivery. I will definitely be using their services again in the future. Thank you!< /text>

Green USA Cleaning just cleaned the carpets in our office, and WOW!! They did an amazing job. The owner, Daniel, is super responsive and extremely polite. His crew arrived early, worked diligently, and the final outcome was great. From start to finish it was so easy and fast working with these guys. I would not hesitate to recommend Green USA Cleaning to anyone.<//review>

<review>We had our travertine and grout cleaned and sealed. It was amazing how bright they were able to get it! I would definitely hire them again for that service. The office staff is great as well. Very responsive and easy to work with. Booking was easy. However, we also used their move in deep cleaning service. I would not recommend them for that. I found myself cleaning after they left. For the price, I expected better service. Communication was tough with the ladies as well.< /review><rate>5</rate><user_id>103171591286850878680</user_id>< GmapID>

Overall, the cleaning was ok. Excellent job cleaning the stove top. All  carpets areas vacuumed and hardwood floors mopped. Hard water stains are still present in the sink bottoms. It's visible only if you look closely at it. Our glass shower wall wasn't cleaned well. There are water stains still all over the glass walls in our shower.</Text>

I've been getting my house cleaned by Green USA for about 6 months now.  I am so happy and pleased with their service!  I love being able to depend on their regular visits, and receiving text alerts for arrival and departure.  Dependability and communication is very important to me, and they go above and beyond.  The ladies that do the cleaning always do a GREAT job... I would recommend their team to absolutely anybody.<//Review>

Tried there deep cleaning services and it wasn’t up to the mark at all. No attention to detail or thoroughness shown to clean the house.

The front door of the fridge wasn’t cleaned at all !
Cobwebs were not removed !
Kitchen slab had lot of stains !
While the deep cleaning services included vacuuming the upholstery, they didn’t do it until asked !</Review>

I have been getting my house cleaned by Green USA cleaning team for the past 1 year and they do a great job every time. I am happy that I am finally satisfied and do not need to look elsewhere for my house cleaning needs. On top of that, they are very affordable compared to many expensive cleaning companies. All members of the team take their time to make sure the job is very well done and the customer is happy before they leave the house.</text>

This company did a great job coming in and giving an estimate as well as scheduling immediate service after our tenants had moved out. The tenants never cleaned their bathroom, and the ladies that came just did a fantastic job. The only down side was that I noticed that they had left some chemical spots, so they came back the next day and wiped it down again. Which took away the spots. The bathroom looks 1,000x better.</Text>

I had a deep cleaning service with Green USA and they did a really great job overall, despite my older home, having two dogs and my house not having a deep clean in a while. There were only a few missed spots that I noticed but more overall positive aspects, like the fact my oven sparkles now and they were able to remove the rust stains from my sink.  Having used other cleaning services in the past, so far I think this is the best.  Unless you have a few days of uninterrupted time to do a deep clean yourself, I don’t think you could find any service that would do it better. I plan on hiring them as a regular service, so fingers crossed, I’m also happy with that too!</text>

First, let me say that booking the appointment was fast and easy.  On the day of the appointment, the dispatcher told me that the cleaning team could come an hour earlier, so that was a nice bonus. When the team go tthere, the lead took a quick walk-through and determined that the 3-hour estimate was not enough. She called HQ, and HQ asked me if an additional hour was acceptable. It was. It was great that they checked with me for advance approval, instead of getting 2/3 the way through and then asking. That's a good business practice. I appreciated it.

The cleaners did a fantastic job. They cleaned a lot of places I never thought of and did not expect them to clean. (above doorway moldings, the outsides of windows, the tracks for sliding windows).  When they were done, the place looked brand new. The team leader took time to show me some places that they were not able to clean because of access or misfunctioning sliding doors. I appreciated the candor.

Pricing was fair, even though they had to add one hour to the estimate.  I strongly recommend Green USA Cleaning.</text>

They were quick and easy to set an appointment with.
They provided me a quote quickly and called to confirm once they arrived and inspected the property.
I had them do a move out clean and they did a great job including extra attention to base boards, the appliances and bathrooms as requested.

Quick, efficient, and easy to work with</text>

The crew was on time and efficient. They performed the move-out clean in 2.5 hrs on the 2 bed 1 bath home. I wish they had properly dusted above all of the doorways (you could visibly see the dust from standing position) other than that a great service.</Review>

It’s honestly such a good investment for busy working people. They’re flexible with my schedule and everytime I’ve had to re-schedule they’ve been more than accommodating. Highly recommend them!< /Text>< pics>

The Green USA Cleaning team did an amazing job on our home. They used non toxic cleaning supplies where possible. Our home feels really clean without smelling like chemicals. I've already recommended them to a family member.< /review>

Daniel and his team did an amazing job for our move out cleaning. Our carpets were like new and the entire house looked immaculate.
I would definitely use them again for all of my house cleaning needs.</Review>

We have been using Green USA for last several months. Their service has been prompt and work consistent each time. Daniel is scheduling contract is easy to get in touch with and very accommodating to schedule changes, last minute requests etc. We have two small dogs who create quite a mess but Green USA professionals always manage to make our place look shiny and clean. We thoroughly recommend them for all your cleaning needs.< /review>

The whole experience was quite amazing to watch. I requested a deep cleaning service. The crew meticulously cleaned nook and corners of our home and spent nearly 3.5 - 4 hours doing so. They got tough stains on stove tops, had my windows and shutters look squeeky clean and even got the wall trims to be white again. They missed a few spots here and there, but overall did a fantastic job. With this level of quality service, I’m looking forward to my monthly service schedules.</Text>

<review>I used the same service for a carpet cleaning....professionally done.  I had a few wine stains that are faded now, which was expected.  But the other stains due to food spillage and everyday traffic came out. Carpet looks brighter and my place spells fresh. Best part is they are VERY affordable...3 rooms, 800 sqft... less than $200! Including a 10% tip! Highly recommend!< /review>< resp>

An impressive outfit.  A full list of services is lengthy, detailed,and completed on every cleaning. Crew arrives with all supplies and needed equipment. They are efficient, hardworking, and careful.  In six months of their service, I have not once been disappointed with Green USA Cleaning.</Review>

We have been using Green USA cleaning for over a year now and couldn’t be happier. Daniel makes the process of scheduling and even changing the cleaning times easy and convenient. They have an app. where you can see who is coming to clean, their contact info. and eta. The house always looks great afterwards and doesn’t smell like your typical house cleaners because they are mostly chemical free (a huge plus in my eyes). Definitely worth giving them a call to schedule a consult!<//review>

Green USA Cleaning Company is awesome! I was looking for months for a good and reliable house cleaner! I'm very picky because i'm type A and clean freak! With growing family, its been tough to do all the extra cleanings like side/head boards, windows, etc so I started working with Green USA for monthly cleanings. I work with Yeraldin's team and they are great! They are quick and detailed! And they are always open to any new things or additional things you might need done. Highly recommend!< /text>

Green USA was easy to schedule and their cleaners were reliable and detail-oriented. We loved that their pricing and cleaning options were very well listed on their website. We had a very positive experience with Green USA Cleaning Company and will use them again in the future.<//Text>

Overall they did a very good job and I am satisfied with the final outcome.

However, a few downsides that need to be worked upon,
1. They needed chaperoning
Eg: When asked to clean the refrigerator, they only cleaned the lower section and left the top part as is. I expected them to clean the oven (included as part of the the kitchen) but they weren't able to get to it in 1.5 hours.
They didn't bother vacuuming under a rug and I had to ask them to.

2. They definitely need to work on the speed at which they work - I did not want to micro manage but looks like that is needed. Customers expect less chit chat and more work when we're paying $120/hr.
They were able to clean 2 baths, 1 kitchen and dusted of the living room in 1.5 hours (3 women).

3. Communication was a problem. Since they did not speak English and I had to call someone to rely my message in Spanish.< /review>

Leaving 2 stars because the job they did was exceptional but i’m pretty upset that it took 3 people nearly 3 hours to clean my 750 sq ft 1 bedroom 1 bath apartment and cost me $250 with tip. I am a clean freak, I even cleaned up the night before they came, so there is absolutely no reason it should have taken that long. It takes me 1 hour tops to clean everything top to bottom on my own. I will be going elsewhere for business from now on.

UPDATE:
I just got home and they broke two of my blinds off while cleaning which I’m now going to have to pay for out of pocket. I’m now changing this review to 1 star because I’m extremely upset about all of this.</Text>

Terribly unreliable. We have booked cleaning services with them multiple times and each time they have not been able to follow through with the scheduled services because of overbooking their staff. We have a young man with autism who takes significant planning to get him out of the house for it to be cleaned, a situation which the co owner has been very insensitive to. Trying to work with them has been frustrating to say the least.< /text>

They did a move-out cleaning for our 2 bedroom apartment.  They did a fantastic job.  When we moved in years ago, there was black gunk burnt onto the stovetop.  I tried and tried to get rid of it, soaking overnight and scraping it away.  I had accepted that we would probably have to pay for it out of our deposit.
To my surprise when they fnished, I saw that  the hard black crust on the stovetop was completely gone!  They also let us know if they found any damage while they were cleaning, so we could take care of it before our walkthrough.  We had not realized that one of the light fixtures had a bulb go out.  They let us know :)

Everything was cleaned well, the specialists were friendly and, we are getting our entire deposit back!< /text>

<review>Today will be the last day we use Green USA Cleaning. They did an unacceptable job leaving dirt on the kitchen floors, not wiping down cabinets, and left burn marks on a rug without thinking to mention it to us. I have used them for a while but time to find someone who takes care of the work you are paying them for. No more second chances.<//review><UserId.>101575751298664418259< /UserId.></record></dataset><record>

The job they did was amazing. Everything was extremely clean and you can tell they care. The buildup in the corners of the bathroom shower were spotless which shows the attention to detail. The deep rug cleaning guys were so kind and explained everything. They were fast, efficient and made you feel great about the service you were getting. Highly worth the price and would easily get again.</Text>

<review>One quick call, set and appointment, and the workers were on time, efficient, quiet, and did an excellent job cleaning windows on a 2 storey home.  I was super impressed by even when they moved an items to clean, they placed it exactly where it was when they were finished.  You could not even tell they were there except for the super clean/clear windows!<//review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

<text>I’ve had Green USA cleaning come 1 time so far and love their service! They do an excellent job and if I have a special cleaning request they are sure to follow through. I will definitely be using their cleaning service again and highly recommend them.< /text><UserId.>111188541612078426630< /UserId.></record>

<text>I have a rental home which was in extremely poor shape. Tenants were there for about 20 years. The smell was absolutely like nothing I have ever experienced.  Walls were black, urine and droppings from 2 cats all over carpet and floors, kitchen had oil all over ceiling and walls from cooking, mold on floors, and windows/blinds were filthy. Green USA came in with their crew and after a few days the house was so much better.  The smells were gone, and the house looked great.

Daniel (the owner) is professional, experienced and did a great job keeping me updated, returning my calls/texts and delivering on what he promised. He made the entire experience/process painless!  His staff was on time, friendly and professional. I would use his company again with no hesitation.  I have high expectations and there is not one thing I can complain about. Thank you Green USA for your help.< /text><resp>{'time': 1615333845967, 'text': 'Hello Deborah\nThank you for using our service and on behalf of everyone at the company  Green USA Cleaning we thank you so much.\nIt was a challenge :)  but we got it done the right way and we are happy that you are happy with the final outcome.'}<//resp><user_name>Deborah Parkinson</user_name>< time>

Accommodated us for a move out cleaning when another company cancelled. Quick and clear communication and follow-up. The 3 women who helped us clean were efficient and quick. They did the best they could in the 2 hours they were available - thank you (as this was a last minute appt.). I'd definitely recommend as a regular cleaning service.<//Review>

We had our skylight windows cleaned recently.
I wish we didn't have to ask to go back and finish the job. It was substandard at first. But when we asked, they were friendly and didn't argue. Once they corrected their mistakes, everything was shiny and spotless.
Next time we need those washed, we plan on calling them again. Would recommend them to my friends.<//Review>

<review>Today was my first time using Green USA Cleaning Company’s services. Right from scheduling the service with Daniel, the entire process was very smooth. They even send you a reminder of your service which was very cool.

Anahi, Gabriella and Andrea did an excellent job cleaning my home today. They reached on time and got to work immediately. They split up the work and did a spectacular job of making my home super clean and shiny. Really, all my appliances are sparkling clean. They did a thorough job cleaning the bathrooms. One little detail that I really loved was the fact that they cleared out all trash and put in new trash bags. They also did a great job cleaning my plantation shutters that I have throughout my home. The whole house smells so fresh. I would definitely be using their services again.</review>< pictures>

They do a great job bit this time they did not change our sheets we had left out for them to do which they do each time. It was disappointing to have to realize that when they left.<//review>

I have been a customer with them for about a year.
I have a townhouse which is hard to clean my self.
Daniel is awesome and very responsive.

Things I like:
Kitchen cleaning is thorough. (internal fridge excluded)
Bathroom are refreshed every time.
One sweet thing my wife praise a lot is they help remove the trash and place new trash bags.

Will definitely recommend Green USA Cleaning to my friends.< /Review>

<text>Daniel and his team are very professional. They came to my house to give me an estimate and I had the first cleaning done early this week and they did a great job. I will be using them on an ongoing basis. I also appreciate the fact that they use green products -- good for the cleaners' health and ours. Thank you!</text>< pictures>

I was able to negotiate a fair price with Green USA and I would recommend them.  I'll use them again.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>

<Text>Daniel and GreenUSA Cleaning did a fantastic job doing a full home “spring cleaning”, which included the inside, the windows, the kitchen floors/appliances, and the garage.  They were thorough, used less intense cleaning materials, and did such a great job that we have now signed up for a regular service with the same team.  Below is a picture of the tile cleaning machine that Daniel used in the kitchen, which transformed the kitchen tile grout.  We highly recommend the Green USA team.</Text>< pics>

<review>Over and above being the best quality cleaning, the communication being top notch makes life much easier. We are all busy and coordinating life can be challenging. I appreciate the detailed communication which is only valuable because the cleaning service is professional and detailed each time. I have waited to provide a review because in so many years I have learned any service can be fantastic the first few times but it is the character of the organization that keeps the bar high over time.  Green USA Cleaning will not disappoint.< /review><username>Summer Short< /username><pictures>None< /pictures><Date>1591279419644< /Date>< gmap_id>

Called on a Saturday regarding one small second story room with pet stains and odor, odor being the main concern. Got an appointment for the following Tuesday. Two gentleman showed up 5 mins early to the appointment, and were very polite, professional, and confident. Service took barely and hour, and the results are fantastic. The lead technician [I didn't get their names] was concerned about a few smaller stains that they were unable to remove as they were too old [Although I'm not worried about them.] I will be using Green USA again in the future.< /Review>

Yeraldin and her team did a great job in cleaning our home. They were very detailed to clean ...for example they cleaned the microwave vent fan covers. The cabinets had grease on it but they did a fantastic job making them shine. Thank you!< /review>

The three ladies reached on time, they worked on the areas that we instructed and had no intention to stretch the time beyond what’s needed. We like the service, will call them again when we do regular cleaning.<//Text>

<review>I had originally written a review stating that the first few times i used this service were amazing but the quality had declined from there. Upon writing the review the owner called to understand what happened and apologize. He really empathized and was able to listen to feedback to help the team improve. Because of that level of service I changed my review from 2 to 5 stars. It’s common for companies to make mistakes, but the way they handled it speaks highly to their ethics and standards.<//review></record></dataset><record>

{'time': 1547051912750, 'text': 'Hello Dani\nThank you for taking the time to write a review about your experience hiring our services and I am sorry about the appointment change we strive to do the best we can to attend all the appointments but unfortunately sometimes things happened that are not in our control and we need to make changes last minute.\nSince this was the first service and you book online we did not know the condition of the house.\nWe have a disclaimer on our website that all bookings are subject to inspection. Due to the condition of the house we do a initial inspection before doing the cleaning to address if the price need it to be change the team of 3 ladies took a total of 2 hours and 20 minutes to complete the cleaning and it was over the estimated time by 20 minutes. We honor the price online.\nSorry for the parts that you feel we came short and I will address to the crew leader to be more careful and we continue to learn on every service we provide.\nThe initial cleaning is always more expensive because the house require more time but recurring services our pricing is different.'}<//Response>

<Text>A few things about the service:

1. They wanted to switch my appointment from Friday afternoon to Saturday at 8am. I told them it's not ideal, and asked why we couldn't keep the original day/time. I was told that everyone wants their houses cleaned for the holiday and they would call me back. They didn't. I called the next day to confirm my appointment and they told me Saturday at 8am. I luckily got it pushed to Saturday at 10am, but it was still confusing as to why I couldn't keep my original appointment.
2. Our tub got clogged the morning of the cleaning. We said it's probably best to skip the tub. We were told it would still cost the same amount. I thought a slight discount would be granted, even just $20 or so.
3. The ladies did a fabulous job overall, and we tipped them well, but I still noticed some cobwebs and baseboards that had spots after they left. I loved how well they cleaned my kitchen. The oven was IMMACULATE and I was very impressed with how much they did in such little time.
4. I enjoyed the look of my house when all was completed, so that's a bonus. I wish the cost wasn't so high, and that I could've kept my original appointment.< /Text>< Gmap_id>

Green USA Cleaning just cleaned the carpets in our office, and WOW!! They did an amazing job. The owner, Daniel, is super responsive and extremely polite. His crew arrived early, worked diligently, and the final outcome was great. From start to finish it was so easy and fast working with these guys. I would not hesitate to recommend Green USA Cleaning to anyone.< /Review>

I have been using Green USA for at least a year now and have been very happy. They do not use chemical cleaners, and have a steam cleaner that leaves every surface in my house clean and shiny.

The office staff is great as well. Very responsive and easy to work with. Booking was easy. However, we also used their move in deep cleaning service. I would not recommend them for that. I found myself cleaning after they left. For the price, I expected better service. Communication was tough with the ladies as well.</text>< Name>

Tried there deep cleaning services and it wasn’t up to the mark at all. No attention to detail or thoroughness shown to clean the house.

The front door of the fridge wasn’t cleaned at all !
Cobwebs were not removed !
Kitchen slab had lot of stains !
While the deep cleaning services included vacuuming the upholstery, they didn’t do it until asked !< /Text>

Thank you for being reliable. The windows and carpets look fantastic! Very thorough cleaners. Great housekeepers and very dependable. Nice people and super cleaners! My house always looks great when they are done! This company always accommodates my needs for scheduling.< /Text>

<Text>This company did a great job coming in and giving an estimate as well as scheduling immediate service after our tenants had moved out. The tenants never cleaned their bathroom, and the ladies that came just did a fantastic job. The only down side was that I noticed that they had left some chemical spots, so they came back the next day and wiped it down again. Which took away the spots. The bathroom looks 1,000x better.</Text>< resp>

I had a deep cleaning service with Green USA and they did a really great job overall, despite my older home, having two dogs and my house not having a deep clean in a while. There were only a few missed spots that I noticed but more overall positive aspects, like the fact my oven sparkles now and they were able to remove the rust stains from my sink.  Having used other cleaning services in the past, so far I think this is the best.  Unless you have a few days of uninterrupted time to do a deep clean yourself, I don’t think you could find any service that would do it better. I plan on hiring them as a regular service, so fingers crossed, I’m also happy with that too!< /text>

It's Important to describe exactly what you want to have cleaned and to check after completion.  They will also do special requests if needed.  They do a very thorough job and met my expectations.< /Review>

First, let me say that booking the appointment was fast and easy.  On the day of the appointment, the dispatcher told me that the cleaning team could come an hour earlier, so that was a nice bonus. When the team go tthere, the lead took a quick walk-through and determined that the 3-hour estimate was not enough. She called HQ, and HQ asked me if an additional hour was acceptable. It was. It was great that they checked with me for advance approval, instead of getting 2/3 the way through and then asking. That's a good business practice. I appreciated it.

The cleaners did a fantastic job. They cleaned a lot of places I never thought of and did not expect them to clean. (above doorway moldings, the outsides of windows, the tracks for sliding windows).  When they were done, the place looked brand new. The team leader took time to show me some places that they were not able to clean because of access or misfunctioning sliding doors. I appreciated the candor.

Pricing was fair, even though they had to add one hour to the estimate.  I strongly recommend Green USA Cleaning.</review>

They were quick and easy to set an appointment with.
They provided me a quote quickly and called to confirm once they arrived and inspected the property.
I had them do a move out clean and they did a great job including extra attention to base boards, the appliances and bathrooms as requested.

Quick, efficient, and easy to work with< /Review>

I loved the communication about what they would clean, what kinds of products they would use, and mostly arrival time. It’s so nice to know when to expect them and they even text when they leave. Great cleaning job and fair price.<//Text>

Daniel and his team did an excellent job with the move out cleaning of my rental. They were professional and very patient dealing with the owner when he showed up at the rental and started telling them what to do. I was very thankful for Daniel's skillful handling of a tense situation. So if you hire this team you will get a capable, professional and an all around good cleaning of your home.<//text>

The whole experience was quite amazing to watch. I requested a deep cleaning service. The crew meticulously cleaned nook and corners of our home and spent nearly 3.5 - 4 hours doing so. They got tough stains on stove tops, had my windows and shutters look squeeky clean and even got the wall trims to be white again. They missed a few spots here and there, but overall did a fantastic job. With this level of quality service, I’m looking forward to my monthly service schedules.< /text>

I used the same service for a carpet cleaning....professionally done.  I had a few wine stains that are faded now, which was expected.  But the other stains due to food spillage and everyday traffic came out. Carpet looks brighter and my place spells fresh. Best part is they are VERY affordable...3 rooms, 800 sqft... less than $200! Including a 10% tip! Highly recommend!</text>

An impressive outfit.  A full list of services is lengthy, detailed,and completed on every cleaning. Crew arrives with all supplies and needed equipment. They are efficient, hardworking, and careful.  In six months of their service, I have not once been disappointed with Green USA Cleaning.< /text>

The work is exceptional. Very detailed. Great for a deep clean, but the price is a too steep for it to be a recurring visit. Again, the ladies did a fantastic job. My house looks new.<//text>

It is so easy to set up an appointment; they are prompt and kind and efficient and do beautiful deep cleanings. Given that there are a baby and toddler in the house, I am especially grateful for a cleaning company that doesn't use harmful chemicals. Thank you!!< /Review>

We have been using Green USA cleaning for over a year now and couldn’t be happier. Daniel makes the process of scheduling and even changing the cleaning times easy and convenient. They have an app. where you can see who is coming to clean, their contact info. and eta. The house always looks great afterwards and doesn’t smell like your typical house cleaners because they are mostly chemical free (a huge plus in my eyes). Definitely worth giving them a call to schedule a consult!</Text>

Green USA Cleaning Company is awesome! I was looking for months for a good and reliable house cleaner! I'm very picky because i'm type A and clean freak! With growing family, its been tough to do all the extra cleanings like side/head boards, windows, etc so I started working with Green USA for monthly cleanings. I work with Yeraldin's team and they are great! They are quick and detailed! And they are always open to any new things or additional things you might need done. Highly recommend!<//Text>

<Date>1529357602115</Date><Rate>4</Rate><review>Overall they did a very good job and I am satisfied with the final outcome.

However, a few downsides that need to be worked upon,
1. They needed chaperoning
Eg: When asked to clean the refrigerator, they only cleaned the lower section and left the top part as is. I expected them to clean the oven (included as part of the the kitchen) but they weren't able to get to it in 1.5 hours.
They didn't bother vacuuming under a rug and I had to ask them to.

2. They definitely need to work on the speed at which they work - I did not want to micro manage but looks like that is needed. Customers expect less chit chat and more work when we're paying $120/hr.
They were able to clean 2 baths, 1 kitchen and dusted of the living room in 1.5 hours (3 women).

3. Communication was a problem. Since they did not speak English and I had to call someone to rely my message in Spanish.<//review>< pictures>

<review>Leaving 2 stars because the job they did was exceptional but i’m pretty upset that it took 3 people nearly 3 hours to clean my 750 sq ft 1 bedroom 1 bath apartment and cost me $250 with tip. I am a clean freak, I even cleaned up the night before they came, so there is absolutely no reason it should have taken that long. It takes me 1 hour tops to clean everything top to bottom on my own. I will be going elsewhere for business from now on.

UPDATE:
I just got home and they broke two of my blinds off while cleaning which I’m now going to have to pay for out of pocket. I’m now changing this review to 1 star because I’m extremely upset about all of this.</review></record></dataset><record>

These people take amazing pride in their work! And the green products they use are very good, the house smells neutral clean, not like cleaning products.<//Text>

I have used several cleaning companies for our house and none were very good - just ok
I researched and found green cleaners had consistently the best reviews so I tried them and I am pleased to say they are the best - they are professional and thorough and care for the materials of the house like hardwood floors
I recommend Green Cleaners< /Text>

Terribly unreliable. We have booked cleaning services with them multiple times and each time they have not been able to follow through with the scheduled services because of overbooking their staff. We have a young man with autism who takes significant planning to get him out of the house for it to be cleaned, a situation which the co owner has been very insensitive to. Trying to work with them has been frustrating to say the least.<//review>

< review>
They did a move-out cleaning for our 2 bedroom apartment.  They did a fantastic job.  When we moved in years ago, there was black gunk burnt onto the stovetop.  I tried and tried to get rid of it, soaking overnight and scraping it away.  I had accepted that we would probably have to pay for it out of our deposit.
To my surprise when they fnished, I saw that  the hard black crust on the stovetop was completely gone!  They also let us know if they found any damage while they were cleaning, so we could take care of it before our walkthrough.  We had not realized that one of the light fixtures had a bulb go out.  They let us know :)

Everything was cleaned well, the specialists were friendly and, we are getting our entire deposit back!<//review>

<text>Today will be the last day we use Green USA Cleaning. They did an unacceptable job leaving dirt on the kitchen floors, not wiping down cabinets, and left burn marks on a rug without thinking to mention it to us. I have used them for a while but time to find someone who takes care of the work you are paying them for. No more second chances.< /text><Response>None< /Response><Pictures>None</Pictures></record></dataset><record>
