I felt very safe the length of safety that they are taking during such trying times. I get it’s a small shop, so it’s hard to social distance. Yes I would like to go in to explore all the items who doesn’t, but I think the shop owners are doing everything they can to still serve their customers while also trying to keep their loved ones safe!!! It’s only a temp set up. Been shopping here for years and will always continue to. If you need to know where to fish locally, how to catch _____, what setup you need, and competitive pricing.... THIS is the shop to do so!!!< /Text>

<review>Nice guy behind the counter, was checking in charter costumers and helped me buy shrimp fly rigs even though the shop wasn’t technically open till 8. Also the rigs are costing ties and the bait is fresh.

I went in 2018.  The captain was a middle age man.  We caught a lot of rock cods, but they are mostly blue and brown.  I went again earlier this year.  The captain is now a younger man.  Now we caught mostly red and orange color fish which taste much better than the blue and brown ones.  He knew how to find the better fish.</Review>

Highly recommended! My husband and I went out on the queen of hearts on a rock cod trip. It was my first fishing trip. I was impressed! Eric was our guide, helper, untangler, janitor (they were very organized for a safe COVID experience) and fish filleter! He made sure we all had a great time and it was clear the guest experience was a great priority. We saw loads of whales, sunfish, jellyfish all day - Plus we caught our full bag limit with some beautiful big fish so that made it even better!

We will be coming back to try our hand at Salmon. Thank you guys!</text>

<text>We did the salmon charter on the Queen of Hearts. Departed around 6am (arrive to the boat early to secure a good pole position) and got back around 3pm.

The staff was attentive, jovial and respectful of the ocean by making sure cigarette butts and trash that ended up on the deck was swiftly and appropriately discarded. Professional crew and fun to boot.

Would book with them again.< /text><GmapID>0x808f73b7c6cf3a6d:0x87cfa5e7a6a3fdb1<//GmapID>< Response>

shop has most things you need for your adventures out on the water.  bait stuff, fishing stuff, crustacean stuff, light snack stuff; even eye glass leashes w/ floaters.  unfortunately last week I had a altercation with a new fellow behind the counter.  after buying a bunch of stuff since its been a while, out of the store I checked my receipt and thought I was overcharged.  Inquired back to the dude.. dammn.  I work with the public too so I gave him every chance but how many times are you going to change your story and berate a customer with false accusations?  after he said the "Oakland A's suck since Money Ball" my inner troll came out..thats going too far.  (A's=Best in the West).  eventually he got Harbor Patrol involved and he looked like the innocent victim while I'm here trying  not to get them to call the sheriff.  I tried to record civil servants on public property but Harbor Patrol said nope?  luckily my bro-in-law called and magically they went away since I had a witness on the phone.  scared my Nephew and almost ruined his 1st day out on the water.  needless to say I think I'm banned from the store by their charter boat deckhand from his own mistake.  seems legit.  If I need bait I guess I can use their vending machine..?<//text>

The lady at the counter isn't that friendly. I'm not sure what it is. I've been there multiple times and she's always been quick and to the point although I see she asks how other people's days are to the "regulars". She also gave my father attitude when he asked about a certain rig for squid which was rude it was just an honest question. The queen of hearts is a great boat but waking up and visiting this store isn't a great start to the day. On the other hand this store does have what you need from day and year fishing licenses to rockfish rigs to weights.</review>

<review>I bought a 9' fishing rod on Saturday September 2 for $45 plus tax because I wanted to go crabbing with my son. After 2-3 hrs of using the rod the real handle came off so I thought that there would not be any problems returning it or exchanging since I had just bought it but to my surprise the chubby guy with an attitude refused to do a refund or exchange. I didn't even get a receipt when I made the purchase, he said I have to contact the manufacturer to get a replacement or refund. What do you think people? Is this fair to you? They wanted to save the $45 I gave them but in reality they lost more (a client, it wasn't my first purchase) I won't shop there anymore and I'll tell all my family and friends to not shop there. Now, it's your decision if you want to have a bad experience like I did. You have been warned. Staff isn't friendly at all. I hope the guy sees my revie and remembers me 😁< /review>< rating>

One fisherman on the boat caught waaaayyy over his limit so the deckhand spread out the fish between the anglers. This forced all of us into our limit and we were forced to go home. Definitely wasn't worth the 90 dollars we paid for.

{'time': 1528912852271, 'text': 'I\'m sorry you thought we were pricey.  I do the best I can as a small local "mom and pop" shop to keep our prices as low and competitive as possible.  Most people are actually surprised that our prices are very reasonable when they really take the time to compare our prices to the price they pay at other locations.  We always strive to have the items that work best in our area at the best price we can offer in stock throughout the fishing seasons.  If there was a particular item that you thought was priced too high, please let me know so I can check into it.  Good input will help keep us in business so we can continue to serve the needs of Half Moon Bay anglers.'}</Response>

<Review>Great structured play spaces and plenty of natural areas for kids to engage in free play and nature play. Wish the reserved picnic tables were near the playground. Also, watch out for large amounts of poison oak in the natural areas - this isn't a manicured park, but that might be just what you're looking for.< /Review>< resp>

Good size park. Clean, lots of stuff to do. Light forested area, baseball diamond, tennis courts, picnic tables, playground. Kids aged 2 and 4 had a great afternoon. PokemonGo Gym at the park and the baseball diamond has a PokeStop, for those inclined.<//Text>

I love this park! I used to take my son here all the time when he was little. Is equipped with a nice size baseball field, tennis courts, two parking lots, bathrooms, play park for little ones and picnic area with bbq pits and benches. I believe spots can be reserved for large parties thru the city of Monterey. All in all, a nice clean, safe, family and pet friendly park.< /review>

Small park with playsets for kids. Wood chip sandbox is rough on falls, but not a litter box for wild animals. Baseball field, basketball courts, tennis courts, and wall ball court all are free for public use.<//Text>

< review>
When I arrived the workers were all on their phones laughing and made eye contact with me but didn’t help. They took about 10 minutes to finally get off their phone to come help. The worker that was looking at my car was very rude and wasn’t wearing his mask, standing way too close, and not telling me what was wrong with my car. I had to ask him multiple questions in order to figure out what I needed. He was speaking really low and I couldn’t hear anything he was saying and was walking away when I asked him questions. Never going back there again. I should’ve just gone to Jiffy Lube, they’re the best and super nice!</review>

I was told have a good a veteran's discount. , which is nice. But then, the man said we have to charge you for putting tape around the headlights. I was getting there. Headlight restoration. I have never heard of such a thing as charging you for putting tape around the headlights. They did do a very good job of cleaning the headlights, but charged putting tape on.< /Review>

<Review>I was making the 320 mile drive home to Arizona when my van started wigging out. I called my husband and he called more people and researched. They thought my alternator may be going out and to me to look for a Pep Boys to test it and replace it if necessary. I drove 23 miles on the freeway in the middle of nowhere peaying I didn't break down. Not a good place for a newly pregnant woman and her 6 yr old son to be. When I got to Pep Boys, they saw my distress and immediately helped me. They got me in fast and explained the issues to me. In the end, the issue was not something that could or needed to be fixed right away. They checked my oil, added a quart and sent me on my way, assuring me I'd make it home safe. I have NEVER experienced this generosity at any auto parts or repair shop EVER before now. They cared about me and my situation, not lining their pockets.< /Review><pics>None</pics><Resp>{'time': 1561765522543, 'text': 'Thank you for the fantastic review Nikolle!

<Review>Bought tires on sale. They mounted and scratched my expensive chrome rims. After a month of management reviews they basically said “ cannot - will not repair as they came this way”. If I didn’t like the response just “sue me”.
What awful customer service. NEVER EVER WILL I BUY FROM THEM!
If you have expensive rims - stay away from this store!</Review><Time>1564525658466<//Time>< Pictures>

<user_name>Michael Charles Desert Real Estate, REALTOR< /user_name>< review>
The customer service I received recently at your Indio location was just horrible. I contacted the service department on Sunday at 1:30pm to get a quote for quite a bit of service on my 2003 Ford F150. I just picked up my truck at the dealer and they quoted me 4k in repairs so I thought I would get a quote from Pep Boys since I have been a loyal customer for over 25 years. When I spoke to the gentlemen I gave him detailed description of the parts and service needed and he said he would call me back shortly. At 4:30pm I decided to call back and check and I was told he would give me a call back in 20 minutes. No call back again. At 7pm I decided to drive down there and get the quote in person. When I was finally able to speak with the guy at the counter I told him everything that had transpired. He said he was the mechanic and it was probably his manager that I spoke to and he already left for the day. He searched everywhere and couldn't find any notes or a list of items needed. He said this sounds like its going to be a complaint and took my business card and said he would make sure I was taken care of first thing Monday morning. Still no call from anybody. I'm done with Pep Boys and will never return for anything ever again.< /review>

<Text>I have had bad experiences with other Pep boys in the past but this one has changed my mind. I always come here to get my car serviced and they have exceptional service and are able to answer my questions. It's worth the drive from my house in Palm Desert and they always have good deals.<//Text>< resp>

<review>I would give a zero rating if that was possible for the Indio Pep boys location. I needed a battery for my car and because it's a hybrid a lot of places that have batteries for my type of car did not have it in stock. Although I did not want to go to Pep Boys because of a shady experience I had with them a few years back where they tried to charge me for labor on installing a replacement battery that did not last the warranty time (I mean I wouldn't need it installed if the battery you sold me lasted past the guaranteed time- seems like a scam to me), I only went back because I really need my car for some appointments I needed to get to.  I ordered the battery online and also had their online system find a match for my car. Many reviews on the battery said it was made for my type of car/model. I also followed up with a phone call after my online order and scheduling appointment to confirm (based on other reviews saying the store did not always check online info). I verified that the battery was in stock, my appointment was set, and the battery was correct for my vehicle. Upon arriving for the appointment, I was now told that the battery ordered online does not fit my car, and the only one that would work was $100 more expensive but no worries they had it in stock. I asked why I hadn't been told the day before when I confirmed over the phone and the staff stated sometimes they don't know until they see the car in person? That seems odd to me being that you work in the auto parts industry and you're not sure if something fits unless the car is in front of you.  This place just seems to continue to waste peoples time and money with they have poor customer service, unprofessional behavior, and inexperience. Would not recommend. I took my car elsewhere by the way after i had them jump start my battery so I could drive away. I saw on other reviews they may block negative reviews from the Pep Boys website which is why it looks more positive. Check Yelp for more credible reviews, so many 1 star posts.</review>< Rate>

< Review>
Man, am I glad I got the warranty. I came in earlier with a problem that was under warranty and was greeted by Shad. Shad was very expedient and professional. I explained my problem to Shad and he verified my information, took my keys and with a great attitude, let me know that I didn't have to worry about it because it was under warranty. My vehicle was patched up before I could browse the store and make a couple purchases. I have zero complaints.</Review>

<Text>I would not recommend anyone to take their vehicle to this Pep Boys for any kind of service. I will spare everyone the gory details, but after leaving my car all day to be fixed, several hundred dollars and 2 more visits later--another mechanic has had my car for 5 days trying to do repairs that were missed by Pep Boys...all bad. 😩</Text><UserId.>118219561361679734901< /UserId.>< Pictures>

<text>Repair Warning: dishonest repair manager.  Avoid this pep boys location.  I have been using pep boys for my car repairs for the last 20 years and when my car broke down from traveling from Arizona to California with my wife and kids, I called their repair facility to make sure they could fix my car before I had it towed in.  They said they had time and would be able to replace the belt that broke, that day.  They also said they had the specific serpentine belt for my Mercedes in stock and it was 19.99 plus labor.  After towing my car there, the repair estimate turned into a $589.00.  As I was in a bind, I said fine, but I wanted to know the break down.  All of the sudden the sales manager said they didn’t have the parts in stock and would have to locate them. Long story short, he fumbled with the computer for 25 minutes claiming to be searching the town for my parts.  When I asked him how much the parts where, the belt was $54, tensioner was 280 and labor was over $200.
When I questioned him on the prices he stated that he had no belt for $20 and that the belt tensioner was the best price he could do.  Now, I was not expecting on-line prices but I felt I was being taken advantage of so I asked him if he would price match. ( During this time the mechanics, who were sitting in the 8 car bays they have, kept coming in trying to take the keys so they could start.  The service manager said for them to wait.)
I then showed him A belt tensioner on-line that could  be purchased For as little as $35.  2 miles down at auto zone for $119.   The manager said he would try to do it but didn’t think it would work on his computer.  After a few clicks the price was suddenly $350 total.  I told him fine let’s do it and I’ll pay.  He then said he wasn’t sure that he would be able to do it today and he would go ask his mechanics.  He then went outside for 15 min, totaling 40 min since start.  When he came back he said “ we don’t have time today....come back tomorrow.  I then Asked him why did you say you could do it over the phone today and that you where just finishing up a car doing the same job and could get right on it?  Plus I just had my car towed there when I could have towed it to 10 other mechanics.  He just laughed and said “we don’t  have time.  They guy you talked to already left.”
Not having any options, I waked to their parts department and bought the belt.....which was in stock the whole time for $20.    I then drove my car 2 miles to auto zone with no power steering and bought the belt tensioner for $119 and took the 30 minutes and changed them myself in the parking lot.

Lastly, I had made an appointment on line and even when I pointed that out, he said that it just meant he would start on it but they wouldn’t finish it.  But when I told him I called them before to verify they could replace the belt at 2:30 and told them I would be there in and hour., he said his mechanics already left for the day.  I brought my car in on a tow truck at 345pm, I left there at 4:49 pm.  I chenged the belt with mediocre tools i bought from pep boys in one hour.   I was back on the road at 6pm and saved over $450.00.   Oh and when I drove back past their shop, the 3 mechanics were still standing around in the 8 bays with only one car that was having the brakes replaced.

This place is shady, they lied to my face, they lied to my wife and I on the phone and they artificially increased the prices because they knew I was traveling and tried to take advantage us.  I wouldn’t be surprised if this is the norm for them.
Don’t go here, anywhere else is better than this place</text>< gmapID>

<Text>Set up an appointment. They called me later but I did not recognize the number so I didn’t answer because I get a few random numbers calling me from time to time.

It’s a 25 min drive from where I work so I head over and get there about 5 mins early. I wait in line for 7 mins only to be told that they tried to call but the guy who does the service I need is going to be gone for a few weeks which is fine.

The problem though is that didn’t care to leave a voicemail when they called. Then I wouldn’t have wasted time or gas driving out there just to be told they can’t do anything. This was a huge inconvenience for me and very unprofessional on their part. Is it really that hard to just leave a voicemail saying they cannot provide the service I need and not waste people’s time?< /Text><name>TJ Lyttles< /name><Resp>{'time': 1533945267352, 'text': 'We are sorry you had that kind of experience and appreciate your feedback.

< review>
Bought 4 tires for my truck that showed on sale in the current weekly ad. Spent 10-15 minutes talking with the Sales guy trying to get the sale price. Got the sales price, had the tires installed and a front alignment done. Got back to the RV Park found wrong tires were install, instead of LT tries, they installed Passenger Tires which have a much lower load range. This was for a truck that obviously is being used to pull a RV so of course I need the load rating to be equal to the OEM. If I didn't happen to notice, I could have had a major blowout and accident while towing our trailer and someone could have been seriously hurt or killed. The tires were then replaced later that day but I had originally had Cooper H/T's put on and when they replaced the LT tires they put Cooper AT's on without telling me that is what they were doing. At this point, since they were the correct LT Load range and it was late in the day, I decided to just go with them. Jump a week ahead and someone mentioned to check the date code on the tires and I couldn't find it on the side facing out. Yesterday I looked on the part of tires facing inside and these tires are over a year old and the bluing is all cracked. Wow, screw me once shame on you, screw me twice shame on me. I should have just asked for my money back and went elsewhere. I would give a 0 star rating if it were possible. Also, the sale guys who messed up the original sale was the guy who gave me the paperwork when the tires were replaced - Not even a sorry from him.

On a side note, I tried to leave this review on the Pep Boys site and it keeps rejecting it as not adhering to their guide lines. Now I know why the Pep Boys reviews look OK, any real bad ones are just rejected.< /review>

<name>Justin Vanderpool</name><text>*Do not conduct business with this store-
I was sold a part that was not needed for a repair. I went into the store with the receipt and talked to the Manager- Carlos, in an attempt to get a refund. I was told that he could not refund an open product. I showed him that the product was still factory new and after a long conversation he offered store credit. I declined the store credit and demanded a cash refund. He refused. I am now stuck for $127. I will never shop there again due to the poor service and tactics that they use. Because of his rude demeanor I am going to take the issue to small claims court.< /text><userid>105214213451619618780< /userid>< gmapID>

< review>
Very poor service. I work at a body shop. I ordered hub caps on Tues and was told by Fri they would arrive. I called Thursday and they didn't know what I was talking about, and they would call me back. They didn't. So I called them. After a while, they said it should arrive Fri. Fri day came and they were not in. Plus earlier that day, I ordered a part that was in stock and they never called for me to go pick  it up.<//review>

<Rating>1< /Rating><Text>Unreliable & poor logistics: I called the local branch and with their advice I ordered 2 tires online. I confirmed on the phone with service agent that the tires would be there and be able to replace my tires. I showed up to my appointment and they didn't have my tires. No courtesy call and no rescheduled offered. Told me the truck would deliver between 12-3, how can you make an appointment if you can't provide the service! Took time off from work to fix the problem and I'm still on a donut will miss more work to fix the problem. Time is money and they got me for much more than the price of a couple of tires.

Go to America's Tire(next door), they have a warehouse and tires in stock and able to service right away. I learned my lesson and still waiting to hear back from corporate office on this issues.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures><response>None<//response><Gmap_id>0x80daf8290aea6abb:0xca3799310710ddce< /Gmap_id></record>

<Text>Bad customer service experience. I made an appt for 3pm, I got there 10 minutes early. The guy didn't even try to let me know he acknowledged me. When he was done answering the phone calls he turned to me and asked what I needed. I told him I had an appt and attempted to tell him I had a coupon. He didn't even look at me and said " give it to us at the end it's going to be an hour". I needed an oil change so I said ok. After an hour I asked if they were doing the tire rotation which was included in the coupon. With a big sigh he said they were very busy but he would tell the guy to do it. Then I told him that I tried to show him the coupon and he responded "well if you would have told me". I ended up getting my car back 1 hour and 44 minutes after my appt. The online page has a 30 minutes guarantee. I guess it depends on the day? I'm very upset with this visit and will never go back.</Text></record></dataset><record>

I came her and bought 4 new tires and an alignment. The guy upsold me the cabin filter and the air filter and I bought them both. They forgot to put the cap for the calbin filter back so I had to go back to get it fixed. Also the car was still going to the right and they didn't fix it but made me come back. When I came back they put the same excuse that there was no time to fix it for the mechanics. Made me wait a very long time to get it fix. Tip for the guys here "Make it right or make it twise".<//review>

I just wasted a gallon of gas. Coming here. (Only pep boys in area)guy I spoke with on phone, told me I could come in. online it says they are open till 9pm. It says that. And they tell me they are only open till 8pm. Says it's Always been that way. (then I think they should update the store/service hours!) So I get here at 6:40pm. And he tells me They can't do it. they have only one  truck on the rack. (Out of 11 bays) That needs an alignment done before 8pm. (but it wasn't on the alignment rack, just a normal one) And while he's telling me I can't get in. For 20 mins. The truck is just sitting untouched. And their were three mechanics (including himself). Yet none are doing much of anything. And he's needed to help the other guy. No Alignment takes more than one mechanic. Unless you're not a very good mechanic.  Der de der fella's. Said they can make me an appointment for next day. Forget it. I'm not wasting another gallon of gas, just so I can get an oil change and free tire rotation. I choose pep boys because I've never had issues with other stores. And was a frequent customer to one that was shut down back in LA. They  should of told me that over the phone, instead of wasting my time and fuel. All that time they sat around doing nothing. He could of got it done. And as I was leaving, he was filling up the bays with what I assume were other customers cars to protect them overnight. But when I arrived out of 11 bays, only one was occupied. And it wasn't even on the alignment machine. So I assumed 'Awsome!' this should be quick. Instead what I got were 3 lazy mechanics who didn't want to change my oil. Done right it can be done in 30 mins tops. Complete with inspection and tire rotation. I arrived within 1hr 20 mins left till closing. Would have been 2hrs and 20 mins. Had they actually closed at 9pm. This place is a joke. Took me less than 5 mins to notice that. Poor communication skills. Lazy workers.</text>

Never go to this station for any auto work.My car required Smog certification by DMV.Smog certification has 3 categories of tests i.e.Visual inspection, Functional check and Emission tests.My car passed in Functional check and Emission tests but failed in Visual inspection.They offered me $ 139 diagnostic package which I rejected.
After few days, without doing anything on my car, I went to another smog check station and my car passed in all the tests required for smog certification.No diagnostic was necessary.Diagnostic package of that station was $ 65 only.<//text>

Had my brakes checked here. The labor charge was overpriced ($80+) but did not have much choice in the matter. To add to the misery there was no free WiFi. Ahhhhh!!!!!!!<//Review>

I went in to get a diagnostic and they told me it would take all day. Well I called half way through out the day and they told me it was ready. I had to call for them to tell me that it was ready. And they weren't able to fix my problem because they didn't have the proper machine. Horrible at calling customers to let them know that it was ready.< /Text>

<Review>They seem always short of help.   Went in today to see about replacing a tire...after leaving American Tire just around the corner who were so busy...no Place to park.  Plenty of parking at Pep Boys cause Pep Boys were not busy.   Went in only one guy handing the counter and he was running back & forth to the garage area.  I left after never being asked what I needed.</Review>< pics>

(Translated by Google) I always visited this place for a long time but nowadays nothing is the same they are very loose they do not accept people without an appointment the same as in the cathedral before you arrived and they told you how long it could take and if you accepted they changed the oil today everything is wrong or way to look another place I think it's because of the handler

(Original)
Siempre visitaba este lugar por mucho tiempo  pero hoy en día nada es igual son muy flojos no aceptan personas sin cita lo mismo que en cathedral  antes llegabas y te decían cuanto podrían tardar  y si aceptaba  te cambiaban el aceite hoy todo está mal ni modo a buscar otro lugar  creo que es por el manejador< /text>

I’ve taken my puppy to this vet since I first got him so they have all his files on hand. He was misdiagnosed with having a tennis ball stuck in his back intestine. Had she done a little research in to his file or asked us what we thought may be wrong with him I believe this surgery never would have occurred. Turns out his intestine was inflamed and my dog had gas. Again had they referred to his file when we took him back on 1/17/20 and had the same exact symptoms believe this never would have happened. Instead of using an Endoscope, CT Scan, Ultrasound or someone that specializes in imaging first to determine exactly what it was if they were still unsure they thought having surgery was the best, first and only option. Do not trust this vet and would not recommend anyone taking there pet there. Forgot to mention they’ve not once apologized or taken responsibility for there $4,000 vet bill. I do understand that people make mistakes but as customer I do not think my family should have to pay it.< /text>< Pictures>

<review>My mistake was trusting google reviews. I thought this place would take good care of my cat and because this place is way more expensive than other places, thought it would be better. (they charge $200 dollars for Ringworm test for example and it has been a month still didn't get the culture test result.) We emailed them weeks ago to call us back and they still haven’t called. I spent way over 800 dollars on the first visit for testing and such and this is what I get. We were always polite and never rude. We didn’t even bother them at all. We simply just wrote emails with some questions. 2-3 emails over 3weeks. That is all. When the vet called before we sent the last email, she was talking over us and didn’t listen. If you don’t listen and pay attention to our questions, how would you even answer them? They don’t  call you back, they don’t respond much, and the vet says they are super busy. If you are so busy then don’t take customers. Just decline, so people can find another vet who have time for customers. It is so weird how this place seems like they only care about money when you trust them to take care of your family. My friend had a bad experience with this place and warned us , but I still trusted this place. I was a fool but I really thought they care. I thought so because that they are checking lots of thing and charging for all lot of stuff. We never got any certain answers and lots of information was vague. So I gave up. I’m really sad about the whole thing and I blame myself for trusting this place more than anything.< /review><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None< /Response>< gmapID>

Very pleased with our experience here. I was able to get my dog in same-day for an urgent appointment. They were very responsive, accommodating and best of all, reasonably priced. They also have extended office hours which works well for folks like me with traditional work schedules. I'll be switching permanently from my long time vet at another well-known "chain" clinic. I was referred here by a friend who also had a great experience and has referred a 3rd person here. I too have referred someone. Highly recommend!<//review>

Pet emergencies can be terrifying, so it's crucial to find compassionate and patient veterinarians. Every DVM and tech at McGrath has been so kind to us. I have never felt confused or unsure about our visit, because they take the time to fully explain the treatment options and answer any questions.  You can really tell how much they love animals!  One of the best practices we've ever been to, 10/10.< /Text>

Declined helping my dog when he needed them the most. We needed steroids for him as a life saving emergency pill and they simply declined prescribing or even have the DR call us. The Dr. hides behind the staff, 2 of the staff had to come out to tell us to leave when we were waiting to speak to the Dr in the parking lot, dr refused to speak to us. I thought they were suppose to care about pets but clearly they only care about money and charge office visits without giving medications the pet needs. We have been seeing them since he was a puppy (he's 4 now) we will never go back again, very disappointed.</review>

Customer service is almost ALWAYS a problem. I have been spoken to as if I am NOT a paying & loyal customer of this pet clinic for 2 years. Very much so looking for a new Vet office. Dr. Lim is AWESOME however the disrespectful nature of those answering the calls and scheduling appointments is NOT worth my hard earned money.</text>

Having spoken to the customer service representative in question, it appears that she was under the mistaken impression that you wanted to speak directly to our pharmacy. Even considering that mix-up, she should have taken the time to listen more carefully to your needs, and we’ve instructed her and the rest of our staff to be more cognizant of our clients’ specific requests going forward. As for your concerns about the cost of our care, we always try to provide a wide range of treatment options in an effort to secure the very best outcomes for our pet patients. We never want our clients to feel pressured into paying for extraneous services or tests, and our veterinarians are careful to offer estimates and alternatives upfront. Thanks again for your input. We've put it to use as an important training and learning tool."}</resp>

I have used Mc Grath Veterinary Center for several years. Dr. Habib tried to pressure my family into spending upwards of $800 on x-rays that she said we're NECESSARY, only to learn from Dr. Miller that my dog was diabetic and had no need to be exposed to unnecessary radiation. She also tried to charge us over a thousand dollars in cushing's disease tests to find out from another vet that my dog only needed a temporary liver supplement. Today I called for the 4th time in 7 days to make sure my dogs prescription had been ok'd by the doctor. I'd left numerous messages on the pharmacy line without a response. When I called today to explain that and check on status the receptionist, Victoria cut me off, told me she was transferring me to the pharmacy and as I attempted to explain that I was just transferred from the pharmacy she said, "well I'm going to transfer you to the pharmacy line, ok thanks" and disconnected the call. She only offered an appolgy after being notified that I would post this  review. It's sad to say that this is par for the course at this practice. The doctors attempt to run up their billables with unnecessary tests and the front desk staff turns over every month. This lack of leadership has led to a pervasive problem with unprofessional practices and horrific customer service. The lack of accountability, and professional ethos is appalling. The receptionist, Victoria took no responsibility for her actions, blaming an ailing pet that the technicians were caring for, for her rudeness, lack of compassion, and condescending attitude. Customer service happens when things don't go according to plan, that's when you show your clients that we are just not walking credit cards and our pets health should not be held hostage so they can cover their mistakes. I will be using another vet moving forward and I only hope their negligence does not hurt another person's beloved pet.</review>

< review>
Mcgrath has a great reputation and I don't doubt their staff's ability to care for the animals, but my only experience with them made me realize they were not a good fit for us.
Generally, I think it's tough taking a cat to a clinic with dogs, especially when a drop off is required due to the pandemic, so the odds weren't in our favor going in.
The vet I spoke to over the phone was kind and took time to hear me out when I described my cat's worrying behaviors, but seemed busy and told me that she thinks my cat is 4-5 years older than I believed (he was a rescue, so we don't know for sure) which was pretty shocking news. I wish we could have discussed that more, and that I had gotten a little more counseling on the medication they prescribed, especially because they were much more expensive than the cats-only vet I normally use.
When I brought my cat home, he was shaking for the rest of the day (I'm guessing because he was scared of the dogs in the facility). I had never seen him so scared, even when we first brought him home from the rescue. My cat's lasting anxiety after the visit meant we wouldn't return, but all of that said, I do think they would be a great vet for dogs.< /review>

{'time': 1598549054688, 'text': "Hi, Claire: Thank you for taking the time to leave such a thoughtful review of Sterling’s most recent visit to our clinic! We’re sorry it proved so stressful for you both. Curbside service is obviously not ideal, particularly for cats, as well as their owners who may understandably be worried about their pet. We’re afraid that curbside service, along with our peak hours, combined to give you a somewhat skewed impression of the level of service we provide. If you're willing, we'd very much welcome the chance to further discuss Sterling’s care and address any questions you might have about the antibiotic we prescribed or how our new understanding of your cat’s age might affect treatment plans going forward. In the meantime, we hope Sterling is happy and healthy!"}</resp>

<review>I am so thankful for McGrath Veterinary Center.  My kitten was originally been taken care of by another veterinary facility.  At around 11 weeks he became extremely ill and my original vet did not have the time to take care of him.  I contacted McGrath Veterinary Center and they were able to see him the same day which probably saved his life.  The doctors and vet technicians here are amazing.  Immediately, the vet took blood and found out what was wrong and made a treatment plan to help with his kidney failure.  The vet kept great contact with me updating my small kitty on his progress.  She called me at least 3 times a day to update me because of the quarantine I am not able to visit my kitty.  All the staff are very compassionate and really care for the animals they treat.   I am so glad I brought my kitten to McGraths in his time of need.</review>< date>

The lady I was in contact with was unprofessional and rude. I specifically asked how much would it be to schedule a certain appointment for my pup and once the appointment is done they tack on extra money after the fact- and did absolutely nothing to help my puppy.

Thanks. Some people are going through a tough time right now- and if you really cared about animals you wouldn’t have to scam their owners who genuinely are worried about their health.<//Review>

Excellent Vet!  I recently went to the Sunday vaccine clinic.  So helpful for those of us who work full time.  I was in and out in under half an hour and it was reasonably priced too.  I also go there for regular care and they are great.  Would highly recommend.</Text>

Recommended by a trusted friend, McGrath vet center has proven to be a wonderful choice for my family.

I take my two dogs to see Dr. Lim, when she’s available, who is absolutely delightful. She’s knowledgeable, experienced, professional and very helpful. We also saw Dr. McGrath who, naturally, was also really great.

We appreciate the help and timeliness of the vets and the front desk staff. I’m really glad we found a place that we feel comfortable with and I definitely recommend them!<//review>

We ended going to the wrong veterinary location and did not have an appt. With them. However they took us and our puppy right away. Everyone was so pleasent and helpful especially the one nurse who helped us with our Pomeranian/pitbull puppy. She was very knowledgeable and resourceful. Our puppy loved her as well. Thank you McGrath Veterinary Center. This is our puppy's new home for health. 😃</Text>

I've always had an excellent experience at McGrath Veterinary Center, from the front office to the vet techs and the doctors. I could not be happier with the service and attention I have received. Dr. Moon has been so incredible and personally followed up with me about my pet when I needed to go to the internal medicine department at ACCESS for an ultrasound. I so appreciate the kind and caring attitude of everyone at McGrath.< /Text>

The technical staff is very highly educated and trained which makes all procedures safer than minimally trained staff. There is a strong culture of working with owners to ensure their furry family members get the best care within the constraints of things that may be going on in someone's life outside of the pet's illness. The staff is treated very well and they all absolutely love animals. I had to leave for personal reasons but they are definitely one of the best places to get veterinary care in Los Angeles. Highly recommended for routine care or anything complicated.</Review>< pictures>

<Review>My dog had some discharge from her ear this morning (Sunday), called McGrath after a Google search and they had an appointment avail in 15min.  Offices are very nice.  Staff at desk was very nice and a one -page questionnaire  was all of the paperwork required.   I met with Dr. Chin, good guy did some work on my dog's ear and sent me on my way.  I was there less than an hour and with such nice people I was never worried about my dog when Dr. Chin took her in back and she came out as happy as always.  Whole thing was about 45 min.<//Review>< Pics>

The staff were so friendly and helpful. We were able to go to our exam room right away after checking in. My pups are usually super anxious at the vet and being able to curl up on the couch made them noticeably less nervous. The appointment was easy and quick, though I didn't feel rushed. I also really like that I got the results of the heart worm test while I waited. Every vet I've used in the past usually calls me a day or two later, so I need to wait. This is by far the best vet experience I've ever had.< /text>

Dr. McGrath and his staff took incredible care of my dog; I truly cannot day enough positive things about my experience; through my tears and my angst and my dog’s pain; Dr. McGrath and his entire staff has been patient and caring.. and most of all they did not give up on my boy. It is such an incredible relief have this boy in good hands again. I am well aware that it takes all the patience in the world to deal with us; Dr. McGrath was my dog’s first vet 11 years ago and I am just so happy that my boy is once again back in good hands. Thank you Dr. McGrath and staff for taking care of my boy! I know that he and I are a handful 🙏🏾</review>

<rating>5</rating><Review>Hands down one of, if not the best vet clinic in the valley. McGrath and his whole team are super nice and genuinely care about the well being of your pet; they are treated as a valued family member. From the moment you walk in and are greeted by the front desk with smiling faces you feel you are being taken care of and a priority. Dr. McGrath is super knowledgeable, kind and very patient with my skittish large dog. My dog is a large breed rescue and usually runs from any vet staff member but he is calm around  Dr. McGrath.
The facility is new and has some in house lab capabilities; and is super clean. Not to mention I am a big fan of the exam rooms, big with animal safe chairs and a couch.
I strongly recommend this vet clinic to anyone who needs a vet, or any vet service. Not to mention his prices are more than fair (cheaper than most other vets), and better quality care than many other vets in the area.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

I'd say that this place is a bit more on the pricey side, but I'll pony up. The staff is really  sweet, knowledgeable, and care about your animals. Even the ladies who are at the front desk are able to tell me if my concerns necessitate a visit and they've told me no multiple times so I'm rest assured that they're not just trying to take my money. The vets (Dr. Moon who is no longer there, and Lim) are super great with my cats. They take the time to really answer my questions and are thorough with each visit. They have flexible hours and scheduling so it's pretty easy to get an appointment there. There's also free coffee and tea for the humans, and treats for your four-legged buddies!<//Review>

I had to go through a lot of terrible offices and emergency visits before I stumbled upon the awesomeness of this place. My animals trust all of the vets (especially Dr. Lim), they are fair in their assessment of what is actually necessary for care of your pet rather than tacking on every single possibility. I don't recommend any place else.</review>

I’ve always had such a positive experience at McGrath. I relocated to the west side and tried to find other vets in my area and tried one that came highly recommended, but neither me nor my pooch were  happy. We had to go back to McGrath where we were comfortable - and it’s well worth the drive :) Everyone there is always so friendly, prompt, kind and to top it off, the facility is very clean. I especially love the room with the couch so my fur baby can sit next to me.  Most importantly is that everyone has always been so great to my Pittie, including every vet I’ve ever met and the techs. So glad I found them! I highly recommend them to anyone that’s looking for a a great fur doctor 🐾👍🏻💯< /Text>

< Review>
Dr. McGrath helped us last year with our 19 yr old kitty who was at the end of life - when our regular vet of 20 years didn't even answer the phone or call back.  Mishka is 10 and Oliver is 5, both came in Thursday with issues - and again the McGrath staff couldn't have been nicer or more professional.  Thank you :)  Connie Huffa<//Review>

< review>
We have 2 dogs and have entrusted their care to Dr. McGrath and his staff.  Always have had good experiences and think this is a GREAT office.  A while back, when arriving home from work, we found that one of our dogs was sick.  I called and Dr. McGrath was already in his car about to leave for the day.  The receptionist caught him before he drove away and he waited for us to bring SanDee in for treatment.  I'm not sure this would happen at other vet offices.  When Dr. McGrath first opened his office, I stopped in to check it out since it is very close to my house, and he kindly gave me a tour.  He has a great 'bed side manner' and while I liked our former veterinarian, I'm so glad my dogs are now patients at Dr. McGrath's office.  Their tails always wag as they walk in -- so that is a good sign!<//review>

This place came highly recommended from a few people i know that live in the valley. I live in dtla and i traveled in hopes of good service. When i arrived i was rudely greeted by the receptionist. Not only was she rude but she showed no compassion or understanding or concern for the well being on my dog. This place is the WORST place ever! All they want is MONEY! They will drain you dry and let your pet suffer in pain until it dies. Their prices are ridiculously high for the worst quality of service. DO NOT GO TO THIS PLACE! Don't let yourself be a victim of this horrible institution! This place needs to be shut down for MALPRACTICE!! They misdiagnosed my dog and did nothing to save him. You would think after robbing me of $4,000 they would at least let him die feeling no pain. The look in his eye will forever be in my mind and i couldn't do anything to help him. THANK YOU DR. McGRATH FOR KILLING MY BABY.</review>

They are super friendly, knowledgeable, patient and really have your pet's well being at heart.  I have been three times now and have always been seen at short notice- although I don't understand why they are not booked out weeks in advance..!  As well their excellent service, they never try to upsell you on anything you don't need: I took my cat Flyer in for an ingrowing nail and had asked how much it would be.  They quoted me a 'worst case scenario' at $250.  I went in fully prepared to pay that- but it only ended up costing me $70, because he didn't need any extra care.  I am so happy to have found a clinic that is this good as well as trustworthy.  These reviews helped me make the decision to go here in the first place, so I figured I would make sure to pass my experience on for the next animal parent.  :)< /Review>< Rating>

The worst mistake I ever made for my two dogs. Botched surgery and dog isn't recovering.  I was told by a neighbor to avoid this clinic and I wish I had listened.   Our other dog was given incorrect medications for several months and which evolved into hearing loss.  Dr McGrath is in the sales business and nothing more.  I hope this review help others as this is a serious matter.< /Text>

<Review>They are monsters. I took my dog there on Monday. Did a blood test. Next day he was worse. I ran back. The only thing they do well is to shove into your face the estimate. I agreed to $1000. But after 2 hours of him being in agony in the back room they came out and said because I didn't sign, they didn't do anything. Amazing. But they did the unnecessary xray. Then they told me his chances are zero and they advice on euthanasia. I was so upset but I thought I need to follow their advice. My daughter was begging them to do it with her presence. He flatly refused saying it was against the law. They brought our dog out to us to say good bye and they took him back. After coming home we did some search on yelp and saw bad reviews and other people were writing we did have the right to be present for his last breath. So next day we went back to confront them and said that now we know it was our right. He quickly changed his tune and said why didn't you ask me. We would have done it in the room. WHAT? We were begging you. He said then get out of here and never come back and he proceeded to call the police. I wanted the police to come, but noone came and we left crying. My daughter also asked him what happened to our dog and where was he. He looked with such hate on us and ignored. She was hysterical, wanted to know. Cruel people who abuse their customers. I placed a review in Yelp. Next day it was gone. I placed again next day. It was gone. It means they police Yelp.</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< GmapID>

Most people don't go to the vet if things are good. We were no exception. When my wife's bestfriend Max was seriously ill, we went several places before we found this facility. After a thorough, careful examination, the doctor laid out our options. Many of them were incredibly expensive and complicated. He gave us a very honest, heart-to-heart about what was best for us, and most importantly what was best for Max - he suggested valuing the time we had left with Max instead of prolonging his suffering with expensive treatments that would do very little to actually improve his life. A short while later, when it was time for us to say goodbye to Max, we came back. They were incredibly kind during a very hard time for us, and we'll never forget it.<//text>

I will bring the others too. If the time comes they need treatment, ofcourse. I was very pleased with this place.

I visited 4 different Veterinarians in the last 8 months and did not like any of them. They were either arrogant, inexperienced, insensitive, or gone out of the exam room in 60 seconds. I was getting really discouraged! Then a friend told me about McGrath Veterinary.

I called and made an appointment. When my dog Kip and I showed up for our appointment, I was totally impressed! Their office is shows pride of ownership and is clean, bright and open. The reception desk had 3 staff members ready to greet me.

Desiree checked me in, (she is amazing) and then was taken to an exam room. On the outside door they had written Kip's name. The exam room is awesome. It has a couch in it!! So Kip and I chilled on the couch until Dr. Habib joined us.

All I can say is that Dr. Habib is everything the other Veterinarians were not. She is hands down the best veterinarian I have ever met in the last 25 years of having pets. This woman is AMAZING! She is professional, knowledgeable, personable, empathetic and takes the time to answer questions without making your feel rushed. She is talented and skilled. I trusted her to do surgery on Kip and I am so glad I did!

Oh and if you are wondering about their prices. McGrath is very reasonable and what I would consider a bargain given the high quality of their care and expertise.

If you are looking for a veterinarian, stop now and call McGrath. You will be sooooo glad you did!< /Text>

While it was a terrible situation Dr. Mcgrath was very patient with my multiple questions, and even took time out of his busy day for my phone calls. When it was time, the entire staff was very kind and comforting, I cannot say enough. It was such a terrible time for me personally, but the doctor and staff made it as easy as possible. This is probably one of the best clinics I've been to, I would highly recommend it.<//review>< Pictures>

My Chacha has been dealing with excruciating leg pain and I found McGrath Vet. Reading the reviews made me feel at ease but once we got there I was blown away by the staff and Dr. Moon. They are by far hands down the top vet clinic in my eyes. Dr. Moon was extremely amazing at making us feel at ease when he was explaining Chacha's condition. He was very empathetic and showed he really cared. The staff also showed compassion and they all are efficient at their work. I highly recommend this clinic to anyone who truly wants their pet to get better. My Chacha is now doing well and this Saturday we will be going for our surgical consultation which turns out the surgeon is a friend of Dr Moon. Thank you all for all that you do and Dr. Moon thank you for being awesome and giving us that peace we really needed. See y'all soon !< /review>

Dr. Habib changed his medication, put him on Cold laser therapy and now our boy is back to walking like a champ! We live quite a distance from McGrath, but the care & follow through makes it worth the 30 minute drive. The front office staff & the technicians are all excellent.

< Review>
The worst!!!!!!! If I could give them zero I would, they only wanted money , my puppy 10 mounts old , was brought in by me , he was feeling not well , didn’t eat , and move ... they said he had pancreatitis, he didn’t suffer from pancreatitis .. he ate a piece of string ... they couldn’t see it in the ultrasound, but they didn’t put an effort to keep investing.
I left my puppy there for 1 week , everyday I was there , still he didn’t get any better , they still charged me between $600-$900 everyday , to just let my puppy stay there in pain but they had no answers , they said maybe tomorrow he will be better blah blah ....
noting changed on Sunday after a week I wanted answers why I spend over $4000 and my puppy is still dying . 10 mouths old( let me remind u)
I got very upset, starting demanding what I deserve more tests and ANSWERS. The vet dr McGrath was so awful , he called me and said leave the place and u can take your puppy I will not treat him no more . That was disgusting!!!!! On Sunday when there were no other pet hospitals Was open , and my puppy was on IV which kept him alive , he sent him to his death . After us begging him , he came and did more checks which made him understand something is blocking the way of food to enter, he had to do a surgery. We agreed just to have a chance he could save him. It was TOO LATE maybe they couldn’t save him, maybe yes because it’s been a week ... the string was too tangled around his intestines after a week ,while operating there was noting he could do .he had to put him to sleep .So I was asking myself why could he made all those tests the day I brought him? Why he left my puppy to stay in pain for a full week??? If there was no chance of saving him , why he only cared about money ? And not my puppy ? 10 mounts old!!!!!!!! That’s my review about this place , I had a very bad experience with them . Failed to mention some of the girls in the front were very rude to me , no simpathy , I was crushed there everyday , that I needed to come and see my puppy in such condition. They didn’t care. It’s seems like they see so much death. That is my review. Thank u for reading this far. If you’re dog is in a serious need of seeing a vet . I wouldn’t recommend this place.<//Review>

< Review>
Dr. McGrath is absolutely THE BEST VET in this entire area!  He is kind, caring, thorough and extremely knowledgeable.  I am a savvy and sophisticated consumer when it comes to medicine both for my family and my pets, and there is no vet who tops Brian McGrath in so many ways.

I have been going to Dr. McGrath for over a decade, following him through 2 other vet centers and now to his own in Sherman Oaks.  I am not a “schlepper” but getting my dog the best care possible means going to Dr. McGrath---and driving from Pacific Palisades to the valley as I pass  many other veterinarians along the way.

Brian McGrath graduated from the top vet school on the East Coast, and is smart and wise when it comes to diagnostics and treatment.  He is also an outstanding surgeon.  I went to a W.L.A. animal hospital several years back and asked the staff who their best surgeon was (out of a couple dozen doctors that worked there) and they recommended Dr. McGrath.  The surgery went flawlessly and Dr. McGrath was so conscientious at follow-up afterwards.

Compassionate is an understatement when referring to Dr. McGrath.  He came in to his closed office on his day off when my beloved dog was dying.  He talked with me and helped me understand why putting him to sleep was truly the best option.   I could not have had anyone better---with his huge and caring heart, to be with me but Dr. McGrath at that difficult time.

And, if this was not enough for an outstanding vet, there is one more thing:  his prices.  Dr. McGrath is extremely fair in all of his charges.  He does not recommend additional treatments that jack up bills but may be unnecessary.  His skill and the amount of time he spends doing thorough exams are first rate, but his charges for such high-quality treatment are not.  The old adage: “you pay for what you get” does not apply when it comes to Dr. McGrath.

Go to this happily married father of four---and son who grew up inspired by his father, also a veterinarian, and you will be as devoted a follower of Dr. McGrath as I have been for past last dozen years.< /Review>

<Review>My friend had a huge traumatic experience with this place. They insulted her, denied her to be present at the time of euthanasia.Her daughter was scarred beyond believe. They paid $1000 And were treated like beggars.When they walked in there next day they were told to leave in very bad manner and they even threatened to call the police.They put the review on  yelp and next day it disappeared.</Review><userid>101155942414533533084<//userid><Rating>1<//Rating><Date>1532239233663<//Date></record>

I've been here 3 times and all 3 times,  the customer service is limited and short with words.  This will be the last time I go,  I paid for the pedicure option and it was short lived.  Still no conversation due to language barrier.  I paid 35 $ for the option 2 and gave a 5$ tip. I then trusted the service was complete although shorter then usual.  I found nails that were uncut on my big toe. I will not be going back because there is no welcoming feeling or conversation.<//text>

Holy cow! I made an appointment for a fill at 4:45 and that's exactly what time I sat down in the chair and she started working. She knew exactly what I meant when I said that I didn't want to lose any length just reshape the coffin. The entire appointment took approximately 45 minutes and she was very detail-oriented through the entire process. This is easily my most favorite set of nails I've ever had.< /text>

Came here with my cousin today and they were super nice! Very proactive. It was my cousin’s first manicure and the technician did an amazing job. I’m not from around here but I’ll definitely come back next time I’m in town.</review>

My experience was so poor I nearly walked out and regret that I hadn’t. The women working seemed inexperienced and I had concerns about hygiene. My cuticle was cut while being trimmed and it became inflamed and bled. The paint job on my manicure is already peeling and it has been less than 48 hours. I do not recommend this place to anyone.< /review><pics>None</pics>< response>

<Review>They were quick and did a much better job than the last place I went; perfectly reshaping my short coffin nails. They also close at 5, not 7 but stayed later to accommodate. Will definitely be going back.</Review>< GmapID>

<Rate>1< /Rate><text>I have been going to Teresa's nails for about a year now and I see the owner, Vivian, and every single time I see her I
have to wait at least 15 minutes.  That wouldn't be a problem except I make my appointments about 3 weeks in advance ( I've even tried being the 1st appointment of the day which is around 10 and she STILL gets there late). There's absolutely no reason for them to be late for my appointments, I've done the best I can to work it out with them and all she says is, "you have to work with me". Um, no I don't, I'm the client and they should treat them with respect and constantly being late over and over again is very disrespectful.  This place is very unprofessional and I will not recommend this to anyone and if they ask me about my nails I will tell them where not to go!!</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None< /response><gmap_id>0x809adbf564c03273:0x9993231ef302ccde< /gmap_id></record>

<Text>My car was hit & run and my insurance gave me Caliber Collisions info. It was so easy to get my car in. They even arranged a ride for me to the rental car company. I was given and estimated completion date for May 21st and I was driving my car on May 20th. I am 100% satisfied with the customer service and repair of my vehicle. Thank you so much Caliber Collision.< /Text>< pics>

I recommend you ask for Henry Montoya!!! My car was in a minor collision against a wall and the wall won. The bumper became detached and wouldn't latch back on and it also was torn in multiple places. Looked like Wolverine clawed it.

I asked a family member for any body shop recommendations and they recommended I visit Henry Montoya at Caliber Collision in Gardena. I took the car to him, and Henry was super friendly, told me exactly how he would repair the bumper, and he even said he could fix a tennis ball sized dent I had on my passenger door. Henry kept me informed during the repair process, which was really a nice touch and much appreciated! He let me know when the bumper was being installed, when it was getting painted, and when it would be ready for pickup. Henry even delivered the vehicle ahead of schedule, in just a couple of days!

Upon delivery, I noticed they washed my car and left it looking very shiny, the inside had that "new car smell," and the car looks brand new now! The repairs are excellent and the paint matched up perfectly to the rest of my beautiful yellow shine colored car! I am so impressed with both the repairs and the service and will definitely recommend Henry Montoya at the Gardena location to all my family and friends! He will treat you like family and have your car looking brand new again!! He'll take super good care of you just like he took care of me!<//Text>

<rating>4< /rating><review>After any accident emotions are tensed and raging! Very few bumps in the road with a few words exchanged and a little more understanding made everything worth it. Very clean and professional establishment. Any insurance claims or personal claims will be taking care of immediately! I really appreciate the professionalism this establishment have shown. FYI just make sure your insurance have dealings with this establishment before dropping your vehicle off! It makes life easier and everybody job much better. I will update any other info if needed (you are in good hands)< /review>< pictures>

<Rate>1< /Rate><text>Horrible, stay away. I had to take my car back several times for them to fix something that should have been taken care of on the first and only visit. I don't think it's that they don't know what they are doing it's more along the facts that they don't really care. I honestly lost track of the times I had to leave my car with them to fix something, but sure enough everytime I did they would "fix" one issue and make a new on it at the same time. At the end of it the insurance paid for the repairs not myself. But I would never personally give them my own money. The car was never repaired properly but I honestly didn't want to deal with them anymore so I lived with the issues they made. Please do yourself a favor and if you have to deal with them NEVER pick up your car at closing time. Dusk time will mask issues with any car. Twice they called me right before they closed to tell me it was ready, they planned it that way so I wouldn't notice the horrible paint job and random details they never even addressed. Long story short STAY FAR AWAY. Negative a billion stars if it would be an option.<//text><pics>None<//pics><resp>None< /resp><gmapID>0x80c2b58df9877699:0x8241087d7fafc987<//gmapID></record>

This place is running a business like a scam. I have a claim from AAA to bring the car in for an estimate. They look at the damaged for about less than 10 seconds and give out a cashed out value about $2000, but if you leave the car there to get fixed they would charge the insurance company for the amount 5 times the cashed out estimate (~$10,000). II recommend to stay away from this place...I have an appointment at 4:30pm and they make me seating there waiting for them to come out. What’s a bad service! The person doing the estimate did not a straight answer why so much different between the cashed out value and the cost to get the car fixed?<//text>

This is the worst location to get your vehicle repair the mechanics and body shop staff don't have a clue as to how to repair your vehicle after an accident.  They can take it apart but they will never put it back together as it should be. Missing bolts missing air flap they forget to reconnect vital vehicle components truly unknowledgeable staff I drive a 2016 Lincoln MKT it took them two different types of repainting to attempt to get the color to match and still it have to go to a different location Carson Caliber Collision but not before is set for 6 months and even after I showed them pictures and sent them to the insurance company and the insurance company advise them of the situation. Their very own quality control personnel reassured me that the vehicle was good to go and ready for pickup after I went to go pick up the vehicle I pointed out to the duty manager where the missing bolts and missing components that were still missing of course she apologize but what good is an apology if the car has been sitting there for 6 months the car finally had to go to Lincoln South Bay to get repair the right way and to add all the missing parts finally they sent my vehicle to Carson Caliber Collision. To get a final third attempt to get the paint correctly truly this is the worst location do not take your car to Caliber Collision Gardena<//text>

<Text>I wouldn’t trust this body shop at all when they tell you when your car will be ready they are very known for this luckily for me I was planning to take my car here but there are some that I know that I’ve gone through this painful process and considering some of us really depend on our cars to make a living wage you may want to rethink about bringing your car here for service everything else seems to be good but it’s just the ending part they don’t do too well at all....</Text>< gmapID>

I had my first accident and came here to do an estimate. I made an appointment and they didn't save it in the computer so I had to make another one.A few days later, I went to do my estimate and they took the pictures of the damage. I'm waiting for my insurance to tell me my estimate. I did the estimate over a month ago and still to this day I still don't have it. Turns out, they lost it and didn't contact anyone for me to come and do it again. They even had the audacity to tell my insurance that I just never showed up. Do not go to this place they are extremely irresponsible. I regret coming here.<//Text><pics>None< /pics><Response>None</Response>< GmapID>

<Text>I had a very smooth experience with this place. From scheduling an appointment online, all
The way down to the repairing process. The staff and atmosphere is very professional. I was greeted with a warm
Smile from EVERY employee at the shop. This place is like a 5 star hotel
In the auto body shop world. Jose was the one handling all
The extra business. All did was sign and sit back. A car even picks you up to take you to get a rental. I was rear ended so my bumper was fixed. When I went to pick up my car it looked like a brand new car. They even detailed the inside of my car and I can't lie it was a mess. Ladies know make up and hair can really take a toll on the interior lol. My car is amazing. When I see it I get so excited lol. Thank you thank you. If your auto insurance doesn't have an account with them
Cancel and find one that does lol. You won't be disappointed. Thanks JOSE!!< /Text>< gmapID>

Amazing experience. The servers were very accommodating to our dietary restrictions and made good recommendations. The food was beyond amazing for the price point and the ambiance was great. The menu is small but very well thought out and there's many vegitarian and vegan substitutions.</Text>

Server was nice and atmosphere is nice but the only vegan options on their menu are olives or spring salad. (Menu on their website shows edamame but it's no longer in their menu.) They will not do separate checks.< /review>

<Text>Only two Vegetarian options.
The atmosphere and the service was very nice, the staff was helpful and I enjoyed the esthetic, my only dislike was the menu. Of course I know not everyone is vegetarian but these days it is becoming easier to find vegetarian options at restaurants. If I had to take a guess I would bet the new Chef here really dislikes vegetarians. We eat more then just salad. The two options where grilled cheese and flat bread.< /Text>< gmapID>

<review>Horrible customer service from both the waitstaff and bartender, but the food was pretty good.
I asked for extra bitters in the Velvet Remix drink and the waitress said it’s “insulting” to request a change to their “craft cocktails”. I requested an extra dash of bitters, not to change the whole drink. I received major attitude from the waitress and bartender about this simple request, they are not accommodating to their guests at all. Although the food was fresh and the patio is beautiful with an MCM vibe, the customer service was so bad that I will not be returning, nor will I recommend it to others.</review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>
{'time': 1617580733943, 'text': "Hi Jena,\n\nThank you so much for letting us know about the conversation you had with your server. You are correct that a server should never tell a guest that a request is insulting and I apologize for that behavior. We make all of our cocktails from scratch and there is love and care in the craft, but that does not mean we cannot accommodate a guest's wishes. We do value and appreciate your feedback and please know the behavior has been corrected. Thank you again.\n\nSincerely,\nSommer"}< /response>

<review>I'm not one to frequently review a restaurant, but this place blew me away so I have to. All the service, from the hostess, to out waitress and the servers, everyone was very polite and friendly. The first round of cocktails were so. dang. good. that we ordered the same again, then switched it up for the next cocktails and they were delicious as well. We ordered 6 food items and they ranged from good to blow my mind. Items like deviled eggs and fish tacos were just as good as most restaurants (there's not much you can do to make them out of this world, but they were good). Items like the Ahi Tuna Crudo and the RIBLETS  were like out of control good. Next time I go I'm ordering like two of those each! There's still enough on the menu for us to go try everything completely new next time, and we look forward to the opportunity. Even the music they played was all up our alley. The setting was very nice as well and enjoyable despite us going on a cold evening. Highly recommend this place and have been pushing it on my friends.< /review>< GmapID>

< Review>
The place has good vibes, really cute the only thing is the food is not the best. The fries were the best compared to the rest. We ordered a good amount of food with my friends and nothing tasted that great. It lacked seasoning and just not the best quality. Mac N Cheese was not good at all. Drinks were good. Also one of my friends waited for her food for almost an hour, we asked multiple times and it got too long so we canceled it. We ordered at the same time so I don't understand why that happened. The area they have is cute but wouldn't be back because of the food.<//Review>

Great food and ambience with a friendly service staff. The food menu is small, but the quality and taste were excellent. If you're seated near the bar it's somewhat loud, but not the loudest I've experienced. I look forward to returning when the weather is warmer and having a drink with friends in the patio.</Text>

<Text>The food, ambience, and service were outstanding. I felt completely comfortable with the safety measures put in place. We went during brunch and ordered a burger, smoked salmon benedict, and scone. Everything was delicious and I would order them all again. Highly recommend!<//Text>< pictures>

Ordered the Shangri-la Burger. First off great atmosphere. Upscale.

The disappointment was the food. It had potential. My nephew also ordered the burger. Great fries. Ordered the burger medium. Waitress didn’t appear to believe we had a choice. Presentation was excellent. Burger very small. Both of our burgers were burnt overcooked hockey pucks. Not one bit of moisture in them. Lucky I had water. Finally, twenty seven dollars for one burger fries and water with tip is ridiculous. If I come back it’s just to hang out and have drinks, chips and salsa.</Text>

<text>Very good food, very friendly staff, great outdoor space. We ate indoors and made a reservation. Bit of a wait for placing our dinner order and happy hour is at the bar only where there isn't much room. Over all an enjoyable evening! We will definitely return! UPDATE. On a return for weekend  brunch,  service outdoors is really not good.  Several of our friend's  party waited over an hour for food and ended up cancelling. They need more wait staff and help in the kitchen.</text><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None<//response>< gmap_id>

Cool Vibe and good food
Warm and friendly staff. The flank steak was seasoned and cooked to perfection.  It was a bit pricey considering it was a la carte, but tasty. Guests playing Bocce, while listening to smooth sounds playing in the background.  Parking can be tricky. Luckily I arrived as guests  were leaving.  Definitely recommend this spot for a chill evening with friends.<//review>

Was welcomed happily by greeter who informed on new covid protocols with aplom. Food was excellent, waitress was attentive and not overbearing. We felt we got a good value for what we paid for. The only knock I would have is the cocktail I had was a little small on the pour side, but this is only one sample size. We would go back in a heartbeat, the vibe here is fantastic. And of course a post dinner walk around the park to see the chickens.< /Text>< Pics>

This was our 1st time here. Was a little too cold to enjoy the outside area. We did find space at the bar though and had a couple Oaktown browns and a very strong stout to go along with the sausage platter and fries. Very filling on all accounts.  Will definitely come back again.</review>

Pricing a little above my idea budget for family style when multiple dishes should be ordered for a good meal.

<Text>There were some really good positives to this place:
Location is amazing.
Atmosphere is great.
Service was good.
Drink choices were good.

The only negative right now is the quality of the food, but it was opening night so I'll have to check it out once they've got the menu dialed in.< /Text></record>

We have been going since it opened.  Started as 5 stars. Food is great. Drinks are very interesting and delicious. Love the old fashioned.  Since then, service has been sketchier.  They need a better system to handle inside and out.  Inside was very loud.  Still love the outside and ambience on a nice delta-breeze evening.  I hope this place keeps up the great work and improves on service a bit mor, so it can start a trend that we really need:  Style, quality, taste, and fun! I am so tired of the chains in the burbs and having to drive to mid town---this is a great option!!  We will keep going and hope it blossoms.< /review>

It was interesting the food was very attractively presented and tasted good. I'm not sure that we would make another visit there but will keep our options open.  Perhaps after they have settled in we would give it another try.< /Text>

<Text>I have been waiting for this place to open!!! Got to check it out last Saturday evening! It was gorgeous! My only complaint would be the lack of outdoor eating tables....for such a great outdoor space I felt that orders should be able to be taken throughout the courtyard. But it is their soft opening and things that are already great can get awesome with some fine tuning! Can’t wait to enjoy some brunch here one day!</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< date>

Very disappointing. Not the food because we never got to that.
Went with a friend @4:45  to have small plates and drinks. Sat down outside and they brought us menus. We asked about happy hour specials
and were told that it was over in 10 minutes so she couldn’t get our order in on time. Then she asked if we were having dinner or just small plates, because tables are reserved for only those ordering dinner, so she said we’d have to move to the bar which is 6 or 8 seats. Once we got drinks, we were free to move about.  She was not very nice and there were lots of empty tables.
We left.<//review>

Shangri-La makes you feel like you’ve stepped back in time and you get to be fancy for a little while as you enjoy their delicious drinks and food. Their decor has gorgeous teal and gold accents, really fun and funky accessories, and the huge outside patio is to die for! The vibe is extremely welcoming, the staff is very professional and friendly. As for the food, Everything I tried I have really liked. My personal favorites are the brussels sprouts, and the mac & cheese. I really love the Island hopping drink, and the corpse bride drink. They are both so unique, very special flavors I just don’t experience that often, that’s a good thing. We are very lucky because we don’t live too far away, so we can walk over for date night, and we have been doing that quite often lately.</text>

<review>So disappointing...it is a couple of blocks from our house so we had high hopes. Nice job on the decor, but with all the outside seating they need to create shaded areas besides the umbrellas for under our hot California sun. Ordered ribs and carrots, couldn't get the meat off the bone.  Took half the 5 or 6 ribs costing $51 (with no sides or seasoning or sauce) home and cooked them for another 2 plus hours so the meat would come off the bone. Service was slow...the only good thing was the carrots...which were also over priced...< /review>< pics>

<Response>None<//Response><pictures>None<//pictures><Rate>4</Rate><text>Cool venue, with a huge amount of outdoor and indoor places to sit, drink, and have fun with decent albeit inconsistent service.

The food was mostly good, with a lot of interesting options - though getting the food on the table took a long time for the second round, and the slice of avocado on our salad was not in a condition I would ever serve.

We didn't try many of the drinks, but the one my wife had was nice. Our waitress was friendly and popped in often to check on us, but nobody asked if we wanted a refill when my wife finished her drink.

On our way out, three greeters were standing at the front desk. They all looked up and watched us walk out - no "thanks", "have a good night", etc. It was funny and strange, and we had a laugh about it on the way to the parking lot.

Overall, I'm glad we popped in to check out Shangri-la. It's a neat place, and clearly a lot of thought and effort has gone into how the place is put together. We'll be back someday - I hope things are just a little tighter then!</text></record>

I chose Shangri-la for my birthday dinner after reading about it in Sac town magazine. We sat on the patio, fun decor styled after Palm Springs mid-century modern. Friendly service. Food was tasty, large portions served family style. Fun to share meals with everyone at the table. We had the ribs, steak, chicken and salad and milk bread for 4 of us and there was leftovers. One issue was the patio area where our table sat was too small and when my husband pushed his chair to get up the chair legs went in the grass and he tipped over and fell out of the chair. I also was disappointed they didn't offer a small complimentary birthday dessert like many restaurants do.<//review>

<review>Amazing makeover in the heart of Old Fair Oaks. Since the earlier reviews, it appears they have expanded the outdoor seating. Fresh menu. Limited selection, but let's be real. If you want a menu with 43,000 choices, go to Applebee's. I'm only going to order a plate or two off the menu. Did the ribs with an ahi salad starter. Delicious!< /review><rating>5< /rating><gmap_id>0x809add17b543c53d:0xc90069f535a7188d<//gmap_id>< username>

Did not care for recent performers.  Friends and I were disappointed. An awesome group would be the auditors.<//text>

I ordered a fish plate, not knowing that it was a whole fish, and not just a filet. The dish came with the head and tail included, and a whole bunch of sharp little bones to contend with. Overall, very pricey, and not what I am used to.<//text>

I so wanted to like this place ... the temperature was about 100° outside and about 95° inside due to the open air bar and no overhead fans to cool the diners off. There were dozens of flys pestering us while we were eating and landing on our food (my personal pet peeve). I can't imaging how many flys were in the kitchen. Food was pretty tasty, but overpriced for what we got, as menu items are sold a la carte with no accompaniments. Our server suggested we order 6 small plates and 6 dinner items - our party of six's bill over $400, with only 2 cocktails each and no dessert. Craft cocktails were refreshing tho. Might return on a cool day with the hopes the fly problem will be resolved.</Text>

The drinks were named fancy, but were made poorly. The setting is nice, the wait staff is great, but for what it tries to portray they make terrible drinks.<//review>

NEW, LOUD, PRICEY..Good vibe outside, noisy inside,  30% to 50% over priced vs competitors, overall fun, but not a place I'd go to on a regular basis, figure easy $100 per person for dinner, missed the mark for me.</text>

<Text>Wonderful place to hang out with friends and is the perfect place to waste a Sunday afternoon. It is also a great place to bring a first date if you want to get together I the middle of the day. Great atmosphere and a unique menu.< /Text>< Pics>

< review>
I went for the first time, loved the big outdoor area and feel of the space. I really appreciated that as a sober-curious person, there were a couple mocktails on the menu. I opted for the NA mojito, and it was very tasty and served in a fancy glass. Thanks guys! Non drinkers want to have fancy options, too! Service was ok, nothing special, nothing bad. I really liked my fish tacos and the candy bar dessert was sooo good!< /review>

{'time': 1620536939373, 'text': "Hi Jackie, hoping to learn what the issue was? We are a woman owned small business that works tirelessly to keep our guests happy. Even during this pandemic where we are short staffed and working double time to stay afloat. We certainly wish you would have let us know if you had a issue so we could make it better instead of leaving a one star review with no feedback. Doesn't give us much of a chance to make things right, you know?"}< /Response>

Loved this hidden gem of a place.  Food was very fresh, authentic tasting, and with great proportions.  If you're in the mood for some good traditional Chinese Food, I highly recommended place!< /Review>

<response>None< /response><Text>Friendly people. Clean restaurant. Food was very good. I ordered the chicken fried rice and beef & broccoli. Beef was a little pale but it still tasted very good so I still gave it 5 stars. Prices are good for the amount of food you get. Food was made fast. They have parking. I would definitely come back.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

I got beef chow mein. It was flavorless and 95% noodles 3% onions 2% beef. The fried rice sucks. No vegetables in it and also flavorless. Soy sauce packets are impossible to open without scissors. They also gave me a magical fork that disappeared in my car for eternity. To this day I have no idea where that thing is. Had to share a fork with my girlfriend.< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None< /Response><Gmap_id>0x80c2bdff02f05351:0x4d0ffe6adbc5d9fd</Gmap_id></record>

I visit this place a lot since I work nearby. I got to say their customer service is always good and they keep the spot clean regularly. Rates are fair and they serve big portions.</Review>

This place is really good . They use large sized shrimp and don't skimp on any of the proteins as most Chinese places do . I drive from the city to go here and I like supporting small mom & pop operations like this one . I'm glad to see they are staying very busy through Covid and will survive .</Text>

Tiny place but very good food.  Very friendly staff/owners and accommodating.  Big portions and good quity ingredients for the price.  Definitely would come back again if we are in the area.  I had shrimp fried rice and it was really tasty with lots of fresh big prawns but not greasy at all.<//review>

Food was really tasty. Their Orange chicken lunch special for 8 dollars was a great value. I would recommend this place for a casual lunch or dinner. I also ordered a thai iced tea that was really good. Very friendly customer service. I am coming back for sure.< /Text>

< Review>
For 10 years I’ve been ordering the same thing. At this restaurant. 2 egg roll, large Buddha feast with shrimp and a soup. Tonight when I tried to order that I was called a liar by the owner. He, wouldn’t give his name, and said that they’ve  NEVER done only 2 egg rolls  Again, I’ve ordered the same thing for 10 years. They have lost a customer not that they care which is what the owner said to me. Pathetic.</Review>

I have come here over ten years.  It is simple, fast, and has polite service. I gave it 4 stars for being good at what it is.  A tiny, low priced, little strip mall restaurant. Their plate sizes are really generous in relation to the price.  The flavor is cleaner American chinese style.  Not many odd flavors. They have a lot of takeout and pickup so the food moves more than the amount of eat in customers. Ignore the irrelevant 1 star reviews like "I did not get a fork with my delivery".<//Review>

Small place with HUGE flavor we ordered 5 different plates and all of them were delicious... large portions... my girls never really eat much after the 1st serving we end up taking home a doggy bag....but amazingly they even had soup. They cleaned every plate.... I totally am in love with this place and will only eat Chinese food from here on.... great customer service as well...<//Text>

Do not order through the website for pickup!!! They received my order, charged my card but would not process the order saying the company that sent over the order is not affiliated with them, even though it’s on their website. I’m out about $17 due to this, even though I ordered on their website.</review>

Requested lunch items from the menu,  the lady server brought us what she wanted to be able to charge more than lunch prices. Got us the right food but larger portions that cost more. Without us knowing that at the end it would cost us almost double of what we would have spent on lunch items. I WON'T EVER GO BACK THERE. And I will never recommend that place to my friends.< /Review>

<Review>Good food at a great price! Most everything here is around $8. Portion size was good as well. You can order on Yelp for delivery and pickup.
Bonus tip: they are part of Delta Skymiles Dining. So you earn more flyer miles while you eat! :)<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

Ordered food from them. They said they don't take Visa but it took my credit card. Then I called back to see what I can do to get my $ back. She said to call Visa. Then I called the restruant back to see if I could pay cash when they deliver it, and they said yes, andthe man said that was a fake website I ordered online from. It was called Simple Menu. Very strange. If it was a fake website, then how did the lady at the restruant know my phone # and call me right after i ordered the food. It doesn't make sense.<//review>

Great service and food.  Very small so expect to wait if you want a table during lunch if you come at prime time.  Prices are also very affordable and you get plenty.</text>

Took an hour and a half to get food. No chopsticks. No fortune cookies. Forgot my steamed rice. Girlfriend's meal was soggy. On the bright side, the sweet and sour chicken was okay.< /text>

It fed me twice, once w/ a friend so that's THREE full meals, plus it came w/ rice so it probably would have been 4 meals if I'd used the rice! I just had Chinese several blocks away and it didn't come close. I'll be coming back here for sure! But see pix for prices, not their menu.

<review>Order came and we weren't happy that they don't disclose what extras they add to their food.  They wouldn't redeliver food that would not get eaten because they don't disclose that they add things to foods on their menu.  Their customer service sucks ass and cost them a customer... Won't be ordering from here again!< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

<review>Small place average food. mostly heated up items premade sauces and food from a chinese food supply company not a lot of food made in the restaurant. friendly delivery man not so friendly owners in the location especially if you have kids. they seem to dislike kids. if you are looking for cheap chinese takeout of average quality and taste they will work. If you want actual decent chinese food look elsewhere.</review>< Pictures>

It is ho-hum Chinese food. Ordered lunch special with Kung-Pao chicken, which included soup, eggroll & soft drink. I wanted hot-n-sour soup. It was neither hot nor sour. The vegetables in it were extremely under-cooked and it was not even hot, temperature wise. Egg roll was a spring roll with vegetables nearly raw inside. Ordered a diet Coke to drink and realized it tasted more like club soda than a Coke. Kung-Pao  chichken I know is a spicy dish. Their version is NOT. And I am not sure if it is because it is the lunch special but, I had to look for chicken pieces in the mush they served under this name. Fried rice was okay but not much fried with anything. 2 pieces of eggs I was able to find in a pint size bowl of fried rice. I don't believe I will be a regular customer of this joint, even though it is one of the very few places within walking distance from my work.< /text>

This bar is is a perfect place to feel comfortable. if you're into the 90210 atmosphere this isn't the place for you if you're into Johnny the plumber Mike the welder the steve the  local barber,if you're into that type of atmosphere or and  people you can relate to ,this is perfect for you, guaranteed to put   a smile on your face it's a great place to just be you< /Text>

Nice neighborhood bar, friendly patrons and staff. The grub helps ya prolong your stay. You can have lunch  and/or dinner there. Busy place at times. Tippers to the front. Wait time can vary.</review>

Cool decor, pool tables, karaoke, and heavy pouring bartenders... basically a classic dive bar. What makes it hit or miss is the clientele. You can have the raddest night here or the shittiest depending on the crowd. Worth rolling the dice though, I will say that!< /review>

I will never go back and I would never recommend it to anyone.  The service was horrible and the employee was rude and disrespectful to me and my friend. Friday night karaoke ended and they just announced last call at the bar, we ordered our drink and not 5 minutes later the employee is yelling at everyone to leave because they are closed. She told us to take our drinks outside or take it home. She tapped my shoulder in a threatening confrontational manner to ask me to leave while other costumers were still lingering around finishing up there pool game and drinking there last drink. It was 1:30 am and they are suppose to close at 2am. This employee was very rude and disrespectful to me and my friend. We are both older women and this employee was half our age and she called us old hags as we were leaving. This place has no class. It's dirty, and the bathrooms are filthy. Beside for the fact that this employee has a horrible and trashy mouth, the overall atmosphere is not my type of place. Its a Very low class and filthy place. This dive bar makes other dive bars look good. This is truly a dirty, trashy dive bar and the employee fits all the expectations of bad manner and horrible costumer service. This employee was actually threatening me and my girlfriend in a very confrontational manner. Other people actually had to tell her to calm down. .... I am in my 50's and this employee was probably in her young or mid 30's and acting like a high school gang banger. Low class.< /Review>< date>

The bar tendress Brook is prolly the sweetest of her trade Ive ever known. And the fellow patrons were suma the best, most friendliest ive ever known in the 27 years Ive been legal to attend such merry suarets. Great place. Put it on the top of ur list as must BE at-type of places.  And I need not mention, tho Im going to, that what ever they are paying Brooke, the bar tendress, cant be nearly enough.  Tip that lady well or ull go straight to hell. Lol. And if ur from out of town Id recommend above all others that u keep it legal and stay overnight at The Pines Inn right up the street. Ryt around $100 a night but if u avail urself to the wonderful spread they put out for breakfast and truely appreciate suma the finest in accomodations you wont wonder for a moment where the money went. & ull be more than close enuf to cab it affordably to and from sed location.

<review>This is my second time here. The first time i was completely blown away at how perfectly Ray and Sandys Hideaway fit the profile of a dive bar. As me and my date read reviews of the bar while sitting at the bar, we could not hold in our outbursts of laughter.
I ordered a bottle of coors lite and my date ordered a shot of Jager ( totaled less than $10) as my date took shot after shot, so did our petite and beautiful Bartender.
You basically need scuba gear because this a deep sea dive bar. There is no security ( unless you count the tiny female bartender or regular custys that might jump in to stop fights)
The kitchen is located directly in the bar( btw the bartender is also the cook)
The best part is the Decor! As you walk in you see outdated beer promotions all over the walls which are wood on one side and brick on the other. The owner has a very "tasteful" velvet nude painting of herself that favors the classic Jesus with Thorns paintings you can find in most pisa grandma houses along with their plastic covered couches located next to the Bitchen (Bar and Kitchen)
The ceiling tiles are artistic with what i assume to be personal peices of art work from regular customers. Consider it the dive bar Sistine Chapel.
I could go on and on but i conclude with giving this bar 5 stars. If you want to get drunk, sing and hear bad kareoke in your pajamas this is the place to go. I Love It. Cheap Drinks, Bad food, Drunk Staff and Guarenteed STDs if you sit on their toilet seats... Our Kinda Place ( Dont sit, Squat)< /review>< pics>

<text>FIRST TIME EATER!

Went on a work lunch with 2 other amazing ladies to Sushi Yama today - first time ever going here even though its literally walking distance from my office. However I will TOTALLY be back.

We had amazing service from Amber. She was super attentive and nice, quick, efficient and catered to any request we had.

The food was AMAZING! I eat pretty healthy and so I am always aware that I could easily eat 15 sushi rolls and be stoked about it but I need to be strategic.

Their menu is online and was available for me to check out prior to arriving. I knew exactly what I wanted and it came out even better than I anticipated.

I am not sure why I haven't been there before but it will definitely be a return.

It was so delicious I literally just asked my husband if he wanted to go tonight on a date night!

5 out of 5 would definitely recommend!

- Masks to and from tables
- Casual environment
- Will be an epic summer eatery as they keep it really cold in their due to food that they serve (I recommend a jacket if you run cold)
- No outside smokers air comes in
- Split tab friendly
- Great service
- Very reasonably priced
- Indoor and patio seating
- Attached parking lot (its across the street from City Hall's larger lot)</text><user_name>Jessamyn Patterson< /user_name></record>

We are relatively new to eating sushi and used a Groupon to try it out. Our waitress, Tala, was sweet, patient and helpful. The sushi was excellent as was the service. Not only will we be going back, we will bring others and be recommending Sushi Yama!<//review>

<Text>Solid and tasty sushi joint, have been here many times. Great offering, great staff, great service. Carlsbad roll is definitely my favorite. Amongst many sushi places in North county these guys are definitely above average. Will continue to order from them. Take out or dine in, I'm never disappointed.< /Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPRCd2xdMP2VtgvsOwLLFSJRRJEpyksXY7Tz4ry=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNH3Ld2odsV3uiqBEmc_f8FeglYAJQSXU7JeaaQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures>< Resp>

<Review>So happy they are back open for indoor dining. The stuffed jalapenos, Chronic and protein rolls are must try! All the food is great but those are my fav. They also have delivery through doordash and you can even get adult beverages delivered. All in all a staple in North County for sushi!!< /Review><Date>1618608016582< /Date><Response>None< /Response>< Pics>

They automatically add the gratuity, to your check of 20% which I think is wrong! Especially when the service is poor! Did not have a good first experience<//review>

They even charged .50 cents for sriracha sauce on a to go order? I'm sorry Sushi Yama, but you have lost your authenticity. I would rather go to Costco and buy their frozen Japanese food because at least I know they are consistent.< /Text><user>102310773026311192350</user></record></dataset><record>

I went to Sushi Yama on January 18, 2021. I ordered 2 Chapulín rolls for my family and I. Up until Saturday we were sick with food poisoning. At first we thought it was COVID, because of the similar symptoms but once we received our negative test results we knew it was the food. I would like that a refund be issued at the very least but when I call the store manager is never available. I even emailed them Jan 26th and nobody has gotten back to me. I attempted to leave my information but they would not take down my information as I was told I would need to speak to the manager directly. I was told he comes in during the afternoons and when I called Friday he was not there yet. Hopefully now that I am writing this they will get back to me.< /Text>

This place has terrible customer service. Stay away. I ordered through door dash and they canceled my order 3 hours later saying they were too busy to fulfill the order. Left their phone off the hook as well so no phone orders.< /Text>

<text>I came here 01/09/21 ( my birthday) and noticed that there were no signs to indicate social distancing so people like myself and Grubhub and Postmates were all pretty close together waiting on orders. I put my order in at 4:57PM, received it at 6:00PM. I was told it would take no more than 45 minutes to complete. They had no Mackerel, Ikura, as well as a couple others I can’t quite recall. The bill was over $100. People that were picking up food with there cars, well one of them bumped me with their car, didn’t think to ask me if I was alright. This place is awful. On top of it all someone thought I was yelling at them. I wasn’t.<//text><Time>1610960829278< /Time><userid>118000337237000092852<//userid></record></dataset><record>

I ordered through Uber Eats. After 35 minutes of the order saying "making your order" i called Sushi Yama to make sure they got it. It had been sitting ready for over 20 minutes. Uber Eats couldnt find a driver to pick it up. I told her that i was concerned about the quality of one item and that i didnt want it to be mushy. It was remade for me so it would be fresh! That is Grade A customer service.<//review>

So disappointed with this place I ordered in online at 5:17pm  and I wait for my order it wasn’t ready until 7:10pm waiting for just calamari plus then I get it and it was over cook 😡😡😡😡 I believe the if they are busy they shouldn’t take anymore orders on the phone  so people don’t have to wait so long
Plus a customer order  after me she knew one of the serve and give her her food fast
This is not right I wont order again<//Review>

Waited an hour and 10 minutes for my order. Finally left. We counted 15 people standing outside waiting. I'm only giving 2 stars since the place looks popular but without eating the food, does it really matter? I'm negative 23 dollars now due to buying a Groupon before arriving.<//text>

The real question to wrestled with here is, how much arrogance, chaos and disrespect will you take to get good sushi? Because make no mistake, you are getting all three at sushi yama.

They actively sell a Groupon but it only applies to dine in and they don’t honor it for take out, which is all they offer.

Rest assured, they do a high volume of business and that only reinforces all the bad things about sushi yama. Nothing will change anytime soon.< /review>

Fun environment with attentive staff. Everything came out of the kitchen quickly and was plated beautifully. The bento box I ordered tasted great, and the sushi rolls my wife ordered were just as good. Good pricing on food, high quality tasting ingredients. I definitely recommend you try this place out, we had a great time.</Text>

<text>Great sushi in my own backyard. For the longest time I've been driving down to SD for good sushi not knowing that Sushi Yama had tasty food. Me and my wife will on a Friday night and was greeted with friendly staff. I was amazed at how quickly our sushi was served also how great it tasted.
The only downside to this location is the parking. There's limited parking and the spot were tight. Other than that the establishment is nice and clean and looks to bring in all types of people.<//text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO_3dKrBh4mCvo9VIvD_NtTtKuyFsA7dJvgO8EO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP5mHGV3kkh0h4Lj9ZV8rcet-sprnypGEKXmoF7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics>< Response>

The roll I ordered was so loosely wrapped I had to use a spoon to eat my roll. It was good... the mixed tempura was good although the sweet potatoes were crisp and not cooked through. Our waitress was awesome! I have been here before so I'm hoping they just had an off night😬</review>

Amazing service! They are always willing to accommodate if you have an allergy or aversion to certain ingredients. The staff is always friendly and the fish is always fresh. The sushi chefs know exactly what they are doing, making the food even better! The atmosphere is calm and relaxing, perfect for dates or business. And did I mention the mochi ice cream and creme brulee?! One of my favorite gems in escondido. 10/10 O always recommend!</review>

< Review>
So I figured posting a review would be less of ordeal and scene than going in and talking to the manager but my goodness was this awful sushi after spending $62 on 4 rolls.
For starters I was shorted a roll on a to-go order. So there goes a expensive meal. The sushi rolls had dry sticky rice and who knows how old the fish was being bland and dry.

Awful, just absolutely awful.< /Review>

We really like their large variety of quality sushi rolls here. We like to buy 5 different rolls and share them between 4 of us. Dragon and crunchy rolls are 2 of our favorites here.</review>

So far my favorite Sushi place in Escondido. The Escondido crunchy roll is my favorite. I've eat in there and service was great. I've called ahead and ordered for take out too. I need to try some other menu items but just writing about this makes me want a Escondido crunchy roll!<//review>

The variety of sushi rolls they have is great....so many delicious ones to choose from and the names are fun. I wasn't as pleased with the "grilled" sea bass appetizer because it really wasn't grilled. It was also over seasoned, but other than that I enjoyed everything else.</Review>

Food was great, like the atmosphere. But service was pretty weak. Our mouths were on fire from the spicy rolls we got with habanero, and the server was nowhere to be seen as our drinks ran out< /Review>

14 $ Rainbow Roll was worth it. The middle fresh and the fish was fresh. I ordered on the phone to go. Was ready for pick in less then 15 min. Everbody was so sweet to me. I went on St Patrick day at night. I wish they had reservations. I have not ate in so i cant comment on that yet.<//Text>

Sushi Yama is our Go To place for Date Night. The food is always good and the place has a friendly, energetic vibe. We've been Sushi Yama regulars for about 6 years and it's never let us down. For something fun try the Sunday Brunch buffet.< /review>

<Text>Enjoyed an evening meal with friends at this Escondido sushi restaurant; which I am ashamed to say I haven't tried until now. But I will be back. Interesting special rolls including two rolls without rice for those of us watching our carbs....Sashimi Q (rice less)- yellowtail, salmon, spicy tuna, avocado and crab wrapped in a thin layer of cucumber and the Protein roll.<//Text><name>Mateo Dávalos< /name>< Gmap_id>

Tried ordering online through door dash confirmed my order just to cancel it shortly after. Can't even call into the location to find out why it was cancelled. Last time I use this location since they can't even let you know what's going on.</Review>

Jessica and Hollie are awesome.  As usual, the team here makes me feel welcome, and the food is great!  I'm down 8lbs since going Sushi instead of fast food.  The service here is always fast anyway.  Thanks guys!  You Rock!!!</Review>

<Name>Kent Carruthers</Name><Text>Dropped in here on a whim and was very pleasantly surprised.  The sushi was very good, fresh and big rolls. Really liked the albacore special roll, delicious.  A large number of the speciality rolls are 50% off if you dine in which makes them about $6 to $7 per roll, what a great deal.  We'll definitely be back.<//Text>< date>

<Rate>1< /Rate><Review>This review is strictly based on the delivery experience. Placed order on Doordash for delivery with estimated delivery time of 45-50 minutes. Driver arrived and waited for the order (as was indicated on Doordash progress) and after 25 minutes eatimated delivery time changed to 87 minutes! I called restaurant and asked about that and was told restaurant was too busy! But then why mislead those ordering delivery with the wrong time?! Extremely, unhappy with the experience and hostess casually admitting that wait time changed!</Review>< Pictures>

<Text>I'm pretty understanding considering I work in the industry; However, tonight I was blown away by the horrible customer service. I first ordered two rolls which the server rang one of them up wrong. No biggie I just waited while they fixed it. I took a couple bites and got a fish bone stuck in my gum so I told the server I would pass on the roll and if I could please get my check. As she went to the back, I stacked the plates because that is something I always do to help the servers clean up the table and prebus. They took the plates to the back and I could hear them asking each other if they seen anything. Sure enough one of the girls brought out the stack of plates and it's dropping on the floor and asked me to look for the bone.😂 I was in disbelief like are you really questioning my statement? Anyway I asked for the manager and he was just as rude. They didn't care to understand my point about customer service. Very upsetting feeling like you are being accused of lying.</Text></record>

This place has all of my favorite rolls. Great tempura rolls. Delicious, fresh spicy tuna. And the Orange County Roll was especially tasty since I’m fond of citrusy flavors. The tempura ice cream was a fun dessert to split with my date. The wait staff was attentive, and service was fast. Great food for a fair price! We will return again.< /Review>

Wonderful sushi rolls! Great deals on half price rolls.  My husband and I stop in whenever we're in town. We normally start with crispy calamari and half house salads. My faves are the Escondido and Ya Jealous rolls. The cold appetizer, tuna tartar served with wontons is beyond yummy. I also love the Hot Pot (broiled fish in an amazing sauce)!< /text>

< Review>
Not that great and not a good value. I paid $4.50 for garlic edemame that was NOT GOOD. I had to fix it myself at home. The roll I ordered was barely cut properly because pieces were stuck together. The waitress gave me water with something floating in it. When I asked for a new water she looked at me like I was asking too much. Then I watched as a few employees discussed the water issue. After they took 7 minutes to bring me a new water, I didn’t trust to drink it. Getting food from here made appreciate Umai Sushi soo much more. Btw the manager was standing in front on his cell phone. I wouldn’t go back.<//Review>

Good service and a unique cast of rolls I've never seen before. I had the some what mysterious "kitchen sink" roll and was not disappointed! Their sushi is always over all quite good!<//review>

< review>
Very nice sushi restaurant in Escondido. Appreciated the service the most but the food was good and they offered 50% off rolls. We started with the Pan Fried Gyozs which is basically dumplings with sesame ponzu which came out fast and was so good!!

For rolls we got a bunch and they were all good!!! We got the (1) Escondido (my favorite) which was shrimp tempura, crab, cucumber, tuna, salmon, eel, avo, topped with spicy aioli, eel sauce, & potato crunches; (2) The Centipede which was shrimp tempura, spicy tuna, cucumber, topped with avocado & balsamic glaze; (3) Orange County which was spicy crab, cucumber, topped with salmon, avocado, and yuzu essence, and finally a standard crunchy roll which was shrimp tempura, crab, cucumber, tempura flakes and soy glaze

If I had any complaint it would be that the rolls weren't rolled very well so they fall apart big time but the taste, service, and reasonable price will get me to go back there<//review>

<text>I gave it 4 because the staff is SO rude! However, they have lots of permanently half price rolls. They're super tasty and I've never been sick from eating there. They desperately need to update their patio and they don't open the patio until the dinner rush. So if u go there right when they open, they probably won't let you sit out there.<//text></record>

I've been coming here for over two years now. Love the food. Occasionally it is slow going but on the whole the wait staff has been great. Last time we ate dinner there we met the owner and he was very friendly. I am going with a group of 10 friends this Sunday before we see a show at the arts center. Should be a great night.<//text>

<text>My husband and I discovered this spot a while back. Started out going to the Escondido location and here and there we also frequent the Carlsbad location. Fish is always fresh and they're pretty good about the consistency of their recipes. Only thing that isn't consistent is the service. We've waited up to 45min before getting our food at the Escondido location. And forget the pleasantries if you're ordering over the phone for pickup. In other words sit at the bar given the option, the chefs there are usually always on top of their game.<//text>< Rating>

I am the host of Sushi Smackdown TV Show and events. I travel from city to city to find the best sushi restaurants to recommend and hold events. If you haven't experienced Sushi Yama yet, I highly recommend you too. I have tasted more sushi than the average sushi lover because of my show. Sushi Yama is truly a fantastic sushi restaurant.< /Text>

<Review>Got very sick, food poisoning, for 3 full days, was so weak could hardly move.  came in to talk to manager, not there.  Left 4 messages over a 4 day period for a call-back, no phone calls.  Plus this one waitress was very unpleasant, maybe because I asked her to wipe down the table better, she made me feel like I was doing something wrong just sitting there.  Other younger ones are more joyful and polite.<//Review>< Pics>

This place is really a hit or a miss. Some days the food is amazing others it is bad. The taste is good but there is no quality control. Rolls fall apart before you can get it in your mouth. The fried rice has massive blotches of unseasoned white rice in it.</review>

Loved the sushi! Super fresh and tasty, unique menu w different types of rolls and other Japanese style cuisine there. Me and my friend had a wonderful ladies nite there. We also partook in some bubble delicious cold sake! It was a very fun nite. Loved the atmosphere of the place. Very chill. Nice and clean. The service was awesome. Loved the staff there! They had great recommendations for sushi to eat.</text>

Really good sushi, but bad tempura(tried twice, both times soggy), and I would say I have some kind of issue with Sushi Yama's customer service 80% of the time I visit. The issues span from hostess attitude to extremely slow service, to not answering the phone for customer calls. Not big enough problems to stop coming in because the location is convenient, but also nothing I would drive any distance to dine.<//text>

Been there in the past and the food is great but the service is horrible. Staff was rude, we walked out and went somewhere else because of that. We will never go there again</Review>

This is one of our go-to Sushi Bars.  They have great food and reasonable prices.  Check out their 1/2 price portion of the menu - the first four rolls are excellent!   You won't get warm fuzzies from the staff, but then again you can't have everything!</review>

Should be less than 5 stars since our order took a lot longer than it should, but other than that, we liked the food, and they gave us free dessert since it was my birthday so they pretty much redeemed themselves.<//Text>

Service was poor. Menus just shoved in our face with no words said. The green tea tasted like dirty feet. Food was overpriced for such a small run down place. Small portions. Don't waste your money or time at this place.<//text>

< Review>
Service was not very good. Parking is bad. Portions are huge. It tastes pretty good. Not very traditional, or made traditionally. I sat at the counter.  If you are looking for someone with the traditional 7 years sushi rice training, this is not the place. I really doubt it. The gentleman use plastic wrap to shape their sushi roles. They forgot one of our roles and served it a good 20 minutes after we finished our others. I asked for my check when food was delivered. took another 10 minutes to give it to me AFTER we finished eating. We were going to the theater afterwards. I dinno. If you are a teenager or a drunk person and want a fun place to hang, cool. The atmosphere was cool. It has value. My 16 year son thought it was good. He enjoyed himself.</Review>

<Response>None<//Response><text>I eat here all the time, and the food is pretty good. But the service has turned to crap. I waited 20 minutes without a single acknowledgement, the only reason I didn't leave sooner was because my husband wanted sushi. When we finally did get acknowledged, she took our order and left us sitting there forever. Disappointed in the service. Sat there for a half hour and didn't even get my food, so we just left.</text>< GmapID>

BUT, the quality of the sushi brought it back to 4.  They have Groupons almost everday and the quality of the food is worth the visit.  Expect to pay a decent amount if you don't have a coupon BUT, the food makes up for it in a HUGE way.   Great place to visit as this is one of our go-to spots for Sushi in Escondido.</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

<Review>Would have loved to eat here, but I called to place an order for takeout and was told that they were kind of busy and that "I'm the only server here."  I asked whether they have any lunch specials and was told go to the website and look at two star menu items... okay fine...

So I did, and called back and was told that specials are for dine in only.  Guess I won't be eating here ever!!!  and as far as I'm concerned they don't have time to help customers nor are they trained on proper etiquette on the phone.  I will go to one of the other 5 Sushi restaurants in Escondido and gladly spend my money there.

Thanks for nothing!<//Review>< Pictures>

I've gone there several times and I always enjoy the food, normally they are good about serving us. Today it took way too long before someone rushed over (not at a busy hour either) to get our orders, someone who was busing tables was watching the tv. I finished my roll and my friend offered me one of hers, I took it and found what I believe to be mouse poop on it. My friend is sensitive so I said nothing of it, I would like to have the health department go look at the restaurant...as we were leaving there was a dead cockroach in the fountain.<//text>

< Review>
Been coming here for years. The food is always excellent the service is the only reason this doesn't get the fifth star. The service is not consistent, usually with the waitresses not being attentive, and long wait times. The price is great for the quality of food, worth the wait and shoddy service.< /Review>

<time>1513831834826< /time><review>Everything was subpar. Ordered a 70.00 take out order and when I arrived, the wait staff had me sitting and waiting an extensive amount of time even though my order was ready.  Plus they still forgot shrimp sauce even though I asked multiple times to ensure it was in the bags.  The rolls tasted ok, but were made horribly and didnt stay together.  The miso soup and spicy calamari was awesome though, so they get a star for that alone. Honestly, I expected much more.

<Review>I check their website to see if they allowed dogs and they do in the patio area, so we called to make sure and they said yes.  when my girlfriend and I arrived there, the stupid guy said that he wasn't going to open the patio just for us because work was slow that day. We though it was F**king rude and Lazy so we went to a different sushi place near the Escondido movie theater,  the lady was kind and told us that they didn't allowed pet but since it was very slow she was ok with it. So shushi yama  you need better staff that fallows your own rules n regulations.</Review>< response>
