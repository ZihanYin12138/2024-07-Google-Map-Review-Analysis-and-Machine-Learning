<Text>Awesome teamwork! I had my covid hair, 10 inches long taken down to 1.5-3" by Miriam and wanted it shorter after I left. Next morning Gloria stepped up Miriam was booked, to dial it in for No Charge! Great job by both ladies to hook me up. Big tips for all !< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

This is the only place I will go to get my hair cut! Most of the staff does a great job. There is only older lady who doesn't cut very well but I avoid her. They are very fast, even when the waiting room is full. They offer a scalp massage too which feels really good. They use some type of mint shampoo that makes your head feel amazing. I am always in and out quickly and enjoy my time here. They play really good music too!</Text>

Don’t ever buy any product for 2 reasons:
1st. They’re used by the workers for few times (20%), and then they put it back in the shelf for sale.
2nd. They’re very pricey and not worth. Specially the purple shampoo it will make your hair fall out.

The workers there demand HIGH tip. Basically $4 is not enough. They want percentage, so if you make my mistake and buy that shampoo after you get a hair cut and color, the hair stylist wants 15%, 25%, or more.

The quality of the work is not worth the high  prices. I don’t recommend this place. The only good worker is a tall white lady with short hair cut. She’s very professional and super nice.<//Text>

There were two or three attendants able to take the walk in appointment. Also, the wait was as soon as information exchange was complete. Courteous and comunicative with customer. I liked.</Text>

Chain hair salon. Can't speak for woman's cuts,  colors or styles but they do a nice men's cut and beard trim. Tiffany,  who I used today did exactly what I asked for.  She's a sweet gal,  does a great job. I will use her from now on,  highly recommend her.< /Text>

I hadn't had a cut or a trim in almost a year, I took in some photos of how I wanted my hair and Tiffany talked me through the cut and made me feel at ease, I cut off at least 5 inches of hair. We had good conversation and she is really sweet! I absolutely LOVE my hair, she did a fantastic job. Everyone I encountered was so nice and it seemed like the other people there were all returning customers. I will definitely return here.< /review><name>Natalie Camacho< /name><userid>104235355243247979405</userid></record>

The quality of this place depends on the person who you get to do your hair, truly. I think that pretty much goes for every salon. I have always gone here to get my hair cut because of the convenience of its location. Normally the quality is just good, and I just went back today for a hair trim and eyebrow touch-up, and they gave me excellent service. Basically, the people there (today) were very friendly and didn't cut any corners (pun intended) with doing their job. You can't really judge the entire salon based off of one time going there. That's one stylist in probably about 8-15 stylists. In the past, normally the service was about 3.5 to 4 stars, and today I'd definitely give it 5 stars. So that's my opinion. Take it or leave it.< /Review>

Finally a time my daughters doing well I can go get a cut. Put in my name and was told wait was 45 minutes. Come back after 45 minutes and they tell me there is still a 30 minute wait. After driving back and forth with my medically fragile child to finally get my hair cut I had to leave again with no cut. I will not be back.< /text>

I cannot say enough good things about this place. The food is great, staff is friendly and the seating area is clean.
Parking is a bit tricky so be aware when going.
They also take orders ahead of time to avoid waiting.
I can't wait to go back! 🐔< /text>

Absolutely delicious chicken. Tried the "Hot wings" and "Honey Bee wings". I will definitely be coming back.

Decent amount of seating for the small size of the restaurant. The staff was attentive and friendly.

Parking lot is a bit tight and weirdly shaped, but the food makes it worth it.<//review>

<review>I have been a loyal customer for years. Most of the time they do not have many items listed on their physical in store menu available to order and I’ve come to accept that because the chicken is good and it was clear that is just how they do things there . The staff is friendly generally, sometimes short and to the point but most of the time they are welcoming and friendly. Today was not the case. After I had to make a complete different order due to them not having the tenders that I tried to order I was not treated with any courtesy or politeness when I arrived to pay $12 for half of a chicken and left $3(2.92) tip. When I realized I didn’t get some pickled radish(normally I do) I asked for them. All of a sudden it was like I was asking for the keys to the safe. An issue was made about paying for them because they “aren’t free” when you only buy half of a chicken. I agreed to pay.  After having 10 seconds to think about it I declined and walked out. She clearly couldn’t look past giving a loyal customer .20 worth radish that didn’t get what they wanted in the first place. And all with out any human emotion. The Chicken Isn’t That Good. Hope those precious radish stay fresh for paying customers. It’s not about the money or the food. It’s about the way it happened.  Bye</review><Rate>2< /Rate><name>J Willing</name>< Pics>

Its sooo good.  My hubby introduced me to this little korean chicken place, right across kaiser on pch in harbor city.  Great find.  I have only had a few of the flavors but if anyone wants a great spicy, crispy fried in, not gooped on chicken wing (and drumsticks), order the hot and crispy.  Its plenty hot and im vietnamese so im saying its good enough for me.  I tried 3 other flavors but this is the one i go back to...worth it.</Review>

<rating>1<//rating><text>I went here last week and received excellent customer service. They forgot to give me the sauce I ordered. No big deal, since I work down the street. I went back, they apologized and even offered me a bottle water.
I went today and the service was terrible. Right in the middle of me ordering. The person that worked there today, picks up the phone and takes the phone order. She even deleted my order to put the order  in. I told her what she did was rude. And left. I will not be back.<//text><name>Shanicka Gardiner< /name><gmap_id>0x80dd35f50ce5bf35:0x9f044d35ff3c6594</gmap_id><Time>1591664265267</Time><Resp>None</Resp></record>

Service was great! But the food was very average, bland, nothing special. I've had really great/authentic and tasty Korean chicken wings with their homemade radish and all their sides-ABSOLUTELY FELL IN LOVE WITH THEIR FOOD - but unfortunately this place didn't even come close to what I've had. But great service, clean restroom and dining area.< /text>

<rating>1< /rating><text>I  called to order chicken and I forgot the flavors that I want . I spoke to this rude and arrogant claiming to be the manager, he wasn’t NOT helpful at all , I came and told him my opinion but instead of apologizing he said” do you want to pay your order?” In a very rude way. I couldn’t have cancelled my order but that’s for my kids dinner.  The chicken wasn’t good like before,
The owner is a lot more friendlier., that’s why he the owner and he is just a so called manager.  He was argumentative to me being his customer which is very bad for  the business .
No more Kokio for me .  Too bad .  BAD SERVICE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!< /text></record></dataset><record>

<rate>2< /rate><Review>Staff friendly but food inconsistent. First time around, I ordered the Cajun wings which was a rub versus breaded and they were good, not spicy enough, but evenly cooked and crispy. I ordered them a second time and they were breaded with a sauce mixed in. The wings were not crispy or evenly cooked and it's possible they reused a crispy chicken wing order and just tossed in the sauce because of the taste. It was way different. They didn't taste fresh like the first time around. I also ordered some waffle fries that were super greasy and soggy. To top it off, some fries were still frozen. I live close enough but wasn't worth the trouble returning the order. If you do order from this place, check your food before leaving.</Review>< Response>

<Review>The chicken at the place is so great!  Korean style fried chicken.  Definitely worth a try.  We tried four of the types of wings.  The Garlic Wings, Sweet and Spicy Wings, Hot Wings, and the Honey Bee Wings.  My favorite had to be the Honey Bee wings.  It has a little bit of a kick, but tastes so good! They are all really great!  The wings are made right when you order them, so the come hot, crispy, and juicy!  Will definitely be coming back again soon!  So happy one opened up so close!<//Review>< resp>

<Text>I fell in love with Kokio in Cerritos and got myself hyped up finding out there is one closer to me in Harbor City!!
Then my excitement only left me with disappointment :/

CHICKEN:
- Half & Half ($20.50)
- Honey Bee: THIS IS THEIR SPECIALTY! Honestly with so many KFC (Korean Fried Chicken) shops around, this is what sets themselves apart. However, the flavor fell incredibly short to the Cerritos location - less crispy, less juicy, not as sweet.
- Hot Crispy: Original crispy but (barely) hot. This was super crispy but maybe too much flour/breading? It took me a couple bites to actually bite into the chicken.

SERVICE:
- There was only one server, which makes sense because it's more of a to-go shop. We were the only dine-in customers but he did a real good job serving us while taking care of phone/to-go orders
- Not sure what was going on but we started to hear loud yelling inside the kitchen (restaurant is quite small and we were sitting directly facing the kitchen). Seemed like the manager/owner was also involved but the yelling continued with cursing as well... it was to the point I was distracted in our conversations. This was a very uncomfortable experience at a small restaurant...

TIPS:
- Parking in the shared plaza (quite small and sketchy)
- No alcoholic drinks... which is usually a staple to KFC
- Maybe sit at the far ends (TV/kitchen can be distracting) or just order to-go

I know Kokio is good... this location is still new and need some improvements. So so sad to say but I would probably visit other OC locations in the meanwhile.< /Text>< time>

<text>(Translated by Google) A decent house with Korean chicken in the Torrance Lomita area. The original original Crispy is ok and the other menu is not bad. Korean male boss is also kind. The location is also far from other Korean businesses in Lomita, so there are many Hispanic customers.

(Original)
토렌스 로미타 지역에서 한국식 치킨으로 꽤 괜찮은 집. 기본인 오리지널 크리스피가 괜찮고 다른 메뉴도 나쁘지 않음. 한국인 남자 사장님도 친절한 편이다. 위치는 로미타에서도 다른 한인 비지니스들과 좀 떨어져 있어 히스패닉계 손님이 많은 편.</text>< Pics>

Very nice, friendly and welcoming staff named Rose. She is amazing and very respectful! I also like the Xiao long bao and the shrimp dumpling. New staff named William is also good. I highly recommend this place. I give it a 4 stars!!!< /Text>

<Text>Wow, they served dim-sum all day!  And they cooked them fresh after I placed the order.  Shrimp xiu mai & har gao were jumbo sizes.
The $26 Lobster Noodles tasted great...very meaty.  And the noodle was firm w/ the right spice.
This is a high end Chinese restaurant - on the pricey side.  It is located on the 3rd flood.  Many other restaurants are on that floor also.<//Text><time>1547790575684</time><rate>4<//rate><user>101065545822141277880< /user><gmap_id>0x80dd2b1fd4b2c9eb:0xca23fbf08e3af737</gmap_id><resp>None</resp><name>Tim Tanda<//name></record>

< Review>
Ordered a sampler: The ribs were dry, salty, and tough. Duck was also very salty and it comprised of tiny rib shards and duck spine bones. Shrimp and walnut was very oily, but a generous amount of walnuts. Only redeeming portion of the meal was the dumplings which were quite delicious.</Review>

Spacious seatings indoor and outdoor bring flexibility for customers. It locates in the complex brings in the convenience. Food is good but more on eating and hanging out experience than on focusing on taste. Sauces taste very nice for not too salty and flavorful. Service is amazing, very quick and care for their customers.

Highlights of the menu:
1. House xiao long bao
2. Sample siu mai with 5 flavors: truffles, uni, fish eggs, pork, and shrimp
3. Salted egg steam buns
4. Dumplings</Review></record>

Very nice restaurant, unfortunately the food wasn't very good. Any hole in the wall Chinese restaurant in Monterey Park or Alhambra would be better. I think they forgot to put salt in the chicken soup, it had no flavor at all.</review>

<Review>I came here on a Sunday afternoon with the lady, after I was told that this place had some fairly good reviews despite being quite a new location in the heart of Buena Park.

It was quite empty on a Sunday afternoon, as we came in minutes after opening time, at 11:40.  The restaurant got very busy and packed after we were seated so good thing we placed our orders in early.  Initial service was fine--waiter Khang took our orders and offered some of his recommendations--we basically filled out the dim sum menu card.  To be honest, prices are much higher than average dim sum restaurants but then again, its cleanliness and bright atmosphere makes up for the price.

We ordered the following: 4 PCS of pork xiu mai, 4 PCS of jumbo har gao, steamed fish, spicy string beans, and a bowl of jasmine rice.

The pork xiu mai was just delicious--had a very mouth-watering taste and didn't feel oily or fatty at all. The aftertaste was just perfect, and the dipping sauce made it a great mixture.  The har gao was excellent--again, rich in flavour, and the size of the shrimp was humongous.  My personal favourite was the steamed fish--had great garlic flavoured sauce with chopped onions.  The aftertaste of the fish felt great--just tasty and mouth-watering--a definite must if you're a fish lover.  The spicy stringed beans were good, but in my opinion, was a tad bit overcooked.

I would come back again, but it's only if I feel like splurging on a nice luncheon on occasion only.  A regular dim sum lunch with these items totalling to $34 seems a bit steep in my opinion.

Overall grade: A-<//Review>< name>

My partner and I came here with high hopes and unfortunately were thoroughly disappointed with all of the meals we received and the service as well. First off the waiter did not put in any effort to be cordial or helpful and in fact seemed to be in a rush despite us being the only customers in the restaurant at the time. When he did answer questions it was muffled and brief, making us feel like he just wanted to take our orders and leave. Moreover the cups provided for our beers were very dirty and lacked even a basic rinse. Finally when we had eaten the mediocre food items there was one item in particular which we wanted to return and remove from the tab due to the fact it didn’t taste good and we’d only had one piece. Still they managed to stoop lower than the crevice we found them cooking out of and denied our request. All in all that restaurant is all show and no qualitative substance. I’ve had better food and service at a gas station.<//text>

<text>Food was subpar-salty and over sauced. Would leave negitive stars if possible. Not a good value for your dollar. Portion sizes very small. Ordered $11.50 BBQ pork, got a nearly empty box of bite sized pieces of pork that you could have probably all fit in my hand, drenched in a watery salty sauce. Didn't even come with rice.< /text>< Pictures>

No one gave us the water, we had to look for it. And the food was not very tasty either. We came here because other places have long queues, I guess there is a reason that this place is so empty.< /Review>< Pics>

<rating>3</rating><text>The interior is pretty and I know the restaurant wants to look expensive and upscale but Chinese food is generally affordable. Everything in the menu should be $3 off because like I said, Chinese food should never be expensive. I ordered the Walnut Shrimp and the name is misleading because it should really be called "Deep fried shrimp with walnuts". The E-fu noodle is tasty but very oily. The Hong Kong Ribs is good but so little meat. The Xiu Mai wasn't good and $7 is way too expensive for only four. Also this place is actually fusion food. Overall, tasty but salty and oily and overly priced.< /text>< pics>

Don’t waste your money.

- Food is bland
- Super expensive
- Not as described on menu

I spent $20 on a vegetarian burrito that didn’t include most of the items it had listed in the description.

Service was also slow considering there was absolutely no one else waiting on their order but me (15+ mins for one burrito).

Would rate 0 stars if possible.< /text>

The bill for a vegetarian plate and a Margarita was almost 40$. For that price, I expected the food to be somewhat decent. WRONG. Quite possibly the worst tasting food I have ever had. It taste like the beans came straight out of a can. No spice or flavor on the rice, and the avocado was gross; most likely store bought in bulk. The only good thing about this place is the older man with the salt and pepper hair, since he made a decent drink. He was also very polite.<//text>

The chips are fantastic, the salsa is okay.  I've eaten here twice passing through LAX.  Chicken tortilla soup was a bit too oily. Today I had the steak burrito and it was good except one of the sections of steak was a little tough and I had to take it out of my mouth.  I would eat here again however.<//text>

Husband is lactose Intolerant and asked staff repeatedly if there was dairy in their burger.  They reassured him he was good, cooked the bun separately but then left the cheese-stuffed pepper in the burger where he ate about half of it before noticing.  When we informed the staff, the employee dismissed our concerns and said "Oh, you'll be fine." Disappointed to be starting a vacation with a sick spouse. We do not recommend this place if you have food restrictions or allergies.<//review>

<Date>1552099258030</Date><rate>1</rate><review>The wait staff (Glenda, Daisy and Jenny) were so focused on the workload of customers they had that they were kicking paid customers out that were waiting on the food that had already been paid for, but not been served. Explained to wait staff that I was going to eat at the restaurant instead of going to my terminal. They continued to badger me to the point that I asked for a refund to give them the table space they were focused on (there were six empty tables, from my quick estimate, about half of the tables in the area that I was sitting).  Advice, focus on rewarding the patience of your customers that are willing to wait the 25 minutes your cook staff was taking, instead of of letting your wait staff run your patrons off because your staff are unhappy with their customer volume.<//review>< Pics>

Had to explain my order to the waiter 3 times and he still screwed it up.  The food proved to be expensive but mediocre.  The waitress chased me out of the restaurant because they mistakenly thought I ordered 'to go'.  Will avoid Border Grill at LAX permanently.< /text>

<Text>I do write positive reviews I promise but unfortunately this is another example of appalling customer service. I could be very descriptive re the staff but won’t and just say avoid dining here unless you want to be spoken to in the rudest manner imaginable. I wasn’t the only one it happened to at the time as the person in front was spoken to in the same way and promptly left the queue as did I. There is a sandwich bar nearby whose name I can’t recall (possibly a Vietnamese name) but the service there was great as was the food.<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

Once I sat in the chair a waiter came over to see if I would like a alcoholic beverage. I declined. I was asked to sit somewhere else and told that the sitting area was designated for drinking patrons. I let him know that I had just ordered a meal. When I asked where I should wait he just shrugged his shoulders! The Food Court was packed so I just stood off to the side. After I received my meal they forgot the rice and beans that come with it. No sense in complaining to the staff. It appears they don’t like the job they are doing anyways. Next time I might try Panda Express.</Review><name>Janice Lea< /name></record>

Fairly quick, but I'd prefer to go hungry next time. We got 1 burger, one nachos, 2 drinks.
They asked me tip them and waitress said thats just how we work... pretty rude, i had to give $5 tip
On statement bill was AUD$105.... very ordinary food... I'd say prob worth AUD$35 biggest rip off.<//Text>

Staff are rude. No tables available so I told them we would eat it at a vacant table at another establishment. When one became available, prior to us getting our order, we moved to it. Rude staff expected us to leave. After paying $40 I sat there and listened to them loudly talk about us. Food wS not even tasty.<//Review>

Horrible Service. Anthony who is working there should be cleaning streets and make LA cleaner from The garbage. Because he is the One!
I simply asked if they are open? He said Let me finish first. I just asked if they are open. Really?

Then he said: I don’t want to Serve you. This is unbelievable!

I would never recommend visiting this place if you are in LA!

Worst experience ever!<//Review>

When you can't deal with another airport burger this is a good option at LAX. I had the rice bowl with pork. Salad wasn't particularly fresh but it was OK. It's not going to blow your mind but the flavours are all there and the menu has some good variety over your other options in the hellish world that is LAX.< /text>

I feel totally ripped off. $78 NZD for two glasses of wine and a quesedilla. PLUS TIP. Ridiculous.

I put $2 tip for my bill that was $16.37, but later noticed on my credit card statement that they overcharged the tip and increased it to $8. I usually put the total amount and have the copy of receipt which is 18.37, but they charged me $24.37. I’m just writing this for other folks to know what might happens to them.< /Text>

I was teetering between a 2 or 3 star rating so I'll let you decide with this review...

The food. It was good. I ordered the steak tacos. Steak was flavful, huicy, and tender. But it onlyocame with 2 street sized tacos? Usually there's at least 3 in combo meals and for the price I paid, I would expect 3 at the very least. It came with a side of two different styles of rice and beans.

The service. I can't remember the guys name but he was great! He had a full bar and was attentive to everyone. As my beer dwindled down, he was quick to offer another one. That to me is a fantastic bar tender.

Would I be back? Eh, due to the prices, no.< /text>

Good food for the airport. Prices a little more reasonable than others.
Great Caesar salad with interesting ingredients, $9. Good pork burrito with solid ingredients for 9.50.</Review>

Hello, I had a very bad experience in this bar on the 21 of April in the evening on the way back home. I'm 13 week pregnant and I sat with my other son at one of their free tables while my husband was buying me a cold drink in the bar. The person from their company came to me and ask me to leave. When I said to her I'm pregnant and feel very bad she just laughed at me. In my opinion that was not human !!! :( Of course I left and will not recommend that place to anybody.< /review>

<review>Waited to be served for quite some time then told they don’t do bar service and to go to the waitress. I went to the waitress and then she said she doesn’t serve our table. No one could explain why and it left me so frustrated. Not good service at all. Ended up leaving.<//review></record></dataset><record>

The citrus chicken burrito was surprisingly delicious and very satisfying. At $9.50 plus tax it was a bit overpriced, but I found this restaurant to be one of the more affordable options on this terminal.</Text>

(Translated by Google) From the Japanese point of view, isn't the taste required anywhere? In particular, airport prices are high in every store (⌒-⌒;) and, of course, the customer service is more than that of a Japanese restaurant.

Again, because I drink a beer for about $ 11, I feel better to drink lightly to kill time. I had to stay long because the transit time was too long, but when I thought it was around ¥ 2500 in Japanese yen with two glasses of beer, I could endure until I got on, and I could laugh at Starbucks

If you have a seat at the counter, you can relax by yourself, or if you have a few, you can watch it on the TV.

(Original)
日本人からすると、どこも味は求められないかも？特に空港価格、どのお店も高いですね(⌒-⌒; )また接客サービスも、日本の飲食店さんに比べたら言うまでもなく、、、。

ここも、ビール一杯飲んで$11くらいはしますから、、、時間つぶしに、軽く飲むくらいが良い気がします。乗り継ぎ時間が開き過ぎたので結局長居しましたが、ビール二杯で日本円で¥2500前後と思うと、、、乗るまで我慢してスターバックスでも良かったかも苦笑

カウンター席なら1人でまったりちょい飲みか、数人ならテレビを見ながらフランクにワイワイ、な使い方でどうぞ！</text>

(Translated by Google) The worst service in the world. Unfriendly, messy, without staff and not to wash glasses, they give you plastic cups for your beer. The blonde lady should take more antidepressants, the ones she takes are not enough. Regrettable.

El peor servicio del mundo. Antipáticos, desordenados, sin personal y ya para no lavar vasos te dan vasos de plástico para tu cerveza. La señora rubia debería tomar más  antidepresivos, los que toma no son suficientes. Lamentable.< /Review>

(Translated by Google) Although the price is high, well, meals at the airport are generally expensive. The taste wasn't too bad.

<text>We accidentally stumbled upon this park and even though I could tell it was mainly baseball fields (and we didn’t even have a ball to throw around), we decided to stop and check it out. In the center is a small fenced-in play structure that would be great for kids who need a break from watching their sibling play t-ball. My 1.5 year old son wasn’t very impressed with the playground so he spent most of the time walking up and down the bleachers.

📍 931 Bailey Ct, San Marcos, CA 92069
💰This park is free
🚙Plenty of spaces in the parking lots
🎠Fenced-in playground with mulch ground surface and shaded with canopies above. No swings.
🚽Restrooms
🧺Picnic tables under canopy shades
🪑Bleachers at all fields
🖼Small open green spaces
🚂Right next to the train tracks so you might get lucky and spot one (there is a fence barrier for saftey)

<text>The park is set up perfectly for baseball... Clean bathrooms, snack shack open during games, drinking fountains, accessible bleachers for spectators and covered/netted dugouts. The many fields are numbered in case you're new to the park. And parking is pretty good, too (of course there's never a spot when you're in a hurry). Oh, the fields are well lit for night time practices and games!< /text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

<Review>This is a great facility in San Macros, conveniently located   in the middle of the san Diego county, in which help for all the teams to come and play  tournaments.

Parking is little tight here but they do have multiple entry points to the park, so you can plan accordingly. I would suggest to look at the Google map to see the various entry points so that you can street park and get into the park conveniently.

This park have 7 baseball fields and 3 patches for throw practices.  They do how multiple restaurant areas and booth for snacks and coffee.

If you have smaller kids there is a play area right in the center of the park and it's convenient for the families to drop that kids and watch the game.

The perk for parents, there are multiple micro breweries around this park so feel free to have a beer or 2 after the game.< /Review>< Pics>

<username>Matt Walker</username><Review>Charging $5 for a little league game??  Ok. Not that big of a deal. But not accepting cards is just lame. Most people don’t carry cash anymore. If you’re going to charge for something like this then you should accept cards, Venmo, PayPal, something. Such a waste of time driving out there and having some rude high school kids tell you they only take cash.</Review><Rate>1</Rate>< user>

8-31-2020 campground is closed. Has been closed pretty much all year. The whole area is packed with people. Any little piece of dirt along the side of the road people are parking and leaving trash everywhere. Crystal Lake canp is also closed. Just a mess up there. i remember  the placee when it was nice. What a shame. The only reason for any stars is Ron the campground Host.</Text>

There's  also a small creek, lots of trees and basically free firewood. Only downside is that it's not the cleanest, especially regarding the restrooms.<//text><GmapID>0x80c31f57ce44adef:0xe418f7e1535c83d6< /GmapID>< userid>

Love this little hide away, when you can get a site. Local, quiet and very relaxing. Dog friendly, most very clean, unfortunately not all visitors are courteous enough to clean up before leaving a site. The camp host is friendly and does ckean up the vault toilets. People need to learn to leave the doors propped open when finished to air out especially durning hotter days. Anyways, try it, great little get a away!!< /Review>

Very convenient place to camp. Running water and decent shade. You often have to deal with obnoxious loud and messy urban minded people. Some of the camp sites are only big enough for 4 man tents. First come first serve. Some sites great great some horrible.<//text>

The campground appears to have been closed for some time. I’d guess since last year (2019) but I’m uncertain. I parked on the road and walked around. Seems like it could be a nice place. It needs to be cleaned up. From signs posted, it is a “burned area” and subject to falling trees, flash flooding, etc. I would not expect this campground to be open anytime soon.  You can hear a stream which would be awesome during camping, but you can also hear cars on the road.</Review>

<Review>Smaller than Crystal Lake campground but more intimate.  The spaces are clearly separated.  Toilets available.  Nice little creeks run through it.  They have benches and bbq pits at each space.  Bring the bug spray and watch out for falling branches<//Review>< pictures>

<text>Ron the host and his cat was always on top of things there.
Me and my wife stayed there last year. We enjoyed getting wet in the cool stream water.

Ron would get mad if anyone tried to dam off the water. It happen often when we visited the place.
Yogi and Boo- bo where two beers that frequent the place often . Always looking for a freebie . They would come and visit us all the time. One night I heard a noise outside the tent and I looked out. He was about 3 feet away from me. We locked eyes and he ran away. Thank god for that.

Those two trouble makers would adventure into camp often. Both bears are tagged from being caught in the city.. the one bear was shot from a tree in Azusa and made the news in Los Angeles he fell about two stories I think he was Yogi. Boo boo was caught in the same city running through backyards. They both were tagged in released up in the Angeles Crest.</text><date>1534519333113<//date>< pictures>

<review>This is a good campground. There's no potable water, so bring your own. Lots of yellow jacket activity last time I visited. Protect your food from bears. The easiest store is at the top of the road at crystal lake where they have water, food, firewood, etc.< /review><Time>1566437743716<//Time><user>115077787069091351426</user><user_name>Ben Mayne< /user_name><Response>None< /Response></record></dataset><record>

We loved this campsite! A brook runs around it and it is close to good hiking trails. Even the ride up to it was pretty. The bathrooms are simple but stay clean and there are multiple dumpsters around the place. Ron, the camp host, was very nice and helpful.</Review>

It is a small quiet place. You must arrive early to get a spot on weekends or summer months. Little water to cool off. Nice camp host.<//text>

<Rate>5</Rate><Review>This is by far my favorite campground and the only one I go to in the LA area. The camp host Ron is great, the bathrooms are simple but always stocked and clean. A stream runs through the center of the campground and can be seen and heard from all the spots. Most spots are shady all day. It's the most relaxing and deep woods atmosphere you can get within that short of a drive from LA.</Review>< Pictures>

Now the place looks better, thanks to the people who clean the hall campsite, you can walk safely  up or down the creek, and the host is friendly and very helpful . We enjoyed all time we're there.</text>< Pictures>

The views from campsite #16 were incredible, especially when you hike through the small paths. I came here on a Wednesday, and although we were as far from the others as possible, it was loud well into the night. Also there were a lot of shattered beer bottles and trash. Unfortunate that people have to ruin such a beautiful place.< /Review>

Have been here many times throughout my life. Been going there since I was a kid 30 years ago, it is still beautiful and a great place to get away from the daily grind and get out into nature. Don't tell anybody about it though, we kind of want it to be somewhat local, and not overrun by tourist.<//Review>

<Text>Campground host was nice, toilets were clean, and our campsite (#9) near the brook was great. Ended up being glad we brought all our own water as there were no spigots at our site or near us. 4 stars instead of 5 because you can clearly hear motorcycles and cars going by.<//Text>< pics>

Beautiful spacious and private campgrounds. We had a campsite next to the creek and it was beautiful to see and listen to.

Cons: The incessant number of bugs during the day- flies, gnats, wasps- you name it.
People dont pick up after themselves or dogs. We had an excess of flies due to the overwhelming number of poop puddles left throughout just our campsite alone- ppl left trash, human waste, vomit puddles.
Other than that- the campgrounds are beautiful with the natural vegitation mix of what seem to be some sort of large succulent with an abundance of beautiful trees and shrubs. The creek or stream is a good size- its not just a tiny trickle- you can hear the running stream while you sleep. At night, we camped during a no fire period so no campfires or outdoor propane gas stove fires. We sat in the darkness and took in the stars with the sound of the creek below us.
Campsite comes with a picnic table, a small fire pit ring and bbq grill. We camped with five little dogs-  crowds usually give me anxiety for fear of them barking and disturbing the peace but the space between each campsite was ample and private enough to put my mind at ease.
Highly recommend if sites are clean.</text>

<Text>This place is such a little gem in the San Gabriel Mountains! As some of the previous reviews mentioned, the brook runs through most of the camps, which is super nice.  My bf and I had a great time playing in it; the downside was that a lot of other campers kept coming over. It was also a great place to watch stars at night- so peaceful and serene.  Little critters paid us several visits at night; their rustling kept us on the edge, since we were aware of a bear attack in those mountains a few weeks back.

It's important to know that not all campsites are the same size. I think our site was one of the bigger ones; there were others where the parking spots were bigger than the site itself. Most of our neighbors seem to pack up around 10 or 11 AM, although as we can attest, coming early doesn't mean getting the best spot  [my bf and I got the last available spot]. Check out is 2pm.

Lastly, some of the reviews said there is lot of fire wood. We found a lot of tinder, but not enough big logs to sustain ourselves for the night, so we drove up to Crystal Lake [approx. 8 miles north] for some. The store aka the cafe sells them by the wheelbarrow for $20. Even though it seems a lot, it was just enough for the evening  [we slept at midnight, so the fire burned for 6hrs]. We also used it to cook, since the grill over the fire pit kinda disappeared.<//Text>< Pictures>

Is it good place to camp for being close to LA. Some nice trees at high elevation and a bear once in a while. It is close to the city so it can get loud on the weekends. There's a place to swim along the road also under a bridge not too far away. i think its 10 bucks a night.</text>

Great campground, clean bathrooms, friendly host. Campsites are clean, there are fire rings on every site, and bbqs on every site. Fills up quickly on weekends, pretty quiet week days. Fees$12 nightly. Lots of hiking trails, and a creek . There are water stickers throughout campground and it is drinkable water.< /review>

<review>I haven't actually camped but i have stayed for the day. The campground is well maintained. Has a small creek running trough. Most sites are shaded and include firepits and benches. Very nice place to stay if you live in the sgv and want to get to campground relatively fast. Weekends get packed.<//review><Time>1539803574989<//Time>< name>

<Text>I wasn't expecting the campground to be packed out midweek. Otherwise I believe this campground is just a little too spaced from any activities like hiking. The camp is beautiful no doubt, its location on the other hand leaves much to be desired for those who want to explore more than just the campground.<//Text>< pictures>

<user_name>Brenda Ho<//user_name><Response>None< /Response><pics>None< /pics><Text>We had a great time at Coldbrook Campground. It was packed during the weekend, so get there early. Everyone cleared out on Sunday afternoon (check out time is 2pm), so that was very nice! The camp host Ron was very friendly and helpful.

During our stay there was a juvenile bear who had been poking around the area for the past few weeks. Unfortunately the campers next to us were very very irresponsible and left their food out all day. The bear walked into their camp and stole some food, despite them banging pots and pans and shouting. And since they didn't clean up their food right away after that, the bear came back again a few minutes later. They were very disrespectful for not putting everything away, which puts people and especially the bear in danger. The bear struck the same camp again around dinner time, but was chased off with a bean bag gun. Please put all your food and coolers in your car trunk and don't be stupid. It was very frustrating seeing this happen and the family not really caring. They also left garbage everywhere when they left.

Campsites are great, not very secluded from each other, so it was a little annoying during the busy weekend. There are spigots everywhere for drinking water, and the creek was great to cool off in. There are vault bathrooms. Crystal Lake is a 2 mile drive up the mountain if you want to do some fishing and hiking. There is also a small restaurant and general store.< /Text><user_id>113221660343950475993</user_id>< Gmap_id>

< Review>
Great Service by manager.
But forgot to fill wiper cleaning fluid.
Could have been worse and for got the oil.
Would be a 5. But 3 is all they get. This is my store also.
First time it's happened.</Review>

Pretty fast. I went in with my daughter and we didn't have to wait long at all! The employees were friendly & I will probably go back with my other car for service.<//Review>

Came in to get a oil change and was practically ignored for 20 minutes as workers came in and out of the office. I understand they were busy, but take two minutes and talk to a customer standing by the register and ask if they need help. I just left to the next nearest oil change place and they helped me immediately even though they had more cars in the shop. They’re more expensive but I’ll take that service over what I got from Jiffy Lube any day. I never leave reviews but I expected more from Jiffy Lube< /text>

I got an engine oil change with Synthetic Oil which I feel lasts longer and performs better than petroleum oil. The service took a lot longer to get done than I like to wait and there was only one car being worked on ahead of mine. They did top off all fluids including the windshield washer fluid. However, when I went to get gas and restarted my car it sputtered and died right away. I then started it again, revved the engine a bit, and it was ok thereafter. I looked under the hood and the washer fluid cap was gone. I'm guessing they didn't tighten it up well and it flew off in between Jiffy Lube and the gas station. $6.45 on Amazon and I'm back in business with that cap. More of an annoyance and time-suck than anything. I of course took my car back to Jiffy Lube and they were very professional about reinspecting the engine. They offered to replace the cap and promised to get back to me with a small refund to cover the cost. That hasn't happened yet. We'll see if they do contact me.
All in all, the oil change was good, people there were very professional, and I will likely go back next time oil change is due.<//Text>

They greeted me as I pulled in. I asked them to check for leaks in a couple places I had suspicions about. Changed my oil, added transmission fluid and put in writing after inspecting my car. I trust them and find them to be honest. Customer Care came first. Highly recommend!!< /Review>

They did the work in a timely manner and were very helpful and friendly. I especially appreciated the manager. It’s so unusual these days to get someone actually friendly instead of brisk and efficient without a trace of humanity. I wish I could remember his name. He talked to the customers and engaged them in friendly conversation. And he gave me very helpful advice and suggestions about my car (it’s old) and how to keep it going and things to look out for. I’m not going to be in Sacramento much longer, but if I were I’d definitely return to this Jiffy Lube. Even with a mask they were all still friendly and personable.<//Review>

This is my new spot. The service was incredible from check in to check out. As soon as I pulled up, an employee walked out to my car and checked me in. He walked me to the waiting room. I could hear the great communication between the workers in the shop which made me feel more comfortable with my nice car in their hands. Of course they offered the “extras” but were not pushy at all. I will be returning.<//review>

<Text>Got the job done.  Took off 1 point because they were short staffed today so it took longer than expected.  Also, the employee that checked me in was inexperienced.  He was polite and helpful but was clearly green.  That would not have been a problem if there was someone nearby that could help out.  I did get help after one of the other guys came back into the waiting area.  I left with my oil changed, so all is good.  I will return again.  The new guy will probably be running the place by then :)<//Text><user>117243385155426912212< /user><Pictures>None<//Pictures><gmapID>0x809addfa829ed8a5:0x45e50167aeb12135</gmapID></record>

Got immediate help today diagnosing a severe oil leak.  The whole crew was professional, honest, and helpful- they told me exactly what and where the leak problem was and what to do (not drive!!).  My dog was with me and she enjoyed all the pets the friendly staff gave her while waiting for the tow truck.  Will 100% recommend and return for future oil changes.  This is exactly the type of business our neighborhood should support- all the young men had pride in their work and it was obvious they had great leadership.</review>

Been coming to this Jiffy Lube for awhile now,  was just here Friday,  pulled in at 5:30 hoping they would take me, as they close at 6pm. They were kind and accepted me, I was in and out within 15 minutes.  I always use the $10 off coupon for my oil change,  easy to find on google! Their excellent customer service is why I always come to this one!</Text>

They were busy but the manager made it fun. He was cracking jokes and made everyone feel welcome. I got in my car and forgot to turn the key to turn it on. Immediately panicked 😂. One of the workers popped into the driver's seat and turned the key. I was embarrassed but they totally made it a laughable situation 😂</review>

<Review>After being charged over $100 at another oil change station, I was thrilled to get to Jiffy Lube on Sunrise and getting in and out in only 15 minutes and the total charge was $56!  They did not try to upsell me and they were very kind and courteous.  I will definitely go back!<//Review>< Response>

<review>They get props for friendliness and speed, but they left so much dirt on my front passenger seat as well as dirty handprints ALL OVER my glove box. They also didn't reset my auto oil gage. BUT the owner reached out to me and offered a full refund and free car wash, even if I didn't plan on returning to his business. Who does that?!  Matt seriously went above and beyond, and I am BLOWN AWAY by the stunning customer service he provided me.<//review>< pics>

I went here because it had the best reviews of the ones I was looking at. The guys here were completely professional and were able to get my vehicle in for an oil change right away. Within 20 minutes my oil was changed and other fluids topped off.  I would definitely recommend going her for your future oil changes!</Text>

I came in asking for two things, an oil change and new wipers. They did their "inspection" and said I also needed my brake fluid changed. I explained that my brakes were already scheduled to be looked at by the dealer. Their response was that brake fluid wasn't normally inspected during pad replacements. I declined their offer and stuck to my original request (except they were also able to hawk a battery replacement as well).

A few weeks later I had my brakes done by the dealer. I made sure to have them check the fluid. As you can probably expect, the fluids were fine. In fact, as far as I know, it's never been topped up since.

These guys, at the time, were clearly hucksters. Until they come clean, I would avoid the place.</Text>< Pics>

<time>1623954416836<//time><Rate>1<//Rate><Text>This is the worst place ever, my grandma got transferred here after her time in the ER was over. She had made lots of progress and was showing incredible signs. She was doing very good but was very neglected by staff and faculty. Another thing is that they never made sure she had her oxygen on, which she needed. if your loved one is going here for the intense care unit PLEASE DO NOT SEND THEM HERE! This is the worst place ever and they did not continue checking up on my grandma, knowing she would take her oxygen off. This staff does not care for your loved ones health, they show no remorse or kindness to patients what so ever. My grandmother recently passed away because of the neglect she was facing at this rehab. So please if you care for your loved ones; DONT SEND THEM HERE.</Text>< Pics>

< Review>
My father is in for the last two weeks and is doing great after surgery. The only issue is his walking. Before the surgery he was able to walk around his home, slowly. It was enough to take care of himself. He’s in rehab just to get him walking again, since he hasn’t walked for several weeks. He claims that nobody has been to his room for getting him up and walking around the couple weeks he been in. With no visitors without an appointment it’s hard to verify this, but my father’s memory is very good yet, and when I ask the staff they say they are, my father says differently. Someone is lying.<//Review>

< review>
This place just took my grandfather last week and he went in he was just a little weak but the doctors didn't find any major issues other than him not doing enough excerise and eating properly. Within a matter of a couple days he had a terrible staff infection and he was throwing up blood. This place nearly killed my grandfather and to make matters worse they will not let you in half the time, they LOST his personal belongings, and even the doctor at the hospital said that they see this exact issue from this rehab facility all the time!!! They go in fine and they come out near dying!!! This place must be shut down before their negligence gets more people killed!! Makes me sick!</review>

<Review>This place was a such a bad experience. We had my father here to recover but all they did was neglect him. He got horrible bed soars from how little they acctualy moved him positions and from how little they cleaned him. The doctor never updated you with peogress or with lab test results. The physical theipy personel would do the minimum and just be talking the whole time amongs themselfs. We had them send my father to the hospital becuse they neglected to do anything about a mass growing in his stomach. Neddless to say it was a serious situation and if we didnt get him to the icu quickly things could have taken a turn for the worse. Seams like all they did here was add more pain.<//Review>< Pictures>

<Review>My mother in law was sent here because she tested positive for COVID. Thankfully she survived with only a moderate case. Overall this place is like all the others she has been in. I would normally give 3 stars if it were not for her case manager Kim. She was so kind and was the best we have experienced anywhere. Reche Canyon, if you are reading this, she is making you look much better in my eyes and earned you a solid one star increase!!!</Review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

<Text>My father was transferred to this facility by Corona regional hospital that did absolutely nothing for him. But this facility took wonderful care and they did allow us to come in at the end of his life so we could contact family that was not able to be here so everyone could say their goodbyes. They were very wonderful and caring.<//Text><user_id>102583292999496367588</user_id>< Resp>

<review>My cousin suffered brain damage 7+years ago and is totally bedridden. He has been To multiple locations where he has received less than average care and it was so terrifying to see the horrible things that go on at some of these care facilities. We had to move him around until we found a place that we saw was consistently and properly taking care of him and his needs, as well as ours when we inquired about his recovery. Hes now been at Reche Canyon Rehab for almost 5 years and they have done wonders with him. They go above and beyond to make sure he gets the best care possible. We’ve never noticed any signs of neglect or mistreatment from any of his caretakers or staff members at this facility unlike the previous two locations he was at prior to arriving there. Family is super important and it’s so hard to find nice safe clean place with great people to care for them when they’re in need of help. I saw all these horrible reviews so I had to speak up and share with others about how awesome this place truley is because it is so hard and really scary trying to find a good place for our loved ones. So I was really upset to read bad things about such a good place. I called today just to check in on the visitation schedule and LJ picked RIGHT AWAY and was super professional and helpful, like always. He had to place me on hold to get my question answered but came back within 60 seconds with all the information info i needed and more. Plus he always has a great attitude and was very knowledgeable. Dont let this crazy pandemic situation mess up a good place’s reputation, were all dealing with crazy times right now with the limited resources so we have to be considerate for the people who are taking care of the people who cant care for themselves. I’ve had to take care of my own Mom and it was so hard to find time and deal with her needs and crazy stubbornness and house, feed and bath her, so I understand the struggle is real.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

<Review>I did leave a nasty detailed review about how infested this location is but it did not post. Do not take loved ones there. staff is infected and told to stay at work by administration. this is detrimental to our society health. Very poor due diligence. 65+ cases and no precocious taken. so if you care do not go to this facility< /Review>< user>

<time>1576082763208< /time><Rating>4< /Rating><review>I was a patient at this facility a few years back and after reading all the awful ratings I had to put my two cents in. My stay in this facility save my life I was in a motorcycle accident where I fractured my back the therapist that work with me his name is Joe me he got me through my first month at what turned out to be Exchange in life I was in a wheelchair for 7 months learning how to walk again it was a staff at this facility they gave me all the tools I needed to move on with my life. I think all the awful reviews come from people expecting miracles or more that can really be expected. In order to recover from an injury you have to want to be rehabilitated if you treat your therapist and staff poorly you will obviously get a poor response.</review><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmapID>

<Review>If you care about your loved ones, do not let them go here. I would give a zero star if I could. They’re negligence led to my grandfathers passing. They do not care. They left him alone for hours on end, he ended up getting bed sores. They gave him narcotics when he wasn’t prescribed anything but Motrin. He lost a ton of weight because they weren’t feeding him. Seems like they just want their patients drugged so they don’t have to do their Job.< /Review>< pics>

My brother is there and has ALS, he has severely progressed since February when he got there. I can't believe they lost a computer of his that he uses daily to communicate with his wife and daughter. He has had numerous roommates pass away in the last 3 months due to negligence of not responding to alarms coming from the rooms. There all too busy having luncheons and fundraisers for there own special events. I can't wait till my bro gets out of there and his wife can bring him home. For this place has doubled the stress on her and his condition.<//Text>

My sister was sent to Reche canyon rehab after sustaining a back injury. The nurses aide put a diaper on her. She is not incontinent! She was able to use the bedpan. They were so long answering the call light that she had to use the diaper a few times and ended up with a bladder infection which they did not treat. She was discharged after 10 days. It was very rushed and the nurse and physical therapist seemed surprised and unprepared. She was sent home without discharge instructions. The doctor ordered home health, PT and OT. The case manager did nothing! She should have gotten authorization from her insurance and sent orders to a home health agency. She did Nothing.
Her primary doc took care of the infection and home health. She has been home 2 weeks in a back brace without home health or PT. They are starting tomorrow.

Reche canyon rehab is incompetent, smelly, uncaring. Don’t go there!</Review>

Why has this facility remain opened??
I feel that this place should be investigated thoroughly by state officials. Doctors and Social Services do not respond to messages left.  Patient with anxiety & pain left for another patient only to die from heart attack that could possibly be prevented!  DO NOT SEEK CARE HERE!!<//review>

<text>This place is so poorly ran it’s unfair to the patients first off. Secondly then employees have no way to even take care of a patient.
Every RN has 20 patients a person. There is no way any patients needing real care or assistance to be cared for there is just no time for anykind of attention. If you loved is basically 100% healthy and can communicate clearly and use the restroom alone you can send them here... but if they need help or assistance PLEDE SAVE THEIR LIVES and fight for them to go to Somewhere else..this place does give enough staff to properly run.. I will give another review with details later... please fight you loved ones</text><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None< /response><gmapID>0x80dcac6f5ebb8813:0x6e313692d6103084< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Kaiser Permanente recommended that our mother live her last days in this facility because the doctors didn’t think she would survive living in the higher elevation where we live on hospice. Kaiser provided the “comfort care” room. This room is designed to be family friendly, allowing 24/7 access and a place for a member of the family to sleep with her overnight. The doctors are caring and compassionate. Everyone was helpful and respectful. The setting is amazing, away from the hustle and bustle of the city yet freeway close for all the family to visit.< /Review>

<text>My husband was recently a patient at Reche Canyon for  a little less than a month. I was able to visit him every day and witnessed the progress he made on a daily basis thanks to his effort and to the staff that helped him day after day.  He received exceptional service and care by the nursing and physical therapy personnel.  I can't thank them enough for their dedication to help us, their kindness and professionalism.  The office and food services departments were always very attentive and helpful as well.  Thank you, everyone, for helping us in our time of great need.  God bless you all.

This place is the worst I have ever seen not only did my father pass away in this place many years ago but now I personally know why, I was put in here for after surgery rehab and I thank God I was taken out by family members after 1 day of being there. I hope I never have to go there again. Way too many reasons I hate it there. I wish I didnt have to give it any stars at all.</Review>

My mom was there & she hated it. She was left exposed, left in the bathroom for 45 mins with the door closed. Thank God I spoke to the doctor who released her to my care. Although Administration was very helpful who tried to resolve any problems. It’s the nurses, they are overwhelmed, too many patients & not enough staff. This is what one nurse relayed to me. Watch your Love one closely there cause patients are usually unattended.< /text>

My wife was sent here about a montn ago for physical theraphy on her leg. From the second she got there @ 9 o'clock  she wasn't acknowledged  at all. It took the staff almost 3hr for them to realize she was a new patient if it wasn't for myself asking them for her meds and any documents they needed me to sign for her , they would have taken longer for her to get acknowledged , they also give u dirty looks  when u ask for there services. Also her pain meds where not even in there system  they had to re-order them. So she was in agonizing pain for about 16 hrs. Staff was suppose to help her in and out of bed do to the fact she was a fall risk, they did care at all she was made to get up on her own to the restroom. And back and also adjust her self on the bed when she wasn't able too cause she had cervical surgery. That got me so angry  I got my wife out there in 1 day. This place should  b shut down  do to the fac5 that they r very careless.....< /review>

My father was sent to this "rehabilitation" center after a broken back and head trauma in late April. The staff is barely attentive and give dirty looks when you ask for assistance making it almost a necessity to be there from open to close. My father developed blood clots which moved to his lungs after Kaiser had to re-stitch the incision because of an infection he developed because Reche left his back brace on 24/7 rarely turning him. After he was cleared they sent him back to reche where he spent 3 weeks of people leaving him alone in the dark, refusing medicine, ignoring his yells and screams for help and the physical therapy was a joke. This is a nursing home where very ill people go, not a facility to help get people up and going.This is the worst place I've ever been to. My father and our family were traumatized by this facility.</review>

My father was a patient there.
Was supposed to receive physical therapy for his legs.
Instead was striped down, put in a paper diaper and told to stay in bed.
Horrible services. Patients are parked in a common room while the people that are supposed to take care of them, sit around and read newspapers and watch tv.
Don't let your loved ones go there.</Text>

<Review>this place is a piece of GARBAGE. they dropped my mother 3 times  & didn’t even want to give her an X RAY until i called & made them. TRANSFERRED HER TO ANOTHER FACILITY, & “NETWORK MARKETING FROM RECHE CANYON” CAME TO THE NEW FACILITY TO “CHECK ON HER”. FOR WHAT ?? YOU ALREADY DROPPED HER AND WANTED TO GIVE HER “TYLENOL”  FOR THE PAIN. THEY’VE BEEN GIVING ME THE RUN AROUND FOR YEARS. YOU ALL WILL GET WHATS COMING TO YOU. FROM THE HEAD NURSES RIGHT ON DOWN TO THE SOCIAL WORKER ELIZABETH WHO IS NEVER THERE !! YOU ALL WILL PAY.<//Review><rate>1</rate>< user_id>

This place is filthy.  I can't believe kiaser would send anyone here.  My father will probably die in this place.  He's only been here less than 24 hrs and for some reason his health has taken a nose dive...</review>

<review>Place is horrible. I wouldn't send my worst enemy there. My very dear friend acquired a staph infection there, they refused to give her pain medication & she ultimately died there. As she was taking her last breaths her doctors denied that she was dying & refused to give her medication to assist with her shortness of breath. This is coming from a hospice nurse.<//review>< pics>

<text>I was sent to Reche Canyon from Kaiser, Fontana  after 15 days in the Hospital, flat on my back. I am 85 years old and midway through my stay at Kaiser I had surgery to repair a torn diaphragm and liver from a broken rib. When they discharged me to Reche Canyon I had not been out of bed for 15 days. I arrived at Reche Canyon on Easter Sunday, April 16th with Oxygen @ 2% and couldn't even sit up by myself. The staff was wonderful, attentive, the food wan't too bad and best of all - NO SMELL. They worked with me every day and I was discharged on April 29th without any oxygen and able to get up out of bed and walking around the facility on my own, with a walker of course. I am very happy with the care I was given  here and would recommend this facility to anyone who must go to a skilled nursing facility.<//text><Time>1494349233730< /Time><username>Kathryn Chidester</username><Resp>None</Resp>< pictures>

I hate to even give this place one star but I have to because it won't let me choose zero stars. BEWARE!  Worst place ever!!  My 22 year old son was sent here from Kaiser with a brain injury.  We only had four options of sub acute care facilities to choose from and Reche Canyon was the best of the worst. The first time he was sent there he was only there for four days when he had to be rushed back to the hospital with pneumonia as well as an unstageable bed wound (did not have this when he was discharged from Kaiser 4 days prior).  The bed wound was later staged at a stage 4. He was sent back to Reche Canyon two weeks later where his bed wound continued to get worse (down to his bone). Within a two month timeframe he was in the emergency room at Loma Linda 3 different times. The last straw for me was when they ended up having to bag him (CPR) because his oxygen saturation dropped below 50%, he was sent to the emergency room at Loma Linda where he then was transferred to Kaiser with pneumonia for the third time, a completely out of control bed wound,  and a staph infection. After that I did everything I could not to let them send him back to Reche Canyon. Reche Canyon almost killed my son due to the lack of care. I was there every single day with my son but they do not allow anybody to stay past 9 PM. So between 9:00 PM and the next day only God knows what they did with my son or didn't do with my son.  Plenty of times staff there would tell me that they are understaffed and this is why some patients don't get tended to properly, especially the patients that don't have family members to speak up for them. If your family member cannot speak for themselves DO NOT send them here. I have educated myself on patients rights and learned how to be an excellent advocate for my son.< /Text>

My father, Wilburn Milligan is in room 112 and had to wait an hour for someone to give him pain medicine last night for his broken hip, he is almost 90 years old.
today he came back from dialysis and needed covers on and again his call button doesn't seem to work to get help! The lady with his dinner tray had to help him! I hope he has his pain medicine when he needs it tonight, or I will be filing a complaint! I called the hospital and got disconnected!< /Review>

Went to donate about 15 bags of new/near-new toys and clothing.  3 pm.  Closed early and "unable to accept donations"?

The doors are wide open.  Seems to me, staff is being lazy.  Regardless, sad to turn down donations.  At a minimum, management has failed to allow a donation center to accept donations.</Review>

<text>Poor experience.   Daughter saw cute shoes she wanted. But couldn't make purchase with temp. Bank card!!! $29.90 purchase. Visiting Ontario . they showed no customer appreciation. I felt embarrassed and left empty handed. Took my business to different goodwill spent $290 dollars and made a donation. The workers were helpful and polite.   I will not shop other store again.!!!!!</text>< gmapID>

The manager Angelica gives her friends priority in buying jewelry. I have observed her bringing containers of jewelry out when here friends are in the store,  and she whistles to alert them that she bring out the jewelry. Not fair to the loyal goodwill customers. This happened on October 8th at about 4:30 if management wants to check the cameras</text>

One of the better goodwill stores in the area. It had a good mix of clothes, furniture, and random items you didn't know you need. Low prices and friendly people.</Text>

< review>
UPDATE: Funny how a store can leave such a bad taste in a customers mouth after being a favorite. This went from one of my favorite locations, to now one of my least favorite. My lady and I wanted to buy a little shelf that was out on the floor with nothing on it. It was perfect dimensions for what I needed it for, and in this situation it was urgent. I asked if we can get a price check on it, and they told me it was a "display" shelf and that it's not for sale. Are you kidding me? There were so many other shelves that they could use for "display". All the other shelves didn't have enough depth for what I needed it for, but this one did. Right next to this shelf is also a huge wire shelf that was half empty and being used for display. As a recurring customer, I felt appalled by this. This seemingly stupid shelf that served little to no purpose to them wouldn't be sold when I would have gladly bought for more than its obviously worth because of my urgent situation. Lame, and left a bad taste in my mouth.

TLDR; They wouldn't sell me a small wooden shelf that had nothing on it because it was a "display". My situation was urgent, the shelf was perfect for me, and they had tons of other shelves to use for "display".

ORIGINAL: One if my favorite goodwills to shop at. Nice location with a variety of goods. Naturally, most of the stuff will be considered junk goods here. However, a few times I have found unique goods for very cheap. I'd say check it out if you have the chance and you're in the area.<//review>

<review>I will surely recommend this cinema house for everyone because of its amazing and well-maintained facilities. This place is really one of the best in the area, and I'm happy because they have the best snacks to complement the movies. Indeed, a great place to relax and enjoy a movie! Strongly recommended!<//review>< Name>

For those who looked for a movie house and the place to hang out with, this movie house was the best for you! The staff here were accommodating, informative, and decent. Besides, the foods that they served were hot, and the drinks taste good. The arrangement of the movie house was organized and comfortable. Also, the screen was big and clear. It was truly the best to visit here!<//review>

<Text>I had the best night together with my boyfriend here in this movie house. The seats are comfortable and we had a delicious dinner all while watching a movie. Our experience there from walking into the watching movie was great. They were also great because the movie house is kept clean, organized and the staff is friendly. Highly recommended!< /Text>< username>

Theater is about as clean we can expect a theater to be. Reclining, comfy leather seats. Definitely nice if you're in the area.</Review>

<text>Historic and iconic movie theater in the heart of Castro. Totally recommend their sing-a-long performances which day run regularly with different movied. I recommend checking their website in advance to see when is the best showing for you. We watched Queen on a Sunday and the theater was packed but comfortable.
Paying extra for the sing-a-long was absolutely worth it!  You get a goodie bag with fun props the audience can use while watching the movie. there is a costume contest and everybody is just joining in the fun!! I loved it</text>< pictures>

We came here for a North Face speaker series and watched short film clips. The theatre has very nice decor and seats were fairly comfortable. There are a lot of good food options close by as well. The coolest feature is at the beginning of the show a musician rises out of the floor and plays a Wurlitzer...that is real and pretty epic.</review>

The beautiful old theater, right in the heart of Castro. Great place to see older films. The prices for popcorn and drinks are surprisingly reasonable. The ladies behind the counter seemed to have an attitude as if they were doing me a favor by selling me popcorn and coke, but it was late and maybe they were tired.</text>

Beautifully restored, old time movie house. Healthy snack bar with great popcorn.
Came from Sacramento to see a movie not playing in my area and this historic theater made it worth it.</review>

You can see the old Hollywood glamour shining through in the decor. They still have an organist playing before the movie began. I was there for a SFFilm premiere of the movie Q Ball. Lots of fun! They have a bar and snacks.< /Review>

Worst seat I have ever felt in my entire life. I couldn't lean back for the entire show. I don't think I would ever go back without a pillow or something. The seats were so bad that I would give this one star even with the cool architecture and the awesome show.<//Review>

I've been to many different types of show at the Castro Theater, and it's always a great time. The concession stand is somewhat basic compared to other theaters, but there are plenty of good bars and restaurants nearby.

Come a bit early, and there's often a mini-concert on the organ. (The closing number on the night I took the pic was the Liberty Bell March - very appropriate for a Monty Python double feature.) Sing-alongs and Peaches Christ shows are also lots of fun.< /text>

This place is a treasure. This kind of an amazing Art Deco palace in the heart of vivid Castro. Great spot. If not for the movie -then go there at least for the interior and allow yourself to be carried by the atmosphere.</text>

Fun theater & fun show! Check if your tickets have assigned seating before the night of the event - if they don’t (like mine didn’t), make sure to get there early, like 7pm-for-an-8pm-show early, if you want to sit together with friends in the orchestra area</text>

<Review>Fun comfy old theater. Definitely not state of the art sound or projection, but come here for a cultural experience, and vintage style.  If you are lucky the classic pipe organ will be playing and other live elements that make this place one of a kind.< /Review><time>1582182673832</time></record>

Just saw the premier of The Irishman here. As a lifelong movie fan, this is among my favorite movie theaters I've ever been to. It has that awesome retro feel that you get at small town movie theaters, but the difference is that this one is located right in The Castro, one of the most fun and vibrant neighborhoods of the city, and that its capacity is absolutely massive - it can seat a whopping 1,400 people! There is excellent sound quality, the screen is very big, and the seats are reasonably comfortable. The interior design is beautiful.

Tips: come here early, especially if you're coming to a movie's opening night, as there are no assigned seats and the line for concession and even the bathrooms can get ridiculously long before a sold-out screening. You can (and should) buy tickets online to make sure you get in. And finally, unlike most AMC theaters, the movies here start almost exactly on time - maybe 5-10 minutes after the scheduled start time. So aim to be here 15-30 minutes early if you want to get snacks / use the bathroom / secure the best seats in the house.< /Text>

Beautiful historic theater showing everything from Vertigo to Alien to The Little Mermaid Sing-Along to film festival fare, complete with organ music before the show. The theater is obviously older, but is always clean and well-maintained and has a lot of vibrant decor to show for its age.<//text>

This is one of the great theaters in the world.

A comfortable, and amazing experience always. Every show is not merely "seeing a movie" -- it's an event. Most films are double features and there's always something special about the show. Go on their website, and go see something that looks interesting to you. Tons of great movies, and it changes every weekend. Incredible theater!< /text>

<review>The beautiful old theater, right in the heart of Castro. Great place to see older films. The prices for popcorn and drinks are surprisingly reasonable. The ladies behind the counter seemed to have an attitude as if they were doing me a favor by selling me popcorn and coke, but it was late and maybe they were tired.</review>< response>

Saw Guster there. Fun space for a show, though the line to get in was oppressive and weather freezing.

Worth it though for the great ambiance inside. Very cool lighting that transformed theater into a great concert venue. Sat toward back, could see everything.</text>

Timeless and genuine. Ornate and friendly. The Castro projects a living energy from it's very walls and transcends that feeling when the organ player rises up through the stage. A wonderful place to join the community in theater and joy, drama and mystery.</review>

<review>Was not actually @ The Castro Theater, although we were in San Francisco's Castro District.  Whole Foods Market is on the corner of Market Street & Dolores.

<Review>After hearing so much about this place over the years I've lived in the Bay, maybe I was overly excited.
Aside from the very conspicuous lack of AC, this was the WORST sound system I've ever heard. Literally my high school's auditorium had better sound.
We came to see Lovett or Leave it and had pretty nosebleed seats. I normally wouldn't have cared so much but it was unbearably hot and the sound system wasn't even loud enough to hear the show... We stayed half an hour and left disappointed but thankful for the fresh air outside.< /Review>< Time>

I've been patronizing The Castro Theatre since the 80s. Great films of all genres and the variety of yearly film festivals make The Castro a standout.  Opened in 1922 make sure you try the popcorn.</text>

The jewel of the Castro- a must do for any tourist or local. Screens new films, old classics that change almost every other night (tonight its blade rummer/tron double feature). Bonus: occasionally they bust out the live organist.</text>

The Castro is a beautiful and historic theater on Castro Street, near Market, in the heart of the Castro, the famous gay neighborhood. The 1400-seat theater has a live organist, a beautiful interior, and is chock full of history. It's great to see old kitschy movies there or go for a film festival or special screening. The Castro Theatre is a treasure!

[Update March 2019]
I love the Castro Theatre and have been here many times over the years.

Last night, I went with friends to the Bohemian Rhapsody Sing-a-Long, which was one of the most fun nights I've had in years. Of course I had already seen the movie, which you should anyway but it makes this kind of event even better, and then seeing it this way was a special treat.

With a $16 admission, you get a goodie bag filled with a paper gold crown, which most people wore, a glow stick, a popper thing, and a little bottle for blowing bubbles. The theatre was completely packed with a diverse crowd ready for fun.

The Castro Theatre is beautiful, they have a live organist, arranged a little costume show off, and seem to care about their patrons enjoying themselves.

We sang, we sighed, we whooped, we applauded and we hissed, we laughed and we cried, and we were all in it together. Like Queen says about Queen, we were a family, at least for a couple hours. And it was magical.

I shall return.</Text>

We did the Bohemian Rhapsody sing-along here. Everybody was given a bag of party goodies, including glow lights. We sat in the balcony of the jam packed theater. The preshow, with Freddie Mercury impersonator contest & performance, put everyone in a festive mood.

But, the experience I'll relish forever was during the sing-along the entire audience would wave their glow lights, creating a rich tapestry of color & light. It's rare that you have a performance that engages an audience's senses the way this movie has. When it was over everyone felt exhilarated, as if they had witness something truly special.

I love this theater, I love this movie, and I loved the audience.< /text>

I've never reviewed this Theater due to the fact that I had never seen a movie there. My first visit was this past weekend.  Otherwise, I think it's a  large vintage theater known for showing classic movies.</Text>

<text>Iconic. Some call it the "Heart of the Castro," and it has been central to San Francisco GLBTQ culture since its restoration. You have to see something there to fully appreciate  the venue, and if you are lucky, you will be treated to delightful live music played on the magnificent theater organ before your film or event.<//text><pics>None</pics>< response>

A historic place that you must visit. Hearing the historic organ before an evening show is wonderful. They are a main venue for many LGBT events, especially the longest running LGBT film festival in the world, Frameline.</text>

<Review>Horrible over the phone costumer service. Called the box office to ask about confirming the start time of a film and was told very coldly to check the website because that’s where the film times are listed. Makes me not want to give this organization my money when customers are treated like a burden for asking clarifying questions.< /Review><pics>None</pics><Response>None</Response><gmapID>0x808f7e1b4ff86179:0x14fad42ba6399425</gmapID></record>

<Review>Iconic and I love the organ recitals before each show. My favorite film Lawrence of Arabia was playing here recently, and it was a delight to hear the sound, and digitally remastered visual blasting away my senses in the grand auditorium. They have no military or veteran discounts but one time the ticket booth clerk was kind enough to give me one. Their double features are very well organized, artistic statements of provocative and intelligent film experts.</Review><rating>5<//rating>< resp>

Built in the 1920's this theater is gorgeous inside and out!  Spectacular movies and concerts galore.  As a native San Franciscan, I'm so grateful and proud to have this gem in the neighborhood.  You must experience it to appreciate it's history and beauty.  ❤❤❤< /Text>

Watched 2001: A Space Odyssey here this evening and can confidently say that this is my favorite cinema anywhere. It was built in the 1920s and is incredibly beautiful inside. The prices are very reasonable, the seats comfortable and the hardware very good though not what you would expect from a newer cinema. If you want a truly 'authentic' experience watching some of the best movies humanity has even made, though, this is the place!<//Review>

<Text>I attended an event here, the place was great, even if I think the seating was a bit cramped like a traditional theater is. Nice big viewing screen and beautiful ceiling architecture. There's a great set of local shops just on the street, and most everyone in SF is very friendly. Would recommend going again.</Text>< Date>

One of the best 'old time theaters' in San Francisco. They do everything from movies & sing-a-longs to live stage performances. This theater even has an organ that rises from the orchestra pit and gets played prior to movies and other performances. I just volunteered for the. San Francisco Gay Men's Chorus at the Castro Theater where they  performed their yearly "Home for the Holidays", and we got to watch the last performance of the night. Its a very special place!<//review>

My hands-down favorite place in San Francisco. It's always a treat to go there for a show or movie, and they present lots of double features and classics. The Castro Theater is a treasure!< /Text>

The Castro Theatre is a popular San Francisco movie palace which became San Francisco Historic Landmark #100 in September 1976.[2] Located at 429 Castro Street, in the Castro district, it was built in 1922 with a California Churrigueresque façade that pays homage—in its great arched central window surmounted by a scrolling pediment framing a niche—to the recently rebuilt basilica of Mission Dolores nearby. Its designer, Timothy L. Pflueger, also designed Oakland's Paramount Theater and other movie theaters in California in that period. The theater has over 1,400 seats (approx 800 downstairs and 600 in the balcony).[3][4] The theater's ceiling is the last known leatherette ceiling in the United States and possibly the world.[citation needed] Another leatherette ceiling was demolished just a few years ago.[where?] To make the ceiling look as though it is leather requires a special technique regarded as lost today.[by whom?]< /text>

< Review>
Best film house in the city, what a old time movie palace should look and feel like instead of the sterile cold boxes there building now. 1st matinee of the day is best ,people listen no talking phones are on mute and no bright cell phone screens too be seen and you can't beat the price and the smell of fresh popcorn sets you in the mood too enjoy...</Review>

<review>Nice to see historical theatre still around.
Organ playing before show is great.
Seats are uncomfortable.
1 movie is ok. Don't do double feature or u get home with a backache.
Awesome monthly show calendar very well made.</review>< Rating>

Whether a campy live drag show from Peaches Christ, a camp classic like Mommie Dearest, or the Film Noir Festival, or a Sing-Along you will have the time of your life in this 1929 movie palace. David Hegarty gets things rolling nightly with live organ music - don't forget to clap along when he closes his set with San Francisco. Friendly staff, great popcorn, and a truly great repertory of classic,  modern,  and just released films.  It's my neighborhood movie house and I love it!</text>

<Text>The Castro Theatre is probably the most historic theatre in the Bay Area. Whether you're here for a film festival, an old movie screening, a sing-a-long, a comedy performance or a drag show, you're bound to have a blast! The interior design is magnificent. It's really stunning inside. Plus, every show starts off with a delightful organ player! How rad! One of my favorite experiences here was seeing a screening of Hitchcock's "Vertigo" here, which takes place in San Francisco. Seriously, super cool. It's literally in the center of the city and the most photographed icon in the Castro.< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None<//response><gmap_id>0x808f7e1b4ff86179:0x14fad42ba6399425< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
A holiday tradition now for my CA family. What can be more fun and camp but to dress up as characters, get a goodie bag of props, and have fun along with kids of all ages? Young and people with some mileage. This year we participated in the Sing Along Sound of Music. Last year it was Beauty and the Beast. There are lots of different movies at the Castro Theater in the midst of a colorful area of SF.  And they publish a monthly schedule. This Art Deco Palace Theater is fully restored, along with the theater organ which is played before the movie. Look hard and you will see a lotus, Buddhas, and other exotic things to transport you to another time and place. Truly a taste of the magic of Hollywood.</Review>

I have been going hear for years 40+ , it great to see it has survived the development that is running our city. It's all ways fun to explore the Castro bars after a cool old flick.

This was our first year - of many, we hope - attending NOIR CITY in San Francisco at the gorgeous Castro Theatre.  We loved every aspect - the organ playing during intermission was especially great.  There aren't a lot of true movie palaces left that are in the excellent condition of the Castro.  If you are a golden age movie buff, this is definitely worth a stop!<//text>

<review>I love the Castro and hope it lasts forever. The preshow organ is so classic and the space is enchanting. I see any movie I can there, especially during film fests and other special screenings. My wish list includes less lines (bathroom, concessions) and more pronounced flooring grades to ensure that the entire screen is visible from every seat. Although I'm tall, I often have to lean to either side so I can see beyond the person in front of me.</review></record>

It's so gay. I guess it's okay since it's in the Castro. Aren't there any New Artsy gay things they could play at this theater rather then reruns of the Golden girls and silly looking old men running around with death rock make-up on poking fun at the way other people dress and look?</review>

<review>The six vertical letters attached to the facade of the theater are probably the brightest part of the building. I have to say I am a bit disappointed by its dark interior that really can use some good lighting. The seats are comfortable but the decorations look very dull. I can tell there used to be glory but they faded away and desperately needs some restoration.

Even so, I appreciate what the theater does for the community. We went for a Saturday three features marathon starting from 5 pm until almost midnight. You can have your hand stamped and go out eat and come back later during the shows. The projection on the screen is not super sized but it's crispy clear. The echo of audio is little bit distracting, but I bet that adds flavor to live performance and concerts. Even this place is not brand new, but facility is maintained and functioning well.

The best of if is that it does not show 40-minutes long commercials in other for profit cinemas. You go in, enjoy the live organ performance to soothe your mind, then lights dim and movie starts.

I bet there are lot of memories and stories heard and seen by the high ceiling. I hope people will continue to support the iconic monument that is part of the history.</review>< username>

They're always playing some awesome off-beat old movie or something recent that was really good if you missed it the first time around in theaters. One of my favorite nights out in recent memory was a trip here for an R. Kelly "Trapped in the Closet" sing-along! Any venue that hosts an event like that is top-notch in my book!< /text>< pics>

How can you not love the Castro Theater! It’s so beautiful and quirky! The organ introductions are fantastic, and the building is just stunning.

What’s more every time you come here you’re helping to support a San Francisco landmark! So get And ticket, buy some popcorn and settle down to view some history.<//Review>

<Text>I've lived in San Francisco for over forty years and I've always loved the Castro Theater. They carefully chose their films, and sometimes, there is an organ player before the show, always ending with a rousing version of "San Francisco Open Your Golden Gate..."

Castro Theater is amazing! I have been there for a sing-a-long of Grease, film festival with students from my school, and a general movie. The building is pretty and if you arrive early to the movie you may get the opportunity to watch a wonderful organ player perform. It is right next to Hot Cookie, if you want a snack before or after your show.<//Text>

Classic big ornate movie palace. There are not that many left in the world. There is only 1 screen! Sometimes they have a live organist play before the show in the evenings. Bring your kiddies to the sing-a-long Frozen or Sound of Music, etc. Highly recommended.</Text>

<text>Wonderful Historic Theatre!
Totally worth visiting for any of the wide variety of Films played there, mostly as brief repetory showings.  Or to attend the special frequent live events.  Very large seating capacity, also with upper balcony that is opened for more popular events.  Despite the dowager theatre's age, it has high-quality projection and upgraded sound system.  And attending any screening or event there is also like taking a trip back in time to the heydays of early films.  Also it's important to support historic venues like this, so they will last for decades to come!<//text><date>1513197014206< /date>< resp>

I'm not usually much for a sing along show. But this place did a great job of making it kitschy but not overbearing.  Lots of queens there in Castro and some even dress the parts. But I didn't hate it.  Was really kinda cute.  But I didn't sing along.  Just those other guys I was with did.  A barrel of laughs.   I recommend it highly....</text>

Great place to catch a show. Saw a live read of some absurdist script here for Sketch Fest, bottom floor had a vendor selling organic popcorn which I found questionable. Is not all popcorn organic? In any case, very cool decor inside, good seating options. Opt for balcony front row if you can, see all the things.<//text>

<pictures>None< /pictures><Text>I've been wanting to go see a movie at The Castro Theatre for a very long time.  I finally got to go when they were showing Vertigo.

It's a beautiful venue, and I thought it was so cool that there was an organ player before the movie.

And for such a historic theatre, and for being in a popular neighborhood, the ticket prices are reasonable.  I didn't buy anything at the concession stand, but my roommates did and they said it was expensive.  Better to eat beforehand.

Be sure to check out their website to for a calendar of all the movies they're showing, which includes sing-a-longs!<//Text>< gmapID>

Watched Lawrence of Arabia here in 70mm film to remind myself how a proper film presentation can be. Left very disappointed. Audio quality was terrible: lots of echo in the room; music was shrill and harsh. Picture quality was poor: extreme hot spotting; visible seams and distortions in the screen material; extreme flicker; and a worn-out projector that resulted in repeated incidents of violent vertical shaking of the picture for several seconds at a time. The film even stopped at one reel change and the audience sat there in the dark for several minutes while they fixed it.

At the intermission, there was a power outage and the second half was not shown. The theater offered rain checks, but I didn't bother. I watched the second half at home with much better picture and sound quality. Even my popcorn is better.

The place is a grand old palace. The sing-alongs are fun, and there’s always a nice crowd, but don’t go for the presentation quality.<//review>

Went to the last San Francisco show of ex-MST3K movie commentary funnyfolk, Cinematic Titanic, in 2011.  It was a night I will never forget! The comedy team hung around after the show to talk to their loving fans, which the Castro Theatre made easy for them. This theatre is a long time Frisco landmark.</text>

Castro Theater is a gift to everyone who visits it. From the moment you walk in and smell the organic popcorn with real butter to taking your seats and listening to the live organ player you are transported to a vintage happy place.
The organ comes up out of the floor like Posiden rising up from a storm sea! It’s huge and the music is just the coolest thing. Everyone applauds loudly when the musician is done playing and then it goes back down under the floor and the movie starts. The whole room with an upper balcony is beautifully restored. A historic landmark.

They have film festivals, like Frameline and the Jewish Film Festival every year, and classic movies, singalongs and current films. It’s a great venue on all fronts.</review>

<rating>5</rating><Text>Very classic old time movie house.  There is an old organ inside that would accompany movies.  Very grandiose feel.

Lobby is quaint and food selections are about what you would expect.

We went on a sing a long of the sound of music and they prepared for us a bag of goodies used to accompany the film.  It was a hoot.  We even sat next to a group of singing nuns.  People come dressed for the occasion.

Work this into your schedule it is not to be missed.< /Text>< Name>

<Review>Beloved grand old movie palace, lovingly cared for. Screens classic movies, art house films, film festivals, sing-alongs and some first runs. If you love movies, you'll love this place. The anchor for the Castro District  Historical landmark for so many reasons. Sound and film qualities maintained to industry standards. ADA rest room. Parking difficult, but not impossible. Recommend MUNI Metro to Castro station. Couldn't be easier.<//Review><Gmap_id>0x808f7e1b4ff86179:0x14fad42ba6399425<//Gmap_id>< Rate>

A gorgeous old theatre with comfortable seats.  I've seen two shows here - both from the main floor.  I had no difficulty seeing the stage and performers without getting blocked by people in the row ahead of me.  There was enough leg room to stretch out a little also.

There's popcorn and a few snacks but no alcohol served at the theatre bar.</text>

Went to see Gloria Steinem speak. Great atmosphere in one of San Francisco's historic treasures. We sat upstairs where you can reallt appreciate the architecture of Timothy Pflueger who also designed Alameda's theater.<//Text>

<text>Beautiful and perfectly maintained, the Castro theater is a main hub In the neighborhood. They have a calendar of classic movies published every month with many of the greatest films of all time showing often. Sound of music singalong is definitely the highlight , can't recommend it enough.< /text><gmap_id>0x808f7e1b4ff86179:0x14fad42ba6399425< /gmap_id><resp>None</resp>< rate>

This theater is historic and has great shows, but I hate that I can't walk down the street without getting winked at or hit on by gay men. Also, walking to the theater you might see a few exposed penis' along the way. On the educational side, I now know how attractive women feel walking past a construction site.</Review>

Really neat theatre! Only (minor) gripes were seating and audio. The seats were eh, not bad but not the most comfortable. For a comedy cast, they had speakers on the sides, which were painfully loud for people that sat anywhere near them.<//review>

Interesting, old, indi, sing a longs, commercial, any type of good movies shown here. An amazing organ, and organ player, that comes out before the show starts and plays for a short time. Easy to access, great food and drinks options around.< /text>

An old theater located just off of Castro and Market. This place has its charm and is used to feature any and all types of events. I went there particularly to see a "Singalong" of the movie Grease. Singalongs are where the movie is shown and the whole audience sings along when the movie characters starts singing, and lyrics are shown at the bottom of the screen (it was a fun thing to do with friends, which I would not mind doing again).</Text>

< review>
The films shown here range from the ridiculous "sing-alongs" (Little Mermaid,  Frozen) once a month to true classics noone should miss (Doctor Zhivago, Vertigo). The interior and organ solo are worth the price of a ticket alone. If you want to know what it was like to see a movie in the Golden Age of Hollywood this is the place to go.< /review>

This is one of many beautiful theatres around San Francisco.  It was built in 1922 featuring a Spanish Colonial Baroque style facade.  Interior is very plush and ornate, capped off with an over the top extravagant Art Deco Period chanellier.  The original 1920's Werlitzer organ is still used on occassion.< /Text>

That being a genuine pipe organ which rises from the floor to the stage level.  They often host sing-a-long movies like Baz Luhrman's Moulin Rouge or The Sound of Music.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

The Casto Theatre is the coolest theatre I've ever been to. From the classic architecture to the organ they sometimes bring up prior to showtime this place is great. Make sure to check out their schedule as they usually only show 1 movie a night.< /Review>

It's an old fashioned theater with ornate decorations and beauty.
However it misses 5 stars because I really like the stadium seating and big chairs of the modern theaters.<//Review>

<review>I usually come here for the Noir City film festival. I dress up and haul all the way out to the City to watch other people's bad luck in black and white, and it's glorious. Most people dress up to go to this event, there's specialty cocktails at intermission along with concessions downstairs (they have It's Its!), and the second story has vendors relating to the event, like pulp fiction, makeup, and Noir City merchandise.

The theater itself is BEAUTIFUL inside - vaulted ceiling with gilded carvings, a second story balcony, velvet stadium seating, and a stage in front of the single screen. They even have an organ! It's a gorgeous example of an old time movie theater, and it feels like the kind of place to dress up for, even if it's not Noir City time. I love it. This would be a great place to bring a date, especially because of the fabulous food and drinks around here for nibbles before or after. Cannot recommend enough!< /review><date>1549009335455< /date><Resp>None<//Resp>< Rate>

What can I say about the Castro Theatre? It's an icon on its own, it's more than a movie theatre. It's an architectural jewelry that we're so lucky to have in San Francisco.  If you want to have fun, go to one of the sing-a-long's movies !< /Review>

Beautiful theater! Not too big, would have been better to hold the event I went to in a larger location. No parking, but directly across the street from Muni.</review>

The Castro Theater is a downright delicious time! You just feel excited when you walk in. They show such gem movies, so definitely check out their website for a list of what they will be playing during the month.Someone usually plays the organ before the film which is such a classic touch. The old school theater seats make trying to hold a dates hand or cuddle rather difficult, so just sit back and revel in your feature film! Easy to get to from Muni, but parking around there can take some serious work and eagle eyes.<//Review>

<text>I saw a movie here and enjoyed it. The sound wasn't as good as a Century or AMC, but I didn't expect that. I had to sit all the way in the rear of the theater but it didn't affect my perspective nor viewing experience. And this is a big theater!</text>< user_name>

<text>This is probably the greatest gem in Castro. They play a mix of old and new movies so there is something for everyone! In addition, the actual theatre has a 1920's decor that you will find nowhere else, I guarantee it. Lastly, theres a lot of opportunities for double features that will give you the most bang for your buck!< /text><gmapID>0x808f7e1b4ff86179:0x14fad42ba6399425</gmapID><pictures>None<//pictures><name>Shane Colombo<//name>< Response>

One of SF's iconic spaces, the Castro is a beautiful theater and a great venue for any event. I really enjoy the movie programming and one of my favorite things is catching the organ player before a screening.<//text>

A classic movie theater with an organ player who starts out each show. The theater hosts a great mix of classic cinema, newish releases, camp and cult classics, live speaking events with celebrities and my two favorites the little mermaid sing along and Any show that known drag celebrity Peaches Christ reincarnates.<//Review>

<Review>One of the last remaining single large theatres in the Bay Area.  This is a place that makes you feel nostalgic.  This place is the same as it has been since it started way back in the day.  Try to catch a film here or some special event if it's your first time because it may not last any longer.< /Review>< pictures>

Ok theatre in a convenient place. Limited movie options. Older interior. Popular with the local Castro Valley crowd and kids. Family friendly.</Text>

It's cool because it's a landmark in a way. But as far as theaters and venues go, this one is mediocre. Terribly sound and views vary a lot depending on your seat.<//Text>

<Review>Amazing theater! Check out the website for continuously updated showings of classic movies and even live shows!! I've seen such gems as The Exorcist 2 and The Goonies here! The theater is gorgeous inside and whenever I visit I always seem to be transported in time when I sit down.< /Review></record>

What a grand theatre with a live organist who plays music on the Whirlitzer before each show. Double features make the $13 ticket price less  costly. Too bad the box office doesn't offer a student discount.

The seats aren't the most comfortable, yet the grandeur of yesteryear makes one forget about the discomfort. If one is phyically disabled, the restrooms are downstairs and there's no elevator to get there.

The Jewish film festival makes me keep coming back.<//text>

Such a charming little theater. I love old theaters with character. There are so few of them left now. It's such a privilege to have one that is still thriving in SF. I went twice for BAHFest and really want to come back for a sing-a-long. I have my eyes on the Beauty and the Beast one. Watch out kids! Don't steal my spotlight!<//review>

The hills are alive with the sound of music! Came for the special screening and loved it. The theater is historic and beautiful with a state of the art screen, projector, and sound system to boot.<//text>

<Review>Old movie theatre. Limited in every way.  Seats, sound, and environment stale like the flavor of the popcorn.  Restroom is antiquated and in the basement.  Seems to emerge from the medieval period of movie palaces unaffected by the last 100 years of the evolution in cinemas.< /Review>< pics>

I've seen many events ranging from Sing-A-Longs to an Edgar Wright tripe feature (with Edgar Wright in attendance). Every year they host a ton of SketchFest events, including the Twilight roast. I feel like they put a lot of effort into being original and eclectic.<//Text>

Such an ideal community space! The Castro theatre hosts Disney singalongs, indie films, film festivals, drag shows, etc.

There's always something going on there, and it's conveniently right outside MUNI. Before your show, it's easy to grab a bite in the Mission too.

Organ playing before shows is always a nice touch.< /Review>

Let's be real: The Castro theatre is heaven on Earth. It's a magical, gaudy, single-screen venue that continues to weather economic storms. Before special events, you'll delight at the organist who plays you into the films. Numerous double or triple bills give you insane bang for your buck.

There is likely no one reading this who hasn't been to the Castro Theatre. But if you haven't, GO. It doesn't matter what's playing! GO. If you're visiting town, and you don't take a couple hours to check out a program at the Castro, you haven't seen one of San Francisco's true landmarks.</review>

Cool theater. Visited it for the first time during SFSketch Fest. Big show room. Drinks were a little pricey though.<//Review>

Always love the Castro Theatre. Some of my most memorable movie experiences have been here. And the ambiance just can't be beat. I mean, c'mon! an organ arrises out of the stage whilst the organist plays intro music at the start of the flick. Class. Classic.</text>

Yes, this theater is iconic and beautiful - most of it. I came here to watch Margaret Cho and the seats were worn down. Margaret was also very political with her performance and did not enjoy it one bit - waste of money.

Would love to come back again and give it another try though.< /text>

Do not miss the sing-a-longs. It's a very fun thing to do with any movie. Energies are great. Not suitable for kids (too crowded and noisy plus they won't appreciate the historical value)</text>

<Text>Been here many times, and never had a bad experience. The staff are very nice and welcoming, along with all of the clientel. All seats are comfortable and have good views and acoustics. The theater company works very hard to bring many special events and people to the theater and are a great adition to the gay community.</Text><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

<review>You cannot check out the Castro District without stopping by the Castro Theatre - definitely a historic icon of the area.  Where else can you find a Little Mermaid Singalong??

Word of advice - use public transit to get to the Castro because parking is a DISASTER here :)</review></record>

Stunning building. Never miss the Noir City festival nor SF SketchFest - such very different festivals, & so wonderful to enjoy them in this stunning theater. Cinematic Titanic or dark '40s fare, I can't think of a better venue. And seeing Milk here on an activism fundraising night with the perfect local crowd, then exiting the theater and being THERE where it all happened - magical.</Review>

<text>The Castro Theater is one of those places where movies just seem to come alive, and you are transported to another era. From the sound of the grand organ before the movie starts, to the amazing decorations of an era long gone by, The Castro never ceases to inspire and make the movie-going experience something special.</text></record></dataset><record>

The Castro is an urban treasure and large cavernous theater, too! Great place to watch the restored silent, The Lost World, with great, live accompaniment by the Alloy Orchestra.<//Text>

Had the wonderful privilege of viewing the The Chinese Exclusion Act documentary premiere here (via CAAM Fest). Beautiful, historical space, well-buttered popcorn with DIY salt and nutritional yeast (my favorite) and  friendly service. Only flaw is that the ratio of restroom/stalls to theater capacity was way, way off. Perhaps there were more restrooms upstairs, but the downstairs line was insane...< /text>

<review>SF Landmark and just a beautiful theatre. Known for sing-alongs and musical features. Designed by renown architect Timothy L. Pflueger, this is a definite stop for tourists who want to learn about San Francisco architecture. Note that Pflueger also designed the Paramount Theatre (Oakland, CA), the Alameda Theatre (Alameda, CA), the Union Square Macy's bldg and a few skyscrapers on California St. and Sutter St. Other places with similar interiors are the SF Opera.</review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

Great classic theater. I only really come for the sing a longs. They do play other movies here both new and old and have a monthly schedule posted on their website. Anyone reading this should totally go to one of their sing a longs. You can dress in costume based on the movie theme and they really work hard on trying to make these things as interactive as possible. At the very least come for a sing a long you won't regret it or not the choice is yours...if you're boring. Jk. But not lol. They also serve the typical movie food: popcorn, candy, soda with a side of nutritional yeast (taste like cheese, smells like wet dog, totally nutritional though, did I mention the cheese part?) Anyway tell them Andrew sent you and get an akward look lol.</Text>

<review>Beautiful theater. The seats aren’t super comfortable and depending on where you’re sitting you may not get a great view, but it’s a neighborhood gem.</review>< Name>

<text>The wonderful retro look and feel adds deeply when you get to attend the Noir Film Festival, and certainly a lot of nostalgia since the Frameline camps mostly out of this most iconic and accommodating family owned space.  The family does take care of the space which is costly, and though evident it's hard to keep up, they manage to do so, albeit a bit behind but not unsafe as this is a popular screening space for the many sing-alongs little girls have memorized by heart, big girls who tend to the little girl inside, and all the Moms & Dad's who love to spend the afternoon w/their little and their hundreds of little friend throughout the year.  They have real butter for their popcorn, too.  And finally for me, it's only a few blocks away and while rarely do they get first runs, they sometimes get them bearing the tailend run in the premium mall boxes.  Sometimes there's a double feature.  If you haven't been it's a great option awaiting your special screening of an old favorite on the large screen.😆< /text>< pics>

San Francisco Registered Landmark - one of the few grand movie theaters from the 1920's still in operation. They use real butter on the popcorn!<//Review>

< Review>
The wonderful retro look and feel adds deeply when you get to attend the Noir Film Festival, and certainly a lot of nostalgia since the Frameline camps mostly out of this most iconic and accommodating family owned space.  The family does take care of the space which is costly, and though evident it's hard to keep up, they manage to do so, albeit a bit behind but not unsafe as this is a popular screening space for the many sing-alongs little girls have memorized by heart, big girls who tend to the little girl inside, and all the Moms & Dad's who love to spend the afternoon w/their little and their hundreds of little friend throughout the year.  They have real butter for their popcorn, too.  And finally for me, it's only a few blocks away and while rarely do they get first runs, they sometimes get them bearing the tailend run in the premium mall boxes.  Sometimes there's a double feature.  If you haven't been it's a great option awaiting your special screening of an old favorite on the large screen.😆</Review>

I love the Castro Theatre. I've seen mainstream movies, choruses, independant film screenings, participated in sing-alongs, and everything in between here. Their calendar is varied and always changing. Many of the events can be found on Goldstar for half price, but the full price tickets are usually pretty reasonable as well. Be patient and purchase tickets to popular showing in advance as the lines can get long (though they move fast). Inside, the historic theatre is gorgeous. The lobby isn't much to see but the interior is very old timey and you will be amazed by that organ.</text>

<Review>It's like going to a theater in a different era. The seats aren't as comfortable, you don't have the great stadium seating, but they have an organ! And a live organist!

If you are a movie buff, and you are near the Castro, you must stop by for a show.<//Review>< Date>

It's like going to a theater in a different era. The seats aren't as comfortable, you don't have the great stadium seating, but they have an organ! And a live organist!

If you are a movie buff, and you are near the Castro, you must stop by for a show.< /text>

(Translated by Google) Historic theater located in the Castro district, which has always been the center of the LGBT cultural and private life. The building has been in its current address since 1920. It has a Spanish colonial style facade with a large glass facade on the façade. The hall, as well as for theatrical performances is also used as a cinema, has 1400 seats. Its vertical luminous sign is visible from most of the city.

(Translated by Google) The theater dates back to the early 1920s and has a Spanish colonial style. The room also serves as a cinema. The interior is rather luxurious with gold trim. At the Castro Theater you can watch film retrospectives and festivals.

(Original)
Il teatro risale ai primi anni venti del XX secolo e presenta uno stile coloniale spagnolo. La sala fa anche da cinema. L’interno è piuttosto lussuoso con rifiniture in oro. Al Castro Theatre si può assistere a retrospettive cinematografiche e festival.</Review>

<Text>(Translated by Google) This is the base camp of the LGBTQ group. It is very full of love and peace. There are also very cute rainbow zebra crossings on the ground, and there are many small shops selling people who are blushing! It is one of the classic attractions not to be missed in San Francisco. It is recommended to walk around.

(Translated by Google) What's more satisfying than watching Bullit and his famous chase scene in which Steve Mcqueen thrills the horses of his powerful Mustang in the streets of San Francisco at the Castro Theater! And to top it off, we had the right to a vintage organ concert before the screening. So kitch but so authentic :-) I loved it.

(Original)
Quoi de plus satisfaisant que de regarder Bullit et sa fameuse scène de course poursuite lors de laquelle Steve Mcqueen fait vrombir les chevaux de sa puissante Mustang dans les rues de San Francisco au Castro Theatre ! Et pour couronner le tout, nous avons eu le droit à un concert d'orgue vintage avant la projection. Tellement kitch mais tellement authentique :-) J'ai adoré.</review>
