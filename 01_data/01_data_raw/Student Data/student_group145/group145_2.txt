<text>The property manager company itself, 1 star. If that… However, Anna it’s by far the most professional, understanding, educating and customer service friendly employee within this company. She has gone far above and beyond in comparison to her colleagues. I have had numerous issues with incompleteness from the maintenance dept, leasing, etc. Anna responded to all my concerns and escalated my concerns to the appropriate people and has consistently checked to see if the issue is resolved. If I had the opportunity to only work with her, trust that I would. She exemplifies all the expectations one would have of a professional. I surely do hope her management sees this review and considers it. In my 5 years, she is the only person I have had a positive experience with. So very thankful for her, she may just restore the faith.</text>< Pictures>

I love how Anna takes care of her job, she's very patient and helpful. Five star is not enough to rate her. I could even give 10 or more. Keep it up!< /Review>

Honestly they are the first great experience I’ve ever had with any property management company! I would like to personally thank Anna as she is on top of everything-- she explained how the new lease and renter's insurance work and get me in touch with the maintenance people! I would very confidently recommend. Thanks!<//review>< UserId.>

I absolutely love Ms. Mary! She is super sweet and helpful! She has helped us with everything we have needed, and gets everything done in a timely manner. Maintenance sometimes takes awhile but that’s understandable with the amount of properties they cover.< /Review>

The manager is rude. They are not making repairs to properties due to covid. I asked for repairs and then got a termination of tenancy. I can’t say enough about how this company is a scam.< /Review>

<Review>If I can give zero stars I would! I moved into my apartment in April every month my electricity bill has been over $200 this month my bill is $460 because their lack of hiring someone reliable to fix the A/C correctly or simply just replacing it with a new A/C unit. The first time their A/C repairman came out was on 5/28 and returned on 5/29 to only replace a fan without checking anything else or cleaning the unit correctly, then I submit a new maintenance request on 7/11 and get an automatic reply stating I’d be charged if nothing is wrong! Seriously obviously something is wrong if I have my A/C set at 75 degrees and it’s reading 82 degrees and the A/C is constantly running without automatically shutting off like it should. While all this is happening I had to purchase a small A/C from Lowe’s to keep my kids fresh!<//Review>< pics>

Each time I have called the Porterville, CA office, I have received excelent customer service. Alice is the person who has answered my phone calls and she is very professional and polite as well as patient each time.

Furthermore, I remember going to their office for something I needed to attend personally, and Alice greeted me with a warm smile and was very friendly and helpful. She is a great asset to the company.< /text>

<review>Horrible horrible place to rent from, haven’t even given us our 800$ deposit back and it’s been 2 months sense we left, place was trash when we moved in holes in the doors and didn’t even have insulation. Definitely false advertisement too didn’t have carpet or anything like it showed in the pictures, we had spent a lot of money to try and fix it up and we took 4 days off from work to clean and do the yard and leaver it in a great condition for them to rip us off and now they won’t answer us or give us any info ! The new lady is rude and now says they don’t have anything on file. We have proof of everything . I miss the old ladies in the office.

<rating>1</rating><review>Adena, the front office receptionist told me that if the 5th was on a Sunday, that we renters would not get a late fee. I have never been late before so today is the 6th, a Monday and I take my rent check in and the manager says I have to pay an extra $130.00 along with 10 other renters who "tried to slip their rent check under the door this morning" and that it doesn't matter what Adena told me she is no longer working there, and to read my contract". I am a good renter from them for 2 years. Lousy treatment of good renters. I need a good reference someday so I am just biting my time...< /review><pics>None< /pics><response>{'time': 1578525381926, 'text': 'Marie, we apologize greatly for the inconvenience and miscommunication regarding this issue.

We have rented from Real Property Management Evergreen more then once we have always had a good experience . If for any reason we needed any assistance with anything to do with the rental unit. We could always count on Adina and Estella to help us out as quick as possible. These ladies definitely are a great help. I would definitely use Real Property Management Evergreen again if need be.

Terrible land management!  Money hungry people.
All they want is to charge fees for everything. Porterville office is the worst. You wont get your deposit back. You'll regret renting from them. Another thing, their lawn service people steals plants. In response to my post, after approximately 9 "nine" years of renting from the the previous company and real property,  Normal wear and tear should be no issue.  We paid our rent on time and had no problems and we got ripped off.  Nine years and things break down and the OWNERS should be responsible, that's why we pay rent.  Don't let them tell you it was a disgruntled renter.</Text>

<Text>Money hungry for sure.. I'm not a renter but I'm speaking out for someone who is. The way they handle their "customer service" is so bad.. when something is out of your control they charge you for it. They don't communicate with you and charge you extra on your rent for nothing and put a fancy name on it. Again I am speaking out for someone else because who knows what they will do to them after reading the review. I know the company is gonna try to reach out and tell me to call someone or that they can find me as a tenant.  But it's just not right how they treat people< /Text>< Pictures>

It’s been 3 weeks and our AC is still broken. They gave us a portable AC but that just means one room is cold so we have been sleeping in our living room for the last 3 weeks. Because it’s not a California law to have a working AC 😒😒 as Joan said but every time we call “your AC will be fixed in the next 48 hours”. More like it will be fixed the next 100,000 hours. It’s been more than 100 degrees every damn day since our AC broke and we’re the top apartment so it’s even worse. Go rent from someone else it’s not worth it here, the old owners of the apartments we live if got more stuff done then the real Property Management.< /review>

DISHONEST GROUP THAT SEEKS TO CHEAT PEOPLE THAT DON'T UNDERSTAND THE LAW. THEY USE A WEAK CONTRACT THAT IS IN THE PROCESS OF BEING CHALLENGED TO TRY CHEAT PEOPLE OUT OF THEIR DEPOSIT MONEY. I KNOW A FAMILY THAT HAD $1,300 STOLEN BY THIS COMPANY... NEVER SET FOOT IN A RESIDENCE MANAGED BY THIS FIRM AND THEY WANT TO KEEP THEIR DEPOSIT. THEY SHOULD FEEL ASHAMED OF THEMSELVES... ESPECIALLY JOANN, BUT I GUESS THE LOVE OF MONEY IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN BEING AN HONEST AND STRAIGHTFORWARD PROFESSIONAL<//Review>

RPM PORTERVILLE has proven to have a reliable and trustworthy team.

We have lived in our apartment, which is managed by RPM, going on 6 years. Any time we required maintenance assistance,  it was provided in a timely manner. Once we needed emergency plumbing on a Sunday night around 7:00 pm. Surely,  we thought,  nothing would would happen until the next day.  We were pleasantly surprised when our door bell rang and there stood a plumber ready to help within 20 minutes of my phone call to their emergency number.  This speaks volumes about their commitment to provide excellent service to their renters.
I sincerely cannot say enough about the office team. They listen first then react with positive solutions. The maintenance team provides top-notch service, are very polite, and answer questions patiently.
Do not hesitate to do business with this incredible team.

Great job the the RPM team! Especially Estela, she always goes above and beyond to make sure my properties are taken care of! I am really comfortable being an out of state property owner, RPM provides me with all of the tools necessary along with thorough updates so I am aware of my investments. Thank you Estela and RPM!

<Text>I honestly could not be more satisfied with the level of customer service and attention to detail that RPME provided my daughter and myself,  We showed up a little early to our appointment to see the house and Adina Grenfell, the service agent was right there when we got there.  She walked us through our tour showing us all the amazing features of the property.  Answered all of our questions honestly and openly.  I would recommend them to anyone in the process of moving or seeking a new residence.  They even showed me alternatives to what I was looking at.  Very diligent and a pleasure to work with.  Thanks again Adina and RPME.<//Text><pics>None</pics>< username>

The manager is very unprofessional, she is very judgemental and makes decisions on hear say, she should not be in that position and allowed to control other people's lives. Whenever My family had questions during the lease signing the manager was not present and the girl she used to get the job done could not answer any of our questions or concerns. Oh if you rent through yhis company be prepared for alot of extra charges after you have paid the deposit!!<//Text>

<Text>They are a dishonest company. They do not stand by their word. They will take almost all of your deposit (we are now finding that this is a common practice of theirs). The manager is unprofessional and inconsiderate. They blatantly break California laws. They see their tenants as numbers and dollar signs. When I contacted the BBB the manager blatantly lied about our case.<//Text>< Time>

< Review>
I have had two viewings of the property's listed under this company. Yesterday I showed up for my viewing and the home was not cleaned yet. The bathroom tub and countertops, cabinets were filthy not even wiped up, The home smelt of cigerate smoke or animal pee, and fresh paint, I said somthing regarding the smell in the home, and the agent replied by saying (IT SMELLS BETTER IN HERE THAN IT DID BEFORE). I thought to myself (what did it smell like before thats gross).Yesterday I also called to veiw two more property's and the lady I spoke with on the phone was very nice. She scedualed a viewing for me today at 2 pm, but about 30 minutes prior to my viewing on roby, I received a text asking if she could reschedule the viewing for Friday, I said no it's not ok with me, that I had been riding around with my baby in the car waiting for the viewing. I then got a reply, that she would try her hardest to make it there.  Then she didn't even show up, another agent did for her, and that agent didn't even have the keys to the property to show me it on roby. We then drove to another property on Mathew, which is a nice home, but it was also not clean, just like the one I viewed yesterday on Henderson. There were bandaids on the floor in the bathroom. And there were some maintenance issues that most defiantly should be fixed prior to viewings. Such as molding or trimmings around the floor some of those places were missing.  To me it is unprofessional for a rental agency to be showing homes if they haven't been cleaned out professionally before viewings. Or if there are maintenance issues that need attended to as well. I'm not even sure I want to veiw the house on roby now. As it was a waste of my time and my son's to drive around waiting to see the home today. Then the agent didn't even have the keys to the property and didn't even try to rescedual a appointment. Also while I was in the home on Mathew I asked the agent why her co worker wanted to rescedual with me? And she replied by saying her co worker was taking a lunch! Everyone has the right of course to take a lunch working for any employer but then again, she should have took her lunch earlier to stick to the scedual that she had made instead of trying to rescedual with me because she was taking her lunch at 2pm. Or at least that's what her co worker stated.

Unprofessional sorry,</Review>

Great sushi and service. Loved it. Chef worked under Nobu. Has unique items. The Spanish mackerel was the best I have tasted. Seared red snapper was Excellent. Seared fatty tuna with truffles was delicious.  Cod sperm snack, baby squid, baby eel all good. $$$< /Review>

Very fresh. They pride themselves on freshness. Be sure to eat here. They are amazing. The taste, the service, the people. The second time we went there (months after the first time), they remembered us and asked where our daughter was! The black cod is to die for-- dissolves in your mouth! If I had to choose one food to eat the rest of my life-- their red snapper would probably be it, and I say it every time! Salmon is fantastic. Tuna belly awesome. And like I said-- the servers are so nice and so happy to see you. I would like to see this place full every night. Good for kids too-- they will accommodate and automatically do not put wasabi on kids sushi.< /Review>

<rating>5</rating><text>The sushi here is consistently delicious.  The sushi selection on the special menu changes often, reflecting the availability of whatever happens to be especially fresh.

The prices are commensurate with the quality, which is to say that going there is a splurge, but it is definitely worthwhile.

Service is very friendly, though a little on the slow side.  I attribute it to greater attentiveness for all customers versus inattentiveness to anyone.</text><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

<Text>If you know your sushi this place will not disappoint!  My husband and I first went to Chitose but they told us an hour wait!  No thanks.  We drove around and found this little gem and we hit gold!  The rice was perfectly aldente, the nori was crisp and favorful.  Their 10 piece sushi with hand roll was $48 and totally worth it.  Please please don't dunk the sushi in soy sauce if you decide to try this place.  People should go online and learn how to eat sushi before trying this place.  You should enjoy the taste of the fish, good quality fish this place serves.<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

<Review>Waited 50 minutes on a late Sunday night to eat a small plate of sushi and waited total 90 minutes to eat 2 dozen. One waitress covering nearly all the tables and hiding most of the time. You bet the waitress didnt apologize for the waiting. Overpriced, lesser quality, and smaller portion than other Torrance establishments and will not be coming here ever. Most disappointing and frustrating dining experience.< /Review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

Very tasty sushi, great service, relaxed comfortable environment. On the more expensive side, roughly $4 per nigiri, market price for the daily specials. They had Santa Barbara sweet shrimp the night I went and I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys sweet shrimp. Plus near a pokestop if you want to grab items while waiting for the next delicious serving ;). My order of 8 nigiri and a handroll came out to $47 before tax and tip.<//text>

< Review>
Ahmed is a magician with the scissors!

I'm originally from New York and after moving to Irvine in 2018, finding a barber wasn't easy.

The cheap barber for $25 will cut your hair in 5-10 mins. A $40 haircut from supercuts or Danckut's is inconsistent because the barber keeps changing and overall not worth the price.

Ahmed's consistent haircut is high quality for only $35! I usually leave with a good tip because he does such a good job!

What attracted me to his shop was the 100+ positive yelp reviews. What kept me coming back was the confidence boost I get from a haircut from Tesoro.

He knows exactly how to style my hair without needing lots of details. After a while, I just ask for the usual and it comes out perfect every time.

Ahmed is a one man show and for good reason. No one can do a better job than this craftsman!

If you're in the Orange county area you MUST visit this man and see the transformation happen before your eyes!< /Review>

I am NOT the type to pay over $20 for a haircut. With so many salons closed, I really wanted one and bit the bullet with this $35 haircut and it was worth every single penny. Ahmed is amazing at what he does. During my first visit, I got my eyebrows threaded (he's AMAZING at this) but wasn't ready to cut my hair yet; Ahmed offered to give me a free trim in the back because my hair grows faster there. I returned a second time to get a full haircut with him and was so impressed. His attention to detail and passion for his craft was truly evident when I saw the finished product. I plan on returning to Ahmed for a long time and hope that others check him out too!</Review>

I have been in need of a personal barber for a while and just could not find consistency any where! I am pleased to say I am no longer in search. This shop is simply AMAZING! They over deliver and have a loyal client in myself!! Thanks Tesoro Barber & Salon👑🙏🏾</review>

Just moved to the area and didn’t think I would find someone to replace my old barber. Ahmed proved me wrong. He’s great with the clippers and scissors, and made my hair look exactly how I asked. Worth every penny.< /Text>

<review>Ahmed was excellent! I have been looking around for a barber who understands hair and not just how to physically cut hair.  I came in with some messed up previous hair cuts and Ahmed worked his magic bringing me to one of my favorite haircuts in a long time.  It has been 3 days since my haircut and I still catch myself admiring it.  He gets straight to the point and doesn't waste your time. He was also great with scheduling too as I called same day and he made it work for me.<//review><Rate>5< /Rate>< Time>

Well.. this was the first time I tried the salon. I have to say I am very happy with my beard and hair now. Ahmed spent a lot of time trimming my hair and beard to make it look perfect. I will definitely recommend the place to everyone.<//Review>

He’s very fast, efficient, and gave me a a high-quality cut every time I’ve visited him. Will be going back again; he’s won a loyal customer! He’s a genuinely good guy that works hard and puts his customers first. He takes pride in his work and to top it all off, the price is extremely reasonable for the area!< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

Tesoro Salon is one of the best hair salons that I have ever been to. Ahmed is very personable, friendly and nice to talk to. More importantly, the way he cuts hair is very professional and amazing. The prices are fair and the results are always top-notch.< /Text>

This place is the spot to go. Ahmad is a true professional and is probably the best barber in the area hands down. You can tell this guy has been doing this for years.</Text>

I live in Washington DC and did not find the time before a vacation to get a hair cut, so I relied on reviews for barbers near me to find a spot.  I am extremely happy I chose Ahmed's Tesoro Salon.  One of the best haircut's I have received.  He definitely enjoys his work and cares about the final product.  Would definitely recommend to friends.</review>

Attention to detail is key and he was spot on.  Very satisfied and definitely recommend this to my friends and family.  You will not regret, I sure didn't.  Thanks for the amazing hair cut today, see you in a month!!!</Text>

<username>Private Customer</username><Time>1553930823038< /Time><Rate>3</Rate><review>I think the owner, who is the barber, is a very personable person. It was a bit too "personable" for me, although it is better than your average retaining tactics, it is a better form.

I appreciate form. Regardless, good nature and friendliness should never substitute expertise, and boundaries, which on those two, there was a subtle lack.

I called for an appointment, I asked for a time and price, I was quote $30.

I had two pictures with me, but the length of the cut was shorter than on the picture, and the style wasn't what it shows.

I then asked him for a specific cut that is at the length it was, it was a familiar cut for me, and I have been to several locations for it. I know how long, and how many tries it should take for it to be done on skill levels. It took several communications to get close to this basic cut. I'm still going to have to go elsewhere to have it cleaned up a bit.

The entire appointment has already taken some time to complete the cut (despite his talking), and that, was brought up to me when I visited the next night to pay him in cash.

This shop doesn't accept credit cards. I hesitate using checks. It was late and so the decision was to pay him in cash the next day.

He gave me back $5 without me mentioning the price difference when I went back, I gave him back the $5 questioning him why.  I didn't see the price list until now.

I was invited to a demonstration of using wax, which I thought was nice of him. It was a brief rinse, semi-dry and the demonstration of wax over gel. There was also offerings of a string scraping thing for a facial hair found on me. Very nice of him, however expertise and professionalism will win over any gesture, that is, for me, every single time, in a business transaction.<//review>< Pictures>

Tesoro, run by the amazing hairstylist, Ahmed, is the best Men’s hair salon I’ve been to. Every time I walk in I am greeted with the warmest of welcomes. He not only does a great job with my hair but he makes me feel comfortable in his studio. Thanks for everything, Ahmed!<//Text>

<Review>Excellent experience! Alex was right on time. He was honest and very professional. He did his job and explained quickly and efficiently. I would highly recommend Brody Pennell for any AC services. Thank you Alex!</Review><GmapID>0x80c2b97e9fc3ce67:0x9ac827d6e7cba772</GmapID><Time>1618518588805</Time></record></dataset><record>

Experienced, knowledgable, trustworthy and Professional, from the sales visit, pre-walk through with the project manager to the installation.  Brody Pennell replaced an existing 1982 2 ton Day and Night HVAC unit with a new Carrier 3 ton unit. Additionally, they installed new exposed ducting with two additional registers and an additional return to accommodate the larger HVAC unit.  I was very impressed with the attention to detail and efforts to meet my needs and expectations.  The finished result and look is amazing.

When selecting a proposal, I am not necessarily looking for the lowest or cheapest bid.  I am more interested in the best quality, value and professional workmanship for a fair reasonable price. Do it once, do it right.  The job also required a crane to remove the old HVAC unit and deliver the new unit on the roof 4 floors up.  It also required scaffolding inside the condo unit and cutting through the exterior and interior walls to add the new ducting and return.

I live in an 1173 square foot condo unit with an upstairs loft space which has a 19' foot ceiling in the main living area.  The previous HVAC system did not deliver air to the upper loft area which I frequently use as a guest space. As a result, the upper loft area has always been 10 or more degrees warmer than the main level making it very uncomfortable during the summer months.  The entire space is now evenly cooled throughout and very comfortable.  The new 3 ton unit works effortlessly to cool the space and runs only a fraction of the time that the previous unit did.  Additionally, they made every effort to mitigate and reduce the noise and vibration.  I do not hear a sound when it is running and only can tell that it is running when feeling the cool air circulating throughout.

I also want to mention that Brody Pennell was the last to service my previous HVAC unit over 10 years ago which was going strong until recently.  Once again, Experienced, knowledgable, trustworthy and Professional.  Highly Recommended.<//text>

We appreciated Emmith's time and attention reviewing our AC and Furnace systems today. He was extremely personable and explained all of the steps he would be taking to confirm that all systems were in order. Thank you to both Brody Pennell and Emmith for the great service and for keeping us on track with maintenance visits at least twice a year!</Review>

This is my unsolicited positive review of the technician, Ruben Arevalo, from Brody Pennell Heating & Air Conditioning.  Ruben arrived early.  He was prompt, courteous, efficient, and took the time to explain to me what he was doing.  I was very pleased with the service that was provided on our heater.< /review>

My entire experience with Brody Pennell was excellent.  I inquired via a chat box online, someone from their scheduling depart called the next morning to schedule the service for the following day, service person arrived on time and was able to identify the problem with my Honeywell de-humidifier on the first visit.  Very impressive considering the company I purchased it from has been trying to fix it since July.  Well done Brody Pennell and Cesar Corrales.<//review>

Alex was my technician, he came on time, really professional he even brought his own covers for the shoes!  He was able to identify the problem which was not solved by other company technician.  Really happy he came to fix my AC.  From the time I booked the service, it was smooth....the phone was answered by a lady who was willing to help and all communications were confirmed with follow up texts.  I highly recommend this company when you need AC service.</text>

We had water coming into our office from the roof mounted AC unit which was causing damage to documents and furniture.  We called Brody-Pennell and they came out to service the unit the next day.  They determined the issue, provided photos and a thorough description of the problem, then gave us a reasonable price for repair all in approximately 30 minutes.  Brody-Pennell then proceeded with the repair the same day.  No more leaks!  Their service is worth every penny.<//Text>

Had the part on them, and fixed it in under 30 minutes, for under $320, including labor! Right before a heat wave.

<Time>1559942491840</Time><Rate>5<//Rate><Review>Another great experience with Brody Pennell this morning.  I had an appointment for midday but was contacted earlier in the morning with the opportunity to move the appointment to the morning.  I appreciated the chance and had a technician at my door within 30 minutes.

I was happy to see a familiar face at the door as the technician had been to our home before and knew the house.  He was very kind and pleasant, and knows his job well.  He serviced our central heating / air unit quickly and was very conscientious to work cleanly as well.

Brody Pennell as a company, as well as there skilled technicians, are simply great!< /Review>< Pics>

I am the Building Manager of a 25 unit apartment building in Brentwood. We have been using Brody Pennell for the last few years and have been very satisfied. We have found their work to be consistently good and pricing, based on past experience, to be fair. They handle all emergency problems for us, and in addition, we are on a quarterly maintenance program with them. I have been particularly pleased with the service provided by one of their people, Alex Nah. I ask for Alex to service the account because I find him diligent, knowledgeable, hard working and personable. All these are qualities that my tenants appreciate as much as I do. I definitely expect this relationship to continue. Just had Alex here a couple of days ago and each time here he impresses me more and more with his knowledge and his ability to interact with our tenants. He and the company continue be 5 stars in my book.<//review>

Alex Nah showed up as scheduled, right on time. He explained the program thouroughly and proceeded to check all our equipment. He was very professional and knowledgeable. He changed the filter on our unit and charged the refrigerant. Before he left he went over all instructions of operation. He even vacuumed up any mess and left the work area in pristine condition. His work was very commendable and left my wife and myself extremely satisfied! Good luck and thank you Alex, we feel you will have a great future with your company! Thank you.<//Review>

I have used Brody - Pennell twice. The first time was for a rental property and the second time was for my own home. In the rental property we replaced two units on two levels of a large townhouse. That was almost two years ago. The process was seamless and Ken the Comfort Consultant is very nice to work with. The air conditioners are working beautifully and Brody- Pennell gave us the best bid of the three companies I called for an estimate. So when my husband and I decided it was time to put air-conditioning in our home after living without it for 25 years, I called Ken and I did not bother to call anyone else for an estimate. This company had already earned my trust. It turned out that our furnace and ducts also needed replacement. Ken provided a fair estimate. We did have to wait a bit of time for the appointment with Ken, as well as for the installation appointment. This is because the company is in high demand and they will only send out their highly trained best people. They are worth the wait. The installation people were even compassionate with me  as I happened to be going through a very difficult time with my ill dog at the time they were here. I highly recommend this company.<//text>

I was recommended by a friend of mine who used them before for air-conditioning service repair,  they were really quick and coming out versus some other companies wanted days they were out within hours, first of all they fix the problem for a very low cost they also warned me about a electrical issue that could cause a fire and he was nice enough to fix it the following day for only a service fee call of around less then $100. I would definitely recommend to any 1 looking for honest hvac service in the Beverly Hills area. Fast and dependable service.< /review>

Brody Pennell has done the installation and maintenance for both our houses spanning 35 years.  We have had many service people attend to our needs, but by far Alex Nah is the best technician of all time! Alex is professional and beyond capable able to address every question and concern with experience and knowledge.  Brody Pennell is fortunate to have Alex part of their team!</text>

<Review>I found a referral for Brody Pennell on Nextdoor when our A/C broke during a heat wave. They weren't available to help me at exactly the moment I wanted because they were busy helping their contracted clients, but the service agent I spoke with remembered me and called a day later to let me know he had an opening in his schedule for me. That won me over and now I am a contracted client. They always provide friendly, reliable and honest service. Rene has been our service provider the past two visits and he is always polite and professional. I am happy to recommend them!< /Review></record></dataset><record>

Excellent work!  All around my experience was old school solid contracting work well done with a pleasurable crew who were able to solve my challenging AC installation.  I did my due diligence in getting multiple quotes - clearly a superior company.  Highly recommend.< /Review>

My heater stopped working last month during the cold spell we experienced a couple weeks ago.  I called Brody Pennell whom I've been using to service my a/c/heater unit for the last 20 years.  Alex arrived during the scheduled window period and covered his shoes with booties before entering my condo.  He determined that my unit just needed some freon.  However, Alex went above and beyond while inspecting and adding freon to the compressor which is located on the roof and not easily accessible.  I really appreciate the lengths Alex went through to resolve my heating issues and will continue to call upon Brody Pennell whenever I need excellent service.</Text>

Brody Pennell was responsive to our needs. We were looking after two sick grand children at home, the furnace was not working and the forecast was predicting 37 degree temperature for that night.  Alex was quick and  accurate in trouble shouting the problem and we had all systems working by early the next morning. Very satisfied...< /text>

Every aspect of this process was as smooth and stress-free as it could've been, given the circumstances. The various techs who came out to my place were all on-time, helpful, and very knowledgeable about what they were doing. They even worked with me to come up with a solution that fit my price range and didn't try to blindly upsell me. Great experience.</Text>

< Review>
I had a something stuck in my HVAC fan that was making a terrible noise, as well as needed a yearly check up. I called several places and no one was available - or they were trying to charge me for extra services due to the fan issue.  I called Brody Pennell  Heating & Air Conditioning and they were awesome from the moment they answered the phone - scheduled us for next day, booked us for the regular maintenance knowing that the tech would have to service the fan anyways (honest!), and from there everything was great. 7am on the dot next day, tech arrived, was super pleasant and got to work. He was quick, super friendly and helpful and found the source of the noise (a piece of paper). I will absolutely make them my FIRST call for HVAC service!! Thank you!!!</Review>

Great Customer Service! I would highly recommend this company to the family and friends! Our technician Cesar Corrales came on-time and  with a great smile! We needed to install NEST  Thermostat for our A/C. He explained the  whole process and answered all my questions and guided me through the set up with  our WI FI and set up our A/C  in high efficiency  mode setting. He also showed how to navigate through all available modes (cooling, heating, fan, heating/cooling, etc.) and how to adjust the temperature if we need to, instead of just leaving me with Instruction Guide to figure on my own. Cesar is very knowledgeable, hard-working,  and courteous. He went above and beyond of my expectations for the service we needed! I am very happy and satisfied with the job that was done just right! Great personality and excellent skills! Ask Cesar and you won't be disappointed!< /text>

The True Measure of a Contractor

It’s easy to give a company high marks when everything goes smoothly. But let’s face it, sometimes things don’t go smoothly. And the true measure of a contractor is revealed in how they respond when things go wrong. Brody Pennell simply sets the standard that all others should aspire to.

In a nutshell, my wife and I hired these wonderful human beings to do a major job at our townhouse: replacing the 30-year-old rooftop HVAC unit with a new, energy efficient one. Of course, before choosing them, we did our due diligence, secured four different bids and read all the reviews, etc.

Brody’s was certainly not the least expensive estimate we received. But they also weren’t the most expensive. (Those guys who have the fancy retro graphics on their trucks were the most expensive… and yet their rep did not offer us the better equipment options that Brody did, he was slow to follow up, and just didn’t seem to care about winning our business.) And on the flipside, there was a contractor whose bid came in much cheaper. But he suggested that getting a permit for a major crane operation over a public sidewalk on a shared-property condominium building should be considered optional – giant red flag.

In addition to having great reviews and a reasonable price, our interactions with Brody’s rep, Brian, were great. He was extremely knowledgeable, ridiculously responsive and just gave off good vibes. So we happily went with Brody Pennell and are so glad we did. They sent out their foreman, Jaime – another kind, courteous, professional man – to scout the job, got it scheduled quickly, even though it was around the Thanksgiving holiday, and showed up exactly when they said they would with every visit. The big installation itself went swimmingly. And again the Brody techs that did the bulk of the work were great representatives for the company.

Then, after the work was complete, a couple of problems revealed themselves. I won’t go into extreme detail on this. But due to the custom curb mounting that the new machine required, there was an increase in vibrations into the house, which was unexpected from a new, more efficient machine. And there was a roof leak issue that occurred during the unprecedented rains that we had last winter.

For both issues, Brody was on their game without us having to push them. They were simply committed to making things right for us from the beginning. The head of the company, Mike Carson, dealt with us directly, every step of the way. And the entire Brody team did everything in their power to get the issues fixed. This required several visits to the house, and sourcing subcontractors to deal with certain issues. To be clear, this wasn’t convenient for either us or them. And Brody likely ended up losing money on this job. But that never stopped them from doing what they needed to in order to make things right.

That is what separates a great contractor from a serviceable one. And that is why we will be customers of theirs for life and will always recommend Brody Pennell to anyone who needs HVAC work done.</text>

<Text>The tech was execllent.  He was very professional.  I had him come out for the LADWP AC optimization program. He did everything quickly, was very commnicative, and treated me with the respect.  The office at Brody Pennell was a bit challenging.  I think they forgot to put me on schedule causing the tech to be late.  He was supposed to come between 10-12 and he arrived at 12:05.  I had to call the office twice and they weren't truthful. Thankfully the technician's professionalism made up for the office.</Text><pictures>None</pictures><Response>{'time': 1547917666114, 'text': "Pam I am glad to hear you were happy with the our technician's services, however I am sad to hear about your struggles with our CSR's, that is generally not the norm.

Called for an estimate for some work needed by my company. Spoke with Brian and agreed on a time to come out, see the job and give me a quote. The day of Brian takes it upon himself to show up an hour early without calling or emailing all while i'm out to lunch. Then has the nerve to ask me to come back to the office via relay from my receptionist. I arrived back at the time we were scheduled to meet and gave him a call. He said he was in the area and decided to show up, then asked to reschedule our appointment. Total lack of professionalism. If you call them, while on hold there is a statement about first impressions blah blah, well Brody Pennell sure missed the mark on that. Also missed out a job upwards of $10,000.< /text>

< Review>
Professional and capable of completing a difficult project at my house. Sal went out of his way to to be polite and considerate to to my family.

I had an existing heating and ductwork system at my house, but wanted to add air conditioning. I needed a company that would get the work permitted with the city, crane the AC unit on my roof, build a platform and run Ref. Coils to my existing mechanical closet and make everything fit with existing heater.

I reached out to three companies - BP provided the most competitive price, best product and most problem solving/ solutions for installation.<//Review>

<Text>Hi,

I am the COO of Allstate HOA Management and Brody-Pennell overall has been great. They aren't the best deal in town but you get quality and professionalism with them as well as a responsive team.

I would highly recommend them and feel free to contact me should you have any questions.<//Text>< Rate>

< review>
I like to joke about getting "Excellent Customer Service"  but with BP, it is NO JOKE.

I first inter-acted with them through the LADWP AC OPTIMIZATION PROGRAM (thank you for the FREE "Nest" Thermostat.

Then, a few weeks later, the gas valves on my furnace gave out - after 35 years????? - and repairing it was out of the question!

Within days, BP was out to give me an estimate on a new HVAC system - again, 35 years old - and with LADPW/SOCAL GAS and Carrier rebates, the price was top-notch, even beating COSTCO!

The techs completed the job over two days in less than 14 hours.  They were friendly, cooperative, extremely neat and very knowledgeable.

I look forward to many years of (limited, hopefully) service (meaning, bi-yearly inspections) and great quality from my new equipment.< /review>

It's very hard to find a reliable service company. Over the past 20 years, I have tried dozens of vendors. Brody Pennell is by far one of the best. I would highly recommend there services as they are professional, responsive and friendly. I have dealt with them for about 6 years (they have installed / repaired dampers, evaporators, a/c systems and exhaust fans for me) and I have never had any issue with any aspect of their services. If you want expert care and courteous attention for your Heating or A/C needs, I don't know of any better company than Brody Pennell.< /Review>

<Text>Air conditioning unit died. It needed a new condenser hose. Cost would have been almost as much as a new unit and the unit was quite old. Brody-Pennell made a very reasonable bid for a new unit with labor, install and all. Within  3 days, a new unit was installed, tested and working before the next heat wave by two very polite, professional men. With my 94 year old mother-in-law living with us now, this is fantastic! Brody-Pennell, I can't thank you enough.< /Text>< pics>

I had a great experience today.
The company was communicative and delivered on its promise to me.
My heating system was not working when I woke up this morning and it is working now.
I look forward to working with Brody-Pennell in the future.</text>

Brody Pennell installed a blower motor in the primary air handler that supplies the operating room of my plastic surgery center on January 5th and did an outstanding job. York manufacturers sent a defective motor for Brody Pennell to install and it failed instantly. I contacted the President of Brody Pennell, Mike Carson, immediately, because our center had three large surgeries at risk for the next day. Mike and his crew of Tom and Carlos worked tirelessly until midnight and were successful in locating a generic motor and getting my center up and running again. Mike even called me the next morning at 6:05 to confirm that my blower motor was running. It was!!! Seldom do I find people with the integrity and depth of character that I saw personally in Mike, Tom,and Carlos. This HVAC company is led by a President who truly cares about his customers. If you need HVAC services that you can count on, call Brody Pennell.

Our experience with Brody-Penell has been very disappointing.  After purchasing a Carrier A/C unit one year ago, I have had to call them out twice.  Mistakes they have made cost me more money.  I was told by the owner that they are not a "non-profit company' when I asked why I had to pay a service charge for a mistake that their technician made.
I have cancelled my maintenance contract and will no longer work with this company who in my opinion isn't concerned with customer satisfaction.  When I told the owner I would post this review he said that was extortion.  No sir, that is an unsatisfied customer helping other potential customers make informed purchases.</review>

< Review>
**UPDATE:  was contacted about a week later by president mike carson regarding my air conditioning service.  he agreed with my review, but disputed the amount of time the worker was at my house (1.5 hours vs the actual ~20 minutes).  i understand that the worker can put whatever time he likes on his forms, maybe even include travel time even though their office is about 2 miles from my house. but i took time off from work that morning to let him in and out of my house and i did not miss 1.5 hours of work that day.  we agreed to disagree.

mr. carson offered a partial refund of ~$160 which brought the labor costs closer to other competitors, though he stated that he could not match khan air conditioning, probably because their overhead is lower due to being located in the valley.  so $440 compared to khan's $375 for a WARRANTY-COVERED REPAIR ...

i appreciate mr. carson's attempt to reach out to me.  i also appreciate the power of google plus to inform business owners and supervisors of ways to provide a level of service that is satisfactory to their customers.

however, i am disappointed that it required a truthful negative review on a review site to get a less unsatisfactory response.

**PREVIOUS REVIEW:  TLDR -- I regret choosing Brody Pennell to perform warranty service on my air conditioner.

in a house built brand new in 2014, the brand new carrier ac stopped blowing air ...  literally 1 year and 2 months -- just outside primary warranty coverage ... but still within the 5 year parts warranty ...

found brody pennell (among others) on the carrier website and every company i called wanted to charge ~$100 just to diagnose the issue ... none would apply the $100 to future work which means if you got a second or third opinion, you'd be out $100-$200 without any work being done ...

brody pennell was able to come out the quickest and diagnosed the faulty blower motor covered under warranty ... then quoted a MIND-BLOWING ~$600 for labor/incidentals ... i called to ask for some kind of consideration, but the operator suggested that he couldn't do anything unless i had a maintenance plan (~$200/yr) with them ...

so my dilemma was to take a chance with brody pennell since i was already in for a non-refundable ~$100 with the guess that other companies would charge the non-refundable $100 and also be in the same ballpark with labor charges ...

so the part was ordered and the repairman came and fixed the motor in LITERALLY 20 MINUTES -- 8am to 8:20am ... unscrew/unplug bad part, re-plug/re-screw good part, done ... $600 for 20 minutes of work on a warranty-covered part ...

brody pennell gave no consideration to the age of the unit (only a year old) or the amount of time to fix the motor (plug and play in 20 minutes) ...

horrible guess on my part ...

turns out 2 of my neighbors also have failed blower motors (apparently carrier ac units are horrible and will fail just outside of 1 year of moderate use) and they took a chance on other companies' labor charges ...

khan air conditioning charged my neighbor $375 for THE EXACT SAME WORK ...

please do yourself a favor and use khan air conditioning or ANYONE ELSE THAT CHARGES LESS THAN $600 FOR 20 MINUTES WORTH OF WORK ...

PS -- sent an e-mail to corporate carrier regarding the extremely high labor cost on a warranty-covered part ... the response:

"Each dealer is independently owned and operated and we do not control their business practices."<//Review>

As the name stated, the ocean in this region is quite restless, with a lot of waves rushing to shores.   The magnificent views is the symbol of this world famous ocean drive.    I wish I had come here more frequently when I lived in the Bay Area.<//Review>

It's a point in 17 Mile drive. I liked this place to watch Waves. As the name indicated, in this area, you can see super Waves. One of the main attraction in 17 Mile drive.<//text>

<review>This is a quick stop along 17 Mile Drive.  The waves seem to move in 4 directions, crashing and rolling over rocks just beneath the surface.  You can see Spanish Bay, Pebble Beach and Asilomar, Pacific Grove in the distance.< /review>< pictures>

<Name>Yvonne 10<//Name><review>(Translated by Google) The troubled sea is said to have gotten its name because it is said to be one of the brightest shorelines in Pebble Beach. Strong waves constantly collide and collide, probably caused by submerged rocks.
This place does not look much different than going to point 5 to point joe, there are more parking spaces than here.

Joe, there are more parking spaces than here.

(Original)
Das unruhige Meer soll seinen Namen bekommen haben, weil er einer der strahlendsten Küstenabschnitte in Pebble Beach sein soll. Starke Wellen laufen ständig zusammen und prallen aufeinander, wahrscheinlich verursacht durch untergetauchte Felsen.
Dieser Platz sieht nicht viel anders aus, als wenn man zu Punkt 5 zum Point Joe geht, da gibt es auch mehr Parkplätze als hier.

<Rating>5</Rating><Review>We live by Hogan and are stopping by a few times a month to let our dog swim. There are a few beaches in the very back of the mountain that are "day use areas" that we take her back and throw her water toy out for an hour or so. Very beautiful in the winter. Lots of plush green grass. But in the summer it all dies and doesn't look quite as beautiful. At the right time of year and spot though.....this place is definitely 5 stars.< /Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNFxHgGyf7OHOaTf8bdrEmfiURnhKx4ICk5N1QK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMKPaE6bFwsQQFm1CQGzQWFKeA9PdzK4PDs2916=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMMfYuBENK2n4S8yBQtBxRnpFzgblrNcv-W6dD_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNS6P3N3Li2ubTqOxeRL0HpsQYBscRoyhpAlJ2C=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures>< Resp>

I use the lake almost daily to exercise my dogs. First week of Jan. 2021 was at Wrinkle Cove boat ramp and found a camera. It is a Cannon Power Shot Elph 180. Checked SD card trying to find an ID. Looked like a out of town family on a cross country trip with most of the shots of two young girls. If it is yours I left contact info with park rangers and camp host at entrance.</review>

We spent the day here for our first time and had a good experience. We didn't go in all the way to the camp sites but we stopped at the first right turn which has parking spots about 100' away from the water that are blocked with huge rocks to prevent vehicle access. There are about 3 over heads with tables as well as bbq pits up near the road. The water is perfect temperature, not to cold and not to warm. Bring water shoes though, it is very rocky in the water as well as on land so don't forget your chairs. Also bring some kind of canopy for shade since there aren't any trees anywhere near the water. It wasn't to busy either where we were which was awesome.</review>

Nice like with great camping and day use.  Just drove around the place so can't comment on conditions for recreation but all the trails I hiked were in decent shape, muddy but my visit was in the winter.  Narrow roads around the park at times and some of the dirt roads in and out of parking areas had pot holes I was in a car and made it through no problem but drive slow when you see standing water/puddles.<//text>

When I first heard of New Hogan Lake all I could think about was the fishing, the being out in the nature and well for me it was kind of a belated celebration. Yes for me going somewhere where one haven't been before should be an adventure, wouldn't you think?  Anyway for this place for me was kindof a fantasy in some ways. Even though the fishing was great, the camping with friends and the enjoyment of sharing of ood over a camp fire with rhat open air of conversation with those campers next door to us. But the biggest thing that I came to notice wasn't just the nature or natural surroundings of all things was the mere fact of how  many couples that were there. As I scoped around and to my own amazement I sensed certain romance to this place. The rolling hills coming to this area. The presence of an eternal peace I felt from within. Further looking into the softness of the countryside and the soft flow of the sunset. It seemed magical in ways that I couldn't imagine in other places. Granted its my own opinion but you must experience taking part in visiting New Hogan Lake. A place to take the family, a good friend or perhaps that certain "Love" on a short stroll through that's making it's calling. So when and if you do go, share it, I think its well worth it.<//Review>

Fair to excellent at time though the year. Extra hot in summer months. Fishing is fair though out the year. Boat ramps are in good condition.
Update Oct. 8th boat ramp water level is low . Fishing is okay . Campgrounds are all open with few campers there.<//review>

There is a beautiful groomed jogging trail and picnic grounds, campgrounds, playgrounds, boat ramp and swimming, fishing, and watersports. Great place for any time of year.<//review>

<Text>I liked it except for the dead trees everywhere. Most of the bathrooms were very clean. The workers do clean up most of the firepits. The reservations tags are left on and out dated. The showers do not have a good mixture of hot and cold. They are scalding hot!!! I don't think the cold water is even turned on. The rangers are unresponsive to issues that are requested. Like scalding hot water! The showers are free though. Good for washing dishes and clothing in.<//Text>< pics>

I've been here a few times to go boating with my family. Gorgeous area and generally really friendly people around. The camping is basic and you don't need a ton as there is a grill and bathrooms nearby. If you're looking for really outdoorsy then this may not be the best place for you. However, if you're looking to get away for the weekend this is a great spot. Good for kids as well.</review>

We booked sites 77 and 78 at the Acorn Campground for our family camping trip.
The lake is beautiful and the grounds are nice  but OMG THE WASPS WERE RELENTLESS AND EVERYWHERE!!!  We couldn't even eat or drink anything because the moment you open food or drink, here they come and you literally cannot get away from them.  My son and my grand daughters ate dinner in the car, while my daughter-in-law and myself just opted not to eat after finding out that there was no where to go to get away from the wasps.  We anxiously awaited the coming of evening so that the wasps would go away,  only to find out that after the wasps went in, the frogs came out in numbers.  They literally ran in packs, and though no one was really afraid of them, it is unnerving to have 5 to 10 jump out of nowhere with each and every step, and to find 20 to 30 surrounding each tree, bush, water faucet, etc.

Don't misunderstand.  We camp every year as a family, and are not looking to be bug and critter free.  The conditions at New Hogan Lake, however, were quite extreme.  The lady who manages the campsites told us that we have to remember that the wasps and frogs are in their home.  Though this is very true, it is up to those who manage the campsites to inform patrons of the presence of the wasps and frogs before a person makes their reservation so that decisions can be made with everything in mind.  We had a person with a bee allergy (though minor) as part of our group.  One sting, though an issue, is not life threatening, but there existed the possibility of multiple stings which would have been detrimental because the wasps were just that brutal.  We visited the campground in March before booking it and spoke with the host about the sites.  Had we, at that time, been informed of the possibility that the wasps would be rampaging like this as this is their home, we would have looked for other sites within the campground where the wasps weren't so prevalent, or opted for another campground all together.  And for her to say that we may or may not get a refund because we didn't want to stay there makes me NOT A FAN OF NEW HOGAN LAKE!!!!</Text>

Yeah this Lake as a fairly good fishing lake it's got stripers black bass crappie perch carp catfish and on the right dash pretty good fishing the campsites are very nice there fairly close to the water it's not like Melones where you're so far from the water at their campsites the only thing I didn't like is there fish cleaning station has no power so if you have an electric play Knife it doesn't do you any good< /Text>

love the spot as soon as you go in you feel the good vibes they have good cuts and really good prices. This place is very family friendly they have toys, candy machines, lil rides for kids and the decorations are something to see very clean ATM inside and bathrooms are clean. The place brings back what a barber shop should be not just a cut but an experience.</Review>

All they u use is clippers, and hardly ever use scissors. You tell them to do something and they do another. Don't get me wrong, at the end the cut is decent, but its not what you asked for. Your kindness makes up for your shortages. Frankly, I am thinking about going to another shop! Might pay more, but at least I will be satisfied with my purchase!!! 3 stars cuz i've been going there for a while... I came back to edit as I was trying to understand the positive reviews, and came to the conclusion that a lot of the low rating comments share similarities to mine... I think Mexicans confuse politeness for a good job!

<text>The people are nice and it does have a friendly environment, but for $15 and to possibly have spots, a pushed backed lining, noticeable fade lines (looks like the fade goes from 0-3: bowl on top of the head style), then go here. I only give it a two because theworkers are politr and it is professional where I can take my children and not hear inappropriate language or conversations.<//text>< pics>

I try this Barber shop for a couple months.

This place is not good for fancy haircuts (line ups will look a bit off)

Sometimes I'll have to tell them that they miss a spot, this last time I didn't check. Later that day I found couple spots not done well.

Not going back to this barber shop<//Text>

In addition, we were having a problem with our air conditioning coming on by itself when in OFF position.  First off, I was very, very pleased with the professionalism and friendliness of the office staff.  I was given first rate service.  The appointment was scheduled for two days later, with a three hour window period, which is common and expected.  The service tech arrived with a mask and immediately introduced himself.  He explained what he would be doing to the unit.  Within fifteen minutes, the tech was done and told us he was done and showed some wires that were lose that he replaced.  Again, he was very friendly and professional.  We are very happy with Grants and will definitely be a returning customer.< /Text><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

<Text>I highly recommend this place every other place I called could not get me in on the same day. My ac had went out and the temp for the day was 106 I needed it fixed fast. And Grant's Air conditioning was there to save the day. The guy who came out was Danny and he was amazing found what was wrong within minutes and it was fixed within 30 minutes 😀 and the cost was unbelievably reasonable.  Once again highly highly highly recommend 👌</Text>< rating>

<Review>Another HVAC company quoted us nearly $700 to replace the main chip in our unit when our heater wasn't kicking on. I called Grant's to get a second opinion and within an hour and for around $200, we were up and running. All we needed was a new capacitor. Adrian took care of business, was super informative and professional. Thank you. You've earned my continued business.</Review>< pictures>

< Review>
Grant’s has installed two air/heater conditioners/units over the past 25 years.  We purchased the maintenance agreements so we have always had great professional service and perfect running units.  The service guys come out twice a year and goes through the unit and changes the filter.  It is a win/win.  Great company.<//Review>

Been with Grant’s for 25+ years and very happy with service. Wendy in the front office is great at getting appointments set up and the service guys are always on time and fill me in on the status of my unit. I had installed a new thermostat and on the last service they double checked my wiring connect. Great job.< /text>

We called Grants they were out that day and worked to fix the problem quickly. Now we are Grants customers for both of our homes!  Everyone at Grants is friendly and exceptional customer service all around!!!!</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><GmapID>0x80952f7ea6cf6c01:0xb1e84db3cd4387b1<//GmapID></record>

Our A/C decided to go out when it was 107 out and Grants was so quick to help. They sent Adrian out and we were so lucky! He was awesome and didn't just assume what was wrong, he figured it out and I was so very thankful for that. It's not just Adrian but the office staff as well, they rock at getting someone out and were so personable to work with. Thank you Grants!< /text>

<Review>My furnace stopped working properly so I asked my friends for a recommendation. Grant's was the business they advised I call. They were able to get a tech out to me the very next day. He was very friendly and knowledgeable. I asked him a lot of questions about the furnace and he took the time to explain it. He even gave me some care and maintenance tips.

The service was prompt, the tech pleasant, and overall I was highly satisfied with the interaction. I will utilize their services in the future and recommend them to others.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

Grants installed an Aprilaire system which reduces dust, pollen ect in your house by adding a hepa filter and polarizing plate to the inflow duct. They work great. I called several other HVAC companies but Grants was the only co. Who knew what Aprilaire was and how to do the install. They were professional, on time and quickly did the job plus they made extra boxes to fit the Aprilaire. They also fixed some of the shoddy duct work done by the builders for free. The only thing is they forgot the thermostat which they will bring with them when they clean the ducts next week. Overall great job. Thanks</Text>

I had my 20 year old HVAC together with the air ducts replaced and the Grant's Air Conditioning & Heating team, from the owner, desk people to the crew on the ground, has been very professional and great.  They made sure my electrical work is up to the current code, they even cleared up the old blocked water drainage system.  They offered me to do the final inspection as well as to see how well the airflow from each air vent was and everything has been over my expectation.  They are the heroes during the heat and Covid-19 pandemic.  Thanks so much!<//review>

From Wendy in the office, to Donovan who helped talk through our issue and recommended Jim to inspect our heating unit... they were all amazing.
This was our second experience in a couple of years with Grant's and will seek them out again if needed.

Jim inspected as a 2nd opinion for us. Another company had come out sent by our home warranty company. We'd been told NOT to use our heating system. We were then quoted for a whole new system and most of the cost we would have to pay.

Jim took time to talk to us, explain his findings from the inspection and said while the system was original (1980s) that it was still fully functional. Wow!!! Heat is on and we are comfortable again. Thank you Jim for your time, expertise and assessment. When we really need work done.... we'll give you a call.<//Text>

First the guy showed up super early with no forewarning. Then, I was never contacted by anyone about the part that was needed to fix my AC. I always had to call. I was told on Thursday when the guy came out I’d receive an update the next day. I finally had to call the following Monday afternoon. I was told the part would be in Tuesday and I would receive a callback shortly with details. No call came. I called back Tuesday and after several back and forth calls was informed the part hadn’t even been ordered!! He finally came Thursday and was able to fix it. It took a full week in 100* temps because nobody bothered to check on the order.
At least it works now I guess<//review>

Our fan and motor went out on a Wed night.  Grant's came and checked it out on Thur and needed to order the parts; Fri morning they were there early and replaced the damage parts.  We really appreciate the prompt service during these hot days of early Sept.  Pepe and Adrian were both really helpful and should be commended.< /text>

< Review>
Had our AC condenser go out on Sunday night of Labor Day weekend.
Called on Monday morning, Jim from Grant's was at our house within 45 minutes. Was told it maybe 2 hours. Love it when Company exceeds expectations. 👍<//Review>

<text>We have a 100year old house with a odd heating and AC set up. We weren’t exactly sure how to heat our house the best and most affordable way this winter. They came over and helped us figure out our best option that was also affordable. They didn’t try to up sale us on a new system or make me purchase or fix things un needed.  I (a women) have had to handle most of our service men and unfortunately have been taken advantage of or talked down to. This way not the case with Grants.  We enjoyed working with them and appreciated their honestly and help.<//text><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

It started with the phone call.... the ladies listened and went out of there way to make me feel like someone cared and help is on its way.... super friendly and knowledgeable... then it transferred into the actual repair man.. JIM ,WOW he arrived went right to work , found problem and fixed a situation that was almost impossible. The company actually fought to save me money on all levels.. this took some above and beyond service by JIM and the whole team.. i would highly recommend Grants for all your needs .... job well done ... whole team!!!!!!< /Review>< Gmap_id>

You cannot get a better company to service your home or businesses HVAC sytems. I have been using Grants AC for many years and won't go anywhere else. From the receptionists, technicians and owner you get only top notch treatment! Take it from me you won't be disappointed in their service. A huge THANK YOU to your entire staff for keeping my family Grant's cool!~)<//review>

Grant's was able to provide next day AC service, to two homes for me, at the end of June which is obviously busy season for the HVAC companies. Tech was professional and very considerate of our time (showed up exactly on time).</Review>

Have bought our new HVAC and Evaporators Cooler from Grant’s during their winter discount period and been able to make payments over 90 days which really helps. And they coordinate Spring and Fall service dates so we don’t have to remember to do it.< /review>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Review>I've been using AAA for years now, and the rare times I need to use their DMV services completely justify me continuing to be a member. I was trying to transfer my vehicle to a new owner and I went back and forth with the DMV for, no joke, 9 months. Every time they lost something or forgot to mention I need some paper work... Needless to say, I was annoyed. Then I found out that AAA members can do vehicle transfers at AAA branches (Not sure why I didn't think of that before...). I went in, and within 20 minutes, they helped me complete my vehicle transfer. It took the DMV over 9 months to do what AAA took less than 20 minutes to do. Not only that, but the people who helped me we very friendly and knew what they were doing.

I haven't had a single bad experience with this location, or AAA in general, yet.</Review>< Pics>

<Date>1578195890509< /Date><Text>walked in on a weekday around the holidays this year to get a new membership. I had been a AAA member for many years as a gift from my family and used the towing services on several occasions. This time I got my own membership for my growing family. The staff was really helpful going over the benefit differences. There were some new benefits I was unaware of that made the premium membership a no-brainer. 200mi of towing has been really helpful in the past, the battery service as well. I now have an EV so the ability to tow a potentially dead car on a road trip to a charging station is a helpful option to have in a pinch. The unexpected perks: emergency medical transport up to $25k, travel insurance up to $300k, and motorcycle towing service was worth it for me since motorbike towing can be expensive. This branch has been helpful in the past with DMV tasks too. It's nice to have one local and accessible and the staff has always been friendly.</Text><userid>105120232722889809490<//userid><name>Adam Foye<//name><Response>{'time': 1579198124667, 'text': 'Thanks for the feedback, Adam!

<time>1500652965082<//time><rating>1</rating><Review>If I could give it zero I would. I got better service AT the DMV. Waiting in line at 4pm Wed July 20  2017. A rep is helping one gentleman at the counter and is very engaged. That's the good part. The rep then must have gotten a text on his phone as he TAKES HIS PHONE OUT and texts back, WHILE at the counter. While this does not impact me.. it is horrible customer service.
In the meantime, I wait and there are literally 5 other people wandering around.Not one acknowledges me nor comes over to help.After about 5 min another rep who was helping someone else comes to help me.There are now 4 other people wandering around, one less than 10 feet from me who never even said anything.
I am trying to pay my car reg. I write a check after giving them my ID and AAA card  and the rep then asks the other FOUR people ,oh can we take a check w/o the address on it?
Suddenly they all say NO.
I have been with them for 40 years. 40. I had a new check book. I gave them my ID  and suddenly EVERYONE has an opinion ?
Honestly, I was at the DMV a week ago and I truly got better service.</Review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

Thank you AAA Smith Ranch Road!   I had a complicated situation with a purchase of a car from some one who had passed away...a long trail of pink slips etc.... The guy who helped me was so helpful. Took lots of time helping me with what I had to do to get my car correctly registered.  No line, no waiting, just great service.</review>

The member services like DMV renewals and theme park tickets is very inefficient.  No cross training done and only 1 person can do certain things.  Very disappointed in paying for “membership” with 45 minutes in line with no end in sight.  Disappointed and will be canceling membership...< /Text>

<Review>Woman I worked with was very nice and helpful. However the man that was also working the DMV desk (didn't get his name, but he was balding) was unnecessarily rude. Very verbally abrasive, seems like he hates his job, but nonetheless doesn't need to take it out on the customers. The woman I was working with asked him a question for clarification with what she was working with me on and he only had rude responses to offer, not helpful. I feel sorry for all those who are unfortunate enough to come into contact with him.< /Review>< userid>

Edited  -  Was a rant, but cathartic.   Bottom line, expect mistakes from the staff to cause you to have to fill out additional forms that require both seller and buyer to sign if you are registering a vehicle you have recently purchased and are there to transfer title.
Shorter lines then the DMV, but lower level of command and competence of the required skills to help the customers.</text>

My experience with this office will mortify you if you are AFRICAN AMERICAN please do not use this AAA branch for anything ! . I walk into this branch shortly after getting off from work I was pulled over by SAN ANSELMO PD after leaving my job parking lot only to find out that someone had stolen my 2019 sticker off of my vehicle luckily the officer and myself knew on another from me working at the San Anselmo post office I’m familiar with police department, he told me to go to AAA on 99 smith road and pay 22.00$ to get a replacement sticker , I arrive at this office no sooner then me walking in every agent in the office just stared at me like they seen a ghost I stood in line waited my turn for the dmv services and was told by the woman who works in the middle station that she could not help me with the sale of a 2019 sticker unless I pay my registration in full in order for her to issue me a 2019 sticker until the following two weeks I couldn’t believe it I was distraught I just watched a Caucasian man do the exact Same thing in front of me and I was denied services because of my race ??? I left the office and began my journey to the Pinole branch to see if they would assist me with my DMV services upon arriving I spoke with a manager and he to assured me that she should’ve issued me a 2019 sticker without hesitation . I am fully aware that Marin county is predominantly Caucasian and there is a very high level of discrimination and prejudice against African American people out here which is why I am writing this review to make other African American people aware this behavior is unexceptionable and disgraceful you pay yearly for a memebership to receive an experience like I have . My feelings are hurt we as African American people still face racial profiling, discrimination for the color of our skin after slavery ? When we it ever end . Her manager called me and told me she would pay for my memebership for next year but that’s all she could do for me , the level of Caring for memebers doesn’t exist at this office at all . a free memebership doesn’t justify her action towards me at all she was a Caucasian women. Who didn’t like black people and it showed this day .< /text>

The people working at the DMV counter were pretty unfriendly the last two times I went. They aren't attentive and had me repeat myself. Dismissive and flippant attitude. The DMV counter saved me time off work but next time I'll do everything online.<//text>

Okay so i have been a member of AAA since forever but going to this location should be a pleasure experience but instead EDGAR LAGAVERDE is sooo ego-ish thinking that he works here and knows it all when infact i kinda know already what needs to be done but instead to solve it right there,right then he asked me to step aside so he can chit chat with his co-worker.
Like really after a looooong line all you do is chit chat with ur co-worker instead of helping a customer.

Very very unprofessional!!!!<//Text>

AAA has been so great in the past!  My last 2 visits for DMV services have been a complete waste and disappointment.  Both of these visits have been waiting in line for more than an hour.  The first visit a representative  fully reviewed my paperwork as i entered the line and said oh its no problem we can transfer this car.  After waiting 1 hour they looked at my paperwork for 25 seconds and said we cant transfer this you need to take this to the DMV. The second visit, Paper work was started and PAID for with AAA to transfer an out of state car to CA. We needed to get a smog and few other things and told to return and they can give us the CA plates.  After waiting 1 hour in line the employee was aggressively quick and telling us they cant complete this.  We need to visit the DMV!   I clearly remember them telling us they can give us the plates!  Just frustrating experiences.<//text>

The time saved NOT waiting in a DMV line in Novato or Corte Madera is worth the price of membership all by itself.  I went to Novato DMV and it would've been 35 minutes before I would even get a ticket number to see someone... So that would've been an hour minimum.  How much is an hour of your life worth?
Become a AAA member, get roadside assistance, discounts everywhere and restore your sanity by receiving better than DMV - DMV services in a cool, inviting place.  No brainier.<//review>

Update:

The staff at the DMV services counter have made many improvements, including the triage of long lines to best route patrons and customer service focused one on one communication. I have been visiting since the last review and these incremental changes have made the experience much better. Re-reading it; my last review is somewhat poor as it is simple anecdote; and with the "star" system that one experience with two staff unfairly disparaged their whole team.

Old Review:

The staff at DMV services told me they were unable to print out a copy of my registration information for a vehicle that I own. I thought that was a service that they were able to provide. When I went home I checked online and found on the AAA website that in fact that is a service they are able to provide. When I called to let them know they simply agreed and do not apologize for wasting my time. The woman at the counter was unnecessarily rude and gave me incorrect information. If you visit this branch be prepared to be very patient with staff  they will likely be rude and not understand what services they are able to provide.<//Review>

<text>They never answer their  landline phone and don't return the voicemail offered to leave a message.  It's very sad that a business does not answer their phone to it's customers and prospective customers alike.

What's even worse is to offer us to leave a message stating a AAA representative will call us back..Ive been trying for about a month and half and left 3 messages.

Very very poor...</text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

Do not trust their advice on out of state requirements for tag renewals. Their bad advice cost me $285.  I was moving from California to Florida and my car tag was up for renewal.  I visited this office and asked would I need to renew my tag since I am moving to Florida and will switch to a Fla license and tag for my car.  The agent insisted I would need to have a current tag before Florida would issue a new tag.  WRONG.  That bad advice cost me $280 I did not need to spend.  The state of Florida DMV does not care if you out of state tag has a current sticker on it.< /Review>

<Rating>1< /Rating><Text>Several years ago I decided I want d a new car insurance and liked the idea of AAA having there own DMV at there offices as well as the famous road side service. How ever in recent Months there have been some very different attatudes around the company store. First of all the only reason my mother switch her insurance to AAA WAS BECOUSE THAT IS WHAT I WANT and she just felt the family should have the same kind insurence for billing. After three years they no longer seem interested in our business anymore. Not only was the insurence agent (floor sales person) rude to my mother who is in her 70's they actually ganged up on her to intimidate her and make her feel in fear of switch insurence. Witch is about the sleaziest thing I have ever heard. When I came in to discourse the service they gave her. They actually asked me person questions like why don't I have my own credit cards, when am I buying another car, why don't you pay cash for everything now like I was somehow not worthy of the service they gave me. Angelo himself condescendingly asked me personal questions about the accident I got in where I almost killed someone as if I was a shity person or something. This is the way an insurence company treats their costumer. Further more when my mother asked for a manifest she was brow betten by the maniger and intimidated into not changing her policy. I almost think what they did might be illegal. Using fear on a poor old lady to make her pay more money for longer times.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

<Review>I just got a haircut today in the morning and i ended up coming back out with a freshass clean fade. There's also no need for appointments as they allow walk-ins, they also have really pretty looking female barbers. I will be coming back here for sure.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

< Review>
Hands down the best barber around. I work out of town a lot and have been around the block. These people are the best. Don't be afraid to let a woman cut your hair here. Unlike the rest of the barbers in town, everyone here is great. A woman did my hair and it was one of the best fades I've ever had. My buddy got his done too. Looked amazing.<//Review>

<review>Large barber shop, many chairs, clean, 2 male & 1 female barbers cutting hair when I visited.  Well lighted & friendly atmosphere.  Music plays in background.
Very long thick cushion waiting bench runs length of shop providing privacy & comfort if you have to wait.
I was seated as soon as I came in the door.  Barber was friendly and cut my hair as I asked.  I felt comfortable and welcomed, and was thanked for my business.
Shop is easy to access with giant shared parking lot.  Price was reasonable & I will go back.< /review></record></dataset><record>

I visited Johnny's barbershop on1/14/19
Pas or Pac cut my hair
It had been 6 months or so since my previous hair cut. I told him about my last few haircuts and what I didnt like about them and he was set on giving me the best experience possible. He made me feel comfortable and talked quite a bit for his first haircut of the day. I'm extremely satisfied with the haircut I received from him he did everything I asked! So I decided to give him a sizable tip. I will definitely go back to visit him and get another haircut absolutely amazing job!< /Review>

I have been getting my hair cut here for around 6 months, and have had it cut by 3 different barbers (because of availability). Each time I come here I leave happy and extremely satisfied with both the hair cut, and beard trim! Everyone here does excellent work, and are skilled barbers. I refuse to cut my hair anywhere else!!< /text>

Always slow on weekdays mid day and the owner that cuts hair is really good and fast. He's got 3 TV's, sometimes music on TV. I only wish he accepted credit cards, cash only. $12 a cut.</review>

<Review>My sista and I were enjoying her visit with us. She and I were driving out to the old home-site where we lived during a portion of our teenage years. A cute memory of our daddy prompted our going through this establishment's drive-thru. Our daddy would pull into the drive-thru and order 20 TACK-O's! Our daddy had his special pronounciation of those tasty tacos!<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

I am not fond of the egg rolls sereved in these chinese places so i go to Jack in the Box on the way home and pick up some of the best egg rolls. I even have egg rolls instead of fries. Anyway, the best thing i like to order at Jacks is the Country breakfast sandwich.< /Text>< pictures>

< Review>
Multiple times it has taken over 30 mins to get  my food. They were taking the order from one car and having them pull up and give them their food before ever taking the order of the next person in line. Many people give up and drive to another local Jack in the Box, and I did this one time and was able to drive there, get my food and drive home faster then this Jack in the box could serve me the same food. They are also not running 24 hrs. The times vary but early in the morning usually after 2am they will not take your order. They should be putting a something out to block the drive through so that you know they are closed.<//Review>

I just have to say I went to Jack n the box a few weeks ago late at night and had the best experience I've ever had in a drive through. The cashier's name is Earth she was awesome very polite got my order right when repeating it to me . When I got to the window she was very pleasant had a smile. Asked me if I needed any condiments I said no and she said are you sure no taco sauce or sauce for your chicken strips and omg yes I did my son told me mom don't forget ranch and I am always saying oh I should have gotten taco sauce because I like extra on my Taco's so as she haded me my bags and told me enjoy my food and have a great night I asked her name because I had to let it be known how awesome she is. Thank you Earth my food was good my son was happy and you were really awesome.< /Text>

Got chicken strip combo with curly fries (upcharge) and made combo large(drink and fries).  Cost was still low around $11 if memory serves me.  The food was cooked to order, so it was fresh-nice and hot.  Service was quick, approx two minute wait (drive through).  Cashier was polite and attentive and made sure I had all my condiments.<//Text>

Today my child & I ordered 2 combos and we waited for our number to be called there was 3 numbers call before our number 3 numbers called after our number. My daughter complaining she is starving. I go up to counter and my order was given to somebody else. A man before my number got his food and spilled his fries on the floor. So I guess he turned and went back to counter and the worker that hands out food had our order in his hand and handed it to the fry guy. So the said they will remake our food one worker opened the door and see the family with our food she told her co workers they had our food so meanwhile im dealing with my starving kid while they were eating our food. Thats messed up i think thats not first time that happened</Text>

This Jack in the Box always screws up my orders. I ask for my items and the always forget to put something in.. you think I have the time and gas to go back and complain. It’s a ripoff what they do.. and they don’t want to credit back your money or sometimes they don’t want even to give you what they forgot in your order.. very rude. Reporting to better business Bureaus< /Review>

You get exactly what you expect, their quality is always what you expect from Jack in the Box. I've been enjoying their late night menu, it's literally like they went to a frat house, waited until everyone was drunk and asked them what they wanted to eat but man they're good! Lol.<//Review>

Customer service needs to improve and be more friendly ! I remember going to Jack in the box as a child , teenager . The service was great and staff wore friendly and courteous in the San Fernando Valley and other cities . Palmdale Store Staff no matter what time of the day you go , the service is horrible .The Burgers are smashed and don't look nothing to compare to what the menu shows ! The fajita pitas  bread is stale . I love Jacks food . But the way this location preps it and serves it . Is a disgrace to the Jack in the box corporation !</review>< Pics>

<review>Ehhk!! Went to check out the 2.99 breakfast platter they were advertising and let me tell ya, you get what you pay for. That nasty saussage had a hair on it and when I peeled it off for a closer inspection it looked like a bloody scab came off with it, eggs were wet, and I don't even think its fair to call that flat thing bacon.

<review>Went through  drive thru 2 nights ago ordered over $50 worth of food. Out of courtesy I offered to park myself , so they had time to attend other customers. My food order was accurate no complaints there. But the customer service was horrible. Even my 10 year old daughter asked me , whats wrong with her mommy? Such a dry demeanor, no character, no smile, she looked like someone in charge for her shirt was different. I work to I understand bad days , but i also understand without customers we wouldnt have the job we have. So someone should  explain or retrain ethics of customer service , the last thing i wanted to see or encounter was her poor attitude.</review>< Rating>

This location made my order wrong multiple times within a few week time period; drive thru and walk in

I would get home....and the order isn't what I wanted...thanks :/

Go somewhere else unless you wanna deal with the risk or an incorrect order; then have to deal with getting the correct one

Food is fresh, no issues there. Simply just waste of time in my view<//review>

Be very careful of this place when you pay cash because cashiers Jose and Jasmin will give you back change but cut you off a dollar or two. Only to pull it out of the drawer at the end of the shift.</review>

<Text>HOW DO YOU MESS MY ORDER UP 4 TIMES IN ONE MONTH...

I WALKED IN AND WENT THROUGH THE DRIVE THRU 🤣🤣🤣 I have to drive, then drive back to this place again because something you guys messed up.... Really.... You should be fu**ing shut down honestly! Seems like they all have a bs attitude likes it's my fault you work there. Yes there's a handful of people who are cool and actually will go out there way to make sure your okay. They need to shut down and no relocate.... I hope Teriyaki place across gets more business than them even though there soda machine don't work yet they still offer you a cup 🤔🤔🤔<//Text>< Gmap_id>

Ordered a late night munchie meal with the nacho chicken sandwich, cherry powerade, and a Jr bacon cheeseburger. Was charged for everything, I got home with my food and noticed the Jr bacon burger was not inside and the chicken was very stale, I called the number here on google and no one picked up. I called around 10 times. It’s too late to go back but I thought if I leave those review they might believe me when I go tmrw. UNACCEPTABLE< /Text>

<Text>The service was fast and great. Very crowded place, the teller didn't know about hella-Pena burger. Instead suggested Sriracha burger. The burger was tangy, excessively because the burger was loaded with pickles. To add the restroom was in bad shape. Only one door was available to enter the restaurant.< /Text><Resp>None</Resp><rate>3</rate><user_id>108828771695911237097</user_id></record></dataset><record>

Every time you come to this Jack in the Box in the early morning like 4am, the Drive thru service either say the system is down, its rebooting, or not available. I even seen the drive-thru roped off with yellow tape to prevent early morning service which says open 24 hrs. I even have the saying on video. It happens every time. I've seen others turned away as well. Not good JIB 564 E. Palmdale Blvd, CA< /review>

I love jack in the box, but DON"T COME TO THIS LOCATION!! I went in thru drive thru and the lady got my order down and even asked me if everything on the screen was correct and I looked at it for about a minute and said yes. We pull up to the window and this lady gives us 2 drinks instead of 3 of them. Before we left the drive thru window we had specifically told her that we ordered 3 drinks and that my boyfriend had asked for the combo (meal). This lady has the nerve to tell me that she didn't get it down and she will be charging us for something that WE HAD ALREADY ASKED for and told her SEVERAL times if she got everything including drinks! Not only that, but this lady does not have very good hearing. She heard everything I said through the intercom when I was ordering everything but when it came to order my brother's she didn't put down that he didm't want onions or tomatoes. I told her about TWICE, before she even put it down and she even REPEATED IT right back to me the first time! At that point I just got fed up with this lady and I LEFT WITHOUT my drink!! I will be talking to the manager about this real soon. This happened not to long ago at around 11:05-11:10 pm on February 19, 2017 on Sunday night.</review>

I love Jack In The Box.. all items.. Try ordering chicken sandwich plain (no mayo), then get chicken nugget sauce on the side, bbq or terriaki or sweet and sour, etc. It's awesome.. it's like having a BBQ chicken or terriaki,  etc chicken sandwich. . Yummy!  or try this by ordering big cheese burger plain (no mayo or catsup) and instead ask for bbq or other chicken nugget sauce on the side.. Wow!  So glad they brought back the monster taco!!!!</Text><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

(Translated by Google) Terrible attention that I touch today, the very distracted boy does not listen to what one says and looks annoyed if one makes a mistake in size and then rectifies 🤦‍♀️
Appalling!!! It doesn't have his name on the shirt so I don't know his name.

(Original)
Pésima atención que me toco hoy, el muchacho muy distraído no escucha lo que uno le dice y se ve molesto si uno se equivoca en size y luego rectifica 🤦‍♀️
Pesimo!!! No tiene su nombre en la playera así q no se su nombre.</text>
