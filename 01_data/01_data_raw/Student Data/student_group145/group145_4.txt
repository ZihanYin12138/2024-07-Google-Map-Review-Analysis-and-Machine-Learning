<text>In the beginning they were very supportive and helpful in the middle not as supportive they were asking for all pictures and reports again at the end of almost 2 years 9 months latter collections called me that my towing bill wasn’t paid at all.  Towing company stated they  made a settlement offer a year into the case with Maria Prado after that agreement they made many attempts to contact her for the money no response back at all. I will never forget the call I received on October 29,2020 saying I owed $2665.00 in storage fees and I’m in collections. Please what ever they tell you verbally get it on paper don’t get comfortable thinking they have you covered that was my mistake believing they paid it in the beginning like they stated and I asked again before signing my documents and they said yes it was paid. To all the people I referred to this law group please be cautious get everything said verbally on paper to protect yourself especially from your own attorney so sad to say our own attorney.</text>< Pictures>

<Text>I have nothing but positive things to say about this firm! They did an amazing job on my auto accident case. I originally called the insurance thinking they would help but they just dragged their feet and after a few weeks put me at fault.  I was hurt and needed a doctor and had to get help and that's when I found B&D Law.  When I initially spoke with Ryan, she told me that they would hold my hand throughout the entire process. They didn't disappoint. They found me a bodyshop and got my car fixed and even paid my $500 deductible while fighting with the insurance.  They helped me with the right doctors and when I was better they not only got everything paid, but got me a big settlement $$$  in my pocket.  I would highly recommend you call them before every calling the insurance or anyone.  A big thank you to the entire team that helped me out, you are the best!</Text><resp>{'time': 1594680933189, 'text': 'Thanks for trusting us with your auto accident claim, Mike!

From the very first day of meeting with individuals from B&D Law Group I felt that I was in good hands. Each person i interacted with was always very polite and professional. My questions and concerns were always addressed in a timely manner. My case moved forward and I had a wonderful outcome. Thanks again to the entire B&D Law Group.</review>

One of the worse law firm, fake people. Had a fake google number you cannot reach them directly. These people specifically SO CALLED MARIA. will force you to not talk with any one else and she will win for you, which is not true what she will do she will messup your case, for three months and then make a silly excuse and deny the case after 3 months saying she found out this is not a case for her department. Very fake people.< /review>

When I first called B & D I was impressed with Ryan who walked me through the entire process.  She helped me get a rental car (at no cost to me), I got three different doctors that diagnosed me and treated me for over a year,  I did not pay anything out of pocket until then settled me case.  Then after they negotiated a better offer than I even thought I would get they negotiated my medical bills down to almost nothing.  They are the best!< /review>

I cannot say enough good things about B&D Law Group!!!  They took my case at literally the last minute before my statute of limitations date to file a claim.  I had hired a very inexperienced attorney and was in a panic as time was running out to file.   I was so grateful to find a firm that would take it.  They took my case even though they did not have an office close to me.  The Communication has been incredible all the way through the process.   They communicated with me regularly and gave me all kinds of information and a good education as to how the process works so I was never in the dark.   I can never thank them enough.   The entire team was incredible and they reduced my huge scary medical bills down!, which is a miracle in itself, so that I can actually recover.   a million thanks to B&D Law!! Because of them I have a brand new lease on life.       🤗</Review>

BEWARE OF THESE SO-CALLED “LAWYER GROUP”!!! They will never return calls. Only respond to you by text message. I went thru 2-3 attorneys, which were no help & only gave me empty promises of getting what I deserve for my case. Lied about the fact that we went to litigation & only had a deposition & mediation. Made my case go longer so that they can collect more. Wouldn’t even talk about the breakdown of my payments invoice. Just kept rushing me on signing contract just so that they wouldn’t have to go to court.  Would really love to get a class action suit on this place. I think I’ll look into it, so they can not do this injustice to others.< /review>

I would definitely recommend Babak and Chantly to come to talk to them and they will take care of you, you can trust them.

I had a personal injury case with B&D. Their office was communicative, timely and professional. They helped me every step along the way and made sure to fight for my case. The staff is very friendly and always available. I highly recommend going with B&D. Their many years experience dealing with complex cases reassured me into making one of the best decisions and having the best outcome. Thank you!</Review>

I am so thankful I made this phone call. This was the first accident I have ever been involved with. I not only did I get a live person instantly on the phone, but we went over details immediately and moved forward quickly from there. I feel very thankful to have had them representing me through this. It was a lengthy process, but I was over the moon happy with my settlement. HIGHLY recommend their amazing team!!

Go somewhere else,  attorney will call you everyday trying to get you to sign with their law firm for your case once you do the attorney turns into a ghost,  almost impossible to get a hold of afterwards,  and your case will no matter what go past 6 months so expect to pay them 50 percent of your settlement.</review>

B&D LAW GROUP!!
Warning stay away from these sneaky liars ,they are in the business for them self NOT YOU!
I was involved in a motorcycle accident in February 2015 It was an easy case the man ran me over  I was pinned underneath his van my leg was trapped.
MR smooth Attorney (salesman) MICHAEL GEOOLA was my person of contact
He told me it was a easy simple case I would have money in 3 months HA HA
We Negotiated contract to 28% MICHAEL gave me a really hard time and acted like he was doing me a HUGE favor KEEP READING @
Over one year goes by and my totaled  motorcycle is still setting in my driveway.
Finally a year 1/2 later
I get paid for my totaled motorcycle
Finally 8/2019
I'm getting a check for my pain and suffering
But I'm paying them 40%
Because I did not read the contract I trusted them they are supposed to be on my side
Dam it I'm an idiot!
Please learn from my horrible experience and stay far far away from these crooks< /Text>

I was involved in an auto accident about 8 months ago and these attorneys helped save me. They handled my case from start to finish and were able to get me a settlement i would have never imagined. They were always available if i had a question or needed guidance throughout the case from start to finish. I’m so happy I chose them! Thank you<//Text>

<Review>My Honest review. Read your contract! I DO NOT Recommend giving them 45% or higher plus law firm fees and all the crazy fees they apply.  Their “professional” friends also apply crazy fees! They are all crooks! This was my fault for hiring them! I regret it big time! I Do NOT recommend B&D Law Group, APLC to any of my friends and family members or those people looking for an attorney. They work for them and not necessary for client satisfaction. I took it as, You get left overs from the pie. They are greedy and Nasty! If I can give 0 stars I would!  Their, Mistakes are the clients fault all the time! Hate this place and it’s “Professionals” And please save your time from responding back to my honest review about you! You DO NOT CARE FOR US!<//Review><Name>Angel Espinoza< /Name>< Resp>

I talked with a few different lawyers and I decided to go with them. They seemed to know most about the process with these ride share type of accidents. They took control right away.

I was injured while riding in a Lyft car. The other guy ran a red light and hit us. At first I didn't think I was hurt but then the next day my neck and back got super stiff. I had no health insurance and couldnt afford to go to emergency. They helped me get set up with doctors and I didn't have to pay anything out of pocket. Once I was feeling back to normal they settled my claim. Beyond impressed with my settlement. Thank you B&D!<//Review>

I absolutely recommend BD Law Group!! I was in a car accident and I'm so glad my cousin referred them! I've never used an attorney before and was nervous about what to expect. One of the attorneys, Babak, gave me a call and we went from there. They helped me with an incredibly annoying situation. I would never have gotten through this without them! Definitely reach out to B&D Law Group I wouldn't recommend anyone else!  They need a 10 star option on here!<//Text>

I had a GREAT experience with B&D Law Group.  I was a little afraid when I came across a few of these reviews. But I am more than pleased with my case results. Both attorneys Michael and Daniel were very informative and hands on. They were involved in my case the whole way. They also have a great staff behind them. Any time I had any questions I knew I could call Ryan for help, she was always available to take my calls. My advise is check them out for yourself, I am glad I did. Thanks guys! YOU ARE THE BEST!</Text>

<rate>1<//rate><review>I got into a car accident back in December of 2016 and case was dropped a year later for unknown reasons even when I asked for an explanation. Assistant was very attentive. Attorney however was okay, but they were difficult to get in touch with via text or phone call. Also failed to provide details on the case that would have saved me time. I got another attorney and this information would have saved me and the new attorney from trying to pick up where B & D left off.  A doctor they sent me to said I didn't need certain treatement and the firm still wanted me to get it against orders. All in all terrible experience and a great waste of my time.

I started my case in January right after the accident. Almost Everytime i end up calling them , anytime I needed an update I called. Everyone seem to have there own experience but it’s been a month and 2 days and they still haven’t called. They are attentive the assistant, but I have yet talk to the attorney. Not really sure if this is how auto accident settlements go but if this is the case I’m not really happy with my services.< /Review>

The best Commercial Truck Accident Attorneys in California!  B&D Law Group did a great job getting my case settled! I had an attorney who wasn't fighting for me, I was told because I was fighting a case with against a Commercial Truck that I should settle for whatever they offered. I was in a lot of pain, the situation was giving me headaches and I thought I should get a second opinion. Ryan was great and very informative. Her, Maria, Michael and Daniel were all outstanding! I'm extremely happy with my settlement. This team handled EVERYTHING from beginning to end. Thank you all!</review>

<review>Thank you soooooo much B&D LAW GROUP! You guys are amazing! I was tboned by an uninsured driver. My insurance said this accident wouldn't  be covered by my policy. I was confused. I thought thats what uninsured motorist meant. I reached out to see what my options were, I thought I was sol. Well my amazing team at B&D was able to confirm my policy details and was able to use my uninsured coverage to cover all my medical expenses as well as my pain and suffering and days I had to miss work. Thank you. 5 stars all the way.<//review><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None< /Resp><gmap_id>0x80c2bb9b34d9b743:0x5164de791d3c9706<//gmap_id></record>

Probably the best lawfirm I've ever used. Not that I've been involved in a ton of lawsuits, so maybe I'm speaking from inexperience, but I was blown away at the level of customer service and amount of personal communication I got from my attorney. Oh, and we won, so that helps!< /Text>

After screening a handful of attorneys, I'm glad I went with my instinct. When I first reached out to Ryan at BD Law I was confused, frustrated and beyond annoyed with the whole process. Everyone I spoke with before her seemed pushy and aggressive. She was kind, honest and funny. She mos def won me over. She told me to trust her and put it all in their hands, I did. I attended all my appts, let them do their thing and at the end of it all I can say I am extremely happy with my settlement. They really know their stuff. Thanks Ryan, Jonathan and Daniel!</Text>

<Review>I was a little skeptical hiring an attorney for my car accident. The insurance company was offering me $500 and was telling me if I hired an attorney they would get me the same plus take half of my settlement in fees. I called BD and spoke with Ryan. She was both knowledgeable and helpful at the beginning with alllll my questions and concerns. She also let me vent to her a few times :) I'm not going to lie, dealing with an accident is beyond stressful at times. But at the end of my case my team at BD got me a settlement 200x what the insurance co was initially trying to offer me. I couldn't be any happier with the outcome. Thank you Ryan, Nancy and Daniel!< /Review><rating>5</rating></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Highly disappointed on how this “law firm” keeps in touch with the client as well as how the concern about my health. The medical records have been available since 2 weeks ago but they are still somehow waiting on them, I guess there is places in earth where the time difference can be more than 2 weeks apart, I just found that out.
My recommendation to anyone looking for an injury lawyer, please do more research and keep this one as your LAST resource.<//Text><Date>1567023054974<//Date>< resp>

I've used them and they got me amazing results. They know litigation inside and out and know how to get great results for their car accident clients. They are very meticulous, which may explain why some people have suggested that they are "slow." They leave no stone unturned in their investigation of claims. They were able to find an umbrella policy for my case that none of the other lawyers was able to find. Other lawyers had rushed it and given up, but not them. I've since recommended them to many others who were injured in car accident and they have all been happy with their settlement results.  I would recommend them to anyone using a personal injury lawyer.</Text>

Very unprofessional,  empty promises that they’re going to fight for your medical bills and they don’t I’m still a client with them. I signed off on me & my daughter need one more to sign off.  I still haven’t  received any court documents they just want there 40% and they will take there sweet time. I would never  recommend this firm.<//Review>

DO NOT hire this company. I was in an accident one night driving home from work and I decide to hire an attorney. I ended up talking about my case with David, after we talked a couple times he made me feel like I was in good hands, he would answer the phone when I called him, call me back when he got information. So it's not until after they take my case that's it's given to a case manager, then passed along to another. That I didn't mind too much but when I called back to get some information on my case I find out my case manager "Maria Sanchez" is on vacation until the end of the following week, and her assistants didn't know the answers to any of my questions. Well after Maria got back from vacation, I was still here without my car, without a rental. Waiting........then I decided that I could probably handle things a little better. So I asked if I could discontinue the representation from their law group, which was less than a month from when they decided to represent me. I've been trying to contact Maria for the last month or so with no luck. I also noticed that another client of theirs recently won their case with the help of B&D, Well their case was involving a UPS driver. I thought it was strange the way they would respond to me when I told them I was going through a promotion at work to become a driver for UPS, it this seemed to play a major role in how I was later treated and disregarded. I just don’t see how law firms can still be in business when their so unethical. DO NOT CALL B&D LAW GROUP</review>

BEST AUTO ACCIDENT ATTORNEYS IN CALIFORNIA! Thank you Michael, Daniel, Babak and I cant forget about Ryan! I made a great choice by choosing this firm to help me. The insurance was screwing me over and only wanted to pay me $500 after breaking my arm in my accident. These AMAZING attorneys got me an AMAZING, unbelievable settlement! Ill admit I was a little hesitant at first, but I learned to not believe everything you read on the internet. Thanks again, honestly, I cant thank you guys enough.< /review>

Horrible! All they want is 40% of your settlement if your case goes longer than 6 months which they will make sure it does! You will never talk to a lawyer, very unprofessional law firm, I use law firm loosely. They will help you get high interest loans like 600 added to 1,000 loan and won't advise you prior. They DON'T care!! I'm an existing client and please take my advice! If you have a limited claim get a self help book from Nolo press and do it yourself. Don't run up medical bills when you can use your own insurance. B &D won't tell you anything you need to know!! Stay away!!<//Review>

If I could give this place negative stars I would. This is the worse experience that I have had. My accident was 3 years ago and they still have not closed it. I  keep getting the run around.  Every time I need an update I have to reach out to them first and sometimes they don't even email me back. I have had my lawyer switched on me 2 times without anyone telling me. I ADVISE EVERYONE TO STAY AWAY!. If I could turn back time and go a different route I would.</review>

I’ve had the pleasure of working with them on a personal injury case where the patient was in a car accident and suffered a neck injury and TMJ disorder as a result of the accident. They made sure that the client got fairly compensated for their injuries, as well as their pain and suffering. They handled the motor vehicle accident claim quickly and efficiently.  They ended up getting the client maximum compensation for her injury claim.</text>

Their business is to make bogus injury claims for their clients. This is a racket of lawyers who lie and their lying doctor friends. They are basically committing insurance fraud. Agents are watching you ...< /Review>

I would not recommend this office to anyone.  The initial experience was satisfactory, only because the person I spoke to seemed concerned and had some customer service skills and explained the process.   The next steps were unacceptable, the office has a high turn over rate that the doctors initially called were not contacted after the first appointment was cancelled by the doctors office.
Now over a year later, they state there us a settlement of $2000.00 and the lawyer (to whom I've never spoken to) is charging a lawyers fee of $910.00.
The Case Manager then has the audacity to tell me they are also going to contact the doctor's office to lower my balance....when I have no Balance.
Two days ago I requested the lawyer to contact me, as he was in court.  I have yet to receive the call.
I'm also waiting on the case manager (Josie)  to call back to let me know she sent me the bill with a break down of the lawyers work and invoice.
I never agreed to the settlement.
Very unprofessional.<//text>

<Pictures>None<//Pictures><text>B and D Law Group is by far the most professional and knowledgeable law group I have ever had the pleasure of working with!

Last year I was involved in an auto mobile accident where a drunk driver ran a red light and smashed into the side of our vehicle. My husband was in the passenger seat and his arm was broken and his leg had a fracture. It was an absolute mess. We knew we needed to find an attorney that can fight for us and provided the best representation.

After looking around we found b and d law group in Los Angeles. Their office is a beautiful office located on Santa Monica near Westwood.

We called and scheduled an appointment to meet with a lawyer to discuss our case. When we got there Daniel and Michael both met with us to discuss the situation and we were very satisfied with what they had to say so we decided to go with them.

They handled our case and dealt with the doctors and insurance companies like true professionals. They were able to get the case settled in an extremely quick fashion. I was truly impressed by their work and I couldn't have been any happier with the final result.

They always answered all of my calls and questions. They would even follow up with me weekly to check in and see how everything was going.

If you're involved in a car accident and need a legitimate personal injury attorney I would not think twice about working with this law firm. They are the absolute best! Hands down.<//text><Date>1497384062016< /Date></record>

I was in a bicycle accident a few years ago while out bicycling with some friends.   The truck that hit me refused to accept liability for running the stop sign.  I called a few lawyers, but they all told me my case was too conplicated. A friend of mine told me to call B&D Law Group, and that they had done a great job for her car accident claim.  I didn't know how this worked because I had never been in a car accident before, but their office took care of everything.  They helped me find the best doctors, and got me appointments with some of the best specialists in Los Angeles.  They fought the insurance company until they agreed to accept liability for my bicycle accident and made sure all my medical expenses and missed wages were covered.  They got me a money in my pocket that I never expected. I recommend them to anyone that's looking for a personal injury attorney for their personal injury accident.<//text>

<Review>AFTER SIGN, they NEVER call you back, and they DO  NOT have good behaviors at all. they will treat you well in first appointment, then it will never be repeated. They will change your case worker several time, and everyone tell you new lies. They will never take care of you, and you will pay for all of their mistakes.

12/28/2015 DO NOT USE Daniel D. Geoulla!!! These people don't care!  The only time that they have called me was to get my case!
*Update I was told in November that my case was in the process of being closed and should be ready by Feb 1. As of yesterday, it was barely getting sent out.

5/6/16 Same situation. I'm hoping to get some answers today and get to talk to Monica. P.< /text>

<Text>I can start off that I love this place. When I first walked in Natalie at the front desk was super nice!
She told me prices and explained everything they will be doing on my Dogs. Also Corey did a great job on grooming my Pomeranian. We asked for a hair cut. And left him looking super cute and smelling good!
Also my husky wasn’t shedding after they Bathed  her and  they left her with beautiful shiny coat of hair ! She was so soft.!
I appreciate that the workers made a good impression on the way they love animals. Thank you girls for everything! I will be coming back for sure!</Text>< pictures>

When we first got our puppy three years ago, we took him here on advice of a friend. We were very happy with the results and with the picture they got of him. This was going to be our spot since we wanted a picture of him growing up but we did not know we had to pay extra so we just stopped thinking about a picture and took him there for grooming's. In the past year while trying to book his appointment, the girl answering the phone would always say they had no appointments and it felt like they were screening the phone calls but we did not know that for a fact so we began taking him somewhere else. We called again and a different girl answered and said they had appointments available. We wanted his picture and requested it this time. 2 hours later, they call us to say he is ready but when we arrived, they had not taken his picture. The girl who helped on the phone (new girl) was very nice and helpful but a different girl, the one who always seems to say there are no appointments, went to the back with the new girl to try and get a picture of my dog. We could hear her screaming NO NO NO and aggressively telling our dog to sit and saying that she was not doing it because that she did not want to deal with him she proceeded to take out her anger yelling at and about my dog while we could hear her up at the front desk.  She then gave me his toothbrush and quickly hid by going to the back like a coward before I could confront her. I will not be taking my dog back to this place. To each their own, but if that is how she acted for a picture I can only imagine how they treat dogs that they "don't want to deal with." Not to mention I was actually told how good of a dog he was and how well behaved he was.< /review>

<Text>I would give a 0 star rating if possible, but I’ll let them have their little 1 star rating! I don’t know what goes on in the back with the groomer and these animals, but my dog has been limping ever since I picked him up from this location. I assumed maybe his nail was just clipped a little too short, but when I called the store to ask if there was an issue with my pet there was no concern voiced on their behalf AT ALL! Instead they blamed me and the dogs temperament. Calling him hyper and deflecting. My dog didn’t have any issue before he went in for his appointment! I have video proof showing how happy and normal he was able to move around while going inside the store. But after I picked him up, his energy level has been extremely low and he tries to walk with his paw up in the air. I know my dog! I’m with him everyday! I know his normal behavior and this is not it! Rather than deflect take accountability and show some concern for the people that patron your location. I didn’t say anything about the rushed service in the first place. I paid $55 for a service, that didn’t even appear fully completed in the first place. But when you show that your don’t even care for the well being of these animals....

I would just caution anyone that chooses this location. Hopefully this doesn’t happen to anyone else’s pet. It’s unfortunate they showed no concern for mine! Document everything and make sure you protect your animals!!!<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Date>1590780934984<//Date><UserId.>107725668129804563085</UserId.>< Response>

They did a fine job on my dog, but the girls there seem rushed. When I checked in I see this large wall explaining how they customize what you want for your dog (from type of shampoo, extras services, which bandana or bows the dog will get) but when the girls come to get my dog they just say "does she need any special shampoo? Ok good."  It felt very rushed and not very friendly.
Also there's a sign that says you have the take your leash and collar with you and they take the dogs to the back with the simple choke collar/leash combo. I don't love the choke collar but the main reason this bugs me is because I'm leaving my dog in this strange place without a collar and without ID. What if they switch the dogs up and the don't know who is who, or my dogs gets out and now she doesn't even have her name on her. I didn't say anything when they took her collar off but I felt uneasy the whole time.</review>

<Review>What I liked about them was that they had individual rooms for the grooming and the dogs weren't left in a cage.  What I didn't like outweighs that, and I'll never go there again.  1) my white dog had other black hair all over him;  2) his cut was never rinsed or blown off, so when I picked him up, I had tons of short white hair pieces all over me and my car;  3) the cut was HORRIBLE, he had 1-2" pics of uncut uneven hair all over his face and body; 4) his legs look like they weren't ever cut with large lines of demarcation around the tops of his legs where they met his body.  So I complained about the pieces hair, they blew it off, but there was still tons of pieces all over me and my car.  So I go elsewhere to get it fixed.  It turns out the sister of the groomer works at the other place I now love and was shocked that he looked so horrible after a cut 7 days ago.  I paid someone else to fix the horrible haircut.
So as if a bad grooming wasn't bad enough, I call to give them the feedback stupidly assuming they'd over to do it again or give me a partial refund.  Nope.  The "manager" Vincent (who sounds like he's very young) said, "sorry".  I waited and waited. So I said "that's it?  You're sorry?"  He said, "what else do you want me to do?". When I explained that there were many options for improving customer satisfaction and retention, he said no. He said there was nothing he could do - no partial refund, no offer to fix the cut or give a discount on a future cut. He just didn't care that the business failed.
Despicable service and horrendous grooming.
And so there's no confusion about my dog and his temperament.  He's a service dog.  He doesn't move or fuss or give any groomer in 5 years any difficulty at all. It was just a horrible service experience and horrible post service follow up.  Stay away. Be warned.  They aren't good and they don't care.</Review></record></dataset><record>

They ended up charging me $60 because of his size. They took that price down to $55 since I was paying cash. My dog is considered a small breed and is no where near being overweight or anything. They charged another lady ahead of me $70 for her large dog because she picked him up late. The lady said she didn't get any voicemail to pick him up and neither did I. They do a good job on the actual haircut but it seems they swindle money from people using excuses for the higher fee.
I called to complain and only heard "I'm sorry".
I will not be going back here because I don't know what mood they will be in when pricing my small dog.</Text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

Place needs a little better customer service. They do quality work and have a great business idea they just need to improve a few thing. I'm sure it will get better after the construction is done.</review>

I was so happy the first time I took my dog for grooming at this place... But today I’m extremely unhappy with the way you cut my dogs hair. You asked if we wanted the same cut and my wife said yes, but to do a very small trim on the face which is one of my dogs features... But what really pisses me off is that when I talked to you guys you weren’t capable of apologizing and putting the blame on my wife.
Please if you’re going to come to this place you need to be extremely specific on what you want!<//Review>

The portion size was for a kids meal and the gravy they used was horrible!! It smelt and tasted awful.
After a few bites I had to throw the whole thing away.
IF YOU GUYS ARE GOING TO CHRAGE A LOT FOR A SMALL PORTION OF PROTIEN AND CARBS, AT LEAST DO IT RIGHT.< /Review><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmapID>

Roman (the guys who helped) made sure our order was perfect and went the extra mile to make sure we had a perfect meal. The bbq short ribs were amazing! We also got the salad and French fries. So many places close early and thankfully he stays open late. Everything was clean and wonderful. We will back for sure.<//review>< pictures>

One of the best L&L Hawaiian Barbecue places in Westwood! Parking isn't too bad if you go to the side streets behind the restaurant.</review>

Owner of the restaurant is a grumpy old man who always gives attitude to anyone coming into restaurant to dine,  does not put in any value to his customers and has 0 customer service and moves slower than a turtle and treats his employees like utter garbage< /Review>

<Text>I love Hawaiian bbq. I even like the L&L franchise. What I do not like is this location. Food is not prepared with any care, and the management is too cheap to spare an extra to-go plate. Don’t worry, there’s tons of other eateries in spittin’ distance. :)< /Text>< pics>

<rate>1<//rate><text>If it we're possible to give this location a negative star review, I would. Of all the L&L locations that I've eaten at over the course of about 20 years, this Glendale location is the worst. From the terrible customer service at the counter, to the food that we ordered. The Kalua pork was dry and tasted like it was left over from earlier on in the week. I didn't think anyone could screw up french fries...... They did. When I brought up the quality of the food that we had ordered to the manager (same guy who cooked the food), and gave him the opportunity to make things right. He really didn't give a damn about his customers.

<text>Unpretentious yet delicious, this little hidden gem is only moments away from the hustle and bustle of the Americana. Open til late (10pm or 11pm depending on what day of the week), this is the go to spot for home style Hawaiian BBQ. With generous portions, you'll feel the Aloha spirit with every bite. Try the ever popular chicken katsu meal (w/ extra rice) and you'll immediately be hooked. Don't miss out on this place, brah. 😉</text>< Response>

Don’t waste your time here, they have a terrible rating for a reason!!!!! Terrible customer service and even worse food. I asked for a boba drink and the guy with the glasses at the front said they haven’t made any in a while and that I’m the first one to ask for one in 6 months. Literally a few customers after us asked for some boba drinks and they received them!!!! We waited disgustingly long for salty a** food and pork buns that smelled super old and the pork inside looked so gross. Don’t bother.<//review>

<Review>The Glendale location is probably the best one of these that I've been to. It's still an L&L when push comes to shove, but the friendliness of staff, quality of the food (especially the Malasadas) and the cleanliness give it bonus points. The only downside is that it's in a strip mall like area with plenty of other places around no real street parking but there are paid for garages. If you're already visiting the Americana this place is very convenient to stop and eat at considering you're probably going to pass by at picking up your car.<//Review><Date>1523859028958</Date>< rate>

<review>By far the best fresh Poke here in the Main land in So Cali, great service and I have tried other items on their menu and for an L & L franchise owned by Middle Easterns Americans they really make the effort to keep it traditional as if you were eating in the islands, it's my to go Poke place here in LA, Mahalo Nui.< /review>< pictures>

<Review>L&L Hawaiian BBQ located on Maryland Ave walking distance from the Americana in Glendale has a delicious menu of Hawaiian BBQ food. My first visit there I had asked what are their favorite dishes and we ordered and I shared with my friend a Chicken Katsu Saimin and a Big Poke. I am definitely going back again!<//Review>< Rate>

While it may not be the most authentic Hawaiian cuisine, it is definitely tasty and the prices are good! Very relaxed atmosphere and the service is always friendly</review>

While the food is technically Hawaiian fare, the execution is miserable. The breaded chicken cutlets were rather dry and totally tasteless. A forgettable, fast-food-type rendition of Hawaiian stereotypical dishes.</Text>

<Date>1468588854601</Date><text>Worst Chicken Katsu I have ever tasted. I bought the seafood combo ($11+), came with breaded shrimp and mahi-mahi and choice of third item. Unfortunately I chose the chicken katsu which was so thin, dry and tasteless it could have been breaded cardboard. The other items were ok and the mac salad is always a favorite, but I would not come to this location again.<//text><user>109058871046759441546<//user></record>

Found it by chance. The staff is super friendly. The parking lot isn't great, but people are constantly coming and going. The space is ample enough. The ice cream is really rich and creamy! Really liked the various and interesting flavors and selection.</Text>

<text>The Boba here is good and the lumpia is fire! They are  definitely raking it in with the Caucasian novelty prices ( almost $5 for a Boba) but I don't expect any less from this neighborhood. The inside has a nice hang area and board games, TV and tables to relax, do work, or just sit. It can be a little loud with the teeny boppers buzzing around but just bring headphones. The froyo selection is pretty good too and overall I enjoy  the place, I just find it expensive, but hats SF for ya.</text>< Time>

The variety in flavors and consistency with taste across the board is unlike any other yogurt place I've been too. I've been coming here since they opened, and it still has yet to fail me (probably never will)! Jocelyn was super helpful the night we came in, definitely will continue to come back!!< /review>

<review>Wish I found this cute store earlier! Love the glass light bulb. Definitely generous with the portion size! And it was pretty cheap! ($6.50 including the light bulb for ~$2 extra). I decided to get peach black tea with mixed jelly. Fresh orange and lemon slices made the drink refreshing :)<//review>< name>

Two words: Butterscotch Pudding! I get cravings for this pudding all the time. Like Jem, it is truly outrageous! I have had other items such as the red velvet cupcake, one of their salads and they don't quite make me want to give them a 4 star rating. Still worth it for the pudding!</text>

<date>1566658026346< /date><rating>2<//rating><Review>My son had the mango smoothie with added bubbles. Good taste, but upwards of $12. I had the black milk tea, but had to add the bubbles. I had expected the bubbles to come with the tea drinks - not be a 50 cent add on for a measly scoop.  Lukewarm and not a very strong tea flavor. Came out to $6. This is way too pricey for what you get. Granted they are in a high rent district, but let's be real.  The bubbles, however, were good - not too mushy or too firm. So many good bubble tea options out there for less than half the price. And not a very pleasant environment - kind of sterile white decor with one tv screen playing ???. To be fair, did not try other options like frozen yoghurt or musubi. Those might be worth trying. But not going back for bobba tea drinks.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

<review>This place makes good frozen yogurt, and I absolutely love their non dairy options. Strawberry almond milk tastes delicious! The snacks are hit or miss but when they're a hit they're really tasty. The tofu musubi is my favorite item on the menu. The reason I gave a 3 star rating is that their milk tea has been subpar every time I've gone there, which I don't think should be the case since most of their menu is centered around milk tea. I recently ordered a Dark Roast Oolong Milk Tea with boba pearls, 50% sweetness, and with soy milk. When I drank it, I was immediately met with disappointment. I wasn't sure what I was drinking, but it definitely was not milk tea. It tasted more like watered down almond milk with tea essence sprinkled in. Not tea leaves, but very faint tea essence. And I couldn't tell you what type of tea essence it was because it honestly tasted like nothing. Of course, I ordered 50% sweetness, but I feel like if the tea and milk are good enough quality and mixed right the sweetness should not be what makes or breaks the drink. Additionally, the boba pearls were terrible. They were stale and flavorless. I literally spat out the ones I tasted because they were so unappetizing in my mouth. Cuppa is a really cute place that has an awesome variety of food and drink options, but they seriously need to get it together when it comes to their drinks.< /review>< user_id>

Quick and tasty bubble tea. A little on the pricey side for the bubble tea but there is a wide selection of flavors. They also serve snacks, including self-serve frozen yogurt - I haven't had these personally so can't rate them. They've redecorated some since this place was called Rockit Swirl. There are some Japanese capsule vending machines, a bunch of tables, and a small selection of board games to play. They are definitely angling to be a teen hangout spot in the neighborhood, but it's also a good spot for families with kids to get a treat.< /review>

Had this place bookmarked in G+ for a year and a good reason.  Walked right in with no line, then line grew.  $6 Got 2 biggie scoops on a waffle cone with specialized flavor I never heard of.  Cinnablonde was delicious like cinnamon toast crunch.  And jacker crack butter toffee and cracker jack.  Fun hip vibe with gangster rap music which fits the neighborhood.  A place to celebrate for sure.< /review>

Maybe not the best for Boba, but regret not trying the Musubi while I was still in the area. Great froyo place however, order that instead of Boba. People's opinion will differ. Service wasn't amazing, but the place was clean and the order was made very quickly.< /Text>

<Review>We have been in the areas long enough to see this location change hand 3-4 times. None of them seemed to stick, but maybe Cuppa will.

They are still doing the combo froyo/boba thing.

So the tea and boba are fine. Not great, but fine. I do love me some popping boba which they have. Spam masubi is decent. All is a bit expensive, but the area demands it.

We come back, so, while not our favorite boba place, it hits the spot when needed.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< user_id>

<rate>1</rate><Text>Bought a floor model guitar from the Cerritos Guitar Center. It was priced at $1000.00. The guitar had scratches and clear wear on it. Manager said he would take $50.00 off the guitar. I bought it. Got home and discovered the guitar sells new for  $950.00 per Guitar Center web page. In short I paid full price for used gear. Took it back for full refund. Cerritos store manager  can't be trusted. He's an A-hole. Other stores cell the same guitar for $950... Not sure why the Cerritos store feels the need to overcharge their customers. Sadly for $50.00 that stores manager lost over a thousand dollar sale. On the plus side the cashier who assisted me with the purchase and refund was super friendly.  A clear professional who should probably be in charge of that store. Her manager could learn a lot from her.<//Text>< pics>

I ordered a used wine red Epiphone Les Paul PlusTop Pro from guitar center and have been let down tremendously. I called to ask about the condition of the guitar, and was told that yes, it had some blemishes, but that the electronics in the  guitar was in great working condition, and that they would have it set up before it was shipped out. To my dismay, I’ve just not received a quality product, and feel as though I was led to believe this product was something that it was not.

1) Long shipping time. Understandable with COVID-19, but they did take 3 weeks when the time was listed as 3-5 days.

2) Original ad said it included a case. No case was delivered

3) Upon opening, notice cosmetic damage is much worse than anticipated. The original picture was taken in a way that the lighting obscured most of the major scratching of the finish.

4) I asked that the guitar be set up before it shipped, and the woman on the phone obliged. However, when I received it, there’s major fret buzz on the low E string that would require maintenance to fix.

5) I was told that the electronic hardware was all good and ready. Upon receiving, the audio out jack was loose, and the cord must be held in a specific position to keep the connection to the amp from cutting in and out.

6) The pickup toggle is loose, and instead of just having 3 positions, the middle position allows the toggle to move back and forth as though it’s been broken before.

Overall, I feel like I was led on to believe that this guitar was in good condition all except for some cosmetic damage. If that were the case, I would be far less frustrated, but the fact that the electronics were not in perfect condition tells me that Guitar Center doesn’t actually care to refurbish or improve damaged materials they buy for resale. It shows me a lack of effort in taking care of used materials, and it’s really disappointing as a brand new guitarist to receive something that is so beat up without realizing that’s what I was getting into. Definitely shopping elsewhere in the future.<//text>

Bought a smoke machine and was told there was juice with it. Then fot to event  opened and nothing. Lesson learned. Never take the word from sales man. Then they sell equipment  as as for same price new. I finally decided to buy first time for lighting equipment and this was bad experience. Have worked and done many events in the valley  for before GC even  come here so does  it matter not really . Instruments yes gear no .< /text>

I have NEVER looked at anything at Guitar Center as I don’t play any musical instruments and don’t know anybody that does. I have gotten 4 calls and 2 voicemails in the last 5 days (all at 8/9am when I work late and don’t go to bed until like 3am) from someone working there just to see if I have any questions or need help with anything. I’m pretty sure they have the wrong number, which I totally understand happens all the time. However, if you call someone even twice and leave a voicemail and they don’t answer, that should be your clue to STOP CALLING. I will never even think about GC after this and reading the reviews. Support local businesses instead!!!<//review>

<Review>Paid for an item never received confirmation. Was reassured everything was fine and it was on its way. Asked that the confirmation to be sent again. Twenty minutes later received an email the order was cancelled. Wasted more than an hour on the phone and now have to go somewhere else to buy a gift. There is no way I would trust them at this point. Not surprised they are having financial issues.</Review>< pictures>

I ordered a gift for my niece. They sent the wrong color. I called and got a very nice guy who told me he would send me a new one overnight as it was a birthday gift, and I was now going to have to spend extra money to ship it to her more quickly. He said he would call me after he processed my new order with a credit from the old one. I never heard back from him. I called today. He never processed the new order. Today’s guy wouldn’t shut up about how they don’t usually do things like that. I said I didn’t care, and that it wasn’t my idea in the first place. He said, “I’m just trying to tell you that’s not how we do it.”  Do I care?  He sounded totally annoyed and acted like I had done something wrong. Just get me my ukulele and move on. Then he says “at least you’re saving $10 this time.”  Ummm. Over an hour of my time and the stress of having to follow up to make sure they do their job is worth a lot more than $10 but thanks anyway. My first experience with this company, and I’m done.<//Review>

<UserId.>104533994175441002834<//UserId.><Review>DO NOT BUY anything from Guitar Center online or in one of their stores. I wish I had read these reviews before making a purchase. WORST business I have ever dealt with.  I ordered a guitar and waited months for it, in the meantime they charged me and would not give me money back while they conducted an investigation. They would not respond to multiple emails and I finally got my money back after disputing the transaction through my credit card company. Magically the next day the guitar was found and they offered to make it right by expediting the shipping and giving me a discount.  But wait there is more ...then they backtrack on their offer- They will give a discount if I pay regular retail price not off the sale price I originally paid.. and no they cannot expidite shipping even though I have waited 3 months for the guitar.  Just place the order and they will take care of it..... right!  Look at the reviews, they run a shady business and can't be trusted. Spend your money elsewhere!<//Review><rating>1<//rating>< Pictures>

Was trying to get my DJ mixer serviced by the manufacturer, all I needed was my proof of purchase which should be easy right? Well contacted  guitar center and first I was told they couldn’t find my account after giving my name and email, then I called support and was told the only record they have is of headphones I purchased which is completely false. I’ve spent over $1000 in store and all they can find is a purchase for headphones. I will never do business with them again since they can’t even keep customer records.<//text>

<review>Worse customer service and support in the industry and it's not hard to imagine why, when you look at who runs this company. Its ran by a bunch of corporate bean counters, who have no involvement in the music industry. I purchased a set of Rockit 8's I was told that the speakers were damaged and that they could sell at a discount, I'm sorry I don't want junk in my studio. I offered a solution to roll my balance into store credit and I would go to a branch and pay the difference and get some nicer speakers. They refused it and refused to help. Now my money is in limbo, and I have no monitors. I strongly advise all of you to NEVER do business with this joke of a company, especially when there's companies like Sweetwater who go way above and beyond to make sure their customers are satisfied. My mistake for thinking Guitar Center was competent enough to handle a small speaker order.< /review>< Resp>

The store near me (Wilmington, DE) has a wide selection of merchandise and fantastic customer service.  The guys there are pretty knowledgeable and they will often work with you to beat competitors' pricing.  I recently had an issue with a keyboard I ordered from a store in California.  The guys at the Wilmington store not only helped me to work through it, but they also gave me a great deal on a case.  The keyboard itself was an excellent bargain too, by the way.  Anyway, the experience was so positive, that I had to share it here.</Text>

I ordered a speaker and protective bag two months ago and got a price match.  The unit they sent was clearly not new and did not come with the bag nor did I get a receipt for my records.  I've made countless phone calls, several managers and salespeople, unanswered emails and phone messages, and even sent two letters to their corporate customer service.  Same not new unit and no proof I even purchased it.  To boot it turns out they never even carried the bag they were supposed to send, the girl that took the order got the wrong email, shipping, and billing address, allegedly put my purchase through a fraud check and managed to get a nearly $1000 charge through.  Never, ever again.< /text>

They canceled my order! NO email, NO notice! I ordered a pair of KRK Rokit 10 G3s great deal used ...then cancelled..Their reason? The shipping address wasn't to my house? It was to my friend's work. I was a gift. I'd been shopping around for months! No verification email to alert me. Nope! You don't get to have them. "They're gone...sorry..."still haven't given back my money..I have to wait 3-5 days.. I better get my money back.. can't go shopping until I get refunded. My first time experience = cheated..</text>

GuitarCenter online and call center have no clue what each other are doing.  If you have an issue, do not expect anyone at the call center to help, and they do not even have a supervisor that can talk to you about an escalated issue.  I ordered and PAID FOR strings On Jul 15 and its Aug 10 and I haven't received them, even though they are in stock. They cancelled my order today without any resolution....I have been waiting for nothing.  POOR SERVICE - NO COMMUNICATION - NO RESOLUTION SKILLS.  GO TO SWEETWATER OR AMERICAN MUSICAL SUPPLY.<//Text>

I was in the 36116 (zip) store to buy the Stanton T.62b standard turntable. I had call earlier but I never got a call back. I went in store and was directed to the back. One guy had to leave another guy directed me to another person and as I waited I was in pain because I have Parkinson's disease so I asked for the manager he never came. I want to see how bad the service really was I sat down and the store ignored me and help other customer. When the manager finally came out he didn't even acknowledge me. People I'm surprised their still in business and I would like corporate to know that is bad for business and money is green no matter what person hands it comes from or their physical condition......<//review>

I just quit the Guitar Center Call Center located in Indianapolis, IN located at 6625 Network Way Suite 200. I started this past Monday 07/23/2018. This is THE MOST unprofessional call center I have EVER seen. The training was absolutely horrible. The Roadies were cursing and talking about other employees. One of the Roadies (Jeremy) has only been there 8 months and they see that he's fit enough to start training people?! He's still new! He got his girlfriend a job who was also in my class, so they were constantly referring to each other as babe. Again, unprofessional! Yesterday, my class was thrown on the phones due to another center having technical issues, which is understandable. But! When you have 7 new people on the phones that know absolutely nothing there needs to be support for those employees when questions arise, and yep, you guessed it! When you needed a question answered there was no one around. Roadie Jeremy left us hanging while him and his babe (new hire) could go on break together. Now the reason why I quit. Today, 07/26/2018 I go to work. As soon as I clock in Roadie Jeremy tells me the training supervisor wanted to speak with me in her office, of course I have no clue who it is because she NEVER introduced herself to us! I go into her office and she puts her hand out and says, "Oh it's nice to finally meet you". I should've met her within the first 2 days if she's my immediate supervisor! I sat down and she asked me how training is going, I said, "Okay, but there needs to be better support". She agreed. She then tells me the reason why I was pulled. She tells me that 3 managers spoke to me on 07/25/2018 in regards to my language on the floor. I was immediately livid! I was already displeased with the unprofessionalism, now I'm being presented with a bold face lie! I took my badge off immediately and quit! I never cursed on that floor. I have been working in call centers overall for 6 years, believe me, I KNOW proper phone etiquette. As I walked out of her office I asked, "Who said it?". That right there should be a GREAT indicator that it's a lie, because if I talked to these individuals, shouldn't I already know?! She responded by saying she's not going to tell me of course. I left the office and went back to the training room to grab my stuff. When I got back to the training room I said something to Jeremy along the lines of, "You like to lie huh?". Of course he acted stupid and gave the typical, "I don't know what you're talking about" response. I said, "You know exactly what I'm talking about." He then responded with, "Oh, you have a problem?" And we all know when a person says that, they are initiating a fight! As I previously stated, completely unprofessional office! There needs to be some MAJOR changes in that place and it needs to start by the big wigs at GC coming to Indy and weeding out the bad apples one by one and getting some good, professional talent in there. Until then, if you live in Indianapolis and you come across this review and are considering employment at GC, I strongly suggest you look elsewhere.<//Text>

Guitar Center is a train wreck, doesn't matter which location, they want you to buy the most expensive with very little effort on the sales people side and mint money.....don't we all wish life was like that ... free money with zero effort.  GC is clueless about service or sales, I just go back to my local place for the tech and go no where near the sales floor.  Now I am in a happier place at Sweetwater and Elderly Instruments.  Ya, its catalog place but at least they know what customer service means.</review>

I had yo wait 30 min. Just to return a rental! This place is a joke. All of the employees are just standing at the front, really careless of the customers that need help. I asked for help, they were just telling me they didn't know how to do a returned rental. Horrible experience. I hope it's just this location! Lake Forest Ca.</Review>

<Review>I have a manager at store 613 in Cincinnati  Named Nick that's been giving me the run around for the past 3 months on him emailing me some past transaction history on my account. He's beyond rude. And customer service never answers the phone or return voicemails. TERRIBLE!!!! I wish I could give 0 stars. and it's sad because I get most of my big purchases from guitar center and because of 1 manager that doesn't do his job, I will be taking my business elsewhere.</Review>< Rate>

Guitar Center & Musician's Friend unlawfully kept my debit card information (given online to determine shipping but no order was ever placed), and illegally charged my card for $300. After speaking w/a rep, I was told that the item had been stopped in transit and that I would be refunded $370.95 to cover the fraudulent charge and overdraft fees. The next day, a DEBIT of $370.95 was stolen from my cancelled card. A supervisor by the name of Cassie Dean insisted that Guitar Center was not responsible for these fraudulent charges. She also stated that "both items were ordered on the 5th of May". I later found out from a different rep that there was no second item associated w/the $370.95! Ms. Dean wrote me to insist that Guitar Center was not liable and absolutely refused to return my money, in spite of the bank, police, AND Attorney General's office confirming that they ARE responsible. Guitar Center has stolen nearly $1,000 from me, for an item that I never ordered & is being returned and for AN ITEM THAT DOES NOT EVEN EXIST. These companies are THIEVES and commit FRAUD against consumers!<//Review>

<Text>Absolute worst customer service, and I've been dealing with AT&T for years. Over charge me. Tell me a rep will contact me shortly. That was a week ago. Closest location is 40mins away. They don't care about their customers. Sweetwater and Sam Ash and local is the way to go.< /Text>< Pics>

< Review>
I've called a few times over the past few weeks, nobody would return my calls.  I took my guitar into the guitar center in Naperville IL for a setup, when I got the guitar back it was so messed up, I took it back after a week and was told nothing was wrong with it,  I had to purchase another guitar from sweetwater because it wasn't even playable.  I called the guitar center for a year and a half before talking to a manager.  Here's what that $130 setup cost me :  I thought it was the blackstar ht20 amp head and cab so I sold it for a loss of $200, went through a few other amps with terrible sound, finally purchased a guitar from sweetwater on black Friday for $600, had to have the other guitar re setup with the pickups redone because it was so screwed up and not even done right, the volume pods had to be changed for another $110 from Hix Brothers down the street, and didn't need to buy a new amp for $500.  Resolution ?  The manager offered me 10 pairs of strings, I have some I got from sweetwater anyway, then offered me a $50 credit which means I have to spend more money on something from a place that where not only the corporate office doesn't return calls or have to go to a place that screwed up my guitar so bad that it cost me $1500 after I paid for a $130 setup when the guy has no business touching a guitar to begin with.  Customer service is horrible, I plan on posting on ripoff report, and other sites like it because of the way I was handled.   Still no resolution.</Review>

BUYER BEWARE. Went to try guitars in Baltimore location with the intention to buy Gibson, Epiphone or Fender. Manager didn't care that was a bit put off by a broken neck (truss rod cover and strings held it together!) and another with broken strings. Last straw was the cracked headstock from nut edge on both sides on a Gold Top. NO QUALITY CONTROL.</review>

I'm so disgusted that I will cut up my card and never purchase anything from Guitar Center.  I sold things back to them because of an emergency but in truth they just don't care about their customers.

Very disappointed

Good evening, I arrived at the Hollywood store upon opening on Memorial Day with every intention on spending 10k via the vintage shop or ordering a Fender Masterbuilt. I was not greeted by anyone so I ventured into the Vintage section. There was an employee with his head down staring at his iphone and never looked up. I picked up about three vintage guitars and he still said nothing. I asked him if he had any Masterbuilts and he looked extremely annoyed he had to move. He walked over to show me one custom shop and still did not look up from his phone. He was texting the whole time. I asked him what the process was to order one and he just said email me. That's it? Just email him. His name is Cat. That is the experience I have every time I enter a GC. I don't know if you guys promote the I am better than you environment but it sure seems like it. In fact, I went to GC Northridge to buy my first guitar a year ago and the experience was so bad I left, drove down to Sam Ash and bought an American Standard Strat. Since my experience on Monday I have purchased two Masterbuilt strats, one from Norm's in Tarzana and one from Wild West guitars and placed and order for another one with Wild West since Dave is an incredibly nice guy. That is 15k you guys missed out on because of jerk employees. The only pleasant experience I have had at a GC is the new one in Westlake. Another experience I had was at the Northridge location. A Marshall amp came in that I have been asking about for sometime. It was a JTM30. When I picked it up to buy it an employee bragged how he bought it right when it came in. How is that acceptable? An employee has first dibs on gear that can be sold to a customer at a higher price? It is totally ridiculous. Anyhow, I thought corporate should know what is going on from a "could have been" client that spends a decent amount of money on gear. I would much rather spend my money at Sam Ash, Norm's, Wild West or any other spot where they are actually nice to me and seem like they are happy to help.<//review>

Horrible I'm trying to open up a studio and I ordered everything I needed and they refused to ship me my MacBook first the website says in stock and available to ship (and still does)  then I receive an email stating that it's on back order and after days had gone by I didn't get an update so I decided to call to see what was going on, the sales representative said "oh we do have them " " that he's going to contact the sales team and see what's going on" never got a call back so I called again to get more misinformation after they charged me, claiming that the manufacturer isn't sending them anymore that they don't have them in stock and when I mentioned that I was going to contact corporate about their unprofessionlism the guys attitude changed but I'm still contacting corporate because if I order something send me my items not hold them hostage for your own personal reasons, I'm furious about the way they handled this matter!<//text>

<Rate>1</Rate><review>(Translated by Google) It is the worst place on earth to shop. Exactly 20 days ago I ordered some studio monitors online, this order was canceled three times because every week they changed the delivery date, now they say that they did not take the money from my account, but in my bank it appears that they took it. It seems that they think I'm going to give them a little more than 400 dollars

The staff was very helpful! Since this was our first time getting ahi poke they let us sample some of their favorites. Of course they were all good. I would recommend this place for first timers like myself.<//Text>

Good poké place with lots of topping options! Everything is fresh and delicious! Small inside so either take it to go or eat outside on a nearby picnic table (you’ll have to deal with the planes overhead, like everywhere at Liberty Station).<//text>

The girl working alone this Saturday earned all 5 stars. The lines for every restaurant were out the door. She kept her composure, worked super fast, apologized for the wait although she didnt need to, and ever had conv with the guests as well as knowing the menu to assist first timers. Well earned young lady. 5 stars and a 5 dollar tip for you!<//Text>

Pretty much tried everything on the menu...and the specials too!

The attention to detail and preparation makes "the House" my eternal favorite...  Nothing is flat in terms of sophistication and the blending of delicate flavors.

My favorites are the "Seasonal Tea Smoked Duck Breast, Pork Chops and any of the Grilled Fish...".  Seafood has never been my forte, but they made a believer out of me...

Angela's desserts are out of this world and she's also an incredible host...  I have never been disappointed.  Tried & True Art!< /text>

Portion sizes were great (plenty of food). Loads of options to get it just the way you like it. Reasonable prices. Some indoor seating and lots of outdoor seating. Easy parking nearby. Great place, would definitely recommend it if you like poke.</Review>

Best Poke bowl I've ever had. Always clean and fresh. Service is impeccable and we are more than happy to travel 30mins for it. The surroundings and seating area has a beautiful vibe and the water feature in the centre of the square always sets a nice tone.< /text>

< Review>
Love this place- their marinated Ahi, and spicy tuna are the best. I love that they make it simple, perfectly customizable and fast. The staff are friendly, knowledgeable and patient with first timers lol. Unlike a lot of other places you don’t have to pay extra for your sides (just avocado) and they offer more options than most.< /Review>

Fish was good. I like the bowl idea, simple and easy. Flavor was good. I do wish they used wild fish and not farmed.< /Review>

Their prices have gone up and the serving got so small. For the price I don't think it's worth it. I can't say the food is good knowing how much it cost.< /Review>

<Review>What an amazing experience!! Tim and Erin’s Hospitality makes you feel like you are with family from the moment you step out of your car to the moment to step out of the basket. Sky Drifters is truly an amazing experience. You can find them like I did on the Sircles App @sirclesapp. Thanks guys can’t wait for the next trip in the skies!

Horrible horrible. I booked on-line but then was taking the weekend off e-mailing. I went to meet them at 0630 (weather looked fine) and no one was there. I had to call 3x before got a real person. they were rude on phone, saying it was cancelled due to smoke and I was supposed to check-in the night before. When I got home I e-mailed them and asked to reverse the charge. I received a rude e-mail back saying that I should have checked in and that I was never charged. I was in fact charged. Unbelievable. Stay away.</review>

What an AMAZING experience!!! I was so nervous about being in a hot air balloon and I can not say more how great it was! Tim and his wife were the perfect people to fly with. Both were so knowledgeable, Tim was answering questions we didn’t even think to ask or wonder about and his wife was FABULOUS and took every kind of picture possible. She was so sweet!
I never once felt unsafe. From beginning to end, the team was a total well oiled machine. It was very clear that Tim knew what he was doing and was so passionate about it!
We ended the flight in a gorgeous field, with a little history, some amazing stories and the Balloonists Prayer. We were so sad to have the experience end, Tim and his wife were incredible, personable and we felt like we’d known them for years. Thank you SO much Sky Drifters!! I’d spend every weekend this way if I could, GO GO GO!<//review>

<Text>Tim, his amazing wife (who is also a stellar photographer), and awesome crew took great care of us!  I booked our flight as a surprise 40th birthday gift for my beau.  Prior to attempting to launch Tim ensures that the conditions are safe enough for flight.  This does require some patience as we no control over Mother Nature.  However, the attention to detail and safety measures exercised really made us feel really comfortable.  When the weather allowed us launch, we were up and away on an amazing adventure.  Tim is very knowledgeable and has the best stories! The Champagne toast after landing was the icing on the cake. Looking forward to drifting in the sky again.

<text>LONG overdue review for the most amazing business I ever encountered. Service, Quality, Expectations and just about everything was amazing. Right at 5am in the morning Erin is greeting you with her bubbly and amazing smile, to Tim's fire blowing balloon riding experience. I couldn't have asked for a better place to have the hot air balloon with such a professional! He is going to be expanding in different locations and my friends and I are planning to follow and go to each and every one of them!< /text><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>{'time': 1575584814598, 'text': 'Wow!

What an AMAZING time! I had the opportunity to completely surprise my fiance with Sky Drifters Hot Air Ballooning!  One of the most professional and amazing companies I have ever worked with. Thank you so much for making the day memorable.  We both loved their enthusiasm and love for hot air ballooning and could not have asked for a better time. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!<//review>

Unbelievable!  As many have said, Tim is a very knowledgeable and conscientous pilot.  He takes his responsibilities very seriously, yet provides a fun and relaxing experience.  Erin is a great entertainer and while you are waiting to go up in the basket, she keeps you busy with pictures.  If anyone has any nerves, she keeps you busy with pictures and gets all the photo opportunities she can.  We had a wonderful time and appreciated the professionalism of the team.</Text>

Had a great and peaceful ride! The owners are so sweet, and very knowledgeable. You definitely feel safe. They will also not hesitate to cancel the flight if they think the conditions are too dangerous, which is nice to hear. Silly to admit, but it was fun watching the cows run away from the balloon.<//review>

I think we had the longest flight ever!  It was awesome! Flying over the beautiful Oak tree's, seeing turkeys, cows, all kinds of wild life. So different than Napa.  It was a wonderful flight and Tim sure knows his stuff!  Can't wait to do it again!  My favorite part was, when we drifted down near the cows they all came running.  As if we were the wizard of OZ!   it was so neat!  Just seeing the beauty of the foothills was incredible....

I don’t have enough words to express what Tim, Erin and their whole family did to provide an AMAZING experience to me and my gf (who became my fiancé in the balloon). Tim and his whole family treated us like their own members of the family instead of customers. Erin takes amazing pictures so you don’t even have to hire a photographer!! I’d highly recommend if you’re looking for a lovely experience!</Text>

Everything about our hot air balloon adventure was absolutely top rate.  With our friends coming all the way from United Arab Emirates there were challenging schedule issues that Sky Drifters accommodated.  The preflight briefing was thorough and made us all very comfortable with the high level of safety they maintain.  The balloon basket itself was a great size for us.  Not too crowded but not immense like a cattle car.  A bonus was the swinging door that allowed us to walk in rather than having to climb over the rail.

The flight itself was spectacular.  Watching the sun rise over the Sierra Nevada was a postcard perfect moment.  Then we flew over some of California's most beautiful oak grasslands.  Except for no lions or hippos it felt like we could have been over Africa's Serengeti Plain (which is way beyond our budget).

The owner and his wife personally ensured that this was a trip of a lifetime.

The weather was perfect and Tim's knowledge and experience made for a beautiful flight.  Erin joined us on board and was a  great addition to our flight.  Tim's knowledge of the history of ballooning was a definite plus to the day and I would advise anybody who wishes to go balllooning to call Sky Drifters for the best possible experience.

<rating>1<//rating><Review>"People with coupons are jamming us up" This is the comment these people made to me when I tried to use my voucher. When I 1st contacted them they told me that "Currently it is early in the season and we don't have a single Monday with other people booked int he next 60 days. We will contact you as soon as we can find a group to ride with you." They never did. When I recontacted them a month later they said "We are booked solid into the first week of June and not prebooking any more flights until June". My voucher expired June 13th so I told them I would be open for any flight, any day please let me know when I could fly and their response was "we can't notify folks. We tried that and spent hours emailing people. Contact us be email and day you can fly the next if we don't answer we don't have the spot". So I'm suppose to send them an email and then sit around waiting and I might not ever hear from them. Is this any way to run a business? Amazon Prime was very gracious and refund me my money although I wish I could have taken the flight. It looked like a great deal and it is something I have wanted to do my whole life. (By the way all quotes are from their emails to me)<//Review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>
{'time': 1431967697668, 'text': 'Sorry the stand-by option was difficult for you Alan.  We tried emailing everyone on the stand-by list before and all that accomplished was upsetting everyone that responded after the slot was gone.  That took hours and hours each day to email everyone and wait for their responses.  It angered people that did not get the slot and was worse than having people email us.\n\nWe recently returned from the Balloon Federation of America Conference.  There was an entire seminar on "Deal Sites"  The take-away from that seminar was "No matter how hard you try, no matter what you do, there will be a percentage of "coupon chasers" that are simply impossible to make happy.  They refuse to work with the limitations of the offer and are demanding beyond reason.\n\nEvery single one star review of our company anywhere was from a refunded "couponer" that was difficult on the phones during booking.  To date we have flown over 1600 people with coupons and 95% were great folks.  Yet the other 5% have been so awful to deal with that we will never offer a "deal" again.  For us that is sad as some of the people we took could have never afforded to fly otherwise and we love sharing the experience of ballooning.  It is why we do what we do.  We would fly people for free every day of our lives if we could afford to.  It is our passion.'}</Response>

<Review>We haven't gone on our trip yet BUT..I have to tell you that they have been AMAZINGLY patient and worked HARD to get the four of us into the schedule.  Due to my changes and some conflicts they had to schedule and re schedule me several agonizing ( for them I'm sure) times but I NEVER felt like I was a pain in the you know what..  I'm sure I was but they did whatever they could to accomadate and make it work.....Just had to let everyone know that because its not often that people will accomadate to the extent they did.....   When we come back at the end of Oct I will let you know how it went!!!< /Review>< pics>

< Review>
My dachshunds (several since 2012) and I continue to see Dr. Woods and his staff because there simply is no one better.  Knowledgeable, compassionate, professional, friendly, and patient people, they do their best to provide the best possible care for my dogs while making sure I understand (and agree with) the treatment protocol.  They combine holistic procedures and medications with "Western" medicine, tailoring the treatment to the greatest benefit of the pet.  I appreciate each of them.<//Review>

Dr Woods, Julie and the office staff are always friendly, knowledgeable and professional.  We are happy to drive 45 minutes to have our two Border Collies cared for by Dr Woods and his staff.  We have had lots of fur babies and have gone through several vets that were very disappointing in terms of not being open to considering both traditional and alternative therapies in order to find what works for a particular dog at different stages of life.  We are very glad to have found Dr Woods and highly recommend him.  He is a great vet that actually cares about his patients.  That quality, I am sorry to say, is unfortunately somewhat rare these days.<//Text>

<text>There is a character limit on Google review. I wrote a lengthy yet important review on Dr. Woods and our experience with him on yelp.  I would not recommend him and if you already use him, make sure you always get a second opinion and ask for all your test and vet records.< /text><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

I just recently visited Dr. Woods with my 14 y/o Jack  Russell.  He gave us a good consult and diagnosis that should have been picked up from my dog's primary vet long ago and perhaps avoided complications.  I hope to establish a lasting relationship with Dr. Wood's practice so my dog can have a better quality of life for however long or  short it may be.<//text>

<text>My allergic to many things rescue Shih Tzu mix has been seeing Dr. Woods since we adopted him in 2013.  We’ve been through a number of additional medical issues together including a torn ACL (repaired), dry eye and now vertigo.  I love that he has always presented the most conservative option first, that acupuncture and Chinese herbs are part of his expertise and treatment options and that he’s fully connected to the wider group of animal medical specialists in the area and perfectly willing to say “this has gone beyond me and I recommend you see....”. The staff has always been and continue to be friendly, kind and completely professional.  I’ve lived a lot of different places, had a number of different vets but never one I liked and respected more than Dr. Woods.</text><user_id>105767910059070234729</user_id><Gmap_id>0x80dd27f79eea405d:0x43f9127ccc9a2549</Gmap_id>< username>

<text>We have been going to Dr. Robert Woods for over 15 years.  He has seen us through many crises and issues.  He actually listens to you.  He treats each patient with the utmost caring and compassion.  We will never forget how kind he was when my mom had to put her older dog down and how much time he spent with her. Dr. Woods and his staff have gone above and beyond many countless times with their patience and caring.  We are very happy to have a vet with the knowledge and ability to mix eastern and western medicines to help our beloved dogs with whatever they need. He is one of a kind.<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><gmap_id>0x80dd27f79eea405d:0x43f9127ccc9a2549<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I couldn’t ask for a better vet. To start with the office staff was FABULOUS!!! I have a 6 year old wolf hybrid who was dealing with a horrible skin condition. After spending way to much money at our regular vet with no answers but suggestions for tons of tests, we walk in, meet the doctor and he diagnosed and treated him in one visit. Our dog is doing great and back to his happy self! Thank you so much Dr. Wood!</Review>

<rating>1</rating><review>Not happy at all. I took my cat there to confirm my suspicions that he had asthma. After about $500, xrays and blood work it was confirmed. The blood work didn't say anything, but the xrays showed it. I wanted to try a natural approach with some herbs. It didn't work. I tried many things, and it has gotten worse. I called to get a prescription for an inhaler to help him now. He needs it now. Instead I'm told I have to stress him out AGAIN to bring him back so they can tell me he has asthma again. I cant get there for at least 3 weeks, but they won't give me the help he needs. Instead they need to make sure they get their money from me for another office visit he doesn't need. Needless to say I will NEVER step foot in there again. Thanks for nothing. At least I know now what kind of vet they are early on. I'll take my kids, and money elsewhere.<//review>< pictures>

What a wonderful office! Last August I sought out alternative treatment for my senior dog who started having seizures. Two other vets ignored my main concern and suggestion of why his seizures were occurring (he had an eye that was puffed out). My first consultation with Dr. Woods was thorough and he listened carefully to all of my concerns and sure enough, my gut was right about his eye. Dr. Woods put together a comprehensive treatment plan for my dog and we have seen so much improvement with his seizures and a few other ailments. He also had a small surgery to remove a lump and it was carefully explained to me (I was super nervous for my dog!!!) and I was put at ease when my dog came bouncing out right after! The staff is great as well - they are always super friendly when I call to make appointments or with questions and to make Rx refills. They even call and follow-up when they say they will! I recommend Dr. Woods to anyone and everyone with a furry friend! On a side note, the office is super cute the way it's decorated, they have a huge selection of candy and coffee, and free toys to take home for your pet. I also love to follow their Instagram and daily puppy posts!< /text>

<text>Dr. Woods and his staff are great. I have taken my dog to many different veterinarians in search of a doctor who will work with him in extending his life and improving his quality of life and Dr. Woods has given me hope that I can help my dog. The best part is that my dog likes going to the practice. He usually shakes in terror every time I take him to the vet but at Dr. Wood's office he is curious and explores and is happy. That's the most important part.</text><GmapID>0x80dd27f79eea405d:0x43f9127ccc9a2549<//GmapID><rating>5</rating></record>

Honestly, I never write reviews but Dr. Woods and his team are amazing! I have never had a bad experience with either Dr. Woods or his staff. We have several pets with a multitude of issues and Dr. Woods has always been amazing. I can't blame their office  for being busy, since I am always referring people there! No matter what, they have always fit my animals into their busy schedule.<//Review>

<Review>Dr. Woods and his staff are the absolute best. He's been our veterinarian for over a decade and I love how he'll mix holistic and pharms to get the best result for whatever is going on. He's walked with us through some pretty serious stuff and has always been forthright and compassionate. He listens to our concerns and tailors any treatment to meet our abilities and needs (i.e., dog who won't tolerate pills so he finds the liquid version).  He isn't a sales guy - never pushes for extras - keeping procedures to just what's necessary. Engaging and kind, he's our vet for life.<//Review>< Pics>

We have ben using Dr Woods for my dog Chelsey for 4 yrs. Recently, we had her teeth cleaned and we knew she was in good hands.   It went very well and Julie called the next day to check up on Chelsey.   Great job!</Review>

I am very grateful to Dr. Woods and his excellent staff for their outstanding care of my dog and compassionate natures.  When my dog's cancer grew back after his surgery elsewhere, the Vitamin C IV treatments shrunk the tumor and provided better health for my dog.  I recommend them very highly!< /review>

<Review>I have three kitties who are being treated by Dr. Woods. One is being treated for cancer, both holistically and traditionally. In addition, she has had a number of acupuncture treatments. Another has diabetes. A third came to Dr. Woods as a survivor of a deadly infection and has recently had dental surgery, along with one of her "sisters". A fourth kitty has yet to visit Dr. Woods. Having had many pets over the years, I have spent a lot of time and money taking them to vets and specialty hospitals and I have never felt quite as good as I do having Dr. Woods as my pets' doctor. His "bedside" manner immediately puts both animals and people at ease. He truly listens to the animal lovers' concerns and I feel so fortunate to have found him when I did. He is well worth the extra miles that I travel to see him.<//Review>< pics>

Dr. Woods is an excellent vet, always willing to listen to owner's concerns and he always wants to do the very best,most efficacious treatment for the animal.He has genuine empathy for animals without being unrealistic about difficult situations.He offers solutions for many common problems that are nutritional and non-toxic. I have considerable education and experience in veterinary medical treatment and am not easily impressed by vets but  I am very favorably impressed by Dr. Woods and his staff.I come to him for almost all animal health issues I myself cannot easily resolve. Only the most mundane services are relegated to a more local vet center, which though quite good, is not the caliber of Dr. Woods. I would unreservedly recommend him to anyone seeking the best quality care for their pets.<//review>

<text>I have 2 dogs and I am so grateful to Dr. Woods for taking such great care of them over the past 6 years! One of my dogs has had several illnesses and Dr. Woods has been able to offer supplements and homeopathic remedies to help his body heal and I am certain he would not be as healthy as he is today if it were not for Dr. Woods' very knowledgeable advice. I may have several vets near where I live but I make the hour drive because there is no other veterinarian that I trust with my kids! Dr. Woods and his staff are always very kind and explain everything to me when I have questions. Thank you for all your wonderful care!</text>< pictures>

I've gone to Dr. Woods about 4-5 times now. His staff is courteous and professional. He is too. In the 8 years of having dogs I have to say I feel he is the most competent, well-rounded, and genuinely concerned Veterinarian whose services we have used. As an individual who extensively researches any thing and every thing I feel reassured in trusting his assessments. I think the veterinarian community would benefit by taking the sort of approach that he has taken, with the blending of traditional (age old methods), western (AMA backed approaches) and eastern (traditional chinese medicine) medicine. I would be very surprised if some one were to have a negative experience.</review>

<Text>I can't say enough good things about Dr Woods. We have been taking Tiffany the basset to Dr Woods for over a year and he is the best. and  We also had a Basset named ReRun and if it wasn't for Dr Woods she would not have lived to be 14 1/2 years young. The first time we brought her in she could hardly walk. With one acupuncture treatment she walked out with her tail in the air and smiling. After that one treatment she went every Wednesday for her acupuncture treatment and I think she looked forward to it since she always felt better when we left.<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures><userid>113415972778501186420</userid>< gmap_id>

<Review>My first appointment with Dr. Woods was with my cancer-stricken cat, Daphne.  After numerous trips to other vets, including an oncologist, I found Dr. Woods to be the most caring and sympathetic.  During Daphne's first acupuncture treatment, I expressed that I would like a picture of her, but had forgotten my camera.  He took one with his own phone and emailed it to me.   Daphne's cancer was an aggressive type, and her prognosis grim; however, the nutritional and immune supporting homeopathic remedies Dr. Woods prescribed seemed to make her feel better, and for a brief time she was more playful and energetic than I had seen in years.  When it came time for that final good-bye last July, there was no question in my mind who I wanted to help with that process, and I returned to Dr. Woods again.  A short time later, Dr. Woods office sent me a lovely card and some seeds which grew into a nice plant--a little reminder of my sweet Daphne.  I continued to see Dr. Woods with my younger cat, Precious, who had an unusual blood anomaly that had surfaced several years earlier in her first blood test, but had never been treated by the conventional vets I had seen previously.  Dr. Woods prescribed another homeopathic immune support remedy, and several months later Precious blood work came back normal.  Since then, she has been a healthy, active cat.  Last September I adopted a sleek black kitty who has kept Precious active with his boisterous manner and fanatical chase games.  I expect we'll all be back to see Dr. Woods office sometime later this year, and I look forward to introducing them to my new addition!</Review><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None</Resp>< GmapID>

I have had quite a few moves, so quite a few Doctors for my children. But now

"Wherever I go
Whatever I do
I will be right there"
going to Woods
"Whatever it takes"
depending on how far it'll take
"I will be right there" going to Woods

Dr. Woods & team are the best out there, hands down. And I cannot even stress that enough.< /Review>

Cant say enough wonderful things about Dr Woods. I have had veterinarians all over the country for my two boys, and he is one in a million. I never let anyone touch my babies but one of mine required surgery and everything went so smoothly and he healed so fast. I couldnt think of anyone I would trust more with my babies than Dr Woods! He is honest and always does what is in the best interest of the pet. His knowledge (from surgery to acupuncture!) and gentle spirit always put my two ferals at ease.<//Text>

I've been to more vets than I want to think about in my life and Dr. Woods has been my favorite. He saved my dog's leg with laser treatments when other vets had only given me the options of surgery that costs as much as a car or amputation (most vets quoted me considerably more on an amputation than Dr. Woods charged me for the laser treatments!).

I've also had very good experiences bringing my rats here. Dr. Woods was very kind and honest with me when I came in with no appointment and a dying rat. He was also great when another of my rats developed a very bizarre eye problem. He even went out of his way to research the weird looks-like-a-cataract-but-isn't thing my rat had.

All in all, I've loved every member of the staff and this review would become annoyingly long if I listed all the things they've done to make my day or my dog's day when I was making hard choices. They are so low-pressure and never make you feel like a crummy owner because you aren't rich. They loved all the critters I brought in, even though my dog is psycho and the rats are, well, rats. I love 'em but I know most people don't.</review>

<review>Dr. Woods, Hannah, Julie and the entire staff is the best!

Dr. Woods has seen us through allergies, kidney failure, arthritis, back pain and more. I love the holistic approach to my dog's health and know I can trust the recommendations of Dr. Woods. I never feel I am being pressured and know that they truly care about the health and happiness of my dogs. It is very hard to find a vet you can trust and who actually listens to your concerns and takes them into consideration when making recommendations but I am never disappointed.

I live in Mission Viejo and make the (sometimes weekly) drive to Dr. Woods because I believe in the care we receive. The staff is always helpful and friendly and they know my dogs! My old dog recently had to spend three days with Dr. Woods (which was very stressful for me and my dog) and I felt completely at ease knowing they would take amazing care of him. I would not think of going anywhere else!<//review>< pictures>

<Text>The staff in this office are the most uncaring bunch of people I've ever met! I've taken my cats to Dr. Woods over the last 8 years, spent LOTS of money and even referred Dr. Woods to friends. Consider ALL that o-v-e-r. It's really a shame because he's nice guy who knows a lot.

I called today asking if Dr. Woods could call me about an issue I'm having with one of my cats. I never ask this but it's a special circumstance. My cat has issues with being transported and before I brought him in, I wanted to get some advice. I'm sure my visit would've been upwards of $1,000 (it's rarely ever been less than that).

I tried to spare all the details with the front office and simply needed Dr. Woods' advice. Well, you know how when you're explaining something over the phone to someone and you can tell they just aren't listening? That's my experience with Heidi. I understand listening is an art and not everyone is good at it but whatever you do, don't expect it from Heidi. You're just setting yourself up for disappointment.

I was told by Heidi that Dr. Woods "Doesn't just call people." She informed me that it would be $75 for a phone call! I explained (though I shouldn't have to) that I was a long time customer who'd spent thousands of dollars there. I just had a special situation that I needed to discuss with Dr. Woods.

Heidi is just like Jasmine P. described in her review - Unfriendly, robotic and seems like she couldn't care less about you, your cat or about losing a customer. I asked Heidi to pretend she wasn't at work for minute and to imagine she was calling a vet for help about her cat. I asked her to have some compassion for a person who is distressed about her cat. Unfortunately, Heidi's compassion jar is empty (I'm not sure it was ever full).

In what I now believe was an effort to get me off the phone, Heidi tersely and reluctantly said she would have Dr. Woods call me. I couldn't help myself so I asked her, "Do you even care?" She evaded answering me and then repeated she would "have Dr. Woods call me." I pressed for an answer and with daggers in her voice said, "Of course I do!" I said, "Your behavior says otherwise." With that, she hung up in my face.

I called back and Julie answered. I asked if she could please tell Heidi nevermind and that I won't be coming back.

I should mention that this is the 3rd time I've been treated very poorly by the staff here. I'm a forgiving person and try to let things go but today was the last straw. These people are no better than you or I. However, they lack even the most granular amount of authentic kindness, empathy or compassion, which is an utter shame because Dr. Woods is a kind, caring, smart guy.

Heidi speaks in a whiny tone that's fake, condescending and devoid of humanness. If she worked for me, I would fire her. Unfortunately, her behavior is condoned and allowed to run rampant. And for that reason...I'm OUT.</Text>< Pics>

He is a true professional with a caring and thoughtful approach to my dog's health. My dog suffered from terrible skin allergies and wouldn't stop scratching. Dr. Woods gave him the appropriate alternative medicine using Chinese herbs and my dog's terrible skin problems have all but disappeared along with regular bathing. We also did a food allergy panel and found out that my dog is really allergic to wheat, corn, soy, and a few different types of meat. We adjusted his diet accordingly and that also really helped with his skin problems. If not for Dr. Woods we may not have gotten the problem solved. My dog was to the point where he would scratch deep cuts behind his ears, under his chin, etc. and Dr. Woods literally saved the day.

Dr. Wood's staff is also very caring and prompt. They've always called me back right away when I had a question. I had my dog neutered here in 2012 and I saw that he received the best care with Dr. Woods and staff. Dr. Woods also has thimerosal free rabies vaccines and Dr. Jean Dodds is right next door if you chose to get your dog a titer instead of vaccinating every year. I won't take my dog to any other vet!<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

I am so grateful for Dr. Woods. I have a westie which had a skin condition and after numerous trips to our previous vet and numerous medications I was referred to Dr. Woods. ONE visit and the skin condition did a 180 in one week with no meds! Which is really important to me... he was also able to determine some other underlining issues with our dog that I brought to our previous vets attention and it was just not looked into. My westie is now a different dog in a good way..she has more energy and her skin and fur are looking amazing. No more switching vets we are staying with Dr. Woods.<//Text>

<review>I have an 11 year old Golden Retriever who is also a Pet Therapy Dog. She had been having a great many hot spot issues and been on antibiotics 20 days a month for last 6 months. I was becoming increasing concerned but had used same vet for over 30 years when I met a lady in the store who told me about Dr. Woods. I took Maggy there and we tried a new approach to treat her from within which meant food change and supplements. A new symptom showed up so we changed the food to me cooking for her. By the time we were done with the pills she was acting like a much younger dog and her fur is so soft and hardly shedding at all. Both the staff and doctor have called to answer questions get updates and just generally showed concern for a dog they just met. I can not think of taking her anywhere else in order to have her with me for the longest time possible and have her this happy and feeling good.

Thank you so much.

<review>I had to bring my mother in law to the E.D. @ MSW on 6/7/21, and we had the best experience there. From the moment we walked in, the attention and care given my to my mother in law was phenomenal. Jason, RN triaged and checked her in, and was very concerned about her blood sugar being so high, so he got us right back and into an E.D. bed. Her nurse, Brianna, was amazingly kind, caring, patient, bubbly, had the best attitude, etc. I can't say enough good things about her.  Tara, from Radiology, who did her chest x-ray was amazing and kind, all the lab girls were very kind.  A young man in green scrubs was very attentive also. All staff were kind, caring and professional.  I knew when I had to leave that she would be in great hands. I'm very thankful for the E.D., Lab, and Radiology staff.<//review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

Thank you -GU"}< /resp><user>106499104307845604885<//user><text>Pros: The nursing staff at this hospital were phenomenal, from the pre-surgery to recovery to the night staff at the WCC. They came quickly when called and were very caring and good humored in general. They also explained things to me and walked me through what to expect or what was happening. They were sensitive to my needs, even the ones I didn’t know I had yet, and genuinely seemed to be happy to be caring for patients. Of course the surgeon was excellent and so was the anesthesiologist. They both came in and answered all of our questions and were very nice.

Cons: The food was absolutely vile and the food service was terrible. I have a dairy allergy, which was in my chart from the beginning and yet the food bringers served me cow milk and an omelette with cheese for my first meal in over a day. When they initially brought in my tray, I asked them to take away the milk and they asked if I would like a different milk which they never brought me, and they never mentioned the omelette with cheese, which I didn’t realize was there til after the food bringer left. Also on the tray were some breakfast potatoes which had no seasoning and tasted like they had been cooked in the microwave. How are people supposed to recover when they are being served garbage? It was enough to lower anyone’s spirit, but I was lucky that my partner was able to bring me real food later that morning. Furthermore, there were crosses in every room which can’t be taken down because they are nailed to the wall. It was very uncomfortable, I am not Christian and don’t appreciate that vibe being forced on me while I’m trying to recover. More than that, a chaplain came through and seemed to know things about me that were on my chart and that she had no business knowing.

All in all despite how excellent the nursing staff was, I would never come back to this hospital especially if I had to stay for more than a few hours. The food and the chaplains knowing health details is very much not worth it.<//text>< pics>

<Text>I spent 5 hours at this ER and they were the worst 5 hours of my life. I've never had an emergency but after this, I think I'll just let whatever tries to kill me do its job. There are no doctors in the ER and the nurses refused to give me a certain type of test because it "violated their morals"-- this is a Christian hospital, I was told after the fact, and unfortunately my issue was uterus-related thus I do highly feel this influenced the (awful) care I received. They gave me a pill without telling me what it was or what I was taking it for. The paperwork they gave me literally says "go see a doctor about this". The nurse said she gave me my test results but she only gave me results for 1 of 3 tests. Thanks for nothing, dips.</Text>< Pictures>

Hello- I was in today with a horrible stomach virus and I wasn’t able to thank my nurses but now that I’m home I’m feeling much better! I want to extend my sincere gratitude for all of the sweet nurses. I think my assigned nurse was KC (sorry I don’t recall) but they set up my IV quickly and administered medication promptly even though there were stroke patients and people much more ill than I! Thank you for all you do! I was able to spend the evening with my children in much less pain because of them. Thank you.< /Review>

< Review>
I was recently admitted to Mercy Hospital Southwest for a surgical procedure. Amidst the current healthy situation, I was pleased with the process leading up to said procedure. The staff was respectful, attentive, and cautious along the entire process. As well as giving concise explanations and elaborating on any questions given. I found the hospital itself to be very clean and provided plenty of health and sanitation products. Overall, I had as positive an experience as I could imagine at Mercy Hospital Southwest. Thank you to the staff as a whole.<//Review>

<text>The nurses are super busy with covid patients but my roommate and I needed assistance to get to the restroom and it took multiple calls to get someone to help us a few times. I would hate to think if we were having bigger issues and didn't receive help right away. Also, when I was discharged the nurse who helped me asked if I wanted to walk downstairs instead of being wheeled out. I just had surgery so no, I couldn't walk down and she also took every bump fast even after getting her I had surgery. Overall, it wasn't the best experience or the best nurses on duty.<//text><pics>None</pics>< Date>

My discharge papers show medications from some database that is outdated. I could tell because of all the medications they had listed only 2 were accurate. They left me a with a script that would interact with my current meds. I was there for extreme nausea and dehydration. Left in the waiting room. Never given fluids. And I was never physically examined. Nobody felt my abdomin to feel what the urgent care doctor felt that led him to send me to the ER. I've complained to the hospital and my insurance company. I'll fight it  as far as I can. I will never use a dignity medical facility again. And if my insurance doesn't come through, which we know they won't, I'll be switching from the most expensive insurance offered by the company to the cheapest, different company. I'm not paying to not receive treatment. I'd rather die at home at this point. And no, the pain has not gone away.</review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

<review>They have a mix of bad apples. The bad apple that stood out the most was the discharge lady by the name of Vida. She’s very rude, wants to kick you out without care in the world. She lied to us about insurance not covering home health aid so that’s why it wasn’t ordered. My sister who is a supervisor for case management hospitals in Los Angeles educated her on what was covered and how my mom should have continued treatment before discharging her. Vida has no place in healthcare, especially in the current position she’s in. Not once did she ask how my mom was doing, she just walked in and wrote on the white board and walked out as if we where her biggest bother in the world. As long as she’s there, I will never put my family in the care of this hospital.<//review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

One would think that someone coming in from emergency should be and would be aided. But no. Your response time is too slow, you have a single old nurse managing 10-30 people and more are on the way. Fix this. I wonder how many people have died waiting to be seen at your emergency entrance. This. Is. RIDICULOUS. Piss poor excuse for a medical facility<//Review>

Id like to thank everybody who helped my wife fight off this terrible virus, Covid19. And to the above and beyond support of the medical team. There's not way I can ever repay them except by giving a great review. So thats what this is, my best attempt to show my appreciation and gratitude. Thank you thank you thank you for saving my wife's life.
But at the same time I must, must let the people know about the unprofessional and blatantly irresponsible care of the male paramedic who drove my wife to the hospital. He was asking very personal questions giving his opinion as to why my wife should even go to the hospital for assistance, that he "doesn't even know why she's going they can't do anything for her". And fyi she was having complications with pneumonia and was experiencing severe breathing issues. She was given the oxygen tube under her nose but "he didn't know why it had not been turned on that it must have been unplugged". If i ever see this guy again he's going to need that ambulance, my wife came terribly close to succumbing to her illness. Thank God ❤☝🙏 for the medical team at the hospital of MERCY SOUTHWEST!!

My experience with Mercy  Southwest was a total knee replacement surgery. It was done during the Covid 19 epidemic, which had changed all the hospital's regular routines drastically.
The staff from pre-surgery to post surgery, be it nurse or Dr., was very professional. I would recommend this hospital to all of the patients I know.
I have had other procedures before, at other hospitals in the Bakersfield area and can definitely say without a doubt none of the other hospitals came close to the professional services I experienced at Mercy Southwest! A plus rating for sure!
I would like to say thank you to all of the staff involved in my surgery and recovery!</Review>

<review>Wow what a horrible place to be when your in pain or sick. The PA was so rude and her nasty attitude made it worse. Now I have to wait for a Doctor cause she crossed the line and I walked out. How do you guys hire someone so unprofessional? Now I'm thinking too Google a different emergency room. DONT COME HERE THEY REALLY ARE HORRIBLE.  I thought these are the people who our are heroes? After tonight I will never come here again. I'm almost thinking of leaving and dealing with this pain.<//review>< Pics>

<Text>Dignity health made me lose my dignity when I had to use the restroom while picking my mother up from the hospital.  They wouldn't let me use the restroom nor direct me to an alternative the gas stations in the area also had a no restrooms policy and nothing else was open. They couldn't even suggest a gas station in the area with an open bathroom so they caused an accident.<//Text>< pictures>

<text>I went to the Mercy Southwest emergency room today because I am pregnant and have been spotting for about a month. I was sent last month to be checked on and that experience wasn’t so bad, I felt they explained everything well and let me know the baby was fine and gave me some possible reasonings of why I was spotting. Fast forward to today where I am still spotting and it is worse than it normally is so I go back in to be checked and let them know I was returning for the same thing, just worse. I get everything done as far as my urine sample and blood work and go back for an ultrasound. The tech checked me for a bit to make sure to take a look at everything and finally turns the screen so I can see the baby, I didn’t hear the heartbeat but I could see a faint one on the monitor and the tech let me know that the baby barely moved which kind of worried me because I remember my last pregnancy my son was already moving a bunch this far along. So I go wait in the waiting room for my results. I get called and the doctor comes in and tells me the baby is fine and I asked if the tech mentioned about the baby not really moving and how the heart beat looked faint and if that’s okay and normal and she gets a condescending tone with me and says “probably because the baby is small?” With an attitude, and I said “the tech made it seem like there should be some movement and I remember my last pregnancy” and she stops me and continues with the tone and says rudely  “you’re early?” And at that point I could feel my eyes water..I go in wanting to make sure my baby is fine and she talked down to me for asking a question, I am a patient, I am not a doctor...she had awful bedside manners and made me feel like I shouldn’t have been there at all..I am thankful my baby is okay but I hope she doesn’t treat another worried mother the way she treated me, no comfort and no answers, that’s embarrassing.</text>< time>

This ER is a joke, they have no doctors just PA’s, the nurses are rude and unprofessional. The place is very
Disorganized. I went there for severe back injury and severe pain, all the pa wanted todo is giving me
Toradol injection. In the situation I was in, I needed strong anti inflation meds , and CT or MRI.
They seem not to care, they saw me crying from pain, yet they were taking their time, nurses are so lazy, and no doctor onsite.
This is a bad place to be w(en you need help.
I will tell all my friends and family not to go there.<//review>

<Review>One of the worst hospital experiences by far, and not because of the medical staff. The nurses and doctors have always been nice to us. I was scheduled for a c-section today! I went in on Monday to admitting to do pre-op paperwork, and they sprung on us that we had to pay a $1400 deposit or I'm not allowed to have my c-section there. The admitting was nice, she told me to contact Enrique Camacho to see if there was anything to work out. I'm already stressed out about having this surgery.
I contacted Enrique Camacho regretfully!! He was sooo rude! I told him we didn't have $1400 with only 2 days notice, and he said the only thing to do was cancel our c-section. He told me I must be behind in my doctor bills! That's none of his business!! He was not budging or willing to work with us.
I called my insurance company after, and they said for maternity that's not how it's supposed to work, and the hospital hadn't even filed a claim with my insurance company in order to say what we owe in the first place. They told us not to give any money. While I was on the phone my husband called the hospital to complain and was told they would investigate it.. At that same time I had to call my doc to cancel my c-section 😡😡.
I guess with my husband calling to complain Enrique called us back still trying to collect money but he was willing to take less money. He said if we don't pay anything we don't get the c-section. I asked him 3 times just to make sure.
Finally around 3pm we received a phone call from the hospital. I didn't get her name, but she apologized for the whole incident. She was really sweet and nice to us. She told us for maternity surgeries they are not allowed in any way to deny services for financial reasons. I told her that's not what Enrique said,  and she apologized again. That is not hospital protocol for maternity.. She told me I can still have the c-section today if I wanted. I got in contact with my doc, and we decided just cancel the c-section. I'm having this for medical reasons not out of convenience! Thank God my baby is healthy, but what if she wasn't. I have a seizure disorder which is why I'm having a c-section! I was really disappointed yesterday, and that could have been time spent with my husband and son instead of fighting over the phone about money with some stranger. Now I have wait one more week for the surgery which means less time for my husband to spend with his newborn!!< /Review><resp>None< /resp>< userid>

<Text>Lazy staff was just sitting when I walked in. I got  the hand to wait, then they continued to sit and work for a couple minutes before even asking me why I was there. I had to clap to get their attention down the way, like is this an EMERGENCY room? Everything pretty much continued in that way. As if they were being inconvenienced to work.< /Text>< username>

Honestly, I’d give no stars if I could. Mercy southwest has very very poor medical practice. Been sitting in this waiting room for an hour, was sent here from urgent care because my medical needs weren’t able to be met with their setup. Was told I’d be given pain medicine to help alleviate me, yet the whole hour I’ve been here I haven’t been given a damn thing. I feel awful. I told them how awful I feel. And still nothing. The hospital is a joke. They have no care or concern for anyone.<//Review>

We arrived 10 minutes early. I told both of the ladies that were signing patients in that we had an In Quicker appointment at different times to make sure they knew. As we sat for 20 minutes listening to them to call other patients to register. Did they all have In Quicker appointments? I used InQuicker here a couple of years ago and there was no waiting at all. Not today. After registering my friend the woman told her they would call her to the back sometime soon. She reminded her she had an appointment. No comment.
When you make an appointment with In Quicker a nurse calls you on the phone. The nurse told her she needed to come in right away for the problem she had.
We are still sitting waiting after 45 minutes more. I figure we might move faster than someone who just came in to be seen. Maybe not. I’m thinking the In Quicker app is useless. I won’t come here again.

Mercy southwest, I don’t need your comment below where you offer further assistance because we didn’t have a great time in your ER.</text>< Pictures>

The pandemic restrictions made it impossible. for my siblings and me to sit with our mother once we learned that she was transferred. (She has Alzheimer’s. and we all live a couple of hours away. She was picked up at the Rosewood SNF and taken to your ER where she sat alone for 10+ hours before she was placed in an er bed and sedated. I don’t believe her daily regiment of medication was given to her. And it is my understanding that Ativan did little to alleviate her anxiety.

My sister called er and then mom’s nurses station for rm 2135.  She was told that she would receive a call back, but that call never came.  So we were never given any pertinent information. What care was she given? What meds?  We have no idea. Unfortunately, we could not drive up to sit with her and we get that the staff was busy. But in forty eight hours all we were able to ascertain was that she did not have a room; then 24+ hours later she had a room; and then she’d been returned to Rosewood.  Our frustration should be evident.

We sat for nearly two days trying to find out what was being done for our mother. Your staff left us deeply concerned about her well being.  To say we are angry and disappointed would be an understatement.</text>

<text>My wife was sent to the ER with a possible blood clot. 6 hours of waiting left us with no answers. The “security” is rude, the nurses are not caring and the dissemination of information from Doctors to patients is non existent. To top it all off, we had to pay our 75 dollar deductible for this horrible service.<//text><user>117447297368904070675<//user>< Pics>

Specialists will only see those with insurance. So if you have a condition that may need extra attention, “go elsewhere” is what we were told. Which is a inhumane if you ask me. You go to a hospital to be treated. At least we thought...
They also take hours to receive medicine from nurses. Our doctor checked on us more times than the nurses did.<//review>

Here at the emergency room with my granddaughter who is in tremendous pain (believe it is appendicitis). Place is packed when a mommy with a 2or 3 year old came in. She was filling out the paper to put in the basket and to wait like the rest of us, but must have called her friend that I thought was a nurse, but was told it was a Dr. Though she filled it out and put it in the basket, her friend the "Dr." took them straight back. This child showed no distress, no coughing, sneezing, nothing. Child was wide eyed and went right into the Dr. friends arms and continued to just look around, showing zero symptoms.

First of all...the staff/nurses are great. But unfortunately i felt ignored when i talked to the dr. Sadly i had to go get better care else where...at an urgent care facility.
This is not the first time ive been ignored by the dr.
I had an absec that i had returned there 3 times and on the third time the Dr stuck my really hard with a long needle twice ans asked if i could feel anything...i told him yes and he proceeded to cut with the scalpel...i was screaming in agony...after he cut he started to press really hard to get everything out.
I feel ignored evertime im there and i dont think they should treat people like this.
And id give a minus star if i could.<//review>

<Resp>{'time': 1561407001923, 'text': 'Thank you for the kind words, JoAnna!'}</Resp><Pictures>None<//Pictures><review>A lot of the negative reviews are either 1) non emergencies that cause longer wait times 2)complaining about wait times 3) people who don’t understand the rules of triage 4) people who don’t realize that the ambulance is bringing in people while you wait who may be worse than you. Seriously, some of what people are complaining about can be taken care of by your pcp OR urgent care. You are wasting ER time and then complaining about wait times caused by people like you.

This hospital may not be perfect, but it is run by humans. Are you perfect? No. No one is. Hence, the mistakes made are because humans make mistakes.

Advocate for yourself instead of sitting there scowling and holding it in. If you don’t like the nurse, ask for a different nurse instead of sitting there shocked and upset. Don’t like the doctor? Do the same. Don’t like the hospital? We have plenty in town to choose from. Don’t have an emergency or good insurance? Go to a clinic or doctor instead of the ER. Use some common sense people.

Every time I have come here, I haven’t had any issues. If I have, I bring it up and it gets resolved.<//review><Date>1561263857886<//Date><rating>5</rating>< gmap_id>

<text>Went in with a knee injury. They did an X-ray and refused to do an MRI even though I told her it's not a bone issue. After a few hours the results came in and as I expected Nothing came up. she refused to do an MRI , said I was fine and sent me limping away with no brace or any treatment plan . Just told me to go see my PCP . INCOMPETENT AND RUDE . Also watched them call a lady's name who was very out of it for hours before they FINALLY came out to check her bracelet and realized it was her.

UPDATE: It wasn't just a sprain. I have a bunch of ripped cartilage in my knee.<//text><Response>{'time': 1555627589062, 'text': "Hello Rosie,\n\nWe're sorry for your negative experience in our hospital.

My wife recently had a c-section with no complications.  After being discharged they called her to find out how she and the baby were doing. Most of the nurses were sensitive to my wife’s pain and they tried hard to make her feel confortable as she was healing.  We are providing feedback on the one nurse who should be retrained or couch to be more sensitive and careful as performing certain procedures.  This is our second c-section baby at this hospital and we appreciate their efforts to providing compassionate care.< /text>

I went in threw emergency room.
A can of roach fogger exploded in my face. As ND I swallowed a huge amount of spray I stop breathing in seconds and I broke out in a watery sweat and water pouring out of my eyes and foam out of my mouth. I did panic and made it worse. My sis call 911 I couldn't breath my throat got so tight and I just kept trying to get what ever little air I could, after a few minutes I found a spot and got a little air in but I had to concentrate to keep it going and by the time helped arrived I was getting little air down my throat. I had vomited right before they showed up and I was standing up to scared to move. I felt like I was during that day.
The parmeddics were so nice I felt like I didn't want to boughter them that they didn't need to pick me up..
But they convince to go in and get seen. All the while I was still have I g a very had time breathing my tight won't listen up. They gave me breathing treatment and buy them time we arrived at mery Southwest hospital I was feeling so much better. I just like the fact that they cared they really cared about me and what just had happen to me.
The staff at Mercy Southwest are so busy but you can see that they work very well all together it was peaceful in that place. I watched how they all just going with the flow and oh my God let me tell all of Bakersfield that hospital smelled so fresh that means alot to me.. a hospital that smells fresh is rare. It was so clean and I was feeling way better and I just was looking at how that ace made me feel at home and that security I felt was real. I love Mercy Southwest I really thank every nice smile gentsl touch and respect I felt I appreciated all who help me that evening. God bless all of you for caring and giving me the compassion I have not seen in a while. Your angels ... By by Fernanda Pires,, I write in full respect.
I read some of the reviews people wrote.
Let me say something and bring reality to the surface.
The staff are so busy and they work so hard and when you go in you go in for help but there are people ahead of you already there. The staff does there best to get to you and treat your problem as fast as they can but consider each person has there's own emergency that they are dealing with and give them more respect because that is hard work.
If you can see truely see what they are up against from the time they start work to the end of there shift and many work over time to care for us in need, 8t would blow your mind and you would compassion for them. No o e is being rude or intending to be mean they do there best they are human as you and they are not perfect but what would happen if we didn't have them and if that hospital it not for you then go some where else and more of us can get treated willingly by the best hospital in Bakersfield Cal. Mercy Southwest is the nicest , cleanest, respectful to there patients... Open your eyes to reality ...</Text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Review>I have used this hospital/urgent care on many occasions. The ER does take quite a bit of time, but the time after time the staff has been more than accommodating and pleasant. In 2012, I gave birth to my first child in the birthing unit and I was so pleased with how comfortable they tried to make me feel. The nursing staff that started out with me at 11:00 p.m. asked their supervisor to stay until 7:00 p.m. the next day to help me finish! I felt so important and the room accommodation for birth are very nice. This coming year I will be giving birth to my second child and I am really happy to have the ability to go back.to this hospital at a reasonable cost and look forward to it! I have heard from others that this hospital wasn't the best for birthing, but I bet to differ. My personal experience was amazing!!!</Review><pictures>None</pictures><response>None< /response><GmapID>0x80ea43de87a4db2f:0x383e076dcab0d3e0</GmapID></record>

Stay away from this place. Rude staff and they are price gouging specialists. Huge fees just to walk through the door and see a doctor (hospital fees) then it just gets worse from there. They will not discuss any pricing or rates before treatment - because they plan on fleecing you. They love to get your insurance info, then get you treated by an out of network doctor. Stay away from this racket.<//Review>

I can't thank MSH enough for the great care they took of my wife and pre-term twins. All of the nurses in the birthing center were so kind, sympathetic, and hospitable. The nurses in the NICU treated our boys so well.  You can tell they love what they do and they're great at what they do! I tried to get all of their names but I can't remember all of them. The ones I do remember are: Nurse Cheryl, Lorena, Nelia, Denise, Tonya, Emily, Julieta, Mylene, Darlene, and Melissa. Those are just a few. The lactation consultants, the nurses who took care before she gave birth and after she gave birth were just outstanding! Forever grateful to them. Thank you MSH!<//Review>

<Text>After seeing all the bad reviews for the hospital, I felt compelled to write one of my own to try and offer a little balance. 2 weeks ago today, my wife had our son at the birthing center and from the moment she was seen for "just not feeling good" to the moment we walked out of the facility a little more than 48 hours later, us and our visiting family were all very happy and impressed with the level of care we received.
First off, I have to give a huge shout out to Hannah, Heather, and Rachel in the birthing unit. They were the nurses who took care of my wife and I during labor induction and delivery. I have a new respect for nurses and all they do for their patients. Hannah was quick to answer all of my wife and I's questions when she was being evaluated, prior to being admitted. Heather worked tirelessly through the night to not only keep my wife as comfortable as possible, but she also took lots of time to answer our never ending stream of "first time parent" questions. And Rachel's shift started right as the birthday party was really getting started and her friendliness and calm demeanor made her feel like a friend that had been hanging out with us all night.  The real icing on the cake was when she would look at our baby compliment him with enough honesty to make us believe that he was one-of-a-kind in her eyes as much as ours.
It was truly an enjoyable experience and we look forward to returning there with our second child and hopefully seeing familiar friends.</Text>< Rating>

Didn’t let me stay to push my friend in her wheel chair. I expressed that I’ve been pushing her since no one else will and they said they’ll take care of her. They didn’t push her and she got up and walked in after knee surgery bleeding out.</text>

Worse hospital in town! Bad visits for all 3 of my daughters. One daughter needed her appendix removed, they had to transfer her out. Other daughter got her leg ran over and was brought by ambulance. Staff only concern was she did not smoke on hospital premises. They were sending her home with IV still in her arm and hospital gown still on. The security guard noticed the IV and a nurse came out to the waiting room to remove it. Then no help getting my daughter loaded to leave they only came out to make sure I didn't take the wheel chair with me. Now my other daughter needs surgery on her finger after cutting it today. They keep changing their story and nothing but a run around and waiting. Bunch of incompetents work here!</Review>

Terrible hospital. My mother has now been there for two days and has not seen a doctor. The doctors are refusing to see her because she has Medicaid due to recently being laid off her job. She is diabetic and was refused food for almost 24 hours. We will be seeking legal counsel</text>

Went into labor everything was great tell I got the night nurse I was able to get patocin to ease my labor pains tell I got the night nurse and when I asked for it she denied getting me another dose when I was told I could get up to 6 doses. She insisted I get epidural even though I didn't want it and kept pushing for me to get it when I told her I'd get it she got the biggest smile once she brought the papers and I started reading them and told her I wasn't sure she started to scream at me and it being my first born it was a scary experience and she wasn't much help. After I got the epidural I didn't see her again tell morning when she was about to leave I told her I felt the baby coming but she told me no it's your first you won't deliver for at least another 2 hours and she didn't bother to check me. Once the other nurse came in and checked me it was already time to push and he was out with in 8 minutes of pushing.< /Text>

Terrible hospital. My mother has now been there for two days and has not seen a doctor. The doctors are refusing to see her because she has Medicaid due to recently being laid off her job. She is diabetic and was refused food for almost 24 hours. We will be seeking legal counsel</Review>

Worse hospital in Bakersfield!!  Been here since five p.m.  and they have not called one single patient to the back!
We ask when will be called and every hour we are first person in line then second person in line then third person. How is it that every hour they make u wait even longer?!?! And two patients have left!!!  Cussing out the nurses why it's taken hours and hours to be called!!!  Never go to Mercy Southwest!!!

<review>I was admitted to the ER because my water broke. As soon as I walked in I was immediately attended to! The staff were great. Very helpful. I had an emergency Csection, the nurses were nice & made me feel very comfortable. The anesthesiologist was amazing! He did a great job with my spinal block! I spent 3 days there, my pain management was great. The nurses were on top of their game! They took very good care of my daughter & I. I would recommend this hospital to anyone, I will be having any future children here as well :)< /review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

<Text>So sad to see so many bad reviews here. I experienced only amazing service during my trip to the ER. They suspected I was having a stroke (thank goodness it turned out to be a much less serious problem) and took me right in. Every person I dealt with, doctor, physician assistant, nurse, techs, admitting, student EMT was incredibly kind and professional. I did spend several hours there, but the ER was packed and it takes time to run the many tests that they did to thoroughly check me out and diagnose my problem. I hope I never need to go to the ER again, but if I do, this is definitely the place I would go.</Text><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmap_id>

I absolutely love and MISS the birth center. I wish and want to go back lol, I felt so at home and pampered. The nurse the helped deliver my baby who was with me through out most of my pain was my favorite and I would like to thank her some day. I loved all of my nurses so sweet and kind. This was a great experience to have for giving birth for my first time. I recommend!<//text>

<review>The receptionist doesn't know what is going on. I called multiple times to get forwarded to an orthodontist. I was placed into a phone tree that had an infinite loop, which makes first year recursion programmers look like Alan Turring.

<review>My mom has an extensive cardiovascular history and was complaining of severe epigastric pain which was unrelieved by antacids. I told her it could be her heart. Her Blood pressure was in the 170s and She took nitroglycerin WITH RELIEF. she then went to the ER. It took them 40 mins to get an ECG and more than an hour to get blood tests. She was finally seen by someone 2 hours after she got there. A nurse apparently came by to give her a GI cocktail. My mom asked why when they never examined her and she didn’t have Epigastric pain anymore. My mom then told the nurse that she had a sudden onset severe headache and if they could take her blood pressure. The nurse REFUSED. My sister, who is an ER nurse called their supervisor and/or charge nurse. She finally got a hold of one who was very aggressive then said they only had 1 triage nurse. My sister told them she didn’t expect them to drop everything but to at least give our mom a fair assessment and that any nurse can triage if they need more help. The nurse then said ‘she doesn’t have orders for GI cocktail’. My sister told them that she was on the phone with my mom and heard it being offered to her. They finally took her BP. It was 178/112. They offered her TYLENOL. She was eventually(an hour later) seen by a doctor and was prescribed with Hydralazine and potassium.  They then discharged her. My mother then read her discharge orders. Her K+ level was 3.1. The education part had potassium supplement but she had no prescription. She called them for it and was told by the charge nurse that ‘they don’t treat hypokalemia if it’s just 3.1’. Which is against what the doctor had said. My sister called again and got a hold of the charge nurse who told her that they don’t treat hypokalemia if she was asymptomatic(I don’t know what their policy is but a potassium of 3.1 in the hospital I work for definitely gets treated). My sister told them my mother was symptomatic and listed all my mother’s symptoms. The charge nurse then backtracked and said she couldn’t open the chart and that our mom has to call. My mom did call and she can get her prescription later today.

They didn’t do an assessment. They didn’t get any imaging done. They doctors and nurses weren’t on the same page. And she was offered medications that weren’t ‘ordered’. We are a family of nurses. We know incompetence and negligence when we see or hear it. Worse part is that my mom works for Mercy hospital. This is not okay and my mom should have received better care.<//review></record></dataset><record>

<text>24 hours after being misdiagnosed at accelerated urgent care on Calloway and Olive, I rushed my wife to the ER trauma center at Mercy Medical Southwest.

The team of doctor’s at the time were timely, prudent, and knowledgeable despite never having a patient with an illness like my wife had. Within minutes after check-in, she was hurried into trauma and had her blood drawn for testing.

My wife is very frail and has had 23 major reconstructive bone, joint and muscular surgeries, and her veins are small and difficult to find. She has always had antibiotics, steroids and pain medication administered via needle through the top of her hands. The ER technician was authorized to use a 24 gauge needle for blood drawing, blood and culture samples and even for her CT scan of the face, brain, entire head and neck.

With no holds barred, the team worked tirelessly to fight the infection that was spreading quicker than encapsulated antibiotics could fight during the day prior. Her infection, 2 days later is now controlled and subsiding with the right prescriptions. I’m grateful for the team of doctor’s, nurses and ER techs for literally saving my wife’s life.

The chief surgeon told us if we had waited more than 6-8 hours longer to bring her in, she would’ve been completely blind in her right eye, deaf in her left ear, and the infection would have spread past her retinal and damaged her brain to an unknown extent. Thanks to all the staff for saving my wife’s life!!

You are the healing angels that are more ridiculed than thanked and I am grateful for each one of you.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

<review>People wonder why insurance has gone up so much, I have my own reasoning.  Obama care is one reason, and the medical institute.  I spent just a little over 4 hours having a procedure in Mercy Southwest Hospital, my medical bill was over 36000.00 and that's not including the anesthesiologist and doctor.  The care there was great, but not worth the cost!  Although I do have have medical insurance, which paid most of bill, I called and asked if I paid in full the remaining balance if they could give me a discount, I was told no, that the only discounts given were to patients that didn't have medical insurance!  I thought with this new Obama Care program everyone was to have medical insurance, which seems so unfair, I pay for my medical insurance and Obama Care is free in most cases!</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Time>

If I could leave a 0 star review I would.   I went into the main entrance and the hospital is supposed to give out a list of the Physicians that they have there and their own business which is strange because as a patient anywhere prior to admission they have to inform you totally... this hospital so horrible they're just like Memorial Hospital they like killing babies<//Text>

Great hospital. Emergency room was quick to admit my grandmother who had broken her hip. She was given excellent care and had the required surgery the very next day (which happened to be a Sunday!).

Every employee, whether it be a doctor, nurse, or desk attendant was very helpful and friendly. They always knew how to answer any questions I had.

If you're sick or hurt in the Kern county area, don't be afraid to visit Mercy. I rarely do reviews but I think this hospital deserves one.</Text>

I was in the hospital for a month.  It was a long drawn out process, but they saved my life.  I cannot say enough good about the care I received and how patient the nursing staff was with me.  Even the dietary did everything possible to find something I could tolerate.  All in all, it was a very positive experience... considering it was a hospital.  Thank you very much!!!< /text>

Water broke so I was induced for labor but wasn't dilating. They left me in labor for 40 hours. I got an infection and went completely septic with my baby still inside of me. My organs started shutting down. They finally performed an emergency c-section. Baby and I almost died. It haunts my nightmares.< /review>

I was seen in March for a cut on my foot. Lets start in chronological order. I arrived around midnight and forgot my wallet. My foot was wrapped in a washcloth...thats it. As I sat with my boyfriend in an empty waiting room they would call me back for random things. It seemed like they were keeping in the waiting room instead of helping me like a normal patient. I got x-rays done pretty fast but it took them three hours to then get me to a room to look at my foot.....

They proceeded to take the washcloth off in order to clean the cut.....let me remind you this is 4 hours after arriving at an empty emergency room. That's when the nurse saw I was going to need stitches.

You would think they would look at the cut when they took my vitals and asked me why I was there. I even brought the nail I stepped on!

Then the doctor came in who was very rude. A blind woman. She was verbally rude and very hard on me to the point my boyfriend stood up and told her to ease off.

So I get stitched up and they send me on my way. The lady who does the discharge papers told me to call back in 30 days to apply my insurance. Nothing else.

My accountant called and emailed to get my insurance applied. Last we knew we emailed the insurance card and it was taken care of.

PRESENT DAY
I keep getting calls frm mercy because i have a $1600 bill. So i call the number on my bill after a lot of phone calls I am told the issue is mercy hospitals won't accept insurance after that first 30 days. I asked the guy on the phone exactly this "so you're telling me that after those 30 days it's just pointless to have insurance?" He  said I was correct but if I can prove the hospital didn't inform me i can move forward with the dispute.

I get a call an hour ago that my insurance was submitted on time but to the wrong billing department. They have two but have nothing to do with each other. Furthermore they don't tell you that and they don't communicate with each other. So here is the best part....because of employees failing to communicate or inform patients, I am told there is nothing they can do. That i am left paying a bill that my insurance was not applied to because the hospital can't get their stuff together...<//Text>

<text>Went just to VISIT a family member that was being seen here. In the time it took us to get someone to see if we could go in, we watched a man come in bleeding from the arm. They didn't immediately take him into a room and they didn't even bother to clean up the blood that was pooling on the floor. Someone else (I believe his friend or wife or something) eventually grabbed some paper towels and wiped up the blood, but the staff never cleaned it up.

The ER corridor (because it's not a waiting room, it's a hallway with some chairs and a vacant check-in desk) was completely over-packed with disorganised staff running around with no direction. We asked several times if we could see our family and got brushed off. We were told security was needed if we wanted to see them at one point. After roughly 20 minutes, we were able to finally get someone who let us in 2 at a time.

By far, the worst ER I've ever been in and some of the worst, most unorganized staff I've had the mispleasure of dealing with. Don't go here if you have a medical emergency. It's not worth it, they don't care here.<//text><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None</resp>< GmapID>

Well when the OB/GYN was doing the procedure to clean everything out, she decided to to look at me in the eyes and said, "this is the closest to child birth you'll have."

How pathetic and sick can you be to say something like that to someone that just had a miscarriage?< /text>< pictures>

<Rating>1<//Rating><text>I came in from a car accident and let me put it this way. I had lunch right before the accident and my mom had to leave me with my BF to get a late dinner ready which was cold by the time I got home. All we needed was to know if I had internal bleeding with Urgent Care being so concerned about organ damage and a concussion they asked me repeatedly if I was sure I didn't want an ambulance for the one mile drive which I didn't plan on driving myself. I also had to tell the nurses every time they made me sit down and stand up which I told them the motion was painful that I was there for a car accident and had to show them the bruising that made their eyes go wide every time. And it still took 9 hours! And they didn't even scan my head, just treated the nausea that was a sign I might have head damage. Thankfully, that wasn't the case but they didn't even check my scalp for wounds.

Two weeks later I have a $6000 bill with only $1000 of it explained in the breakdown of the bill. On top of that they gave me one of the medications without telling me what it was for. My checkup from the visit I had a week later had to be the one to tell me they found a kidney infection and that's what the antibiotics were for! Didn't inform me, just handed me the form to get it and said I wouldn't have to stay overnight after all that time where by that point I was in tears from fear and pain in a wheelchair so uncomfortable it was counter-protective in preventing the pain which was worst the 10 times I had to stand and walk for one test and then had to walk back. BTW, I told them was an 8, mostly because I didn't want to be viewed as exaggerating by saying it was a 9 or 10, but apparently even with the nasty bruising they doubted me with not even giving me pain killers where Urgent Care tried to give me something so strong it had to be delivered in a shot in my rear or I might overdose.

They also didn't care the next day when I learned I was breaking out into hives from the anti-nausea medication and instead of wanting me to come in and make sure it was something in that or changing the prescription, I could hear how little the nurse cared as she told me to get over it and just stop taking it. What if I, just a simple patient, had been wrong and it was the antibiotics? I couldn't just stop those!It all felt very unprofessional and like they just wanted my money.<//text><Gmap_id>0x80ea43de87a4db2f:0x383e076dcab0d3e0< /Gmap_id><resp>None<//resp><name>Rebeccah Watson<//name>< pics>

I don't think I have ever been more disappointed in an emergency room. My daughter went in being severely dehydrated from the flu. They had a nurse come in and put in 2 IVs and did a horrible job placing them. One was only half way in and causing her pain in the arm. Not only was she feeling horrible but was treated with such disregard. The blood draw they did on her sat in a syringe for over 30 minutes on the counter in the room. The lab had to do another draw on her through her hand. Not only was she dehydrated she had a UTI and they didn't tell her upon discharging. It wasn't until she went for a follow up with her primary Dr. did she find out. And that was because my daughter took her the emergency room paperwork and Lab report. So no antibiotics to treat her UTI until 3 days later. How she handled the pain is beyond me. That night the emergency room staff gets a big fat F in my book.< /Text>

Took my husband to the ER one Sunday morning for SOB and some chest pain. Thinking he may have pneumonia. The front staff took him back for more info right away. I thought "WOW! What a great hospital!" Considering we had never needed to go to the ER before. Well it was 7 hrs later before we were called back to a room. Had my kids with me. A new born and a 8 yr old who were getting inpatient as well as the patient. We ended up leaving and seeing a doctor a few days layer to find out he has valley fever. No one ever checked to see if we needed anything while waiting. No update of how much longer. NOTHING! absolutely poor communication. We will not go back to this hospital again. It's a shame.< /text>

I was here in the ER last night due to my son having an allergic reaction to idk what...from there we expected to wait several hours. But luckily we got seen right away! The service was so quick from the sign in to getting discharge. The night shifts was amazing including all the nurses, registration nurse, discharge nurse to the doctor. Everyone was just so quick and thorough and the nurses and the doctor explained everything they do! The left me with no questions to ask.

Well I am writing another review for today.I had to come back again because his allergic reaction got worse...face swollen and itchiness and redness everywhere.< /review>

Not the place to attempt a natural birth unless you want nurses who yell in your face to get in bed or your baby will fall out and die. Dr. Park was so terrible and gave up on me when I wanted to be upright to push my baby out. He literally threw up his hands and sulked on the other side of the delivery room. He was so rough and almost missed catching her because he had to run back over. He never introduced himself and he and his staff kept telling me I wasn't "allowed" to be upright as I delivered.</Text>

was brought by ambulance with stroke signs and they put me in the lobby and kept shuffling me down the list sat in the er lobby for over 10 hours, thankfully I didn't have stroke bc if I had I would probably be dead or something. was finally discharged with a few prescriptions took the scripts in to a pharmacy and the doc numbers were to a non existent doc, so pharmacy thinks I had a fake. took it back to the er and now they want to down grade the script to something I told them doesn't work on me. This er/urgent care used to be great but now it's horrible. will not be coming back< /text>

9+ hour wait for the ER. No sense of urgency for an actual emergency. There is no difference to the staff between someone on their deathbed and a drug addict looking for an rx.</review>

I took my daughter in for severe stomach pains, after an 2 hours of process we went to get X-rays, but while we were there another nurse called my daughter, since we were not in the waiting area to respond they closed the case. We were only up in X-ray for 30 minutes. When we came back after 3 hours of waiting to be called again I asked the nurse what was the hold up, they let me know they closed the case because I didnt respond.

Review is for the ER visit....
Had to come visit the ER for some intense Stomach and Chest pain and as soon as I got there I had test run such as EKG, Blood work and X-Ray but had to wait over 7 HOURS in this cramped up small waiting room just to get a room for a doctor can see me. If u need a quick ER visit ur better off going to memorial 34th st or SJVC on Chester< /Text>

I took my infant to ER and the service was great, however, the major issue was that the lady who completed registration took my debit card to process a $30 co-payment and photo copied my debit card without me knowing and then paid her PG&E and direct tv bills the next day with my card!!! She came to my room where my daughter and I were receiving medical aid and took my card with her then returned with a receipt. DONT HAND ANYBODY THERE YOUR CREDIT CARD .< /text>

I have been to the emergency room twice here, both times I sat in the waiting room longer than I ever spent with any type of healthcare provider. ABSOLUTE RIP OFF, I had a MRI done and was charged over $4000.00 I called around after receiving my bill and found that one of the best hospitals in the state (Scripps La Jolla) would have charged somewhere around 1/4 of this price. When I called to dispute the charge I got a phone operator that said "it is what it is", I will never go there for emergency services again.</Text>

Me and my girlfriend have been waiting in the ER for over 9 hours in severe pain and nausea from a bacterial infection in her face "caused by her dentist" and after being thrown around from kaiser and back too the dentist for the last 8 days getting pumped with antibiotics they recommended coming here and being admitted. Absolutely the worst idea possible.<//Review>

It is ridiculous when you are made to wait 7 hours in a waiting room when you are in pain! When someone tries to call and make an appointment and are told abdominal pain is an emergency so just bring her in and then when they get there she is made to wait sitting in the waiting room for 7 hours. Medical care in Bakersfield is an absolute joke! If I ran my business like they run their hospitals I would be out of business! It's really sad!</Text>

<review>In January I was having heart attack symptoms. My husband drove me to mercy southwest because they were closest to us. The staff was kind and   I was seen quickly. My complaint is about the billing. I was told I was to be admitted. According to my insurance. If you are admitted you do not have to pay for the ER copay.  I was responsible for the deductible of 300.00. Ok that's understandable. So I get a bill for $400. I called my insurance and they said it must be the extra $100 for copay.  I was told to notify them that there isn't one due to being admitted. So imagine my surprise when I'm told it isn't for a copay, but for a OBSERVATION fee. Really! I was stuck in the ER for hours, due to no bed being available. I was finally moved to a small exam room still in the ER after being there for 12 hours.
Observation? I didn't see anyone for hours. Trying to get someone to come and undo my hookups took forever. I usually waited 20 min or more each time I pressed the call button to go to the bathroom.With an IV
hooked up, when you need to go......again I understand. You're in the ER. They have urgent people to attend to. the staff was very nice. Just extremely busy. Observation fee? Must be another way to collect more money. Btw I have put in a dispute claim. Still waiting to hear from them.<//review><pics>None</pics>< resp>

There is so much I can truly say about Mercy SW.  I have Crohn's disease, and was diagnosed with it 1 month prior to my admission at mercy S-W. I went In and admitted myself in there ER early morning. The wait wasn't so bad but my pain and fever was rising. Once back in the ER, the nurses took to me right away, the ER dr gave a plan of action immediately and reached out to my GI specialist for care and test procedures. Within 30 mins in the ER, I received blood tests and cultures. They did the IV, which was the best IV experience I've ever had, and they had my results for blood back stat. The dr was so on top of it, had me on treatment for C. Diff and continued my Crohn's treatment. The nurses, Dr, and the vampire was great. Everybody is so calm, happy, and understanding. Once moved to a room, which I was admitted for 5 days. The care was incredible, awesome nurses, and the Dr was very understanding and built a good treatment with my GI. Over all, it was a great experience and no complaints!!!!<//review>

I have always went to this hospital, but when I checked it Friday morning it was the most horrible experience ever. I'm 3 months pregnant,going in for abdominal pain,vomiting blood, haven't been able to keep any fluids or foods down in the last 3 days hoping they will do there jobs and help me. But never came around to doing so. Nurses would walk out as I was talking to thme and letting them.know I was in discomfort, was told the obgyn doctor Parker would come check on me on Friday night at 11 pm, but never showed up tell Saturday at 1130 am. Was waiting for a room in women center area but waiting for 24 hrs to get discharge because doctor parker wanted to tell me how I felt. Was worse experience ever with this hospital and I will be pursing to file more complaints and hiring a attorney to go further since they even want to sit there and lie saying he stated he apologized for how he came in talking which never happened and only trying to cover there asses...again worse experience here after going to them for about 9 yrs. Very disappointed that they didn't do there job right but not only that the doctor again doctor Parker discharged me still with pain, me feeling nausea,  not being able still to keep any fluids or food down and not carrying about my baby. So I recommend not to go there nor to see the ridiculous, rude, lying no good doctor, doctor parker when is job discription is an Obgyn.< /Review>

<review>I went to the E.R because of chest pain . Ended up being there for 6 hours . The doctor Dr. Morkei was the worst doctor I've ever had to deal with in my life he was so rude, unprofessional and hurtful.  He was talking bad about people behind their back and mine I could hear him say I don't want to see her right now when I was nothing but nice to him. He told the nurse that after I had her go ask him what was wrong with me that is all. I'm so upset and will never come back here again</review><Name>JJ Harper<//Name><resp>None</resp>< pictures>

< Review>
The nurse taking the vital signs (Hispanic lady) was rude, she kept rolling her eyes. My question to the hospital is, why hired people without the vision of the hospital. I didn't get her name but she started her shift at 7pm on 4/2/18. She was upset because kids were crying and scare. Hello!!! They're kids and they get scare. She yelled at my husband "you can't just enter just because the door it's open". When my husband was called inside she got mad because he asked her if I could come in too. She told him "she's gonna have to stand" as walked in she looked at me with her chola mad face. I called the emergency room to find out status about my husband, the same nurse answered and was rude once again to me. The way she asked for my husband's name and she asked me to spell it out. She put me on hold and then transferred me to a different without letting me anything. She needs to learn how to answer phones in a professional way. Why hired gangster or ghetto people? To treat patients in a disrespectful way?<//Review>

Came in for afternoon lunch,  ordered burgers and got served a ton of fries between us! Had to take some of it home, left happy and full! Great shakes,  too.< /review>

Another  meh.  You have to stare down the server to get service.  And look at the pile of napkins I needed to stave off the grease on the bun of my "sandwich" :-/<//Review>

Solid burger restaurant with a decent offering. Service was adequate but not friendly. Will eat there again because I love burgers. Hoping for more earnest service next time.<//Text>

Good consistent burgers and fries.  Definitely where to go if you're seeking the quintessential burger.  I wouldn't go again for brunch as the brunch food is barely cafeteria worthy but unlimited mimosas made for a very wild afternoon.<//text>

We ordered a Philly Cheese Steak sandwich and it was pretty good, but it wasn't anything that blew us away. The fries were fresh and crispy even though we went late in the evening. I would definitely get the sandwich again, but I'm more excited to try one of their burgers. Hopefully they will prove to be above average!

Because this place isn't super amazing, I feel like the price is a little on the pricier side which makes me a little reluctant to frequent here. I mean, why not go elsewhere where there is cheaper and better food, right?

Service was good once we got someone's attention to take our order. Everyone seemed to be busy cleaning the restaurant for closing in the next hour. Restaurant is inviting and spacious with TVs for those who are looking for a place to watch sports. Menu is pretty extensive and so will cater to different cravings.

For now, this place gets a 3-star review. Definitely will update when I go back in the future when I get to try one of their burgers.< /Text>

Went here tonight before bowling to celebrate my birthday a day late with some friends. DO NOT EAT HERE. A COCKROACH CRAWLED OUT OF MY SALAD. I'm a manager at a restaurant so I'm usually really easy to serve, and I tend to have extra patience when eating out. I never sent food back, I don't care about mistakes, I'm easy going. On top of it being unclean and having a bug crawl out of my salad, after paying the full amount and tipping 20 percent I let the waitress know about the cockroach. The way she responded sadly told me she was aware of their bug problems despite her 'surprised face'. In and out is cleaner and most likely better quality. I will not be returning.< /Review>

When I'm in the mood for a generous burger, this is one of my go-to places.  You'll never run out of different types of burgers to try.  All of the food is consistently good.  You can sit inside or outside the restaurant area which is flanked by a well-stocked bar showing the current sports game of the day.  They really won me over when I was with a friend just to have a drink.  One of us ordered an alcoholic drink, the other a hot chocolate.  No charge for the hot chocolate.  Why?  Because they offer them free to the kiddies who are there with their parents.</Text>

They forgot the topping for the burger. The vegetarian option don't taste at all. The cocktails were just rum with water. For that price it was very disappointing!</review>

<review>When I first started coming to Alameda, I lover Burgermeister. My hype for them has gone down since those days. Service was kinda slow, in the middle of a weekday when there wasn't a lot of people in & they also got my order wrong (I asked for a condiment to be left off the burger & it wasn't). Also, the food isn't as good as it used to be for the price IMO<//review>< pics>

< Review>
this coffee shop was really cool and worth the trip out to it. i really liked their DGAF attitude in the merchandise and the colorful names they choose for some of their beverages on the menu. the team members behind the counter were really friendly and suggested awesome drinks for us to try. i forgot the name but the candy cane mocha (iced) was delicious. i'd highly suggest trying that if you visit.</Review>

<Rate>5<//Rate><text>I went to visit this fine establishment today. I was approached by a member of the public who goes by the name of “Karen” I assume and I they tried harassing me for no apparent reason and kept telling me to go back to my own country. The manager at coffee dose threw the anti Karen coffee cup on the women and she vanished into thin air. I would highly recommend and I don’t even like coffee< /text>< Pics>

< Review>
I personally love the Karen quotes they’re amazing and touching to younger generations so we can feel at home and have an equal environment where we all know that the term “Karen” isn’t toward women named Karen it’s toward people who act as a Karen. For example if you’re rude to employees because you don’t get what you want, instead of being polite Bc you think you’re so entitled, then we refer to you as a Karen. If you  throw a fit about not wanting to wear a mask in the middle of a PANDEMIC in the cafe because it’s against your “rights” we refer to you as a Karen. Taking situations that are at level one and taking it to level 100, creating a whole scene because of a minor inconvenience, you’re a Karen.❤️ Wear your masks🥰< /Review>

<Review>Last time I was down in LA I enjoyed a nice cup of the 'The Marry Matcha' from here. The barista behind the register was an absolute doll! They really know how to serve up a good cup. I'd definitely recommend stopping by here to enjoy a nice beverage.

Thank you for the great customer service and incredible atmosphere :)< /Review>< gmapID>

The Coffee and atmosphere of this place is amazing. Staff was incredibly nice and helpful as well. I would 100% come here again. The only people writing negative reviews are people with the name Karen who are offended by what was clearly intended as a joke.</Review>

I don't even live in the states I'm in Canada but I saw this places TikTok about their "Karen" cups & I just wanna say that this establishment has my support all the way from Ontario Canada. Keep making hilarious captions on cups & keep pissing off those Karen's it's a beautiful sight to see 💛<//review>

<text>I absolutely adore Coffee ! When the previous coffee shop closed down, I was hoping that we would get a cute independent coffee shop open in its place. As a community, we really lucked out! I've tried a number of their drinks now and I've been pleased with each one of them. The service is fantastic as well, all of the baristas are so kind.< /text>< Rate>

<Text>My father lives right around the corner from this new location. Right away, props for opening during such a tough time for all service industry businesses.
Has a great feel from the moment you walk in. Super friendly barista "Eli"
Thank you Eli for my delicious cold brew.
Glad to see they are brewing Tectonic roasters. Shows they really care about quality.

All in all a great experience. Thank you< /Text>< Name>

< Review>
On a total whim I visited this coffee house today and was pleasantly surprised by the hilarious merchandise, attention to detail in the decor and the delicious latte. If you're a fan of CBD or humor in general, be sure to check out this location. I recommend the latte with almond milk and a dose of CBD.</Review>

<Text>Great coffee shop! Really cute decor with funny/catchy phrases on cups.  There's parking in the back alley and you can walk directly in from there or meter parking up front.  I tried 'The Goldie' which is a tumeric latte recommended by the Barista.   It was GREAT and a must try if you like tumeric drinks..</Text>< Time>
