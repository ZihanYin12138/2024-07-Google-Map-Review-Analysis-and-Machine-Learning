I was so happy with my experience here! Everyone was so kind. I was in so much tooth pain I couldn't even see straight! They tried everything but my tooth wouldn't budge. They gave me 2 referrals to an oral surgeon and when I went to the front desk to pay they told me that I didn't owe them anything! They are amazing people that actually care!</Text>

<Review>Staff are great. Very welcoming. Great service. Dr. Ly has a very light hand, and he was actually very gentle when he cleaned my teeth. He really connects with you as a patient, and he makes sure that your teeth are really getting the care it needs by inspecting what needs care and what needs to be watched out for. I highly recommend him and this place!<//Review>< date>

Dr. Ly is wonderful! He is always kind and personable. He’s a great dentist and is very gentle and concerned for his patients comfort. My hygienist Sylvia is also great! She is throughout and gentle at the same time.

If you are looking for a great dentist team Royal Family Dental is the place for you!<//text>

My husband, my daughter and son, whole family are the fan of Dr. Ly. We feel warm welcome in his staff and his office. My husband had a teeth remove done by Dr.Ly and he told me that he felt so amazing of Dr. Ly’s work. He said Dr. Ly is the best dentist he ever have and told me that I should have him to do my teeth too.
After visited Dr.Ly’s office to do my teeth and I feel the same way . Dr. Ly always smile and talk to his patient very throughly. He shown his care to everyone who come to his office and want to everyone leave with happy feeling and satisfied. He went to extra work to help his patients.  Our family is very happy that we are in a good hand of a very good excellent dentist.  We are highly recommend Dr. Ly< /text>

< Review>
I have been going to dentists in Ventura and Los Angeles County for the past 40 years and Dr. Ly is by far the best.  Recently, I had a dental emergency.  Even though I was a new patient, Dr. Ly was able to help me and fit me right away.  He is very skilled at his craft, as I did not feel any pain or discomfort as he performed a root canal and other dental services surrounding my issue.  In addition, to being a great dentist, he is very professional, courteous and pleasant.

His staff is equally wonderful and the office is very clean.  I could not be happier with my experience at Royal Family Dental and am very appreciative of all they did for me.<//Review>

<Name>nam lui<//Name><text>The best dentist I ever have!!! No questions!!!
Dr. Ly has did my teeth several times for last 2 years and I highly recommend him to who want to see the dentist with kind heart and good skills to take care of your teeth.
His office is very nice and clean , comfortable environment with nice staff warm welcome  each time I came in visited. The most impressed is Dr. Ly's skill and be patient with no rush, he greeted each person with big smile, he asked questions and discuss the details thoroughly. I have had several teeth removed in the past with other dentists, and I always very nervous because the pain and swollen after. I had Dr. Ly removed my teeth this time and it was amazing that it was not much pain and did not swollen after the moved the teeth, I even did not take any pain kill medicine at all. I am sure will keep back to see Dr. Ly who is the best dentist I trusted!!!</text></record>

Dr. J. Ly & his staff are great! My dog ate my mouth guard!!! It's true, my little dog, Squeak, stole my mouth guard off the night stand & took it under the bed, where I find all kinds of missing objects.... Well, she didn't chew the entire mouth guard, just nibbled on each end, so, I call Royal Family Dental & Dr. Ly got my in the next day. I love that they are using all precaustions & I felt comfortable going to my appointment. When I arrived (about 5 min early), I called the office from the parking lot, had to wait a couple minutes, while they finished up with the previous patient. When that patient left, they called me & I went into the office, wearing my mask & they got right to work on doing what had to be done for my new mouth guard. Dr. Ly & his staff have always been super friendly & professional & I wouldn't go anywhere else! Highly recommend this dental office!<//Review>

<text>I avoid the dentist like the plague as I have had some very bad experiences in the past, but I had a dental emergency and needed to find a dentist. So I got a list from my insurance and googled Dr. Ly and saw he had some good reviews so I figured I’d give him a try. Not only did he answer my call on a holiday but he got me in the next day. He was very nice, easy to talk to and made sure everything he was saying was in regular human terms and not medical terms. His staff were very friendly also. He referred me to a specialist (which no dentist prior has done for what I need and is probably the reason it wasn’t done correctly and I am now needing it done again) and when I commented, he basically said part of his job as a general dentist is to know when to do something himself and when not to. His philosophy is making sure his patients are happy, healthy and taken care of and if that means passing the ball to one of his teammates he does. No one stop shop here. Just Quality. I LOVE that. I left feeling like I was in good hands and when we are all able to go back to the dentist regularly, I will be sticking with him and bringing my daughter there. I highly recommend Dr. Ly.< /text>< pictures>

First, the office is very clean and they follow strict COVID guidelines. I feel very safe having my dental exams/procedures with Dr. Ly.
Second, my teeth look amazing! Dr. Ly explained my options thoroughly, I made a decision and I could not be happier with the results!
I highly recommend Royal Dental!< /review>

My girlfriend had a very bad toothache and I waas referred to Dr. Ly.  He was able to see my girlfriend the day I called tthe office for the first time.  He was
very professional and discovered that she needed a filling in a tooth.  He was able to perform this procedure right away.  He did this for a very reasonable fee.  I give Royal Family Dental 5 stars.  Very satisfied.  Excellent< /Review>

I cant say enough nice things about this place!!!
I had been suffering with teeth problems for years until it finally got so bad that i forced myself to see a dentist. I am probably the dental patient from hell. Before coming to Royal family Dental, it had been many moons since i had seen a dentist. A combination of fears and a horrific experience in the past had kept me away. Dr. Jonathan Ly is AMAZING!!! So compassionate and insanely thorough!
Excellent support and care here. Wonderful
Staff, incredible experience and zero complaint.
A rate. By far the best dental experience I’ve ever had.< /Text>

I have been going to this office for over 30 years.  Since Dr Ly took over - I found him to be a very kind and gentle dentist.  His staff is professional and their protocol since Covid is based on safety and efficiency<//review>

I am impressed with the entire office.  Dr. Ly has assembled the "A" Team.   I had a difficult procedure and thought the entire 2 hours I was relaxed with a complete understanding of what was occurring.  I believe I have been blessed to have stumbled upon one of the most honest and professional.Dentist in my 64 years of a lot of Dental procedures.  A bonus is the very cool video screen you can watch to escape the procedure.  Thank you Dr. Ly and team!< /Text>

My first appointment with Royal Family Dentistry was during the COVID-19 pandemic and it went extremely well. They followed all proper procedures. Just a normal cleaning, but after 4 years of not going to the dentist. I felt little discomfort and he did a great job. Would recommend!!</review>

I had the pleasure of getting my teeth cleaned by Dr. Johnathan Ly in July 2020. Due to the COVID-19  pandemic during this time, I was a little nervous about performing any medical/dental procedure. However I felt assured of my personal health and safety based on the procedures Royal Family Dental implemented. When I first walked in, I noticed all of the team members were practicing proper social distancing, wearing face masks, and taking the temperature of patients when patients walked in.

After getting my temperature taken, I proceeded to get my teeth cleaned by Dr. Johnathan Ly. Dr. Johnathan Ly did a fantastic job ensuring my teeth were cleaned with little-to-no discomfort. Dr. Johnathan Ly was very cognizant of my feelings and would frequently check in with me to see if there was any discomfort at all with my procedure. In addition, Dr. Johnathan Ly was also very informative as to how I can take better care of my teeth. I have a tendency to brush my teeth over-aggressively and Dr. Johnathan Ly was able to provide me some recommendations as to how to address this matter. I would absolutely recommend Dr. Johnathan Ly to anybody looking for a new dentist in the Simi Valley, Thousand Oaks, and Westlake Village Area.< /text>

Truly my best experience ever with a dentist. Growing up, my family always bounced around as we could never find a dentist that we all liked. Dr. Ly and his staff are truly a family dentistry and they are very good at making you comfortable and explaining things. I cannot recommend this dentist enough and if you give them a shot, you will not be disappointed.<//text>

I had a dental emergency on Sunday, since I had previously been to Royal Family Dental for cleanings I reached out to them via their webpage. Within a few hours Dr. Ly called me to assess the problem and scheduled an appointment. He told me someone from his office would call me Monday to provide their Covid protocol and they would try to get me in sooner if they had a cancelation. Their office opens at 8:30am and five minutes later I received a phone call confirming my insurance and informing me of their Covid protocal. Also received a txt taking me to an online questionnaire regarding potential Covid exposure. About 90 minutes later I received a second call saying they  were able to see me that day at 3pm.  The entire staff was friendly and helpful. After taking my temperature Ana took to a room and took x-rays of the tooth. Then Dr. Ly came in explained the situation and my options. A little over an hour later I was done. Going back in a few weeks for the final step. Dr. Ly, Ana and his entire staff were wonderful and I highly recommend them.<//text>

Highly recommend Dr Ly.  He is very professional, friendly, attentive, trustworthy, makes sure you are comfortable, and puts your mind at ease. I have been coming here for over 8 years, before Dr. Chung retired, and have ever had a bad experience. The staff are also very helpful. Just had a filling and crown fixed, without feeling any pain or discomfort.</Text>

Dr.Ly and staff are very courteous & professional.I arrived for my appointment and was seated within 5 minutes.Then everything was explained to me in detail before starting the procedure . Dr.Ly very patient and gentle and it was over before I even knew it , got my instructions reguarding post procedure & also received a follow up call from Dr.Ly the next day. Brilliant experience that I have never experienced with other dentists I highly recommend Royal Family Dental for all dental needs . Best experience ever !< /Text>

Dr. Ly is AMAZING. He is so gentle with you and takes his time to make sure you get the best results. I’m very sensitive to pain but when he numbs my gums up I can honestly say that I barely feel anything. He is definitely a dentist I can trust. I highly recommend him for any dental procedure.<//review>

I'm not a dentist going type guy....Dr. Ly will attest to that.....I went in, after way too many years of not goung to visit a dentist, with more than a little trepidation 😧. However, I was delighted with how I was treated, the professionalism, the communication and the work performed.....extraction, caps, cleaning....its was all painless and the results marvelous. Going back to discuss some cosmetic dental work and I'll be seeing Dr. Ly regularly from here on in....HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.<//Review>

My visits to Royal Family Dental are always very pleasant, I have my regular cleaning done twice a year. Everyone in the office is so nice, really friendly; I usually arrive a few minutes early to my appointments and never have to wait pass the appointment schedule time (A+).

My hygienist Silvia is GREAT, and always very thorough and gentle…she must take very good notes because she always follows up any previous recommendations and knows exactly if I have been doing my homework or not (A+). For me, the happiest moment of the visit is that I feel relax and don’t have to worry about my sensitive gag reflex problems during the cleaning process.

I am so grateful and would recommend Royal Family Dental to any friends and family. Mauricio C.<//text>

Dr. Ly and his staff are great! He was very accommodating when I had an unfortunate dental emergency. We contacted him on a Sunday morning and he promptly returned our call and kept in contact with us throughout the day, checking in on me and answering any questions that came up. He promptly scheduled an appointment to see me the next day. He took the time to work on my teeth and I am very pleased with the results!</text>

I am new to this dentist, but Dr.Ly impressed me with his personal care and excellent work.  I can highly recommend his office.

The office takes excellent precautions with the COVID-19 pandemic and felt save there.  I was there this week for having cavities worked on and Dr. Ly did an excellent job making this a completely pain free experience.  The staff is very friendly and professional.

I can highly recommend this office<//Text>

Exceeded everything I’ve been looking for in a dentistry.. DR LY IS AMAZING. he made me feel comfortable and put my anxiety at ease. I’ve been looking for a dentist to start making my teeth better and I finally have found one. The staff is amazing as well, also arrived 15 min early and was seen right away. I can’t say enough. It’s clean has a great vibe and no judgement from the staff. This place is a hidden gem. 😊😊< /Text>

Dr. Lee is a Wonderful, gentle, kind  and to the extreme gifted as a dentist!  Came from out of state, and he rearranged his schedule for me;  and for two crowns to boot!! When you walk through the doors, you are welcomed with a smile and great efficiency:))</Review>

I had a fantastic experience at Royal Family Dental. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. I was called in right on time and did not have to endure a tedious wait (like you do at most dentists). Dr Ly performed my filling; he was extremely gentle. I felt no pain!!  He listened to all my concerns and answered all of my questions in great detail.< /review>

<review>I'm so glad I found Dr. Ly! I've been to so many dentists and Dr. Ly is by far the best! He was very gentle throughout the whole procedure and would give me a heads up before doing something. He explained things really well and I felt that I was consulted about my opinions and thoughts. Even though he's a little far from LA, I'll definitely make the effort to go out and see him.< /review></record></dataset><record>

This place has always been amazing. The staff is extremely friendly and they always make sure my comfort is top priority! 10/10 would definitely recommend to friends and family!

Dr. Lee is a terrific and highly experienced doctor who knows a lot of really specific procedures that other doctors don’t know about, like removing white and brown stains from your teeth. Look no further for the best dentist in town.</Review>

I had a lot of anxiety about going to the dentist to have cavities filled, but Dr. Ly (and his assistant) were very patient with me and answered all my questions.  I’m happy to say I didn’t even feel the shot. I’m glad to have found such a competent and caring dentist.<//Text>

Never would I have thought that I would actually feel comfortable at a dentist appointment! Dr. Ly and his staff took time explaining my dental plan to me. They told me exactly what to expect and addressed all my concerns and fillings (heh, get it?), making sure I had no reason to worry. I could care less what 4 out of 5 dentists recommend if Dr. Ly isn't one of those dentists! This dental office deserves a plaque!< /text>

<Review>First visit and must admit I hadnt been to the dentist in way too long so i was definitely nervous. Last dentist i went to wasn’t the nicest and with other medical issues and sadly family losses time just got away from me. I am so glad i went to Royal Family Dental. I never once felt judged and they made me feel so comfortable like I had been coming here for years! I am so happy with the care they provide and the calming atmosphere. It’s weird to be exited to go back to the dentist!< /Review>< Pictures>

I chipped my front two teeth the night before an important work shift and he was able to get me in before I had to make it and fix me up perfectly.

I've been a patient with Royal Family dentist for about 15 years, and have never considered elsewhere for my dentistry services. Dr. Ly continues to carry the best traditions of quality, ownership, and care that I have enjoyed these many years (yes, I have indeed enjoyed coming to the dentist). The staff is friendly, caring, available, with the offices convenient and relaxing. Would recommend highly.< /Review>

Dr. Ly is the best. First time going to a dentist after almost 2 years. I usually hate going to the dentist, hence not having gone for awhile, but this time was way different than before. The facility was very nice and the staff was super friendly so I felt welcomed as a new patient. As for the cleaning, it was surprisingly pain free. I usually associate the dentist with bleeding and sore gums but not here. This place is amazing< /Text>

Dr. Chung is a wonderful and caring doctor. She is extremely knowledgeable and has a wonderful bedside manor. She genuinely does what's in best interest for her patients and what her patients ask. Dr. Chung is the most honest dentist I have had look at my teeth. She took as much time as needed to figure out what was wrong with my tooth with so much compassion. Her staff is so polite and wonderful as well.<//text>

<Review>Nobody likes to, but you have to go to the dentist. Royal Family Dental makes it as painless as possible. I had work done today, and the time flew as I sat back and watched reruns of “Friends” with earphones that drowned out the drilling noises. The distraction kept me relaxed, and the time flew by. The office is small and personal; I rarely have to wait. Dr. Ly and the staff are super sweet and gentle.< /Review></record>

<userid>112954570639878743727<//userid><text>Went to see Dr. Ly for an emergency because my usual dentist was not available, and was completely blown away by the level of professionalism and care I received. Dr. Ly’s office is clean, modern and super friendly. His warm and caring personality made me feel super comfortable and he explained every step of the process to make sure I was ok. Added bonus, every room has Netflix for you to watch during your visit. Despite his young looks, his level of standard are some of the highest I’ve experienced. I could tell he keeps up to date with the latest equipment and procedures. I can not rave enough about Dr. Ly and his lovely staff. I will be referring all friends and family to him!</text></record></dataset><record>

I was referred here when I didn't have a dentist. Never had any issues here and have been coming here for 6 years now. Everyone is friendly and welcoming. If I could give 10 stars I would.<//review>

<Review>Dr. Ly and his staff were amazing. I felt extremely comfortable, I had no fears when I got my root canal. Before my visit with Dr. Ly, I previously went to anothet dentist at Lindero Canyon Dental and I experienced the worst post pain for months after my root canal leavinh me with serious TMJ.
With Dr. Ly,  I had no post surgery after pain. He was so professional, so meticulous with the procedure, made sure I was in good condition and okay.  I also appreciated the fact that Dr. Ly was able to and willing to work with me financially. The staff was very wonderful, accommodating and professional as well. I would definitely recommend Royal Family Dental as your go to Dentist.</Review>< pics>

His office is clean and his staff are very professional and friendly! He is very calm and patient and answered every question I threw at him. Every step of the way he would let me know what he was doing and asked if I was okay moving forward. So caring! I big plus is that I never felt like the appointment was rushed. The office is up to date and even has a screen in the room so you can watch Netflix during your visit! There is a parking lot in the back and I didn't have any issues finding a spot. As someone who's been to quite a few dentists, I am so relieved to have found Dr. Ly He is worth the 1 hour drive each way!<//text>< UserId.>

Everyone in my family has been going to this office for years.  Love them and recommend them to all our friends.  Lately, we've been seeing Dr. Li, the newest doctor there, and we couldn't be more impressed with his friendliness, professionalism, and attention to detail.  My husband and son are both almost impossible to numb and we've had an issue with other dentists in the past not believing that they're not numb before drilling and not being willing to give them all the numbing meds they need, but Dr. Li is very patient and does a great job making sure they're totally numb before diving in.  No more excruciating fillings for my guys!< /text>

After experiencing extreme pain over the past week I needed an evaluation immediately. When I called the office I was delighted at the professionalism the front desk had given me and told me to come in that morning. Although I was not scheduled that day they were able to accommodate me and fit me in. Dr. Ly calmness and knowledge put me at ease while figuring out the cause of my pain. After some quick insight he figured out the issue and recommended me to a specialist right away. I can not express how thankful I am for this establishment and their care for my situation. If it were not for them I would still be in a considerable amount of pain. I would gladly recommend them to anyone of my fiends and family.< /text>

Staff and Dr. Are very pleasant and know how to treat patients w exceptional care! I have been coming here for over 8 years and will continue to be loyal here. I no longer live in Simi valley but will make the drive. There is no unnecessary treatments being forced and Dr. Ly takes his time to explain everything throughly. I even completed my Invisalign treatment, and I am so happy with my results! I have had traditional braces in the past (didn't wear my retainer like I should have) so I decided to do Invisalign to correct my crocked teeth and Dr. Ly was so nice and even followed up via email 2 days after my treatment to check in and make sure I was not in unbearable pain. I truly appreciated the care and concern he had, I didn't experience this with my previous orthodontist in my past treatment. So 5 stars!! I recommend all my friends and family to come here.</text>

I've been going to Royal Family Dental for at least 15 years and I've had a lot of things done. They have always gone to great lengths to be sure everything is done the best it can be and that I'm satisfied. Going to the dentist is never fun, but they do their best to make it that way.< /review>

Dr. Ly and his staff are rockstars! I was surprised at how much I enjoyed going to the dentist. I found Royal Family Dental by looking at all the glowing reviews and was skeptical of all the positive reviews at first but now I can personally attest that they are all true. Liliana was great to work with in scheduling my appointment and getting my insurance information. It was a little hard to find the building but just look for the Royal Professionals Building sign and turn in - they have a huge parking lot behind the building. Dr. Ly and his assistant Ana were so gentle throughout the exam. I had what must have been a bajillion questions but Dr. Ly was so patient through it all and worked with me to plan out my dental goals. I'm considering doing Invisalign through Dr. Ly and can't wait to start!</review>

<Text>Been going here for 12 yrs.(my sister too). What I love about them is they don’t upsell you on cosmetic dental work. They don’t make you feel like your are buying a car. They don’t pressure you. I left them because my insurance changed back in 2010-2012 and each dentist I went to felt like you’re dealing with a car salesman (and we know those are the bottom feeders of all professions). Dr Chung & Dr Lee and staff are great. I was kinda worried when they took in a new young Doctor but fortunately he has the same aire about him. Humble, caring like Dr Chung herself. They’re a small practice, they remember who you are! My teeth are great because back in 2007, Dr Chung look at me straight in the eye, and told me this huge lesson about flossing. I floss every night since.</Text>< rate>

<text>Our local dentist passed away after taking care of our family for 8 years.  We were stuck and needed a trusted new dentist.  After reaching out on Facebook we had a overwhelming response to go and see Dr. Chung.  She is super friendly, efficient and has a great staff.  Thanks for the two new crowns and great service!< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None< /resp>< gmapID>

Stopped here to eat on our way back home (2hr drive) and do not regret stopping here. Food was really delicious!! Tortillas are hand made!! Tacos were big with a lot of meat! Everything was delicious rice, beans, and the asada, pastor, barbacoa de borrego, and chorizo were really good.! Highly recommend!< /review>

<text>Very delicious tacos. Home made tortillas. Big portions. I ordered three tacos thinking they would be small, but they were huge. I had the asada tacos and they were very good. The aguas frescas are also pretty delicious as well. Highly recommend it!<//text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

<review>Updating my review- i have been a customer of Rani for a couple of months now.  She really does a great job and is very polite. The only negatives I have is that sometimes there is a very long wait and also the location is not very safe.< /review><GmapID>0x80c36434d0aadacf:0xd2d0c7e6ca66e769<//GmapID><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPaM7ERuhvC3iFXrkCWhw8xqkImlKgzg8vhjSgk=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics><Rating>4<//Rating></record></dataset><record>

I went here and the place was packed full of customers. Even with everyone waiting she still did an incredible job with my eyebrows. Not to mention she does it for an incredible price. I would 10/10 recommend this place to anyone and will definitely be going back:)<//text>

Just a small business trying to survive.  This woman works very hard and does an amazing job.  Plus she doesn't charge that much.  I would give it 5 stars if she could make it a little more private.</Text>

Mamta does a great job making me look more like a professional woman and less like a teenage boy struggling to grow out my first facial hair. After seeing her, I no longer worry about anyone seeing me in direct sunlight.< /Review>

I love love love the woman who threads my eyebrows (Kaye's). I've been going to her for months now. She used to be at the mall in the nail shop but now she's here. So convienant because I can go get my nails done right next door and run errands not too far.</Text>

I am not picky, and I get my eyebrows threaded monthly. However, I was not pleased with the threading I received here. I told her a little clean-up only. She changed the shape of my brows, she made them too thin and uneven. Also, she left a bald spot. I had to point it out to her. I would not recommend this place, even if it's cheap.<//review>

Sviatlana is a very pleasant and efficient person. I had made an appointment, and was seen right away. Working from the documents I had left a few days earlier, all the paperwork was done and just needed my signature. Happily, I have refunds coming!  I hope Sviatlana is available next year!<//text>

I've used H&R block for years. I've never had any issues with the iRS and I believe it is due to the proper service provided by the staff. I feel that the service given is by a knowledgeable team. I trust them with my filing. I've always received answers to any and all questions I've ever had.< /text>

The lady who did my taxes was honestly the best customer service I’ve ever had , but what I just didn’t like was the price I got charged for doing my taxes at HR BLOCK . So expensive .. the adds on tv and social media is a joke . I’m going to be paying HR BLOCK 330 dollars for my HR BLOCK doing my taxes ...</review>

These ladies are seriously so beautiful inside and out and truly wonderful and such a asset to the name of the last studio. I cannot wait to go to my next appointment and I will continuously promote them because I had the best service there. It's so nice to take part in Acts of self-care especially right now so this was much needed.<//text><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmapID>

Today she called to cancel with them. We just don’t feel comfortable going to appointments like this during the pandemic. They refused to close her account unless she came in IN PERSON to do it. The absolutely last thing you should be forcing patrons to do right now. I understand some will disagree with our logic, but to us this displays a clear lack of care for customers, so we will never spend our money here again. Which is sad because until this, the service was always good.<//text>< gmapID>

Staff is very friendly and professional.   I've tried three lash stylists (Maya, Reyna and Martine) and  very knowledgeable in guiding you to right look you want to obtain.< /text>

I love the experience and service that Amazing Lash provides! The complimentary drinks are always a plus. Paige is my favorite stylist out of 7 stylists I've seen. She's detailed oriented and incredibly polite. I highly recommend her and cannot say enough great things about her! Paige has been the only one who really listened to what I was looking for. Other stylists tried convincing and pressuring me into getting pricier lashes. If you're looking for someone who is detailed oriented and a true professional, ask for Paige.< /review>

Martine did wonders on my lashes! I went in nervous and not knowing what to expect. She walked me through every step and made sure I was comfortable at each point. She made my lashes full to the point that I no longer use thick eyeliner to make my lashes look fuller. They are full with a fresh face! Thank you!!! I can't wait for my next appointment!<//review>

<text>I recommend this place to anyone who wants a beautiful set of lashes. I was so fortunate to have Martine as my lash artist and let me tell you... she is the best of the best! She was friendly and caring and very professional. She gave me the the most amazing set of lashes and made sure I was comfortable the entire time I was there. If you decide to go here please make your appointment with Martine, she is the BEST!< /text>< pictures>

< Review>
My lash tech was Brenda.  She's amazing.  The studio itself is perfect.  From the moment you walk through the doors to the moment you leave everything is just what a discerning woman needs for a bit of pampering. The studio is very clean and bright.  I've never waited longer than a few minutes to be taken back.  Is a refreshing change to have a business that runs on time.  The back office is very nice and perfectly clean.  The consistency of having their own technique has proven to be a keeper as my lashes do not fall off as my last few lash persons did not have staying power in their method.  When I leave,  I book my next appointment so I can always enjoy my perfect lash look. My lashes are a cross between gorgeous and sexy and they're volume lashes.  Custom and perfect.</Review>

From the moment I walked in I received excellent customer service! Everyone was super nice and friendly.  I was offered a complementary glass of wine which was much needed last night.  Brandi my lash stylist was so nice and patient with me. She was so sweet and thoroughly  explained after care with me. I highly recommend you booking with Amazing Lash.</Text>

<review>I've had lash extensions done before but they have always either fell out prematurely or there was too much glue. When I came to Amazing Lash Studio in Oxnard, I honestly had such a great experience. The staff are so friendly and thorough. They definitely want your lashes to last as long as possible. And the stylists are great! They went through all of the styles with me and explained what effect they may give me. I really liked the cute look.

< Review>
I went in there I signed for the consent agreement and I asked for the test to make sure I didn’t have allergies. Not only they didn’t perform the test but it turned out I was allergic. They put a full set with extra strong glue (without asking if what kind of glue I wanted). Next day my eyes started to swell really bad and I went back for them to take them out. It took over an hour because they put sooo much extra strong glue they couldn’t get them out. I had to go to the emergency room to get a shot so my inflammation would go down because my eyes were soooo swelled up I barely could open them. When I called them to let them know they told me that they could give me $20 off my next visit. I spent over $200 and they were only going to give me $20 back. Ridiculous. It was so hard to get a hold of the manager, and they were not helpful. I will never go back. They lady who did them was new with barely any experience and even though she was nice they should have assisted her. This place is overpriced and the staff wasn’t very nice.< /Review>

<review>Actually i cancelled my membership because as time passed they kept charging mote and more and they dont explain why they charge you what they do untill u already got the work done and by then its too late to say no thanks i just got chaged 147 dollars for a full set and honestly who has that kimd of money every single time to get their eyelashes done and so im not satisfied with my results either so i will never be using their services again or recomending them either. Its better to just get store bought lashes at least then youll know what ur pating and getting you moneys worth rather than a being riipped off. Not ok at all....... 👎👎👎👎< /review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

< Review>
I've been spoiled by Birdie's Bowls! On my vacation from AZ we stopped by for my first acai bowl and before the weekend was done I had to go back two more times before I going back home. I've tried other acai bowls from then but honestly haven't been able to recreate the magic of Birdie's. It's a curse! I need to go back!<//Review>

<Review>Delicious pitaya bowl, I had the pitaya colada bowl, and it was great! Clean, fresh ingredients, sweetness overall in the bowl. The bowl was a nice size, a generous amount of pitaya serving. The customer service was just right, I even signed up for their member rewards program to earn points with each purchase.

I would recommend this place for a superbowl or smoothie!</Review>< pics>

Look for the OC Mix sign and park. Enter the building and the pathway is split into a Y (cross way). Walk towards your right side and Birdie is all the way down the hall.

I got the Classic and asked for toasted coconut ($1 more). It tastes amazing and cold.

Nice shop with friendly customer service. A bit over price in my opinion. I do enjoy their classic and pitaya colada bowls. I love the toasted coconut so I always ask for extra for a $1 more. This is the spot to eat when you don't want anything too heavy or you been eating heavy food the last few days and you want to cut down on carbs but still feel energize.

They have some benches to eat and chill or you can take your bowl on a walk enjoying your healthy bowl and checking out their vendors.

I would definitely like my friends/family out here for a health light meal.<//Review>

Great spot if you want healthy lunch. I had the Pitaya Colada made with Acai. I have tried the other bowls and all are delicious and they provide you a good amount. Service and ordering is quick and easy. They have seating area however it is not large but usually you can find a seat. Staff is very friendly. Look forward to going again.< /review>

<review>It's unfortunate when a soothie acai/bowl place doesn't know if their granola is gluten free. I should have not ordered at that point but I just got it without. For me the bowl lacked balance.</review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMHN2qUHF62ZwvRN9TgENzp7jm9rhI3utlubC4O=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures>< resp>

<review>Conveniently located inside a hipster mall with open seating near other restaurants and boutique stores. The pitaya (fancy name for dragonfruit, I believe) was good, although the fruits on top were a bit sour. They offer a bottle of honey for customers for drizzling sweetness to their hearts content. The price was above your normal strip mall located fruit bowl place, but I expect that's because Birdie probably sources better ingredients.  I also appreciate that the bowl is primarily pitaya (or acacia) and not yogurt. I don't remember if I read the word organic or local though, but I also didn't do much research beforehand on this spot, as I was invited for a meeting here. All in all, if I'm in the area and craving juice or fruit bowl, I'd consider coming here again, if only to check out the coffee shop too.</review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

My boyfriend I moved into our apartment at the end of February and so far we have had an excellent experience at Slate Creek. Overall the community is gorgeous with all of the surrounding nature and pretty quiet throughout the day and night. Kristin helped us through every step of the move in process and was incredibly helpful and quick to respond to all of my questions. Still to this day she is my go to for any questions or concerns I have and is fantastic at her job. The maintenance staff here as well is awesome, whenever we put in a work order they come within an hour or two or sometimes even faster than that and will fix anything so quickly and efficiently. Also the inside of our apartment was completely renovated before we moved in, everything brand new and updated which I absolutely loved. Very modern, clean, and simple with plenty of space for two people. The kitchen space I will say is a little small but we have made it work.<//Text>

<review>I recently signed a lease to move into Slate Creek apartments in June. So far my experience has been incredible! Kristin B. has been so welcoming and helpful throughout the entire process. She is prompt when responding to questions and has been so kind. She has made me feel like a part of the slate creek community without even having been there yet. I have had a lot of questions since I am moving in from out of the area and Kristin has been so kind in answering all of them. Thank you Kristin! I am looking forward to moving into my apartment soon :)< /review>< gmapID>

<Text>Been living here for about 6 months now and love it! The people up front are always super helpful and maintenance is so quick to get to issues. Lots of spaces to take my dog to the bathroom which is nice. Can’t wait to try out some of the amenities now that they’re opening back up!

Also should mention, I don’t have a second car so this isn’t a problem, but I know visitor parking can be tough to find and would be difficult if you had an extra car. But not impossible.</Text><pics>None</pics>< resp>

Mike just came in to fix my AC and fixed sink leak about a month ago. I really appreciate the fact that I made the call less than 3 hours ago and came over super quick to fix. Didn't rush the job at all and took his time while I was home. Very respectful toward my home by wearing a mask and made sure the entrance was announced every time.

Thanks again, Mike!<//Text>

We moved into Slate Creek a few months ago.  We have had such a great experience thus far!  I would like to make mention of Brian from maintenance.  We have  had a few minor issues and every time we call the response is impressively quick!  Brian comes in and handles our issues promptly,  with ease, and a friendly smile.  I appreciate feeling like I can call and not be made to feel like a bother but a priority.  Great job to Brian and his maintenance crew!< /text>

<text>I wish I could zero star this Apt complex. 5-14-2021 Update. I’ve lived here since January 2019. Multiple cars have been stolen, security sits inside the lodge doing nothing at night, and management doesn’t do anything about people not having their dogs on leashes. Overpriced apartments, and they aren’t doing anything about security.

5-24-2021 Update. Management refuses to call me back about security issues. They sent me an email simply saying ‘stop complaining’.</text>< name>

I just had the pleasure of Sam One of the maintenance guys come in and fix my fan in my bathroom. He’s very professional, very polite and my dog absolutely adores him. Anytime Sam does a job he never has to return to redo it so I always have confidence that it’s a job well done. Thank you for having such a great team working for you Sam’s awesome.<//text>

I am a new resident. I moved into my new apartment here 3 days ago. Upon moving in there were some minor repairs that needed to be done that I noticed. When I contacted maintenance they showed up right away to repair what was wrong. Tony and Mike showed up and did an outstanding job. They were very nice and made sure everything was completed the way I wanted it to be. Both these guys are very valuable employees. If it were up to me they deserve a promotion.< /review>

I moved into my 2br 2ba apartment in early March 2021... Kristin Boston (My Leasing Professional) has been absolutely amazing. If I email her with a question he responds almost immediately, if I call her with a maintenance request she is all over it and has someone knocking on my door to help me quickly. Nothing but positivity so far here at Slate Creek Apartments.</review>

I am the General manager of the landscape company who provides landscape services for Slate Creek Apartments. We have dealt with many clients in the apartment industry and cant say enough good things about our experience with the staff at slate creek. The leasing staff in the office is extremely friendly and helpful with all of our team members who they come in contact with. In particular Jessica, the community director is great to work with! She always makes time for me even when I drop in without a scheduled appointment. This is a rare quality given how busy most managers are. When things come up regarding landscape services she is very quick to see them through till completion with excellent turn around time on all proposed services.

Brian, The maintenance supervisor is always willing to go above and beyond to help us help them. Any time he requests service he provides more than enough information and always offers to help anyway he can. all of these things combined make an excellent working relationship between us and Slate Creek Apartments. This amazing team deserves a shout out! Go Slate Creek!< /review>

<Review>Great place but the parking is terrible. I’ve lived at 4 apartment complexes over the years and being charged $20/month for the same parking privileges as any guest is outrageous. There is no overflow lot, several cars don’t move for weeks and residents are forced to hold spots for roommates to avoid driving around looking for 30-45 minutes and parking extremely far away. This place would be 5 stars but the parking has by far been the most frustrating experience here. Also note that water, sewage, and trash will run you about another $100/month, plus fees, which we weren’t told prior to moving in.
Mike in maintenance is great, though.</Review>< pictures>

This afternoon I did a service request online to repair my leaky kitchen sink. Soon after I submitted my request there was a knock at my door. The maintenance man that came was Mike. He is always a friendly face to see throughout the apartment complex.
He was quick and even helped me with another appliance I was having trouble with. Great customer service.</text>

Mike our maintenance man is the best. Extremely responsive always follows up with us as well.  It's good to know that when something inevitably breaks or needs attention to, Mike will be there to get it handled as fast as he can.
These apartments are nice, in a good area, near good schools for kids and teens. Shopping and dining are literally right next to the complex so it's very convenient.
Thanks again Mike for all that you do!!</review>

Parking alone is reason enough to make me wish I'd found somewhere else. Three years I've been here and have had ups and downs with people breaking into cars and stealing things from our patio. However I urge you to NOT rent one of their "Reserved" parking spaces. Not only is someone else parked in it nearly every day, the tow company is one man with one truck who seems to have to handle such a wide area, he's never been able to actually tow anyone from the spot and I've been left walking nearly 30 minutes from the Safeway parking lot to my unit at now 9 months pregnant. Not worth the expensive tab they out on the "Reserved" spots. You're basically paying for selfish people to park in front of a sign telling them they will be "towed" if they are not the renter. With no consequences. Frustrating. Moving as soon as this lease is up. Otherwise, nice area most of the time. Pretty expensive rent for carpet that was already lifting up and dirty when we moved in.< /text>

Maintenance is prompt and effective! Mike has always been helpful, whether it’s to show us how to use our laundry facilities shortly after moving in or fixing a small leak in our kitchen sink, like today. Mike explains the problem and solution clearly and makes sure that everything is in good working order before he leaves. It feels good to know that Mike is just a phone call away. Thanks Mike! :)<//Review>

From the initial tour to half way through our year lease, Slate Creek has been absolutely incredible. The office staff has always been nothing but helpful and understanding. Erica, specifically, went above and beyond to resolve issues we came across with our utilities. I've already referred a few people and one of them moved in and has enjoyed himself as well.

On top of the great communication, the apartments are always well-kept. There are so many beautiful areas within and around the apartments that are great for stress relief. Definitely a great place to be, and I'll be hoping to stay here until I find a permanent home.<//review>

We have lived here for about a year and 1/2. This complex is well maintained and the location is nice, right near the shopping area (walking distance. Every time I need something or have questions the whole front office is so helpful. I would definitely like to thank Erica G. because we transferred from 1 apartment to another and she made the whole transition very smooth and her and I being very busy people I am very thankful. Also, Erica G. has been professional and kind any time I speak with her.

Thank you Slate Creek and Erica!

Shout out to the maintenance people to cuz when I put in a request they are either their the same day or the next.<//review>

<Name>Tyler Evanoff<//Name><Review>I enjoyed my time living in Slate Creek Apartments. The property management here is incredible and everyone is very responsive with any issues that came up. By living in apartment complexes, a lot of things are out of people's control, but the management would always handle issues in the most professional manner, which I greatly appreciated. Specifically, I spoke to Giovanni a handful of times and he was very helpful,  professional, and he even helped me secure an apartment in another complex when I had to move from this area. Caprice was another exceptional manager that listened to my concerns about my security deposit when moving out and she dealt with the situation in the best way possible. I really appreciated her assistance as moving is always a very stressful process! Management always had a positive attitude which goes a very long way when working with so many tenants.

I really liked my actual apartment as well. The rooms are very big and I really like all the appliances inside (dishwasher, washer/dryer.) The amenities were definitely nice and I used the fitness center frequently, which was very convenient for my busy schedule.

The maintenance here never disappointed either. When I put in a work order, maintenance would show up in a timely manner and was able to do fantastic work with no charge. Gloria was very nice and helpful when I did my walkthrough before I moved out as well.

Being a very large apartment complex, it is inevitable that there will be some issues. The biggest one was the parking in Slate Creek. You receive one covered spot as part of your rent (also have to pay a fee for a permit sticker which was odd) and it is very difficult to have guests over as there are not enough parking spots in the complex. Even if you decide to buy another permit for an uncovered parking spot, there is no guarantee that you will be able to find a spot. When I used  guest passes, my guests often times would drive in circles for a very long time and have to walk a couple minutes across the complex to get to my unit.

Overall, I had a positive experience and the management really makes the strongest effort possible to make this place enjoyable for all their tenants.</Review>< Rate>

Everything is great about the apartment except parking. Maintenance is speedy! Especially Mr. Mike. Customer service is wonderful & amenities are amazing 😁 Me and my wife pay for an additional parking spot, but often times are left without a park after coming home from work. This is frustrating enough as it is a constant problem. If a solution can be found to parking this would be a 5 Star Apartment Complex.</Text>

This is a pretty good place. Clean, well-lit, good amenities. Maintenance is fast and polite. They recently renovated apartments to have no carpet, so it can get annoying if you have loud neighbors above you. The area is amazing, all the shopping, parks, and restaurants nearby that you could want. All in all, not bad.<//text>

Mike the maintenance man is amazing!! He’s so fast and works very efficiently. My AC broke and it was so hot but after Mike fixed it, it immensely cooled down. He’s also so nice which is always appreciated when entering my home :)</review>

The maintenance team here is always really nice. When we do have problems they come out and always fix it right away and make other valuable suggestions for the apartment. Shout out to Mike for coming out the last two time and fixing our appliances.</Review>

< Review>
The only reason I have three stars is due to the horrible parking situation. I work until late at night therefor there’s never a chance for me to get a spot (my roommate gets the covered spot). If I’m lucky I’ll find one after 45 minutes of driving around searching. Way too many units and rooms for such a minuscule amount of parking. Other than that we love these apartments. Maintenance is great too. Had some issues with our heating and Mike came by for maintenance the same day we requested it. He got our issue fixed and changed our air filter without us even asking for it! He was in and out in about 30 minutes max.</Review>

We understand that parking can be a challenge, but we do have a tow service available for residents to call if a vehicle is parked in their reserved space.  We have also implemented a new parking plan for residents that limits the number of spaces given to each household.  Overtime, this will decrease the number of vehicles on the property and allow for residents to find an open space with less difficulty.  Due to COVID-19, vehicles are not moving as often, and we are closely monitoring the parking lot  and giving citations to vehicles that appear to be stored, or do not have a parking permit displayed appropriately. Please do not hesitate to reach out to our on-site team at (916)-773-5525 if you have any additional questions regarding parking.

I call slate creek apt because I had a leak and my drain was clogged, and within 10mins of the call, Mike showed up and fixed everything super fast. But it's not surprising, because Mike is the best maintenance man here. Nice and understanding. If you ever have a maintenance problem, Mike is the best one to ask for.. Thanks again Mike for everything!!< /review>

<Review>Lived there years ago. Well kept, modern management ideas. Loved the balcony, pools, tennis courts and gymns. It was as a great community for my children to be safe yet active. Even had my bridal shower/bachelorette in the clubhouse. One of my best living experiences.

For me, as a tenant, it has been about location and the quality of the property. It’s a nice place. I’ve liked living here.
The current management is 100x better than what was here before.

All that said, it’s not perfect. You’re renting and have to deal with parking problems if you have multiple cars in your household. Quick fixes from maintenance instead of proper fixes.

Compared to what else I’ve seen and experienced with renting. I’d recommend Slate Creek to someone who asked my opinion.< /review>

<Text>The grounds are nice and well maintained. Slate Creek is extremely dog friendly. People are very pleasant and apartments are large and well designed. The pools and amenities are not crowded and patronized by nice people with small families. Safety is never a concern. Overall it is a diverse place to live with good people enjoying life.

On the negative, not to blame Slate Creek, but:
1. The neighbors above us fought often. Screaming, threats of violence and once throwing items over the balcony.
2. Marijuana smoke has started to waft from apartment(s)
3. Parking situation is completely unacceptable. It is so bad I often put of trips for fear no parking will be available on return.
4. Although residents have been issued warning after warning for not picking up after their dogs, problem still remains.

I give the place 4 stars because I know Slate Creek tries very hard to provide a good tenant experience. Some things are just out of their control. People will be people :O)<//Text>< pics>

<Review>Slate creek maintenance staff are great. Anytime we have something to be fixed they are quick to respond and always do a great job. We really appreciate Mike who has helped several times to fix things from the screen door to replacing sink faucets. Honestly this is the one apartment complex we have lived where they are proactive about keeping up the complex and do not neglect the maintenance side of things.<//Review>< rate>

I’ve lived here for over 10 years and the management company here now (ConAm) has been the best. The maintenance staff is great and gets things fixed quickly. I really like the staff in the office. They treat everyone like family, not just another tenant. The apartment complex is beautiful with a lot of trees and it’s in a great location. I highly recommend!</Review>

<Review>I’ve lived at Slate Creek for years and I’ve gone through several ownership changes and management changes. The new staff in the office are so nice, polite, and helpful. I usually always get Erica Gonzalez at the front desk has a very friendly attitude, very polite and she’s always dressed very professional. I went through a very hard year healthwise and when I reach out for help her response time is immediate and the first thing she says is how can I help and they always ask how Sterling my dog is doing and they always ask how my health is. Regarding Maintenance  jobs I always get the pleasure of having Sam come over because I actually ask for him because of his professionalism and knowledge on fixing stuff. He gets things done.  When he comes to my door he greets me in a professional manner, his dress attire is clean and he’s very polite and seems to be very knowledgeable on how to fix things. So keep the staff that you have because it’s working for your company.

Mike came to my apartment today to fix my lightbulb and power outlet. He was very professional, kind and quick to fix everything! I'm very happy with my experience, he's a great member of the Slate Creek staff.</text>

They are pretty strict with HOA rules when it comes to patios and front door areas so be aware. Parking can be a disaster but purchasing a parking permit was the best choice we made. I've only had one issue with the property manager in the front office who was very short and rude during a visit, but all of the other associates are always so kind and helpful! We have been here for 3yrs and couldn't find it in us to leave yet as the amenities and pet friendly complex are hard to beat for us.<//text><rate>4</rate><user>116494786373318939684< /user><Date>1595615859455</Date>< gmapID>

The maintenance guy Sam is awesome! I am the mail carrier currently for the apartments and the mail box was broken today. I ran up to get his help and he immediately got tools and handled it efficiently with a smile. He cared about the time I had while working and is always so courteous and friendly. Seeing the maintenance guys is always a great part of my day. Thank you!</text>

<Review>I have lived at Slate Creek since January 2020. We are 6 months in and I hate it here. The only nice thing about this complex (the reason for 2 stars) is the easy accessibility to grocery shopping and gas stations. The majority of other tenants are rude and unfriendly. The water is turned off in our unit constantly ( I am talking a couple times a month). You have to pay to have your car here, yet there is never anywhere to park! Most of the staff is very friendly and helpful, and I understand that they are enforcing rules that corporate has set up, but it is very frustrating to call and not receive an answer to an inquiry. You will pay out your behind to live here, there are constantly costs pop up to get you to pay more! Only move here if you are desperate! Not somewhere I would recommend to move to.<//Review>< pictures>

<Text>I love the apartments and facilities! If you move forward with Slate Creek be SURE TO work with Kristen. She is THE BEST and so willingness to work with others. Giavonni did not give us the best experience on the other hand. We found him insensitive, very difficult to work with, and  lack of understanding in how to serve us OR honor previous agreed upon rent. He constantly tried to raise the price despite our previous conversations. Its was frustrating and we almost backed out completely because of his customer service as he was impersonal and cared less about us as individuals. When we asked if Kristen was in the office, he rolled his eyes back to the paper work and quickly changed the topic by asking us to sign the papers (felt like he didn't like her). It left me with a nasty feeling inside and was an unfortunate experience. In addition, our friends that live there had the same experience with him as we did. Any time we go to the office now, we ask for Kristen. She cares for the people she serves.

When entering into our apartments they were clean and well taken care of. Our friends that just moved in there recommended us, but within one week of them being there, their license plate was stolen.  In addition, we have had no problem with the people living there. We met some of our neighbors in the passing and for the most part they are friendly.

I love how clean the complex stays, and enjoy having our own washer and dryer within our apartment. The apartments are in a good location and everything you need is within a 10min walk or 3min drive, so it feels. Hope this helps anyone looking. To wrap it up, recommend Kristen to help you. She works Wednesdays- Saturdays (I think). She honored our original price and over the phone you can feel her genuine interest in helping you. We had a couple of request such as finding a top floor apartment and she made it happen. We couldn't believe her consistency and follow up. We are really grateful for her.

Mike is also awesome. He is apart of the maintenance team and he quickly solved our leaking sinks. He has a great attitude! I give Mike a 5 star!!< /Text><user>107135136873169259561<//user>< Response>

My roommates and I lived here for almost a year, and if it weren’t for some unfortunate circumstances we would have renewed our lease! The staff was nothing but kind and professional, especially Erica who is one of the managers up at the leasing office. Gloria also was very kind and personable while doing our final walk through upon leaving our apartment. The amenities are amazing and fully accessible! The dog park was our favorite spot and we loved the vibe of this place and will miss it dearly! We did have some noisy neighbors but we got through it! The only real con I have about Slate Creek are the never ending price increases on rent for this complex. The prices just keep getting more outrageous and it leads to lots of residents leaving to find something more affordable. Overall, my experience at Slate Creek was great, just a little bit pricey! We are really going to miss this place!< /text>

Hands down one of the nicest properties I’ve ever been to. This property is close to everything in Roseville but yet it gives you a foothill like setting, with its mature trees and its creek running alongside the property. And to top it off it has the best staff!!< /text>

<text>My water heater went out around 3 AM. I called maintenance emergency and Mike came right out, secured the problem and explained step by step what would take place. He came back at a decent hour, installed a new water heater and had my flooring taken care of all in 1 day. I am experienced in property management and I was truly pleased and impressed with Mike.<//text></record>

The staff here are more than friendly and accommodating. We had a leaking faucet in our shower. Called the main office and explained the situation. Within an hour they sent a maintenance man named Mike who was very kind to our two year old who insisted on watching him preform the job. He was done within 30 min or less. We haven't had a problem since. Our small family absolutely loves this place and would recommend it to friends and family.<//review>

<Review>Moved in a few months ago and so far loving it. Have had to call the maintenance in a few times for small things, but they’ve been extremely prompt and efficient with their work. Was out for the weekend, and the maintenance  technician Sam had fixed the problem and had done as I asked. Felt so good to come home and not have to worry about anything.< /Review>< Pics>

<review>I’m so disappointed and unhappy living here. I recommend nobody moving in and suffering here. The landlords don’t care about you, the neighbors are rude and they will charge you an insane amount of money on top of the basis of what you are paying. The parking is an absolute joke here. The mail person(s) never put packages away correctly and many of my packages have been lost. It’s an absolute joke here. Don’t move in here. Every person I have talked to about when they previously lived here absolutely hated it.</review><Pics>None< /Pics>< gmapID>

The apartment was clean and I am surprised at how quiet it has been.  I took away one star as the stairway area is not as clean.

Absolutely love living at Slate Creek! I lived here before and it was such a great experience that it brought me back. My apartment is a brand new fully-renovated unit and everything was done almost to perfection. Upon move-in, maintenance had a few things to touch up but they were fast and very friendly, major thanks to James for all of his help! If you’re in the market for a new place, I would recommend Slate Creek to anyone!< /review>

I’m a general contractor and I’ve worked with the manager Jessica Burke for the past 4 years across two properties. I can honestly say she is the most competent manager I have ever had the pleasure of working with, her attention to detail and communication is second to none.

<Review>Nobody seems to ever know what is going on around here.  For example, we  put a maintenance request about 3 weeks ago.  The day before the holiday weekend we get an email saying that they couldn't enter without our permission and our phone number was wrong.  Our number has not changed in the 5 years we have been here.  They have called it before and we were home all day that day.  There was no knock on the door.  Yesterday, 1.5 weeks later, we return from vacation and receive an email that everything was fixed.  So much for not entering without permission and everything was not fine.  My husband talk to the office staff who had no idea what was going on.  We got a call that they would be back out today, and they did show up when they said they would.  Afterwards we get a call from the manager that someone will be out sometime today.</Review><pics>None<//pics><time>1594851989852< /time><Gmap_id>0x809b1fd84e2f18ed:0x2ab759b4015b515f</Gmap_id><user>111548311769446702666</user><response>{'time': 1595327321562, 'text': 'Hello Brenda,\nWe are disappointed to hear that you have had a less-than-positive experience while living at Slate Creek.

<rate>5</rate><text>Mike is the best maintenance worker I've had in any of the apartment buildings I've lived in. He came by today to fix our bathtub because it was leaking down below to our downstairs neighbors. While he was here he noticed a sound coming from the toilet and fixed a messed up handle that was getting stuck. Then I mentioned that there's a screw missing from an A/C vent and he fixed that too! He also switched out the A/C filter when he noticed that it was really old and probably wasn't change before we moved in back in February. Now he's replacing the lightbulb above the stove like a boss. He knocked a bunch of small things out which we greatly appreciate! So nice of him to go above and beyond while he was here. Thanks Mike for helping us keep the place running!</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

I've lived here for almost two years now and I love it. The leasing staff are all amazing but Ryan is the best! If I ever have work orders, he makes sure they get entered and completed quickly. He's personable and friendly and even watching him interact with other residents, he remembers things from prior conversations and will ask follow up questions on them. I feel like that's a rare quality in customer service nowadays.<//review>

This apartment complex is a great location with a lot of family-friendly amenities (pools, dog park). The only downside is the limited parking near our building. Sometimes we will have to park all the way across the complex and walk 10 minutes back to our apartment.</review>

We just moved in yesterday from living in some really rough places and we love it! We were worried that we would not be getting all that we saw in the model unit and or be disappointed with things just because we are used to it. Let me tell you, this place delivered everything and more. They care about detail in your unit, our walk through was done so thoroughly we had to actually look for the scratches and things they noted down. Kristin is so nice and made the move in during quarantine extremely easy for us. It is extremely peaceful and we get an amazing breeze. We were living in a ran down apartment in Citrus Heights for the same price as this beautiful newly renovated apartment with an amazing view. If you pick to not live her because of “parking” you are missing out big time.<//Text>

The biggest complaint is whoever designed the place didn’t think out painting all the buildings the same color and then giving us all 2 of every building number regardless of what the street address is. It’s unreal the amount of deliveries and people we have to deal with going to the wrong address and visa versa.  we get wasted door dash meals of others way too often. It’s the most inconvenience thing we have ever had living somewhere. In a day and age where everything is mostly delivered, it’s a very frustrating process and experience.< /Text>

However there is one glaring issue at Slate Creek: the parking situation. We have 2 vehicles and only 1 reserved spot; we are regularly parking across campus and calling each other for pickups/ drop offs (it sounds silly, but there are 40 buildings and the place is friggin huge). The lack of parking is a frustrating nightmare, and perhaps that is what compels other drivers to act like maniacs. [If these were non-issues then I would happily give Slate Creek 5 stars.]

The final point: people drive too fast and there isn't enough parking. If either of these are issues for you, then perhaps consider another location.< /Text>< Rating>

The units are fine, but the management experience leaves much to be desired.  If you do rent from them, they will auto enroll you with their package lockers. This is a paid service, and a hassle to get around. Also, maintenance requests go ignored and they bombard you with unnecessary emails, all while begging for 5 star reviews. For being such an expensive complex, I am disappointed with them and do not intend to renew my lease.<//Text>

We recently had our final walk-through, and I was worried that a larger complex and management company would nickel and dime us in order to keep as much of the deposit as possible, but Gloria was extremely fair and understanding during the walk-through. She was great to work with. Our time at Slate Creek was fair otherwise.< /review>

I really feel like any questions I have are always met with patience and kindness since I'm always trying to be sure I follow expectations and so because of my lovely experience here, I highly recommend anyone move here!

<review>If I could give these apartments no stars I would. The apartments themselves are nice upgraded but dealing with the leasing office is terrible. We constantly have notices on our front door over petty things. For example we were asked to take our patio light down because they could see them from the parking lot. Mind you we are on the third floor. Rent here is 1700 and we can’t decorate patios or apartments your own way. If your causing damage to the property then I understand but we had outdoor lights then were rarely on. To top it off they make you pay an extra 20 dollars for parking. There’s no parking here I constantly have to park either on the other side of the apartment complex. I’m definitely ready to get my lease over and done with and find somewhere else.</review>< pictures>

<Pictures>None< /Pictures><Text>I’ve been a resident here for 7 months. I pay an additional $20 each month for parking, which I’d understand if the apartment complex Actually bothered to create more parking spots. If you get home past 4pm chances are you won’t find parking, or will have to park on the opposite side  of your apartment site. I parked my car (which is registered under my apartment number) for about 20min in a no parking parking zone because I couldn’t find a nearby parking spot. Honestly I had an emergency and had to use the restroom. I come out and my car’s gone. A warning would of been nice, considering we’ve been Quarantined for a while and the financial situation of most people isn’t so great given the circumstances. I was leaving my apartment this morning and saw the tow truck driving around the apartment complex, so I’m sorry to whom ever got their car towed this morning! My Roomate and I terminated are lease early and i’m excited to get out of these horrible apartments.</Text>< Time>

Their customer service, is far and beyond while corporate controls things, but they do their best. I really hate how slate creek runs the parking- it’s the most annoying thing about living in these apartments. I feel they don’t care if only one resident has three or two cars. Bc that one resident leaves a car parked for more than several days and they create a problematic problem to rest of the residents and their parking. Second, I feel their upper management or corporate people are very rude. While I been experienced to have work in upper management and even Costco management, Slate creek apartment management  are the most rudest management style. However, people like Erica or Gloria, they work there and they do their best even though they can’t control or over ride management. Gloria is a hard working lady for the staff on the grounds and for the maintenance, while Erica is the nice one in the office & maybe office manager position, and even if she can’t make everyone happy, she listens at least and respects the residents. So there are pros and cons for living at Slate Creek. One thing for sure, it’s too damn big and full and hard to keep up with. So you can’t always blame the office people. At the same time, I think if it was a different corporate running with different management style, it would be more professional with a level of respect, even if there is a disagreement. I have had the blessings to know how to have bosses that you disagree with but still have a mutual respect. I wish Slate creek had that. So three stars for those who do work hard there and yet, their upper management professional style is not quite there or corporate. Yes, it’s big and the parking sucks.</Review><gmap_id>0x809b1fd84e2f18ed:0x2ab759b4015b515f</gmap_id><userid>111460385407657891365< /userid><Pictures>None</Pictures>< rate>

I had a work order in this morning for my water heater not heating up and I spoke to Kristen and Erika about it. They were great and understanding and although it was close to closing on Valentines Day they asked James to come over before his shift finished to take a look he was so nice and quick and fixed the problem immediately. I am very satisfied with my service and how fast they got the problem solved.<//review>

The apartment was in poor conditions when we first moved in. We got charged for items that were damaged before we first moved in. Because of COVID we had to relocate and still had to pay an early lease breakage fee. The manner in which management dealt with issues caused by COVID was poor. We had to dispute charges that were completely unfair.< /Review>

We chose Slate creek apartments because of their central location and decent rent price at the time. We lived here while we had our home built. Maybe my opinion is jaded as I like being a homeowner. However, we had so many frustrations with parking, creaky floor above us, smokers (of all sorts), nosy neighbors with barking dogs, neighbors not picking up after their dogs (in the playgrounds), shutting off our water very frequently for repairs/upgrades on other units in our building, taking away amenities due to COVID 19 and not crediting back for doing so, our refrigerator giving out our final week. The list goes on and on. I will not recommend Slate creek to anyone< /Review>

One day you may wake up founding out that there is no water running in your appartment. Just like it happened to me and my kids today and many other residence. There is not enough maintenance I guess and/ or poor management since we have been with out water running home for about five hours now and who knows when it will start running again.
Be aware that Slate Creek has one maintenance  person, from what they told me this month, during the weekends for about 650 Appatmnets.</Text>

This place is awful my mom is in her 70's and her air conditioner doesn't work properly. She has called the maintenance several times and they don't do anything. I went over to her apartment last night at 8:30pm and it's was 90°in her apartment. She said her air has been on all day. It's just ridiculous this place has no regards for humanity.

Great community ‼️ Love my unit not sure why everyone had bad things to say about the complex. It’s safe and very quiet. Maintenance is always here a few days after work order is put in. Yes parking is a nightmare but everyone has a parking stall assigned to them and there’s visitors parking just limited after a certain hour. Im very l happy I chose Slate Creek...❤️ It’s convenient location has all kinds of stores and restaurants I mean it will blow you’d mind lol...
Oh & Eric was gr8 she made it happen for me to call this place my home<//Review>

<review>I currently live here as of 1/20/2020 and I would consider looking else where if you have more than one car. The parking here is absolutely horrible. They charge you $25 monthly for one covered spot that is designated as yours. But for the uncovered spots you have to pay for a sticker that is $20. That sticker does not guarantee you a spot only lets you park on the property without being towed. If you are not parked by at least 5pm the chance of finding a spot are fairly slim due to the excessive amount of cars compared to available free spots. Most of the time I drive around for 10 minutes looking for an open spot anywhere in the complex and may spend 5 minutes walking to my actual apartment if the spot isn’t near it. They do not keep track of who has a sticker and rarely mark or tow vehicles if they do not have one.<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>{'time': 1580185702895, 'text': 'Hello,\n\nThank you for taking the time to leave us a review.

We lived there for a year and a half. By the time we left they were on the third management company. However, the current one ConAm) has been the best by far. Apartments are nice, maintenance always done well. ConAm has been making improvements to the grounds where other managements companies had failed. All in all, I’d definitely recommend it to someone in search of an apartment.</text>

For the amount you pay here the service provided for maintenance is bad. Management should have the manpower when you have this many units, however we have to wait 5 days to get  a simple padding done for the closet, caused by a/c leak. And the reason: my problem wasn't important enough!!!
Provide the service deserved for the amount that is being paid!!!< /Review>

In the 6.5 years I lived there, the staff was horrible, there was no parking, they did nothing about fixing their rundown "recently renovated" appliances, and continuously raised the rent. I would honestly give it a 0 if that was an option. If you need an apartment, look up the street near the college. 100x better.</Review>

There was a leak in the plumbing above our bathroom that took 2 weeks for the property to fix, and the professionalism of the staff was terrible.  Their first attempt to fix the leak didn't work, and when they came back for the second fix the maintenance crew left a mess in our tub for the contractor to clean up.  They left a hole in our ceiling and didn't even bother to communicate with us what their plan to fix the problem was, and after multiple calls I finally went to the office to pry the information out of their staff.
Downgrading to 1 star.  There are often unsupervised children in the gym, people drive very fast through the property, parking is very limited and the ceilings are so thin you can hear just about every step of your upstairs neighbor.</Text>

<Text>I have lived here for a little over a year and a half, and love it for the most part. The complex is beautiful and well maintained. My apartment has new appliances and attractive finishes. We have had to call maintenance a few times but they have been quick to respond. The walls aren’t paper thin, so I never hear my neighbors. I love being able to walk to the neighboring shopping center. Parking can be an issue, but honestly parking is an issue for pretty much every apartment complex. Also, for the people complaining that there is no recycling — in the City of Roseville everything goes in the same bin and they sort out the recyclables for you. So, yes there is recycling everywhere in the city, just no recycling bins.</Text><user>102745754781621271399</user></record>

5 stars!! Slate creek is by far the best place I've been a resident that I have lived apartment wise! The area is great the neighbors are great! But most of all the administration is wonderful!! I would recommend anyone to live here! I have a history of grandmal seizures and cant drive due to the fact.. it's great because its unbelievably close everything everything I would need. What I really love though is the administration reps in the office. They're all very friendly and very patient. My favorite person that has helped me through thick and thin has been amazing! Her name is Erica.G she has been a more than great/tremendous help shes very sweet and very helpful. She in my opinion needs a raise.. she has worked with me on many many occasions and has been with a helping hand. Erica at slate creek apartment has my full gratitude and respect. And because if her and her team I have had a very wonderfull time here, this Because of her caring, persevering, gentle, bright intelligent, yet very professional personality. She is a more than wonderfull person and I'm glad I had the opportunity to do business with slate creek just by her efforts alone. I recommend her for any job big or small. So thank you erica for all the amazing things you do and did. Keep striving for success! And thank you slate creek for a wonderfull experience and example of what a more than amazing, wonderful, great, employee so thank you erica!</text>

I lived here for six years, and went through four management companies, three of which were in a one year time period. This place is a nightmare in many ways. A lot of the buildings are in bad shape, which is evidenced by one building being basically out of commission because of fires in the building. Maintenance doesn't respond to calls immediately, but you can always see them hanging around their garage having loud conversations when they ought to be working. Management is not in contact with the security patrol, so be prepared to inform them of complaints because management doesn't bother to look at the logs. Car break-ins and police presence are prevalent, so protect your valuables. Also, speeding is a BIG problem, so avoid walking in the parking lot with earbuds, and look numerous times before pulling out of your space. The extra star in this review is for the close proximity to stores. Other than that, spend your money elsewhere for someplace to live.< /text>

We appreciate your patience as we work diligently to remediate the damage and make sure it represents the high level of quality ConAm prides itself on.\nWe are also taking measures throughout the community to address any leak problems and to take care issues that could potentially cause leaks in the future. However, to thoroughly address the concerns of our residents, we may need to shut off the water while repairs are taking place. It is our aim to make sure that our efforts have long-standing results, so we can avoid any future problems.\nWhile bike riding in the parking lot is against our community rules, we do have many areas for our younger residents to enjoy. We have 2 playground areas, several picnic areas, an activity center and pool, plus 2 basketball courts and a tennis court. We really enjoy when we see our residents enjoying all our Slate Creek amenities.\nThank you very much for taking the time to provide us with feedback, we assure you that we take improvement very seriously and have made the on-site team aware of your review.

<Review>Okay place to live. Would like there to be recycling. The staff can be friendly at times, but I have lived here for 4 months and they still won't give the mail man a "code" he needs for the package locker room and they haven't fixed our RentCafe, which means we can't pay online like we would like to. Nobody in the office seem to want to help me, or maybe they just don't know what is going on because of the new staffing going on. But it is very frustrating. Would like to see that change SOON. But the community is very nice.<//Review>< user_name>

<Text>I would give zero stars if it was possible. The staff is horrible. They don’t care about anything but screwing the residents. The option on their phone number for residents to call goes straight to a voicemail number. The parking situation is horrible. And finally, during the move out inspection the lady essentially said they were going to rob me of my deposit, which they sure did! I have lived in a few apartment communities and have never had so much of my deposit taken from me. They robbed me of almost $500 when I left the apartment absolutely spotless! I will NEVER recommend this community. I should have listened to the horrible reviews they have earned!</Text><UserId.>105611290159305513741< /UserId.>< resp>

<review>This is my third year in the complex. Every thing was very good, comfortable and satisfied in the first two years. When the new owner came, everything changed. Every day there are new rules like insurance , parking , pets.

Now the policy of parking dose not allow you to have more than two cars, also you only can have 5 vistor (means that only 5 people can visit you every month). If you have more than 5 visitors or you have more than two cars, you have to park by the safway.<//review>< resp>

This was the worst place to live ever! I would rather live in a cardboard box than deal with the horrible management, the continuous construction, and the non gated entrances. My motorcycle was stolen from here, and there is at least one car that gets broken into every night. No security cameras either. All the thieves from around know this and come here to steal. I caught the "security" guard sleeping in his truck one night coming home from the bar. Good luck getting hold of the maintenance people as well. They are cool dudes but the task to get them to you is a great one indeed. I could go on about more negative facts. Bottom line, don't rent here unless you want to get raped financially.</Text>

I did see a few five star reviews, but those were clearly done by staff since they only have one review total and verbage sounded very sales-ish.< /review></record>

I really liked the layout of the property and it's location to the many businesses.  I searched online and found them. They advertised the Clover at $1479.  This was the floor plan I was interested in.  We went in (as a walk in with no prior information given), they said the cheapest 2 bdrm they had was the Clover at $1575. I asked what other plans did they have and prices. She asked what did I mean, then said this is the cheapest one. They didn't give any further information.  It was as if they wanted to pick what one I should have.  At this point, I'm not interested.  I go home and look up the units again to see if I made a mistake. The Clover is still being offered at $1479 (avail 4/2) and the Marigold is being offered at $1569.  Both of these are below $1575.  I do not feel they are upfront.  I do feel she purposely set the prices higher and did not divulge further information, because her intentions were to lock in that one apartment at an elevated cost. If there is already issues with honestly in the beginning, I'm not going to enter any further.  I'm not going to argue or prove a point. It's not worth it.. Literally.   Do your homework before you go in.</Review>

<Review>Slate Creek is NOT safe. If you care for your family's safety and your property you will not come here.

The four wheels of my car were stolen at Slate Creek (check the pictures). The police mentioned that this was not an isolated incident. Other neighbors were victims of crime in the past months.

Anyone can come in to Slate Creek and do whatever they like without fear of consequences. There are no security cameras on site, no gates, and I have never seen a security guard on the premises.

Slate Creek is no man's land for thieves, robbers, and criminals. If they had enough time to steal all four wheels of car without any trouble, they know they can commit any crime in this unprotected place.

Do not bring your family to Slate Creek. It is not safe.<//Review>< Pictures>

The walls are so thin that you hear people cough in the middle of the night. The only thing I liked about this wretched place is that I get to move soon! Do not move in here, they will take your soul. If you want to be happy when you get off work and get to come home, do not move here! They tell you they need 60 days notice to move out, even with a signed year lease date end and then notify you of that 60 days 30 days before the lease is up... make sense? No, they are trying to screw you because then you have to pay month to month which is an additional $400!

I'm living for over 3 years here. I was complaining to management about water leak in the bathrooms and  walls turn black from the mold. It took a year for them to have somebody come and fix it. Outside the community appears to be nice, but management sucks.< /text>

Honestly, this place sucks. The staff, management company, and rules are literally constantly changing. My first apartment came with a heavy downstairs smoking neighbor which aggravated my asthma SO BAD that I refused to stay in that unit. I moved to another unit- completely NOT the floor plan I had originally signed up for, as the new unit they allowed me to move to was smaller in size. I thought my problems were finally over, but now (a few years later) this unit must have mold or something because myself and any visitors begin to have congestion, coughing, sneezing, itchy eyes. I am SO THANKFUL my lease ends next month, I literally HATE going home because it is torture to have to live in a unit that is causing respiratory issues AGAIN. And of course no one answers the phone, and the online portal isn't working. Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere.<//Review>

Nine years ago, this was a nice, clean, safe community, with good amenities and a very good management.
Since the new management(s) came in, the complex is going down the drain at warp speed.
Maintenance is totally unresponsive, security is non-existent (I called them once, and they told me "We'll be there in around 40 minutes").
So... In the summer there are a lot of people coming to the pools from the neighboring streets. Nobody to check if you are a tenant or not.
There used to be an activity center that has been shut down, and the former management used to throw parties for the tenants (Many would find this irrelevant, but it's the thought that counts). No more activity center or parties, here. Just pay the rent and shut up, you have no rights. And if you call the office, you are treated like an idiot, with a total lack of respect.
The new colors of the building, then, did the final touch, bringing the bright and warm tones of brown to a gloomy and cold dark mold green that does everything it can to be depressing.
Totally, totally bad. Never been in a place worse than this.
And it's clear that the management doesn't care AT ALL about the residents by simply looking at the total lack of dust control during the renovations. CLOUDS of dirt that could be avoided by simply using the FREE recycled water that the City of Roseville offers for just this purpose.
HORRIBLE! DO. NOT. LIVE. HERE.
Unfortunately, it's impossible to give ZERO or negative stars.<//text>

<Review>My advise to anyone who doesn't live here and is thinking about it, THINK AGAIN. DO NOT LIVE HERE! They don't care about the residents and they are only focused on getting leases signed, but once you sign it you are basically dead to them now since your stuck here. (if you want to leave early, they'll charge you $3000 to break your lease regardless of how much time you have left.) Having a problem in your apartment? TOO BAD! you will have to put in a minimum of 3 requests to get anything done and it will most likely be at least 2 weeks or longer before the problem gets fixed, if it ever does. They like to completely ignore problems too.

We lived here for 13 months and we had the water heater leak and need to be replaced then when they replaced it we had no hot water for months until they came out 3 separate times to finally get it, the master toilet leaked everywhere and we had to call multiple times and have them come out twice to tell us nothing was wrong until my husband pointed out exactly where the leak was and what needed to be done and then they were able to fix it, the spare bedroom closet door broke off the hinges just by opening it, the refrigerator was so old it wasn't keeping cold and it took them almost a month to replace it after having them come out and look at it 4 different times, the dryer broke and my roommate actually ended up fixing that one because we put in requests and it never got fixed, the AC didn't work and they tried to blame it on the single pane windows. It wasn't until after I submitted the third work order and included pictures and threatened to complain to the property management company that they finally called the AC guy to come out and he said it needed to be replaced because it was so old and wasn't working.

I'm not even going to get into the parking, because there just isn't any. My friends usually have to park in the Safeway parking lot and walk when they come over unless I leave my car port open, if I can even find a spot open.

Need to call the office for something? TOO BAD! they don't answer the phone either so you have to do everything electronically or physically go down to the office and wait forever until they are done with all the people who are looking to live there.

Being a resident here is like being at the bottom of the list. New business is always top priority. It's more headaches than it's worth to live here. Everything is super cheap quality and just falls apart, it's just not worth it. Especially for the high rent prices you have to pay. Save your sanity and rent somewhere else.

Oh and when you move out they will nickel and dime you for everything and they don't provide any proper documentation as required by law. They gave us two estimates for the carpet from 2 different companies. One of the estimates they included for the carpet was dated a year and a half before we even lived there and they had whited out areas and photocopied it so many times that it was that horrible grainy, gray color.

IT"S NOT WORTH IT PEOPLE!! They will be so nice and accommodating when you are a prospect and manipulate you into thinking its such a great place. But please listen to my warning. You will be SO much better off just steering clear from this place.I don't want what we experienced to happen to anyone else if I can avoid it. No one deserves that. Please listen to the Yelp reviews. I wish I had, It would have saved me so much time that I wasted fighting with them and being angry and hating my home.</Review>< pictures>

I wished I had read these reviews prior to leasing here.  I’ve had very similar complaints.  Every time I call for maintenance It takes sooo long for things to get done.  Apparently since management has changed AGAIN (twice since I’ve been here; I’ve only been here since September) all of the previous work orders/requests are nowhere to be found.  Different computer system.  It took 3 months for them to change a lightbulb.  I realize that’s not an emergency by any means and I certainly wouldn’t have minded doing it myself but the ceilings are so high.  A FEW of the maintenance crew are great James (the new YOUNG one) and Daniel (which no longer work there) I asked them for things they get them done promptly no if ands or buts.  My AC isn’t working and I had James come out, he did the protocol and determined that the unit is the oldest there and it needed to be replaced.  3 OTHER GUYS LATER, they determined I need a new unit.  Ugh duh James had already said so.  So I’m currently using a portable AC unit which the complex supplied which was nice and it stays about 75 now.  It was 88 for days!!  Parking IS an issue ESPECIALLY since the maintenance staff use the spots in front of our building; I’ve asked them to move bc WE PAY for our parking the response was “well where do you want us to park?”  Not my problem buddy!!  Other safety issues I had addressed w maintenance were ones like outside lights on stairwells.  James to the rescue again- he kept the complex from a possible law suit should someone have fallen down the stairs.  Had a door hanging off the hinges for two weeks James came in and in less than 10 minutes he fixed the door and the guest bathroom toilet.  I have yet to have issues w my personal property being damaged, unless the idiot on the Ducati dings my car. Ugh you can’t pick your neighbors- unfortunately.  MOST are great and are there if you need help.  It’s pretty quiet w the occasional fire engine...  I do love the size of my apartment which makes it hard to leave. Some nights I do see security and actual police patrol so I feel safe.  Lots of pros but definitely more cons.  You have to decide for yourself.  Can you put up w the non sense?  If not I cannot suggest moving here.  If you’re handy and can do your own maintenance then certainly

07/17/2019 just an update.  AC issue WAS fixed temporarily I’m back to using the portable after a “brand new” unit was installed.  It worked for 10 minutes literally after the crew (who was great- obviously do not work for slate creek outside vendors) left it quit working.  Luckily I got the crew to come back and the crew manager stayed after troubleshooting it and getting to to work great, also had him check the breakers bc one of them had mentioned the load being too large for my breaker box.  Checked out fine.  It worked for a couple of days amazingly well, then I came home to a hot dog again.

I posted a nasty review on Facebook and surprise guess who called me in the morning?? Yes SLATE CREEP (NOT a typo) leasing office.

James to the rescue ONCE AGAIN!! EVERYTHING that I mentioned(that I could remember as LOTS of little things hadn’t and still haven’t been fixed to this day) to the girl in the leasing office was fixed and the temp was great!!

It’s going on two weeks since the last time it quit working.  I had to go to the leasing office to beg for a portable I was willing to haul it up the 3 flights of stairs myself “just give it to me!”  Dave in the maintenance office (he’s rude and lazy idk what his particular problem is) BUT...he DID bring it to me shortly after I saw him- THAT DAY!  THATS AMAZING service on their scale since they usually suck.

Then....I get a notice on my door last night that I owe them money; no explanation of what for...NOTHING!!  Ok so it is NOT rent related what could I possibly owe over $50 for?? The package locker??? Parking (YES WE PAY FOR SHTY PARKING, and locker packages which means I got to carry a weight bench up 3 flights of stairs by myself and had to pay to do that 😂

Nice apartment community, what impressed me more then anything else, is the service I received from the management and staff. I was offered a discount on my deposit, even without requesting, (it was not a posted discount), and when the apartment size I had, turned out not to work out for me, they happily switched me to another size, without affecting my lease contract. Dianne, Nichole and Arlene all truly showed to have gone out of their way to help me out. Thank you.<//Review>

DO NOT LIVE HERE!!! ---- I am not over exaggerating... LOOK FOR SOMEWHERE ELSE TO LIVE.  I feel comfortable saying that I am a reasonable and "easy to please" person, but Slate Creek Apartments has pushed me to frustration and anger levels I have never been to before. Do yourself a favor and read the the reviews before you waste you're time with them. I can't even be bothered to explain all the problems I have with them, plus I don't want to be too specific because unfortunately I still live here and have to deal with the INCOMPETENCE of the leasing staff until my contract is up. I read all the other reviews, and I'll I can say is that I agree with all the NEGATIVE ONES 100%.< /Review>

I got a rat in my apartment.
I have two kids and it is very scary now to stay save in the appartment. They charge too much to break the lease - I am stuck in here till the end of my lease. I have been leaving here for almost 8 years and now with the new management some new issues keep coming up. Seems like the pet control is not being maintained properly - is only one of them.< /review>

<username>Michael Aldrich< /username><date>1438999619234<//date><rate>2</rate><text>They wanted $2250 as a down payment simply because we had no rental experience as a team... yeah that's right, they didn't care if we each had individually good rental history, we had to show rental history as a group. When I told them they were our first choice but the deposit was obscene, they said they would get back to us within 2 days to let us know what kind of deal they could work with us. Never heard back. Ended up finding a house at about the same price, and 200sqr.ft. larger for almost half the down payment. Look elsewhere, you'll find better.</text>< pics>

<text>Same with the other lady if i could give it 0 stars i would
been here for 2 months and can’t wait to move the hell out of here
this place sucks if you have other options go for it this is by far the worst place i ever lived in my life and they want 1800 a month
The garbage is nasty way to many people use it over flowing and everywhere i seen a dead rat on the 4th day i moved here
my neighbors found roaches in her apartment so i had to go to home depot to get spray to do my patio and out side of my front door
There is no storage whats so ever cabinets are way to small can’t even use them
The front office people are a joke and the manager is rude and unprofessional
So please stay far away from this place spend your money somewhere else<//text><gmapID>0x809b1fd84e2f18ed:0x2ab759b4015b515f</gmapID>< Pictures>

The front office staff does not pick up or return phone calls during business hours which I am still waiting for a return phone call from last week. The maintenance department does not answer the emergency phone number as well which I still to this day have never received a call back. The maintenance department manager told his crew to just wipe the mold off my wall and call it fixed which is not fixing the problem. It took them a month to finally get someone to come fix the mold issue. The maintence supervisor told me that the problem was my issue and I needed to deal with it myself. I know do not have power in part of my apartment for almost a week and the maintenance emergency line still never picked up or called me back to fix the problem and now they don't know what the problem is and told me I have to week until the end of the week for an electrition to come out. The front office staff is not very good with customer service cause when I went into the office to get these problems taken care of the person I talked to responded with "life is tough get over it".< /review>

<Text>Good location and lots of trees. New management company is far beyond terrible. They never answer the phone. They create issues to force out long time tenants obviously to re-lease at higher rent fee. Lots of add on fees upping rents by $100 average. Don't let the nice looking grounds fool you. The buildings are old and noisy. Insect problems and mold forms easily. Facilities have been closed and the sounds of the trash bins being dragged across the property to a compactor are horrific. Now prohibited from putting flowers, bird feeders or anything decorative on your patio. Prohibited from decorating your front door even though the concrete landings are dirty and stained. The new mgmt has ruined this place. It is not a peaceful home anymore.< /Text>< Pics>

This place is okay at best. The repairs they are doing have taken way way too long to do and they still aren't done right. They have now raised the rent twice and the place keeps getting worse. People's cars are having the tires stolen (two instances posted in the photos). Management will only come out if there is a water leak related issues once you get a hold of them. Thin walls allow you to hear everything if your neighbors are loud, kids allowed to be very loud out side early in the morning. Half Naked guy was at the pool once and teenagers sometimes smoke pot in areas that's no smoking .< /text>

I have not lived here but was interested in their apartments. NOT ANY MORE.. They have the WORST customer service i have ever experienced. When i called to schedule an appointment we booked a time and they told me over the phone they had a show apartment that me and my boyfriend can take a look at and walk through. When we arrived they acted like we were walk ins, and claimed to have no apartments to show. Me and my boyfriend are both 20 and they absolutely age discriminated against us and acted like we didn't have the money to be living there. (Never judge a book by the cover, we are in the position currently to buy a house, but kept our options open) We were so appalled we didn't even want to hear anything they had to say. We then left and i continued to get 2 calls every single day asking for our interest even though i asked them twice to take me off their call list. Seems to me like they are a little stuck up. Never would i ever give them the second chance to earn our business!  The only reason i gave 1 star is because Google makes me and they seemed to have a clean property from the little bit that i saw at the front entry.< /text>

They have gone through multiple management changes in the short time I've been there and all of them are quite terrible. This complex will do whatever they like without notifying tenets when they need to do something but when you need something it's "you're on the list."

Between loud and noisy neighbors to maintenance staff that will break things in your apartment and track mud in while doing so, and a management that doesn't care about their reputation, and the fact they raise the rent every year to astronomical amounts... BEWARE of SLATE CREEK.

There are so many issues with this place that we've had over the years this wall o text would be huge if I wrote them all down.

I will say this, they are not all bad, but the bad far outweighs the good hence the 1 star review. If I were you, avoid slate creek and avoid any FPI managed properties, there are a lot so be aware a beware.</review><Rating>1< /Rating>< pics>

Staff never calls you back anymore and if you get a live person, they will refer you to the manager who doesnt exist. No one takes accountablility anymore. The buildings are falling apart.  There are nicer places around this area. Taking our money where a landlord actually will take care of your concerns, and finally my lease is up:)</Text>

This place is absolutely the worst nice place I've ever been. It's pretty nice  trees tall pine trees with pretty blooming flowers areas for your pet however that's the only nice thing about it. The management staff is not incredibly friendly and when you have an issue andneed something addressed they played off brush it off like it's important but don't really do anything or follow up on any issue. There are loud neighbors with barking large dogs that should not be allowed in the complex due to weight restrictions and or volume restrictions I'm talking hundred + pound dogs.  The grounds are kept fairly decent however a lot of maintenance such as trash and pet waste pick up is not enforced. But by far the absolute worst thing about this complex which I can't wait to leave and I've only been here a few weeks is the parking it's beyond atrocious. I am moving out of here and would not stay even a full year just because of the parking.  So if you or your household has more than one vehicle at all times don't ever expect a place to park I actually had to park in the local grocery store parking lot because there were zero spots available in this complex. Do yourself a favor and do not move in and lock your self down in the lease I cannot wait to find i'm Mark Taylor residential property to move into they are way better . And the pictures posted all 60+ of of them posted are fake they flooded with a whole bunch of pictures so no one can fill truly what it looks like.</Review>

<text>Poor to Fair is too polite for this place. More like Horrible. The only thing good about this place is the location. That's it.

Expect to be up at the crack of dawn each day seeing as Maintenance does landscaping and leaf-blowing at around 7 am each day. They'll also use your power outlets for their high-powered equipment, making your electricity higher. In addition, I caught them red-handed PURPOSELY blowing leaves UP onto my porch! They don't care, and they also don't speak English. If you ever need them to fix something in the apartment you can forget about it, they'll never come unless you hound the main office everyday for three weeks. Things are broken or made to break easily in the apartment, there's mold everywhere water comes from, and the cabinets are crap.

Management will NEVER help you! That is a fact! They are all extremely rude and never do what they say they'll do unless you hound them and even then they don't care. They will screw you out of your money anyway they can. TAKE PICTURES OF BEFORE AND AFTER YOU MOVE IN if you are dumb enough to actually live there. They are notorious for not giving back deposits. When we finally moved out we were told they would do the carpet cleaning and bill us later for it. We were shocked when we got a bill totaling over $1000. They had decided to COMPLETELY REPLACE the entire carpet instead of just cleaning it and tried to stick us with the bill!

Don't ever be surprised if they try to up your rent after you move in! They tried that a couple of times, (which is illegal btw) I resolved it pretty quickly by reminding them we signed a contract that had the discussed price on it, that they cannot legally charge more than what is stated on the lease agreement. In addition, they will also try to make you pay HOA which is ALSO illegal to do.

As an after-note, ask about the building that was on fire, which one it was and ask for more information about it. You'll notice how they'll avoid the subject and never give you a specific answer. They had to legally shut down the building for 6 months. You'll also notice the dog crap that's everywhere too, look out for it!

Overall, never live here. You will most definitely regret it!</text><Rating>2< /Rating><pics>None< /pics><date>1350675905923</date></record>

Not happy here, it's unfortunate. Don't waste your time or money.  Office staff are rude if you do get a hold of them, you put in a maintenance request and no one shows up.  Two offices only one open, two exercise rooms only one open, people pull in off the road and deal drugs in the complex and there is no security who patrols the parking lot.<//text>

WORST PLACE I HAVE EVER LIVED!!! The rent is a ridiculous! Not to mention utilities and the place falls apart when you move in. Also when something breaks when they come to fix it they don't fix the problem they make it worse! Not to mention my luck but the sh** hole apartment i was blessed with is haunted!!!!! i give this apartment complex 10 thumbs down! Cant wait to move.</Text>

<Text>These apartments suck. Their maintanence department is the worst, had to keep contacting the leasing office and bug them to come out for 2 months! Another thing about the management, we caught one of the office attendants trying to pocket a money order for the rent! Shady! Also, there is no parking and people constantly get towed. The walls in the Apartments are not insulated well, you can hear neighbors and up and downstairs. Finally, 3 times a week in the morning, the maintanence people tow the dumpsters like they are a train, they usually do it at 7 so if you have a Monday or Friday off, don't plan on sleeping in. These dumpster trains are louder than regular trains. Also their two half gyms are worthless just like their activity center which closes at 5pm. Worst apartments ever.

The only plus side is that it is walking distance from Safeway and many other local eats.<//Text>< Gmap_id>

<user_name>Roselle Bazzanella</user_name><time>1497178287746<//time><rate>1<//rate><Text>I would honestly give this apartment community and its management a below zero rating. They charge random amounts for utilities, varying month to month and you never receive a paper billing to show the actual legitimate charges that are in fact your own. Maintenance requests are never completed. Someone may come once but never come back. If the fridge stops working and you immediately report it to maintenance and they dont feel like being bothered you could lose hundreds of dollars in groceries and receive no compensation for such. They charge an extra monthly fee for supposed renters insurance. They dont provude any information on coverage amount carrier or claim information. If damage does occur out of your control nothing is covered under this malignant policy management gives you no choice but to pay. Management is disinterested in your safety as your front door may not close properly or lock correctly to the point you have to set a garbage can inside of it just so it sppeats to be closed from the outside. You have to try to sleep that way knowing anyone at anytime could enter. You tell maintenance. you tell management. no one comes. no one cares. especially if they decide they dont like you. You dont get cable or wifi, the smoke alarms are dismantled and the single sorinkler unit for fire control isnt even completely there. there are no bedroom doors, the cabinet doors fall off the hinges, the drains dont drain the the tubs, the hot and cold water works backwards and there isnt one free spot for guest parking from early evening on. And im just getting warmed up.< /Text>< Pics>

POSSIBLY THE WORST RUN MANAGEMENT COMPANY EVER. I AM A CURRENT RESIDENT IN ROSEVILLE AT SLATE CREEK APARTMENTS.

1) NEVER EXPECT SAMANTHA THE MANAGER TO CALL YOU BACK  IVE LEFT MULTIPLE MESSAGES AND EVERYTIME IVE TRIED TO REACH HER IM TOLD "SHES NOT AVAILABLE AND WE DONT KNOW WHEN SHE WILL BE" - CAN YOU BE THAT BUSY??

2) IT TOOK THEM OVER 3 MONTHS TO HANDLE MY LEASE CONTRACT TO UPGRADE FROM 1 UNIT TO THE NEXT, WHICH WOULD HAPPEN AT THE END OF MY OLD LEASE.

3) ALL OF MY PAYMENTS ARE AUTOMATIC (AUTOMATIC FOR WHATEVER THE MONTHLY BALANCE IS FOR INCLUDING SOME UTILITIES)  AND THERES NEVER BEEN AN ISSUE WITH PAYMENTS - I CAME HOME TONIGHT TO A NOTICE SAYING I HAVE A PAST DUE BALANCE ON A UNIT I HAVENT EVEN BEEN IN FOR A MONTH AND THAT I RUN THE RISK OF MY LEASE BEING TERMINATED OVER $45. I OBVIOUSLY PAID THE DEPOSITS BEFORE MOVING AND THEN RENT WAS AUTOMATICALLY DEDUCTED AND OUT OF MY BANK ACCOUNT ON THE 3RD AND SOMEHOW 10 DAYS LATER IM BEING THREATENED TO BE KICKED OUT FOR SOME PAST DUE BALANCE, WHICH ISNT EVEN LISTED ON WHAT THAT BALANCE IS!!!!

NO WONDER THIS COMPANY HAS HORRIBLE REVIEWS EVERYWHERE<//Review>

This apt. complex is way overpriced for run down apts.  They have horrible management service that cannot keep records straight.  They are rude, unprofessional and ridiculously overpriced.  They should get a zero star, but I have to give them one.</Review>

<Review>My husband and I have lived here since September 2013. We live in a 2bd/2br unit on the third floor (with wonderful vaulted ceilings). Our move in consultant was Nora, who kept in close contact with me throughout the process of applying and submitting all of our paperwork. She continues to this day to be accountable and reliable, not just someone who secures a new resident and then moves on. We did have a "punch list" when we moved in, but it was mostly little things like loose outlet covers and a wiggly toilet handle. We turned in our punch list on a Sunday, and THAT DAY Tony came and addressed every single thing on the list. We have had other minor maintenance requests (kitchen light bulbs, fan switch) and someone came to resolve the issue the same day. Only once did we have to wait until the next day, and that was when I called at the end of the day on a Sunday, but then Tony came at 9am on Monday. Having lived in the bay area for a year (and paying $1900+ for 748 sq ft) we LOVE the amount of space we have in our apartment and have found the rent to be extraordinarily reasonable. We also live on the third floor with a view of trees and preserve (not parking lot) and I'm quite sure that also factors into the rent cost. Every SINGLE time I call the office or stop in to pay rent, the staff is professional and polite. Arlene, Nichole, Nora, Charlie, Diane and Tesha are so helpful and kind.  The grounds are kept up quite well, and one of the things that we really love about this complex is that there are a lot of trees and it feels very park-like. We were very surprised to find out when we moved in just how large this complex is because I doesn't feel that way at all. Also, a big deal for us was the amount of available parking. No matter what time of night we get home, we can always find an open spot close by. I have read a lot of the reviews on Google about this complex and for the life of me, can't fathom why there are so many negative reviews. The only thing I can think of is that there are folks out there who sign a lease without reading it, don't follow the rules, don't pay rent on time, and when they are punished they turn to the internet to leave negative feedback. If you are thinking about being a resident in this fine complex, please know that there are hundreds of apartments here, and don't let fifteen complainers sway you. My advice is to pick a top floor unit with a nice view, and sit back and relax!</Review>< pics>

<Rate>1<//Rate><Review>Lived here for 5 months, though the place was beautiful, the parking sucked, the Maintenance people never fixed anything the entire time we lived there, and I caught the gardeners blowing all of the leaves and debri onto my brand new car with only 200 miles on it, then blowing the leaves and dirt off of my car. I always wondered why my car kept getting dirty until the day i walked out and witnessed it. I was furious.

Then, when we turned in our 30 day notice, the next day they left a paper on the door saying they dont accept 30 day notices it has to be 60 days so they took our entire deposit and made us pay another months rent.

I lived there with 3 other roommates and they didnt notify us that we had a balance due because they were going to charge us another month, so an entire year later we get a call from a collections company. All of us have the same numbers as we did when we lived there and it took a year for them to notify us we had money due and it wasnt even from them it was from an agency.

Everytime i called to speak to the manager, they always sent me to her voicemail and to this day have never gotten a call back from her about any of these issues.

please please please dont suker yourself into moving into these apartments, they are over priced and you can hear everything through the walls.

Your covered parking is most likely going to be 3 buildings down so you probably wont even use it, which is half the reason there is no parking for guests.

If you move here, youre an idiot, just read these reviews and listen to them. It will save you money and a huge headache< /Review><pics>None</pics>< resp>

They require a 60 day notice to vacate, but they only give you 30 days notice that they are raising your rent.  So you either get stuck paying the increase for another lease period (shortest is 9 months), or you have to pay ungodly lease buy out fees ($2200+) or an additional $275 PER MONTH to do a month to month until you move out.  Needless to say, once this lease is up, I'm out.< /review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

NOTE: I left a transparent review about my horrific experience with Urban Pet Hospital the first time I used them, but they offered to fully refund me for my visit if I took my review down. I will not be selling out again for a refund, and have since learned that bribing yelpers to take down negative reviews is highly illegal! But I imagine it's how they maintain a good rating.

I gave this vet a second shot despite my initial bad experience because I was informed that they were under new management. Their new manager insisted that former manager was responsible for my previous nightmarish visit. I found the situation a bit shady,  but given this vet is just a few blocks from me and was allegedly under new management, I desperately wanted to make it work for convenience.

After spending $300-$500 on a consult and various prescriptions that resulted in no improvements for my dog's stomach issues,  I called back to  discuss further treatment options and next steps. I called first thing on a Monday (5 days ago) to speak to a vet or vet technician, and have received zero calls back.  Each time I call to followup,  a receptionist says a vet technician or vet will be in touch by EOD, and like clockwork, I get radio silence. After a week of this,, I pleaded with a receptionist to send me my dog's record's so that I can seek further treatment from a different vet. My new vet was hesitant to prescribe treatment without reviewing records of his previous diagnostics and treatment.  The receptionist essentially held his records hostage, telling me that she needed clearance from a vet before she could share my dog's records with me. The new vet who I ended up seeing for further treatment insists this behavior is not only unethical and they've never even heard of a vet withholding a dog's records from the owner.

If you're reading this your review, then you love you pet, and I urge you to avoid this place for their health and well-being.</Text>

<user>112484763676157876432</user><name>Sydney Heath< /name><Rate>2</Rate><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Review>I initially called Urban Pet hospital with two simple questions: 1) do you have a board certified dentist and 2) are you able to treat anemia in cats. Instead of answering, the receptionist said "I can't give you any medical advice before you make an appointment for an exam". Of course I was not asking for any medical advice.
At this point I was so run down and frustrated because of how hard it's been to find a board certified dentist, and I was so worried about my very sick cat that I agreed to make an appointment. Well, $165 later and they 1) didn't have a certified dentist and 2) couldn't prescribe me the anemia medication. It was such a waste of time and money that could have been easily avoided had the receptionist just answered my questions.

They clearly are more interested in making money than anything else. I only gave 2 stars rather than one because the doctor seemed sincere and was genuinely sorry he could not help my poor cat. As a first time pet owner, this was a terribly disheartening experience. I've never been so moved to write a bad review (I've never actually written a bad review of anything before).<//Review>< Date>

I made an reservation for my dog two weeks ago for an annual check up. Today when I showed up right on time for the appointment, THEY ARE CLOSED!!!!  There is no phone call or any updates from the hospital staff about rescheduling or closing. On Google still shown as 9am-8pm. There is a noticed on the door said they are closed and a list of hospitals and phone number for emergency visit. I called the first phone number on the list, the hospital staff told me I am the sixth customers that call about the same issue.
Totally waste of time and energy. Now I had to wait for another 2 months for other hospital appointment.
No show/last minute cancellation is a totally red flag for any kind of business. Hopefully you will consider bringing your pup somewhere else when you see this post.</Text>

<Review>I would NOT recommend Urban Pet Hospital. I've given them the benefit of the doubt and gone a couple times, but I'm been so disappointed each time at the cost and unnecessary painful tests for my poor puppy. I honestly would pay a premium for high quality care, but they try to get you to do additional tests to charge you at your dog's expense.

For example, I wanted to start my 4 month old puppy on preventative monthly heartworm medication. I called the office, and was told I had to bring my dog in for them to do bloodwork. I happened to know that you can't do heartworm bloodwork on puppies less than 6 months old because that's how long it takes for heartworms to show up on the test. They insisted that I had to bring my puppy in to get his blood drawn. This would mean I'd need to pay for the office visit ($69+) plus the blood draw ($50+) and then the medicine. I don't even care about the cost, I was really upset they'd be ok putting my puppy through that for no reason. I called the SFSPCA and they filled the script immediately over the phone, because of course it's just preventative medicine.

I do think the vets are super nice & helpful, but the rest of the staff is so rude and honestly, just mean for no reason.

Again, even if cost doesn't matter to you - think about your pet, and don't put them through unnecessary tests & bloodwork.</Review>< UserId.>

Would give zero stars if possible. We made an appointment for an important vaccination days ahead and when we arrived, the vet was closed without notice on a Tuesday afternoon. They didn’t pick up their phone and no cancellation notice. Really poor service and will advise everyone not to rely on this place.<//review>

Thank you Urban Pet Hospital! They were kind enough to squeeze our Lola in during the power outages in Marin, when our vet was closed. She was tested and treated gently and without delay. Her bronchitis is resolved and she is our happy Maltese again (and we are all sleeping better).< /review>

Look, I'm the worst. I reschedule last minute all the time. I email them constantly because I've misplaced invoices and I lose my dogs vaccination records. I have dumb questions all the time. And no matter what they are so quick to respond to me and help me with whatever I need regardless of how annoying. It's so wonderful. I've been taking my dog here since she was a puppy and I recently took her for the first time during all this COVID madness. They were so efficient and communicative and streamlined with their process. My dog hates the vet no matter what. She's actually a huge pain in the butt and is a major diva and they only ever say good things about her. Really top notch team up here.<//Text>

Someone recommended Urban Pet Hospital.  We met with Dr. Adams for a comprehensive check up to discuss age-related issues pertaining to our kitties.  Dr. Adams suggested a dental cleaning as a pivitol step towards keeping our cats healthy, and preventing tooth decay (and lessening the chance of having to have teeth pulled in the future).  They did a wonderful job with both of our beloved animals, were very professional and competitively priced.  I would highly recommend this veterinary practice for your dog or cat....< /review>< pics>

One of our dogs has had a host of health issues and they are always patient and comprehensive with us. Dr. Adams is particularly great - she remembers your prior conversations well, is creative in her solutions (not too quick to jump to conclusion) sits and really explains her recommendations, and even follows up with a personal phone call to check in. You can tell that she and the team genuinely care for our dogs as much as we do. We recently moved to Marin - but still bring our dogs to Urban.

They have also updated their protocols for COVID-19/social distancing - so you can get treatment for your pet and stay safe.< /Review>< Gmap_id>

I think they are more in the business of selling vaccines and medicine than really caring for your dog.

I have a puppy and  2 months ago we took him there for a check up and to get all his shots. I thought this was the beginning of our relation with them as our official vet.

A week ago my dog was not feeling well, he could barely stand up. This was around  3PM on a Sunday. I called them hopping they could see my puppy. For my surprise they said that they could not see my him because they were busy but I told them, I think this was serious, they told me "Sorry" and they referred me to an emergency room. Today I called them to understand how they work, they confirm to me that they need days or weeks to see our dog and we can not rely on them for immediate needs. I did not know that dogs schedule in advance when they are going to get sick.

I am fine if thats how they want to work but please don't call yourself a Pet Hospital, thats misleading. They are fancy pharmacy and they are operating just to make the easy money. With this name and their practices they should be at least upfront with new patiences. They should say I do check ups and prescribe drugs to your dog but if you really need us, please go to an emergency room.

It was a terrible experience having your dog sick during regulars hours and getting denied from your "vet".

Please change your name to Urban Pet Pharmacy, because you have nothing of a hospital.<//review>

Terrible service. While we brought our dog to the vet, the receptionist was rude. When we got home, they called us saying they forgot to give us the right documents.
It is not a cheap place so nobody deserves be treated like that.
Registering in another vet next month.< /review>

So unprofessional. Booked a first appointment for our cat and the lady helping seemed great. She says first opening was Tuesday at 2. That’s a tough time as I have two small children I normally put down for nap at this time. So the day comes I rush around get the kids down load my screeching cat up into her crate and start to head over. Well would you know that suddenly my appt is changed to Thursday at 2. Terrible and they wouldn’t fit me in. Bye bye. Will find a spot who respects clients time.</text>

The Urban Pet Hospital did not provide any recommendations for other places to take him and when requested, would not release our pet's medical records. They quoted 3-5 days (the industry standard during an emergency is less than 24 hours). It has been over 2 weeks and they have still not released the records. Our dog is only 7 months so it should be easy to release a couple medical records. Would not recommend going through the trouble with so many other wonderful offices nearby.

The front desk is extremely unprofessional and rude.<//text>< pictures>

The kindness and love and compassion that was given to me and my cat was wonderful.

The wonderful doctor was understanding and offered 2 options.

The next day I knew it was time to euthanize my cat and the manner in which it was done was heartwarming!
It helped make a very sad time so much easier for me .

I highly recommend this facility for the above reasons<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None</Resp><GmapID>0x808580d6c9f96ac1:0x7e2c6f0c5da962ee< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

We have been going to Urban Pet Hospital for over a year now. We used to take our 13 year old boxer Sarge there until we had to put him down. During this time, Dr Garg and his team have treated us like family. When it was time to put Sarge down he shut down his office for us and came to our apartment.  Although this was a very tough time for both my wife and I, Dr Garg and his team made it easier.  Now we have our new puppy Smitty.  Even though we've now moved out of the city, we still make the trip in to the Marina to see Dr Garg and team because we couldn't think of having anyone else care for our new pup.< /Review>

I love this vet clinic. Everyone is so nice and not pushy. The people here take their time to explain things  to me and allow me to think things over before committing to anything. I love that. There's always treats for my pet and the vets and technicians are so patient with her (she can get a bit nippy around strangers). Overall would recommend this pet hospital!<//text>

I have had to put one cat down due to cancer and they were nothing but gracious and patient with us as we said goodbye, making sure she was comfortable and that we were aware of everything along the way. With my second cat, he was diagnosed with diabetes and Dr. G and his staff again, have been incredibly helpful as we navigate this new lifestyle. They are kind, thoughtful, patient, and I never feel as though I am being taken advantage of or that am being asked to run extra tests that may or may not be needed.

<text>They keep very limited hours--vet technicians and the vet are only onsite midday, although the clinic is open hours before they arrive. They refuse to work with other veterinarians to fill prescriptions in emergencies. You must pay them the initial visit fee for them speak to your vet about filling a prescription. They are not in this business because they love animals, it's just about the money here.< /text><Pics>None<//Pics></record></dataset><record>

Really, really wonderful team here. I've been to several of the top rated vets in SF and this team blows the rest out of the water.
1. They really care about the animals. I got follow up calls to check in on my cat days after her visit. When I had to leave her there overnight, the team knew her and her personality and has clearly spent time trying to keep her comfortable and happy.
2. They were always upfront about costs and willing to give me options. Every time they suggested a treatment, they gave me an estimate of costs before moving forward.
3. The doctors are very skilled and super smart. They were always willing to explain both the diagnosis and the treatment medically in a way that made sense.

Great team, highly recommend them.< /text>

The doctor and staff are really friendly and obviously pet lovers.  They're always on schedule so you won't have to wait too long for the doctor to see you.  The facility is clean and spacious.  Also, they're very calm and patient, which is great for me b/c my dog is scared of EVERYTHING.  I definitely recommend this place.
Urban Pet Hospital is such a great Veterinary clinic!  I tried out a few vets before settling here, and I've been very happy with them.< /Review>

The staff is always friendly and accommodating. Both times my pup and I have been here, they've checked with me first before proceeding with anything that I might get charged for so that I don't feel pressured or overcharged or upsold. Everyone there is very professional and sensitive to my dog's needs. Highly recommend this place to other pet owners!</Review>

This was one of the worst customer service experiences I've ever had.  I politely let the staff know that I was trying to get my dog to a flight that was 5 hours from our simple wellness appointment time.  The staff refused to mention this time crunch to the doctor and I was not seen until over an hour after my apt time.  Also, they told me over the phone that they would call my normal vet, SPCA, and get my dog's health info the day before we arrived.  They didn't do this until an hour after I arrived.  I heard them making the call from the other side of the door while I was waiting for the doctor.  This also delayed the paperwork we needed.  Lastly, when I called to set up the apt, I explicitly said I needed a Wellness Exam & a Rabies Certificate for a flight.  They assured me this was possible and that they could get the existing rabies info from SPCA.  It was only an hour after my apt time, when they called SPCA, that they informed me they could not get a Rabies Certificate bc they did not have an in-house doctor who gave the shot.  This was incredibly stressful and the worst part was that they treated me as if I was being unreasonable.  I kept my cool for over an hour and then simply asked for us to be seen as soon as possible.  This simple wellness exam took 2 hours total with the wait and they were not even apologetic.  I'll never go back here.<//review>

We found Urban Pet Hospital by accident after we got our 2nd puppy and couldn't be happier!

Dr. Garg & Dr. Adams show an incredible amount of care and professionalism when handling our animals. They take more time with us each visit than any other vet we've been to. They are thorough and upfront about costs so there are no surprises.

We are so happy our animals are under their care!< /Review>

They deserve 10 stars.  The doctors and staff at Urban Pet Hospital go above and beyond with every patient.  The patient always comes first with them, and in my experiences with them they have always spent as much time as I needed answering all of my questions and concerns.  Words can never go far enough to describe how much we appreciated Urban Pet Hospital.</Text>

GO ELSEWHERE!!!  Prioritizes money over healthy pets!!!

Never take your pet here!   I took my black lab here for treatment.  She was having some internal bleeding issues.  They checked her out for an initial fee of $150 but then said I needed X-rays right away and I could get them done either same day or the next day but that day would cost additional money (for immediacy).  Obviously I opted for same day.   They they sold me all these cans of special food as well as medication which needed to be administered 3 times per day.  By the time I walked out of there I had a $700 bill.  Nothing changed with our dog other than I kept giving her the medication and feeding her the special food.  So, I took her to another local vet who indicated that Uban Pet Hospital is not reputable and I needn't have done anything other than let whatever she had swallowed pass.  Because the dog kept acting healthy there was no need for concern and actually the medication could have hurt the dog.  So, we took who off the medication and just fed her chicken with rice.

Lesson is not to let Urban Pet Hospital convince you of something on the spot when the dog is acting fine.  Thanks for taking advantage of someone who was concerned about their pet and refusing to cut the charges down when I complained.  I hope your business suffers.<//review>

Both the front desk and Dr. Hoque were caring, accommodating, and extremely efficient. They asked many questions about our dog's care and feeding and made recommendations.  They went out of their way and called our previous vet to ensure that only needed vaccines and treatments were given.  I particularly appreciated being able to be in the treatment room with Dr. Hoque.  Not only could I reassure our rescue dog who was traumatized by having been abandoned twice at previous vets, but also ask the good doctor about general care questions I was not finding answers online. We left with all the shots needed and with better knowledge of how to take care of our pet.</text>

<text>I would give them 0 stars if that was an option. What started like a nice, neighborhood practice, turned into money making machine in no time. I feel bad because I recommended their practice to my friends. Here is what happened: My 12 year old cat, Nate had to be put down. He had been very sickly since I adopted him(6 years ago) and started going down hill pretty rapidly over the last year. He lost half of his weight and after $600 tests the dr at Urban told us he had serious liver problem. We decided to let Nate live in relative comfort since he was still eating, drinking and being social. I informed the doctor I will be putting him to sleep when he gets worst. He did.  I called Monday and scheduled the appointment for 4PM. I told the receptionist it was for putting Nate down. My sad, heart broken, husband arrived with our cat at 4 only to discover tons of people with their pets checking in, out, waiting, calling etc. He had to wait for 40 minutes to be taken to the room. The doctor came over and acted like he did not know why my husband was there. Then he second guessed our decision. It was horrible! If you ever had a chance to euthanize your pet, you know how sad, devastating, emotional, guilt producing that experience is. After few minutes my sick, stressed out, half alive cat was removed from the room to put catheter in " so he will be more comfortable". There was ABSOLUTELY NO NEED TO PROLONG HIS MISERY AND PUT CATHETER IN. It was done to escalate the cost of the whole operation. End bill : $500 I did have to put to sleep 2 of my previous cats and 1 quick shot did it all. There was no need for catheter or 3 different drugs. To make the long story short:
The quality of the end of life says volumes of the practice and speaks much louder than vaccinating perfectly healthy, cute puppies. I am so disappointed and angry. I feel the lack of empathy and sensitivity of Urban Pet Hospital is absolutely appalling. I feel my husband was totally taken advantage of and my cat died stressed out and in agony. I will never use those people again for any of my pets.<//text><pics>None< /pics>< response>

Have been coming to Dr. Garg for about a year now for our 8 year old puggle. They're great with him and the office staff is always friendly and accommodating. Dr. Garg is thorough in his medical assessment and honest in giving medical advice. Really appreciated it when Dr. Garg let me know its worth the $$ to check further vs. there are no real concerns etc., so not worth $$. The team has really earned our trust and loyalty.<//Text>

Absolutely love this place. Still drive from San Mateo to San Francisco for them to take care of my lab Kylo. Would not consider a new vet, and would 100% recommend them to anyone. The level of care and explanation they provide is second to none, and they have never attempted to upsell me or run any unnecessary tests. They also have a great staff who watches Kylo whenever I need to board him. Thank you guys for everything you have done!< /Review>

I just want to start off by saying that as soon as you walk in you are given kind attention and the place is immaculate. The staff is very comforting and attentive,their service is very pet friendly and human friendly.Everyone is very enthusiastic about the pets and so far i have had nothing but positive experiences with the Urban Pet Team, i always feel and know that my dog is in good hands.<//text>

I found a lump on my dog's breast that made me nervous. The dr was so open about all the possible outcomes and reality of the situation. After some tests it made sense to have surgery done to remove her entire left chain of breasts. During the surgery they found additional cancerous lumps.

The process and healing for my pup were so quick and she is back to her normal self with almost no scarring. The staff were very friendly and called regularly during her recovery just to check in on us.

We continue to go back for other checkups and needs.   I would definitely recommend.</review><Name>Christina Lien< /Name></record></dataset><record>

Dr Garg cuddles my cat like it was his own.  Takes care of my boy that way too.  After some unfortunate experiences with other vets in SF, I am so grateful to the Urban Pet Hospital.</text>

They were very nice. The gentleman at the front desk, was friendly and helpful. I will say, that i think the doctor lacks some compassion when it comes down to the financial but he is just doing his job. I dont see him going above and beyond. He just does his job. Good enough for me. My babygirl was back to normal, after having an allergic reaction, in a matter of days and they called 48 hrs later to make sure she was doing well which i thought was very cool. Overall, great place. Clean environments. Friendly staff. 👍<//Review>

<review>This vet hospital is a joke. They talk about wanting to help people, but the second you annoy them they write you off forever, plus the way they treat some of their clients is ridiculous. They get zero stars in my opinion.<//review>< resp>

<Text>Dr. GARG is rude and tactless. He treats his staffwith disredard and as a perspective employe is dismissive, demanding and blind .His Unprofessionalisn profound. I could not understand his  speech/ HEAV accent . I regret applying. More than a half hour late.
My treatment by him was disgraceful and embarrassing.
As a  Medical Professional of over 15yrs I would NOT seek employment here- EVER Again

I go to this location every other month and I tolerate their unfriendliness because of their proximity to my home. I should've checked the latest carryout order before I left the store because my "double" pepperoni add-on was only regular. For those who don't know, there is extra (which is a little more than standard) and double (which is more than extra).

My son loves picking off the pepperoni from his pizza. He was so disappointed when he only got 2 pieces on his slice.

If you have seen the technology that goes into ensuring pizzas are promptly and accurately made at any Domino's location, you'd be impressed by the amount of technology that goes into it. They have many LED Monitors with metrics & orders to keep track of it all. I can't help but think that this location may be  cutting corners somewhere...

Go to a different location if you want friendly, accurate service.< /review>

Unprofessional delivery. Drivers are not even better than Doordash now. I thought being a professional pizza delivery company, the drivers have more sense in direction and locations. Took an hour to deliver for a 2.5mi distance. I enjoy cold pizza. Thank you very much.</review>

<review>Was passed on to three stores.  Each one won’t deliver stating the address is not within their store’s delivery area.  Took 30 mins for me to finally place an order via online and another 45 mins to wait for the delivery.<//review>< pictures>

The delivery was way backed up and the poor driver was running in the dang mask to make up some time to all the spots in our area. Appreciate you my guy. I literally saw you running across individually for each order to keep them all warm. You rock 🤘🏼< /text>

<text>Just had an order delivered. And I called the restaurant because of a couple of concerns. The first was that it took 25 min for my pizza to arrive after I saw on the app that the driver had left so it was cold. The second was the fact that the pizza box looked like it had been sat on. I probably would not have even called but what really bothered me was that the driver insisted I sign the receipt with a sharpie he had that probably at least 20 other people have touched. I didn’t feel this was necessary as my credit card was charged. So I called and asked for a manager and when I explained my concern he had attitude and could care less. Said that’s the way it’s done and if my food was inedible he’d send more. I told him not necessary as I am not comfortable with his careless attitude on safety and sanitation at this time. Beware!< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

They consistently get the order wrong. I’ve now had 2 of my last 3 orders missing sauce cups. Their “delivery insurance” is a sham - they only offer to credit you for “next time”

Edit: Decided to give them another shot, and once again there was no sauce cup. Who ever is in charge of QA at this store is not doing their job. I even put a special note asking “please don’t forget the sauce”<//review>

<Text>I am really surprized how they can take 45 mins+ for a take away pizza order.As per the tracker my pizza went into oven after almost 35 mins of order and I reached even after 2 mins of estimated completion time, It was not ready, it took another 5 mins. The lower rating is not for delay, but other factor
1. They need to know what call customer service, once I arrived, all busy doing something and including one of them busy with his friends in customer lobby area.
2. I did online update for my arrival, nobody ever care to ask me and literally I had ask twice for my order readiness.
3. They are tottaly unorganized, I know other dominos they get same or more orders but never forget to make on time.
I just tried this location, never I will be back again.< /Text>< Pics>

<review>The Aliso Viejo store has no idea about service. They put me on hold literally 20 minutes and the employees have no idea of how to talk to customers or answer questions. I ordered on line and supposed to have a credit from last time order. After calling and staying on line for 20 minutes, no one could help me. Then they asked me to call back in 39 minutes. Awful service.... don’t order from this store... I will no order from dominos at all.<//review><gmapID>0x80dcef4567717301:0x9156a7ab5644b466<//gmapID>< resp>

Attempted to call for a carry out order. The teenager on the phone took 10 minutes just to take my simple order (large pepperoni pizza with sausage).  Placed me on hold numerous times, then passed me over to another teenager.  Upon picking up my order I was greeted by the two teen boys and another teen girl standing there. Then they high five each other.  I certainly hope nothing was done to my pizza.. Buyer beware.. Kids running the place, no management on hand. Very disorganized and seriously lacks basic customer service skills.  Shame on the owners and the management.  Know your staff.. Be aware of what goes on!< /Review>

Short staffed so no one can answer the phone to even explain what's going on and why no order update. Took over an hour before the pizza was even in the oven and still had to pay. Staff was fine and managed with the cards they were dealt. But I really hope they learn from this and maybe offer free breadsticks or something in the future for the inconvenience...
I'm not particularly interested in ordering from this location again.</Review>< pics>

<text>Trilogy Review

***Original 1 Star Review***

March 2018

As I write this review I have officially been on hold for 8 minutes and 22 seconds...

I ordered delivery and the order came wrong. I asked for no cheese and there is cheese on my pizza.

And what is up with this flavorless pizza? Domino's never taste like this.

Officially 9 minutes on hold. Order with someone else.

***New 4 Star  Review***

I called again and got a refund and a coupon. I spoke with the manager and he apologized. Can't be mad at that...

***2 Months Later***

5/3/18

The discount promised was not given. Manager didn't write anything down so the store did not honor it.< /text>< Pictures>

Well this has happened a few times and it's always with the free pizza you earn.  I paid a little more to get the pan pizza and toppings with my free pizza but it was horrible because there was'nt enough cheese to cover the pizza and there were burned spots 😒 luckily the large that wasn't free was perfect.  I just wish the free pizza were as good quality as the paid pizza like they should be.</text>

Walked in and made a simple order for some garlic twists. Fifteen minutes later when they would be done they were no where to be found. They either lost my food, or failed to even start it in the first place.< /review>

The most amazing customer service. When our Pizza was dropped off and the delivery driver asked how our day was, we told him our dog had a stroke. It had been a rough day. About an hour later, we hear a knock on the door. A delivery of a different kind. A sympathy card signed by the domino's team.</Review>

Legit not worth it. Delivery driver forgot order of garlic twists, when I called, guy on the phone says "no the driver is pretty sure he delivered it". First off, why would I lie about bread for god sakes. And two, it's not like I want to be calling you instead of going on with my night.  Food sucks, service sucks, and now basically being called a liar over some damn bread. 0/10 will not be ordering again.< /text>

My carryout order was estimated to take 11-16 minutes based upon the Domino's Tracker.  It took an hour and only during the last 10 minutes of waiting was I told that they forgot to fire up my order.  Despite the tracker having indicated that the order was done nearly 30 minutes before.  "Manager" was arrogant, very "take it or leave it".  Refused to give me his name when he knew I would be contacting someone else.
What happened to this location?  It used to be a good place to order from.  No more.< /review>

<Text>When they get it right the pizza is good, but 50 percent of the time they screw things up. Usually they leave a topping off or make the pizza on the wrong crust. You just have to hope you're lucky each time you order.< /Text>< pictures>

Most of the time when I order from here, the order is correct and the delivery is polite and punctual. However, there are times when they've gotten my order wrong.</Text>

Took 10 minutes to choose pizzazz online, but their system was down before submitting the order. Called Laguna Hills store, they guy says "sorry I am by myself, call back later". Called backed later, he gave me 1:40 minutes wait time. What the hell.</review>

<Text>If I could post ZERO stars I would. This is by far, let me make this perfectly clear. BY FAR the worst dominos pizza I have ever been to in my life. I decided to place an order over the phone, I called and a young lady picked up the phone and before I made the order I asked her several times if she delivered to my location, upon which she assured me she did and even doubled check it with her manager. 1 hour after I placed and payed for the order, a frustrated woman from a different location calls to tell me that the order had been transferred because, in fact they had NOT delivered to my location and then she told me I had to wait another HOUR to have my pizza. Unacceptable. Truly. Unacceptable. The owner should be ashamed.< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None</resp>< gmap_id>

<Rate>5< /Rate><text>Pizza and their sandwiches are great always fresh hot I love their chicken alfredo pasta and with their $5.99 special you can't go wrong. We also order for delivery many times their prompt courteous employees and only one time was thepizza wasn't that great, but every time in the past years we ordered food from them everything is been delicious served hot the main guy who is kind of skinny and older man when we go in there is always very pleasant he takes care of the registers but when we order food to be delivered whoever delivers has been great what a difference from doordash where many of their drivers that deliver the food are rude.</text></record></dataset><record>

I called asking about my order, and the guy that answered my phone didn't have my order and says I don't know what you want me to tell you I don't have your order there's nothing else I can tell you being totally rude when I was confused why my order has taken 40 minutes! AWFUL employees I will not order from here anymore. Completly rude to a nice female customer! Next time I'm getting his name</review>

<review>The Aliso Viejo Store has one of the most courteous staff in the area! they have always attended to my order quick and most of all friendly. Marciano the manager is a 5 my book. They do not even compare to the store in Laguna Niguel I would drive for my take out at the Aliso Viejo Domino's then in my area Laguna Niguel.

Thanks Franchise Owner for hiring such a wonderful Staff !!!

They forgot half the order and had to go back and get it. No one told me and I had to call and figure out where my food was an hour later after it said delivered. The food was all cold and the pizza was thrown together poorly and barely cut hence having to rip it apart. Don’t think I will be ordering again anytime soon .<//Text>

<Review>I received a text from my Sprint account that I need to switch out my Sim card at my local T-Mobile store in order to take advantage of their 5G network. I made a same-day appointment for the location at Palladio. I walked in, was greeted right away, and in less than 30 minutes I was on my way. It was fun to check out some of the latest chargers and blue tooth devices while I was there. Their store is located right next to the parking garage. Very convenient.<//Review><response>None< /response>< Time>

<text>Beyond offering a way better plan with better service than what we had with at&t, the customer service was exceptional. Ashley answered all of our many questions and helped us through the process patiently. For super specific questions, Nestor was able to jump right in and take care of them. What was amazing about the whole process was that they didn't try to upsale us on any products or services. Highly recommend stopping by if you're thinking of switching.</text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNcqFZYuC_p085Yr-_7puepld_lM0v-miiPSTNw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics><Time>1529461884470</Time>< Gmap_id>

<text>I had an appointment that unexpectedly ran over an hour in store because someone had used my information to create an account.  Arianna provided excellent customer service and got all of the issues resolved.  I recommend setting up an appointment beforehand to avoid a long wait.  Since the mobile space requires more hands on interaction with customers with varying levels of technical capability, there can be long waits for walk-ins from time to time. The customer service is worth waiting for and much better than dealing with a call center.</text>< Pics>

<rating>1</rating><text>I wish I could remember the name of the guy claiming to be manager of this store, but he needs help with customer service or at least more training. All the other employees have treated me with great respect and service. This manager uses the store as a pick up joint to meet women. I was the only customer in the store as he gave me his sales pitch. another man and his child came in and was cared for by the "Nice" other employee. Then it happened, two young girls came in and he just dropped what he was doing with me and started in with the girls. left me there standing for 20 minutes until the other employee helped me. All of us noticed this managers actions and lack of professional morals and attitude. he finished with them about 30 minutes later and tried to help me. when again he dropped what he was doing (helping his first customer-me) to help a single woman that walked in. Not only talking about phones he was obviously after something else than a phone sale. If I personally ever see him in there  will go to another store. He's a jerk the One star if for him only.<//text><pictures>None</pictures><Response>{'time': 1563908483854, 'text': 'I apologize for the experience you had in this store.

T-Mobile, as a company, rocks... their customer service people are great. What is surprising is that their store personnel are also great. I recently purchased a new phone from them and the people at the T-Mo store in the Palladio were great - very patient and helpful. I watched their interactions with other customers while I was there and everyone got straight-forward advice - and not a sales pitch. If you're tired of the push-push-push you get from AT&T or Verizon stores, try these guys - they're refreshingly different.<//text>

Jake at the T-Mobile store in the Palladio shopping center was very helpful. He had us in and out in less than 10 minutes for brand new phone. Really appreciate his attention to detail his willingness to save us money on a monthly billing and switching over my account settings. Customer service at this store is a lot better than the other Folsom store near Pete's Coffee.<//Text>

Tonight I left work in a hurry to make it to the T-Mobile store. They closed at 9 I walked in at 8:56 and they we eager and happy to help. I was there to get myself a birthday present witch was a new smart watch. Marco and his assistant manager we're so amazing. They were genuinely great full for my business. Just another reminder that my decision to switch to T-Mobile was a great one.< /Review>

Monica from t mobile, is literally a life saver. She is amazing. Countless times I have walked in needing help and she has helped me each and every time, remembering my name and it’s very welcoming. She has helped me throughout the entire process of switching to t mobile. It’s people like Monica we need in the world especially for someone like me who has no knowledge on switching phone careers! Thank you MONICA!!!  <3<//Text>

Hands down my best experience! Ashley helped me purchase a new phone and changed my entire plan saving me tons, all which only took about 15 minutes. The store manager Nestor was extremely helpful and knowledgeable on all platforms. Overall the entire staff was top-notch. Going to be making this my home store for sure! 😎<//Text>

This location is beautiful, probably one of the nicest T-Mobile stores I have ever walked into. Not only is this location beautiful and spotless, the staff here is professional and exceptionally helpful. I don't think I have ever gotten such amazing customer service in the hour I was there. I want to give a special shout out to Nai and Ashley for answering all my complicated questions with patience!<//text>

My experience at this T-Mobile store was just great! They made me feel welcomed as I was coming in to Pre-Order the S9 Plus. I got helped by a worker named Monica and she was so helpful, informative and nice. She made my first experience pre-ordering a new phone easy and quick.
I will definitely be coming to this specific location at the T-Mobile in the Palladio from now on! Especially with the staff that they have. I highly recommend these guys here!</Text>

<text>Nestor is an asset to T-mobile. I have been to numerous locations due to billing issues and non of them could explain why my bill fluctuates. Nestor was able to clearly explain why my Kick Back and Auto Pay discount sometimes does not go thru. Thank you Nestor for your patience.</text>< userid>

Nestor gave us absolutely perfect service.  H I wasn't able to get texts out. Nestor new how to troubleshoot. Knew exactly where to go on to the phone to help fix my problem. I am so happy that he fixed the problem that was making it so difficult because I could not text group messages nor could I send out messages more than about four sentences long.  He is a great asset to your company. Thank you</text>

<Review>Best T-Mobile Store ever!!! Nestor, Vivian and Marco were amazing, very helpful with the whole process, explained everything from new things on the phone, to what I was paying for! Store is huge and very clean, no waiting time. I went to 3 different T-Mobile stores before coming to this one, I will continue to do all my business at this location!!<//Review><time>1512356504287<//time><rating>5< /rating><username>Jessy K</username></record></dataset><record>

I had the best mobile phone store experience of my life at this TMobile location! The store manager, Nestor, was highly knowledgeable on all products, services, and promotions being offered by TMobile and takes pride in helping people get the most for their money. Him and his team made the transition smooth and easy. Marco on his team also notable in his knowledge and customer service. So definitely go to this location and ask for Marco or Nestor!< /Text>

<review>I do all of my T-Mobile business here because it is more spacious and less crowded. I am usually in and out in under an hour, which is rare at a phone store.

The guys there know their stuff and even helped me file an insurance claim for my lost phone.

I always recommend this location to anyone who asks!<//review><Response>None</Response>< GmapID>

Ashley and Monica helped me with an upgrade late night. They were fast and efficient, the only hold up was my dumb ass not doing an iCloud back up first. These ladies are not only hot, but smart.</review>

Shout out to Nai, Nestor, and Ashley for assisting me with my new phone! They showed me so many things I didn't know the Samsung could do. It's great knowing they're knowledgeable about the products. I have had a bad experience going into a previous tmobile store where the team including their own manager not knowing their stuff! It's a pain and a hassle some times going into the stores because all they ever want to do is sell you stuff!!!! However, at this location I didn't receive that vibe at all. They were courteous, listened, and found solutions to my problems.</Text>

<Review>This place is a little dive with such charm.  Good tasty food.  Don't go looking for valet service or some top chef stuff.   It's basic but good and very flavorful.  Takes cash only. And of lot of good hard working people run the place.  I always enjoy this spot.  If I am on that side of town I always stop by.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None</Resp>< gmapID>

Friendly, prompt, local, long time Los Angeles  natives regularly customers (at least 2 older people said they've been coming here for years), patio furniture is dated so not the most charming vibe, but good food and service. Large portions.< /Review>

For cash only, if you are in the area Teddy’s is hard to beat for the price, quantity, and taste!  Nothing fancy - simple and tasty with good service. Beware it does get busy in the mornings but somehow my coffee mug was always full! Great breakfast options - we ended up going 2 mornings and would have gone again if we weren’t passing thru.<//review>

It was ok, nothing really special with the place.

For starters, the parking sucks. The parking lot is too small. There was a line that was out the door.  The wait was about 5-10minute.  And its a cash only establishment.

The coffee was good, but the breakfast was average.

The scrambled eggs were nice and fluffy but the sausages were beyond salty.< /Text>

Very old school diner feel— which was much appreciated. The food reflected that, reliable, salty, nothing unexpected. Cash only is a downer, but otherwise solid, felt like a east coast family owned diner in the middle of LA. Breakfast sandwich, potatoes, and pancakes were all a hit.< /text>

It's usually the first stop for a hearty breakgast and we always feel welcomed here by the friendly staff. Even when the breakfast crowd is there, our food usually arrives at our table so fast and hot. So far everything I've ordered is all so satisfying and I always look forward to going back.</review>< rate>

<Review>Got the beef hash, it had good taste. I really enjoy the potatoes. The coffee is average. There was a very sick worker, blowing her nose all over the place. They should have sent her home especially at a food place.  Other than that everything was great.< /Review><GmapID>0x80c2bb0e39dc8f97:0xd2ef01003322c92e</GmapID>< username>

Sausage size is incredibly small and pancakes have an off flavor. Eggs cooked fine and toast is good. Definitely not a great experience but worth coming back to try a different menu item

Update: 2 weeks after my initial review I came back and tried a different dish. Got the corned beef hash. Unfortunately my experience led me to knock off a star from my original review.

Corned beef way too oily. Potatoes had a mushy texture. Egg had some weird off taste to it. Sourdough bread was ok.

Really wanted to like this place but unfortunately it is over hyped.</Text>< username>

<Text>What's not to love... real turkey, amazing service, unbelievable prices. While here I consistently saw regulars greeted by name by the staff and the owner, Teddy. The home cooking and the personalized service make you forget you are living in a large city, it feels like you are dining with friends. I will definitely be back. BUT be aware it is CASH ONLY.< /Text>< pics>

This place gets busy. Parking lot gets full quick. And you can only pay with cash. I had a spanish omelet with salsa on top which was pretty good.. And some potatoes on the side and a fresh orange juice. I might go back, only if there is parking.< /text>

<Review>Both a Bus Boy and a Waiter where very Nasty, Rude and Disrespectful to me because as a single customer I did not want to sit at a small table in the middle of two other close by tables that each already had customers eating in a pandanic  and wanted to sit at an open four person table with space away from other customers! After being Disrespected by two employees who  would not stop arguing with me for ten minutes I had to ask for the owner who was just as Nasty, Rude and Disrespectful as his two employees ! I will never go back to Teddy's ever again !< /Review><gmapID>0x80c2bb0e39dc8f97:0xd2ef01003322c92e</gmapID>< Rate>

Good food and great prices. This place is a reliable coffee shop option. Maybe not as good as some other places, but the staff is really nice and the prices can't be beat. I like the club sandwich and the breakfasts. Warning: it is cash only, but they do have an ATM.< /text>

<review>So glad we decided to go somewhere local instead of to a chain. We were only in town for a few days and the full parking lot suggested this place would be a hit. Everything on the menu was absolutely amazing. Great service. Loved the pancakes and the steak and eggs. Highly recommend!</review></record>

<review>True greasy spoon that somehow maintains prices that are a blast from the past.

Food is quite decent, decor is era-appropriate, parking lot is just adequate.

Not enough to get excited about aside from the price, but if you’re already in the area, it’s worth a stop, at least for breakfast.</review><Time>1577689301785<//Time><GmapID>0x80c2bb0e39dc8f97:0xd2ef01003322c92e< /GmapID>< Pics>

Counter dinning, or booth option. Can't go wrong.

Maria and teddy the owners are so welcoming and genuine. Chava is a great water that always puts a smile on our faces. Angelica is a very sweet and warm waitress. Food is made to order, comforting, consistent and just what you'd expect at a diner with a few Mexican dishes available. Love their steak and eggs.

<Rate>5< /Rate><review>I've been coming here for a few years and feel very comfortable here. Its basically a diner and has daily specials. The service for me has been great prices are very reasonable Fish and Chips on Friday is my favorite. A lot of model cars decorate the walls the owner is a classic car guy so you may see his 65 or 57 Chevy in the lot on a nice day. Thursday is their car night so you may run into other car guys.<//review>< pics>

This place is a great little old school diner with some cheap eats. From the two times I've dropped in for breakfast, none of the food particularly blew me away, but I wasn't disappointed either because of the value and convenience. For breakfast I'd stick to the specials with boxes around them on the menu to get the most bang for your buck.</review>

<text>On a trip back home a few years ago we missed a turn off for one of our favorite breakfast spots, turned into this parking lot to turn around and never left.  Parking lot was packed and we figured that there had to be a reason.  WE WERE RIGHT!  Wonderful food, great ambiance and hot coffee.  Only complaint?  Not enough parking.  Okay - we can adapt as this place delivers in taste, value & speed of service!< /text><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

<review>Classic diner and a great deal. Well prepared food served by a friendly and attentive crew. The menu has something for everyone, with the emphasis on hamburgers, sandwiches and breakfast. I had the Westside special, 2 eggs cooked to order, two sausage (bacon is an option), and 2 pancakes (or toast). Good breakfast! Seating is comfortable and plentiful.<//review>< pics>

The food was great and the price was right. I had the veggies omelet and my wife has a veggie club sandwich. Plus they have cold beer. Everyone gave it a thumbs up. Plus, they were very kind to my two slightly autistic children.</text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None<//Response>< gmapID>

These places are dying all over town. Two local Norm's just disappeared within the last few years.
not as good as Norm's but few places were. This place is a total bargain provides exactly the kind of menu you think it would and has fast service in a very homely decor.<//Review>

Great staff, reasonable prices, good portions. Wouldn't recommend the canned corned beef hash if you like it better "fresh". Otherwise, this is definitely a place I will be back to when I'm around there near breakfast time!<//Text>

Girlfriend had never been to Teddy's, so we decided to go, instead of one of our more usual places.  In her words, it was "one of the best tuna melts" she'd had and I had a ham steak breakfast.  Good honest food, at a great price.< /text>

I love this place.  Diners like these are unfortunately becoming more and more scarce.  I get two delicious eggs, bacon, hash browns and 3 pancakes for $6.   The oatmeal is delicious.  All the lunches and dinners I've had are right where they should be.  It's not the Palms or Prime, but it's not supposed to be.  May they never close!<//Text>

<Text>I love this place! I've been coming here since I was 13 and is one of my favorites. I recently became vegan and they helped me fix a meal completely vegan with sautéed veggies and and avocado sandwich. Their waiters are very nice and they provide excellent costumer service.</Text>< Pictures>

< Review>
With all of the development in WLA, I'm surprised that this place still exists. Old school diner complete with appropriate fare, decor (imagine 1960 Mayberry but with latino servers) and prices!  My keto meal (eggs & hamburger steak) was cooked to perfection and served graciously. Based on overheard banter and casual observation, the patronage was mostly AARP set and locals. The wait staff was attentive without being bothersome. My mechanic moved nearby, so I'll be back.</Review>

<text>Pretty solid local breakfast joint -- can't believe I never tried it during all of the years I lived right up the street! I tried the corned beef hash, which came out in an interesting circular patty shape with a slice of pineapple too. It tasted good though, so that's all that matters. I liked the tiny cubes of potato for maximum distribution. I also had a side of biscuits and gravy, which was also very decent. Coffee was typical diner coffee, and service at the bar was fast and friendly.

tldr; it's a diner :-)</text>< Pics>

Terrible restaurant. The service was so poor. They took a long time to ask for my food and bring me my food. And when they did bring me my food the steak was undercook. I bought the issue to the waitress but she told me that there was nothing that she can do. And so i left but she expected a tip on the way out. Cx<//Text>

<text>I walked into Teddy's Cafe many years ago on the 2nd day of his operation.  Religiously I have not stopped eating there in over 24+ years.  I don't know if anything else needs to be said.  The food is tasty, the service is very good and the atmosphere is perfect for those simple, inexpensive great breakfasts or lunches!  I'm a much older man now and my 2 little boys love coming to Teddy's.  They can't get enough of the pancakes!  This place in a West LA icon and one must really experience it to know that these great places still exist and strive.   Have the biscuits and gravy!  You tell Teddy "Mugsy" sent ya.</text>< Pictures>
