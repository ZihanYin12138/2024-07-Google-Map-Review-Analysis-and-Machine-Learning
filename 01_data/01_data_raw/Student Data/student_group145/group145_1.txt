<text>The camp ground wasn't anything special at all. If I had one word to describe it, it's would be dirty as there is just bits of trash all over the campground, cordage tied to a bunch of trees, old broken tent poles, you name it, it's there. I had read beforehand that homeless people like to stay here and that is absolutely true. I do not have a problem with homeless people, but what I do have a problem with is that that took up 3 out of the 4 major campgrounds, leaving recreational and backpack users with noot as many options. There is a good water source for filtering and plenty of firewood. Although, it does get quite windy sometimes and the campground sits right in the middle of an open canyon. I would come back if I had to, but this wouldn't be my first choice.< /text>< pics>

This would be an amazing location for an easy overnight backpacking trip, but unfortunately most people leave food out which attracts animals,  and  the garbage problem here is unbelievable. The warnings about bears placed everywhere are there for a reason and there's clear signs of garbage bags being ripped apart by black bears. if this sort of behavior picks up its only a matter of time before the forest service closes the campground.</Review><resp>None< /resp>< username>

Once you get down into the hike it's absolutely beautiful. There were 8 or so creek crossings to get to the waterfall. Dogs are allowed on leash, but several owners let theirs off anyway 🤣.
BEWARE: the last Mile or so of this hike is NOT fun. Very steep incline with little to no shade.<//text>

Eternally grateful to Gould for some of our fondest camping and biking memories

Proximity and ease of entry make it a great overnight spot. Bike packed in with a buddy, we rolled just hammocks and it was no problem. 5ish fire pits. No water. There are toilets. Great place to shake down your gear and test it out before you head into real wilderness. Note though it is a free and open camp ground and attracts some interesting people, transient types camp here year around so just keep your wits about ya and it'll be fine.< /Review>

Great trail for mounting biking. If you like a moderate challenge on an 8 mile ride this is your trail. The trail does go further and there's are more trails to enjoy (streams to cross & rocky terrain). Very popular to the locals and people travel from afar to take pleasure on this hiking, mountain biking and horseback trail. Bring the family :-)!< /review>

Saw signs of coyote and mountain lion tracks near the creek crossings...use extreme caution hiking at dusk or dawn when these big cats like to hunt. The water is clear and cold but should still be boiled if used. A really awesome wilderness area close to the great city of Los Angeles. I used public transport from downtown ( gold line ) to the 260 bus line along Fair Oaks Blvd. To get within a mile of the trail head. Great people, great park, awesome fun!< /review><Name>Alan Earl<//Name><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

<review>One of my favorite hikes in all of Los Angeles. The trail is accessible by the camp site, but also from Switzer Falls and near JPL. It is well shaded and hugs the stream, if there is enough water.

The camp site is down a mile long fire road, so pack accordingly, especially because you'll have to walk back up the steep hill.

For a better back packing excursion, start the Gabrielino Trail near JPL, it is a good hike from there to the campground. If you want to do hard mode, start the gabrielino trail near Switzer. It is a good 9 mile hike along the arroyo secco, through some mountains, valleys, and an old river bed. With camping gear, it will be a great adventure.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

<gmap_id>0x80c2e9c3d87eda8b:0x9a9691975d09c4fa< /gmap_id><review>The last time I was there was about 25 years ago. This is a backpacker's campsite; in other words, the public cannot drive to it; you must backpack in or ride a horse in. When I was there, there was a ranger that lived in a trailer. There is a community of rangers that live nearby. This is a great place to hike to; it is an easy walk. The trail roughly parallels the stream. There is opportunity for shade along the trail from (near) JPL. There is a relatively large pool in the stream next to the camp.

If you continue up the trail you can go all the way to Oakwilde Picnic Area which is also a backpacker's campsite. The trail is easy except for the part that goes past a dam. I think that is in the area of the Paul Little Campground.

If you continue up from Oakwilde then the trail becomes relatively steep. It goes up to the Switzer Picnic area.< /review>< Name>

The donuts here are delicious, light, and fluffy! Also, I ordered the fresh juice: ABC, which had Beets, Carrots, and Apple and it was also superb! The lady who took care of our order was very friendly.</text>

<text>I love this donut shop. The guy (owner?) who works the night shift is always friendly. I love that they open late...almost 24 hours. The hours need to be updated here though, they close at 8pm and reopen 2 hours later at 10pm until the next day. Anyway, doesn't hurt that they also have one of the best donuts around. The texture is on point and price is great.<//text><Response>None<//Response>< username>

This donut shop has become my favorite place for donuts. The service has always been excellent and the donuts are delicious. They’re the best donuts I’ve had in Chino Hills.< /Review>

<rating>5</rating><Text>I live nearby and come here fairly often for the breakfast sandwiches. All of the sandwiches and donuts are really good. I would probably buy coffee from them too except they serve it in foam cups (can cause health issues!!). If they served it in paper cups I’d probably buy it pretty often! ;) ;) I love this place though, support local business!</Text>< user_id>

I’ve lived around here for six years and just went there for the first time for breakfast this morning. Instead of McDonald’s next-door. It was so good! They have bagels and breakfast sandwiches, not just donuts. Servers were friendly and it was set up very nicely with shields and distancing, etc so I felt safe in there.  Will definitely go back!</text>

So yummy. They donated donuts to our school and also helped us with a very large order. Efficient and accommodating. The donuts are delicious as well. This is a great neighborhood spot, most locals stop in once a week. I love the cronuts (fri and sat) and the chocolate old fashioned. They sell lotto tickets as well.< /Text>

Apple fritter was pretty good, but the cake donuts were hard as a rock, as if they’d been out for days.  If you go here, stick to their top shelf, high turnover items.  In general, donuts are cheaply made, get old fast and there is no good excuse for a vendor to turn over the end-of-day stock like this.</Review>

Great local donut spot. Bought donuts here for a baby sprinkle and as glad they took card.  The first time I went here, thought the workers were super nice and pleasant.  Made buying a donut fun and you wanted to come back to support local shops.  This most recent trip, the lady that helped me was super impatient with me and it left a bad taste in my mouth.  I mean, I get it was early but donut give me an attitude because I dont know the names of the different donut types.< /Review>

the name lives up to the status of the actual product they sell here. they are fresh and somehow even better when you come in early morning. my favorite is just the classic glaze or the donut holes. you can't go wrong with those choices.<//review>

I tried to order a group order for 10 people via Seamless and they cancelled my whole order because I asked that they separate out the pita due to a gluten allergy - then I called to resolve the issue (apparently they always separate it out...), and they had me resubmit the order. Then they cancelled the order again - why? Because they don’t take online delivery orders that big... they make you do call in to pick up takeout and they don’t deliver themselves.... I don’t understand why they wouldn’t take my money....<//Review>

<Review>One of the best Mediterranean restaurants I’ve been to and I’ve been to a lot. The people who served us (assuming they also own the place?) were so kind and the service was wonderful. The food was fresh, cooked upon order. Pita was on point! Will be back for sure!</Review>< Response>

The meal was delivered on time, looked great, however only one comment on the French fries. They would be so much better if you fried them to be a little bit more crisp either using the European method of frying them twice or at least letting them stay in the oil longer to crisp up. Otherwise the food is very good here and fresh.< /text><Name>Jay Jackson<//Name>< gmapID>

<review>This restaurant is the best in Indio, for my money. I'm not saying every experience is perfect every time. That's not my idea of realistic. I judge based on quality, consistency, service, ambience and convenience. By this standard, over time, and I've dined here on many occasions in a variety of contexts and for different purposes, Super Shawarma Mediterranean Grill deserves my five-star review.< /review>< pictures>

On Sunday (4/18) I walked in at around 1:20pm. I asked to pick up a Uber eats order.  The waitress said they have no Uber eats order.  I tried to show her it says ready to pick up on my phone.  She didn’t bother to look and said it was cancelled.   Rude. Worst attitude ever. I had to walk out and waiting on Uber support.  Ironically it remained ‘ready for pickup’ on my phone until at least 2pm and automatically completed it. So it thinks I picked up or whatever.</text><pictures>None</pictures><resp>{'time': 1618807582250, 'text': 'I am really sorry that Uber system didn’t show you right away that the order got canceled.

<review>Yes it's truly the Super Shawarma Mediterranean Grill in the Cathedral City, CA.  Better than Zachary's.  If you have a freind who disagrees, I'd challenge her to a blind taste-test.  Honest tongues prefer Little Star.< /review>< pictures>

We decided to try out this Mediterranean joint over Sushi (we’re creatures of habit) and we absolutely loved it! The Chicken Shawarma was delicious. My four year old enjoyed her meal as well; great options for kids. I enjoyed the atmosphere and music. Service was great. Very polite and sharp. Will be coming back whenever in the area.<//Text>

They don't even deserve half star! I send my wife there it took them like an hour to prepare two meal.we ordered 1/4  chiken meal and kabab.the chicken was very dry and old.pickles color indicate they are super old.hummus they open  a can of hummus and put a little bit.you can taste the can taste.rice dry as well and old.Garlic taste anything but not garlic.I am middle eastern myself and it is a shame those guys have such a poor and very cheap quality and expensive price.ignore that place and go somewhere else! Those meals were like 30$<//Text>

Great food! are Egyptian heritage and I'm used to Lebanese so the only thing I couldn't get was tabouli but the rest of the food was delicious. I ended up having excellent hummus and pita bread they also brought me out delicious rice and chicken shawarma yellow. I would highly recommend the falafel because it's freshly cooked, and you have to get The baklava for dessert. They call it goulesh but either way it's amazing</Text>

The chicken shawarma and 1/2 chicken is good and moist. Good serving size for food and plenty of indoor and outdoor seating.</review>

<Review>Service is friendly but rather slow, still expanding their menu, but a tasty alternative to the more widely available Mexican or Chinese restaurants in the area. Given their slow service take-out might be a better option.</Review><time>1515827699779</time>< Response>

Very poor customer service and communication.  I placed an order which was delivered promptly, however the order was incorrect.  No problem, I was promised a replacement order and, an hour later it still had not arrived and they were no longer answering their phone.  1 star -- not for the mistake, but for the lie about replacing the order that ended up causing a family to go 2 hours and have no delivery options as everything was now closed.

PS food delivered was not food that we could eat and was not picked up -- a very sad waste of food that had to be trashed :(  I will not order from them again.<//text>

Your issue is totally our fault and you are so honest of everything you wrote. You received a wrong order and your order wasn’t picked up yet. I talked to my server to be careful next time and make sure to give the right order to the right driver cuz it cost us money and lose customers. It seems she was doing it on purpose and she did the same thing with your Order. As matter of fact she gave your order to the driver that belong to a different company so we end up by firing her. We stop taking orders that night cuz I don’t have server as we told her to leave the restaurant right away. I spent more than four hours on the phone with Uber eat and Grubhub to notify them with our fault and make sure that all the customers get their money back and we are responsible for everything.\nI am explaining to you what happen even thought I understand that’s not your business. I am just trying to give excuses so you can give us a chance to make it up to you. So please contact us and we will do anything to win you back as a customer.

This is my second visit. I was greeted immediately by a friendly man. I was asked if I was enrolled in rewards points. I signed up shortly after he took my order. He also showed me the specials. I had the chicken shawarma plate, and lentil soup it was delicious. I loved the decor, the server was an older gentlemen, very polite. Reasonably priced. I highly recommend this restaurant.

Muy buena comida, buenos precios, personal amable.<//text>

Unbelievable.  The first time I've been denied service with my Mobility Dog.  Mind you, I rely on him for balance, and as an engine wearing full leg braces on legs that don't function.  I couldn't believe it when I told him (as if he didn't know) that it was a Federal Law, a California Law, and common decency, he still refused.  If you have a disabled friend or family member, do them a solid and find a better restaraunt to eat at.< /Review>

He was working with a drill, making very disturbing noise... remodeling while we ate. Beef was overcooked and food tasted like it was from the day before... wasn't fresh.

called and showed up an hour before the place was supposed to close, and it was already closed. Obviously they cut out early and don't adhere to their business hours. Lost business</review>

< Review>
Restaurant was out of food. We we're served the leftovers which didn't amount to the money we paid for it or how it was listed in the menu. A short time after we ordered the waitress came back and asked if it was ok to substitute an item from our meal because they ran out. How do u run out if rice? In the end, our meal was less than satisfying and the restaurant made no concessions for there short comings.< /Review>

Their falafel is dry and their falafel sandwiches do not taste good - there are so many better falafel sandwiches out there, unfortunately their's fell flat. The soup that came with the falafel was very good but that was about it.</text>

Food was well prepared. Service was slow for the amount of customers. Total seemed high at the end of the evening. Did not notice that they had added French fries to the bill that we did not order . Pricey for the quality and amount.</Review>

< Review>
My mom and I decided to try this place based on the Yelp reviews.  We both decided to try the chicken and beef schwarma platter.  The food was very good especially the soup, meat and rice.  We like the babba gonush, hummus and tzaziki.  We shared a piece of baklava which was a little disappointing because it was tough. The service was attentive.  The place was a little slow for a Saturday evening.  I hope they advertise more because I would hate to see them close.<//Review>

The service was outstanding however I didn't find the food to be quite as impressive as I was expecting. I think perhaps a better choice for Middle Eastern food would be some of the other restaurants in Cathedral City.< /text>

Ordered to go and was served old pita bread, was NOT fresh! Humus was watery; terrible food preparation. Food was flavorless, terrible food experience. Had Greek food before, in and out of state, this ain't it.</Review>

Food was a disappointment. Wasn’t as good as it seemed. Also when I was ordering, I was asking about a item and the lady (cook) was like “it’s right there on the menu” but it really didn’t say much< /Text>

For the price I would expect more quality, $10 burrito with more rice and very little beef, to top it off the Azada was rubbery. Normally I don't like to post negative comments but was not happy eating this.  : (< /text>

Place took 45 minutes to get a simple order. Three tacos. And a drink. They first took care phone orders that barley entering. People and service was horrible. Then since they backed up. They closed doors and didn't accept any orders. They charged for food but try say that they already gave me order. What bullshit. Is there anything less than a star< /review>

Its a good!! They have their Salvi yummy dishes and their Mexican delish dishes. My family and I have been coming for a few months now and have been trying a lil of both. The chilaquiles, are amazing! Their pupusas have a lil crispy exterior in it that is amazing. The chicken enchiladas have so much flavor (the chicken isnt bland 👍 like most places). The service is always great and welcoming.< /text>

The rice, beans, and steak don't really have any flavor to them. The portions are small and the food is relatively expensive for the lack of value. I've been here twice.

There are two facts here. This place was overpriced and we were underwhelmed.

We ordered 3 burritos, all wet:  2 chicken (I requested specifically to make them as SPICY as they can), 1 carne.  They were served with sour cream on the side and decent rice.  I didn't think we would need salsa because they were all wet, so I asked for none.  The beans were pureed to paste ... yet that would help for the arduous task ahead.

We all came to the agreement that the wet burritos are not seasoned correctly nor does the 'wetness' help these meals' inherent dryness.  The beans HAD to be mixed in because otherwise you would end up choking to get the burrito down.  They even had Cilantro in them ... which is all you tasted when you came across a leaf of it ...  We added salt to the beans and Tapatio and salsa, from our house, to these bricks to get some semblance of flavor... to no avail.  This food was a lost cause. It was like eating wet Army MREs.

I actually stopped in the middle of my burrito because I didn't want any more ... yet, I was still hungry.  I've only been that confused several times in my life ... how do I have food that I paid for, yet not want to eat???

This was compounded by the fact that all three burrito meals came out to be $40, yet we were given one bag of chips with 14 chips in it (nope, not a typo ... 14 chips, we counted).  I see now why they only gave us 14 chips ... we could barely get the burritos down, what would the chips do??

So, $40 ... for three burrito meals ... for slow take out Mexican ... basically, West Hollywood prices for food that tastes like bland Golden Corral ... yeah, won't be eating here again.

There is no way that the other 'good' reviewers are reviewing this place;  they may be talking about the other one on Lakersham that is also within 1 mile - not here.  I believe some of the other 'good' reviews are based on laziness, availability and the ability to order online delivery.  These reviews should review the food and not the fact that the delivery service delivered it to your door.

Also, there were two people that said it was the best Mexican food they've ever eaten while they were walking out (like they were trying to convince everyone that was there) ... they either don't get out much or they're lying to help the place.  I don't like liars because that is the reason I tried this nonsense in the first place.

I hate putting in a bad review because the women who make the food are very nice.  Yet, the food itself leaves a LOT to be desired.  Don't be swayed by the 5 star reviews; I think you would come out better driving through Taco Bell.< /text>

<Review>Do you want to walk across the Golden Gate Bridge but you're stuck in Sacramento? Then this is the bridge for you! Shorter by an order of magnitude and without that pesky drive through the Bay Area. If you frame your selfie just right, you can tell your friends that you're on the GG bridge and still make it to drinks that evening. Convenient parking on the Sac State campus or on the other side of the river makes this the go-to pseudo Golden Gate. Try it out today!<//Review><user>108453430514410814242</user>< Gmap_id>

<review>Really cool spot. It is a miniature of the Golden Gate Bridge. People had hammocks hung under the bridge. Made me really want to get a hammock. With river access on both sides of the bridge. We saw a family of deer swim across to the island and back. Lots of wildlife. Lots of trees for a nice shady picnic. We loved it and will be going back.</review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPMNLFUpPnttTgXKEWFxomPDjI03yy0i4sidaK5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPj5KJsZvv6sQHGX4kfXHjy-1KAii04VJWsY8mf=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOQQ3l4RqdTMPiQTJJFZ1O-uHnIJoJPrDxwrUoD=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO7R6ogXIfV7_lGLVWp3UuiowuuMVLwUC93i6jI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOmpZXVsY8yFl9oriyGjcNBgG9GWh8xA5CguREA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< Response>

<Rating>5</Rating><Review>I remember seeing this bridge back in 1973, while on vacation with my family when I was eight years old.  I never knew exactly where it was located, but it always held my interest.  I sometimes would think about this other red California suspension bridge.  Now, thanks to the internet, I know it to be the Guy West Pedestrian Suspension Bridge. It is a 1/7th scaled mini replica of the Golden Gate Bridge.<//Review>< Pics>

The views from Guy West Bridge, depending on the time, are extremely scenic. Some might say breathtaking! I fish from this bridge regularly. There are almost always Sac state students going either to or from school. It is also a favorite crossing point for the elite biking community in the area. Every one is always so friendly and respectful! Amazing photos can be taken here! Wonderful birds eye view of the American River! Nature lovers welcome!!
However swimmers beware!! The pics in this review are of a 400 + pound sea lion who regularly chase the larger salmon and steelhead through the river. When they catch them the sight is quite gruesome! The fish are ripped apart by the sea lion flinging them back and forth, slapping them on the water several times until one half goes flying. They then choke down half of a sometimes 26 pound fish then race off to get the other half. While fishing on the Sac river one day, a friend and i witnessed this up close and personal. The sea lion paid no mind to our boat, ramming into it while chasing what appeared to be several Salmon. We were jolted violently as the huge animal nearly capsized our boat! They are relentless eaters and i have no doubt a human being would be in serious danger if in the water with one. They are amazingly fast swimmers so my advice is DO NOT SWIM IN THE SAC OR AMERICAN DURING SALMON SEASON. And if ur fishing during that time dont hang ur catch off the side of ur vessel!</Review>

With current concerns over light pollution in cities, it seems obvious that the Guy West Bridge "renovation" neglected to consult anyone with a forward thinking perception of the issue, let alone any possible aesthetic sensibility. What used to be a pleasant evening stroll to view the river and the night sky from the bridge is now a glaring blast of LED spotlights that make you want to shield your eyes, a gross oversight to such a handsome bridge.< /Text>

I was surprised when i saw sheriffs and campus P.D. in the middle of this bridge. When asked why are you guys crowded up on a bridge, they responded, we're doing a training mission. Hmmm... I said in dissaproval. Somebody could have told me what to do to help. But it seemed like a intimidation tactic. Because just the night before I got off the bus and attempted to walk through the campus to the bridge and was contacted bye 5 campus police officers who said that they were informed of 30 guns in my backpack and wanted to know if it was true. I snap back quickly no! I've I've been listening 2 Ice Cube and Eminem and decided to make my own rap while walking through the campus and they let me go. Hmmm...</Text>

While attending Sacramento State, I'd stroll across the bridge daily either before or after classes; frequently, I'd stop in the middle (more or less) of the bridge and enjoy the fresh air and the view up and down the river. Yes, you can say I've had a lot of fond memories there.</Review>

Good Pedestrian connector to Sac State/Midtown & Campus Commons and WAY better than the J Street sidewalk. Lots of pedestrians from CSUS. Best places to cross the river would be here, Watt Avenue, or Hazel Ave for pedestrians.<//text>

<Rating>4<//Rating><Review>Lots of space and separate enclosures fur big and small dogs. There is a working water fountain. The only issue is that there are no lights in the park. It's 5pm and the sun is almost setting and at least 6 dogs showed up only to be able to play for a short time due to the lack of light. It's seriously dark there.<//Review><time>1610923386667<//time></record></dataset><record>

What a great place to let your dog run free.  They have two areas, one for big dogs and one for small dogs.  You meet a lot of nice people too.< /Review>

Very nice dog park, well kept, both grass and tiled patio areas in small dog area, grass and hard surface (packed sand) areas in large dog area, quite a bit of room to run both large and small. Limited doggie exercise equipment pieces in both, both nice. Bonus: doggie pickup bags are supplied.</Text>

<Text>This place is absolutely amazing! My dog and I don't live in the area and happened to just be passing by, but what a great situation it turned out to be! My dog had such a blast with the other dogs! She loves all the dog structures and fake grass and everyone was so nice! This park has an area for humans and also separate enclosures for small and large dogs. It is also an easy accessible location with lots of parking. I will definitely return and recommend if I'm ever in the area.</Text>< pics>

They did a really nice job with this park.  Dogs have a great time running around and there is a large area for the humans to sit at with a roof so you don't get so hot!!</Review>

Every time I go to Armando's I am amazed with the artwork, the atmosphere, the beauty. I've only gone to a couple events there, but it is always a trip! I would recommend it to anyone visiting Redding.<//Review>

Stopped by late for a glass of wine. Armando was a wonderful host. The gallery is fascinating and eclectic. There is a story behind each piece he has collected and wonderful to hear about. Planning next visit soon.</text>

My other half and I have made it a weekly,sometimes bi weekly,date location. We absolutely love it here and enjoy the ambiance and extreme detail put into every experience. Every time there is something different, every week is a working peace of art.  Every dish is carefully put together down to small details. The flavors are perfectly paired.  There is nothing else in this area that can even compare. I highly recommend checking it out.  Perfect for a date night, special occasion or even just to pop in for a drink downstairs.  It's a must visit location!</review>

<Resp>None</Resp><Text>Armando's Gallery House....where to start?

The atmosphere is louder than a white tiger skin jumpsuit. The walls are entirelt Adorned with Armando's original paintings which are by a techinical terms, paintings. Armando himself is an armandk original painting. Yku will undoubtely know its him by his alarming tight red lether pants. Hopefully you get to experience the whole ensemble and catch him in his mesh tank top. Rjmor has jt that his nipples nsvsr chaffe dhs to their lactafjon of olive oil.<//Text>< Pics>

I like it because it's local but it's expensive compared to other beauty supplies and they don't allow returns or exchanges..

I don't like doing business anywhere I can't return or at least exchange an item... I bought hair for braiding that I ended up not being able to use because my braider said it would cut her fingers....It was never opened and I had the receipt and they wouldn't let me bring it back so I'm stuck with five packs of hair that I can never use...

If it was a wig or something I could see, but something in a package that has clearly never been opened you should at least be able to exchange!

This is a policy that is typical of a lot of Asian Merchants which is why I don't do swap meets and don't really like to patronize them because it's not the American way...

So due to their no exchange policy, I will not be shopping there again..< /review>

This is an Asian run store. Very clean...small and enough parking 2 get the job done. Very friendly people. I like prices checking.
Some of their prices r lower on certain items while higher on others.That seems 2b true with all such stores.</text>

Beautiful store. Well stocked,  friendly staff, owner is in the store and ready to help weather he needs to look for something or reorder it for next day delivery.  I would definitely be making it my daily Go to for my salon but it's a lil out of the way for more than a weekly visit. I will be back for sure and often<//Text>

<review>I've been searching for a wig store around my house for a while now and decided just go in here on a whim. Man, I'm so glad I did!! They have so many different types of wigs available-and they allow you to try them on (with the purchase of a $1 wig cap) which is awesome since not many places let you do that. I went in looking for something very specific-a yellow lace front wig and I mean a bright yellow. Instead of just telling me no they didn't have that, they actually took the time to look for some wigs that were similar. Despite not being a bright yellow, they ended up showing me one that I really loved so I went ahead and purchased it! They have this stamp card too that once you purchase 4 lace wigs, your 5th one is 40% off which is pretty cool-and I know I'll use it since I'm always buying wigs! I was really nervous going in here that the service wasn't going to be that great or that they wouldn't have anything I liked, but I was very impressed with this store. The customer service was amazing and their selection of products was huge! Besides just wigs, they also carry a ton of different beauty supplies like hair care products, make up and others things. Definitely my new favorite beauty supply store. I highly recommend it!< /review><gmap_id>0x80c2b556bfae5c25:0x1fcf03a85ac1971b<//gmap_id><pics>None<//pics><name>Ashley Doyen</name><user>107782760272744080492<//user>< rating>

Wish I could put 0 stars but unfortunately that isn’t an option. So I bought a wig from there that was supposed to be human hair. When it came down to dying it & bleaching it, nothing happened to the hair(mind you it was a profesional that has worked doing this for over 20 years that looked at this hair & tried bleaching it). She told me it WASN’T human hair ! Don’t buy wigs or bundles or anything from this place because they sell fake stuff y’all! Don’t waste your money, & be careful what you buy because they will not refund or exchange anything<//review>

I really liked the store until my experience today. I work across the street . But we didn’t have the product that I wanted so  me and my coworkers usually go there. So I wanted to buy a cap and apron, the cap prices at $3.99.. what a deal! I was going to buy them both with my discount. But the guy that’s always in the front ignored me when the girl rang me up and the cap price was different. I kept calling the man in the store that walked away from the girl and told her to charge me what it rang up. Not the price that was advertised. We then are going back and forth I tell him you have to honor the price advertised. He then begins to tell me Walmart make mistakes to you still go there... I’m like no that has nothing to do with it. He then goes to where the caps where and removes the price tag and tells me he’s going to fired the guy that did this. Again, that has nothing to do with me. I took a picture or the price tag earlier. He got mad after I showed him the picture, and said he was going to call the police! ( for what) I said do whatever you want. I told the girl at the register to just ring me up for the product I initially came in for and forget the apron and cap! He wouldn’t do it nor give the discount displayed for even that!! And asked me why I took the picture and he was calling the police!! And to go to my work and get the product.!!  I’m done!!!  Very ignorant, unprofessional, Unacceptable Behavior!!<//Text>

I went here last week for earrings and immediately felt welcomed, I bought one item and they were quick to sign me up for a beauty4U card for future discount purchases , I didn't feel lost. I got help from one of the employees,  It was a nice store with a variety of supplies. I definently plan on going back soon for some hair stuff .< /text>

Lots of products. Big place. A little expensive. And, I didn't care for the overly attentive, following my niece and I throughout the store.</Text>

Manager has a horrible attitude, wigs feel like Barbie doll hair, & sell nothing but cheap stuff. Save your money or go to the place on el segundo and Hawthorne blvd in the shopping center instead< /Review>

<Text>I don't know about the actual bus station but the surrounding areas, parking lot etc are overran with homeless, drug addicts, aggressive unstable people, dealers and I could go on and on. Its always trashy and very unsafe. The large bridge, running over j st connecting the bus station  parking area to the west of j street , has homeless with mounds of degree in shopping carts, etc in the 1st 2 levels, and dogs who bark loudly at the families and or young people trying to cross over it. Not safe at all.  What's happening to Tulare is disgusting.<//Text>< Pictures>

Took a trip on greyhound. Almost didn't because of all the negative reviews. Glad I did it anyway. I am partially deaf. I received nothing but friendly help at all the stops and exchanges of busses. Yes the bus was late on the way back from my trip, but that wasn't the fault of greyhound or it's driver. Traffic was horrible. Glad I wasn't driving and left it up to greyhound! The people was helpful and friendly. I had a very comfortable and worry free trip. Will gladly use greyhound for another upcoming trip. Thank you!</text>

< review>
Buses are always running late and it was not just on one occasion. I have gotten on this bus 6 times in the past 6 months and 5/6 times it was over 1 hour late which was the worse thing. They don't even apologize for making you wait in there terminal. They should do something about it.<//review>

< review>
This is a great spot - the concept is great, atmosphere is great the food is great. I am giving 3 stars because this place needs to really replace some of its staff members. Where are the smiles? I mean, give me a break! From some of them I get the vibe that they don't even care much. Also cleanliness in a food outlet is a must!  Some staff members look unkempt wearing whatever clothes and unclean. I get it that it's a casual spot, but you are touching my food and must have clean hands, clean clothes and maybe even gloves. Handle my food with love and care -  you are not doing me a favor preparing it! Job is a job - if it were a free or 1 buck eatery like Taco bell, I would care less and be happy with whatever and however you serve it to me. Definitely like the place but won't be back until these issues addressed.<//review>

<text>Good place for working. Lots of seating and outlets, but they only give you 2 hours of free WiFi. Sometimes the code does t work so you have to go back and forth to get new codes, but otherwise, still a good place. Coffee and tea are reliable. They also have pastries, which I haven't tried yet. Fresh OJ is really good too</text><date>1432943230189<//date></record></dataset><record>

Good, pretty typical coffee shop. Spent like two hours here working on my laptop and meeting with someone, everything was pretty laid back and not too crowded -- good for those coffee shop meetings, you know. Solid choice if you're in the area.< /text>

<Review>One of my favorite coffee shops to go to on the weekends, drink coffee, and work on stuff or read.  Awesome coffee from Chromatic (my old hangout when I used to live i the South Bay -- check them out too if you're in San Jose, they're awesome).  Really chill atmosphere, good food, good beer selection, free wifi, comfy couches, friendly staff.  Really great place.

Updated review: Sad to hear about this place closing.  It used to be a great coffee shop.  The last time I went there (some time in early 2016), they had changed ownership, and also changed where they buy their coffee beans.  As a result, their coffee was nowhere near as good as it used to be.  Maybe that spelled the end for them.<//Review>< pics>

Coffee is good and the space is nice. They serve sandwiches but nothing too exciting there. As for a lot of coffee shops, you always see people study or work from here, there are actual signs asking to only use big tables for more than 2 people.< /text>

Pros: Pretty decent food for a coffee shop. Homemade hummus is great and their bread pudding is awesome.

Cons: Uncomfortable chairs. Coffee is just average. Workers are really pretentious and unfriendly.</Text><Rating>3< /Rating>< Pics>

They make pretty good cappuccinos here and serve it in a ceramic cup if you have it to stay.  Nice spot to hang out away from the busy foot traffic on 4th street in SOMA.
I didn't eat lunch there but they seem to have some simple sandwich fare. I don't think I would be back for food, but it seems like a good quiet place to grab a decent coffee
and to sit down with a friend as it seems like they offer a variety of seats--table seating and couches.</Text>

They stood out in the variety of coffee style preparations that they had.  However a construction crew says that they are closed for a couple of months for a remodel until March 2017.<//Review>

Well prepared coffee and a chill atmosphere. When I'm in Mission or Hayes I go to Ritual, but this is my favorite spot in Soma.

Bonus: This is the only place I've been able to find that serves decent Cuban coffee since I moved here from FL.< /text>

The salad at Epicenter is good. The people there are really cool too and it's a great place to go for lunch. Also they have Mongo meetups which are helpful.</Text>

While a popular spot for young tech professionals, laptop use is impeded by limited power outlets and poor WiFi (which is low bandwidth and require a separate password per 1 hour block). The slips of paper they hand out with the WiFi password are a serious annoyance.

Depending on your carrier, cell service is spotty so personal hotspots are not a good option either, though you can often get an adequate signal in outdoor seating.<//Text><userid>109741359399131092509</userid></record></dataset><record>

I admit I only visited this place because I had a $5 coupon for it, but I was pleasantly surprised. Granted, all I had was some fruit because coffee makes me ill, and anyone would be hard pressed to mess up a plate of seasonal plant ovaries (which is what fruit is - think about it). I liked the place's vibe; it was spacious and bright, and had possibly the coolest table I'd ever seen in a coffee shop fashioned out of a huge map of the peninsula.

It was really busy, though, and there was only one guy behind the counter.  So it took a long time to get my fruit, but the guy was super apologetic about it, and i'm an understanding sort. I will be back, that is assuming the Big One doesn't hit before I can.  They're courting disaster with a name like that, especially since the cafe is located on "land," which, in this case, is short for "landfill."< /Review>

<text>TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE.

I have to say I've never written a negative review for any place, but I had a terrible experience there. I was going there intending to work for the day and have a coffee, some lunch, etc. I told them I just wanted to make sure the wifi was good before I bought something because I'm working here for the day and they wouldn't give me the code. Then I bought a coffee and they gave me a 1 hour pass and said I had to buy something every hour to continue the wifi. Then I asked for my money back because I wanted to go somewhere else and they wouldn't give me a refund.

Firstly I've never been to coffee shop that was this protective over their wifi, secondly I thought it was irresponsible for them to have not told about the limit when they knew I was planning to work here for the day. And the fact that they gave me attitude and refused to refund my money was very unprofessional.</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Gmap_id>0x8085807e5a2f2a9d:0x3bd9cfaa7042e506</Gmap_id><response>None</response>< Date>

Great place to work at. Fast internet but you need wifi codes to use it.

Love the startup vibe and you'll overhear people talking about startups all day.</review>

Refused to provide wifi to a colleague who was joining me and hadnt purchased a drink... Told me he would go out of business for providing free wifi... I beg to differ - you go out of business when customers refuse to come back. Wish I could vote no stars!<//text>

< Review>
If you're a movie buff wading through the $1.95 "buy ten get five free" section, you'll come across piles and piles of garbage. But be patient. Be persistent. Amongst all the muck, there's hundreds of little diamonds waiting to be uncovered, and sometimes the thrill of those discoveries are truly exhilarating. Pictured are 45 movies I found and got for less than 60 bucks one time. This doesn't even include some of the best stuff I've found on other days I've gone. I don't know of any other place in Fresno that deals in physical media with more value to the dollar than Rasputin's.

In addition to movies, I've also purchased quite a few records here. The value to the dollar you get for music is not as exciting as it is for the movies, but the selection is still excellent, and you'd have to scour thrift shops in Clovis to find a better selection of records than you'll find here.</Review>

Decent selection from a wide variety of genres in movies and music. They also sell t- shirts and electronic equipment. Great place to kill some time during a lazy afternoon. You're sure to find something cool and unexpected.< /review>

OMG!  It is Thursday, May 21, 2020 and the City of Fresno has just announced doing away with the City's shelter-in-place orders as of 12:02a.m. Tuesday, May 26 and all stores will be able to be open and back in business.  I am so psyched.  Am an avid customer of Rasputin Music in Fresno and am chomping at the bit to come in and start spending money again at your store.  I am hoping that you will be open again starting Wednesday, May 27, 2020.  We all need you back.< /text>

Great store, I collect music CDs and I always find good pickups here. I just wish they content was better categorized. Megadeth, Metallica, Pantera are all in Rock and not Metal which is the case for most classic metal bands and thats just crazy. Journey and Megadeth are not the same category no matter how you slice it. Still it's my favorite place to shop locally for music.<//text>

<text>Unbelievable that they've managed to stay open with how incredibly rude and snotty the staff is. I don't normally leave bad reviews, but my experience today takes the cake. They kept accusing me of being some random person I guess they didn't want there. They had absolutely NO proof. The smug staff guy said "I never forget a face!" I could tell that he was lying. He was so condescending and wouldn't tell me anything about what was going on, so for all I know he made it up. I'm really not sure if it was a real thing or if the guy was just on a power trip. I wouldn't recommend giving them your business if this is how they treat customers. There are better shops in Fresno with staff that actually acts professional. They actually threatened me and I don't wanna give my money to people that treat me like that, although I am a patient person so i did try to reason with them. By far they have the worst customer service I've ever seen and it's not worth the few dollars you might save.<//text>< pictures>

You never know what great films you’ll find for 50 cents to a dollar!! Other than that their films are well organized by categories and their staff are very willing to check to see if they have certain titles in stock. But...if you find a hard to find film you’ve been searching for get it! Otherwise it may not be there the next time. This happened to me twice.

AMAZING DEALS! Just went in the other day and they have DVDs for under a dollar! They have it all! Books, video games, t- shirts, music CDs,records, VHS, DVDs...you name it! Employees are definitely helpful. Set aside some time because it is VERY easy to get lost in the experience! This place is a true gem!!</Text>

There was a great selection of music and DVDs to choose from, however; the staff were rude and obnoxious. This was my first time at this business and probably my last.< /text>

Lots of variety, good prices and you can order anything you don't find. Have been going for several years and have had 1 movie return.<//Review>< Pictures>

<review>I so love Rasputin. The staff is always courteous and helpful when searching for CDs or DVDs,and their inventory is ginormous!! Especially love the discounted price on everything,it's a win win . I do manage to find everything I'm searching for there,sooner or later. Have purchased many CDs and only one had a defect,which I got store credit for.
Nice resource for all your vintage music and movies😁. Would recommend.< /review><UserId.>113976030635496701112< /UserId.><Rate>5</Rate>< date>

Been waiting for the store to open back up.. seen that website said they were open but after the drive across town I found out that they are still closed ☹️. They could at the very least email their members to let us know the status of the store< /review>

Not really a store for vinyl heads anymore. What they have is extremely over priced and every time I come here the selection gets smaller and smaller and smaller. Really don’t know where this store is going anymore, if its a movie store or a used CD store or book store?  They got a little of everything I guess but it used to be great for vinyl.</Text>

So this is the place where you can walk in with two dollars and walk out with entertainment. Whether you are into music or movies, TV shows, video games or just people watching there's always something. They have the coolest rock band t-shirts of all times. Give yourself time to roam around if you don't have any specific titles in mind. But if you do call ahead and ask them to hold it for you because things move quickly in here. Overall I like this store very much and recommend it for the whole family.<//text>

One of the last or couple last good record stores in this area. In the days where digital music is bigger than ever real record stores are hard to find. Rasputin has a fair selection of music, DVD's, clothing ,turntables and a couple books.</text>

It's a good place to find the very thing you weren't looking for. I go here to buy season DVDs and 90s music. It's a rummage sale in a contained area. They have very decent pricing on all their stock. I'll get Unbreakable, yet.< /review>

This place is fantastic. New stuff all the time. I know I can get stuff digitally but I enjoy the hard copies of music. Listening to the CDs as they originally intended. Plus I like the inserts too. Cool old school rock t-shirts as well.</review>

Excellent place for music and video selections. Fantastic prices, a huge collection to chose from, new and older selections. Give yourself at least an hour to value the assorted selections they. Great customer  service.  Old school brick and mortar shop.< /Text>

<Review>I've been here three or four times. It's a nice large store from California's glory days that undercuts Amazon on used blue rays. Ridiculously vast selection of clearance used CDs and vinyl (like a buck each). The store focuses more on entertainment media than fye and I'm rooting for it to keep popping against the remaining brick and mortar sources of recorded music and movies for sale.

Beats the Best Buy and Barnes and Noble by miles</Review></record>

Great selection of movies, CDs, and games, plus some other stuff. Honestly I just go for movies, great prices on most stuff in the store. The staff is always helpful, all you gotta do is ask for help when you see them, and they're right there< /Review>

Honestly? The young Lady helping me out at the register. Was amazing, went out of her way to find a dvd for my special needs daughter. After I purchased over $150.00 in cds & DVDs. She used her own money to buy my child a Rasputins staffs tshirt. My child will barely take it off. Thank you! 🖤✌🦇< /review>

<text>A great date spot for hipsters like my hubby and I :) they have great deals on used movies and CDs. We had such fun finding obscure items for super cheap and they have popular items as well for great deals. We ended up buying seven movies for under $10 and just loved the whole experience. My husband said it reminded him of vintage used record stores.<//text><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

First time in a Rasputins and I was floored by the variety. From movies to cds to their decent collection of vinyl. Found various things I wasn't really looking for. Got a DVD movie ive wanted for my collection amd also scored some really great deals on a few classic albums. Will definitely be going back many times<//review>

What's not to love than this treasure trove of CDs, vinyls, boomboxes and dirty DVDs for an extra touch of class? This establishment has seen my business since the Black Keys released "El Camino".

Merchandise is organized by alphabetical order for maximum convenience. Go easy on the staff or I'll break your knees, this place is ALWAYS neat and organized for YOUR convenience.< /review>

Organisation was confusing. Service was helpful but ended up frustrated because nothing I was really looking for was clearly sorted or marked.<//review>

<Text>This place has the best selection of music movies in the Fresno California area. It's nice to browse the selections CDs and DVDs and even vinyl albums. The vinyl album selection it's not too bad and they normally have latest releases for sale. They don't have much of a selection of used vinyl but there's other places for that. The compact disc music selection is incredible they probably have what you are looking for unless it's been out of production for a very long time. The selection of used and new movies in DVD and summer Blu-ray is really good too you can probably drop 40 bucks easily but take home a wide selection of movies< /Text>< Rate>

I prefer to avoid the impersonal experience of buying vinyl online, so this is generally my first stop. But I am always getting closed on when I come here due to their early closing times.

All kinds of odd things you won't find in other stores. A lot of obsolete albums...and they have a lot of vinyl too. And latest releases. Good deals and some that are a little pricy but they're right there in hand.< /Text>

Went to Rasputin's in SF when I was kid on a church retreat. Bought a few Marilyn Manson CDs for like $10. Have loved them ever since they started here and replaced Tower Records. If they don't have it, they can get it! :)<//Review>

I wish the organization was better because it can be a real you know what trying to find something specific.. But other than that, this is my favorite place to buy anything on a disc.. Good older movies for 50¢- $5 and of course newer ones too.<//review>

Why am i customer having to go get change of 100$ for you. If $100 breaks your bank are yoy really a business. Not only was i gonna get turned a awa but was told someone else was turned away. And when i came back for what i wanted to buy. Another guy was being told sorry we cant break 100$  someone in line helped him out. The staff only push the blame on the company. And when i ask for the manger to pass along my complaint, he turn the subject to the show i was buying. Theyve. Got money to buy movies to up the price on but not to make change. Stop with the sorrys and pushing the blame make your store better. 200 in single 100 in 5s and 10s and dont for get cjange to quarters dimes nickels and pennys.

Great selection of CDs and DVDs. Lots of band tees. Decent selection of expensive new Vinyl and some great used titles sometimes hiding in 50 cent - 1.95 bins. The staff morale and service could use some work. There always seems to be panhandlers out front, which isn't the stores fault but they're clearly not doing anything to prevent it. Not open late enough for a music store.<//review>

My husband and I enjoy shopping here, even though you can get everything on your phone or ipad, etc... its cool to still be able to look thru movies or cds to find the right one.  Plus they have an awesome selection to choose from, sometimes better than amazon on price.</Review>

< review>
Rasputin has the best hip hop collection out of all the record stores in town that I have went to. Not only that, but they have newer releases that other stores might be slacking on. They have some pretty special vinyls for anyone looking to collect. They have a good CD collection as well, but its pretty clear that rock is what Rasputin majors in. If you want rock, then just go here. They have something for everyone. Don't know if they have an anime section, but I wouldn't be surprised if they did. A lot of DVDs a person can buy too. Basically a collector of physical media. Don't really know about their service because I work better when people let me focus on what vinyls and CDs I want to buy, but its probably alright.< /review>

<username>Eric Castillo<//username><review>If I would have known that Rasputin had my childhood music here I would have been here years before a few days ago, I spent $560 in 3 trips rebuilding my childhood 90s rap collection and there prices are awesome as some of this stuff sells online for 5x to 10x their prices. Each day I went it was a different person providing me customer service but they did go above and beyond to help me find what I was looking for but the reason for the four stars instead of the five is; #1 : they do not offer a customer appreciation program such as buy 10 CDs get one or free buy 20 CDs get one free etc, and #2 : the CDs I was looking for that I was unable to find in the store they did not have a way for me to obtain them which would have been perfect because then I'd be done, such as ordering third party where you can pay upfront, they order, then they call you when it's in the store for you to pick up, that would of been perfect or another way would be is if they could take down our information such as name and phone number and the CD were looking for and as soon as it comes in they give us a call in an opportunity to buy it that would of also been a Perfect solution. I'm still missing about 10 CDs I need to complete my childhood collection. Either way Rasputin is a wonderful place to purchase CDs as their prices are on a variable so some of the CDs you're looking for you might be able to find used at a cheaper price here</review><Response>None< /Response><UserId.>116027507584385994706<//UserId.>< date>

<Review>They have so much to do and see here! Everything is very well organized and they have records, movies, video tapes, CDs, and even some video games. They do have a lot of stuff to look at and you can even listen to some of the stuff. The staff is very friendly and they always open up right on time and they always feels right on time so make sure you're there in between the closing and opening.< /Review>< Pictures>

I took some DVDs l no longer wanted. They actually buy your dvd's and it's either credit or cash...l enjoy finding hard to find cds. Sometimes you find really good bargains...<//Review>

< Review>
Usually happy here but recently went to trade in some DBZ movies & Chris the manager made my Husband & I feel like theives by saying he couldnt take them because someone had the exact ones to sell them but were stolen merchandise. But we had our Amazon history to prove it. We decided to leave without the trade. We went to F.Y.E. Better customer service and merchandise by far.</Review>

Rasputins Music is probably the best music and dvd store i have ever been to, i think i have been going there for about 5-7 years tops and yeah i think out of all the other stores its the best for me. The staff there is very cool and laid back and very helpful if your looking for something certain and they have the best selection ever. This store is 10/10< /text>

<review>I had ordered a LP and I called to check on the status of my order. They ordered it twice while I was waiting for it to come in. Then they wanted me to let them order it again, WTF would I want to do that.

Rasputins is one of the best music shops i have ever been to. I buy most of my records there and i always have the best luck there too, especially when i'm looking through the rap section. Best store in Fresno!< /review>

<text>Unfortunately this is the biggest record store in Fresno. They have good deals, and a pretty good selection....although, can't always find what I am looking for.

Staff isn't very knowledgeable about music.

They don't carry many officially licensed band shirts, seems weird that a music store would mainly carry knock-offs.</text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

"Meh".

Good place to go if you're looking for an old movie or one that isn't well-known. Honestly target or walmart would be a better option for new releases. It's a little musky in there and there's no real "help" from sales associates. Kind of disorganized but you can definitely find some gems here if you feel like hunting.< /Text>

As you walk into the establishment, you may (probably not, though) be greeted with an almost inaudible, "...hello." by one of the less-than-helpful staff. Upon searching through their selections of CDs, you may notice that they are merely MOSTLY alphabetized with random "D"s in the "C" categories, etc. Although the aforementioned lack of knowledge concerning the alphabet is indeed frustrating, it is the least of your worries. The next issue of concern is the actual price of their merchandise. Unless you are buying used items (even then, it may still break your wallet), be prepared to be high-balled out of your hard-earned cash. Granted, you may occasionally find something for under $7, but chances are the item - assuming its a disc - will be scratched to hell (hence, the reduced pricing). Moving on: if you plan on selling any VHS tapes, cassette tapes, CDs, DVDs, or Video Games, be prepared to be mocked with a smug scoff or out-loud chuckle. Also, make sure you weren't planning on buying anything with the money you assumed you would get, because they pay you literal pennies (I had planned on selling some video games around Christmas and - to my dismay - I was offered 5 cents for the majority of my items). In summary, sell your things on Amazon or eBay. Next issue of concern: don't bother applying for a job there. Not only does the establishment not take applications (literally...they don't have Rasputin Records job applications), but I've also been tipped off by a reliable ex-employee who informed me that they hire within a limited circle of friends, the "Rasputin family" network as it were. Nepotism at its finest. Lastly, the employees: the majority of the staff are rude and virtually unknowing about the availability of music in stock. Don't bother asking to see if something is in stock. You are better off looking yourself. Rasputin assumes a virtual monopoly of music in Fresno, and they are aware. Don't support Corporate America. Buy whatever you are searching for online.</review>

<text>Worst place to go to if you are actually passionate about movies, music or anything they sell such as furnishings and what not. The employees are not very knowledgable about movies or music and the store opens at 11am on top of all that. This place is terrible but when it comes to used vhs they can't be beat. I HATE THIS PLACE but until a mom n pop shop opens with all my favorite movies used then i have nowhere else to go.</text><Name>Joey Barron</Name></record>

great, great prices. large selection. something for almost everyone. a place where I can walk in and browse around without being bothered. i'm not going to ask if they have something in stock. if i can't find it, they probably don't have it. i'll find it elsewhere. and do you really think employees of an establishment such as this one will be nice and bubbly? get real. i'm fine with a simple "hey, man" and a "have a good day" while I make my purchase.<//text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Review>If you want expert customer service go to Best Buy and pay for it. If you actually want used crap a place like this is perfect, sure the employees won't win any nobel prizes for their personal care or outstanding conversational skills, but the place is named "Rasputin's Music" not "Ronald McWunderfuls Magical Palace".

I personally love a laid back place to get stuff and browse.

10/10, two thumbs up and all that.< /Review><user_id>117802393954824711847< /user_id><Time>1446051566623</Time></record></dataset><record>

<text>Best selection and a massive variety of DVDs (movies & tv seasons), VHSs, CDs, records, band t-shirts, and posters (along with cassette tapes). Prices are ridiculously great and they pretty much have anything you need...some of their DVDs date back to the 30s. And the atmosphere is solid; the staff really know their stuff and are super helpful. Basically, whenever people ask where they can buy these items, I always recommend Rasputin!< /text></record></dataset><record>

Great selection, good prices on used cds and dvds. They have new and used records. i must ad that due to having so many genres separated into sections it can be difficult at times to find cds of some bands, but sometimes it can make it easier. Find your favorite band tshirt. love this place...love places like this.<//Review>

This is a great place to find old CD's, DVD's and blu-ray's. I wish they had a greater selection of blu-ray's but I am assuming this will grow in time. If you are old school and still like listening to CD's, you will find a very large collection as well as DVD's. You can definitely spend a long time browsing their selection and do some major damage to your wallet. I will look here first before purchasing a new CD or blu-ray.<//Review>

The staff is nice but their pricing for buying used dvds is horrible. I took in 3 Disney movies all were released 3 years ago and they wanted to give me $1.75.</text>
