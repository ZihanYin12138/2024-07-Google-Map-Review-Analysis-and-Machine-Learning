<Text>I really used to enjoy coming over here to get my family and I a good boba smoothie but man have they gotten expensive! They've raised the prices enormously it's insane. It's more than a gallon of gas. $3.49 for a regular size and I paid almost $6 for a stinkin' large which wasn't even as large as the other places I've gone to. They tack on more for extras as well. Bring cash if not they'll tack on another fee! Card fees! Ridiculous.

I'm never coming here again. I'd rather wait to get my boba fix when I'm down south. Seems like when something becomes popular here in town the business owners thinks it's okay to rip customer's off. You know if you want to keep your customers happy this is not one of them. They just lost my families business. They're not even the greatest boba cafe in town anyways. They don't even have a wide variety of flavors. In San Diego boba cafes they have a plethora of flavors. It's a good thing I know another place to get some good boba and not for the cost of gas prices here in Bakersfield.

We've tried the food as well and I would pay there prices at all anymore. We just mainly came for boba drinks.</Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOSQOGgkZ6Ia87Qqka3K6N9lC4hmDOEekoYQfIs=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< Resp>

Food was not the best, there is no option to substitute any of the meats you don't like. They have chicken and ribs teriyaki, but No beef teriyaki, which is rare that this happens in restaurants.
The Boba drinks taste better than the food, I guess.<//Text>

<Text>Although their food was good and I would probably give them a 4.5 or 5 it's just you have to spend $10 and they charge you $0.50 they Knick knack you to death. When it was managed by the other owners it was a hell of a lot better. I spent $40 in food I feel like I got $15 worth of food.< /Text>< time>

Been here many times for hot wings and I love coming back when I can as House of Wings has the best wings I've tried in all of Bakersfield, and I've tried a lot of different places. Owner and staff are very kind and friendly. Of course they don't only sell hot wings, they have a variety of things on their menu and everything I've tried have all been great. I love getting hot wings along with curly fries to eat with my family.< /review>

I truly love this place! The meat is always tender yet well cooked. Flavors are great!I like the lemon pepper wings. In 20 minutes your meal is usually done. So I call ahead if I'm going to pick up or I dine in when I'm on a time limit. Did I say this place is great!!!</Review>

This place has been on my radar for quite a while but I never pulled the trigger because I’m pretty loyal to my usual favorite wing spot in town. But one day I had some time free after a photoshoot so I decided to give it a shot. I ordered a ten-piece lemon pepper because let’s be honest… lemon pepper is the only flavor that matters. The wings were A-MAZING!! Hot, fresh, a good size, perfectly fried with the perfect amount of lemon-pepper. Could this be my new favorite wing spot? Well not so fast… I like to give a new place at least three chance before I proclaim anything because anyone can have a good day and anyone can have a bad day, hits and misses happen everywhere.

The second time I went there I got a twenty-piece. Now… the wings were good BUT they didn’t have that same magic as the first time and they were also a little undercooked. Not by a lot, but a self proclaimed wing connoisseur like myself can tell. See what I mean about the “hit and miss?” So I went back a third time and this time I got a meal. I believe it was the five piece with the fries and drink. Now here’s where this place rubbed me the wrong way. Each of the two other times I was helped by a younger women and I was just charged my meal. This time it was an older woman and she told me that if I wanted to use my credit card I would be charged .50. I work for an indie mom & pop store in town so I understand WHY the CC charge, but either they charged me that free the first two times and didn’t say anything… OR they pick and choose which customers they charge the .50 fee. And I didn’t see that posted anywhere (yeah, I looked)

This is the type of inconsistency with businesses that drive me crazy. Admittedly I’m hyper-sensitive about this because of… certain reasons. But if you’re going to charge a CC fee then 1. Make it public and 2. Make sure all your employees do this. Otherwise it seems random and unfair. Three visits all within ten days. And even though I LOVE their wings, I haven’t been back because of this. If I do go back I’ll bring cash just so I don’t have to bring this up and cause an awkward situation.<//text>

I was on Panama wanting a smoothie before I headed back home to Arvin, I stumbled upon this place by accident and didn't expect much. I literally just enjoy drinking something while I'm driving longer distances. I ordered a Thai tea smoothie with boba, and as I walked out and took my first sip, I was amazed! The smoothie was amazing! My only complaint was the drink almost looking like ice cream rather than a smoothie. It was a little under blended, as halfway through the drink, I started noticing chunks of ice come out through the straw, but I was just so amazed by the taste that I didn't really care.< /Text>

<Review>It's a very good casual, modern Korean style restaurant, and I highly recommend it for non-Koreans. However, food (particularly the bbq plates) is too salty, service slow, and portion doesn't justify the 14 dollar price tag.<//Review><user>114959995892515070234<//user></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
I had milk tea boba and it was terrible. Boba had a bad texture and the tea was not great either. I am spoiled in LA with world class boba shops, but just wanted to let the world know that this wasn't one of them. Also, the price was 4.01. I couldn't use my credit card without a 50 cent fee and there was no penny bin. I asked if she could just ignore the penny, but she didn't answer and proceeded to give me 99 cents change. That's the price, so fine, but who sets their price of one of the two items in their freakin Name to be 4.01, and then discourages use of credit cards?<//Review>

<text>There were a small selection of the shirts we went to the store for.
The sides of the racks displayed sizes with arrows, but the shirts in the small section were XL and most others did not match.
After finding a XL shirt, we could not find the same shirts in smaller sizes.
I have shopped at this store often, going back to when it was a 5 for $10 shop.  It has changed a lot.  It might be a good place for other things, but not what we went for today.<//text></record></dataset><record>

Probably the best small business store in chino. Great family workers. Can always ask for their honest opinions. I’m making this review to show how much I appreciate their store.< /Text>

My husband loves this place because they sell Pro Club clothing and have up to 5x size shirts. They also sell accessories like earrings, body jewellery, snap back hats, belts, and bandanas. They have some items for women and kids also. We always feel welcomed when we shop there, they are always very helpful and nice.< /Text>

Not the friendliest customer service but, my husband wanted to visit this place because he remembered going here as an adolescent. The prices were fair for the bundles of the socks. They had an assorted variety of textures and styles that my children enjoyed viewing.<//Text>

This is emargency place to go buy t-shirts.

Pro club t-shirts are sell by size their more than $10.00 each I can go to the Paramount outdoor swap meet  and buy 3 white 2xl pro club t-shirts for the same price.

Shaka t-shirts they sell only on black and white the price are the same by size I can buy 4 2xl Shaka t-shirts at the Montclair outdoor drive through swap meet for half of the price when I buy 4 in there.

Now don't get me wrong like anything else it's it's downs but it has its ups.
Meaning not everything is bad.

If u want Locs glasses they have all Cain's of frames and different styles at way better price from any liquor store, swap meet or mall. A lot of earrings of any Cain for a fair price.< /Text>

< Review>
I usually love this place. No complaints with the food. That never disappoints.
However, when trying to place an order for pick-up the website indicates the restaurant is only taking phone orders and when I did attempt to call (for over 30 minutes) their line was busy. I informed the hostess upon my arrival, she stated she had no idea why the phone wasn't working would mention it to her manager. Also, the website shows one version of their menu when it is an extremely limited in actuality. It was very disappointing being that I'm not from area and made the almost 1 hour drive to learn I couldn't order my favorite items. Please fix your phone issues or update your website. It could've save me a trip.< /Review>

1st Impression:
From the outside it looks like it got a lot of space but once you go in, you realize that the space is only long but not far in. Making larger groups hard to be seated.
Other than that, the bar area and overall ambiance is nice and clean.

Food Impression:
The Pan Roast here is ok but I've had better in other places.
This one still cannot compare to the Oyster Bar located inside Palace Station in Las Vegas.
The heat numbering is a joke. I ordered a 7 while a friend of mine ordered a 8 (1 to 10), we both barely got any heat on our Pan Roasts and Gumbo.

Price Impression:
The price is about the same with other places that serves the same type of food but because of the lack of quality, it's just ok.

Conclusion:
Better save your money and try somewhere else than here. The cost is not worth trying an ok place for Pan Roast.<//Review>

What do you get when you cross an owl with a bungee cord??

............................My ass!! BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA

Free appetizer with any entrée purchase coupon

Ritter's Steam Kettle Cooking serves up authentic Creole cuisine, utilizing individual jacketed steam kettles to evenly cook food at varying temperatures.  I've had this place on my radar for awhile now, and lunch seemed the perfect opportunity to stop by.

While the restaurant seems small, the table & bar seating can accommodate around 30 people.  Flatscreen TV's had international soccer & soap operas for my viewing pleasure.

A complimentary crusty bread roll w/ butter greeted me as I gave the menu a once over.

For my free appetizer, I went with the deep fried bacon wrapped molasses marinated shrimp & mozzarella with molasses mustard-
Bacon & shrimp, two of my favorite food groups.  Large, tender shrimp wrapped in smoky, fatty bacon, with a delicious mustard for dipping.  If that's not enough, gooey mozzarella cheese just for the hell of it.  Some hot sauce kicked up the molasses mustard to my liking.

For my entrée, I chose the clam pan roast (spice level 7)-
Tomato cream base with Cajun trinity & jasmine rice.  A rainy day comfort food.  Rich, hearty, stick to your ribs kind of dish.  The level 7 spice level was just right for me, providing heat while still allowing me to taste all the bold flavors encompassed in the bowl.  Plenty of sweet clam swimming in the tomato broth, a scoop of fluffy rice wading in the middle.  My only complaint, and it's more a personal preference, is next time I'll ask for rice on the side.  Reason being is that I'm not particularly fond of soggy rice.  As I got down to the last few bites, the soggy rice grains became unappetizing to me.  But, the large portions & tremendous flavor have made me a fan.

Beignet with chocolate whipped cream-
I've only had beignets previously at Ralph Brennan's Jazz Kitchen, and Ritter's seemed more dense & textured.  The chocolate whipped cream was ambrosia to me.  With a liberal slathering on top of the fried dough calorie buster, the flavor was heavenly.  Perfect way to end the meal.

Service was great.  I was attended to promptly & had plenty of soda water w/lime refills.  Parking is metered in the front, with a structure available nearby.  The parking structure is only $2 for the first two hours.

C'est si bon!  Ritter's Steam Kettle Cooking offers delicious Creole cuisine in a relaxing atmosphere.  I'm highly anticipating coming back & trying their other dishes such as jambalaya & chowder.  Besides beignets, Ritter's also offers bread pudding a la mode and that has my undivided attention for my next visit.

Highly recommend!

We have been here twice and honestly the food is just okay. Don't expect a Creole twist with the seasoning on your food because you won't get it. My friend was disappointed in the gumbo but the chicken with the noodles with cilantro and ripe tomatoes was really really good.< /text>

One of my favorite Cajun restaurants ever. Highly recommend the fried okra, chowder fries, and the blackened salmon salad. If you go during happy hour the appetizers are a couple bucks cheaper and you get to try everything they have to offer. Excellent service, super attentive server and chef. Loved loved it!<//Text>

Food was so flavorful! Had the house pan roast, did not disappoint. Had plenty of shrimp,lobster, and crab. Also had the calamari. We will be letting our friends and family know about this delicious restaurant. Coming back to Huntington just for Ritter's! Was shocked that this restaurant was not crowded giving that the food is this good.<//text>

One of the more unique food experiences you can get in downtown Huntington Beach. It is sort quaint (small) but one of the few places with counter service where lone diners can eat without taking up a table and stares of other patrons. The service was very attentive and helpful. I had the pan toast and had the chowder before and intend to get the gumbo in the future. Of the 2 I have had, I prefer the chowder, but it appears the pan roast is most everyone else's favorite.</text>

Very friendly and knowledgeable staff. Took the time to explain the dishes and the process for making the meals. The food was excellent and very reasonably priced. We ordered the fried okra, the chicken and shrimp gumbo, and the bread pudding.  The only suggestion I have for any of the food was a dash of salt to the gumbo.  Highly recommended!< /Text>

Came on a Saturday night. Small cozy place but there was space so we didn't have to wait long. Servers seemed overworked or preoccupied. We ordered a seafood kettle and an appetizer. We had to ask for bread as apparently it doesn't come with any. The food was okay but we likely won't be coming back. Better options elsewhere in downtown.< /review>

Great type of food for the cold weather and large portions to share. Food is unique and delicious. The style of cooking on steam kettles is so interesting to watch and it keeps your food hot longer without over cooking it. If you haven't tried it yet you should!!!< /Review>

<Time>1563589811946<//Time><rate>4< /rate><review>I had the Cajun Calamari and the New England clam chowder bowl which were both very good and came in a good enough portion to share with another person. I also had the Diablo shrimp pasta bowl which was also big enough to share. It had 6 medium shrimp, about a 20 count/lb size and I had it at an 8/10 heat level. The prawns were a good texture, not overcooked and the heat level was nice and not overpowering. I will say that they red sauce was very basic and left me wanting something more complex but that's not to say it wasn't good just not great. I finished up with some beignets for dessert which were made great, fluffy and crispy on the outside but still slightly doughy and soft on the inside with a pocket of air.  These were served with plenty of powdered sugar and a light chocolate mousse which topped them nicely.< /review><pics>None</pics>< resp>

Kinda of a smaller place but kid friendly. They have a descent but small selection of beer and wine. The bowl are large enough to share and their appetizers are a highlight if you have a few drinks. Nice place, is come back. There are not too many steam kettle restaurants around and they have done a good job with the menu options</Review>

It was slow when we came in,  so I can't really speak to overall service.  However,  with that said, my service was excellent.   My order was make incorrectly and it was remedied quickly.  I had the cioppino. I would say it was no more than a 4 out of 5.  I think that's fair due to having had much better broth than this and the white fish is a muddy tasting lake fish (that just doesn't belong in a ocean based soup, in my opinion).  However,  I enjoyed it.  The sweet tea was also very good and my cup never went empty.   I wasn't blown away and I would come back if someone else wanted to go.< /Review>

Great place and waiter was awesome! I had a shrimp po boy, which was proper and awesome and a few beers.  Waiter was tall friendly Asian dude who was on point in suggestions and service.  Others can learn from his example.  It pays to just basically be friendly. And the great food helps< /Review>

<Review>Every time we try and go here there's an issue with it being closed. This morning we came at 11:30 right on the dot, paid for parking and the cook had to let us know there was no waiter there yet so they wouldn't be opening until 12. So unprofessional.< /Review>< time>

<userid>101687416398961908796< /userid><review>I've passed by this restaurant this many times and never knew that it served Cajun food. I love Cajun food so when I found out, I just had to try it.

I got the jambalaya and my friend got the gumbo.the food came our surprisingly quick for Cajun cuisine and I was a little wary, but it was all for naught.

They give very generous portions and it was delicious all the way through. They didn't skimp on the meat and it was very flavorful and had a nice spicy kick to it. The meal was priced very reasonably for the portion that they give you.

Overall, definitely recommend it to anyone who wants Cajun!<//review><rate>5< /rate>< pictures>

Pretty good place for a southern taste.

The restaurant is a bit small, holding maybe 40 people at most. It's a cozy place though. They have nice decor and have their cooking stream pots lined up along the bar. It actually gets kinda hot sitting at the bar when they cook.

The food was good. We had their oysters and their house pot roast. I felt that the oysters were fresh. The pot roast was good as well. The amount of lobster and shrimp was substantial and it tastes overall very good.

Overall, it is a bit pricey but it may become my goto place for oysters.< /review>

This is the perfect place to get some creole classics served up fresh, fast, and right in front you (if you sit along the counter). This was a really unique experience as I'd never been to a place with steam kettle cooking and they have several of them lined up that they use to prepare their liquid based entrees. Overall, service was good and the food is flavorful! If you love seafood and food that has soul, then this is for you!< /Text>

Our food was good. Our server was pleasant. However they close at 9. But by 8:15 they started putting the chairs up on the bar. We tried to order desert but they had already shut the kitchen down. This was odd because the Huntington Beach street fair was going on and people were everywhere. Basically I am disappointed in feeling pushed out before closing.<//Text>

<Text>Best Cajun food in Huntington Beach! Try the Ritter's Famous Pan Roast. It's actually Cajun Seafood in Tomato Cream with Rice. Delicious! They also have all of your standard New Orleans food such as Jambalaya and Gumbo. Actually would be a good date night sitting at the counter watching the cook using the steam kettles.<//Text><response>None< /response><username>Simon Kaulius< /username>< gmapID>

This place needs help. I don't understand why businesses like restaurants promotes and spend advertising dollars but not provide enough staff to man the place when they have the costumers start coming in. Costumers waited and leave because of the long wait, costumers that's been seated don't get service and those ready to pay cannot find their server. Even delicious food taste bad if the service is lousy.</review>

<Review>It was a different and enjoyable experience. Food was delicious. I expected more from the deep fried oysters but I guess not everything tastes better fried. New England clam chowder, house oysters and the famous house pan roast was delicious.< /Review>< Pictures>

Food is a bit expensive but it's really delicious! I always get their jambalaya or their specialty, pan roasts. Soo soo good with so much flavor! I like to sit at the counter and watch them cook because that alone is a fun experience. That's if you're into cooking and kitchen designs.</Review>

On a chilly night, this is a special treat of warm comfort food as hot you like it to your spice level.  Seafood filled chowers and pan roasts.  Fun appetizers like fried pickles.<//text>

<Text>Would have never found this place if it wasn’t for google. It is truly a hidden gem ! The house pot roast is heaven !! The spice levels are not extreme I got a 6 out of 10 and it was very mild for me but all around I will forever be thinking of this place ☺️< /Text>< pics>

< Review>
Honestly, if I could give zero stars I would. My husband and I usually go to the Santa Ana location but decided to give this one a try for our anniversary dinner. We were very disappointed. Staff was extremely rude. We were told to sit wherever, and someone came and tossed the menus on the table without saying a word. The host also reached over me twice, once was over my purse (very uncomfortable for me) to get something on the counter in front of me, second was to hand my husband bread but he did so over my plate instead of walking to where my hubby was sitting, not once did anyone say excuse me. The food also tasted horrible, not at all how it should taste, they also got hubby's food order wrong, he ordered the gumbo with everything in it but pretty much only got fish and an odd piece of chicken. We will never return to this location. If you want to eat at Ritter's PLEASE go to the santa ana location!

Do yourself a favor and order the chowder fries!!! They are awesome!!! The gumbo was great too, though when we asked for a 10 in heat we expected it to be spicy, it wasnt at all, but it did have great flavor!< /review>

Wow... the HB location ...server was nice, but service was terrible...one server, one cook and one other guy on the sidelines... to handle the ENTIRE restaurant. Food was ok... definitely gone downhill since they opened... $90 tab for 2 people and the whole experience was quite disappointing....won't be back.</Text>

After a long break, on a rare rainy day, we decided to return to ritter's. Friday evening was fairly busy, with just one waitress for the entire place, though service was great. Our food was, unfortunately, bland and flavorless. It's such a shame because this place is typically good.< /text>

I really enjoyed my whole experience here. Not only was the food delicious but the atmosphere was fun and inviting. We sat in the bar area, which I personally love because it is very close to the steam pots that they use to cook the gumbo and pan roasts. Like the other review says, it does get really hot from all the steam but it smelled great as well. We got oysters and the seafood pan roast. Both were delicious and enough to more than fulfill the appetite of two fatties. They are also presented very aesthetically so get your instagram ready! The price is mediocre, pretty much the same as any other southern cajun restaurant.  ~$20 for the house panroast (highly suggested) and $18 for a dozen oysters.< /review>

<text>Very good for a fast casual bite of Cajun country. If ordering the gumbo or jumbalya I recommend going with a 6 or 7 on spice to add better flavor< /text></record>

<date>1458947182079<//date><rate>4</rate><Review>Yeah boi!!!  I was so excited to try Ritter's and I commented how similar this place is to the oyster bar in Las Vegas. Well there is a connect since Mr Ritter had experience at the oyster bar. I was so excited to try some of my favorite dishes except without oysters.
You can never go wrong with seafood and booze. The only downfall I didn't realize there was free street parking so I ended up paying for parking in the lot. Bummer but now I know to look around. This event was smaller but it was filled with "great service" which usually means cute waitresses but it was both the literal and figurative meaning. You can't beat service with a smile. I also enjoyed how every dish was explained to us and served family style. So much food! Don't worry it’s okay to indulge during the holidays we have until next year to make resolutions.

I enjoyed the fried shrimp and various soups. I enjoyed the seafood noodle but the gumbo and pan seared orange soup the best. Also adding habenaro peppers was both a hot and enlightening experience. Hello! Forget coffee put a little habenaro in your food and you won't be sleepy.<//Review>< Pics>

Never got to eat at this place. They closed up at 7:55 pm on a Saturday night. Too much of a cheap ass place to stay open until their regular closing time of 9:30 pm. Very disappointed and will not consider going there again no matter how good the food is.</Text>

(Translated by Google) The place was very pleasant, simple to have a snack and walk on. We ordered House Gambo level of sharpness 6, big wave beer tasty light 4.4%, shrimp scampi not sharp chose, delicious hearty. I advise

(Original)
Место очень понравилось, простенькое чтобы перекусить и гулять дальше. Заказывали House Gambo уровень остроты 6, пиво big wave вкусное легкое 4,4 %, shrimp scampi не острые выбрали, вкусно сытно. Советую</review>

I’m Saddened that this Place closed down. Just yesterday I saw how empty inside. I really don’t know the details but it must’ve been something bad for them to close the restaurant down. The food was great, the owner is very attentive, and Not to mention the great waitress. Good luck< /review>

<Text>I really lik(ed) this place, it (was) amazing, but I just went by at 6 pm on a Sunday and they were lights out. And I called and and their message said they will be closed for the holidays and will open again Feb. 3rd?  It's the 9th?  Closed permanently?
Edit: called again and their number is no longer a number.<//Text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

<Text>A great place to eat. The food is great, I've had most of the usual items off the menu. Everything I had was of a superior taste and quality. The service is great and Karen is particularly charming. The owners are always saying hello and chatting with the many regulars and are attentive to new faces. Other places may have more ambiance but so what? I have the lunch buffet whenever I am in town. And I will be going there today for an Xmas treat.< /Text><pics>None< /pics><response>None<//response><GmapID>0x8091e3c629ab24f9:0xfc859e71f9197d98< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Text>We picked this restaurant based on high reviews. We ended up leaving without ordering due to poor food safety and cleanliness. Our eating area was dirty, and we watched the waitress walk around with heavily soiled gloves, touching everything around the restaurant, which included our drinks, clean napkins, and utensils; I then watched her bring out a customer's soup bowl, touching the inside rim with her dirty gloves that she still hadn't changed. Food looked and smelled good, but I couldn't stay and eat if this is how they handle their food.< /Text>< Pictures>

Just had food delivered.
So disappointed, recd a half of a container of sweet and sour shrimp, burnt fried rice and chow mein with bean sprouts ( I order with no bean sprouts). I could go on.....
We use to order from China Garden all the time. I think this will be the last $63.00 they get from me....<//review>

<Review>I can't review the food, as I never had an opportunity to try it after placing a delivery order at 7:34 and not getting a phone call until 8:40 to tell me that was too late for a delivery order, my food was never made, and was not coming. That is terrible customer service, and the website does not offer a cut off time to place delivery orders.</Review><pics>None<//pics>< name>

It is not like the normal dry chicken stuck on sticks. It is in a sauce and absolutely tender and delicious. We had our order delivered and it arrived fast and very hot. A good touch that some places forget when delivering to a motel, they brought plates forks spoons and napkins. We would definitely order from them again if we get to Gilroy.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None</response><GmapID>0x8091e3c629ab24f9:0xfc859e71f9197d98<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

We had theHouse Deluxe Won Ton Soup (large $7.55), Coconut Shrimp ($12.25), Moo Shi Pork ($7.95) and Egg Plant in Brown Sauce ($7.75).

Each was quite good.

The brown sauce was better than at most Chinese restaurants.

As expected, there is good value here.

Service was good, but with the take-out and delivery business, they could have used an additional service person that evening.

The only negative here is that the restrooms were clean, but really need a remodel.

We'd come by again when we are in the area.<//text>< pics>

<Text>I’ll get straight to the point: cold food, bad service, way overpriced. The owner was sued by his employees for lost wages recently. Since he has fired his chef and original staff. He is now cooking and the “supreme burritos” we ordered were not supreme at all. We were given, and I counted, 6 chips in the basket in the beginning with  under half empty salsa bowls. Save yourself the bad service and food and go somewhere else.< /Text>< Pictures>

<Text>Our experience was less than desirable. We went towards the end of the night but there were several other people dining and coming in. The food seemed very old and the "sauce" on our dishes was coagulated and gross. One dish was hardly warm. Our server was friendly but very preoccupied with another table. We were unable yo get refills until she brought the check. She didn't ask how our food was and didn't seem to care that we hardly even touched most of it. She offered to go boxes but forgot to bring them. (Which was ok as we didn't want the food) Prices were high for quality. We visited this location based on reviews since we were just passing through but I couldn't recommend them.</Text>< pictures>

The proximity of this place to Cal Skate makes it a great mom hangout for when the kids are at a skate party and you're non party mom. The top shelf margaritas are so good and the pitcher is a great value. I dream about their cheese enchilada. Friendly, attentive service, too!<//review>

The food was horrible. Expensive and crusty coveted in old dried on top mole or done rank sauce. ( it was at the end of the day). We were on a special vacation and googled this and it was rated good. They sent out their  burly dishwasher to gather dishes, whom didn't speak just grabbed stuff. Wouldn't go here again ever or recommend.<//Text>

<text>Ambience is nice, service is good + accommodating (willing to make a substitution), but food just ok (few specifically vegetarian options, overcooked rice, salsa that's served with entrees seemed almost like plain tomato puree, fish was a bit salty, we weren't asked what style of beans for any of the entrées and were served refrijitos... our bad on that--but if we'd been asked we would have made another choice).< /text>< Pics>

<review>Tonight was our second time here, we actually live in all the way out in Forestville but we decided that it wasn't worth it to try a Mexican spot closer and risk disappointment when we knew the first time we tried it that Charros is a special place.  tonight we had a burrito and i had a tostada with carne asada and a side of rice and beans.
Both were delicious, we ate every last bit.
We will always return!<//review>< pictures>

UPDATE 2/5/18: My last two visits here I got a carnitas burrito supreme, no guacamole. Both times the burrito was lacking in flavor. The carnitas was surprisingly dry and bland. On the first occasion they did not add sour cream so the next time I specifically asked for sour cream....the provided it on the side. Again the burrito was bland and dry. Changing my review to 3 stars for now. One more visit and if my experience is poor again it'll be a very long time before I eat here again.</Text>

Got a couple items appraised here and they were very quick but thorough with their appraisal. The appraisal cards you get are very nice. I later asked them to revise the appraisal to include my name on it for insurance purposes and they did so quickly and sent a digital copy as well! Thank you!!<//text>

<text>After researching local options for servicing my Rolex Explorer II I found The Watch Buyers Group from a Google search.  It was initially a bit disconcerting to ship my watch across the country to a dealer I was unfamiliar with but after their first communication email regarding the process my mind was at ease.  These folks are perfect communicators and there are no surprises or hidden charges.  The value of service they provide is second to none. I received my watch back today in the time frame they estimated and it is in PERFECT, new condition.

Look no further for luxury timepiece sales and service.  They’ve earned a customer for life in Sweet Home Alabama.

Thanks so much!</text>< Rating>

I cannot recommend this business more highly. I had trepidation about shipping my Submariner to an unknown business but after researching and reading the reviews, I decided to go ahead. I just got my watch back last night and I couldn’t be more pleased. Reasonable cost and exceptional service. You will not be disappointed. Thanks to everyone there! I will be using your services again!< /text>

Can't say enough about TWBG!  My Rolex Submariner had not been serviced since I purchased it in 1996.  After doing some research I really went into this with a great deal of confidence.  From the time they received the watch to when they shipped it back the communication and updates were impeccable.  I was blown away when I got my watch back.  It looks like the day I bought it...thanks so much.</review>

They are truly a class operation. I was in need of an appraisal and they exceeded my expectations. Everything about the transaction was perfect. They did what they said and provided top-notch service. I will be doing business with them again. Thank you.<//Text>

<Text>They are highly professional and reputable.  I unfortunately had water damage to my Rolex and due to Covid could not get it serviced promptly.
Unfortunately, the watch was damaged beyond repair, but I was advised of all steps from receipt, to the watch being put in the dehumidifier to photos of the rust.  Watch was returned as requested and I have never seen such incredible packaging.  All this with no charge for shipping.  Next time I need service, will definitely use them.<//Text>< user>

<Response>None< /Response><Review>I, too, was leery about sending my Rolex watch across the country to a store (The Watch Buyers Group) I hadn’t heard of and physically couldn’t walk into.  All of my previous services were performed at the NYC Rolex service center. I read outstanding customer reviews and decided to give them a call.  To my surprise Ben spent 20 minutes with me reviewing all steps involved with servicing my Rolex, their insurance and mailing directions to ensure a safe arrival at their store.  (All mailing cost and insurance are covered both ways, as long as you follow explicit directions)  Within a week of receiving my watch, a detailed list of service items, both required and suggested was provided, along with the cost for my approval. Upon authorizing the repair, it was clearly explained the service would take 6-8 weeks, as they only use genuine Rolex parts and if I couldn’t wait that long, please ask for my watch to be returned.  TWBG does not request payment until the service is complete and your Rolex is ready to be returned.
Today, my Rolex was returned to me via FedEx.  The watch was triple boxed, with enough protection to ensure it’s complete safety.  My Rolex looks as perfect as the day it was purchased in 1986!!!  There’s not a scratch on it and the gold and stainless jubilee bracelet looks brilliant. In addition, the service includes a 5 year warranty, with shipping included both ways.
In summary, TWBG’s service is as good as a Rolex authorized service center, at half the cost!  Give them a try and your only issue will be figuring out what to do with the money you saved.</Review>< gmap_id>

These guys are such pro's.  I sent them my Rolex Submariner for an tune-up because it was running slow.  I followed the instructions and shipped it by mail.  They sent me back an estimate which I approved and fixed the watch.  It is running beautifully now.  They also cleaned and polished the band (unexpected and highly appreciated).  I would recommend.  A word of caution - They are SLOW and even more so now with Covid.  If you want a quick turnaround, bring to your local Rolex dealer (and pay the price).  If you have a spare watch and don't mind waiting, these are the guys for you.< /Text>

<review>I purchased my first Rolex in 1972 and have owned a number of them since that time. My watches have ranged from a mans model 1601 date just in gold and stainless steel to a 18kt President. I generally like the gold and stainless steel Submariner the best. I purchase the gold and stainless steel ladies date just for the females in my family when they graduate from a university. I have spent a long time looking for honest and reliable places to have the watches serviced. To be honest I don’t like paying close to $1,000 to have a watch serviced by Rolex.

I recently discovered The Watch Buyers Group and had them service one of my Submariners. Upon inspection they determined I needed a little more than their $395 cleaning and service. This did not surprise me because I wear my Rolex watches all day, everyday. If I need to work on one of my cars I seldom take off the Rolex while I do it.

I received an estimate shortly after sending the watch to them. I could have had them clean and service the watch for the basic price, but I chose to gave them add some parts to make it look like new again. I have been very happy with their work and would not hesitate to recommend to anyone.<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><gmapID>0x80c2c64b37630263:0xd7ed728820eee497</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

They have a very professional approach to any owner of a high end watch like Rolex. I left my GMT for complete overhaul and it's pricey. BUT, trust that it will be like new when returned and warranty for 5 years is comforting. I have not serviced my GMT for 25 years. Until I get my watch back, I'll hold off on the fifth star.
Got my Rolex back, they get the fifth star! Excellent work!</Text>

Extremely satisfying  service!  1. Ship your watch. 2. Wait for estimate. 3 agree to estimate or decline(they ship back to you free). 4. Receive email a few weeks later watch is complete. 5. Pay for service(very affordable). 6. Receive watch in  2-3 days. IT LOOKS AND RUNS PERFECT.  I will definitely use there service again.  1999 Rolex Air King.</Text>

I sent a 1950's Rolex to them that several shops said simply, "they don't make parts and that can't be repaired". The watch buyers group is extremely professional and did everything exactly as they said they would. I even had a question about daily use several weeks after they repaired it. They responded within a day to answer my question.

I would trust them with any watch. Highly recommend!</Review>< username>

<Pics>None< /Pics><text>I had my Rolex Pepsi watch serviced about six months back.  Everything was great, including the price, which was way less than local vendors in Honolulu.  Recently the crown broke off in my hand.  It is a 20 year-old watch so I was not surprised.  I thought it was a simple fix so I callled locally for the repair.  I was quoted almost $1,000.  I was told another complete service was required.  I contacted the Watch Buyers Group and was quoted $180 plus shipping.  My watch is now repaired and being returned to me.  I completely trust TWBG and won’t waste time contacting local dealers should anything happen in the future.<//text>< gmapID>

I searched google many times over looking for the right place I would send my Rolex to not knowing if I would ever see it again.  Emails sent and off it went with a prepaid shipping label and after 2 weeks it is back on my wrist looking as if I just purchased a new Rolex.

My Rolex after 14 years of great performance stopped suddenly, I went online and found the Watch Buyers Group.. Their site was very helpful and I called for more details which was both professional and affordable.They did the rest, my watch was repaired and returned right on time as promised. It looks like brand new and keeps perfect time.  Without hesitation I will recommend this resource to family and friends.<//Text>

My Rolex GMT Master I had some issues and they kept me informed every step of the way as they did the assessment and determined what pieces would have to be replaced. Once it was completed, the watch was sent back promptly and i could track it as well. My Rolex has never looked better and it is keeping time like since 12 years ago when I bought it. Not to mention the 3 years of guarantee that TWBG offered!

<Text>For anyone looking for craftsmen watchmakers to repair their treasured timepieces look no further than The Watch Buyers Group in Pasadena CA. I just received my second watch serviced by TWBG and for the second time they have exceeded my expectations.
Both of my watches were inoperable when I sent them in. They needed parts, timing and refinishing. When I opened the packages upon return they looked as if I just bought them! Flawless. You will immediately see that trained craftsmen did this work..no question. I'm so pleased.
If I ever get to Pasadena I'm going to see how they do this live...

The details:
Shipping Process - 5 stars (be sure you read their detailed instructions) I shipped across the country.
Communication - 5 stars. Fast, clear, itemized communication on what needs to be done, how long it will take and how much it will cost.
Service Time - 5 stars (3 weeks in both cases). Months if I had serviced locally.
Results - 5 stars (see above). One year guarantee, certification and proper functionality instructions included. I learned some very important things here....
Recommending to all of my colleagues without reservation...</Text>< pictures>

<user_name>Loretta Fasack</user_name>< Review>
My name is Martin Fasack and I live in Long Island, NY.  I normally do not write feedback articles on a company’s service, but my excellent experience with “The Watch Buyers Group” in California made it worth the effort.  I own a 20 year old Rolex “Date Just”, which I had serviced in NYC as a result of it not working.   A few months later it stopped working again, and the watch spent several additional weeks in NYC for repair.  it was returned  in what I thought was a watch  in working order.  This summer, while watering the lawn I noticed the watch was filling up with water.  I refused to bring it back to NYC and decided to try The Watch Buyers Group for the repair. I was very skeptical about sending my watch to California from New York, especially adding to the fact of my poor experience with its repair in NYC.   I called them, they sent by email a shipping label with insurance, they confirmed receipt of my watch by email within two days, they issued a cost to repair invoice within two more days, and upon my approval repaired and returned the watch within two weeks from the time they received it.  My watch came back to me with a 3 year warranty, completely waterproof, and polished to brand new Rolex standards. I’ve had the watch now for several weeks and happy enough to send my wife’s Tiffany Rolex, which also had a botched repair (needs to be reset and wound every few days), over to The Watch Buyers Group.  I cannot emphasize the professionalism, speed, and quality of this repair organization and would recommend with my own 5 star rating for service.   .< /Review>

< Review>
I read the reviews and decided to take a chance on the Watch Buyers Group.This was the first time my Rolex GMT Master has ever been serviced by anyone other than Rolex. From the moment I sent the request for shipping documents until the watch was returned today, the experience could not have been better. I received and email when the watch arrived, another email a couple of days later after the watch was examined with a list of items that needed fixed and another list of optional items to restore my watch to new. Once we agreed on what I wanted repaired, the finished the repairs, cleaned and polished the watch and returned to me.

The price was reasonable and I must admit I forgot how the watch was supposed to work. The repairs were performed including replacing a couple of parts with Rolex OEM pieces. My 20 year old daily wearer watch is back in amazing condition. The appraisal was better than I expected.

They also were very friendly on the phone and something that is rare, called me back when they said they would. I was looking to replace my bracelet and the WBG scoured their sources to find me a band. What really surprised me was when I decided not to replace the band, they agreed that it was a wise choice at the time and finished the repairs.

They have a new customer for life. My Tag is headed there next.<//Review>

< review>
I must admit I was hesitant and nervous about shipping my watch to California for repair.   After speaking to the repair center via telephone and email correspondence I decided to go ahead and send the watch anyway.  My watch is a 2007 Rolex Submariner that I purchased new and this is the second time it's been in for repair and cleaning.  The first time I took to the jeweler where I purchased it and they sent it off to a Rolex certified repair center in Dallas, TX.  While I did receive the watch back in about four to six weeks time the watch was never the same as when I originally purchased it.  The watch was with the WBG for four months as indicated that it maybe on there web site and there were parts that had to be purchased  and replaced in addition to the polishing and cleaning but I must say the watch is now performing flawlessly.  I am extremely pleased with the service provided by the WBG and would not hesitate to use them again.<//review>

<review>I had been putting off getting my Rolex GMT Master 2 serviced for too long due to the inconvenience of being parted from it for the 2 to 6 months the Rolex Service Center takes to service a watch, as well as their excessive pricing for service. While searching the internet I stumbled across a review of a well known watch reviewer who had sent his Rolex to The Watch Buyers Group for service and was very pleased. I did my own research on the company, found the basic prices very competitive, loved the fact they used Rolex parts, serviced it identical to Rolex, and the most intriguing part to me was the two week time frame for service. I called and talked to Ben and that day I had a two day insured shipping label. I was emailed when the watch arrived and the following Monday I had a quote for service which only exceeded the basic price due to parts...I needed a mainspring and bezel insert both of which were original Rolex parts. I paid for the service through an easy online process and then had an email a week later stating the watch was completed and had been shipped back to me by two day insured shipping. I was without the watch for a little over two weeks. I could not be more pleased with how the watch turned out...it looks like it did the day I purchased it in 1992. I highly recommend The Watch Buyers Group for your high end watch service and you will not be disappointed.<//review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

My watch was taken by a family member and sold to this company. When I found out, I quickly called them and explained by plight, and they sent the family heirloom back to me immediately. This kind of honesty is so refreshing. Bravo!</text>

<name>Ira Fox<//name><Review>I CAN'T SAY ENOUGH ON HOW GREAT MY EXPERIENCE WAS WITH THE "WATCH BUYING GROUP."  From the very first contact to the final delivery of the watch I felt like I was their only customer.  I needed the watch in a hurry and they made it happen before my deadline.  I spoke to the owner several times. He spoke to me, gave me his cell number, and followed thru with his promise while he was on his family vacation. This was very impressive and I have told many the story that there is still  great customer service and honest businesses in the world. Personal service is rare these days with the internet etc. and having that service is valuable to any customer regardless of the industry. To sum it up I would give this company and the owner a 10 if available. THANKS FOR YOUR TIME...<//Review>< Response>

I worked with Ben and his communication with me throughout the servicing of my watches was fantastic. I had him service my datejust and also replace the bezel and cyclops on my crystal. Initially I wasn't 100% satisfied with the results of the new bezel but he asked me to send back and he ultimately made me totally satisfied. I also sent him my submariner and he calibrated it for me. Overall very happy with TWBG and would use them again and recommend them.</Review>

My trusty old Rolex suddenly wasn't so trusty any more. Years ago I took it to Rolex in NYC so I figured I'd do that again but I soon discovered the cost was ridiculous. I also checked with a major watch store in the New York area but they were also very expensive and were going to take quite some time. So I did the usual Googling around to see what my options were and discovered The Watch Buyers Group as a less expensive, but apparently capable and trustworthy alternative. Of course I was a little leery about sending a very expensive watch across the country but the reviews seemed good and I went for it.

I could not have been more pleased. Benjamin was communicative and responsive throughout the process, the repair was done relatively quickly (about three weeks) the watch looked great, and of course, it works! I highly recommend them and would certainly use them again if the need arose.< /review>

<Review>So much faster and less expensive than taking my Rolex to Tourneau. They kept me apprised at every step of the process. AND the service warranty is 3 years! Would definitely recommend.< /Review>< Date>

I've been so impressed by the WBG.  Whenever I've emailed or called they have been friendly, polite, and thorough in explaining what was happening with my Rolex, the entire process  took around 5 weeks but  the end result you are going to get like a brand new watch .. Kudos !!!<//review>

<Text>When you have a vintage Rolex that has faded in function due to wear and neglect, this is where you send it to recover its past glory. My 45 year old Datejust is as if new. The jewler I bought it from really didn't know how to repair it. Using cheap parts actually made it worse. TWBG was able to repair it and it's  flawless now. Although I'm not going to sell it, with it functioning perfectly, I'm sure the value has increased.< /Text><pics>None< /pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmapID>

<rating>5<//rating><name>David Young< /name><text>During the first quarter of 2016 I searched online for a quality source of Rolex repair and refurbishment. Having observed TWBG's advertisement and website I chose to send one of three owned Rolex watches to Ben at TWBG as a trial effort.  Call him and chat if you feel unsure.  It did take some degree of courage to box up a 45 year old "good friend" and UPS it across the country to an essentially unknown entity.  End result - excellent - watch runs perfectly again, looks showroom new, and has a three year warranty.  Subsequently, I sent two other Rolex watches of similar vintage for attention with equally excellent outcomes.  TWBG has my most sincere gratitude and unqualified recommendation.

I bought my Rolex GMT Master new in 1988.  Wore it 28+ years.  Recently quit winding & working, guessing the main spring broke.  Rolex wanted $800 to $1,000, plus any parts and sales tax locally to "refurb" it.  Checked out TWBG.  Great reviews. Great customer service reps.  They explained the process to a tee.  I shipped them my Rolex.  Got contacted in about a week.  Mine needed a main spring, 3 small internal parts.  Total quote was $832 out the door.  I said, "Fix It!"  Took them about 3 weeks and I got contacted it was ready, they shipped it back to me.  All I could say is, "Wow". It looked like new!  Almost every ding, scratch I caused in 28+ years was gone.  Crystal was polished, the case & bracelet all polished/brushed. Looked as good as it did when I bought it in 1988.  I followed the manual winding procedure and it's been running flawlessly for almost 2 weeks now.  Seems good to about 1 second a day.  Sweet! Comes back with a 5-year warranty too.  Two thumbs up and 5 stars to TWBG.  Couldn't be happier.  THANK YOU TWBG!!!  Randy Witham  "C-17A"</Text>

Found TWBG on a random internet search. Have to admit I was a little hesitant to be sending an expensive  watch with little or no knowledge about the company. However. my experience could not have been better. Ben and his staff were very professional, explained the entire process, and provided me with a detailed estimate prior to starting the job. We discussed all extra work that was done, and there were no surprises. Received my Rolex back on time and looking like it did when I purchased it many years ago.
I highly recommend TWBG to anyone looking to have their watch overhauled and refurbished.<//Text>

I can't speak, or even shout, highly enough about The Watch Buyers Group.

I've worn my SS Submariner Date 24/7 since I purchased it in November 1987, and its last service was ~ 20 years ago. It was "well used" and had developed a number of issues. TWBG did a FANTASTIC job...it looks new!  Not just to me, but two absolute strangers have asked me "when did you get your Rolex?".  Both were shocked when I said "1987", and commented that they thought it was brand new. That impression continued even after a closer examination.

TWBG was wonderful to deal with as well. They discussed my watch's problems with me before I sent it in. Once I did, they promptly examined it and provided their estimate, which included both the necessary work and options for replacing other parts. They also provided frank assessments regarding OEM versus Swiss-made generic parts. I made my choices, the work was done promptly, and they worked with me to handle my unusual requirements for shipping - all included in their free return shipping.

Best of all, my Sub works perfectly and is BEAUTIFUL. I couldn't be happier and if it were possible, I'd give them 6 stars.</Text>

Top quality pizza are served here. You can have just few slices of pizza if you want or you can order one complete pizza (which may be too much).Apart from Pizza,you will get interesting combination of ice cream here. But what I most liked here was root beer. It was just amazing. Very tasty root beer.<//Text>

The pizza was ok. The crust was a little bland, could use a little more flavor.

Price for the size of it, was good.

I received an indifferent service, no smile or interaction. But at least I didn't receive bad attitudes lol...<//review>

Place serves weak pizza. No flare, no strong flavor. Just premium price for sub standard pizza. $3 for water because u have limited choices... well that earns them 1 star which costs more then they made on the water.</Text>

pretty good pizza.. got it delivered and the delivery guy was very nice. I found it to be a bit expensive for pizza personally at 45$ for a pizza and bread sticks.<//Text>

Always pleased with their vegetarian pizza! Choose your own toppings. Add jalapeños if you’re a fellow fan of fire.</text>

<rating>1<//rating><Review>I've been going to Pizza Pete's since I was very young child.  Unfortunately, after last nights experience, I will NEVER go back again.  My husband and I were going on a New Years Eve cruse and decided to stop and grab a bite to eat prior to our departure.  I ordered the calamari and my husband ordered pizza.  My husbands pizza was very burnt so the owner gave us (free) ranch saying it would help and so was my calamari.  But because we were short on time, we decided to eat it anyway.  I tried the calamari and realized that it had gone bad.  I went back to the counter and the owner/manager was very sweet and apologized and asked if their was anything else I would like.  I ended up ordering two slices of pizza, but when I bit the first slice, I found a hair baked into the cheese.  I immediately went back to the counter.  This time, the owner didn't even come out.  She just told the girl to give me my money back.</Review><pics>None<//pics><Response>None</Response><gmap_id>0x80dce06c9e699359:0x66b6198801abf3ff</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I used to work at Pete's Pete's the recipe itself has been kept the same since the first opening of the restaurant but unfortunately a few years back an awful new owner started working there but now I guarantee you if you go back without exaggeration I can say there you will have the service of your life and the same pizza that you used to taste before because there we know that food needs time and perfection in order to taste good.</Text>

5 months ago i would say avoid this place but after meeting Jarrod Mills. I love this place now! 4 months ago i met with Aaron (Manager). I was going to sign up with the $100 enrollment fee and $20 monthly but he kept trying to push the 4 day training sessions on me even after i said no thanks im good like 4x in person (at least 7x over the phone). He asked why, i told him my wife and I are expecting a baby in 5 months....So i do my 7 day free trial, i only go 2 days because Aaron kept calling me during my work days and while i was at the gym still trying to get me to sign up. The last deal he gave me was $60 off the enrollment fee (i still said no). So to make this long story short everyone there is very pushy and are all about their numbers and sales. Now on January 18th my cousin takes me back to meet Jarrod Mills and this guy is easy to talk to not pushy and because of how he treats guests is the reason i signed up. I paid $100 enrollment fee and i also signed up with a trainer for $200 (Jarrod can help you pick a trainer that will work for you but if you need a trainer ask for Dom). Reason he got me to buy and sign up was due to the fact he didn't treat me like a sale. So if you are thinking about signing up and want a great experience ask for Jarrod. He will make you feel comfortable and can relate to anyone from fit to someone who is just getting started.<//Review>

This place is great. The staff, the people, and the equipment. It's just great and I love it. However it can do better with the cleaning. The other day I went to the locker rooms and I saw a ton of paper all over the sink. Besides that this place is great and it is worth paying an extra $10 over Planet Obesity.<//Review>

I like the pool area and the ab workout addition.  It is very cramped for an In Shape.  Gym is not cleaned properly. There are dust bunnies in all corners and staff do not keep the bathrooms properly cleaned. If the health inspector was to visit it would probably not pass inspection.I have seen staff walk around with a towel and clean every third mirror in the weight room with a dirty towel.....really?? Hours on the weekend need to be longer at least 10 p.m.<//Review>

I do have to agree with the free weights being all over the place and unorganized. It has to do with the fact the gym members do not care to put them back where they got them. Gym employees can only do so much.I have been a gym member  all over the country and in different area of California and to keep a gym organize it starts with gym memebers carrying and doing their part to keep they gym organize.<//review>< Pictures>

HERE are the positive and negative aspects of using the Porterville branch:
POSITIVE
1. The staff are always friendly, courteous and respectful
2. The steam room is CONTINUOUSLY cleaned by the housekeeping staff
3. The sauna is regularly cleaned by the housekeeping staff
4. The trainers are friendly, courteous and work especially well with handicapped patrons
5. There is never a fuss over how many clean towels one requests-use as many as you want
6. The instructors for special classes (yoga, etc.) are friendly, courteous, respectful and work
especially well with patrons who are fifty+

NEGATIVE
1. There is only ONE pool, and it frequently has the heating unit not working properly
2. There is only ONE whirlpool-and it frequently either looks grubby or is closed
for cleaning during PEAK HOURS OF USE, rather than during the wee hours of the
night and morning as one would expect
3. Dirty/wet towels left on the locker room floors and shower stalls are VERY common
4. All but ONE of the shower stalls lack proper, hand-held shower equipment
5. All but ONE of the shower stalls lack a bench to sit on for patrons who cannot stand
6. All but ONE of the shower stalls are so tiny that one cannot move about freely
7. Unlike the other branches, the Porterville branch totally lacks tvs in the locker rooms
8. Unlike the other branches, the Porterville branch totally lacks a leisure room for its patrons
to gather at/socialize

Currently, the most SERIOUS problem with the Porterville branch is that it is undergoing an extensive
(and leisurely!) RE-MODELING to bring it up to the standards of the other branches. Part of that re-modeling has resulted in all of the locker rooms/shower and toilet facilities being CLOSED to its patrons!

Needless to say, this is terribly UNHEALTHY-not to mention highly inconvenient-for all its patrons, but especially more so for those families with small children!! Rather than close the branch while it undergoes this extensive and prolonged period of re-modeling, allowing its contracted patrons a relief from their monthly dues during this period, it has unwisely chosen to remain OPEN, forcing its patrons to have to endure the discomfort of being sweaty/unclean after their workout! This problem is especially alarming for those patrons who continue to use the pool and the whirlpool, since use of either or both naturally constitutes a higher probability of coming into contact with bacteria...and no effective way to wash it off oneself EXCEPT for the use of the cold water hose present near the pool! Imagine how grossly uncomfortable it is trying to hose oneself off during the WINTER!

Even more alarming, with the current lack of toilet facilites, is the high probability that children using the pool are...ahem...using it in a manner it WAS NOT intended for (Kids:"Hey everyone! Let's PEE IN THE POOL!") and I will bet the farm that the ADULTS are doing the same!

Overall, considering all the plus and minus factors at work here, I currently give it ONE STAR because without access to toilets, showers and wash basins for it's patrons, it is basically UNFIT TO USE! Had this NOT been the current situation, I would have given the Porterville branch of In-Shape City a solid three-star rating.</text>

< Review>
This place has slowly started going down hill .
I’ve lived in Dixon for 15 years.When you pay a premium you want toppings on your pizza. I go to RT in Natomas instead because I work in Sacramento. Avoid this RT in Dixon....This place falls short .<//Review>

Worst pizza ever. Do yourself a favor and stay home. The place smelled greasy, super expensive, and the salad was wilted and brown. Gross! Never going back...<//review>

Great deals. Only bad thing is that there are no fitting rooms and no money back. Only store credit. However sale items are final and there is no sign stating this. This is apparently a new policy and I got burned for $3 when a shirt from Hype for my son was too small even though it said XL and they wouldn't exchange it. So I will never buy sale items without my kids present to try it on.<//review>

They have no blue school uniform pants at all.  The cashier was extremely rude, never said hello,  never even said how much,  she nest pointed at the screen with the dollar amount. The store is in disarray.<//Review>

This Factory 2-U has been in this location forever. I went looking for a grey tshirt my son needed for PE. I found one $3.99 compared to Target $6.99. This store good if you need basic items but my experience workers are not very friendly< /Text>

< review>
(Translated by Google) Bad experience today. In the store they had a shelf with beach towels and it said a special orange sign at 2.99. And in a corner below it said of regular price 5.99. When I brought a couple of these towels, the cashier told me that those towels were the same at a regular price. of towels and there were many towels marked the same. And well, if it bothers me that they don't respect the special they were promoting, that is, according to exactly the ones I chose, they weren't special.

(Original)
Mala experiencia hoy.En la tienda tenian una repisa con toallas de playa y decia un letrero anaranjado especial a 2.99. Y en una esquinita abajo decía de precio regular 5.99. Cuando lleve un par de estas toallas me dijo la cajera que esas toallas estaban igual a precio regular, le señale el letrero y me dijo que la gente movia la mercancia, pedi hablar con el gerente y dijo lo mismo.Me regrese a ver la repisa de toallas y habia muchas toallas marcadas igual. Y pues si me molesto que no respetan la especial que estaban promoviendo😔😧😡O sea que segun exactamente esas que escogí no estaban en especial.<//review>

<text>Food is great, the prices are good, although  the amount of food given has lower since the pandemic. They are up to standard by announcing 6 feet distance and wearing of mask. The wait time is approximately 10-15 min after ordering. Street parking available, don't park in Red zone because tickets are $150 parking enforcement in the area constantly.<//text><userid>116871943249161956604<//userid></record></dataset><record>

The shrimp tacos are what make this place awesome. It is awesome to start with, but the tacos give it the edge over most other places. Affordable and delicious. Every person I have brought here or shared the food with has wanted to come back and get more.<//Review>

Just left without ordering food. Quality of food does not match the price or the pretentious atmosphere they are attempting to create. Due to my office location this is the third time I have tried Houston's disappointed for the third time, I won't be back. There are much better quality restaurants so close no need to pay extra for a short inflexible menu and fake service.<//text>

This place is a place I like to call "yummy for my tummy", no matter what you're getting, especially if it's a traditional seafood dish, the flavor is always, delicious 💯🙏<//review>

I think this place is over hyped.  It's ok I give it a 4 out of 10.... have tried way better mariscos at other loncheras near by. But their shrimp tacos are good.<//text>

The shrimp tacos are what make this place awesome. It is awesome to start with, but the tacos give it the edge over most other places. Affordable and delicious. Every person I have brought here or shared the food with has wanted to come back and get more. You become part of this 4 Vientos cult after trying it once.

<review>Don't recommend it. The shrimp ceviche was good but the shrimp taco and octopus tostada were not worth it. It's more like a fast food and nothing like a food truck<//review>< Response>

<Text>Yummy, yummy, yummy! The food here is beyond fresh and the service very considerate and friendly. Wear your comfortable shoes and be prepared to wait. Since the food is so good there's always a long line. Due to COVID restrictions theres no indoor dining so patrons usually bring folding shares and eat with their families at their vans or cars parked near the restaurant. Always a friendly environment.<//Text>< username>

There are two shops where you can sit and eat and two food trucks.  It operates in the same place but the menus are slightly different so you can think about it.  Please note that it is delicious to buy in an outdoor food truck, and only cash is accepted.< /Text>< Pictures>

Shrimp tacos are the best here at cuatro vientos you can also eat different dishes like oysters, shrimp cocktail,campechana, shrimp and fish ceviche etc.. you can also visit their restaurant it's right next to the food truck, the only difference is that you have to pay taxes when you dine in, other than that service is excellent and staff is friendly.<//Text>

The Mariscos at this place are always fresh and prepared perfectly. Never had a complaint all the times I’ve visited this place. I got to try the New Tostada “La Poseida” It was delicious.<//text>

Very small place that offers delicious food and good service at amazing prices. Two locations are facing one another from across a street. If you love shrimp and fish this is your go to spot! Their fish tacos are monstrous and delicious.</text>

When you feel like having authentic seafood THISTLES  IS THE PLACE to go! Oh the hard shrimp tacos, the Campechana, the soft shrimp tacos! I’ve tried everything on their menu and never once have I been disappointed.. the service is not great but not so bad they’ve messed up my order a few times but, I guess the food is soooo damm good!! The sometimes bad service is worth the tasty and delicious food</text>

Simple & super good just how seafood is supposed to be. Very fast service and you have the option to dine in or order from their catering truck. It's a really chill place & the food is definitely authentic. If you're looking for a good mariscos spot i definitely recommend this place.<//Review>

MÉXICO 🇲🇽
Eat the World LA review:
East Olympic Blvd in Boyle Heights might currently be the epicenter of the Los Angeles taco truck power rankings, with all-stars like Tacos y Birria La Unica, Mariscos Jalisco and Los Originales Tacos Árabes de Puebla. But before Jonathan Gold sent Mariscos Jalisco shooting for the stars, the truck with the longest lines was probably going to be Mariscos 4 Vientos on any given day, and for good reason.

The original truck and bricks and mortar at 3000 E. Olympic Blvd have been going strong for over a decade, with recent expansions further east to the intersection of S. Lorena Street, where two additional locations have offered a similar popular menu.

With the sounds of tractor trailers and the smells of diesel fumes, it is almost a miracle this casual restaurant on the corner can be so comfortable and relaxing. A little later in the day, the spot tucked across the street on Lorena offers beers with your meal. Either way, sometimes you are just in the mood for a table and these locations serve that need better than the lonchera.< /review>

Tacos Dorados de Pescado were burned. Literally. Tostada de Ceviche de Marisco decent but price is not convenient. $4.50 per Tostada. I recommend the lunch truck before this one. Just arrive before 4:00 P.M. Food runs out quickly. I went on a Sunday. I don't know what are the open hours.</review>

Shrimp tacos are the bomb, the only sad part is that their stingy with their hot sauce. But besides that you can't go wrong with the fried shrimp tacos.</Review>

<Review>I live in Victorville California and I drive over 80 miles one way to this hidden gem in Boyle Heights California especially for the fried shirmp tacos $2.50 each,! that I highly recommend! You get half an avacado for every 3 tacos which I usually order 6. The mixed seafood tostada is super delicious but a little pricey @ $9.50. Another fair priced is the octopus shirmp cocktail. Expect long lines no matter what time you go but so worth the wait. It is cash only by the way. I highly recommend you bring your own drinks as their selection is limited.<//Review>< pictures>

<Text>Absolutely amazing shrimp tacos and tostadas!! Their aguachile tostadas are incredible with an unreal spice kick added to them. Easily some of the best Mexican seafood in Los Angeles.

I made a phone order to pick up and I still had to stand in line, a very long line, to pay and then they still made me wait for my order. The food was delicious... although I'm told that the restaurant food and the fast food truck that sits out front have different flavors. That is why many want to eat from the truck and not the restaurant. They should have a line for phone orders so that customers can just pay and pick up instead of standing in a long line with everyone else who didn't phone in. I like organization and cleanliness. The truck out side parks in an area that is not so clean. I'm not sure if the food is worth all that. The shrimp tacos are good from the truck but they need better organization.</Text>

Honestly I've only had their tacos de camaron, but they are so good!!! The wait for them is worth it. That is there is usually a long line. I always get them from the truck outside though.< /review>

Delicious tacos. Simple place. Simple menu: fish taco(2.25), shrimp taco (2.25) and lemonade (1.00). Surprisingly delicious. You have a bar of salsas to choose from, cabbage and crema. All assemble yourself. They hand you the tacos ordered.
Only thing I would change would be that the salsas weren't kept cold with ice when I got there. It was all melted.
Ask for limes and enjoy!
Plenty of seating outside.
Employees are pleasant and welcoming :)
Everything is done fresh, you can see them working in the back.< /Text>

<text>OUTSTANDING seafood place. Authentic and REALLY GOOD. They feature a Deep Fried Shrimp Taco that is OUT OF THIS WORLD!  I have had these tacos all over california and Mexico and these are some of the BEST I have ever had. Two locations across the street from one another, one serves alcohol and is crammed with Mariachis, the other is no alcohol but you can eat in relative peace. Highly recommended spot, they have a truck on the same street too!< /text><Response>None< /Response><date>1572721136092<//date>< Rating>

You know it's good when there's always people outside. If the restaurant takes too long to get a seat, their truck outside serves the same food.

$2 for crevice tostada and fish tostadas.

Fresh feels. So, so good.< /review>

If you're looking for really good mariscos on this part of the street, go here. I know you'll want to go to the other spot because Chrissy Tiegen and other celebs rave about it but seriously, don't listen to them. This place always tastes fresher and the flavor is just amazing. It's simple and it's done right. If you want to burn your mouth of, go for the red aguachile. The tacos are also really good!< /Review>

Two weeks ago I ordered 60 shrimp tacos for the crew at work and was impressed how quick they were ready, the tacos were such a hit the guys keep asking me, when are we going back. Tonight was the night, I went back and ordered 40 more and feed a different crew who expressed the same as above, If you like shrimp and sea food in general you will without a doubt LOVE this place. Very nice people and fast service. +5 stars.< /text>< Rating>

<Text>The spot is one of the best spot for mariscos. The fried shrimp tacos at the best I ever had and a must try when your here. The fish tacos are also real good but they are huge and one is more like two. I would take pictures of my food but I always get to exited to eat that I forget to take pictures. This corner spot also sells beer and the other locations don't. Don't forget to bring cash because it's CASH ONLY.<//Text>< GmapID>

<Review>It was really good. I had the shrimp quesadilla. The only thing is you have to use their ATM because it's only cash. They even have a truck outside but you still have to go grab cash from their ATM inside their restaurant. They charge $3. for using ATM. For three of us they made out 9 bucks</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

I love this restaurant! I came here 5 times and wasn't ever disappointed. My favorite dish is the Mantee and the Kafta Kebob. Good service and atmosphere too.< /Review>

<rating>4< /rating><username>Susan Dorsch<//username><review>This is a nice place with indoor and outdoor dining. I sat inside and fell in love with the velvet-like texture seats. We had tried pasta, Italian soda, cocktails, salumi plate, bass, etc. probably too much for 2 people but we wanna try them all. The beat service, right amount of attention. Valet is right at the back of the restaurant. Very comfy temperature and nice little not loud music, I will think of Mariscos 4 Vientos for my next meetings...<//review><userid>116571388608700159136< /userid><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmap_id>

This place has been my go to spot for sea food. The deep fried shrimp tacos are some of the best I've ever had. I also get the shrimp and octopus cocktail. Highly recommend this place to anyone looking for some good seafood.</review>

Food is good but this is the second time I find a soggy tortilla chip on my salsa. Make me think they don't throw out use salsa only reuse it.</Review>

This is my favorite spot to get ceviche and fried shrimp tacos.  If you are in Boyle heights then come hit this spot up.  I've never been inside the restaurant so I cant speak for it but I'm sure its fire just like the truck.  Also the staff is always really sweet, speedy and helpful.<//Text>

The best crispy shrimp tacos I've tasted. They give you avocados and a tomato salsa with your order. I usually take mine to go. They are a bit spicy. Make ares you get a drink if you are not use to eating spicy food. $2.50 a taco at their lunch truck (they have 3 locations on Olympic). They've been there for years!! Many have tried to compete but they are still the best.< /Text>

Limited parking.
No a/c in this location.
Serves water in a cup. Plus points.
Doesn't welcome your nose with the scent of fabuloso.
CASH only.
Servers are attentive and fast.
Love the many options of sauces on each table.
Order the fried shrimp tacos. Highly recommended.
You'll only find this this side of town. So far.</text>

<Text>The food is good. However the wait to get seated can take long. The place is nice it is located on the street called delatorre way and it gets busy there is no wonder why the food is great it is delicious and it is as some can say scrumptious but there is no doubt that it is worth a wait be sure to bring your appetite and you will walk away with a smile on your face don't forget to leave some room for the desserts.</Text><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

Their seafood is awesome they have great prices.  We go pretty much every Sunday, the bad is that it's a small restaurant and we have to wait anywhere from 30min to an hour. They have 2 restaurants on both corners, one has beer the other one doesn't. The long wait time is at the one that does have beer.</Text>

<Review>Decent food. But somewhat off putting customer service. We asked the waitress to split the bill between two people (we were on a double date and two of us were paying), and she refused stating it could not be done. How can it NOT BE DONE? LIKE, CaN YoU NoT MaTh?
Anyways, easy fix, we just did it ourselves before paying, course that cut their tip to nothing. Especially since they kept trying to rush us after eating, uhm, we hadn't even finished our beers. They are a part of their menu and they do not have a bar, so why the rush simply because we aren't eating?

Would I return? Nope. I'm sure other places serve better food and service.</Review><pics>None</pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

The food is good but it's not the best seafood place out here. I noticed that there was a fly on my plate when they served my food and it flew away when the waitress placed my food on the table. Also I heard the waitresses gossiping about the customers, that's very disrespectful considering customers tend to tip waitresses.< /review>

The food is good. However the wait to get seated can take long. The place is nice it is located on the street called delatorre way and it gets busy there is no wonder why the food is great it is delicious and it is as some can say scrumptious but there is no doubt that it is worth a wait be sure to bring your appetite and you will walk away with a smile on your face don't forget to leave some room for the desserts.</Text>

<text>Slow.  Slow. Slow. Almost 30 minutes after ordering are food was brought to the table.  It was during a week day, and they were not real busy.  If you need to eat and go back to work, or have a scheduled day you might consider .. other places.
The salsa was weak and watery..
The mojara frita. Had no seasoning.
We were served then we watched our waitress walk down the street, and turn the corner.  About 40 minutes later As we were finished she walked back.
When she walked by we had to ask for the check, several minutes she brought it.</text><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None</Resp><Gmap_id>0x80c2c8b107ba534f:0x26139bf0de9bcfec<//Gmap_id></record>

I'm not a fan of taco dorado's because to me theyre always somewhat dry, but omg... not with this place.  The taco was still nice and crunchy but the strip filling with delicious and moist. The avocado that comes on top adds a silky creamy bite and flavor. And to top it off, the salsa that's on top was delicious. I usually enjoy the more spicy salsas, but this one was more on the mild side and delicious. If you get a chance to go, do it! Just bring cash though, no cards.< /Review>

<review>The shrimp tacos with fried tortilla, avocado and salsa on top are awesome. I've ordered the fish ceviche about 3 times and it's always on the bland side. They also carry sangria soda which is a plus!< /review>< Rating>

Just left this place, and it is the best!!
The tacos dorados de camarón were good, aguachile was great and the filete al mojo de ajo was delicioso! Nos fuimos llenos y contentos! (We left happy and full!) The service was prompt and they were so nice. We loved it and definitely recommend!<//Text>

Best crispy shrimp tacos smothered in red salsa & topped with avocado. The agua chile tostadas are the best in the world there they put a layer of mayo then top it with all that shrimp & green spicy goodness.</Text>

Don’t waste your time and money. They served us bad shrimp, it was going bad. Don’t go there, we told staff and she got so mad and went to manager and among the staff they were making fun. They don’t have any customer service, good tastes bad. Don’t come here.< /Text>

So when I saw the building for mariscos 4 vientos, and that I had long time only been to the "stand" on Lorena, I knew I could get good food here and claro, I did.

I try the oysters, and the Taco Dorado Decameron,  and an Ensenada style fish taco. I discussed them a little further in the captions but suffice to say and not surprised that they were all they were all high quality, and the service was outstanding. Next time I go I'm going to get the tostadas.</text>< user>

Best crispy shrimp tacos smothered in red salsa & topped with avocado. The agua chile tostadas are the best in the world there they put a layer of mayo then top it with all that shrimp & green spicy goodness.</Review>

Omg another BOMB Mexican restaurant! I LOVE LA. I had the shrimp stuffed, deep fried crunchy tacos. Sooooo yummy. Also tried the  Aguacgiles Verdes - very fresh and lemony. Also the cheese flan! Excellent customer service. Cash only. They have an ATM inside. They take your order at your table, not at the counter!</Text>

Shrimp tacos (dorados) are the number one priority there. Cocktail os decent but can quickly be great once you add your own touches! Fish tacos. Are not the best but are really really loaded so it worth the money in that sense. Only 3 meals i get here and i dont visit often because I'm 1.5hrs away< /Review>

<text>One great mariscos place, flavor is how mexican seafood should taste. Theyre not into the "trendy mariscos" that every food truck wants to do (Wich is not bad). Theyre a cash only location so that's why I'm not rating 5 stars.</text>< user>

Good shrimp tacos.. Fast service but not reliable. Great atmosphere and friendly.
Only con is that they don't accept debit card, only cash.</review>

Food is probably one the best in East L.A. , the parking is ok some, but the Service and organization of the place SUCKS! They say 20-30 min wait but actually is an hour or more and the waitresses forget to bring the extra stuff you ask for</Text>

<text>First time customer. Had the coctel de camaron con pulpo (shrimp and octopus) honestly it was nothing special i have had better at other trucks. Also had a shrimp taco, which was good. Didn't try any of their other food so can't say if its good or not.</text></record></dataset><record>

<Rating>1< /Rating><Text>The food doesn't taste good at all ! Taste very bland ! The salsa for the chips is watered down , the tostada's de ceviche and mixtas need more flavor (salt,lime, oregano ) the shrimps and octopus was just boiled without salt. Ceviche had no lime . Very disappointed! What a waste of time and money! OUR FIST TINE THERE AND LAST!!!!</Text><pics>None</pics>< resp>

Fried shrimp taco! Yes I say Fried shrimp taco! Super delicious... shrimp quesadilla is also not your average quesadilla stuffed with flavor from the grilled shrimp with peppers and onion. My kids love kids menu anywhere from a delicious juicy burger to fried hotdogs to look like a octopus. Super cute kids loved it! You might think a burger from a seafood joint but you would be surprised. Even the size of the burger is impressive for a kids menu. Joyzdivision out!< /Text>

<Text>The only downside to this location is the wait period on the weekends. The food is delicious and the service is efficient. My review is for the location on Lorena and Olympic which is the one that does sell beer. The one across the street I'm sorry to say has atrocious customer service.< /Text>< Pictures>

<Rating>5<//Rating><text>The shrimp tacos ("Tacos de camarón") are super delicious! Every time I'm near the area or passing by, I make it a point to visit the taco truck. They also have a full restaurant right next to it and another just down the street. I always take people there that have never tried it and they are always impressed. Whenever I have guests from out of town, ai also take them there. The service is also amazingly fast!< /text><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< GmapID>

What are the odds of discovering two of the best shrimp tacos in town just within a block from each other? On the way to trying out Mariscos Jalisco, I stopped by Mariscos 4 Vientos first. I ordered two of their famous shrimp tacos. Much less foot traffic than their neignbor, Jalisco, and order came out instantly!! Just from the look of the tacos they were nothing impressive. When I took my first bite, my whole world changed. I experience that crunchy exterior and that chunky shrimp I can taste from each bite. After few bites, I realized that I was slurping the excess salsa straight from the plate. By far the best shrimp tacos I've ever had. I can say that I enjoyed more so than their next door neighbor Jalisco. I wanted to go for more but then I stopped myself for the next trip.</Text>

Food is amazing but the service really sucks, once they serve you they are done with you. They don't ask if you need anything and forget about getting another drink or water refill.<//review>

It wasn't all that for me. The salsa wasn't very hot, they ran out of chips, and the fish was not very tasty.
But man was there a lot of people. Maybe it was me.< /text>

<review>Stay away, I don't want this place to be any more crowded than it already is... If you do decide to go, make sure you get the shrimp tacos.  The ceviche is ok, but go straight for the good stuff. I heard the shrimp quesadilla very good as well, but I have yet to try it.</review><gmapID>0x80c2c8b107ba534f:0x26139bf0de9bcfec</gmapID></record>

<Text>this is a lunch truck that is always in this same location everyday the locals really like this spot you see this is a location that the lunch truck always serves and in the corner building they have tables where you can sit with your family, not a lot of people know about this place but even then this place gets full. theres always a very long line to eat here. their specialty tacos de camaron(shrimp tacos) they served oysters shrimp or/and octopus cocktails the food is delicious but when you order you have to be talk loud so they can hear you don't be shy that's just how it is, you'll really like this place if you like Mexican food. :-)

(Translated by Google) Taco taste never experienced before!
Fresh and reminiscent of taste!
Try fried tacos as a standard and try other tacos together! Fried cornnachos are additionally refilled!

(Translated by Google) Super recommended, there is always a line to order but they serve you quickly and always with kindness, I tried an aguachile toast, GREAT by the way and a large cocktail of octopus with shrimp also very delicious. One of the best in East L.A.

Super recomendados, siempre hay línea para poder ordenar pero te atienden rápido y siempre con amabilidad, probé una tostada de aguachile, BUENISIMA por cierto y un cóctel grande de pulpo con camarón también muy delicioso. De los mejores en East L.A.< /text>

<review>(Translated by Google) The tacos are very rich, the efficient and super friendly service, they are super rich how bad I don't understand why they sell the sauce if they are always busy in this business ,,, I don't think the owner is not giving enough to give sauce to the customers.

<Review>(Translated by Google) We have been going for about 6 years, we go like one to two kisses per month and we have no complaints, we like the food and the service is very good: it also depends on what time, because there are hours when I can't find a table and we have to wait and it doesn't matter how with more desire.
Ps is my opinion; in my tastes.
Thanks 4 winds👍. See you on Sunday, first God.

(Original)
Nosotros ya tenemos como 6años yendo vamos como una a dos beses por mes y no tenemos quejas nos gusta la comida y el servicio es muy bueno: también depende a qué hora, porque hay horas que no encuentro mesa y tenemos que esperar y no importa cómo con más ganas.
Ps es mi opinion; en mis gustos.
Gracias 4 vientos👍. Nos vemos el Domingo, primero Dios.< /Review><user_name>Josem Sanchez</user_name>< Date>

(Translated by Google) Before they served better, I understand that everything has risen from $$ but now they give less amount for more $$, for example the shrimp cocktail.

(Translated by Google) Order a toast of shrimp and a cocktail like Cameron, I expected something better, the toast with very few shrimp. The cocktail without flavor, what a disappointment nothing to do with the Old 4 winds that started. I will never come back again 😩😨😠

(Translated by Google) Great delicious food especially the shrimp tacos. Almost not wait even if the line is long they attend ppl quickly outside.

Delicious shrimp tacos !!! They attend fast in the lunch box, not chairs or tables alone inside the restaurant but wait a little longer.

<Text>(Translated by Google) Very tasty food really very few seafood places and this one has super delicious food. The only thing I did not like is that since it is an open place and in a corner there are two very large garbage containers from some place it is not seafood and with the wind very strong very unpleasant odors arrive that do not allow you to eat at ease I know you do not those in the restaurant have nothing to do with garbage cans but it would be good if the restaurant sleeps covered by windows or something like that so that the odors from the street do not reach.

(Original)
Muy rica comida de verdad muy pocos lugares de mariscos y este tiene una super deliciosa comida. Lo único que no me gustó es que como es un lugar abierto y en una esquina hay dos contenedores muy grandes de basura de algún local no es de los mariscos y con el viento llegan olores muy fuertes muy desagradables que no dejan comer agusto se que no tiene nada que ver los del restaurante con los botes de basura pero sería bueno que el restaurante duermas cubierto por ventanas o algo asi para que no lleguen los olores de la calle.</Text><pics>None<//pics><response>None</response><gmapID>0x80c2c8b107ba534f:0x26139bf0de9bcfec</gmapID></record>

<Review>(Translated by Google) Very bad service unfortunately for an element that you have bad in your group of waitresses can make the good that is the food ruin the bad service they give you must know how to select our employees to be able to give the client an excellent service had years in Go to this place and unfortunately today I had the most bad experience owners of this place I suggest you pay attention to what your employees do since what cost them so much work can be ruined :(

Muy mal servicio  desgraciadamente por un elemento que tengas mal en tu grupo de meseras puede hacer que  lo bueno que  es la comida lo arruine el mal servicio  que te dan  hay que saber seleccionar a nuestras empleadas para poder darle al cliente un excelente servicio tenía años en ir a este lugar y desgraciadamente hoy tuve la más mala  experiencia  dueños de este lugar les sugiero que pongan atención en lo que hacen sus empleadas ya que lo que les costó tanto trabajo se los pueden arruinar  :(</Review><GmapID>0x80c2c8b107ba534f:0x26139bf0de9bcfec< /GmapID><date>1494216193347</date><user_name>ma sisters<//user_name><Resp>None<//Resp>< userid>

(Translated by Google) The chips were hard, I told the waitress to change them, in front of us he put one in his mouth to prove it. If you like that good but that is not done in front of consumers.

Las chips estaban duras, le dije a la mesera para que Las cambiara, en frente de nosotro se metio uno el la boca para provarlo. Si le gusta que bueno pero eso no se hace en frente de los consumidores.<//Text>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) Very good food, the shrimp tacos are delightful, the only bad thing is a waitress I ignore, and we were calling him and he did not listen to us, that was the only bad thing, but from there everything very well

(Original)

<review>(Translated by Google) Today I went to eat and asked for water and they told me that I didn't eat water I will always eat and that never happened to me.
what is wrong is also that the waitresses are wrong at meals and are not organized.

(Original)
hoy fui a comer  y pedi agua y me dijeron que no avía agua siempre voy a comer y nunca me avía pasado eso.
también lo que esta mal es q las meseras se equivocan en las comidas y no son organizadas.< /review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None</Response>< Gmap_id>
