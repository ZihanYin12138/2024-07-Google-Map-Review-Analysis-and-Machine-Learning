Outstanding service. Took in my Honda for an A/C issue just before the labor day weekend. They were already swamped with cars that had A/C issues. Even though they close at 5pm and are closed on the weekend they stayed overtime to make sure my A/C worked before we got hit with the heat wave. They went above and beyond. Thank you Darlene (hope that's spelled right) and crew! You guys did an outstanding job and earned a returning customer.</review>

I'm very unhappy with their service, I took my car in running pretty good condition I asked for a tune-up and my car doesn't even run now. They did something to my car that they won't say anything as I'm standing there crying my eyes out to over all the things they have gone< /review>

<Text>These guys probably don't need another good review, but it certainly can't hurt! I've gone to them for a few different issues with my car, and they have been super helpful and extremely affordable, and always somehow able to fit me in. Cheaper oil change than the chain places. They care about their customers, and they 100% do not push their customers to write yelp/google reviews like some places do. I think this is my first google review of anything! Bohan's is awesome!<//Text><UserId.>105323044282332821551< /UserId.>< gmapID>

So I went to bohans on a Friday morning to have a blend door actuator replaced and my horn fixed . I left my vehical because  obviously they might not carry the part or they might have been busy that same day. i waited till tuesday morning for them to call me and nothing . so i called them if there was any info on the car they said yes it will be ready at 3 pm i got to bohans just so the cute lady at the front desk (i think her name is Darlene or something like that) could lie to me and say that my horn was working just fine . they where testing it and she hurd it honk must have been another car because once I got in my car the horn was still un-fixed and they didn't put the center console in place correctly just a side note actuator was like $69.99 labor was about $480.00 told me 2 actuators had to be replaced but ended up replacing only one ? Now to continue my hunt for a good mechanic :/< /review>

I come here if I need a quick oil change and nothing else. You can drive up and they will vacuum your car also. You get what you pay for, you won't be greeted with a smile and you can tell the oil isn't top quality, it will affect the performance of your vehicle. One time I went the drain plug was not tightened all the way and I leaked oil.< /review>

Absolutely love this place. Oil changes are Efficiently donw and within good time. They don't try to upsell you, but they do let you know if certain things need attention. Highly recommend. Oh and if you need mechanical repairs, they are very honest and thorough.< /Text>

<review>So professional and courteous. Trustworthy and fast service . I used to take my Corolla to the Toyota dealership for service , but I get a much better deal and friendly, fast service at Bohan's.

<Text>I went to Weaver Bros. Auto for about 10 years until they finally closed their doors, and they forwarded me to Bohan's. I used to go to Weaver's because it was like a family, and that's the great thing about Bohan's... they're a family!

Don't hesitate to come: the prices are great, the hours are convenient, but most importantly the service is top notch, because they care about people as their priority!< /Text></record>

A repair man took my car to go get breakfast at Holiday Burger (3 bacon breakfast burritos) and was stupid enough to leave the receipt by the water holder & not notice there's a dash cam in my car. They started working on my car at 8:12 am, "fixed the brakes," went to get breakfast at 10am (took half an hour) - "changed the oil" and by 11:00 am they were done with my car. I didn't get a call until 12:30pm. I don't mind paying to get my car fixed, but when you take a joy ride, use up my gas & betray my trust like that - I'm done. First & last time taking it there. I hope the owner reads this & if he wasn't aware, does something about it 'cause it just cost him two customers.< /Text>

They're a great place for oil and lube jobs and so-so as a mechanic shop. I've been using them for both services for years. They're competent and fairly priced at repair work, but they're not as competent with diagnosing problems. If they suggest work that you need I recommend getting a second opinion.<//text>

Unpretentious locals bar off the beaten path, and of free from tourists.  This little bar has heart, true dive, awesome food.  Fish tacos and wings are solid picks here. Best bar in Ocean Beach<//review>

Burgers are small and poor service if you are not a local. Owner is a jerk too. Spend your money at the other establishments in the area and get better food and a much larger tap solection.< /text>

But that served with french fries and your choice of ANY beer draft or bottle(19 on tap) or ANY cocktail for $10 and you\'re still complaining and leaving a review, tells us more about you. We literally have a neon sign that says "F@#K YELP".🤣🤣🤣'}</response>

Love the Dive Bar atmosphere that goes on at the tilted stick. A real gem hidden down in Ocean Beach if you get a chance make sure you stop by plenty of cold drinks cheap on the low low. Make sure to say hi to Big Dan he's always there and super friendly<//review>

<Review>Sad excuse for a browns backer bar... The bartender was amazing, but the bar is too small and won't turn on the game on the outside patio tvs. First backer bar I've ever been to that doesn't do anything special for the browns games.<//Review>< Gmap_id>

Our uber driver recommended this place when I mentioned I drink whisky. It's definitely not the typical beach bar but it was too nice and clean to really call it a dive bar. The bartender was not overly talkative but was on the ball with drinks, food, and cleaning. My drink was strong and the buffalo wings were delicious, and it was a BARGAIN. Great place.< /review>

I loved it here. This is a classic Dive Bar in the best sense of the term. The kind you don't really find too much in San Diego. Very reasonably priced drink specials and a no-nonsense attitude. If you know what I'm talking about then this place is for you. If you don't then leave it alone they don't want you there</text>

<rating>5< /rating><Text>Great local dive bar. And free pool! Can't beat that. Best chickens tenders in town hands down. Hand cut and panko breaded to order, I usually end up getting two orders (comes with fries).

Back patio can be a little smoky sometimes but the clients are awesome and so is the vibe. Some of my favorite bartenders are here as well.

Definitely a must if you you are visiting Ocean Beach and want something off of busy Newport Avenue.

I still can't figure out how they put such good food out of such a small kitchen.<//Text>< pics>

This place has the best wings in San Diego hands down. They have an unofficial lager that tastes aight but it's only 11 for a pitcher. Mondays the wings are  fifty cents each and there's free pool. The bar has an initial weird vibe but after a couple beers it grows on you. My favorite dive in SD. Definitely gonna miss it when we move.</Review>

GREAT SERVICE!  Food, not so much. I was excited to go there but the fries were over spiced and the sandwich was sketchy. I'm going to go back. I liked the atmosphere and I heard the burgers were awesome. So, another time.< /Review>

<text>"Tilted Stick Worldwide!"

Seeing Jonny's face light up when you say this, to get his attention, is so much fun to watch, feel, and leave with that experience.

I got the last fish tacos of the day and it certainly lived up to that best rule. I also got some teriyaki sauce on the side and the taste brought me straight back to all the memories of falling in love with the flavor over beer and juke box plays. It definitely makes me miss hanging out at The Stick. Yet, a good alternative with the current circumstances. Mucho Gracias! For staying open for carryout! I'm in love again!<//text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

My whisky neat was served just like I asked, poured into a cup. Free pool, which is probably tough on a weekend night. This is the kind of place you can go for a beer and burger without too much fuss.</Text>

Great hole in the wall bar, with great food choices. Come in for a beer, stay for the atmosphere, and grub. Totally ocean Beach attitude, and DGAF style. This spot is definitely a locals hangout.< /Text>

<review>10-5-18. Seriously watched the bartender verbally attack a lady. I was playing pool and it happened right next to me. I don’t leave bad reviews but this was borderline crazy!!! Please reach out if you’d like to hear the situation. As a business owner I’d would really like to know if this happened in my establishment.< /review><userid>114544343827566746186</userid>< GmapID>

<review>Local pub.  Free pool table in front, smoking area outback.  Bartenders are good people, kitchen is open till atleast 10, sometimes later to midnight.  Crowd is locals and regulars.  Bunch of TVs for watching the games or whatnot.  This is my go to watering hole.

That said, this is "a dive bar" for locals.<//review>< Pictures>

Good eats, solid drinks.  Great draft beer selection.  Food is served until 1. Free pool.  The stick is a good spot to start your night and end it as well.  The bartenders are always courteous.<//text>

I love this bar! The owners throw customer appreciation parties regularly with a raffle for beach cruisers. They care about their customers and have the best fish tacos in town.< /review>

Hands down the best Philly in San Diego and a solid, solid case for best wings in San Diego.  This is a great spot to watch a game, especially during NFL season.  They have a Bloody Bar where you can make your own Mary.  The patio was recently renovated some, so it's even better than before.  Make sure you read the rules on the wall so you know how to behave.</review>

Typical dive bar. Good for a game of pool and a smoking patio where you can hang out with drinks. Small scene, with a couple of selections for local beers and a plethora of the bottled domestic beer that you drink when you don't want the night to cost a lot.<//text>

Kind of divey, but a cool back section. It was Philly bar (still some good memorabilia) and guess what-- they make a very, very good cheese steak. Great place to go and celebrate a softball team win.</Text>

My beer glass was washed with an old sponge I could smell it on the rim , made the beer taste like the sour moldy sponge . If it weren't for that the service was great and beer selection is ok<//Review>

Because husband friends are hind the bar, and want to play pool, and the bartender want their friends to play, but not customers

(Translated by Google) This bar is perfect for Japanese who smoke. The pitcher is $ 10 and there are fried foods such as potato fries.

I loved this new Japanese restaurant! The ramen and broth was very tasty, and the rice dish excellent. I had the unagi don. We will need to come back and try the Karaage chicken! We just needed to wait 5 min for a table. It was full for being a new restaurant and that's a good sign. The service was gracious although they were not as attentive as one would want.<//Text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><review>First time ordering at this restaurant, we ordered pupusas Revueltas , queso and Chicharon con queso. It was worth the drive from Santa Monica to Downtown.

The pupusas were so delicious flavor and allot of cheese and meat inside not dry at all. Will be ordering my pupusas at this restaurant . Defenetly recommend plus friendly staff. Call head of time to order.<//review>< pics>

Whoa!! What a hidden gem. It's not too AR out of the way, but kind of in a neighborhood. WAY worth the half block out of the local city. The Papusa is was off the hook and super bomb. Go if you get the chance. Definitely a local spot but trust me they will take care of you if you go.< /Review>

<text>As a Salvadoran-American I grew up on Salvadoran food, I have to say that this is by far the best chicharon pupusas I've had outside my mom's house. On my first visit I order the pan en gallina (roughly translated; chicken on french bread) this was a masterpiece, had the Salvadoran vinegar veggie mix, avocado, slaw and the chicken cooked in a stew... I think it is a stew... its definately not a soup. The only downside of this "sandwich" was the soggyness of the bottom of the bread from adding too much stew over it. If you order this item, I recommend trying each item individually before eating it all together. Although delicious in my opinion. I also tested the pupusas, the chicharon checks out, but if you order it mixed with cheese, the cheese may overwhelm the taste of the chicharon. Of course cheese pupusas are always good.

P.s. before you receive your food, you recieve and cut up hand tossed fried tortilla with a refried bean dip.... this by so far is the closest item that I am accustomed too and fell in love with the memories and taste of the refried beans.< /text><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmap_id>

<Review>Very low stock, Very long delivery times if ordered. Very few electric recliners without rocking mechanism!! Other large furniture stores had electric recliners without rocking mechanisms in stock and good selection. Since the pandemic effected stocking levels, this may improve.<//Review><pics>None<//pics><UserId.>104406096250853145570<//UserId.>< Rate>

<Text>The Bakersfield La -Z -Boy Home Furniture Branch was once again terrific and extremely professional in assisting me to buy bedroom furniture. Mark, the sales consultant was very friendly and  knowledgeable. All the staff went out of their way to help me with this purchase.  Thanks, highly recommended</Text></record>

Paid aprox. 1500.00 for a sofa to find out 2 months later seams started coming loose in multiple places on the sofa. 4 months later still no repairs done to it. There warranty dept is absolutely trash. Beware people! Worst experience ever. I won't be going to Lazy Boy ever again. After they take your money there customer service goes out the door. Also the sofa i bought isn't nearly as comfortable as the model they show case in there show room.</text>

It also looks nice and not too frumpy. Service at the store was great. Nice delivery guys and no extra fee for delivery.<//Text>< pictures>

<text>When we bought our sofa we were told 8-12 weeks for delivery which seemed excessive, but we agreed.  We asked if it was because of COVID and they said No, that their factory was at full capacity.  6 weeks in we got an email saying it would be 16 weeks (4 Months).  Unacceptable</text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

<rate>5< /rate><text>5/29/20 UPDATE to review below.  Finally got our furniture (after delays due to the COVID-19 factory slow down - no fault of La-Z-Boy).  Does not disappoint.  Excellent quality and service.  Very professional staff.  Wish you all well in getting back to more regular business. We'll be continuing customers in the future.

Extremely professional with great products. The product lines go far beyond the old style Lazyboy recliners and reflect quality, contemporary furniture,  much of which can be customized. This is a company that transitioned well from old school to new. So now we are waiting for some new furniture that is on order, but based on recent past purchases we are confident it will be first rate. Thank you, Michael, for all your assistance and professionalism.<//text>< Pics>

<Review>Everyone in the store deserves a 5 star but the product is maybe a 2. The Kipling rocking recliner is the most uncomfortable chair that I have ever owned and at 76 I’ve owned plenty. It is no where like the one I sat in in the store.  If it wasn’t too expensive I would junk them and start over.< /Review><Rating>3< /Rating></record></dataset><record>
<Date>1565272787901</Date><Review>I purchased a sofa about 4 months ago, I absolutely love it. I am not usually a fan of green but this shade hit me the first time I saw it and knew it had to come to live at my house. It is very comfortable, I have dogs so I have a cover I keep on it to protect from their toenails and hair. It is heavy enough to not look cheap but I can easily move it to vacuum under it.< /Review>< resp>

<text>My husband and I enjoyed our first visit to the La-Z-Boy store recently. The store itself is beautifully laid out, with different areas staged so we could easily view the large selection offered and get ideas and inspiration as we went.

We were looking for two new chairs for our living room and would have been at a lose without Michael's help. It was really great to deal with someone who new the product and could answer all questions without hesitation. Everything was explained in detail, chairs and materials chosen, and paperwork completed with no undo stress for us (old folks) it was great!  We left the store feeling confident that we had been in good hands and have nothing to be concerned about.

Would we go back again? You bet!  Would we ask for Michael? YES!

We just bought a recliner from La Z Boy, Geddy Bailey (Store Manager) in Bakersfield waited on us. He helped us out with picking out the right recliner and the perfect covering! He actually put the material we wanted on the computer so we could see what it looked like on the chair. The purchase was fast and easy! If you ever have furniture needs go see Geddy at La Z Boy before you waste your time at the other stores!</Review>

<Text>I found my experience with the Bakersfield La-z-boy staff to be very pleasant. I originally bought two matching recliners but advised them that, once delivered, I may have to return one due to space. I did return one. The staff, particularly Connie, was understanding and made sure my refund was promptly made. I've only had the chair for a couple of weeks so it's a bit early to attest to its durability. However, it is attractive and comfortable and a nice addition to my home. Many thanks.< /Text></record>

Michael took his time to great us and explain to us all of the different options available for the chair we were looking for.  We enjoyed the fact the he did not try to pressure us into anything and that he gave us our freedom in the store to look at our options without feeling like we had a puppy trailing us.  We will be back.

<Review>We went here to find a couch and love seat for my 88 yr old mom. The salesman was AWESOME. He took his time to listen to her needs. He pointed her towards the area that fit her BEST. She bought a 3 cushion couch and a 2 cushion love seat in a crazy gold pattern she loved.
The furniture here is EXPENSIVE, BUT, it is built rock solid and will last for generations because they are Made in America. This isn't entry level IKEA stuff or even MOR furniture which cost almost as much but will not last as long.
P.S. No one has paid me to say this. I'm just sharing my personal experience. God Bless You.</Review>< Rating>

My boyfriend and I visited the Bakersfield location. Frank, the store associate showed us around the store. Gave us so much great information about the furniture. He was very friendly and made us feel comfortable. I will recommend Lazboy to my family and friends. More importantly I will have them ask for Frank.</Text>

<Review>I visited the store La-Z-Boy store in Bakersfield, CA today. Michael helped me for two hours. I appreciated his patience and his product knowledge. I placed an order for two pieces of custom furniture and he knew the different available leathers and colors etc etc. I appreciated that he was there to help me and was so nice about all of my questions.<//Review>< time>

We had a very good experience. Our salesman was the manager and was quite busy but attentive. We took some fabric samples home and came back and purchase two chairs. The whole experience was positive and we’re looking forward to receiving our chairs.</Review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

I have been trying to have my chair repaired for 6+weeks now and I can't get any help from the store. The problem starts at the bottom of the employee chain all the way to the store manager. The store manager will not afford you the respect of even returning a phone call. I recommend if you are shopping for furniture and you would like the store to honor its warranty with decent customer service do not shop at this store.</text>< pics>

<Text>Went inside the store and looked around for a few minutes, when a salesman approached me. I told him exactly what I was looking for and what I wasn’t looking for. Geddy led me to one chair and I added a couple more items I didn’t want. The next chair had ever thing on it that I wanted. I am looking forward to receiving my recliner on Wednesday.<//Text>< pictures>

<review>To call this residential complex a 'community' would be a perversion of the word. While the amenities and on site staff drew my family here, it quickly became clear that we were paying for the performance of care and not more than that. The facilities are not always functional (beyond previous pandemic closures, i.e broken washing machines) and response to issues is non existent.<//review></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Good apartment, good service, and the best management I've ever dealt with. All issues are resolved at the first request, issues are eliminated in the hours counted. The manager Gary is ready to come to the rescue at any time of the day and make our stay in the apartment comfortable and carefree.</Text>< Pictures>

Wonderful community with great amenities.  I enjoy the convenience of a 24 hour gym and large swimming pool.  The office staff is super helpful and friendly.  I loved that they had live music by the pool and the staff handing out icy otter pops on a hot day.</Text>

I've been here for two months and love living here.  We relocated from the East Coast and Tim made this process flawless.  We searched all over Alameda ,and this was the best price for value.  I wish parking was better, but we can deal with it.</Text>

I love Summer House! I have had such great experiences since living there. I had no idea that I could have someone work directly with me regarding working out ledger corrections and understanding ledgers. I love this and thank you Jennifer! You have always been so pleasant.< /Review>

< Review>
Nice, quiet, safe. My daughter can ride her bike through the walkways in complex. Gary is the best building manager ever. Super kind and always has maintenance take care of any problem asap and responds to you, in record time.
Maintenance is quick and works really hard. So impressed by all of them !<//Review>

<date>1622676527316<//date><rating>1<//rating><Review>The good:
Average $2400 for 2 bedroom during the pandemic

The bad:
Entire building is made out of inferior material meaning different apartment residents will get annoyed if your dogs and children start making noise and playing.
No parking at all. One permit is issued and since summer house is overly crowded and in an area with other apartments, you will have to park 6/7 blocks away :(
Many unregistered dogs in the apartment. So, in case dogs get involved in incidents like fights or bite, the apartment management will do nothing at all to find the owners of the dog.
Can't reach the admin staff at the numbers listed on google and reviews. Goes to voice mailbox which will be 100% full all of the time.
Mountains of trash and furniture piled up from Sunday evening to Monday mornings.
It's smoke free apt. You can smoke freely as you wish.

Finally, trying to get my deposit back.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

The worst administration that this venue can have, I have been waiting for 7 months for the deposit that I gave to be returned and to date they do not give me a reason. I call and call asking for the return of the deposit and they have a piece of their files and information, now it turns out that I owe a rent for December when my lease ended in October and I left the apartment in that month. I do not recommend this place to live.< /text>

<Rate>1</Rate><review>The renovated apartments are nice (not all are renovated, though) and Alameda is just lovely, but the property management company for this apartment complex is the worst I've dealt with in 10+ years of renting.

They weren't even friendly when we signed a lease over two years ago, but that's fine. One particular guy used to go out of his way to harass kids at the pool for doing nothing. But things got much worse with COVID, as they barricaded themselves in their office and refused to answer the phones or emails. The package locker room situation turned into complete mayhem and packages were going missing, but they insisted this was because "residents weren't picking up their package" rather than acknowledging they didn't have nearly enough lockers for a place so big (the same thing would happen during the holidays). I am very sympathetic to the fact that they needed to close the office and all amenities to keep everyone safe and of course agree with that decision, but they never so much as acknowledged that we had 1.5 years of not being able to access the pool and gym, and they made themselves completely unavailable the entire duration of the pandemic.

The worst was when we tried to move out. It took weeks to get them to acknowledge our move-out notice, with repeated calls and emails left unanswered. We had to resort to sliding the letter under the leasing office door several times before we were acknowledged. Now we've moved across the country and we have yet to hear about our security deposit, which is a lot of money, and of course they aren't answering our repeated calls or emails.<//review>< Pics>

The only person to answer my calls has been Deveaon, but that's not a bad thing! She was there to help every time I had a question or needed some assistance. She took the pain and struggle away from finding a new place to live. I love the geography and location of the apartments! It puts a smile on my face knowing that any worries that I might have immediately gets dissolved by the comfort of the front desk! If I lived a thousand lifetimes, I would choose to live at the summer houses every single day because of their helpful staff!</text>

Absolutely horrible experience with this place. It’s been over 8 months since we moved out and we still haven’t received our deposit or heard back from anyone. We called a number of times and they’ve just kept saying the check will be mailed to us in a couple of days. We still haven’t heard from them or received anything in the mail, but seeing some other reviews this seems to be a pretty standard way they scam people. Not to mention the place is a nightmare, always loud, dirty in all common areas, and everyone is allowed to smoke although the complex is “non-smoking”. Avoid this place at all costs, and Summer House we’ll see you in small claims court very soon.</text>

<Review>My car was towed unlawfully in violation of vehicle code section 22658. The notices that they said were posted were torn and shoddy and were not marked on all parking spots to which it applied. Our car was also towed outside of the stated time window. I had to pay $290 to get the car out even after serving a demand letter on the towing company for return of my car.

We weren’t the only victims of this. When we went to recover our car there were at least 6 other Summer House residents in line waiting to get their cars as well. Same story: cars towed without proper notice.

I was going let to be bygones be bygones. We just moved here and we’re still getting used to their brand of disrespect. But when my partner went to let them know about the issue they were rude as all hell and dismissive. If we don’t get refunded the towing fees we may have to chat about it on the record, in front of the Superior Court.

I knew I was onto something when I waived the arbitration clause in our lease agreement.

Welcome to Pop Copy.

Oops.

<Text>I have been living here for the past 2,5 years.
Unfortunately my experience is that they don't care about the residents living here, although when you come here first as a potential resident to rent an apartment, they will be very welcoming just to get you sign with them.
The only positive people working here are the maintenance team that is trying hard to solve any maintenance problems. But the people working at the leasing office are unresponsive, inattentive and will not respond to emails or phone calls for days or even at all!
I waited days to get response from Tim about my case, and then when I didn't get any response to my emails or phone calls, I had reach out to Andrea, but again she was neither helpful, neither considerate, and did not show care to resolve my issue.
What a disappointment it has been to receive no help from the leasing office when I needed one. And this has happened to me not only once but a couple of times already.
A note of suggestion for the management:
Care for the current residents the way you show care to the new potential residents touring the apartments. Make everyone inclusive and be fair, treat all people nice, after all kindness goes a long way!
This is what is lacking from this community.
And maybe this is why you are seeing so many people moving out of here because you don't respect your current residents.</Text>< date>

My little family has settled into our lovely new apartment here at Summer House. We want to give thanks to the staff that helped us, in what turned out to be a months long move in process due to the pandemic, and living hundreds of miles away. We appreciate Andrea, Devan, Tim, and the others that were patient with us along the way. They are always friendly, answered our calls or responded to emails in a timely manner, and have been tremendously helpful.

The apartment move in date was delayed because of renovations, but it was worth the wait. The community is very friendly, with a few drawbacks of having some overly noisy neighbors at night, but that's an issue anywhere. We haven't been here too long, but are enjoying it thus far. We are happy to call this home!<//Review>

I really enjoy living here. The staff and maintenance are always helpful with smiles on their face. Yesterday I called in with a maintenance issue and Kwesi quickly came to my rescue with a smile. If it wasn't for him, it would have been a long miserable day! My only complaint of these apartments is the parking. I am not going anywhere anytime soon!

The Summerhouse Apartments are a wonderful community to live in. When the pool is open it's my kids favorite part of living here. Since Covid it's been closed along with the built in BBQ pits and gym..... But once everything opens it will make it feel back to normal<//Review>

<review>The worst place I ever had they only care about the rent fee$$$ , I lived her for years paying $2500 and I forgot to put my parking tag and guess what got towed and payed $300
Parked at 7pm towed 2am reason not hung in the the permit.  No warning no notice even though my car is registered in the lease I called the office and they said that is the rule. You don't have any credentials with them.  DUMB RULE<//review>< GmapID>

Summer House location is awesome - it's far enough from the City but also has the residential feel to it.

If you’re somebody that likes to have everything well planned and a steady organized move in date then I don’t recommend Summerhouse, the leasing office really lack communication. They never answer a phone call, current tenents that live there and 1 lady that was moving out and where by the office have told me are you sure you want to move in here? (RED FLAG) but I wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt so I continued the Move in process with these people, and up until this last incident.  I’ve called them many times to try to figure out why my move in date was unknowingly pushed to a later date, I asked for the day off from work 2 weeks in advance And even scheduled a uhaul reservation, Only to receive the move in contract via email which stated move in date on the 27th without notifying me, The move in date I requested was today the 26th of March, the price changes throughout the month but on their site you can see what the monthly rates changes to if you choose a specific date and it said $2045 to move in on the 26th, the contract also stated and increased to $2,160/month.... (RED FLAG) so my fiancé went to the office yesterday and they told her that the reason the date was pushed Last minute was because there was a hole in the tub, and I was put on speaker phone and asked why didn’t they communicate that with me and the woman’s excuse was because “they just found out yesterday” but not true at all cuz I noticed the change of date like 3 days before and I was calling like 15 times a day and no answer (RED FLAG)if my fiancé had never went to the office we wouldn’t hear from them at all the lady’s excuse was because they are really busy dealing with 600 units..(RED FLAG)these people lack customer service i literally backed out of that place immediately, I know that it was only 1 day of difference but you have to communicate, because I organized a whole plan for this date. this place needs more and even possibly new employees who take the job seriously. The area is pretty nice good looking buildings, almost makes you want to ignore the terrible customer service that the leasing office has to offer. I only shared what really cut it for me which is only about 50% of my experience and the lady did not seem to care when I backed out (HUGE RED FLAG) considering there’s  a lot of vacant rooms on their site. good luck to anyone applying here!

<Rating>2<//Rating><review>Mislead with apartment amenities and lack of customer service with leasing staff. There’s no assigned parking and you’ll have a really hard time looking for parking. Dog feces are all over the property and sidewalks alongside the property. Roaches inside the apartment as well and they do nothing about these problems. I’ve only been here 1 month and my wall panel is falling off. Things were not properly done before I moved in. The only upside is the area is really quiet.</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

While having to deal with so many disappointing situations in the past I'm very compelled to leave a good great review for the positive experience I had when I had to call for a minor repair at the worst time during quarantine.  Flooding toilets is never a good thing and I was pleased with the timely manner and cleanliness of the maintenance technician Kwesi.....very polite and well mannered as well.<//review>

Great location for this property but customer service here sucks.  Service requests takes longer to get done.
Existing residents needs  and concerns are overlooked  And not addressed and always looking for ways to increase rent year after year with same existing amenities.

Calls are not returned and if the staff schedules a call appointment with you, they do not follow through and when you call, they tell you they were busy and forgot about it.

A few break ins have happened in the last couple years and complex is not doing anything to beef up security.

If you want a place with great customer service, follow through, customer retention programs, then THIS IS NOT YOUR PLACE.< /review>

With the stresses of a career and family move being what they are, Devann greeted my family and I with a warm smile and a professional attitude. We left confident and well satisfied with the options available to us and truly hope to work with her again in the future!

<Date>1611095833679</Date><Review>STAY AWAY. I’d give 0 stars if I could. The laundry machines constantly break down mid-cycle. We got one of the remodeled units which looked great, but turned out to be extremely poorly done. Cabinets fall off, permanent floorboard glue tracked all throughout the unit, the list goes on and on and on. And good luck getting anyone to fix stuff- it took 7 months of complaining for them to replace our screen door which was broken before we moved in. Worst of all, we keep getting turned down for other apartments we apply to because they can’t get a hold of the Summer House leasing office. Call the office phone, bang on the door, it won’t matter. No one is going to help you. Again, STAY AWAY.< /Review>< pics>

Toured this place with the Misses and loved it!! Staff was nice and the apartment we loved was a deal I couldn’t pass up. Unfortunately our move in date now is up in the air (due to my job relocation). But we’ll be back once that date is certain.</text>

My company is one of the vendors for Summer House and Alliance Residential. We have done quite a bit of work there and I have worked with the Regional Manager, Christina Gregory quite a bit. She has always been extremely helpful and friendly in our interactions and communications. This property has always been very well  maintained and Christina seems to have this site completely dialed in. Working with her and the staff there has always been a pleasure and I hope to continue our working relationship with Christina and her staff at this property.<//Review>

A few days ago I saw water coming out under my sink in the kitchen and I did not know where it came from until I decided to call maintenance, Rony arrived and quickly found the problem, it was the garbage disposal, he went to bring a new one and changed it

Affordable and the units are newly renovated. Kitchens definitely got a full makeover.

High speed internet is not available in this complex yet.

The leasing office made a turn around with new management and has made their office more available for tenants and applicants.

This place could really use some security or at least cameras.</Review>

The apartments are decent upon first look, but the cracks start to show. I haven't experienced any parking issues since I've used public transit and my motorcycle to get around.

Pros:
Modern kitchen
Good appliances
Well kept grounds
Fair pricing
Mostly quiet
Luxer lockers (like Amazon) for packages
Nice pool
Motorcycle parking

Cons:
Bedrooms have no built-in lighting
Problematic bathroom drains
Textured paint w/ some overpaint
Dirty hallways
Seeing at least a cockroach a day
Balcony screen door does not fit or slide properly
Caulking peeling and revealing older, rotten in places caulking.

Extremely frustrated. We moved out at the end of May and  almost 4 months later have yet to get our deposit and pet deposit back. My husband has been in contact with them but continues to get a run around. If something doesn't happen soon they are going to have a lawsuit on their hands.</Review>

5 ⭐️ for SummerHouse! I have been living at the community for a month now and have really enjoyed all my experiences. The staff has done really great through these crazy COVID-19 times and I appreciate all their efforts. The landscapers and housekeeping staff are always extremely kind when you bump into them. The windows in the living room are large and amazing! The updates are beautiful! And I absolutely love how I could use my credit card for laundry and not have to worry about carrying around quarters!! Also, I see a lot of parking issue comments - I have yet to experience those issues for myself. Keep up the great work SummerHouse! I’m looking forward to my continued residency at the community!< /Text>

< review>
Weed and cigarettes smokers even in laundry room and stairways, dirty hallways and elevators, vandalism graffiti on walls and doors, broken panels on stairways, bad sound insulation between floors and walls, and more!!! You pay the rent and still have to report about all of that to be fixed and cleaned. Poor management service ( Pinnacle Management in the past, now under a new management team by Allresco)

Update:
I was trying to reach you and speak with general manager or supervisors - it’s been a month, no response, you don’t return calls. Spoke with management and they were so “nice” promised to give me a call back. Left couple emails describing my issues - no one responded.
Horrible experience, even after living 6+ years here. Happy to move out finally</review>

Great leasing management team, good amenities, spacious community. Well managed. I have a little concern here and there about other residents in the community e.g. sometimes residrnts smoke weeds, keep building doors unlocked etc. Also my friend got his scooter stolen - don't know how much of a problem that is in the community.< /Text>

<review>I would not choose to live here as long as Summer House is in contract with PPI, a predatory towing company. They look for an excuse to tow anyone, and do not care if they are a resident or not. I refuse to support Summer House as long as they employ these predatory towers that actively work against the residents.</review>< Name>

<text>I can confidently and strongly say that there is an immense negligence with respect to elevators. Different buildings have elevator problems. Specifically speaking, 457 has a long standing elevator problem. The management told about 4-6 weeks of repairing time. Let me say, it is not working since May. Carrying heavily loads from shopping, I am afraid I will have a back problem. Also, washing machines broke down. The management says “it can take a little bit longer, use other buildings’ machines” complacently. In the case big troubles like this, the management is “comfortable” and senseless towards residents’ suffering. If we think financially and fairly, we have to charge and refund some money due to lack of contract promises. No elevator...Yet, if you pay the rent a day late, you are in trouble. You will be fined daily. It should be enjoyable in managerial perspective. The buildings are generally dirty. Last one, a big tray of food left over started in front of the stairs at least three days. I mean, I cannot neglect the positive things as well, yet these are due resident communities kindness and behaviors. When we first entered the apartment, there was a non-working fridge. When we left our shoes in front of the apartment, we get “warning” but when the elevator does not work, no problem for months. Let the poor resident suffer.< /text><user_name>Zehra Sarimeseli</user_name><user>106582149883538033238< /user></record></dataset><record>

This place is not a good place to rent. Management is terrible; they don't know how to communicate with their residents; they never follow up with your issues. For the price we were paying, we had our light turn off several times  because there were issues with their electrical systems. The after hour maintenance service didn't work because they are never there; if you have a problem with maintenance you have to wait the next morning to get it fixed since nobody is there after 6pm. After we moved out, they charged us for carpet cleaning, painting and cleaning even though we clean the place. Before we moved in, they promised us a $500 visa gift card that we never got.
I would definitely not recommend this place to anyone.< /Review>

I moved in to an apartment at summer house 2 weeks ago and so far I absolutely love it! The apartments are very nice and spacious, and the amenities are awesome! Deeba helped us through the application process and she was fabulous. She made our move in run very smoothly and was easy to reach whenever we had questions or needed help with something. I would definitely recommend summer house to anybody looking to move to Alameda.<//text>

Do you enjoy getting woken up at 5am every morning by various car alarms?  Do you enjoy getting woken up at 1am by loud, obnoxious neighbors, their kids, or their dogs yelling and screaming?  Do you enjoy coming home late from work to find parking unavailable due to non residents taking up extra spots, along with double parking everywhere?  Do you enjoy broken glass all over the parking lots where you have to walk every day?  Do you enjoy getting mean mugged by people brown bagging and chain smoking in the parking lot right next to your car (like come on, don’t you have a better place to do that?).  If you can check all these boxes, then I guess summer house apartments is the place for you!</Text>

Current resident for over 2 years, great people at the leasing office. ONLY ISSUE HERE AT SUMMER HOUSE is PARKING!!!

they dont have assigned parking space for tenants, they recently took away parking spaces and made it into emergency zone area.

On top of all of this issues they started to give out 24hr parking permits.

Just wanted to share this with future residents. "Specially if you work late like me" I hope they see this review and decide to take actions regarding this matter.< /review>

<Text>We were ready to sign a lease with Summer House but something just didn't feel right; the lack of clarity on the refund of a $200 holding deposit, the lack of email responses from management, and trouble communicating with them, the horrible reviews about these same issues on YELP and Google, and all the added fees ($100/month for a second parking space for example). We also searched the crime report through Trulia, and found there were a high number of reported auto thefts in January 2018. Not what I wanted to see when I'd be paying $100 extra a month for a parking spot that would be in an overflow lot.

We felt like the woman who was handling our application was not on the ball, very inexperienced and not able to give us straight answers. We asked for a full refund on our deposit, including background check since we requested this within 24hrs of putting down the deposit. After much back and fourth by the management, we were finally able to get our money back. When I went to the office to pick up our check, they had a sign on the leasing office that they were closed for a mtg, with the times of closure inaccurate. There were several tenants waiting outside, who told me that "this is how they always are." I am just glad we got our money back and will not be living there.

Please also be aware, the company only accepts Cashiers checks when applying and putting down any initial deposit. My banker found this strange, as a money order and cashiers check is the same from your bank. Only a cashiers check cost $10 to issue as opposed to $5 for a money order. I was told by the same woman doing our application that this is because a money order isn't traceable and a cashier's check is. Wells Fargo seems to think it's because they don't know what they're doing.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None<//resp><gmap_id>0x808f80df1c7d8be3:0x9029d8150390492<//gmap_id></record>

Since I moved to Summer House last year, I have been extremely satisfied with my decision. The complex is nice, quiet, and full of neighbors that are hard working people who go about their business.

Property management is courteous and extremely helpful whenever I have an inquiry and they are quick to update tenants on any upcoming changes through multiple avenues of correspondence. Honest to goodness high review to community manager Marcus Thomson and his staff for continuing to exhibit high quality professionalism.<//text>

I’ve lived here for almost a year, and will not be renewing my lease. Some of the reasons are as follows: constant smell of cigarette and marijuana smoke in the building hallways, that has also frequently seeped into my apartment. I’ve tried working with the management on this issue since I moved in, but nothing has changed. There are numerous distributive residents who make the quiet enjoyment of my apartment impossible. Parking is a huge concern here. If you come home late there is little or no parking, and the parking spots are so narrow that, after 10 months here, my car has numerous door ding dents and has even been intentionally keyed in the parking lot. I’ve had a water leak that has taken over three months to get rapiers, still not fixed. Locks on the exterior building doors and the doors themselves rarely work properly, which means the building is far from secure. On that same topic, the vehicle entrance gate has pretty much been broken the entire time I have lived here. This means anyone can just wander on the property, so it’s just a constant stream of non residents parking in the lot along with non residents coming on the property to engage in what appears to be criminal activity. They recently changed security companies, and since that change I haven’t seen a single security guard. Seems they went from ineffective security to none at all. Cars frequently speed and screech tires in the parking lots, making them unsafe for pedestrians. The last straw was coming home to find a vehicle had plowed through another security gate and was abandoned on the common area grass. I don’t feel safe in this complex and will be moving out when my lease is up. When I bring up concerns to management I just get a whole lot of corporate speak, so things get done slowly, if at all. They try and cut costs at every corner, obviously hiring the lowest bidders to do repairs. The recently had some sidewalks replaced, and their contractor didn’t even use rebar in the concrete forms, so they will buckle and crack again, but cheap is cheap. So if you’re looking for overpriced unsafe housing and the constant nuisance of smoke and noise, then this is the place for you. As for me, I’ll be moving away and not coming back.< /Text>

Despite all the reviews, I decided to take a look at Summer House after unsuccessful attempts in finding affordable rentals in surrounding neighborhoods. I had lived in Alameda before AND took a look at Summer House 3 years prior. Now, I'm a resident here. I have to say that the new management has changed this place for the better. Now that construction is complete, the grounds are gorgeous with water fountains all around, a gigantic swimming pool and beautiful plants and flowers.  The groundskeepers should be given full credit, as I see them outside everyday working on keeping the place clean and attractive (*reviews have been given about the trash and furniture around the dumpsters, which is accurate still, however, this is at the fault of the residents, not the property managers). The ordinary apartments are comparable to their going rates, so if you are looking for something plain to get you through the year, this is a great spot. They come with a double sink, dishwasher, electric stove, microwave, carpeted rooms, and easy cable hookup. So far we've had to call maintenance twice in the 3 months that we've been here. Though some appliances were not working properly when we moved in, the maintenance people were there on time and fixed our problems right away... no questions asked. Be careful for the "water fee" which is divided among the complex as a whole and attached to your monthly rent. There is ample parking but the car gates are not secure. Plenty of kids here who play in the complex when school is out. We live with a 10 year-old so he made friends right away. Last note, it can get a little noisy since the walls are pretty thin. I would suggest sticking with a top floor.<//Text>

<Text>I’ve been living at Summerhouse apartments for 4 years, place isn’t perfect but it has consistently improved. That said, the new property manager is incompetent beyond belief! This place has a lot of potential if they would get rid of him. Point in case:

The complex has been having problems with fake parking passes and non residents parking in the lots. New property managers solution? Set 5hrs of time for everyone to come in with their registration to reapply. Then he was “sick” the day after St. Patrick’s day so they had to rescheduled because apparently no one else is qualified to do this task. On the Saturday they rescheduled to it was a circus with no organization. He insists to meet with everyone one on one and do everything by himself, despite people waiting HOURS to reapply for something they are already paying for.

On top of that, when pepole complained about having to waste their Saturday he tried to guilt trip everyone saying he was “sacrificing his Saturday with his kids to help us” as if this wasn’t his job.

Bottom line, this place has a lot of potential, but I have major doubts with this guy at the lead.</Text>< pics>

The apartments are not the issue with this place. The management is the issue. They are terrible. They never answer the phone. They say they don't get our rent checks, after we have physically dropped them off to them, then they decide to apply late fees for rent that is not even late. Literally every month it is an issue with them and paying my rent. They take a week to even process rent checks. They come with these random fees when we pay everything on time. If you get notices on your door, investigate before you just give them more money they claim you owe. Again, apartments are not an issue, its the management and staff. Way too unorganized for me.< /Text>

< Review>
Summer house apartments are a great option if you're moving into the bay. When I moved into Alameda 2 years ago I found their prices to be competitive and even though they raised my rent it's still below market value. They're dog friendly, pretty responsive, and the units themselves are on the nicer side. Everyone in my building is pretty chill and I haven't heard about any noise problems.
Cons:
- Not everyone is good with their own dog and I've seen several incidents where on-leash dogs were being really aggressive with other dogs (not the apartment's fault but it's still something to be aware of).
- We've had a few minor annoyances with maintenance but we don't call them very often.
- Sometimes non-residents will get into the habit of letting themselves into the complex. Nothing dangerous though. Example: For a few weeks a guy would use a stick every day to let himself into one of the parking lot areas and just make calls all day in front of my building. I guess it wouldn't have been an issue if he wasn't glaring at all of the residents that walked by.< /Review>

<text>Previous to the new management I would have recommended Summer House. Now, I wouldn't even if it were half the price. You'll never see the same face twice in the management office since turnover is outrageous. Unfortunately, that means you won't see the person that promised to fix management's mistake and you'll have to go through the whole process again. For any little thing you'll have to visit at least 3 times before it gets corrected. They lose submitted paperwork like no one I've ever seen. The managers hide from the constant influx of dissatisfied tenants.</text>< pics>

This place is not worth it! There is very poor follow up from the current management with issues that need attention. Poor customer service! The police are here frequently. Garbage is dumped almost daily by the overflowing trash bins. There is trash often littered in the apartment hallways. The pool is closed or broken more times than I can count. Gym equipment is broken a lot of times. The pictures they post are deceiving. Of course the business office looks nice and the units with wood flooring (wood floors cost more). Get ready for door dings and scratches and parking issues galore!The laundry rooms flood with usage and machines are broken and go unfixed for long periods of time. The payment system is a nightmare. Their accounting is a nightmare. Honestly, shop around. You can find comparable prices and not go through the hassles that occur here. Once you get in...your complaints will go nowhere, hence why people try and speak up online. Don't do it!< /Text>

If I could give this place 0 stars, then I would. It is impossible to get anyone on the phone and when you do they promise to call you back the same day, but they never do. I have been trying to end my month to month lease and am not able to speak with anyone who can help me. I'm not available during office hours so I can't just drop in. I will definitely be reporting them to the BBB. Don't waste your time and money with this terrible place.</text>

<Pictures>None< /Pictures><Text>The worst apartment complex ever. The management is even worse. They play a lot of games. When you have an issue to talk to them, they listen to you first, go to the another room in the office, talk to each other, and come with a very different decision you would never expect. The best thing I did was moving out. They made me very mad, even though I am not living there any more, I strongly recommend you to think reconsider moving there. It is not worth it.

I lived in summer house apartments in 2010. It's very sad to hear that after FIVE YEARS they still have the same problems and nothing has changed. From these reviews it seems to have gotten worse. Hands down, this was the worst place I've ever lived! Inadequate parking, poorly maintained, thin walls, rude staff, selectively enforce rules, extra charges when you move out (...doesn't matter how well you clean it).

Honestly the biggest problem is lack of parking space. Second is maintenance. All the inside common areas are gross. Third redo the insulation in the walls or something. Then again... A better solution is just to tear the whole damn thing down.< /Text>

My roommates and I are renting a three bedroom apartment. Renting an apartment was new to us but we had a great leasing agent. Ms. Deeba Uddin was extremely helpful, polite, and patient with the application process and helping us get our apartment. She continues to assist us still after living here for a few weeks. I am confident that anybody who has Ms. Uddin as their leasing agent will be well taken care of.

We are enjoying living here at Summer House. The location is great with many places to shop and great restaurants within walking distance. Our neighbors are quite nice and we enjoy the amenities available here!<//Review>

Never returned my deposit! They are crooks over there. Do not rent there. I have a mind to stand outside there leasing door and show everyone what they did and do to their tenants. Took over 4,000 deposit from us after a clean move out. They blamed the old management. As if that even helps the situation or releases them from the responsiblity? They claimed they would figure it out. Never did. Called back few times. They let it ring off the hook-never answer. So they have a lawsuit coming. They will regret stealing I'll take away their licenses. So Unethical! Strongly advise anyone thinking about moving here to think again. Theres way better places that have ethics unlike this place. READ ALL THERE REVIEWS SIMILAR EXPERIENCES AND 1/2 STARS REALLY SAYS A LOT ABOUT WHO THEY ARE!!</Review>

Worst apartment complex my family and I have ever lived in. A bad experience because of a variety of issues, such as terrible maintenance, high rent and high fees, greedy over-valuation of the property's worth, high crime and nonexistent security, as well as the fact that they are slowly pricing out even families who make $100k/year. Summer House has made it too expensive to justify renting from them while also making it exceedingly difficult to move out due to rapid rent increases of as much as $200/month, huge penalties for breaking a lease early, etc. Avoid at all costs. Contact me personally for greater detail, if needed.<//review>

It is unfortunate they can still get people to rent here and pay the outrageous prices they charge, simply because they are in Alameda.
They continue to promote the good workers and managers out of here into other properties so nothing improves.
People screaming in the courtyards, trash everywhere, graffiti, and punks scoping out cars in the parking lot to break into.

When we moved in, fire alarms 3 times a week for the first month. No kidding, no exaggeration.

Called to let the office know the power was out in the kitchen, and my fridge and freezer were warming. They did nothing but string me along for 6hrs before telling me they were not going to fix it until the next day. The management determined it wasnt an emergency.
I am currently looking for a new apartment for when this lease ends.
*I would HIGHLY discourage you from renting here!*</Review>

As far as maintenance, I really had no problem with them! They are quick to respond to all my maintenance needs. Security on the other hand needs improvement. For such a big compound, I think they should increase staff at least 1-2 more security staff patrolling the area instead of 1. Entrance and exit gates should always be closed, not like this weekend, exit gate on Buena Vista Avenue was open the entire weekend. :)<//review>< pictures>

Staff are unprofessional as is this company, it takes months to have your deposit returned, dont expect any emails to be responded to and even if you can get through to leave a message they wont bother to call you back. Their are far superior options in Alameda ,I strongly discourage anyone from taking up residence here.<//review>

<Rating>3<//Rating><Text>I love everyone at the office... Especially Britnie. However... Ive only been here 2 months and the elevator has been down for 3 days now. They replaced the washers and dryers, but who installs 3 washers and only 2 dryers in a room? Now i have to play guard so security doesnt lock up my laundry that i started 3 hours ago because i had to get in line.

To be fair... I see improvements happening, but wow they are slow.  There are a lot of little things that they could definitely put more effort into improving faster... Gates, paging systems, treadmills, garbage all over the place, etc.  I pay way too much rent to have to deal with some of the crap that i do deal with.</Text>< Pics>

My name is Marcus Thomson and I am the Community Director here at Summer House. The feedback from our residents is very valuable and used to continue making changes that really give value to those that live here. Thank you for your kind words about the office staff and I will be sure to share them with the team.\n\nI see that you have some frustrations over the speed of progress on the projects around the community and I share those frustrations too. With all 16 buildings being painted, all of the elevators being remodeled, the laundry rooms getting a make over & the pool area getting a face lift, it certainly seems like there is always something being worked on. The rainy season brought us some much needed rain but it did create delays in our progress. Let me assure you that we are working hard to wrap up these major projects so our valued residents, like yourself, can enjoy them.\n\nWe will continue to improve areas of the community and I want to thank you again for your input. Knowing what our residents care about plays a great role into our plans for the future. If you ever have more feedback for us, please feel free to reach out to me.

DONT GIVE DEPOSIT-THEY WONT RETURN IT! They took over 4k deposit that I have receipt and proof of giving them the check and they withdrawed it & at end of lease- never returned the money after move out. Spotless moveout/no damage. They claim the previous managment have the money and they would take care of it. Well guess what? They never took are of it. Never called back. Never pick up my phone. DOESNT EVEN DESERVE 1 STAR. I'm sure there are many bad reviews to follow with this kind of management running or should I say RUNING the place.</Review>

The inside of the apartments are nice except for the heater that you have to shout over to hear each other. The problem is the unsafe complex. The "security" doors to all the apartment buildings never lock, so anyone can enter your building, plus people prop the perimeter gates open with sticks. If the complex would look at the bushes along the gate on Buena Vista they will see all the branches people break off to do this. I've talked to the office and they say there is nothing they can do, and the one security guard at night walks by people smoking weed, does nothing about the propped open doors, and spends more time on his cell phone than checking out the complex. Live here if you don't mind being in the ghetto of Alameda. There are plenty of other apartments that actually give you what you pay for.< /review>

I am not a resident, but a boyfriend of tenant. I have never seen a more unprofessional and unsafe complex in all of my life. The amount they are asking to rent  these apartments for, are not even close to the value you get. The 2 bedrooms should be 1300 not 2000. Grounds and amenities are unkept. Rodent issues are out of control. DO NOT RENT HERE..... Especially building 433.< /Text>

<rate>1< /rate><Review>This place is sad even with the new management. They charged me $50 bucks for a key to the apartments that i got made at Safeway down the street for $3.50. if you loose your key dont pay them just go make a new one in the machine 5 min away. i tried to return it and they gave me some sad story that they already ordered a new one and it cost so much money and they already cashed my check. This is a joke in one day you cant return the key with a receipt. On top of everything the guy in the front was very rude and talked down to me. The apartments are ok but this new  management is no better then the last. DON'T GET RAPED AND PAY $50 bucks! make a copy for much cheaper. Also they dont tell you this on the craigslist adds but you also pay for water and garbage broken down between all the units and that adds an extra $105 to you bill every month if you have 2 people living in the house.< /Review><pics>None<//pics><Response>None</Response>< Gmap_id>

It was a bad omen when I went to the bank for a cashier's check for rent and deposit, and the teller told me I should tear it up find a new place if I hadn't signed anything yet.  These have been my negative experiences in the one year I have lived here:

1. My roommate and I voiced concern over parking on the tour.  Our guide said, "The 3 bedroom apartments come with 2 spaces."  This is an outright lie. The excuse: "Oh, sorry, he is new here."

2. We were told the prices of the apartments are all reflected on the website.  We applied for our apartment based on website listing, and then the contract was for $200 more per month.  Their excuse was, "Sometimes there's a significant delay between the website updates and actual rent changes, especially during the summer when there are a lot of moves."

3. After signing a lease for $200 more than expected and one fewer parking space, a new blank lease appeared in our email  a month later asking for even more money.  They said there was an error, and we weren't being charged enough.  They didn't push it after we pointed out this was blatantly illegal, but they still act like they're doing us a huge favor and we're just trying to scheme them out of cash.

4. There is a significant amount of noise at night.  I was particularly peeved one night when a car with a custom engine and very loud after stock muffler was parked below my window at 1:30 AM just revving the engine over and over again.  Then the guy left the doors open on both sides and BLASTED his stereo.  I was going to call security, but when I looked again, I saw that it was the security guard.  I had to be at work 5 hours later.

5. Management is in cahoots with some local towing company, and they call them immediately if anything is amiss.  If you need to unload groceries because you don't have enough parking spots that come with the apartment, you're gambling if it will be there when you return, even if it's only 10 min.

6. People like to dig through the dumpster below my bedroom window on a daily basis, and they can be rather loud at times, too.

7. There are loud children everywhere.  Make sure your apartment isn't next to the parking lot or the playground.

8. You are next to 2 schools, which is convenient if you have kids, but a pain around 8AM and 3PM.

9. There's a creepy old guy in the complex across the street who just walks up and down the sidewalk and calls police for people who are parked illegally, even if you tell him you just need to run a bag of groceries upstairs before you hunt for parking elsewhere.

Basically, I should have listened to my bank teller.  I'm moving in a week, and I can't wait.<//Review>

Wish I could give some negative starts ....I lived there 5 years ago when I was a student , along with some others .I moved out early with notice and even got confirmation from leasing office, but unfortunately I did not kept it for my records not knowing this could happen. Later after 2 years I found out 5K charge was applied under collection in my credit history. I tried calling couple of times for copy of my relieving letter and got no response.Collection agency they work with are very rude and uneducated. Friends beCareful before leasing here and even if you did make sure to have documents with you at-least for 3years so you could fight back.< /Text>

I really liked living here. Here are the pros and cons:
Pros:
- Management office: People in the management office are very nice and helpful. I did not deal with all of them (they look very nice though), but I usually talk to Britnie, she is very very nice girl and very helpful. Always optimistic :)
- Price: Apartment price was very nice especially if u work in SF, though they require very good credit, and relatively high income to be able to live there
- Maintenance: They respond very quickly, usually less than 24 hours
- Facilities: Swimming pool, Gym, playground for kids, barbecue area
- Security: Place has gates and security guards at night.
- unit: has microwave and dishwasher
- Commute: bus station is 5 mins walk. 25 minutes Bus to SF, 5 mins to Oakland.

Cons:
- Washers are very good, but dryers were not that great. However, I knew that they will have pretty new washers/dryers on January 2016
- Sometimes, you hear people's footsteps above you, but its okay for me.
- Carpet in my apartment was not that new.<//text>

Starting out, we moved here bc we were in a time crunch moving from a different city. Upon moving in there were several issues with the gates, parking, different issues with our apartments and rude management. The management was since been switched within the past 6ish months and is 100% better. New paint, parking lot and dumpster improvements, new hardwood floor in our apartment to replace the old carpet. We called for a simple light bulb problem in our bathroom, and they brought an entire new light fixture that was definitely an upgrade to fix the problem. The staff now is completely amazing and very quick to fix and help in anyway they can. Only reason its not a 5 is because I come from a town where you get what you pay for and this being such an expensive complex with all the upgrades (which are beautiful), i would Just like to see more patio or outside space or newer play equipment for the kids.</text>

<Text>Attention Marcus Thomson  and  staff, not too comfortable paying rent online in October 2016. My husband and I had some worst past experiences going online  and do not want to have nightmares about it again. Read reviews about money grams, too and they are the worst of them all. Too many hackers and scammers on the internet and it isn't safe and secure to go online at all.  We don't trust it at all.  You and your staff will be held responsible if anything worst happen to our rent online in October 2016.

<Review>I went to take a tour of the facility tonight and had to give all kinds of information to even make an appointment with warnings about calling if I was going to miss it. I show up at the correct time, and everyone had left. After staring at me for a while, a maintenance man came over and asked what I was doing. I explained and he walked away. I followed him after a while and he said that he called Jeremiah and Cynthia with no response, they just decided to leave early and not call me, a potential tenant. I thought the place looked extra ghetto anyway and you could hear people screaming from the courtyard so it wasn't a huge loss. Just a huge waste of time. I'm not sure where they got the pictures on their broken website, it's much crappier in person.<//Review>< pictures>

terrible management, the corporation that runs it also owns the towing company that tows cars. It is extremely ghetto and they continuously take  advantage of their residents.</text>

<text>This place is highly disappointing. Tons of screaming unsupervised kids running around and almost run me over with there scooters.  The trash bins are constantly filthy with people moving out and abandoning furniture, beds, couches. The gate has not worked for months and so I am locked out on a daily basis until someone comes through. The grounds are pretty dirty, the halls reek of pot.

There are a lot of people who park in the parking lot during the weekend who are not residents and it fills up the lot, so no room for paying residents. They  need to enforce the parking rule more efficiently.

They are taking  advantage of the market right now. They are charging outrageouse  prices but are not providing the service nor quality they are charging for.

***I see that managment has responded to my review - the obnoxious loud noise is not just becuase of the Labor Day Holiday, it is a constant battle.</text><GmapID>0x808f80df1c7d8be3:0x9029d8150390492</GmapID><Time>1409770512929<//Time>< rate>

I have been lived here for last 3 years. Im just waing for a new place as soon as posible. but life keeps me busy on other things. I cannot wait to get out of here.
I live on third floor right next to the laundry room.
The apartment patrol guys need to check every building and make sure no one uses the laundry room after 10pm. Laundry room supposed to be locked after 10 pm. Apartment patrol guys have stopped checking on it for last 2years. every night everyone using laundry room in midnight. They dont care.  some teenager smoking marijuana in the laundry room I have called police many times.

I have called the leasing office to report this matter several times. unfortunately they are not even seemed concerning this issue. Once my neighbor arrested right in front of my hall way. No explanination or anything.

Just don't live here.</text>

Please!!!Please!!!Please!!!

I beg you to please add your comments about Summer House Apartment Homes to
the BBB® - Better Business Bureau website. It's great that the information is posted here for all to see, but FPI Management is the Management company that is managing this complex. FPI Management has an A+ rating on the BBB site and that must change. Summer House Apartments has an F rating and the management company should have one also. Please help changing FPI Managements rating to an F rating
as there service and management practices deserves.<//Review>

What building to you reside in? I'd love to look into this for you. Also, you may be pleased to hear that we have already begun to remodel our interior hallways.

This store is so wonderful! The owner is personable and I’ve had wonderful and enriching conversations whenever I visit. I work in the Field of metaphysics, meditation and sound healing and I get a lot of my supplies there since I like to shop at smaller stores!</Text>

I love to stroll this shop.  It is my favorite.  Have bought so many treasures here & I love talking with the staff who are happy to answer my many questions.  If I go to Idyllwild, it's for lunch & this shop, alone, most times.</Text>

Winter hours and summer hours differ. They close a little earlier in the winter months. A magical place with great energy. Recently expanded showroom really looks nice!  The road to Idyllwild is open on the weekends now! Great! Idyllwild is a great place and this store has great prices and nice, knowledgeable staff.</text>

DON'T ORDER HERE EVER!!! Worst customer service ever. Thought ordering online was the best way to order, boy was I wrong. Maybe, just maybe they should do the orders in the order they arrive. Nah, that's silly.< /review>

The girl on the phone did not want to take our order on phone, asked if we can come in,  she said they are closing early,  I asked why she said "because" when I requested her manager's name she said they aren't there, I still insisted on the manager's name and she refused to give it to me multiple times. Probably because she did not want to be busted for closing early. And was very rude. Smh.

<text>When placing my order the cashier wasnt very friendly and had bad attitudes as if they were annoyed by me and my friends presence. I wouldn't visit here again nor would I recommend to anyone else. The customer service was terrible and the food wasn't great at all.<//text>< Pictures>

I love Papa Murphy's!! The prices are already reasonable...but take advantage of the discount coupons (via mail and online) to save even more money!</review>

This is by far the worst place I’ve ever been to! They need to retrain on customer service and relations! They have a rude cashier that chews gum while talking and her whole demeanor is bad. No greeting, no thank you. Btw, she was on her phone when I got there and I had to wait for her to take my order!< /text>

This place is the best Papa Murphy's I've been to. They always make my pizza correctly. They actually measure the toppings and the pizzas to Papa Murphy's standards. They don't just eyeball is and guess. I appericate that and they take their time to make each pizza correctly. Great job team at this store!!!!< /review>

<review>Extremely expensive, yet what can you expect from a big-business mechanic.

They're trustworthy,, and they do the job. You can even talk to the mechanic one-on-one if need be.

Their scheduling is great.

The place is always organized.

But man, is it expensive. Call around some other places and you'll see what I mean.<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1609610670952, 'text': 'Thank you for the positive rating Keenan.

I had a tire of irregular size. The guys were patient and able to figure out how to get the tire and brad to air up correctly.  I will totally return for service in the future!< /text>

<Rating>2</Rating><text>This is a new one lol...so I get there and I ask them to do a full vehicle inspection, she tells me it’s gonna be a 1.5-2 hour wait, which is fine since I had no appointment and there was only one mechanic in for the day because the other called in sick. I sit there for about an hour, maybe an hour and a half, just for her to tell me that the mechanic in actually doesn’t know how to do a full vehicle inspection...like WHAT?! Why make me wait that long just to tell me that, why not tell me as soon as I got there? That was the biggest waste of time I’ve ever been through. Sat there for absolutely nothing. It was my first time here and I definitely will not ever be back just cause of that. What kind of mechanic doesn’t know how to do a full inspection anyway? I’m giving two stars because the lady was actually nice even though she wasted my time lol.<//text>< Pictures>

Needed a battery for my car...researched website for options and found a price I could live with.  Called and spoke with a representative and was quoted an amount over $100 more for the same battery.  Asked for a ballpark quote on certain services and informed no quotes over the phone...nevermind!</review>

I had to change tires on my BMW last year at Pep boys San Marcos, they charged me about 320 per tire, (now I know Michelin at Costco with 60K warranty is about $200) after about a year I had a leaking tire and went to costco where they told me tires are worn out too much (under 2 mm).I went to couple of Pep boys, they had no record, I went back to the same shop in San Marcos and they tried to say no record but I had receipt copies then they tried to say "there are no warranties on these tires or no mileage recorded despite they had told me these tires have 30000 miles warranty  while they are worn out after 7000 miles, so I have no choice other than taking these criminals to court.</Text>

Once there, the service was super fast, the staff members were professional, and the price was a fraction of what I've been paying somewhere else (plus, you get a discount of your a rewards member which is fast and free to sign up in store or online). I will be returning here from now on, highly recommended for quality service at affordable prices!</Review>< pictures>

Pat the service manager at this location is awesome.  We've been doing business there before it was purchased by Pep Boys and Pat has been there all along taking great care of us.  Always a pleasure and always works to get us taken care of in a quick and efficient manner. He and the technicians there are a great team and do great work.<//text>

Hi! Pep Boys is awesome! My mom and I both went there to get our brakes fixed on different occasions. They were informative, courteous, and very reasonable. There was no pressure from them and they encouraged us to look at other prices and we did! They are by far the best deal in town and great service!<//Review>

After the oil change was done i noticed they had the wrong mileage on my paperwork. (123k). I had them change the paperwork and left it at that. Until today, my car holds 5 qts of oil. My light just came on today,  telling me to change the oil. I check it and there’s no oil on my dipstick. Take it to a different mechanic, they let me watch them drain the oil, the oil was dirty, and there was only 2.5 qts of oil. I don’t think my oil was even changed here. 🤷🏻‍♀️ I only drove 2,500 miles since the oil change.<//review>< response>

They try to up-sell you overpriced services and then offer you "deals" (at the actual price) if you refuse them.
I took my car in for a diagnosis of a strange noise and a brake job. They misdiagnosed the noise as the Rack and Pinion and estimated it at $1000+ to repair. I took it to a small-town trusted mechanic and they found that there was a leak in the brake fluid pump. I told them to fix it and guess what, the noise was gone! And at less than half the price! If I went with PepBoys, I would be $1000+ in the hole AND not have my problem fixed.
Also, the breaks were squeaking really bad after they changed them and I had them re-done at the small-town trusted mechanic and guess what, they don't squeak anymore!
To be fair, I've been at the Oceanside Pep Boys and had good experiences, but something is up at this location. Don't do it, find a trusted mechanic, even if it is a bit more expensive.</review>

<name>From The Aether<//name><Date>1556061775879</Date><rate>1<//rate><text>Those guys need someone who knows how to be a little more hospitable plus more mechanics. Getting real tired of being talked down to like I know nothing and then walking around the area all damn day waiting for a simple procedure to get done. And then, on top of that, not have it complete.

I wrote everything that I needed done nice and neat in an email explaining what I need which was to get my lights fixed, oil change and new tires and if no tires today then at least pull the nail that's in the one tire.

Simple enough right? I made an appointment 3 days before for first thing in the morning and then when I got there at 9am, the guy responsible for being behind the desk wasn't even there. No one else is around except the guy who mans the store.

Well after 10 minutes, I ask the guy at the store if he could help me and he rang the guy who's in charge of the mechanics bay.

When he came, he seemed disgruntled with a paper in his hand that had my email on it. Mind you, it was only about a paragraph but being that he had to read all that...which I know for a fact he didn't, he wanted to act like he was almighty and that my requests were ridiculous.

About the tires...I was told that I don't need them now so call them later. Ok. We go walk around half the day, went to the diner, went for a hike at calaveras and came back and they still weren't done.

I was literally staring at the guy with my truck in the garage, eating, smoking and not doing anything while no one else was even in there. Making the work last all day and inconviencing me and pushing the price tag up. Not fair.

If that's the motto at Pepoys,

'Make the work last and keep em coming back' then I'm not buying.

BTW, all the one guy managed to do was the oil change and pull the nail after having to say I have to get going after at least 4 hours of waiting at around 2pm that same day.

I called ahead there once needing new tires after the initial waiting-all day-for-service that wasn't even complete. They didnt fix my head light, it was out and I replaced the bulb and nothing. Just needed the part it plugs into.

Anyway, I had it taken somewhere else just to fix that problem with the light and I will NEVER NEVER EVER GO TO A PEPBOYS EVER AGAIN because its seems to be the general attitude at almost everyone I go to and I have been across the country.

'Eff the customer as long as I still get paid, make it last all day.'

The guy had a rude comment saying I look like a terrorist just cause I had a bandana on so maybe that's why I did not recieve good service. I don't know, whatever but I do know I will NOT be putting my beloved vehicle in a pepboys garage ever again and I hope you will at least think twice before going there or only go there for ONE stupid thing. MAYBE those guys could handle that.

They really need to get some new people in there that are more aware and accommodating. If corporate cares at all, they will go and have a visit and soon fire those guys that haven't learned a thing about serving in all the years they have been here.<//text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

They were played to fix the rear main seal and ended up breaking the car worse. When contacting corporate they refused to pay for repair or give refund. Dont ever take your car here, they talk the talk but are really dishonest and unskilled.</Review>

< review>
I drive for Uber and Lyft part time and needed to get an annual inspection done. I called Pep Boys in San Marcos to see if I needed to schedule an appointment and was greeted by Robert on the phone. He was pleasant and told me to come on in whenever and it shouldn't take it too long.

I drove over and was surprised there was no line whatsoever so it turned out great. I was greeted first by Robert, the same person that had assisted me over the phone. He said that he could do the inspection now and it would take about 15 minutes to complete and he'd fill out both forms for Uber and Lyft. I waited in the waiting area which had a Keurig machine for free coffee which was nice. About 10 minutes later, he was all done and I paid and was on my way.

I would definitely visit this Pep Boys again. Super simple, straight forward, no wait, friendly, fast, and helpful. Also, this location doesn't have the same layout as a regular Pep Boys. No car parts. Mostly service and tires it seems. Almost has a small business type feel.< /review>

<text>In n out is one of my fave fast food burgers, however, I always go to the one in Pleasanton. It was only until yesterday I went to this one and I sadly experienced not one, but two strands of long hair in my burger! I was really hungry last night and I wasn’t able to enjoy my dinner because of this. So please be careful in the back. The fries weren’t that bad tho.</text>< Rating>

Consistently serving cheap and fresh tasting hamburgers. Some of my favorite french fries, which can be made even better by adding melted cheese or having them made "Animal Style". A wonderful selection of soft drinks and classic tasting milkshakes, In-N-Out makes shame of the old fashioned rule that things cant be quick, cheap, and good tasting all at the same time. For Californians and people who have frequented the West Coast, this should feel nostalgic. For anyone who hasn't had the chance to taste it, In-N-Out will undoubtedly remain the one of the highlights of their trip to the Bay Area.<//review>

We waited over 20 minutes for our order, even though the line at the cashier wasn't long before us, just one or two customers.

When we got our food, it was already cool and not hot at all.

They didn't offer ketchup and were very slow to refill our drinks.

Food itself was normal, hence the 3 stars.

Overall a subpar In-N-Out experience. We'll try to avoid it next time we're in the area.< /Text>

This is definitely one of the better in-n-out out there!! Compared to other locations I’ve been to, the burgers here are all fresh and supppper delicious! The fries were not too dry and the burgers were pretty juicy. Everything about this location was fantastic! I bet you’ll also enjoy eating here as well.

They’re also hiring right now. Starting from $17.00 to $19.50<//Review>

The drive through line at this location is run in an orderly fashion with plenty of room - I have a 22 ft long truck and this is important</text>

Some of the best service I've ever seen. The way they work and treat customers is superior to other places. Food is very good as well; love the burgers!. Simple, yet tasty. But the 5 stars was mainly for the people! As they were amazing!< /Text>

<Review>A tremendous nightmare starting with the parking and lack of empathy for covid-19. This particular location does not care about covid-19 cases or if you get sick or not. With a rush to open their doors so quickly, it's no wonder people are flocking to this place like the plague. I've seen people go in (only once & final time) without a mask and come out coughing and panting. If that's the case, they might as well let the whole city of Tracy in and avoid the rules altogether, making it impossible for you to get into the hospital if you need to. Although they have signs on the doors, people are still being let in maskless, crowded lines and less cleaning. The parking lot intrudes on the smaller businesses around it, meaning you can't park anywhere to get to those small shops, you have to park across the street. It was also closed briefly during the pandemic to sanitize the entire store in which didn't help but only for a few days. But like all places, if someone has tested positive for covid-19, that person may or may not wish to disclose that information with the company, in great fear of losing their job. Not much they can do about it, but if you're worried about contracting the virus, you may want to opt out of fast food for awhile and this place is no exception. The lines are ridiculously long and the customers are impatient, rude and negligent. Good luck waiting an hour in the drive thru. No thanks.< /Review><gmapID>0x808fe7ace7d15f17:0xe6db0a27818c9505<//gmapID><Pics>None</Pics><rating>1</rating>< user_id>

<text>The fries here are different and delicious. The employees were friendly, cheerful, and looked like they enjoy working here. I ordered a hamburger with nothing on it except extra pickles and they put just the right amount of pickles. The place was very busy with an almost full parking lot and a long drive thru line but we did not have to wait long for our food. Even in such a busy time, the restaurant was clean.<//text></record></dataset><record>

I honestly can't tell what the hype if all about. Yes, the service is great, everyone smiles, the food comes out on time and overall it's just a solid experience. But, the food is just average fast food type. I prefer shake shack and five guys over this in-n-out burger and the fries were disappointing. I like crispy fries and these were not that. A decent late night snack option, but I wouldn't go out of my way.< /Text>

Today I was in Livermore CA visiting a relative. One of the first things I did was Google In-N-Out Burger. Nothing compares to it! It's in a class of its own from the personnel staff to the hand cut fries. Top of the line. My meal was fabulous-double double cheeseburger and fries. I wish this franchise would come to Central OR! But for now, just nostalgia.< /Review><pics>None<//pics><resp>None</resp><GmapID>0x808fe7ace7d15f17:0xe6db0a27818c9505< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

I have liked In-N-Out Buger for a long time. I used to have to wait until I went to LA to get my burger fix back in the '80s. You can't go wrong with fresh made French fries either.</review>

I had a custom order and Nalini did a great job! What moved me to make this review was the following. I was happy already when withi received my order, as I was grabbing some condiments, Kelsey stopped me and said to return my fries 🍟. She was not satisfied with the quality of that batch I was given. She grabbed them and gave me a new batch. This act reminded me of Chef Ramsey doing a quality control. I was very happy and felt great. Thank you guys.</text><Response>None</Response>< Name>

4th time in 6+ days, super consistent, why does fountain Coke taste so good from all In N Out locations? Maybe they just follow instructions, who knows, hot chilis, just like every OG burger stand in LA used to have.< /Text>

<Review>Good place for burgers, fries and shakes. I really don't care for the thousand island dressing or whatever that sauce is they put on burgers but leave that stuff out and you have a better tasting burger. Tip. Keep the dining room clean. I observed 8 messy tables with no attention.</Review><Pics>None</Pics><username>P B</username></record>

Quick, friendly service with a smile. Burger was great (do it Animal Style!). Fries could be better. Chocolate shake was very light, tasted ok but could use more chocolate.< /Text>

Super busy with loud, rowdy high schoolers when we went on a recent Friday night around 11pm. Many tables not cleaned due to crowds. Veggie burger & fries were good as always. Counter staff is very attentive & helpful.</text>

Ever since this place has opened up (it's been around for a decade) it has given exceptional service. Its fast food the doesn't disappoint but for once the service and people don't either.<//review>

Delicious food as always. The oddest part was the incredibly long wait in the drive thru, especially as it was only 11:15 am and not on a weekend. Second oddest was that the "dine-in" tray they served the two of us had about 2/3rds the fries in one fry container and 1/3 in the other. The size discrepancy was shocking.</review>

The king of fast food burgers, period! I quantify fast food as something you don't have to exit your vehicle for. Are there better burgers to be had? Yes, but there is nothing that compares for the price and availability. Oh yeah BTW, the burgers are off the hook no matter what.< /text>

< Review>
Oh How I Miss You In-N-Out. On my recent trip back to California I made sure that one of my first stops as soon as the plane landed was to visit my long lost animal style fries. They taste as great as I remember. The service was great.  I hear that we might be getting a location here in Denver.  Hope spings eternal!< /Review>

<text>What more is there to say about this California institution? Probably one of the best burgers you can get on the West coast. Always consistent always fresh and always good tasting. I usually go for a protein style Double-Double hamburger.the only not I have is at this place always has constantly long lines either inside the store or outside in the drive through. But hey, that is the price you pay for a great-tasting, affordable, and classic hamburger.< /text><pics>None</pics><Response>None<//Response><GmapID>0x808fe7ace7d15f17:0xe6db0a27818c9505< /GmapID></record>

< Review>
I love in an out, so good. Always fast friendly and clean. Best place for a fast food Burger. You can order it however you like raw onions cooked onions more meat extra cheese I also like that the french fries are cooked fresh they don't have a cheap fast food taste. Every time I try a new place that is supposed to be better than in and out I disagree</Review>

We frequent this In N Out a lot... The staff are always super kind and attentive to customized orders. The food is always great but if there's something you dont like, they make it again for you. The dining room and restrooms are well kept and stocked everytime we've gone. During peak hours, they can handle the rush and still are just as attentive to the specific customer. A++ service, attitude, and facilities.</Review>

Fries leave something to be desired. Hamburgers are good but not the fries.< /Review>

<text>In n out is always delicious and always fast even when they're busy. We ordered 2 animals fries and some burgers and they were sooooo good. Animal fries always take longer but they had our order out super fast. Will definitely go to this location again. Especially since I work down the street.< /text><Pics>None<//Pics>< UserId.>

<Rating>3</Rating><Text>Stopped by for a quick bite to eat with a friend. We were in the mood for fries so we decided to head inside instead of the drive through line thinking it would be quicker. It was around 2:30pm and we waited 15 minutes for 2 orders of french fries only.  Overall was disappointed in the wait time, but enjoyed my food. I would probably recommend to go thru the drive thru window at this location. It's really packed on the inside every time I go and the drive thru line seems to move quicker.< /Text>< pics>

I've been to quite a few In-N-Outs and this one was particularly good. It's easy and right off the highway. Plus the staff was super friendly. It was almost table service. One worker came and picked up our trays without us even asking. Highly recommend<//Review>

<review>The best fast food burgers.
If the burger is the bit you care most about, go here.
They have some weird management practices, like the bible verse citations on the bottoms of the cups and trays, but it is mostly fine. The verse cited on the milkshake cups is anathemic to all intellectualism though; maybe don't buy a milkshake.<//review>< Pictures>

<Text>I gotta say I've never seen a friendlier fast food place. The cashier, Michelle, helped a customer in front of me change their order way after they ordered and make sure they were satisfied. Was very friendly while taking my order. Then I saw a lady ask for a bag and what was both funny and very customer service, she was asked if she needed help by 3 to 4 employees in about 30 seconds. Food was good as usual. My only gripe is that my animal fries were put in the steamer about 5 times and were soggy. Not crispy like normal.< /Text><user_name>Tim Rocca<//user_name>< UserId.>

Hard to say much about an In-N-Out. I find them much more consistent than any other burger chain. This one is typical. The burgers and everything else is prepared exactly as a customer would expect. Dinner was delicious and quickly served. If you like In-N-Out, you will like this one. If you like a well made basic burger, you will like this one. If you want a fancy, gourmet burger, this may nonot be what you want.</text>

In n out and Habit Burger are the two best fast-food burgers available anywhere.  When ordering at in and out, ask for your burger "animal style." It has extra sauce sauteed onions and other goodies. Ask for your fries to be "extra crispy."<//Review>

Have you ever seen an In-n-Out without a single person sitting at a table? That's what happens when you have a pandemic. To-go orders only.</text>

Staff are super friendly and professional.  Wait times can be a little long during lunch and dinner rush (10-15m, 20m in extreme cases) so plan for that.<//text>

It's usually crowded, burgers are fine as far as fast food goes.  Be sure to research the secret menu before you go if you haven't been to an In-N-Out before.</Text>

We rarely eat fast food. I wish that we hadn't eaten here but our Granddaughter  loves the place. The hamburgers were very ordinary. The fries were limp. And my chocolate and vanilla shake was pretty tasteless. Not our kind of place.<//Text>

<Text>In and Out it's by far one of my favorite hamburger places and loved note just by me and my family...but by so many other people! Just check out the line of cars to go thru the drive thru!
They use fresh cut potatoes for your French fries and all fresh food for your burgers!
Hint: when you go to order, look up their secret menu online....
I always order a....

Best burgers and real fries anywhere.
Have it "animal" style.  You can watch as the potatoes are pressed through the fry grater.< /Review>

Hell yes! Cannot go wrong with In n' Out! This is the burger mecca in my opinion. Everytime I visit Cali I will always stop by and get a burger.</Text>

<Text>Food and service was great, however I do not recommend that peope use the drive thru. As that would take much longer, than just walking inside and ordering your meal.< /Text><Rate>4</Rate>< date>

Great food and very fast service! My wife and I stopped in Pleasanton's In N' Out and left due to the excessive line, and parking lot traffic.

Lo' N' Behold 7 miles away lies this golden opportunity for the restaurant. Food fast fast, line was short and faster, and food is how you would expect from this organization.

We also learned that In N Out can cut the burger in quarters for our Toddler, which we greatly appreciated!</review>

< Review>
Who can't say no to in n out. The juicy patties with melting cheese on top along with a animal fries and a cold coke.  Love in n out. It's a must have at least once a month. Once I had in n out 20 times in a month and still tasted good each time. The drive thru here can get long during lunch and dinner but they send someone out to take the orders for a fast service. The shakes aren't bad. I like the strawberry shake. Soon I have to try a 4x4 cheeseburger. But I'm saving it for when I'm starving and craving in n out. So pretty soon..< /Review>

<Text>This particular location is great and worth a review. Most In N Out's can be chaotic and difficult to deal with. This one is busy too but they are very efficient and keep the place clean. I rarely have a hard time getting a table. And the food is delicious as usual. Great staff, well ran.</Text>< time>

Drive through line is always long but if you go inside service is much faster. The food is very good and not greasy. Everything is fresh and made to order.< /Review>

Always a fan of going to In-N-Out when I'm out west. It is something all out of towners should do. I got the double double animal style. So good and well priced. It can take some time to get your food unlike other fast food places but the wait is worth it.<//review>

I hadn't eaten here in years. It didn't taste the way I remembered. I don't eat fast food very often so the problem may be with me.

The service was excellent as usual.<//text>

I thought In And Out was still the best after 8 years, but my most recent trip here in December made me sad. My order took about 20 minutes during a lunch rush and it was only 2 burgers with fries. What I hoped to be superb in every way turned ended up where the buns were burnt and the fries devoid of salt or oil. I honestly believe I would have a better time at wendys close by.< /Text>

<Review>Wait wasn't very long and all the employees seemed really nice. There was one guy that smiled the ENTIRE time I was there. Literally every time I looked at him he was smiling as he walked around cleaning and giving people their food. He's pretty cool and seemed incredibly nice. He threw away our trash for us too.<//Review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

<Review>This food chain is highly overrated. There are no options, there is always a wait. This chain features food that is fresh to death, but thats all. Fresh isn’t always enough to be tasty. The fries could really use a tastier oil and the burgers need some seasoning. A good side sauce could do the small menu some justice.</Review><userid>108195444368709924581</userid><date>1513044019693<//date><Gmap_id>0x808fe7ace7d15f17:0xe6db0a27818c9505</Gmap_id>< Response>

<Review>Todays dine-in experience just somehow was even more pleasant then my drive thru one a couple of days ago -
Best part of both visits =
During peak weekday lunch hours, employees were calm & collective without making you feel rushed unlike certain other so called burger joints within that surrounding area with in the same daily timeframe.< /Review>< Time>

<Review>Had a tight schedule Monday morning around 11am, but wanted my children from Chicago who had already eaten to have a taste of what was suppose to be In-N-Out.
Order 2 fries, 2 milkshakes and one plain cheese burger. After watching the drive in be served for about 12 minutes I asked how long it should take for 2 fries, 2 milkshakes and 1 cheeseburger. After another 5 minutes we finally got our to go order 18 minutes later.
For any walkins expect a In-N-Wait experience.
Don't really need to go back when you've got Val's Burgers as an option...

<Review>I thought in n out motto was “quality you can taste” except where’s the quality at? The past couple of months my food has been burnt and fries aren’t cooked all the way. The woman working at the window giving the food is so rude and disrespectful, she completely ignored me while she was standing right in front of me, thank god some other woman behind her took it upon herself to do the other woman’s job.

I think this place needs some new employees because obviously this location is going downhill with the attitude of the employees and employees just not cooking the food properly. I’d recommend to just drive down to the Pleasanton location.< /Review>< response>

The place to stop when you are on the road and want to take the guesswork out of what you are going to eat. Because it is travel convenient and consistent in quality, it is always busy.<//Text>

Very good service. Food is always tasty here. The restaurant itself is loud, a little messy and rather uncomfortable. Not a Dine-In experience Otherwise a great place</review>

<Time>1473201479588</Time><text>I don't understand why California people are obsessed with In N Out saying it is the best burger place in the state. I have tried it twice and the burger is not terrible, but nothing special. If anything, it is a bit too greasy for me. Not even any plastic forks were provided. The fries are really bad though, not even warm and no taste to them, barely even yellow when they should be golden. And the menu is so limited, in the USA it seems crazy that there is such a place with basically nothing except fries and beefburgers to eat, not even chicken burgers or bacon burgers.< /text>< user_name>

I always go after class for lunch at 11. That is the perfect time to walk in and get a burger, before the rush. Very nice customer service and burgers are always delicious. Never had an issue with them.< /review>

<rating>4<//rating><text>Heading out of town to go skiing with Bay Area traffic is a lesson in patience. Half our drive time was spent just getting to Livermore from the South Bay. Luckily we all had a craving for burgers and this is right off the freeway. I was hoping to wait for the Tracy one but we were just going too slow. Lucky to because when we drove by the Tracy one the car line was into the street and the parking lot was packed.
I tried out a double double animal style with green chilies off the not so secret menu and it was good but still not enough chilies. I didn't want to risk getting them chili cheese fries on a long road trip. Will have to save that adventure for a closer potty.<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None< /response>< GmapID>

Though fast food is not the best thing to put into your body, if you are going to eat it, this is the place to go.  Burgers and fries are top-notch.  Staff is friendly and they keep the place clean.< /review>

I tried 2 times in n out burgers. And both times were disgusting. Not going there anymore once. The fries are 100% blend, they taste like flour and the burger steak+ bun have a very cheap taste. I guess I could have expected it.</text>

Food was cold when we got it.  Waited 30 minutes to get it and had to ask why they took 5 orders in front of ours. They made my 86 year old father wait needlessly. We won't go back there.< /review>

What's not to love about In-N-Out. Great fresh fries, delicious burgers, secret menus, refillable drinks (hasn't seem to catch on in Asia) and customizable items. I wish they had a chain in Asia.

One of my stops every time I go home to California.< /text>

Always great service and great food.   The reason for only 4 stars is they forgot the grilled onions on my sandwich and when you get French fries Animal Style,  the won't layer it.< /Review>

You can never go wrong with In-N-Out Burger. The staff is always pleasant and my order is always right.  The wait may be a little long at time but it's In-N-Out so it's worth it.<//text>

This store was very crowded when we were there. That being said, they did a nice job getting our food quickly. It was loud at the outside tables due to freeway noise. Had my standard Gluten Free Flying Dutchman with fries, with an iced tea. I think the total was about $6.00 for my meal.<//review>

Everybody knows this place already. If you are from Mars this review is for you. They serve beef with raw veggies between 2 buns. Less one star for constant wait to get food, which is worth it.<//review>

<Text>i think only californian natives like these place. the french fries are not good at all and the burger is decent but the line is so so so long and why do they make the workers wear those weird clothes? also when i come with my friends (which i have a lot of) we don’t fit at one table but the tables and chairs are attached to the ground so we have to sit separate. wow</Text>< Pictures>

Best food ever! Simple choices and gets prepared fresh. Only bummer is there's always a wait here. And never go.in drive-thru. Going inside is much faster than being stuck in drive-thru for 25 minutes.</Review>

Service is good, as are the burgers, but something is off with their fries. They always taste stale, or like the fry oil hasn't been changed in a while.</Review>

Even though this location is always busy, I always stop here headed home on 580. Their speed at getting people through is unlike any other In-N-Out I've been to (which is saying something, as they're pretty fast).< /Text>

<review>Great place to stop at midnight on a cross country drive. We felt invited since indoor dining was allowed. Thanks for being open and the food was great. Easy on/off freeway with loaded uhaul truck and trailer. Gas station nearby too. Thanks.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None<//Resp><gmapID>0x808fe7ace7d15f17:0xe6db0a27818c9505< /gmapID></record>

<Review>(Translated by Google) A decent hamburger at an inexpensive price. Because it is a famous chain, it is worth visiting. But if you need to find a restaurant because it is close to a good fast food restaurant, it is not too bad to look for other alternatives. Patty likes to add.

(Original)
비싸지 않은 가격에 괜찮은 맛의 햄버거. 원체 유명한 체인이라 한 번 가볼만은 한데 가성비 좋은 패스트푸드점에 가까워서 맛집을 찾아야겠다면 꼭 여기 말고 다른 대안을 찾아보는 것도 나쁘진 않음. 패티는 추가하는 게 좋아요.<//Review>< Pics>

<text>(Translated by Google) The hamburger was double wrapped and only half inside (feeling like a crescent) was tight, so it was hard to break down to the end and it was easy to eat. Lettuce, tomato and onion were fresh and delicious. Potato is delicious in McDonald's in Japan.

(Original)

<Review>(Translated by Google) I do not think it is a chain store delicious!
The clerk is bright and friendly and the work is fast.
Hamburgers are devised to make it easier to eat, and the taste is also good!
French fries are crisp and tasty even when time goes on. Salt is a separate attachment so you can adjust the taste yourself.
Ice tea was impressive that cut lemon was put. Everything is Good.

(Original)
チェーン店と思えないおいしさ！
店員さんは明るくて愛想がよくて、仕事が早い。
ハンバーガーは食べやすいように工夫されており、味もGood！
フレンチフライはカリッとしていて時間が立ってもおいしいです。塩は別添えなので自分で味の調整ができますよ。
アイスティーはカットレモンが置いてあるのが印象的でした。すべてがGoodです。</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None<//Response>< GmapID>

(Translated by Google) Always a good option to take away. Attentive, at a good price, they take sometimes, but it's worth it.
