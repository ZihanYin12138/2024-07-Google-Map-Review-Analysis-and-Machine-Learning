I drive all they way from Mission Viejo and pass by more than a dozen places I could get work done for my car. I couldn't be more satisfied with my experience here throughout the years. I bring my girlfriend, my friends and my family here because I know Adrian will take care of us from start to finish. If you want HONEST, quick, dependable work. Come here. Thank you.</Text>

Customer service excellent. Very professional and knowledgeable regarding transmission issues. The work was done well; the problem repaired and they even went above and beyond by fixing a minor battery issue and did not charge us. I would highly recommend service here.< /Review>

<rating>5< /rating><text>Adrian helped me with my BMW's transmission. They did an excellent job and my car run's good as new, with a plus of an added 1 year warranty on it. I then took my car back to get some work on gaskets and the cooling system, they made my car leak free! Excellent service and Adrian gave great customer service. I will definitely come again, and I highly recommend to others!<//text>< date>

I am absolutely thrilled with this AAMCO!! I was in cold sweat because my car didn't work and I had little money. My other mechanic was going to charge me $180 for a diagnostic! Theses guys did it for free!! They also helped me with a payment plan so I can drive the car today and pay it over the next few months!!! Chris, especially, was wonderful and walked me through every step of the way!! I trust these guys and feel they are good quality mechanics!! I would use them anytime and recommend them to anybody!!!< /text>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Review>Anthony really went the extra mile to change my experience with auto mechanics. Not only was he concerned with getting my manual transmission car running at peak performance again, but he was concerned with me getting to work on time and provided transportation while my car was in the shop. I never expected this level of service from any auto mechanic. He also went out of his way to get a part for my car, same day, that hadn't been diagnosed, saving me around $200 (since the transmission was already out of the vehicle). I feel respected as a client and I am absolutely grateful for Anthony's honesty and customer-first work ethic.< /Review>< Time>

<Text>I called AAmco to get a second opinion on a repair that my dealership told me that I needed. (Major leak from the transmission cooler. Apx $2,500) I had been told. I called Dave. He said bring the car in I'd like to take a look at it. The diagnostic was free. Dave called me back a couple hours later to let me know that there was no major leak found and that the only low fluid level was my power steering. I will take all my vehicles to Dave from now on. It's nice to have a honest shop to go to. I recommend that you take your car's here as well.<//Text>< Pictures>

<Text>Firs I was told that if I paid $150.00 they would diagnose the trouble with my car and tell me the total cost for the repair. I was then told everything could be fixed for $748.00. I approved the repair for $748.00. When I went to pick up my car it had the exact same problem. Then after 3 more days they told me that now they needed and extra $2,000.00 to fix the problem. They then said that the $748.00 was needed to see that I now needed to pay an additional $2,000.00.

They threatened me. They told me in front of the police officer that they illegally record the phone conversations without letting their customers know.  They charged my credit card without authorization. I had to have the Santa Ana Police Department come to the location before they would give me my car back.

Stay away from this place, they are a bunch of thieves.</Text><time>1465253073335<//time><Rating>1< /Rating>< userid>

<review>Appreciate the honesty.  After a mis diagnoses and astronomical quote for an alternator fix at the VW dealer, I called Adrian at Aamco and received a quote within reason.  What really made my day is that after the initial test at aamco, there was actually nothing wrong with it.  It was the battery.  Went to oreillys and it was deemed defective and replaced at no charge!  Thank you Adrian and crew!<//review>< user_id>

They said my truck would be ready by Sat... And it's Tuesday already. I really hate to bother them and call to know when my Tahoe will be ready, but I need my damn truck. First and last time dealing with these guys. I have to go ahead and call them once again because they assured me that my truck would be ready today. They haven't called, so I have to be the one calling them. I would mention names but I blame the whole team and staff at this particular amcco. I want my money back plus money I lost due to their tardiness and dishonesty that's  if it's not ready by tonight. All 2500 dollars for the rebuilt of the transmission plus 500 dollars I lost due to work absence. We can settle this with a 750 dollar discount and put that money back into my dad's visa.< /Review>

(Translated by Google) I see that I am not the only one who told him that with the diagnosis of $ 150 dollars they will give me an estimate of the total cost of the repair !!

They made me spend more than $ 800 dollars to later tell me that I needed another part of $ 1600 dollars and that if that was not left then it would be $ 2600 + the $ 800 that they had taken out at the beginning !!

Keep away from this place! Not recommended to change a battery because even for that I wanted to get $ 180 dollars ...

Now I will have my car back exactly as I leave them with the same fault but with more than $ 800 dollars thrown away ...

(Original)
Veo que no soy el unico que le dijeron que con el diagnostico de $150 dolares me ivan a dar un estimado del costo total de la reparacion!!

Me hicieron gastar mas de $800 dolares para despues decirme que necesitaba otra parte de $1600 dolares y que si asi no quedaba entonces serian $2600 + los $800 que me habian sacado al inicio!!

Mantengance alejados de este lugar!! No recomendable ni para cambiar una bateria porque hasta para eso me querian sacar $180 dolares...

Ahora voy a tener mi carro de regreso exactamente como se los deje con la misma falla pero con mas de $800 dolares tirados a la basura...</review>

This place is so sad.
Needs lots of fixing up, more donations done 😞 better food and sleeping area's for people.
Proper bathrooms too.
I hope the country figure out what needs to be done for the homeless, if they do decide to fix it up i would suggest drug testing everyone. And make it more of a family shelter...then maybe build a men's area.
And add a mini church.</Text>

My fiance and i were passing through and hungry but didn't need shelter at the time because we have a car. Was warmly welcomed in for dinner and turned away when we sat down due to not staying the night in the shelter. Very disappointing due to the fact that  to be "Christian" is to be "Christ like ". Jesus wouldnt have turned down anyone who is hungry whether they were staying or just coming through because they were hungry. This is the second shelter we have stopped at on our road trip that has turned us down for something. Next day we stopped for sack of lunch and was turned down while everyone else was welcomed in having a hot lunch. We were handed four fiber one bars and a loaf of sourdough bread. Very thankful for anything !! Not complaining about that but as Christians and a Christian ministry shouldn't we be serving Christ and not the people or for ourselves ?? Gods word is posted all over the walls in the building talking about how to walk in Gods word and to be Christ like but yet we have Servants of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ turning people down for food ??? There is seriously something wrong with this picture when this place receives plenty of donations to support feeding the hungry and giving them shelter. Out of all those who we spoke with in that building there was only one man with his heart and mind in the right place and he said to us there was plenty of food and he would be wrong to turn us down if we are hungry. He even told us to sit down and enjoy a meal...just as Jesus would have. May God Bless that man and give him his own ministry for the homeless so it is done the way Jesus would want it done. God bless<//Text>

Mike is one of kindest people in this town! He has such a beautiful vision for people! I took my cash mob in to mob his thrift store once. The gratitude we felt is something that will warm my heart for a lifetime! He would help an injured fly if he could! Thank you Mike Justice!<//text>

No wait time, pulled right in, filled quickly & after gassing up pulled into car wash & left HAPPY, full & Squeeky Clean! Always a GREAT spot to stop, ESPECIALLY if you live in the foothills or just out of Clovis- it's the last gas station on hwy168 before heading up into the foothills, drinks, food, restrooms, gas, car wash, tons of snacks, and GREAT morning COFFEE!< /review>< Date>

Good gas station right off the 168 Highway. Prices are generally higher than Costco and other station, but the location and performance of their gas is great. I always feel like my car is more powerful after pumping at Chevron. Across the street (East) is McDonald's. Starbucks, Subway, and Me n Eds are South of the station, in the same complex.<//Text>

Gas is a little pricey compared to other stations. I don't mind paying because I know the quality of gas is much better for me engine.< /Text>

< Review>
Overpriced Fuel Prices.
Often are out of 87 and 89 octane fuel.
Cleanliness of the inside of the store is often unsatisfactory. Poor car wash. Vacuums are broken but not marked.< /Review>

<text>I had a great experience this time around. I called to see if an item was in stock. Kris answered the phone and found it for me pretty quickly. Nicolas helped me out by getting some sidewalk chalk off a high storage shelf when it wasn’t in the customer area. When I checked out, Kris was my clerk and again she was super nice and helpful. Very good visit. Thank you!<//text>< time>

I was told I can exchange the printer within the warranty time frame. I have to download the file on pdf then wait to see if the printer feels like printing and hopefully it doesn't print only one tenths of the page before it says printer error. I've been dealing with the headache of printing paperwork from work for 3 months since I bought it. Now they say I can't exchange it for a upgrade even though they have my warranty on file because they only accept returns for 14 days. I paid 49.99 for the 4 year warranty they didn't value only after almost 3 months. I suggest you go to Walmart target or somewhere else for office goods. You only have 14 days on printer's or anything electronic. They sell you garbage. It's like going to crazy Gillian's. RUDE management here as well.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

This Staples is like the rest, with a great selection of all things office and work-related. The prices on some items are going to be a lot better, but some are more expensive, than say, Walmart or Target. Harder-to-find items are probably here, or they can order it for you. From electronics to furniture, to highlighters, to wall maps, they have it here.<//Text>

<Text>Great store, same with the idea to buy a new printer since mine did not work anymore even with replacement of ink cartridges( reman. a mistake )
A smart Technician named Joey asked me to bring my old printer in, and gave it a "tune up " and new brand name cartridges, the printer works great again,no Charge for the Tech's work.
He could have sold me a new printer !    FIVE STARS<//Text><rating>5< /rating><Time>1553829130948< /Time>< Response>

The customer service at this store is great. I was in a rush to have a document printed and I was attended to quickly by the ladies at the Print and Copy center. I'm not local to the area, but will come here again if I have business needs in the area< /Review>

<gmapID>0x80dd31959f0c23ff:0xdf9f0bf13e463d35<//gmapID><text>Being a graphic design student, there are times where we need to print something large in high quality. Stuck without a printer large enough for an 11x17 glossy poster, we turn to commercial printing services with their huge expensive machines and we pay them money in return for an A-worthy print job.

This place is not it.

The staff seems like they don't know what they're doing, the print quality is terrible, the color came out wrong. There are just a ton of things that can go wrong when you print here. Kinkos is not a good alternative, but it's probably better than here. Go to other staples, even. Just not this one.

I was there for 15 minutes with nobody to help me, and I wasn't spared even an inch of friendliness. Not a smile, a grin, a glance. A terrible terrible experience that left me feeling even more frustrated. If the associate working there is a slightly chubby long black haired girl wearing glasses it's better if you turn back and come back another time.<//text>< date>

My cashier helped me with everything, my membership number, an online coupon, ink cartridge return and locating the sale price on my item I purchased. Great Job!< /Review>

Rated only one star as I couldn't rate ZERO STARS. Today was Very HOT we are in a Heat Wave. Walked inside to purchase inkjet toner and I commented how hot it was inside.
The Staples sales rep told me the AC was broke, on.... As I am looking at the toner it dawned on me that all 4 package unit AC's were off. So I ask the Staples sales rep a question about the ink jet toners, I also asked how it was possible that all 4 Ac units could all break down at once, he said they did, than proceeded to tell me that the store was trying to save money!!!
Well, I walked out of there as it must have been over 90 degrees and want to Office Depot in Signal Hill, where their Ac worked and bought my toner and paper and other items and spent $130.00.
If you can't afford to run the AC, I am not shopping in your store and you have no business being in business.  This isn't a 3rd world country.
Your store is not offering any special deals and cut rate pricing on anything, especially Toner
I'll go else were for my office supplies.
Like Office Depot<//text>

A clean store with a very pleasant and helpful staff.  Not as much of a selection in the snack section as I would prefer, but they had what I needed.<//Text>

So if your coming here to buy a chair this is not the place so I came here and found a very comftortable chair i wanted to buy but they didn't have it in stock so we ordered it to the store and payed a 15 dollar fee for them to put it together for us so then we come back a week later and they had the chair but it wasn't built, then we come back 2 weeks later and they had the chair built we were happy then person that built it did a terrible job the arm wrest was loose and the chair back kept going back as I sat it in it so later we took it back now today I picked it up and its great works fine but the chair is supposed to lean back and it did but it just broke 10 mins. ago as i'm sitting in it but the chair is still fine but nothing i can do because its much of a hassle and i'm just gonna be happy as is.</review>

<Text>I ordered a Chuck Strawberry bowl with extra granola on the side and paid for it. I got it in a large cup instead, watery, with less granola (to my knowledge I paid for the extra amount, so I assume they gave me less for that reason) and too much banana. If I was informed ahead of time that they were going do this I would have not ordered it and gone to a different one. This jamba juice used to be my go to but honestly its been a couple times where the smooties and the bowls just come out uninspiring. Thank you for your service but I will no longer come here.</Text><Gmap_id>0x80c2c916c235d959:0xcef579c9cb0e9528<//Gmap_id>< Rate>

<review>It's close by our house so we come here for a craving on a hot day. LOVE their chunky strawberry acai bowls, so bomb! Parking is a bit iffy since its in a plaza with a bunch of retailers so when its packed its hard to find parking.</review>< username>

So for me < - - it is a 5 star.

As a side note - Take these reviews with a grain of salt, if you look at a lot of the bad post like the guy under mine, you will notice they spend a lot of time just posting bad reviews on almost everything, some people are just overly critical and will not hesitate to exaggerate 1 visit.</text><Resp>{'time': 1466109010606, 'text': 'Manny Mora Thank you for taking the time out of your day to write this review, Jamba appreciates it very much.

My friend and I tried Jamba Juice for the first time. We ordered a twist of chocolate yogurt and coconut yogurt, and it was very good. The flavor was very nice, and the combo went well together. The atmosphere of the store was laid back, and not busy at all.</Review>

<rate>1< /rate><Text>This place has always been empty when I go get a smoothie. I've been to other jamba juice where they give you the extra juice that's left over in a small kids cup FREE, that  most of the time doesn't even get full half way in the kids cup. The guy doing the smoothie told me they aren't allowed to do that, that they usually charge $.75 cents. This is the 1st I hear about this since I've always ask to get what's left over. I mean I have paid for the smoothie in a large etc. That dude was straight tripping. Not going back there again! The smoothie was so sour I did not enjoyed it one bit. Yuck!</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

The worst açaí moothie I’ve ever had is from this place. Paying $8.00 and I ended up throwing it away. The most flavorless smoothie ever. I buy the same smoothie from different Jamba’s and they’re nothing like the one I bought here. STOP diluting the açaí concentrate with too much water. Give your costumers what we’re paying for.<//Text>

<review>My favorite! The fancy pastries looked spectacular this morning! 😋
I, however, stuck to a breakfast bagel sandwich and coffee.
Love the friendly family shops... So much better tasting than the big name ones that everyone was so thrilled to have come to Santa Maria.. some of them don't even make their donuts here, but ship them in from central facilities elsewhere<//review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

I love this place. Super friendly and good selection. They have your regular well known donuts and some specialty donuts. They also do breakfast sandwiches with either a bagel or crossiant. I come here probably more than I should but they're just so damn good.<//Review>

My favourite doughnut shop in town! They're always so friendly whenever I go in to order doughnuts or my favourite Thai Iced Tea. In fact, whenever I walk in now the lady always knows I'm getting one and just automatically asks if I want a small or large one. 😂 It's fantastic. Also love coming here with my fiance and friends. Will always recommend to come here. 💜</text>

< Review>
When we arrived we didn't see a whole lot of donuts. The owner said she had more in the back. I asked about apple fritters and she looked at her husband and he said 5 minutes, they were in the fryer. We waited patiently and boy was it worth it! One of them had broken so she gave us a sample...it was pure heaven. After grabbing an assortment and sampling them when we got home we realized why they didn't have a lot displayed...they sell out as soon as they are made! Yummmm!< /Review>

If you get there early enough they have super cute and delicious donuts designed in house. This is a great place to take if you have kids if you want oreo donuts or animal circus cookie donuts. I had a pink leminade donut that had raspberry frosting and lemon jelly in the middle and it was so good. And every once in a while they have Star Wars donuts so of course you gotta grab a Darth Vader bar when you get the chance.< /review><pics>None< /pics><resp>None</resp><GmapID>0x80ec6ca63af620a3:0xd27dfad0de824fcd</GmapID></record>

The cinnamon buns are delicious but so is everything else. So grateful for the staff who helped me carry my donuts to the car as I was carrying a baby and running after a toddler.<//text>

<Text>I will never go back to this donut shop again! The guy behind the counter was so rude to me! I turned around and walked right out. Maybe he was having a bad day, but he didn’t have to take it out on me!</Text>< Pics>

I tried this donuts were not good, not soft, bad taste. The communication was bad when I enter. A couple were talk loud in their language. I was unhappy for my visit.< /review>

Great, great food American and Mexican comfort food! We just discovered this gem and have enjoyed trying several things. The homemade salsas spice things up nicely. Staff is friendly and care about their customers.

If they see you have a dog in the car, they give you doggy treats!

Support this local restaurant! Cash only!< /text>

Great little local breakfast spot!!  Got the trio omelette with Avocado and it was delish.  I would leave off the American cheese next time.  Great service even for takeout!< /review>

It was a pleasant surprise to find this little family owned business. Not surprised to see they have regulars as the service is great and the food is good. Simplicity at it's finest with American and Mexican dishes on the menu, you get what you see hahaha, not to knock it down at all. It is a great place to stop by and Happy to see outdoor seating 😁 as I love to eat in the restaurant atmosphere. Only thing I'll say is don't be surprised  if some one wants to spark up a conversation as everyone is very friendly which adds to the mom and pop culture this place is.<//Review>

Good cafe food. I went in for bfast on a Sunday around 1p, got a booth right away, had pancakes and eggs with bacon. Reasonable prices. I didn't know, they don't accept credit cards. So I had to find cash. Otherwise it was a good meal.< /Review>

Service is ok. Prices are fair and food always tastes fresh. They also have high chairs and children's cups for your little ones to enjoy their food. Open every day from 6am - 2pm. Great breakfast before heading off to your local church on a Sunday .<//Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMHOoXEd5G56fxj7aijx6o540zQ3a_nVpS7wGXu=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmap_id>

I asked for  rancheros eggs...but they are not that great those expense expecting them to taste good and their Mexican beans were too salty . I do not recommend the restaurant.
The waitress and her service was good<//review>

<review>Covid testing is super unorganized...had everyone waited over an hour and a half for everyone to get tested...and instead of testing people the were in front of the line in order...they split the line into two and started testing people who were in the back of line...they put everyone test swabs in a bin and ask for name and have dig for your swab. There was roughly 20-25 of us...was 6th or 7th in line and somehow ended up last to get swab...< /review>< rate>

< Review>
I’m a health care worker as well so I try my best to be understanding but this place is a Waste of time staff is straight up rude and they know it and don’t care, I don’t understand how higher management just allows this looking at the other reviews i know im not alone when I say this.. I went for a covid rapid test, took 1:45mins for them to help ANYONE, I was the first in line at that. Staff was very rude. I asked about approximately the wait time “there isnt a time frame and you need to go outside” as one staff was on the computer and the rest standing there laughing and hanging out..then at 10:30 AM I called as I was standing out there and they said this is an “everyday thing and it usually takes well over an hour” I expressed that’s fine the wait isn’t an issue but why not let patients know for a heads up? They stated “we don’t have to and this is an everyday thing unless you need something else I need to get back to work” just straight rude. It reflects management more than anything for allowing the staff to be so openly rude to us. Their protocol makes no sense. As I said I’m a healthcare worker myself I don’t think any of us patients were asking anything unreasonable when we asked at 10a about how much longer for the even the first person to be seen.<//Review>

Why it deserves three stars instead of 2 or 1 is their nurse practitioner Thang.  She had an excellent bedside manner and was knowledgeable about my acute condition.  I'd go back, but only if she was the one who would see me.</Text>< pics>

Awesome experience!  Loved being able to book appointment and download paperwork online.  I don’t think i even waited more than 10 minutes before i was shown to room.  Everyone was so nice - will definitely be coming back for future urgent care needs.</text>

I am very impressed with the entire staff and mobile check-in process. Every staff member earned 5 stars+ and I’ll definitely return to this location anytime I may need urgent care in the future! Thank you for taking great care and being so very friendly and kind!< /Text>

Thang Yang PA is so professional and kind and has a great sense of humor! She walked me through all of my symptoms, took time and care to listen to me and was just amazing! Her team for the x-rays, the front desk--- everyone is so professional and you can feel the team spirit at their urgent care facility.  I highly recommend Natomas Urgent Care, these professionals truly care about you and your health!<//review>

I did not like how I could not schedule an appointment online. When I called and asked to schedule it over the phone, they said you are unable to. It is first come first serve basis. I came and had to wait a while for them to even give me paperwork to sign and then waited in the car for the actual covid test. By the time the test came, they never told me how much it was or gave me an option to choose. They just said it had to be done through the nose. It hurt getting a covid test.<//text>

My husband arrived at 8 am this morning for a covid test. Office  is supposed to open at 9 am till 1 for testing.. 2 1/2 hours later he walked inside to ask why so long, it's very cold outside. The girl behind the desk advised him that "we cannot control the weather" ..really? Such compassion,  Not!, and that the tests do not take priority! Dr. Faucci, where are you!
Why dont they show up at 8am to prepare for patients if they open at 9am and it takes over an hour to prepare? They open at 9 but are not ready until, oh let's see, 2 hours later! Then they start the process. If you choose this site to test you will need a tent, a propane heater and extra batteries for your phone! Good luck.< /text>

<user_name>Biz Ellis<//user_name><Time>1593047022829< /Time><rating>4</rating><review>I had a minor cut. The bleeding was more than any cut I have had and I was worried about infection. I booked online and showed at my time. Everything went smoothly at check in and I paid copay. One thing I didn’t expect was that a staff member yelled of my (street name) was my correct address. Seems unprofessional as it is personal information and on my drivers license. A copy was taken so I could have confirmed it at that time. All the paperwork had the Elk Grove location listed so that would be a nice correction.

I waited for about 5-7 minutes. I take was quick and I was seen in as many minutes. I felt like I was treated well and treated with care. I’m glad for the close location and would return in the future.< /review>< pics>

Scheduled a video appointment to have a suspected skin infection looked at, as I had my 20 month old with me and did not want to risk a waiting room when video was offered as a valid option.

Was logged in at 12:45 p.m. through Solv Health. The person who did the intake told me there were 5 people in person ahead of me, and to be patient but that I'd be seen. After 4 hours, I called the office directly, and I was told the practitioner would be told that I was waiting so that I could be seen. I asked if I would definitely be seen tonight, even if there was more of a wait. They assured me I would be seen.

The office apparently doesn't keep any order regarding the remote patients - will only see them when there are no remaining walk ins. I didn't find this out unfortunately until 7 p.m. at which I was told I wouldn't be seen tonight after all. My choices are reschedule or go to an ER if I get worse. Maggie, who I spoke to on the phone who had assured me that I would be seen, said "I know" when I told her I might be hospitalized because of the complete waste of my time all day waiting for their services.

They should not be part of the Solv network of providers if they cannot or will not provide service.<//text>

Called for information on COVID testing and was interrupted with the words “We’re done”. Now I’m trying to pry information out of receptionist, can you tell me more? “We’re done today 30 people per day M-F”. Hangs up on me.

Dear Natomas Urgent Care, you probably get this same call many times a day. I suggest you make a phone notification of when testing has ended for the day.

Allowing your staff to answer calls like this is harmful, you must realize people are greatly dependent on your business as a healthcare facility.<//review>

While waiting for over an hour and a half I was told covid testing doesn’t take priority. While 50 plus people waiting outside with no specific area to wait. While everyone being exposed due to unorganization on urgent cares part. Maybe there should be more training a d compassion during this time, or just get rid of your employees with bad bedside manner, it doesn’t belong in the medical field</review>< Response>

< review>
The doctors here are really nice, and have been helpful.  I’ve been here a few times.  The last time I was here however they billed our insurance incorrectly by billing one service as two services, so our insurance refused to pay for the duplicate service.  As an in-network provider they should have only billed for the coinsurance.  But they back billed us for the amount our insurance didn’t pay (they refused to pay for one service split into two).  I paid it because I didn’t want to spend hours on the phone arguing with them and my insurance.  For that reason we won’t be coming back.  Med 7 accurately bills services as well as UC Davis medical group, so we will be going there in the future.  The medical service deserves 5 stars, but being back-billed for an in-network service is upsetting. I’m not sure if that is legal for in-network providers because that is violating the conditions of their in-network status.<//review>

<Text>They need to get fixed their website. I was scheduled later 9 in the morning but when i got there, they just told me that they are rescheduling all patients who were testing, because they were out of stuff. They should’ve called day before which i asked them but they said they did. I’ve received any call from them!!

I don’t like to leave bad reviews, but I felt the need to do so because I don’t want anyone to go through what I just did.

My terrible experience comes from my care by PA Karen. I was having acute back and right leg nerve pain. Even with flexeril (muscle relaxant), tramadol (narcotic pain med), and ibuprofen 600mg (pain med and anti-inflammatory), the pain going down my right leg was unbearable, to the point where I could not walk or drive properly. I also explained to her that I have been seeing a physical therapist regularly to solve the root cause of my pain. Karen recommended I receive a steroid and toradol shot. I did not want injectable therapy, and asked for gabapentin instead to help with the nerve pain. She would not prescribe me gabapentin but insisted on steroid therapy with a toradol shot. I asked her why she was uncomfortable with gabapentin, as it is recommended in clinical guidelines for neuropathic pain, even in acute settings such as post-operative pain. She told me that gabapentin will not solve the core of the problem. I understood where she was coming from, but I felt that she was not understanding the pain that I am going through, which was the excruciating nerve pain going down my leg. I still needed something to help curb my nerve pain, which is what gabapentin targets.

As a clinician myself with training in an acute care hospital, it’s disturbing that PA Karen would lean to injectable steroids and toradol as her first line of therapy. I even pulled up data from clinical trials and Lexicomp (clinical database), and there was an abundance of clinical data that supports the use of gabapentin for acute neuropathic pain. I tried to show PA Karen this data that I was able to find,  but she dismissed me saying if I want a second opinion, to go somewhere else.

Please try to view this from a patient’s experience, who took the time to go to this urgent care, in a lot of pain, and then to be told to go somewhere else because the PA doesn’t want to prescribe a med that I need. It’s a med that is indicated for my condition, not a controlled substance, and something that the patient personally prefers and is much safer than jumping the gun with injectable steroid therapy.

I eventually spoke to an administrator, who recommended for me to go to their other urgent care.

Overall, as a patient of this clinic and a clinician myself, I was very disappointed and disturbed by the care I received. I understand that a clinician should never prescribe or do something they are uncomfortable with, but to insist on avoiding APPROPRIATE therapy for the patient is absolutely ridiculous. The PA was rejecting evidence based medicine. That is just terrible...!!! In addition, to tell a patient who is in pain and had a long struggle to even get to the clinic itself was very hurtful and disappointing.

I highly recommend you avoid this urgent  care and seek clinical help elsewhere..< /review>

<Review>We visited this clinic for an eye problem. Arrived at 8 p.m. and was not examined by Dr. James Wedell until 8:45 p.m. even though there were no other patients waiting. Dr. James Wedell did not provide good customer service and was not very professional. We will not be returning.</Review></record>

< Review>
Roads to the back of the fields (3,4,5-a and b) should be fixed. They are too small for two cars to pass each other(one way in and out) and the pot holes are crazy back there. Also, the bathrooms have crazy spiders in them and hand sanitizer stations should be placed near all porta potties. But other than that the place is nice.. plenty of fields but get there early for parking 🤦🏾‍♂️</Review>

This is one of the best places to use. The staff is friendly, knowledgeable, and extremely helpful. The doctor keeps up with the latest information. He found a serious conflict between two medications which was especially important to know. And he is an exceedingly kind person. All these attributes are hard to find in doctors these days.
My covid-19 vaccine went very well. Did not feel the shot at all. It was an efficient setup as well.</Text>

Staff is very friendly and professional.  The wait was minimal and service A-1!  My wife has been seeing Dr Buddiga for about a year now and is very happy that she chose him for her Allergist.  Another thing she likes about the office staff is they WILL ANSWER the phone when you call; you don't get some stupid automated system that makes you jump through numerous hoops when you need to talk to some one.  That in and by itself makes them deserve an A+ rating.< /text>

I’m a college student that was going to this office for treatment, I didn’t have insurance at first and was for months paying out of pocket for my inhalers, shots, and appointments. Finally got insurance for the last year of my treatment, 6 months before I was completely finished, without calling, texting, leaving a message, emailing, or regular mailing me a warning, they terminated the contract with my insurance, I found out when I went to get my shot on a Tuesday they told me they will not give me the shot, or treat me, there is no referral and no transfer, and I will now have to start this whole process over again. It was also incredibly difficult to get the Doctor to keep up with my prescriptions and I was constantly having to call the office. 1 star.<//text>

Susan was very nice and explained what my insurance covered and the prices of allergy testing before receiving care. This was nice because I wasn’t hit with any surprises after my appointment. The assistants and the Doctor were very nice as well! I’m glad I found this clinic. I will be making an appointment for my husband as well!

My father and I both came here for our vaccinations, all the staff is so nice and helpful. The front desk people are just so sweet even when calling and Dr. Buddiga made sure to answer any questions I had about the vaccination. I definitely recommend this place for vaccinations and will be coming here for any further allergy problems I may have in the further!<//review>

<review>I went to Family Allergy Asthma Clinic with my husband to get COVID vaccines and what a great experience! They made sure everyone was being safe by staying socially distant and wearing masks. Dr. Buddiga answered all of our questions and administered the shot himself. It was quick and painless. Dr. Buddiga and his entire staff was so friendly and helpful. Now I'm actually looking forward to going back for my 2nd shot. Thank you Family Allergy Asthma Clinic for helping to keep us all safe!<//review>< Pics>

At Family Allergy Asthma Clinic you get a great doctor AND great front office staff. This is important to me because I've often sacrificed my front office experience in order to have access to a great doctor.
Dr. Buddiga takes the time to sit and listen to his patients. He's also caring and honors your time so you aren't left sitting in his waiting room past your scheduled appointment.
One of my family members recommended Family Allergy Asthma Clinic, and it's the best medical recommendation I've had in two decades.<//Text>

<Text>Dr. Buddiga is a wonderful doctor. I received my first COVID-19 vaccine today. The entire procedure
(paperwork and shot administered) was completed in under 30 minutes. Dr. Buddiga and his entire staff are professional and very friendly and caring. They make you feel at ease. My husband was a patient of Dr. Buddiga’s, until we had to change insurance carriers. We were sad to have to say goodbye to everyone in the office. We highly recommend Family Allergy and Asthma Clinic.</Text><pics>None< /pics><resp>None< /resp><Gmap_id>0x80945cd769b28eed:0xb603afcf33e9c92< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Treatment is always quick and painless, and the staff does a great job of showing genuine concern and interest in patient well being.

<rate>5< /rate><resp>None</resp><review>Dr. Buddiga is intelligent and a caring Allergist. In our experience with him, we’ve noticed that he is attentitive, listens to us and our concerns, understands the importance of building rapport and has the background experience to identify issues and use his expertise to try and solve it. Our son has a bad case of eczema and with given medications, my sons skin always clears up, but then returns once the prescription is done with. Although we haven’t quite found something that works for our sons skin, we have positive thoughts going forward and seeing what Dr. Buddiga has to offer.< /review>< GmapID>

When I got to the Central Valley the allergies started I visited an allergy center in Fresno and they only prescribed some generic Costco allergy pills ... like this for years !!!  Until a friend recommended Family Allergy Asthma Clinic to me, the first visit was the evaluation and the second and third tests to see what I am allergic to ... and now if to perform a treatment as it should be.  His staff is excellent and cordial, very attentive to his patients and the Dr. Buddiga Praveen  is very dedicated with his work and professionalism.<//text>

<review>One of the worst asthma clinics I have ever been too. Very rude and unprofessional. Hung up on my face twice when asked about my results! I DO NOT recommend this place. Every time I ask to speak with a nurse, they tell me the same thing that I’ve been told a week ago. I called a few days prior asking the same thing and was told the same thing, yet have not received a call back from anybody like I was supposed too. The receptionists and the doctors need to do their JOB.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>{'time': 1599100604182, 'text': 'Dear Adrian\nWe have conducted all the tests that you requested for your condition and have relayed the results to you in a timely manner .

Dr.Buddiga saved my life by diagnosing me correctly and immediately as a positive COVID patient 2 weeks ago and got me transferred and treated at a local hospital. The test was positive in the hospital and the doctors treated me swiftly with steroids and some type of IV antibodies. I am very lucky to have supportive doctors. Me and my family thank you and all the nurses, EMT's and others who have given me a second chance.< /Review>

I had a wonderful experience with Dr. Buddiga and his staff at Family Allergy. I had been struggling with hives for years and I was able to get in to see the doctor right away and figure it out. The front desk was  very kind and helpful, the nurse was also very kind and informative, and after meeting Dr. Buddiga himself I can see that whole staff is a reflection of his care for his work and his patients. I have already recommended a family member to see him as well and you are in great hands if you choose to visit his office. If I could give 6 stars I would.<//text>

Friendly staff and Dr. was extremely friendly and explained things.  They worked well with my schedule and staff were up-front about costs.  They explained why they were doing tests and treatments and the benefits of everything.  The office was extremely clean and modern.  They moved efficiently through the appointment and it took exactly how long they quoted me, which was great since I scheduled multiple appointments in the same day.  I would highly recommend their office.  I did my research on their office and they have definitely earned the ratings they have received.< /text>

What a wonderful experience for allergy testing. I must first say I hadn’t had a good experience at another popular clinic in town. Not only is his staff super sweet and professional, his bedside manor is comfortable and patient. He allows you to ask questions and genuinely tries to simplify his explanations. I will recommend this doctor and office to anyone experiencing allergy or asthma issues because of my positive experience. I hadn’t realized I was struggling with my asthma, but they did. Simple tests and no long waits. Thank Family Allergy Clinic.</Text>

<review>I was able to get an appointment quickly.  My contact with the office has been wonderful.  I received the new patient paperwork via email, was checked in promptly when I arrived for my appointment.  I was brought back quickly, vitals were checked, and before I knew it Dr Buddiga was in for my appointment.  He listened to all my concerns, asked questions about my history and made a plan to go forward.  I appreciate feeling cared for and actually seeing a doctor that cared.  Thank you!</review>< Pics>

<Review>Dr.Buddiga has diagnosed my son correctly and is extremely thorough in his work up , I have been to many allergists locally and my son has not been evaluated by a physician - what I  mean to say is on their first evaluation of my son's condition they are evaluated by the doctor's physician assistants or NP's even when the pediatrician requests an Asthma consultation from an Asthma specialist .
High recommendation for this doctor who has a great reception & medical assistant staff who are happy to be there.
I have been to many doctors for my own care over the years but the welcoming atmosphere and team work that I have observed is definitely a plus - especially in these times of COVID19.<//Review><user_id>108162100228293002130< /user_id><time>1590988195896</time><name>Jeff Howard</name></record>

<review>I cannot say enough good things about Dr. Buddiga. My daughter has severe food allergies and had a scary weekend. Today, of course on the holiday, he spoke with me through his exchange (many doctors do not even have an exchange anymore, requiring patients to call 911 and follow up with them on the next business day), then he followed up with me several times by phone directly to make sure that my daughter had a course of treatment and would be OK before his office even reopens tomorrow. He will check her in person tomorrow before school starts. Who does that? In my daughter's case, he gave me all of options and explained everything in great detail. I am so deeply grateful for his expertise and all of the time and personal attention that he gives his patients. Truly an extraordinary doctor. Highly recommended.</review><user>107278563489092047218<//user>< date>

It was nice and cool when I walked in and the receptionist knew my name. They checked me in and I didn’t have to wait long. The nurse called me to the back, took my vitals and explained what she was in going to do. I  appreciated her communication and the promptness of the doctor. He had a pleasant mannerism that made me feel comfortable and important. Usually, a doctor will try to come in and rush out. However, I feel like he listened and did his best to tent to my problem. I would recommend this clinic to others who suffer from allergies. I never knew what I was allergic to until now. Before, I constantly itched....</Text>

Dr. Buddiga and his staff are very friendly and accommodating. I had a severe allergic reaction and was able to book an appointment that same day. Dr. Buddiga has great bedside manner -- he took the time to listen to my concerns and addressed them well. During my visit, I also took an allergy test that took about 20 minutes. I was given my results on the spot.
Overall, I was very impressed with the doctor and his staff. 10/10 would recommend.</Text>

I'm very impressed with the professionalism/kindness that this office provided me during a time when I was not feeling well. I'm thankful for the extra steps that this office took to making sure I was doing better and the icing on the cake was when Dr. Buddiga called me at home to check on me.

Today's visit was for the1st allergy shot of many to come. The Doctor not only administered the injections,  but went out of his way to explain the process as it relates to my overall health goals. He was quite affable and more than willing to share the biochemical processes involved in the allergy injection treatment regimen I have begun.
The staff are top notch. Efficient and personable. This place is being run by folks who care.< /text>

Dr. Buddiga is an exception doctor! About 2 years ago I started seeing him when my primary doctor could not longer help me with the symptoms I was having (coughing and inflammation of lungs  due to allergies). Nonetheless I came to his office after reading his review online and they couldn’t have been farther from the truth. Dr. Buddiga’s staff greeted me and he listened to my concerns very closely. About a week later I saw a change in my health and my cough eventually went away. I would HIGHLY recommend him!</text>

My husband and I just got vaccinated with Dr Buddiga. We received the Pfizer vaccine but I think he has both types. The office is very professional and friendly. It was nice to be able to ask the Dr questions and he administered the shot himself. Completely painless and relaxed. I felt safe and well cared for! The staff are amazing and helpful. Overall a great experience.<//text>

Lisa has a cheery hello and bright smile 24/7. Dr. Buddiga has a wealth of knowledge as well as a sincere desire to serve all his patients to the best of his abilities. This doctor has gone the extra mile for myself and my family. Having to get 2 shots every week for a year might seem overwhelming , but not if Jen is giving the injections. She always takes the time to make it as painless as possible. Thank you Family Allergy.

<text>Dr Buddiga was awesome. Found Family Allergy Asthma Clinic by Google. Front desk staff was great. I called in the morning and by four that afternoon I was on the road to recovery and no more itching. I had a severe rash and breathing problem that started the day after Christmas. My general practitioner had attempted treatment. Thank You Valley Allergy Asthma Clinic for helping me breathe better and no itching.</text><user>105010650015439056177<//user><date>1551394349480<//date><gmapID>0x80945cd769b28eed:0xb603afcf33e9c92<//gmapID>< response>

Dr Buddiga is very knowledgeable and knows how to share that sometimes complex medical knowledge in a way I can understand. He has helped me understand the reasons behind why I get asthma/allergy flare-ups which then helps me manage my own health more effectively. He listens patiently and never makes me feel rushed during appts. He is also very personable and does not have a heavy accent which makes communication easy. I respect him immensely and continue to e grateful for his expertise and help, it has made a difference in improving my health.

Lastly, the office staff are very helpful - prompt to answer the phone, explain billing, offer scheduling options, return phone calls, etc. Whether in person or on the phone, I never feel like I’m a bother but rather valued and respected. In general, Family Allergy Asthma offers professional and compassionate healthcare; a unique and rare combination. Give them a call, you won’t regret it!!<//review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

I am so glad I went to Family Allergy Asthma Clinic. The staff are very nice. Dr. Buddiga is very nice and a knowledgeable person. I have had a bad reaction to multiple antibiotics in the past and the doctors no longer knew how to treat me medically. I went to see Dr. Buddiga, he ran some tests and found out that I am not in fact allergic to the medications. Thankfully, I am now able to get the treatment I need.</review>

Dr. Buddiga and his staff provide excellent medical care and genuinely care about their patients.   Dr. Buddiga makes a point to thoroughly explain his treatment plan and welcomes any questions or concerns.  There has been little to no wait time for appointments and their allergy shot schedule is very convenient. If you or your family suffer from asthma or allergies this is the place to go.</text>

Best experience with a doctor I have had in years. As soon as i arrived for my 1st appiontment I was greeted by staff, helped immediately, and within 10 minutes escorted to a room. Dr Buddiga took his time explaining what would happen, and after the tests led me through the results. I am very pleased he will be handling my care as I go through treatment for my allergies.< /review>

<review>I'm allergic to waiting in doctor's offices.  I'm happy to say I had no allergic reaction to the wait time.  I was seen in a reasonable amount of time.  Unexpectedly, I received more time with the doctor than I'm accustomed at other offices.  The staff is friendly and efficient.  I give Family Allergy Asthma Clinic doctor and staff five stars.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>{'time': 1523424687103, 'text': 'Our team at Family Allergy Asthma Clinic values your candid feedback.

Fresno- who can avoid allergy treatment- I found an excellent friend in Dr Praveen.  Allergic items were identified and treated. I could start taking some items that I was avoiding before. Excellent follow up and individual attention by the doctor and his office staff. Hassle free appointment.Nice office set up as well.< /review>

I’ve struggled with allergies my entire life and have tried many different allergy doctors in the Fresno/Clovis area in the passed 10+ years, but Family Allergy Asthma Clinic has been the best fit for me. Dr. Buddiga is very thorough and takes time to listen and respond to all your questions and concerns. There’s rarely ever a long wait to be seen by the doctor or get your allergy shot. The staff is also very friendly and the office is always kept nice and clean. I highly recommend this place for all your allergy/asthma needs!<//text>

Dr. Buddiga is nothing short of amazing. He has a reassuring presence, which is very calming. He takes his time to explain everything thoroughly to ensure there is a full understanding of what is going on and what can be expected. Not once during any of my visits did I ever feel rushed by the doctor or any of his staff. The wait times have consistently been short and the staff is always friendly. Fresno is lucky to have to have Dr. Buddiga and his team as part of the community.<//text>

<Review>Family Allergy Asthma Clinic is the most friendly and helpful office I have been to in years!  Dr. Buddiga, himself, is a very caring man, and the staff are always polite and respectful. Dr. Buddiga takes his time in the room to truly understand your needs, and does not make you feel like he is in a rush when you ask questions. His office is one of the very few in Fresno that really make you feel welcome, and like they honestly care about their patients. I would highly recommend Family Allergy Asthma Clinic to family, friends, and anyone looking to find an office that cares about the health of their patients. I would give 10 stars if I could.</Review>< Pics>

Dr. Buddiga is amazing with my 6.5 yr old son. We came from another specialist who worked well with our son and he closed his practice and went with Baz. However, we weren’t able to stay with him, we were sent by our insurance to another provider with Baz. I was definitely not satisfied so I stopped taking my son until I could find another Specialist. That’s when our insurance sent us here! He has been very easy going and kind to my son, his staff is also always very welcoming. They’re very personable as well. Extremely satisfied and have already been telling family and friends to come here if they’re looking for an allergy specialist.<//Text>

<Rating>2</Rating><review>I have many allergies, and I thought that if I scheduled an appointment with a specialist, he or she could help find a solution to control my allergies, I went in last week for my appointment I was seen, I took the test and I only came out positive for two things on the list of 80, and I know for a fact that I’m allergic to more that half on that list, I also know this because I’ve gotten blood drawn, proving that I am allergic to the things that came out negative in the allergy test that I took here. The Doctor seemed a bit uninterested in my case and heard a discussion outside with the nurse prior to the test saying that they were not going to be able to run a test for me. It makes me think as if he had made that decision at first with the nurse maybe because I’m a CalViva patient. I didn’t feel taken seriously, and to me this is serious because when the spring comes along, it gets to the point where the allergy’s are so bad that you just want to stop breathing. Aside from me not being able to eat healthy, because I suddenly became allergic to fruits and vegetables.
I am editing this post as well because the doctor in a way made me review his page and watched me review it.</review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

<review>These people are wonderful! From the Doctor himself to the staff, everyone is so welcoming and personable. When I first came I was dealing with allergic reactions left and right, I had been to a plethora of doctors and none had been able to end the reactions. One visit here and Dr. Budiga immediately told me what was wrong and how we would fix it.
I come weekly now for allergy shots, and thoroughly enjoy the friendly disposition of receptionists and how much better I feel.< /review><Name>Nick Nick<//Name>< Pics>

<review>Nothing but positive things to say. This dude is AWESOME.

I specifically requested a referral to Dr. Buddiga because I'd read about his research and activism regarding pollution in the Central Valley and how it impacts the people who live here. He seemed like a doctor who truly cares about his patients, so I asked to see him before anyone else. Unlike most quality doctors in this town, he accepts my low-income insurance, and I was approved much more quickly than most specialist referrals. They called me and offered an appointment within less than a week of the phone call!

Office staff is very friendly, helpful, and fast. Very efficient and up-to-date. Dr. Buddiga is kind and patient, will answer all of your questions, and respects your time. He'll listen to whatever you have to say and proceed with whatever works for you as an individual.

My first appointment was quick, I was seen immediately and within minutes I was given a food allergy test. When the results were all negative he ordered blood work, and offered me an environmental allergy test just a week later. When I got that test, I lit up like a Christmas tree. He discussed with me the option of immunotherapy shots, fully transparent about the commitment it requires, and said we'd only proceed once I was ready. In the meantime he told me which OTC allergy meds would best supplement my current treatment. He scheduled an appointment in a few months, and said to call and make one sooner if I was ready before then.

I've had a lot of horrible experiences with doctors in this town, especially suffering from chronic illnesses and low income. Dr. Buddiga is every exception. I've already recommended him to several people and will continue to do so. I look forward to working with him in the future. You know a doctor is special when you actually get excited about your appointments!< /review><Name>Anais Fryer< /Name>< Rate>

Amazing Doctor! He's patient, kind, and accommodation. After having ongoing gastro issues I decided to see an allergist.  After testing was completed he thoroughly explained my allergies and came up with a plan and followed up with me to see how things were going. He truly cares and takes the time to sit with you. Not only that, he referred me to another doctor for a different issues that my PCP did not catch.  Amazing doctor!</text>

My Dermatologist referred me to Dr. Buddiga,a popular highly regarded Allergist, in town.
I had never been to an Allergist before,and I was unsure as to what would happen. I called and was able to get an appointment in a very timely manner.The friendly staff,was welcoming and accommodating and worked with me to find a date/time that met my schedule.
Dr. Buddiga,gave me plenty of time at the appointment.
He listened carefully as I answered his questions about my condition. He clearly explained the plan for testing and answered all my questions,never rushing me.
It was a pleasure to be in the caring environment of this office,with such attentive staff !
From the friendly front desk staff,Susie and Dale, to Denise, his assistant and finally to Dr Buddiga- himself.
It was an excellent experience all round.
I highly recommend this physician to any friends and family.<//Text>

I have been seeing Dr Buddiga for many years. So glad that he has his own practice now. The office staff are friendly and make it a breeze to schedule an appointment. The back office staff are always welcoming and professional. Dr Buddiga always explains things and takes time to answer questions. I highly recommend him for anyone in need of an allergist in Fresno/Clovis area.< /review>

<review>I highly recommend The Family Allergy and Asthma Clinic to anyone who is looking for an allergist. Dr. Buddiga is an amazing doctor who truly cares about the health of his patients. Not only has Dr. Buddiga helped to diagnose and treat my allergies, but has also shown an honest concern about other health issues I have faced during my time as a patient at his office. Also, the entire staff at this office go out of their way to make their patients feel comfortable and welcome during each and every visit. I cannot say enough good things about this business!< /review>< pictures>

This clinic is my sanctuary during the busy work week. Dr. Buddiga and his kind staff are so wonderful and on-point. The clinic itself is very modern and streamlined. Most importantly- I’m much healthier now that I’ve identified my allergies and am receiving weekly shots. My immune system is much stronger and I’ve avoided getting sick during this terrible winter season of circulating illness, despite my frequent plane travel which usually does me in! Thank you!</review>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Text>I feel like I've suffered from seasonal allergies all my life. This is the self-diagnosed opinion I’m led to believe based on the countless allergy medication commercials I’ve seen. Sadly, as I write this review, I realize that I truly “suffered” most of my time here in Fresno. I’ve suffered from the semi-annual sinus infections, suffered from mind-numbing head congestion, suffered from compromised immunity leading to regular cough/cold/flus, and suffered from not really knowing if latest over the counter med is the one I should be taking.
My allergies always come and go. I knew I would eventually get better and figured I could manage the symptoms as needed.  Finally, I had enough when I couldn’t “manage” things anymore.  I heard good things about Dr. Buddiga and took a chance to see if I could be seen at the clinic as a new patient. I was pleasantly surprised that they could see me the same day which they said was not typical. They emailed me my new patient paperwork which saved me (and presumably them) all that time getting to the clinic early.
The office is super convenient to get to being just off Chestnut and Herndon. At the clinic, I didn’t have to wait any time at all before going inside and having my vitals checked. A minute later, Dr. Buddiga came in and saw me which was unexpected since I usually have to wait seemingly forever before seeing most doctors.  I was pleased to get a thorough workup including the scratch test.  Dr. Buddiga and the clinic staff were very pleasant and I didn’t feel rushed or ever having to wait forever between procedures or reviewing the results with the doctor.
I’m very happy to be treated at the Family Allergy Asthma Clinic.  Of course, I still have to see what happens with my allergies but at least I have a solid treatment plan now.  My only regret is that I waited so long to come in.<//Text>< Pictures>

Amazing friendly staff who always welcome you with a smile and an exceptionally well educated doctor working to bring you the best quality of care. I first came in regarding my severe ashma, after being seen by doctor after doctor who just threw different prescriptions at me then sent me on my way. But here Dr. Buddiga gave me the time of day, and fought for the treatment I needed over a six month period, that’s dedication right there. Coming here has 100% improved my quality of life and I couldn’t be happier.< /Text>

Nice staff.  Nice office. Nice doctor.  After my first visit with Dr. Buddiga I felt so much better and everyday that goes by I feel even better. I already recommended Dr. Buddiga to my sister.  When friends and family ask me how I'm doing?,   I say " A whole lot better!"< /review>

<text>Dr Buddiga was able to get me in quickly when I began to have wheezing/coughing.  First time I have had Asthma and was so relieved that he understood what I needed.  He and his staff were knowledgable and friendly.  Beautiful office with an easy location. I have referred many friends and family who are experiencing allergy and respiratory problems to this office.  Living in the Central Valley, at one time or another, we are going to have allergy issues; it's good to  have such an experienced, pleasant allergist available.< /text><rate>5</rate>< pictures>

Family Allergy Clinic on Herndon and Chestnut is a wonderful answer to my lifelong chronic allergies. Dr. Buddiga is extremely knowledgable, professional, and caring. The staff is very friendly and help you feel welcomed and comfortable. They have a have a very efficient, clean, welcoming office. I have suffered with allergies all of my life. Why have I not done this sooner?! Dr. Buddiga is a comfortable and caring doctor who helps
Patients like me to heal my allergies. I am so grateful that I took this long overdue step to see this Allergy Specialist. I drive from Tulare for this appointment. I highly recommend adults grandparents or children to seek professional treatment and begin healing from allergies. I feel very confident and happy to be a patient here with Dr. Buddiga at Family Allergy Clinic in Fresno. I highly recommend this  physician and his practice, Susan Warren< /review>

Dr. Praveen Buddiga and his staff are friendly, thorough, and efficient. The office is clean and comfortable, and the wait times are extremely short. But most importantly, Dr. Buddiga is focused on the health and well-being of his patients. He listens to the concerns of his patients and answers any and all questions. His warm and personable demeanor is refreshing and it makes being a patient at Family Allergy and Asthma Clinic enjoyable.<//review>

I have experienced allergy issues since the early 1980's and have seen a variety of doctors over the years. My symptoms have ranged from severe sinus inflammation, sinus infections, bronchitis, to asthma. I have been over treated, meaning I have been given too much medication, that negatively effected my daily routine and other doctors have been too conservative where my symptoms improved little. I was sufficiently frustrated at one point where I gave up on doctors and went solely  with homeopathic treatments. During the past two years my symptoms became persistent and I was unable to find relief.  Last year, in October,  I was referred by my new primary care physician to Dr. Buddiga and have been extremely pleased with his thoroughness, his approach and the results! I feel better than I have in the past 10 years.  His bed side manner is great. He is friendly and approachable and his office staff is great. I can highly recommend a visit to Dr. Buddiga.<//Text>

My youngest daughter has struggled with asthma; especially,here in the valley (plume in the air at times is when my daughter has the toughest hardship).  Thanks to Family Allergy, my daughter's health condition improved.  She  is interested in sport in her middle school.  With no hesitation, I recommend Dr. Praveen Buddiga.

My wife and I have seen huge improvements in our daughter's respiratory abilities during challenging poor air for sensitive groups.  This April 2019, Izel  will complete a year of treatment and keeps depending less of specific medical intervention.  She doesn't allow health issues hinder sports decisions.< /text>

I was recently referred to doctor Budigga for a cough I could not get rid of after recent State wildfires. I was so happy to find such an awesome specialist who genuinely cares about his patients. All my life I have been accustomed to waiting long durations to be seen and be rushed through a visit with really no results. Finally I was able to find a great primary doctor who referred me to Family Allergy Asthma Clinic where Dr. Budigga has treated me like a family member or close friend. I am very grateful to him and his staff for being so thorough in helping me to get rid of what became such a nuisance cough.  If I could give Dr. Buddiga and his staff more than five stars I would 😊</review>

Read on for my experience: I have struggled with asthma and allergies since I was a kid.  I have seen specialist before and have received little help so I wasnt sure anyone could help me.  After a visit to the ER I looked for another specialist to try again. Fro. My first phone call the office staff was warm welcoming and got me right in.  When I met Dr. Buddiga he was so easy to talk to and with so many years of experienced knowledge and the research he has done.  He was the first doctor that actually was able to answer questions I have had for years, and noone else was able to explain them to me so I could understand it.  Also he was the first doctor that ever ordered blood work in 30+ years of having these issues. He put together a plan to get the asthma under control, because breathing is important, and then we will move on to the allergies.  For the first time in a very long time that I am hopeful that I can get this under control because I am a very physically active person and asthma creates a lot of struggle for me to overcome.  But I truly look forward to getting my life back and being healthier.  Thanks to Dr. Buddiga and his great office staff.< /Text>

I absolutely am very grateful And thrilled with the type of service you receive from Dr. Buddiga and staff at Family Allergy and Asthma Clinic.  My daughter and son have been suffering with allergy, asthma and eczema symptoms for years.   They have seen different specialist and other allergist And still did not  Make any progress. Finally my pediatrician referred me to Dr. Buddiga.  And it's been the best thing that's ever happened for my children!!  Doctor  Is very knowledgeable in his field And takes his time to explain conditions and the different method of  Treatments, why they're necessary, how they work and what type of end result you will be looking at.   My only regret is that I wish I would have known of him sooner!  It is a little disheartening and frustrating to know that the issues my children have been struggling with could have been resolved years of go. But the silver lining is knowing that now they are in the care of Dr. Buddiga and everyone at Family Allergy and Asthma we are on the right path of treatment and resolution!! Thank you to Family Allergy and Asthma.......< /Review>

<review>I can not say enough great things about Dr. Buddiga and his staff! I have Celiac Disease and multiple food, environmental and prescription allergies. Dr.Buddiga always addresses any changes or concerns with my health. He is exceptionally knowledgeable and explains everything in a way that I understand and I never feel rushed .  Dr.Buddiga and his staff are always happy and my appointments have always been on time or early! For the first time in my life, I finally have found an allergist that has helped me  stop suffering! Thank you, for everything you and your staff do.

Dr. Buddiga is patient, kind and a truly exceptional allergist.  He is a great doctor that understands how diagnoses translate into everyday life. Our littles have severe food allergies. We have been to allergists in San Diego, then again at Choc in Orange County before coming to Dr. Buddiga here in Fresno. We are so happy to have found this office.  I think his personal experience with allergies is what sets him apart and makes him truly outstanding.  I have a background in research, am incredibly picky and have very high expectations from medical professionals, and especially for those caring for my children. Dr. Buddiga far exceeds my expectations in the very best of ways. The office is also beautiful and easy to access. Very minimal wait time. The office staff is very friendly too.<//text>

Sadly, I have chronic sinus infections. The only MD ever who has dramatically helped me with incredible patient care is Dr. Budigga. For example, one time I was experiencing a high level of symptoms. It was Saturday morning on a holiday weekend. Dr. Budigga's answering service took my call, put me on hold and within minutes I was talking with Dr. Budigga. He left his activities and opened his office to see me. He prescribe appropriate Rx and I was on my way to healing before noon on that holiday weekend Saturday. He is the best, most up-to-date, most conscientious, most well-trained allergist/asthma expert in the Valley!< /review>

I have suffered with asthma for 41 years as a child I went to various physicians of multiple disciplines from pediatric to allergist, but never was I under constant care or control and most of all I really didn’t understand  my illness until I seen Dr Buddiga. He put my asthma under control he educated me about my illness and put me under a regiment of medications. He stated when he first seen me I was moving very little air in my lungs. I have my good days and I have my bad days but I have more good days now, and he is able to see the improvement in my lung capacity. If it wasn’t for Dr Buddiga my quality of life due to my asthma would not have improved and I honestly believe that I wouldn’t be alive today. He actually cares for his patients and it is difficult to find a Dr that actually cares for his patients.</text>

<Text>I've had the pleasure of knowing Doctor Buddiga for some years now. Ive seen him at another office that he use to work at.  In my experience with him is that he takes time with his patients, he is concerned about your health issues and make sure he adresses them. He is up close and personal. Almost a person you can call a friend because he is so down to earth and professional at the same time. I had not seen him for some years, but when I seen him on a Tv commercial  I immediately picked up the phone and made an appointment, and I'm glad I did.

His office was able to get me an appointment in a timely manner and the whole process from checking in to checking out was streamlined and convenient.

< review>
It’s very hard to find and keep good doctors in the Fresno Area in part due to the lower rate insurance companies reimburse doctors in this area.  When I learned I could google a message to let others know about Dr. Buddiga and his office, Family Allergy and Asthma Clinic, I was glad to share.

Dr.Buddiga is a good listener.  I know this as I have asked him many questions during my appointments.  If you are looking for a good doctor who knows first hand the struggles of those who have allergies, asthma, sinus problems or are in need of immunotherapy, Dr. Buddiga understands and can help patients on their pathway to improved health.
Good doctor
Good staff
Clean office
Good location

Sincerely,
Joanne<//review>

< Review>
The staff at Family Allergy Clinic are very professional yet caring. All members of my family go here, and it's nice to finally have answers to the questions we have regarding our allergy and asthma symptoms. Dr. Buddiga is great with children. He's seen my daughter since she was about 3 months old, helping determine lactose problems, allergy screening, and asthma concerns. When she turns two, we will be returning to Dr. Buddiga for a screening of possible food allergies. He even knows how to handle explaining things to my stubborn husband, who does not like to go to the doctor, but will go to see Dr. Buddiga and get treated for his ever troubling sinus issues. Overall, this is a great family allergy and asthma clinic, where you get the care you need, and it's comfortable and clean. I hope you give Dr. Buddiga and his staff a chance to care for your family as I have. You won't regret the decision to be a patient at Family Allergy and Asthma Clinic!<//Review>
