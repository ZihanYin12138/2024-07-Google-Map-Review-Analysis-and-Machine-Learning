<Text>Senergy has done work for me for at least 10 years.  I have used them for my business, my rentals and my primary residence.  They have always done a high quality job and I trust their recommendations.   They do all the maintenance on my HVAC units and have done installations for me over the years. I highly recommend Senergy.<//Text><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None</resp>< gmap_id>

Anthony did a great job replacing my hot water heater and repairing an older valve for my refrigerator water line. He was fast, efficient and he did quality work. I recommend this company. Anthony has done other repairs at my house in the past the thought is the same. Great job! Thank you!</Text>

Everything went extremely smooth!  He was on time which is a huge deal for me!   Waiting around for someone that doesn’t value your time is so frustrating!  Anthony was professional and explained all the details about what when wrong and even provided me with information for future cost saving changes I was interested in!   So happy that I used this company!  If you value  great customer service, this is the company you should use!!!</Text>

Our AC quit working unexpectedly as we were preparing for a new tenant to move into our rental property. Senergy was able to come out the next day, showed up on time and fixed the problem quickly. This is the second time we’ve used Senergy and we highly recommend them!<//Text>

<review>They wanted 1200 to fix my furnace by replacing the gas valve and ignitor.
So I called for a 2nd opinion. And sure enough, the gas valve was turned off, and the ignitor was the only thing to be replaced. The 2nd opinion party charged us only 250 to replace the ignitor. Senergy was asking for an arm and a leg.

My question to synergy is why they would want to charge me to replace the right working gas valve?

They want your money. I suggest asking for other 2nd opinions. The other party was helpful, honest, and the price reasonable.< /review><user>109358145598994802744</user>< GmapID>

{'time': 1606088330610, 'text': 'Hey Mike sorry you had a bad experience and this is obviously a misunderstanding, but we originally came out to diagnose your furnace that was not heating. We diagnosed a sticking gas valve and broken hot surface igniter. You were not present at the time of service so we tried explaining everything to your wife but she was in and out of the house because she was on a phone call. We did turn the gas valve off because it is not safe to let your furnace try to light with no igniter and a sticking gas valve, it would just continue to feed gas inside the furnace. We would’ve unplugged the furnace but we’ve been having some hot days too so we didn’t want to restrict you from using air conditioner. Your system is around 30 years old we originally recommend replacing the whole system and we even made special arrangements with you to help you get this taken care of because you said you didn’t have the money upfront I thought we were doing above and beyond work for you I’m sorry you don’t see it that way. If you would’ve just called i could’ve explained this to you in detail.'}<//resp>

I am enrolled in their maintenance program and I couldn't have asked for better. The price is totally reasonable, trust me I checked around. Bi-annual visits and I know exactly what was checked and its condition . Then you get the pictures and a plan sent right after the visit. Senergy staff is friendly and responsive and works with you when things inevitably come up. Totally recommended for you and your family.</Review>

Anthony was knowledgeable, professional and punctual.  He clearly explained the issues as a result of the initial, incorrect installation of my unit in 2017 (that was provided by a company who has since gone out of business) and what repairs needed to occur in order to ensure my system worked properly and to stop it from malfunctioning.  His team was able to offer me a temporary solution that cooled my home until I could save up enough to pay the main scope of work that needed to happen in order to completely fix the problem. His pricing was fair and I am fully satisfied with his service.  I would highly recommend Synergy!<//review>

Anthony from Senergy Plumbing and Heating showed up on time wearing a face mask ready to inspect my system since it had been over a year since I had had it serviced. He replaced a capacitor and helped me and my wife and  sync or system on Nest.  I will continue to have Senergy Plumbing Heating & Air inspect and maintain my system in the future.  Very professional.</Text>

<review>In 2018, I used Senergy after two previous A/C companies failed to fix my A/C problem.   Anthony got it right, and I have not had problems since.   This year, I contacted Anthony (Senergy) for a home purchase inspection.   I was impressed by his knowledge.   At immediate sight, he was able to give me pertinent facts about this particular A/C system, in addition that it was a recalled model.     Additionally, his quote to install a new system was reasonable.    I intend to continue using Senergy because of his knowledge, competence, and reasonable pricing to remedy situations.<//review><Time>1573588299951< /Time><gmapID>0x80dcb4f491e11535:0x6b26efd63d1d302<//gmapID></record>

I had Anthony stop by for an estimate which he did at the day/time he offered. According to my wife, who was at home for the appointment, he seemed and sounded friendly and knowledgeable; however, since we were interviewing several contractors, we eventually selected another one for our project. We, of course, are very appreciative of his time and effort.< /text>

<Text>We have had Anthony out a few times to our home and we couldn’t be happier with the service he provides. He is thorough and knowledgeable about the problems we have come across. Other companies have wanted to just do a quick fix to get us through the summer months but Anthony took his time and found that we have had a leak in the system and that’s the reason we have to call someone out each year. I would recommend his service to anyone and would have him/ his company back whenever I may need it. I totally trust this company with my AC service.</Text></record>

He scheduled me just a day out and serviced my unit in about 30 minutes. He did not try to sell me anything and just recommended that I hose out my unit twice a year to keep it clean so it would run more efficiently. Everything works great now, and it only cost me the service call. Thanks Anthony!</Review>< pics>

Anthony and his team always pull of a job well done. Their service is always quick and efficient, even if it’s just your maintenance on your AC/Heater due. Thanks Anthony!<//review>

Anthony came out and was very informative not only about A/C but about water Heater and Furnace.  Got my AC up and running in about 20 min. I signed up for their home service plan which will pay for itself I am sure. Local and Honest Business I Support.<//text>

Another service today on my mom's house.
This company never disappoints. We now use them for our annual preventive maint services.

2020
Another service today - super professional, extremely responsive, reasonable rates - overall capable service provider!

2019
By far the best customer service organization I have dealt with in years.  They are extremely customer oriented, professional, timely and honest!  Winter (Customer Service Manager) is the best!!!!  And the technician was so helpful, fast and capable!!!!!
We liked them so much we signed up for their preventive maintenance program!!! Excellent 5+<//Text>

I am not one to leave many reviews, but I must say that Anthony, hands down, is best in his business. He is honest, hard-working, smart, and listens to his client's concerns to ascertain their specific needs and budget. Not only has Senergy Heating & Air performed maintenance and repairs to my personal home and office, but I have confidently referred Senergy to both family and clients (which again, is rare for me}. Give Anthony a call, and you'll see what true customer care is all about.</Text>

It was a pleasure having them work on my units. I have never seen such quality of work and such gentleman. I'm elderly and somewhat disabled and and I need it my air due to medical conditions I get sick in the heat. I couldn't get anyone to come. But they were here as soon as I got a hold of them awesome people thank you. God bless you Anthony< /Review>

I contacted Anthony regarding installing an air scrubber unit at my residence for my A/C - Heating unit.  He scheduled me accordingly and Gabriel performed the installation.  Gabriel performed an excellent job ensuring all pieces were installed correctly and in working order.  He was very meticulous in ensuring the job was done to perfection.  Gabriel and Senergy should be commended for their outstanding service and workmanship.<//review>

Anthony was excellent at helping me with my air conditioner when I had previously had several other companies out to my house and the issue was not solved by them.   Anthony quickly found the problem and fixed it.  That was 2-3 years ago and my air conditioner is still working like a charm.  Plus he installed some other equipment that helped my air conditioner run more efficiently.   Highly recommend Senergy</text>

Senergy has been terrific to and for us.
We needed a new system,  which we had known for a while,  but then it just quit. Of course that happened during a very long heat wave. Even though it was an extremely busy time for Senergy,  they came out and did everything for us. Their prices are more than competitive,  and the workmanship was done with dedication . Each technician was professional and they cleaned up after the work was completed.</text>

I had Anthony come out and diagnose my house solar hot water system and found him to be very knowledgeable and thorough, he even looked into my HVAC system since this is an older house. Great service, I definitely would recommend Senergy Plumbing Heating & Air.<//Review>

<text>We have a home warranty plan but they would not simply inspect our duct work for possible rodent damage.  Anthony was willing at a fair price.  Anthony was detained too far away to make it the same day, so he sent Devon.  Devon arrived on time, after a long day, at 630pm.  Devon is pretty young but very polite, personable,  courteous,  thorough,  cautious knowledgeable, honest  and professional , able to explain possible issues and investigate each possibility,  for our extremely old system  (pulley system on fan motor and thermostats from maybe the 70s.  After two trips into the attic, once with the sysyem off, then on, Devon was able to determine no damage to the  duct work.  Therefore there would be no rodent debris IN the ducts...therefore no need to pay hundreds to clean ducts. Although duct inspection was the reason to call,  Devon fixed a fan that would not turn off when system was turned off at no additional cost.  Poor guy was on his way to his last call with a great attitude at 730.
I would not only recommend Senergy, but Anthony and Devon as well.  Tragic Senergy does not have a contract with our home warranty company.</text><username>Jodi Lass<//username><Time>1498711585823< /Time>< Rating>

I was also satisfied with the parts that was changed out or added to boost up my AC. I Highly recommend their Services to others. God Bless Senergy!<//text>

<text>Anthony at Senergy is a life saver. My heater went out and it’s freezing cold.I called the office to make an appointment, well I ended up getting Anthony who answered the phone. He was very sympathetic to my problem and put me on his schedule same day. When Anthony showed up he explained in full detail what the issue was, how to avoid future problems  and fixed my heater same day. I would definitely recommend him to my friends and family.< /text><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

<Pics>None<//Pics><Review>Senergy is awesome honest knowledgeable and professional. After another company came to fix my in laws leaking AC it started to leak again a week later. Anthony sent a technician named Gabe and this young man really knows his job. He did a through inspection on the unit and determined the condensation drain was plugged. He fixed the unit and made sure everything was running fine. You would think the other guy would have been able to discover the problem. The other guy told my in laws if it leaked again they would need a new unit. Beware of others who want to upsell instead of repair. I recommend Anthony’s company SYNERGY TO BE TOUR FIRST AND ONLY CALL</Review>< Rate>

<review>I needed Senergy to come out and check my A/C.... Of course it stopped working during a heat wave!  Got online at 2AM Wednesday to make the next available appt which luckily was an arrival window today between 4-6PM (the next available was not until late Friday) I immediately received confirmation via text & email! Received additional confirmation at 8:30AM and a call at 4:45PM announcing ETA approx 15 min. Anthony Torres & Gabriel arrived  found the problems EXPLAINED and answered my questions. Immediately, replaced the parts, which resolved the issues... And left me chillin' in wonderful A/C by 5:30!< /review><username>Evie Vilkin</username><userid>106625528743175205827</userid><gmap_id>0x80dcb4f491e11535:0x6b26efd63d1d302</gmap_id>< time>

< Review>
Update:

The real problem was my home warranty company, Anthony has been great at dealing with their incompetence. Thank you Senergy for helping resolve this bad experience with first american warranty
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Terrible. They sent a guy to the wrong address, first American warranty had sent them to my address. So my appointment was a waste of time. Spent the whole day waiting. Then to make it up to me they allegedly waive the $75  copay. The technician made it clear his company doesn't like to do business with first american warranty. They take my filter out and didn't replace it.

Then when they come around replacing it, a leak starts in the evaporator and they refer the problem out to another company because they don't want to deal with first american. I got an invoice for $0 as proof that the copay was settled. Yet first American now is claiming I need to pay the $75 to senergy. My account has been sent to collections. This whole experience with senergy and home warranty has been a disaster. Senergy if you can help me resolve this I will remove this true story. The invoice you sent didn't help.

Update 0400 1/17/19: Spoke to Anthony and he said he'd make a call to my home warranty company to clarify the mix up. Will post again once there's a resolution. Thanks for the quick response Anthony.<//Review>

<text>I had contacted senergy for my work maintence. I could notice right away that they where very professional and very intentive to my questions. We needed a few units services for our veterinary clinic out in Murrieta. After scheduling the maintenance  the CSR Alexis took the time to call our property management and schedule it with the maintence guys to get room access. When the technicians arrived they where very kind and helpful they explained in detail alll that they did and even gave us a print for our property management office. I called to speak to the manager (owner I believe)after the job to let him know that they did more then a great job and spoke with anthony. He is very professional and really caring when it comes to his business. Thanks again senergy for the great work !</text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

We stopped for a quick lunch, sat on the patio with a view of the ocean. Good variety of choices at noon, even brunch items until 2:00pm. We had lobster tacos that were delicious and plentiful! Also shared a Santa Barbara burger served with sweet potato fries, really tasty.  Very polite and pleasant servers and staff, a nice experience all around!< /Text>

I've only has breakfast here, but very much enjoyed it. My only disappointment was how there wasn't any salsa to out on top of my omelette. The pancakes were nice and fluffy though, and overall the food was delicious. A great location right across from the pier, and really close to the funk zone. So, makes it a great first stop of your day if you plan on wine tasting.</text>

<review>From the time we walked into the restaurant the service was bad.  We waited 4 minutes before the hostess came to take our name. After we were seated we waited a long time to order from a rude and unfriendly waiter. We've been sitting here a while now and still waiting for the food. We may have to leave and go somewhere else. OK the food came... Nothing to write home about. The breakfast burrito was no good, even though we asked for no tomatoes on the hamburger they put tomatoes and NO 1000 island dressing. The harbor view breakfast had no salt on the potatoes or eggs and they brought the ham after I finished my breakfast. I wish I could've given them half a star. This place is really bad.< /review>< Date>

<Review>Extremely bad service. It was not busy when we came and there were four idle servers and several bus boys, and a hostess walking around, sitting down at tables pretending to do side work. We sat there for 15 minutes and no one came by and and all of the severs completely ignored us. We walked out after that. There are so many other restaurants in this area I am surprised they stay in business with such poor service.< /Review>< pictures>

Came here for lunch the other day with family we ordered tuna melt, ahi tuna salad, their house burger and their clam chowder. All of it was delicious very good portions and very flavorful food. The service was ok. Not as attentive as one would like but we survived.  Would I come here again? Yes.</Review>

<Text>I went to Eladios a a few years ago and swore i would never go back. The staff was terrible. I was about to bash the waitress that helped or didn't help us but this place turned it around. I phoned in and order and was in a hurry when the girl up front says ill call back when its ready. What a refreshing surprise. I ordered the club sandwich and it was incredible.< /Text>< Response>

Clam chowder was excellent! Fish and chips, with coleslaw and SWEET PATATO fries were awesome!! Service excellent! We asked for a side of broccoli and they gave us the option to sauté or steam  (no microwave), nice! Also, our daughter wanted the Spaghetti Bolognese off the adult menu instead of the Spaghetti off the kids menu. The chef was willing to do a half portion for us. Again, great service. It wasn't very crowded on Father's Day, because most of the crowds were on the pier across the street. We will come back again if in town again!</review>

<Name>Armin Ostojic</Name><review>(Translated by Google) You should bring a little time ... after all we are at the sea ... and on vacation;) but it is worth it! The calamari etc. were super tasty and the prices are absolutely ok! Our server was warm and very very friendly. Absolute recommendation! If some write here: eat good but service poor ... then they certainly didn't have our waiter ;-D So ...: Have a funny good dinner on Sant Barbara Beach!

Ein wenig Zeit sollte man mitbringen...wir sind ja schließlich am Meer...und im Urlaub ;) aber es lohnt sich! Die Calamari etc.. waren super lecker und die Preise sind absolut ok! Unser Kellner war herzlich und sehr sehr freundlich. Absolute Empfehlung! Wenn manche hier schreiben: essen gut aber Service schlecht...dann hatten sie bestimmt nicht unseren Kellner ;-D Also...: Have a funny good Dinner on Sant Barbara Beach!<//review>< pictures>

< Review>
Very nice and quiet park. It has a unique playground, benches, grills, a half court, and an open area of grass. Sometimes there are homeless. Park is kept fairly clean. There are no public restrooms however. It is connected with the Miner's Ravine trail so that is a plus for me whenever I am on a bike ride and am in need of water.<//Review>

Nice playground for the younger ones and a basketball half court for the older ones.  Shade trees, tables and BBQ grills.  Park connects to the false ravine trail.< /Review>

<Resp>None</Resp><review>Its just terrible. The park its self is great but around 12:00am till 6:00pm their are drugs being sold sometimes even at 8:00pm till 11:00pm. Its none stop. Their are even people in fancy cars comeing by and picking up drug dealers and droping them off at the park. The police in roseville suck btw since this has been going on since the park was build.no offense to any police/sheriffs reading this. But roseville is starting to have gangs i bet and no ones doing anything about it. We need cameras to watch the park.<//review>< Time>

Would give 0 stars if I could. My daughter was swinging and I was watching her and then some homeless drug addict looking man pulled up on his bike RIGHT behind her. Super unsafe. Please avoid at all costs.< /review>

I ordered #32, Seafood combo soup, and i changed the noodles to egg instead of vermicelli. It was the BEST Pho I've had... I'm from the Bay Area, and was surprised to find this place along my route to Yosemite. Their limonade is from fresh squeezed lemons, not a factory product. Also, you can sit inside, which is a big plus during these times!< /review>

This place is a gem. The grilled chicken spring rolls were the best I've had. The seasoning on the chicken complimented the freshness of the veggies and the wrapper had a just the right amount of chewing. The peanut sauce was perfect. I had the brisket and beef ball pho and I wouldn't change a thing.</review>

<Rating>5</Rating><review>Food here is LEGIT! Pho, just like ramen, is the perfect food after a day in the snow. On our way back from Dodge Ridge, we stopped here and were pleasantly surprised. The soup for the combination pho was so good (this is coming from a person who's very picky about pho), it was slightly sweet but didn't have any MSG flavor. It was also a great value, with lots of meat and tripes. My favorite was actually the spring roll. The freshly grilled pork had a great flavorful, perfect with Sriracha peanut sauce. I literally could not stop eating and even took half from my boyfriend :p the spicy chicken fried noodle was good too, nice wok flavor and pretty spicy. I'm not a big fan of pepper seeds in my food so if they had use fresh chili or powder, it would have been even better.

Thai iced tea is made fresh in the house, so you have to give it a try.

We came on a Sunday afternoon during off hours, and this place still had a few tables of customers, surprisingly. Service was good, food is even better!</review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOv-OWkDnQNyS9X1LHLjNUSzcRY-3y6YbNHj8I=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM7WhhYP_nNzv39YwyYdZFpMkTAC8XbSUzDU7Y=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures><Response>None<//Response><gmap_id>0x8090f82b0abf0ab3:0x188d0f87d47288ef</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Food is good!

Service by one of the servers was FABULOUS. Lady server (she had braces).

The guy server was horrible! The type of server that just shouldn't be serving. Asked for veggies, then when he came with that, I realized they forgot to give us water, so I asked whenever he had a chance, to bring the water. He replied, "you should have told me that before, when I was getting your vegetables."

Ummmmm. Ok. I asked when I ordered. But, I guess the gal who took our order didn't relay the message to him, so our water was not delivered until half way into the meal. And, I heard the guy server tell the lady server to get it, and so she did, in between dropping food off to other tables.

Not impressed by the male server.

So, if you go here with the intention that you might get subpar service, but yummy food, you'll like it here.

Pho soup base was great, but the cuts of meat was mostly cartilage.

I had a chicken, vegetable, noodle bowl. It's like a cold noodle salad. The flavor was great. Good portion for the price.

We still paid about $30 with tip which isn't horrible, we had 1 pho, 1 chicken/noodle bowl, gyoza appetizer, 1 Vietnamese iced coffee, and boba Thai iced tea.

Again the food was good, service is good if you get the nice server. 😆</Text>

Great customer service and great food. Very clean and the food came out quickly. The appetizers are priced really good as well. They have all of the good condiments at the table ready to go, which is nice.  This place is a neat little noodle house that does not skimp on the portions. This is a great alternative to fast food and you are guaranteed to be full afterwards.<//review>

Was looking for a spot to eat on our way back from Yosemite and chanced upon this.

The timings listed here is wrong as they can be open later - call ahead.

I'm used to good Pho from Bay Area. And this place was better than most of those.
Great yummy Pho! Meat was just perfect and tender. And the broth was awesome

Friendly and quick service

Highly recommend!<//Text>

We've gone here 3 times over past year and hoped we'd get something better each time.   Been to several Pho restaurants in the last 15 years in Sacramento and San Francisco. Love the Vietnamese menu..
We've finally given up on Oakdale Pho 38. Everything is the same sauce on meat accompanying vermicelli noodles.  Wontons were fried vs. steamed. Took off outer fried noodle to eat stuffing, yuck!
Do not recommend this restaurant.<//text>

Mrs S and I love Pho 38--best Pho in Oakdale (ok, just because it's the only Pho in Oakdale doesn't diminish the fact that it is the best Pho in town).  We'll meet here after work to get our Pho fix in.  Good food, prices and service.  We love it.  If you go, tell them the Pho King sent you.  They'll know who that is.< /text>

I always get the chef's special bowl. The most delicious Pho I've ever had. Their boba smoothies are good too. One of my favorite spots to eat.< /Review>

Slow service, otherwise food was good (about average for pho in this area). Spring rolls could have been fresher.</review>

This tree is actually larger than the Sherman tree if you include the branches, and older at 3200 years old. Magnificent tree. Avoid the crowds and take the congress trail< /text>

Look, it's a giant tree. It's not gonna pose for you, it's not gonna do a cute dance or make a cute face, it's just going to stand there and look pretty. If you're not impressed by nature then this isn't for you. I, however, an in awe when I see just how massive these trees are. Truly they're a thing of beauty and they dwarf anyone and anything that goes near them. I'm already short so I'm used to the feeling. If you're into feeling like a small child and you like looking at trees then this is the place for you.<//Review>

One of the largest sequoias, and thus trees on the planet, and perhaps the oldest living sequoia, with an age estimated at over 3,000 years, the President Tree is a stunning sight. This huge tree is easily accessible and well-worth the hike to see it.< /review>

Closed due to government shutdown even though note on the gate and the website said it’s open without services. There’s a cop guarding the road closure 12 miles from the tree. I drove six hours to get here! Get it together America!<//text>

<review>(Translated by Google) The oldest sequoia in the park ... 3240 years old ... impressive! The walk that leads to it (Congress trail) is very pleasant in a forest of sequoias and the other great sequoias that surround it worth a visit !!

<Review>I've been going here for several years now. I was originally referred here by 1800Dentist. I can't say enough good things about the staff and office. The entire staff is very attentive and accommodating. So far I've had 3 crowns completed and multiples cleanings. All my experiences have been positive with good results. I honestly feel that my dental health is the best it has been my entire life and I definitely owe it to Pearl Dental. I highly recommend them.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

Where has this Dentist been my whole life. From the most friendly receptionist, Gloria, to the extremely detailed technicians...they are all Great!
But, number one, is the the man with the gentle hands, Dr Camacho. I would recommend his hands to everyone. I am afraid of dentists... but NOT WITH HIM!
Thank you to the entire team at Pearl Dental!!<//Text>

Outstanding service by true professionals and a top-level facility, with digital imaging and great follow-up.
They helped me with dental onlay and tooth implant; perfect fit both times!  My check-ups are regular, thanks to email/text notifications.
Staff is awesome and Dentists are very experienced and careful when doing the work.
Love them!

Pearl Dental Group is the best place for your routine dental care! The staff is phenomenal! They are fast, friendly, and professional. They know your name when you come back and they always make you feel at home. The doctors are wonderful at answering any questions you have and taking the time to explain conditions, services and treatments.
Gloria... Dr. Sara... you ROCK!
I wouldn’t go anywhere else! Highly, highly recommended!<//Text>

She pulls up a stool and visits about what is going on in your life- before beginning the scheduled procedure. The rooms have lighted panels on the ceilings- with pictures of the outdoors that lend the rooms an airy feel. In this Pearl Dental office, the rooms are situated in a circle around a central open space. When you are waiting, there is  companionable activity going on around you.</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< date>

<Text>I have been a client of Dr. Trilles for over eight years. He came highly recommended from my sister-in-law and several others from my daughters private school in Glendora.

I have never experienced such a positive dental visit or a dentist as trustworthy, approachable, knowledgeable, well experienced and hands on as Dr. Erwin Trilles.  Not only does he have the fastest dental hands in the west ... he will NOT bombard you with a laundry list of unnecessary dental work to inflate costs.

At every visit I feel like a VIP client. I am greeted (by name) the moment I walk-in the office by the extraordinary, ray-of-sunshine, Gloria. The waiting room is decorated with cool calming and stylish decor ... and my favorite part - The Coffee Bar!

They are so efficient with scheduling ... by the time my coffee is brewed, the staff has called me to my dental “suite” (a private room) with a large TV screen and choice of Netflix programming.

This may be the most efficient Dental office and they work well as a team. They have several services from dental work, to teeth whitening to Orthodontic services. They respect your time ... they work swiftly, yet timely and are reasonably priced.

In emergency cases or when in need of troubleshooting ... they have worked with me to resolve the problem with ease.

If Dr. Trilles moves to the other side of the moon  ... I can ensure you ... I will follow him there! By far the best Dentist I’ve worked with!< /Text></record>

Love coming here! Everyone is just so accommodating and welcoming. Dr. Sara is so sweet and helpful. She cares about her patients and only recommends stuff that the patient actually needs. I never felt like I was rushed or whatsoever. Highly recommend this place.</Review>

From friendly staff to an amazing Doctor. We’ve been coming here for about 3 years and my 6 year old son & 4 year old daughter have never complained about visiting the dentist.
Overall great place to bring the whole family.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><Gmap_id>0x80c32fb75acb9e77:0x8e4ee12aabd357d</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

The care of my teeth has never been better. Dr. Sara is an exceptional dentist, who is never short with time or attention. I also appreciate the care provided by Nancy who has cleaned my teeth many times. Gloria is a pleasure to work with and always provides timely information. You'll notice their smiles, the sign of great service!</text>

<text>My experiences at Pearl Dental Group have been excellent.  Dr. Sara and staff are very friendly and knowledgeable.  It's nice to have a dentist who you can trust to do good quality work. I can't really say I enjoy dental care but Dr. Sara and her staff definitely make the best of a bad situation. I am so thankful for their highly professional skills, patience and kindness.< /text><Response>None<//Response><rating>5< /rating><name>Margie Arambula<//name>< Pictures>

Hello world. It’s very rare to feel comfortable and not nervous at a Dental office but at Pearl Dental Group in La verne, it feels like you are visiting friends. The ladies at Pearl Dental are really amazing and it feels great after being in their care. You need to give them a try and experience the love. I highly recommend them because  it’s amazing and they all lead by example by being professional and they all have great teeth and great smiles.<//Review>

I love this place before I went here I hated the dentist
Others did not do a good job I was butchered and taken advantage of sucks I know

But with my new dentist I do not only feel welcomed as an individual but also cared for as a person

I you are looking for a dentist that is caring and the staff takes notice of you go here I am not afraid anymore
Love the hot towels nice touch!
Thank you for regaining my confidence and trust !<//Review>

So glad I went to one more dentist. She really knows her stuff. Took care of the problem another dentist created. Was open and honest about what I needed and even gave me an estimate of costs, far less than what others had quoted.  She and her team then worked with my insurance to verify everything was all set.  Quickly got me in for my appointment. New crowns with bridge that is super comfortable. Even took care of a few small fillings I had. No pressure just helped me resolve the problems very professionally. Highly recommend. I've found my dentist at last.</text>< Pictures>

<Text>Okay, so they told me not to say this, but I really enjoyed the way they had their hands in my mouth.

Jokes aside, I think Pearl Dental is the reason I started going to the dentist regularly again. I hadn't gone for years, but when I needed to get my wisdom teeth out, Pearl was the closest place to my work with positive reviews, so I gave them a try. I was satisfied with how painless the process of scheduling and billing was. They even send me text reminders because I like to forget that I have appointments coming up. The wisdom tooth removal was pretty easy as well. I wanted to "steal" one of my molars to keep because it looked cool, so they offered to clean it before I put it in my pocket lol. Since my first visit there, there have been times when I didn't have dental insurance, but they were willing to work with me with the out-of-pocket costs. Oh, and the staff is super friendly! I like that they have conversations with you even though you can't speak while your mouth is open. Don't like to talk? They can be quiet too. I'm going to keep going to Pearl Dental as long as I live in the area. Oh, and Gloria kindly reminded me to leave this review. I kept telling them that I was going to leave one, but I"m so bad about these things.

Anyway, I invite those in the area to try out Pearl Dental. What's the worst that can happen? You get really attached and end up having to move away ;P</Text>< pictures>

<Text>I’ve used the Pearl Dental Group for all of my dental needs for the past two years now.  I live in West Covina and can go to any of the many dentists in the local area, but I choose to drive to the Pearl Dental Group in La Verne. I've found Doctors Sara Shirazi and Ben Reyhani along with their incredible staff to be an outstanding group of professionals who are extremely dedicated in providing the best customer service and dental care possible. After a review of my problems, they set me up with a dental plan that addressed all issues. Their staff worked with my insurance company, to ensure my needs were met under the company's plan, and they assisted me in working out a payment plan for work done out of my pocket. I found their pricing to be within range of what I expected for the services I received and I'm very happy with the end results.  The staff at Pearl takes the extra time to ensure that your personal comfort is met and maintained while under their care. All staff members are extremely friendly and courteous, and treats all patients as family from the minute you walk in to their office. I highly recommend Pearl Dental Group to anyone looking for a full service dental practice with a touch a class. You are not just a patient to these good folks, you are family, which is why I will continue to drive to La Verne for my dental needs.</Text>< Pics>

I never though I would say I enjoy going to the dentist, but that was before I met the team at Pearl Dental. They are very friendly and accomidating. I have a 3 month old, and they helped take care of her while I was getting my teeth clean. Their concern for my oral health was forefront. I have had a few cavities filled here. One of them broke (I guess I am an aggressive flosser), and the Pearl Dental team had it all fixed up in no time. Definitely a great place to take yourself an dyour family for all your teeth needs.</Review>

Dr. Ben it's one of the best Dentists I ever ever seen! Listens to you and keeps asking if you are ok. His assistant Elvi is also super carefull and does a great job assisting Dr. Ben. I defenitely recommend you come in to La Verne Pearl Dentist Group. The recepcionists are also very friendly. Ask for Gloria or Katia.< /text>

Started my day with a flat tire but with Quinlan my day was not to much interrupted. Thanks for always treating me right. I will always bring my business to them first.<//text>< Pics>

Aaron is always so helpful and kind.  I brought my car in for a replacement wheel and he made sure to check all my tire pressure knowing I was headed out on a cross country road trip.  Hes always willing to help and provide quick service. I will miss knowing I dont have someone so reliable at my new place of residence.< /Review>

They did an awsome job on my ST.  New Pirelli ruber and cleaned the hell out of my wheels.  Great prices and service from a longtime family run shop.< /text>

I have purchased tires for two of my Honda's at Quinlan's and could not be happier. Aron's recommendations have been wonderful and have completely change the driving character of my cars. They are much quitter now and I am very happy. Even though this is a place where buses, farm equipment and big rigs come for their tires the selection for cars is huge. The prices are the best I have seen. I highly recommend them.<//review>

They are usally very busy, but when ever I had to bring my vehicle for tire change. They got me in and pretty fast. Have doing business with QUINLAN'S since 1960.

Clerk wasn't wearing a mask.  Neither where the people inside shopping. So if that bothers you then this is not a good place for you.< /Review>

Absolutely terrible, debit card only and a $0.35 fee for ALL purchases!  Yes, even for a small purchase like a water.. Wow, how can you do business like this in the year 2016?  Also, how is this fee benefitting me as the customer?  I will NEVER come back to another ARCO, and I will spread the word as far as I can to take your business elsewhere.< /text>

I love the personal, handwritten notes that I get on some of the packing lists that come with my online orders, especially the ones that are shipped from the Sacramento area. That unexpected human touch from an online order goes a long way! Thank you 💛</Text>

I was in search of a board for my son who's a beginner with state boarding. Ms. Sarah showed EXCELLENT customer service from the time I called the store. She was extremely helpful and held my hand the entire time until I was satisfied with my purchase. She was able to also provide suggestions as I'm also new to the boards. Thank you Ms. Sarah for your help and very professional demeanor. You are AWESOME! You've made forever customers from my household. Oh.... and my son LOVES HIS BOARD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! That speaks a lot of your products.<//Text>

Wow! Everyone in this store is really helpful. I was looking for something good for a neon dance party and I had everyone giving suggestions. My son picked a tie-dye Mars Attacks shirt that looked awesome thanks to the staff here.<//Review>

Me and my sister went in there to do some shopping and Sully was helping me out. When I went up to pay for my stuff he rang me up. I quickly noticed I was a few dollars short. As I soon I was going to tell him just take out the stickers he said I got you bro. He paid the rest with his card but i felt kinda bad. That literally made my day. ill soon repay when I go back there (I'll make sure I'll bring the right amount this time Lol) May God bless your heart and soul and to everyone else working there. Keep it up Zumiez!!!< /Review>< pictures>

I love this place. They have good taste in  music but it's just a little bit to loud. The employees were very helpful & super nice. No matter how many times we made them go back and forth doin the same things again & again. They all have great poker faces. Lol It's not a bad place either to fix all of our broken skateboard parts & issues. They have a decent selection of parts. I am definitely coming back & will recommend this place to friends & others.</text>

Only minor complaint I have about the place is that its pricey! But what isnt these days. Most friendliest staff i have met. Very attentive, but not to pushy or over bearing. Great music, awesome boards, awesone everything!!</review>

Arden Zumiez a year ago did not  meet my expectations of customer service , but since then it’s been unbelievable, must be new management new people ... but for moms buying for  their kids it means  everything when you’re on top of it and really engaged with everyone that comes in whether they’re old or young it doesn’t matter.... and I feel management  reflects how employees treat the customers,,,anyway out of all the Zumiez I’m saying Arden is one of the best and I love the Ethica underwear that I wear  and all my boys  and I am trying to get them Hopefully to get girls /boy cut same as the men’s only maybe a little shorter for girls they are very good material breathing and comfortable and I think we should have some of those awesome little prints that are very suggestive why can’t we be fun and too,,,,,,,!,,,,,,,,,😜 they also have the most awesome national donut day pong and making up donuts for the kids I’ve ever seen ....Go check this place out</text>

Luca and Destiny are awesome went in to buy my son clothes shoes a long board and both of these people were so helpful in picking out the latest styles of clothing my son is into. Luca is very knowledgeable in boards and long boards. He suggested great durable long lasting skate shoes. Hands down the greatest customer service I've encountered in Arden mall. The only thing that was a bummer was this zumiezs didn't have any trucks to build our own long board. Other than that I had an awesome time shopping for my son at this zumiezs location. Awesome work Destiny and Luca.<//Text>

< review>
Asked several people in the store if they had a hoodie I found on line that said was in store. All of them did not even attempt to look, said they didnt know then burried theyre heads back in the boxes they were unloading. More excited about stocking the store then helping a customer.
Never have been the type to shop online, I enjoy the experiance of retail shopping untill today. They told me to go to Tully's.
Give 1 star for stocking shelves in disarray< /review>

The manager, Zelda if that's her real name, needs serious professional help. I merely came in to check in on a pick up in store order 6.5 hours after placing it (site specifically says orders are ready in about an hour) and was completely scolded and talked down to for coming into the store. She told me "if I would read the email...," which is BS because she didn't even know the order was there or how to deal with it. I would have never got my stuff if I didn't come in to check. She proceeded to tell me to "look around I'm not a $300/day store," when half the employees are doing nothing. It's retail, these stores won't exist in a few years. What a joke.</Review>

<rating>5<//rating><Review>On October 3rd, 2018 I purchased a 2012 Toyota Camry Hybrid LE with 97k miles. I’m going to share my experience with buying this used car at Auto Boyz in Garden Grove, California. This could get long but I want to try and detail what I went through and why I whole heartedly would recommend my family & friends to this used car dealer.

I first called the dealer to make sure that the Camry was still available. A salesman named Joe answered the phone and confirmed it was. Now it was about less than an hour before they were closing but he told me I could come on down and check it out. I got there and it was 30 minutes till they were scheduled to close. He didn’t mind and didn’t rush me at all. Joe was very nice - professional and honest! I’ve always had my reservation with used car lots and their pushy salesman tactics. However, none of that was present here. Joe answered all my questions and then we went for a test drive. First of all, the car was in great condition and they had it for a fair price too. I remember looking back at their inventory online and thought they had a solid stable of used cars. What I really liked about my experience with Joe was that he had nothing to hide about the vehicle. He showed me the Carfax report (which they have for all their vehicles) and even the 30+ point inspection report that they put all their cars through which is done by a local mechanic shop nearby. At this point during the test drive, I was speaking openly with Joe about how neighboring used car lots (I’ve shopped around, called and read numerous reviews online) do this thing where they tack on a “dealer fee” sometimes to the tune of up to $1k. For no good reason, separate from sales tax, registration, etc - they just have that and I believe that amount just goes straight to their pockets! So I asked him if they have this type of fee and Joe straight up said NO, that he is aware of other used car dealerships who use this tactic to make extra money. At that point, I had a good enough conversation with Joe to know that he wasn’t full of it and when we got back to his office he even showed me on paper everything that I was going to be charged for on top of the car itself - basically unavoidable sales tax & registration fees, etc.

At one point during my walk around inspection of the car I noticed that the hood latch release was not working. It wouldn’t release the hood to open. I mentioned it to Joe and he made sure to wrote it down on the things they will take care of after the sale.

I had a trade in, they took that as my down payment and I financed the remaining balance. No other money down, just the trade in. I do have excellent credit and got a fair interest rate - this is a used car at a used car lot so you can’t expect new car interest rates from a big name dealer.

Well over an hour past their closing time, I was a new owner of a pre-owned Camry Hybrid! Joe Peraza was the salesman I dealt with and I genuinely enjoyed my car buying experience because of his great personality and honesty. His boss, Bob, was also there and although I only had a very small interaction with him, I would say based off of that, he too shares the same values.

Overall, they have great customer service, great cars and fair pricing. I’d like to add that a few days after taking my Camry home, I ended up at their repair show and they sorted out the hood latch release problem quickly and they too had great customer service (Zuby’s Brake, Tires & Wheels - just down the street from them also in Garden Grove). I have already told family & friends about my positive experience here and I will recommend them due to the way they treated me. I wish more used car lots operated this way. Great job Auto Boyz! And thank you Joe, I’m enjoying my new used car! -Andrew C.</Review>< pictures>

Even after two years later, not only is our car running well, he is still open and willing to help. He assisted in finding the best refinance option.

Bought a 2012 Toyota Venza at this dealership. I have to say, from what I experienced, they are 100% legit. Pleasure doing business with Juan. I was prepared to go in with 1000 down...lender wanted 2. (But...that means they actually did get approval from a lender. On Sunday, no less. As opposed to a yoyo scam.) They accepted my original 1000. Payments are good for someone with my credit. Car is gorgeous. That is all I can say just now because I am waaaay too tired from buying (which is draining anywhere) and coming down afterwards and desperately need some sleep. Full review at a later time. Bottom line, happy Venza owner.<//review>

< review>
This is my first time buying a car. I am so impressed by this place! Brian and Tom was so understanding and really helped me look for the car I wanted. They were not pushing and rude like other dealerships. They were relaxed and had such a calm energy that made my anxiety (searching for a used car) go down. Brian kept me up to date with all of the Camry Hybrids in my budget. I really appreciate his hard work and making me feel at ease (like I can ask him anything). He really cared and wanted me to find my perfect car. 🙏💜

Tom had such a calm energy. I seriously felt like I can be myself and let my guard down. I know this place wouldn't try to take advantage of Me and sell me a car just so they can make a sale.

I am definitely bringing all my friends and family here!!! Thank you Autoboyz!</review>

<Text>*Disclaimer: I did not end up buying a car while @ Auto boyz because I wasn't quite ready to buy - but I wanted to write this review because the test drive experience was so great*

I was hoping to buy a car while visiting my parents in SoCal in December and Auto Boyz was one of several places we visited to test drive SUVs. Joe and Augustine were so helpful and non-pushy. They didn't feel like they were trying to swindle me into anything like the vibe I got from every other place we test drove that day. Though I didn't end up buying at Auto Boyz, they will be the first place I look if I ever need to buy while in SoCal.< /Text><pics>None< /pics>< response>

8/8/2019 UPDATE: We purchased the Mazda from Autoboyz July 19th. After less than 3 week the transmission burned out. My mistake for purchasing and trusting a full-price vehicle with an AS-IS sticker. From what i recall, we were not offered a warranty for this vehicle (i will have to check the contract for warranty, but im pretty sure i was told by Joe that no warranty was available for this car). I bought this vehicle for over $8,000, put $1500 down. We are still recovering from the cost of the vehicle purchase, i am stuck with a high interest loan on a car that doesn't run, and a transmission rebuild will cost me about $3,400.

my advice, these guys are professional, the lot is nice, but stay away from anything they sell with an AS-IS sticker on it, they use poorly rated local mechanic shop (ZUBY'S) to refurbish used cars with several complaints of over-charging and poor quality work.

(REDACTED) "I've never had a better used car buying experience than this. We needed to buy a car that day; after some paperwork and some good work with the banks, they had us approved and in a good car by the end of the day. The whole process was about 2 hours, testing driving and sorting the documents. The lot was decent sized, they had every different car size and style, the overflow lot was full of new inventory.

Martin immediately had the confidence that he could get a loan that would work for me. My credit is pretty ugly, and he found a bank to work with it.

Bryan and Joe were great guys, thank you both for helping get us into a car. The 2010 mazda I purchased was a win. They gave us a carfax report, nothing but good news. One owner, full maintenance report, couldn't ask for a better deal on the spot. Great work guys."<//review>

Randy and Joe are amazing indivisuals who are VERY patient, and truely care about helping others. They didn’t care just about making a sale. They did more than enough to make sure me and my girlfriend got what we needed. We are truly thankful! We were so confused at first, but they guided us through every single step. We got a beautiful 2012 Nissan Altima. They got us the perfect car for an amazing price! We definitely recommend giving autoboyz a shot! Thank you so much Joe and Randy. God bless.< /text>< gmapID>

After getting into an accident late last month I was in need of a new car when my old one was declared a total loss. I didn't have much of a budget so I had started at a spot in gardena that held auctions. I almost pulled the trigger on a car, but after talking to my friends I held back.

I did some research and found some cars at local dealerships, but each had some recent terrible reviews. When I came across AutoBoyz I couldn't believe the 5-star reviews across the board on both Yelp and Google Reviews.  I live in Culver City, but made it a point to at least go and check out their inventory.

Upon arriving I was greeted by Bob who politely told me if I had any questions to let him know. I was then left alone to check out their current inventory. I came across a 2014 Volkswagen Jetta, which I really liked. I asked for the CarFax and what it would cost out the door. Bob gave me a print out copy of the CarFax as well as a full breakdown of what it would cost. I ended up leaving to check out some more cars at other dealerships to compare, but left happy with the no hassle experience.

After running in to the typical pushy car salesman I came back to AutoBoyz the next day. Bob walked me through all the paperwork thoroughly and I drove off in a new pre-owned vehicle for myself. A+ Customer Service, I highly suggest stopping by AutoBoyz if you're in the market for pre-owned vehicle.< /text>

A hole in the wall but great food to go or eat here on back patio (was?dog friendly). Have you discovered the coconut pudding?!! It’s yummy, sometimes I just drop by and grab one from the drink dispenser that right inside the front door! And their Poke bowl is more than ample.👍🍲<//Text>

<Text>Delicious food and ample parking.

The signage for the two lines needs to be improved: one for ordering and one for pickup. They have tape on the floor by the door, but it looks like an entry and exit sign.

Had their pokè bowl twice and.....one was great and one was pretty good.  So come and hang at this place. Chill, very Hawaiian spot on the north side if downtown.  Live music early, nice outside part to eat quietly if you want.<//review>

Food is actually ok, but the front desk was so rude, which make the experience very bad even for a pickup order. The owner need to consider to put a friendly person on this role under the current COVID situation, since more pickup orders.<//Review>

<text>Authentic Hawaiian food at a reasonable price. The atmosphere was fun and featured live music. The menu was extensive and featured a wide variety of options. They even had homemade pineapple coleslaw which was delicious. I enjoyed the kalua plate and my boyfriend got the poki bowl. It was delicious.</text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMgFU-2ek8-D2e8b3XiieubzxYBJk5U10NSyklZ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO-wif2UZpk0wkqyFpaDOWMRc894TG0zVP-5nYe=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures><response>None<//response>< GmapID>

<date>1503140811247</date><Rate>3< /Rate><Review>Decided to go to Santa Cruz to enjoy the beautiful weather and found this cool little place for lunch. The restaurant is housed in a old building that I think might once be a warehouse of some kind. All orders are placed at the front counter and brought to your table once it is made. We ordered two poke bowls and a fries with pork. All the food sounded great until we got it. The fries and meat was rather flavorless and greasy. (just FYI, I love fries, but this just wasn't one of them) as for the poke bowls, they were decent, but definitely nothing to write home about. All in all, the restaurant is cool, but the food has a lot of room for improvement!<//Review>< pics>

<Review>Good place to go if you are looking for a Hawaiian cuisine. My Kalbi tasted good with the rice and I like how flavorful the the macaroni salad was. My husband got the loco moco and it was good as well. As we were leaving, we saw how the line was already forming outside. It is a popular spot so make sure you allot time. Parking is metered and limited. 👍< /Review>< pics>

Good ambience, live music (we went there Saturday evening), very interesting food + drinks, reasonable price! This is a seat -yourself place where you need to give order on the counter and they bring you food. Minor comment is that the presentation of food could be improved a lot. But overall good experience!<//review>

Delicious food and lively atmosphere in the back patio. Food arrived to the table quickly and everything we ordered was delicious. Poke bowl was full of fresh fish. The live music from inside was a great addition. Will definitely return here to try other options from the menu.< /Text>

<review>They messed up on my bill  and gave a 50% tip. Wow !! I usually dont look at my credit card that closely but now I will. The poke bowl had barely any tuna in it as well. Maybe 6 cubes. Not happy !! Never going back.< /review>< pics>

<review>Fresh poke salad. Quite pricey for the portion.

I still come here when I crave for poke. Overall I like the flavors, there are about 10 cubes of ahi tuna in the salad. I think for the price of $ 16 they could really give us a bit more fish.< /review>< Pics>

<rating>4</rating><Resp>None</Resp><Text>Complicated review here. 4 stars not because I loved the place nor because it wasn't a nice place to eat or the fact that their food was/is great or not.

The bathroom was the only negative item that stood out immensely; not a restroom anyone would prefer to use unless absolutely needed to. It was busy so maybe they didn't get a chance to freshen it up for a while.

I never been to a "Hawaiian" joint before and had no expectations, but it was referred by a local-ish person who said many great things about the food. I had no idea what to order or what I actually ordered. Not a huge fan of sushi but found out the "55" was sorta a sushi bowl with pork. It wasn't not great, but I have no acquired taste of it as of yet. The Cola drink was not a Cola drink, more like a flavored soda water. In terms of atmosphere and service I have to say, it was peaceful, comfortable and had a hometown feel to it. Most at my table were not satisfied with their orders but my sister who is a vegetarian loved the food she ordered (apologies for not memorizing her order).

When in town I would like to try this place again and do a bit more research on the food itself prior to ordering.< /Text><pics>None</pics>< username>

<text>I was on the fence about whether to give Pono's 3 or 4 stars. I think 3.5 stars is probably more accurate. They share the space they are in with a separate business (the Reef Bar), which means if you order food from the counter at Pono's (and want anything other than some canned Hawaiian Sun sinks), you then have to order and pay for drinks separately from the Reef Bar. Kind of a hassle. Also, here's yet another eatery where it's mostly self service (order at the counter and they bring your order to your table when ready) but their Point of Sale terminal defaults to asking you to leaving a 15-25% tip...Hmm. On the plus side, it's a nice casual space with plenty of indoor and outdoor (pet-friendly) seating. Pono has a pretty vast menu of apps, salads, bowls, plate lunches, burgers, and more. We tried the Coconut Shrimp Appetizer, which was ok, but shrimp was a bit small and overdone. (Not as good as Coconuts Maui Fish House in Cupertino or Hawaii). My spouse ordered the Chicken Teriyaki Plate which was decent (2 pieces of boneless dark meat) and comes with rice, and choice of Mac salad or coleslaw. I ordered the Braddah Poke Salad which comes loaded with Ahi Poke, over mixed greens, cucumber, edamame, canned mandarin oranges, seaweed salad, kimchi, and pickled ginger. Good portion, ahi poke was pretty fresh, not crazy about the canned mandarin oranges. Overall, food was decent but not particularly memorable.<//text>< pics>

The price was very reasonable for lunch. The outdoor seating area was wonderful, and the bar looked good (many options, fun cocktail ideas too, just didn't have anything).The food wasn't that flavorful, my rice was mushy (overcooked), and very bland, the mac salad almost dry. We enjoyed the kalbi short ribs.  I wish it was better!<//text>

This place has to be the most expensive Hawaiian food I've ever had, but at the same time it's probably some of the best Hawaiian food I've ever had. Poke is great, the chicken katsu and barbecue chicken is all spectacular. Great for date night or just hanging out with friends. Great ambiance and sometimes they have great live music.<//text>

Hyped up more than it should be. We had the Hawaiian pork bbq and chicken teriyaki bowl. Pretty standard items that tasted ok. I expected stronger flavors. Aside from the food the placed looked like a good place to listen to live music and grab a drink.</Review>

Personaly don't like the food here. Poke is plain and taste quite different from typical poke shops in bay area. It's a chill place and the live performance here is awesome, so I give it 3 stars.</review>

Loved the vibe of this place. The crowd is chill. The food is awesome. Definitely recommend it. There is outdoor and indoor seating. You place your order at the entrance - the menu is placed at ghe entrance (this can be a wait but it's worth it!)<//Text>

Pono Hawaiian Grill and The Reef Bar are two of Santa Cruz's original Hawaiian food and drink connections to the Islands. The food selection is amazing, and the drinks from the bar come with a little flare depending on who your bartender is (can be more). The staff are wonderful and always aim to make sure you are happy. Coming in on a Friday, expect a bit of a wait, but while there, enjoy the friendly sounds of live music. It's a great place to experience your first bowl of poké.< /Text>

We're hoping this is just one isolated occurrence since it's always been great before.  And the food was excellent as always.< /Text>< pictures>

Met some friends here for dinner. Everything we had was really tasty, both food and beverage.

Our service was top-notch, even on a busy Friday, and our waitress was kind enough to take photos of our group for us. She also took a selfie with our phone, so I've included it to make it known that she is awesome, and this place is worth your time.<//text>

<Review>The wings were tasty, but very salty. The Lau Lau pork was juicy and tender, but was just straight traditional style. It had no flavor expert for banana leaf. Not my favorite and I wouldn't order it again. The Mahi katsu taco was the best thing I tried! One bite had like 20 flavors.</Review>< Pics>

<review>Food was good, reasonable price for casual dining. I docked a star for several tuna poke pieces being very chewy with connective tissue, a couple had so much I spit them out. I haven't had that happen with other poke bowls I've had, so I assume it's unusual. Not a deal breaker though.</review></record></dataset><record>

It's alright, the poke is.... if you've had real poke then it's whatever. I'm sure it's better than most in the area though. Shouts to the cutie in the glasses at the register, she knows what's up.<//text>

Live music in a Santa Cruz institution. Ask for the Magic Munchies band. Great Polynesian food in generous portions. Order at the door with food delivered to table by prompt and courteous servers in an unhurried atmosphere. Full bar and outdoor dining. Great place to take friends and family for a casual and fun evening.</review>

You must like upbeat places and crowds.  And exes.  I always run into exes there.  Hectic. Happy in a loud way.   I like quiet places.  Good food though.  If you like  Hawaiian food it's good stuff.< /review>

This was my first time back home in 15 years. I expected better from SC. The fact that this place has such a high rating shows the low standard of people flooding what was once a really great town. Tasted like something I microwaved... but four times the price. Maybe I went in on a bad day. The cashier was very nice however.< /text>

Two orders - one for poke bowl and the other the burger.  The poke bowl had less poke than customarily served in Hawai'i for the same price.  I would rate the poke bowl 3 stars.  The burger was ordered medium rare and came with french fries.  What was served was a cold patty cooked well done making it dry as well.  The fries had been refried a second time though in doing so were served hot. The inedible fries and the burger together rate 0 stars.  Thereby the reasoning behind the 2 star rating.< /text>

I ordered the Salmon-Cilantro & Avocado Poke as a wrap plus a side of Sweet Potato Fries. OhMyGosh the fries were bomb! I would of been good with just ordering the fries. It was my first time trying Poke and it was interesting. The salmon was delicious and fresh and the wrap tasted good as a whole except for the nori in it. The nori was too tough and I couldn't chew through it. Their salsa though was delicious and added great flavor to the wrap. Atmosphere: live band jammin modern songs with a Hawaiian ryhthm. Cool looking decor and a very nice patio area with warming lamps for evening enjoyment. Good first time visit here with great company.</Text>

Great lau lau. French fries were amazing. Their turkey burger is a processed turkey patty rather than ground turkey, which I'm not a fan of. And you have to order drinks from the bar attached to the restaurant, which is really weird.<//Review>

Orfered a poke bowl. Fish was fresh but I'm not a fan of their wet, moist white rice. I think I prefer the kind of poke bo that has a lot of sides on top so this would only be a 3 star for me.</Text>

Lovely food and Atmosphere, most nights the line is out the door and down the street which sucks because you then have to wait. The service is good although food takes some time due to the crowds.< /text>

This popular local spot offers up delicious poke. When I arrived this afternoon at 2:45pm, the line to order was out the door, as families celebrating the winter holidays together were out for a late lunch. Most poke items are listed as spicy, but there are a few that are not. I usually get takeout for someone who lives in Capitola -- worth the drive!</Text>

<Text>Reasonable prices, wide selection. Can get busy, especially evenings and weekends. Bring a jacket in the evening, there are not enough heaters outside for all tables. The macaroni salad is delicious! I'm a fan of the Loco Moco plate or burrito.< /Text>< pics>

<Review>I love this place. The food is great. A healthy take on Hawaiian dishes. My only reason for not giving five starts is that it's noisy. When there is a large group or performance it is hard to hear the person across the table. Definitely try for a table out back. That way you get the atmosphere. Overall I recommend this place for Hawaiian to all my friends.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

Salmon Poke bowl wasn't good. Fish tasted old and salty.

Excellent food, live music often and a bar if you just need some drinks and pupus.  I make a point of stopping in to see Timmy and the crew from time to time to get my Hawaiian food fix and soak in some island vibes.  I am thankful they are just a few blocks away from my office downtown.  <3< /review>

I visited from out of town. My beer and coconut shrimp were amazing. My friends brought their large dog which was welcome and had plenty of room and shade. The outside seating was very comfortable and I liked that it is separated into a few areas. It was festive and felt fairly cozy.<//Review>

Decent location and decorum however the food was of poor quality and was improperly prepared. Outdoor seating is the highlight. Dog friendly. Decent bar. However the food is inexcusably bad especially the salmon. There were still inedible bits of skin and cartilage in the salmon poke Bowl. Worse yet the rice was inconsistent and at worst like a oatmeal cement paste. The staff wasn't very friendly and the amenities we're not kept in Supply. Bathroom was disgusting and the soap dispenser was filled with a mixture of water and soap. Utensils are self serve and have fingerprints on them because of the way they are stored and sometimes they run out in one area and you have to go across the restaurant as I had to do that the one time I went there.< /Text>

<text>Pono's was real, yummy Hawaiian food. The environment is very spacious and audacious, the pictures and all the boards is what I'm referring to. Everyone at my table enjoyed their meals and I loved mine, so much that I decided to try their pie. Some milkshake pie that tasted really good, but sadly the cookies weren't on the same level. You can't go wrong here for some real Hawaiian food.</text>< pics>

This place is a gem in Santa Cruz. Delicious food, and live music with hula dancers on the weekend. Minus one star because some meals are overloaded with Teri sauce. E.g. spam musubi. Overall a fun atmosphere.< /Text>

<Text>Good food, but it took a good 50 minutes to come out. Ordered at 8:15, got food after 9. Which would have been fine if their chalk board didn't indicate food will take 20 minutes to come out and if the people who ordered after us didn't get their food 20 minutes before we did.  Would go again when it's not busy</Text>< Pictures>

The owner Timmy Hunt has a great staff and good thing going in the place where this restaurant and bar is located. Food is great at the same time you are able to get a great drink cuz it has a full service bar and the drinks are worth the price. Will definitely be interested in returning on another Aloha Friday night that has Hawaiian music that all can enjoy even kids. 2 thumbs up for sure. Way to make it work, thanks to Timmy Hunt, I'm sure Maui is proud to say job well done. Aloha, Homai< /text>< date>

<text>The poke salad is excellent. The salmon looked good the previous time I ate here also. This time around I got a kalua pork wrap and it needed sauce, it was dry and flavorless. It says it comes with mayo on the menu, so maybe someone forgot it. The menu is confusing and could use a redesign. I don't like the tables with the mesh top. The paint color in the bathroom is nice, but I don't like the artificial smelling air freshener. I enjoyed the live music.< /text>< pics>

A poke place with live music. The protein (fish and pulled pork) were both alright. We ordered and dined in. The food was filling, a rice bowl size of rice with seaweed, pickled ginger, protein, etc. This wouldn't be my first choice for poke but I assume that in Santa Cruz I got to make do!< /text>

Really quite an odd experience.
Place is dingy, like a worn out sports bar.
Food ranged from mediocre the bad.
The live music was terrible. I think it was open mic night.
The beers were basic af and $7

This place is a tourist trap.
I recommend avoiding it.</review>

Great food. But ordering is funky, have to stand just inside the front door to order, have to stand outside if busy. Have to order drinks of any kind at the bar separately, inconviently.....</Text>

<Review>Great food, good drinks, great music! What else could you ask for ?
Pono is in a decent place in town and is easily accessible. I wish there was a bit more parking, but anywhere downtown is rough to park at. Everything on the menu here is delicious and the live music makes the experience much more pleasant as well. They also have nice outdoor seating. My reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is because the last time I was here, and this haooens often, the bartender was very slow, we had to ask our waittress if the food was coming because we saw it in the window ready to go for at least 5 minutes without anyone taking it, and the waitress didn't engage with us in any way when they brought our food out even though there were a few things we needed. The waitress was very nice, but just not paying attention much. This was during a dead time when we were one of the only customers there.
Despite this, it is a VERY enjoyable experience and will continue to always come back as well as recommend this restaurant to our visiting friends and family.<//Review><pics>None< /pics></record></dataset><record>

I love this place but when they bring your food like coconut shrimp combo and you pay 20 bucks they don't bring any sauce.No cocktail or  tarter sauce.<//Review>

<userid>116023148608867453613</userid><review>This place used to suck before the current owner. The ambiance is still a little off beat, the outdoor eating area out back is really rustic and the indoors is fairly hip, if loud with live music and sort of pub-like open floor plan. But truly, the food is great. Love the lau lau here. Really all the things I've tried were at least good.

A word of warning though, if you get the lau lau, it comes with a small cup of chopped onions with a bunch of fancy pink salt on the bottom. You may not see the salt - I didn't. I felt like the waiter should have warned me of this and I told him as much. Never seen anything like this, and I really don't like salt all that much. But now I know and I would definitely order it again<//review>< Name>

I went there about an hour after it opened with family and ordered french toast, but they said that they ran out of french toast after just an hour of opening (they said that morning that it was a slow day too). For the outside patio, they have a water dispenser where customers can get their own water, but some of the cups were dirty. Overall, it was a good meal and I would probably go again.< /review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

The food is well prepared and portions generous. It's a busy place with a line extending to the sidewalk. It's not a fast food place, expect to wait a bit, but worth it. There's been good live music each time we've been there.</review>

Hard to find using GPS but totally worth it. My husband gives a odd ball review considering it was our first time and only ordered two dishes. Beware of generalized reviews is all I have to say. I grew up in around Hawaiians and anything goes with rice including macaroni salad, which was delicious. Live music, Full bar, tropical outside and inside patio seating made this place fun. We ordered the Kahuku style sauteed prawns and Hawian Kalua pork. The servings were generous. Kudos to the chef's in the kitchen!</review>

The food was good but a little too pricey for such small portions and they also messed up my order the last time I was there but it is a calming and peaceful place to grab a quick lunch at tho. I would give it three and a half stars.</Text>

Just so so. No dish is outstanding, but all feature oddball pairings. Who eats rice AND macaroni salad? The sides need a wider palate. The bathroom is literally crappy. Using Google Maps to find this place confuses even Google.</Review>

Tried the teryaki chicken. The sauce was really good. My girlfriend had the short ribs and they were just ok. Counter service, but fast and friendly. Comfy indoor and outdoor seating. Porch is dog friendly.<//Review>

<text>Great Hawaiian food and a cozy Polynesian atmosphere, a perfect fit for Santa Cruz. I get the Kalua pork plate, subbing the macaroni salad for a garden salad. The food is great and the restaurant often hosts musicians who play Hawaiian music as you chow down on your plate lunch. Pono Hawaiian Grill offers a handful of vegetarian and vegan options.<//text>< Response>

<Text>Very tasty Poke. My rice was a little undercooked but my husbands was perfect. The saimin(ramen noodles) and hamburger was also very good.  The music was nice. Not too loud. We sat at a table right next to the band.  We also got a bunch of giveaways from the band. It was a great night.< /Text>< Pics>

I enjoyed the food, service, and atmosphere of this place immensely. I had a poke bowl and spam musubi - both very good. Also had a pretty tasty Mai Tai. my husband had a loco moco and didn't like it that much though, but we both agreed the spam musubi was good... and that's what matters!!<//Text>

The bar was nice friendly staff good music.   One stars. Kahuku prawns was more like frozen shrimp cooked w onions. I dont think they grow prawns in kahuku, but they cook their shrimp with garlic.</Text>

It's always amateur hour at this cross between a local music spot and Hawaiian-theme menu. Service is sometimes friendly, always unskilled, sometimes the kitchen puts something fairly close to the menu description on your plate. On the plus side, the food is often fairly tasty and fresh, outside seating is quite pleasant, and dogs are welcome. That's good, because inside can get very noisy when there's music.

There's a bar, but no waitress service, so after ordering and paying for food at the front door counter, you stand in line again at the bar. The closest thing to service is that someone brings your food to your table. It's hard to get a menu of the little dishes, which is mostly what I want to order, so it's always a hassle figuring that out.

I really wanted to give this place 4 stars for the times they get it right, but that's only about half the time, so it's 3.< /text>

The only good thing this place has going on is that is open til 11pm on certain days. Otherwise, the service is terrible, food is average. I tried the Pono's BBQ combo, which had Chicken Teriyaki, Beef Teriyaki, & Kal-Bi Ribs. The combo comes with rice and mac and cheese. Chicken and beef were fine, but the ribs were what I would say, a bit carbonized to my liking.  At the time there was a live band playing hawaain music and it was very loud; when we looked for a place to sit, only couple of tables available were dirty. I asked a waiter to clean one, and she never came back, so I went to the register and asked for a rag so I could clean the table myself. On my 2nd visit I tried the pork Lau Lau as I had never had it and it was tasteless, not to say a bit bitter. I forced myself to eat it, but definitly not a good experience. Not sure what pork lau lau is supposed to taste like, but I wouldn't order that again, at least at this joint. The desserts on the other hand, were good. But overall, the staff needs to do their job there and at least clean the tables.<//text>

<Text>The food is good, but the amount of time you have to wait before receiving is is abysmal.

I have been here three different times and each time I have found myself remembering why I told myself not to come back the previous time.

If you aren't in a rush or want to call your order in for takeout Pono has good food, but if you are hungry and expecting something right away, go elsewhere.</Text>< user>

< Review>
Very disappointed.  My husband is Hawaiian and this was a disgrace to Hawaiians. It's more like a McDonalds Hawaiian food place. It's just as bad as L&L.

Cons:
*My husband ordered the Da Ali'i ,$22!  It was horrible.
*The Lau Lau came to us cold because the 2 ditzy blonde waiters were busy on their phones sitting at a table in their aprons chillin and our food sat at window.
*original lau lau has a fatty fish on it to help keep the meat soft. His lau lau had no fish in it with the pork.
*the customer service is horrible. Like i said they had 2 young waitresses who didnt want to do anything. We asked them to clean our table because it was sticky and she had an attitide about it. They wanted to be on their phone constantly or flirt with the young guys that came in.
* the lomi salmon that comes with his combo wasnt great, either was the poi and the Haupia.
*I ordered the Chicken katsu. Sad to L&L was better.
*the chicken katsu wasnt very warm, hard skin, like it had been sitting.
*mac salad had no flavor.
*no parking
*have to stand in door way to order
*order drinks SEPARATELY from bar and then wait in a long line for refill because there is 1 bartender.

Pros:
*Keiki menu
*baby changing station
*10 min from boardwalk
*dog friendly patio< /Review>

The food was pretty bland (I had teriyaki chicken bowl and my husband had the smoked pork). They seem to nickel and dime you to death. Extra $. 75 for brown rice, $. 25 for teriyaki sauce, $. 50 for carry out. The teriyaki chicken very much needed some extra sauce as there was barely any on it. I would definitely skip it as there have to better places to eat in Santa Cruz.<//Review>< pictures>

I have been here three different times and each time I have found myself remembering why I told myself not to come back the previous time.

If you aren't in a rush or want to call your order in for takeout Pono has good food, but if you are hungry and expecting something right away, go elsewhere.</Review>< Date>

< Review>
SO SO GOOD!  The atmosphere, the music, the drinks AND the food. My husband and I have fallen in love with Pono and make it a weekly ritual to come for dinner. He craves the kaluhua pork fries and Mahi Mahi tacos. You really can't beat anything on the menu. Everything we've tried so far has been delicious. There is a great dog friendly patio we've used many times. Highly recommended!</Review>

First, and this is a big one, the rice is often wet and mushy.  Go to any plate lunch place in HI and you'll see that even the cheap hole in the wall places get the rice right.  I've commented to the wait staff about this and they were apologetic but my impression was that it didn't go beyond that.
The saimin  is good but the noodles were over cooked one of the two times I ordered it.  Chicken Katsu was dry. Recently I ordered my loco moco cooked medium and the patties were burnt on the outside and rare on the inside.  Were the patties frozen when they were placed on the grill? Service staff was nice but mediocre.  I think they would benefit from a bit more experience or some more intense restaurant training.  I really want to like this place and will likely try again, but please, at least get the rice right.< /Text>< Rating>

<Review>I went here once, last night, October 7th, 2017. I didn't eat any of the food as I wasn't hungry but I wouldn't have wanted to eat here anyway given the obvious negativity and judgement I felt towards me coming from nearly everyone in the establishment, including the people I went there with. I went outside to sit on the back patio with a friend who is also employed here. While sitting outside a giant RAT scurried up to us and then slid into a crevice under the deck. As if that wasn't bad enough another employee and friend of my friend came out and regaled us with a story of blatant sexual harassment from a customer who grossly groped her and told her she was so beautiful... I have no respect for this establishment and if I go there again its just to find another reason to sue their ass. Disgusting.< /Review>< response>

< Review>
Went for the first time after living nearby for a couple years. The first thing that struck me was that the poke menu was hard to navigate, no prices anywhere but I guess it's catch price probably so you have to ask at the register. The pictures online look incredible, I had to try it.
I got a Salmon Ceviche bowl. I don't know if I ordered it wrong, but it looked nothing like the dozens of pictures posted. At first sight it was a bowl of Rice, Seaweed salad, and tons of Ginger. After digging the ginger off the top I did find about a half cup of salmon and tomato. It might've just been a bad night to go, it was totally empty at 6pm. I also got hotwings, and at $8 for 8 wings I'd suggest going elsewhere in town.
Props to the bartender though. She was super sweet and the happy hour Margarita was on point for $5, I might return just for that. And over all the service was good, just disappointed by the food and the portion size.<//Review>

I had the Kalua Pork, after reading some bad reviews, I was worried. Then I got my plate, and I was amazed! I lived in hawaii for 3 years and Hawaiian food was every where, then I moved to cali, and I was sad that I couldn't get foof like that anymore. The staff was amazing, the food was amazing. I could have asked for a better afternoon<//Review>

< Review>
Bartender tonight was Asher - he plays music there but mostly bartends now.  Friendly and relaxing attitude & service. Lots of friendly locals around - Josh told us about an accident / closure on 17 & advised us to go around & drive safely. Wow, talk about taking care of your fellow humans!

Full stomach and leftovers will get us home! Chicken katsu, Kahlua pork sliders, Kahlua pork fries, spam musibi, & manapua ( yeah, eyes bigger than our 2 stomachs!) All of it was Ono!!!!

We'll be back (again)! Mahalo!< /Review>

{'time': 1493239762437, 'text': 'Aloha Aaron, so glad you enjoyed the different aspects of our restaurant. We would like you to know that we actually are two separate businesses under one roof. We apologize for the drink selection as the Reef bar there is in charge of all of the beverages minus the Hawaiian Sun drinks.  The reef bar is our landlords and we are only the food service aspect, therefore we are only allowed to have those in our cooler.. We are also sorry you did not experience a good environment for your family. We truly strive to be nothing but community and family  oriented in all we do here.  We will take your review into consideration and see what we can build upon. We truly appreciate your business and we hope you will return someday in the near future… All of our Aloha.

<user_id>102033897909901605570<//user_id><text>Not from the area but stopped in -with my family- during vacation. Although the restaurant states that they're family friendly I didn't totally feel welcome there with kids. They do have a kids menu though which works just fine but it isn't the highlight of the restaurant. I tried their ramen style soup (-fish cake). The broth was very delicious and my favorite item that I tried. I would have enjoyed a cup of broth minus any of the other ingredients just to drink. Panko breaded tuna and panko breaded chicken. Both were tasty. The pineapple coleslaw was very nice. Wings were typical wings. Service up front was very friendly/helpful. Would like to try more of their food.

3/5 due to their ordering/seating set up and their lack of drink variety. After figuring out what you want to eat (cross referencing menu item names/basic descriptions with 2nd menu with more detailed menu item descriptions) you order up front, pay, take a number, and seat yourself. The only drinks they sell are canned fruit punches in a variety of flavors none of which we found appealing or interesting. Had to go the bar adjacent to the grill/restaurant to purchase drinks and carry them back to our table.</text><gmapID>0x808e402f4083b061:0xc45909b9a2dda43b</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Food: 1/5. Saimin was flavorless, broth tasted like water. Spam musabi wasn't marinated, just hastily fried up, still cold in middle. Portions were ok for the price, but not impressive.
Atmosphere: 4/5. Friendly and casual, lots of decor without kitch.
Service: Order at the counter, they pick up the plates. Seat yourself. Service such as it was is okay, definitely not a place to go if you want a service experience.

Overall, I'm not impressed by the place. Usually places like this have to have much much better food to survive. I've had better hawiian at literally every place I've tried.</Text>

Best Hawaiian food in Santa Cruz by far. The poké is fresh and their house made kimchee is insane. Highly recommend the traditional shoyu poké bowl!</Review>

I came in with a large party after my sisters graduation. We all got more than enough food but the only thing I didn't like was there were no options on the menu to order for either a table or big group of people.</Text>

<Date>1491961967356<//Date><rate>2</rate><Text>Ok ill be nice,
Being from maui its hard to find legit hawaiian food on the mainland because there is none, and I dont give a damn what L &L claims cause that food/crap is not hawaiian! Anyways I had the Ali'i plate because when I saw the lau lau, I just had to get one! Lau lau in da mainland!? I thought i found my missing part in life, but i was sadly halted in a small awakening and somewhat hit by reality...."duh we in the mainland!" It was dry, my braddah,  mr chef, please dont be shy with da hawaiian salt please just give em!" Also one or two more luau leaf would've  helped. Cut it smaller, lau lau supposed to be juicy and meaty, one part shoulder and or butt and another part belly for fat. But the kalua pig was good. Lomi salmon..... nice rendition but not the same. Im pretty sure the salted diced Salmon is cheaper than fresh salmon, so make it like how we eat it at home! Or not, its your buisiness. The poi was decent i know its expensive, so watered down was expected, i just needed real lomi lomi salmon on top but i already mentioned, not the same.. the haupia was good, if that was bad i wouldve given one star. The lau lau is the star of that plate, and it needs help. The food reminded me that even though we are thousands of miles away from home, we are still thousands of miles away from home. #almostbutnotreally  besides the food the dining area is cool and has a "chill" vibe with nice island reggae music ^_^</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>
{'time': 1492010443479, 'text': "Hui! mahalo nui for the review. Maui boy? Baldwin high right here brah..! Anyways gonna talk story with my kitchen crew to find out why the lau lau was dry.. not supposed to be lidat Brah.. Lomi too.. we only buy the best fish so I know was fresh but I saw they were cutting it too big.. mahalo brah, I'll take care of these issues.. if you like cone back and try again email me and we will get you a gift card to try em again bu... e Kala mai,\nBraddah Timmy"}<//resp>

Braddah Timmy, Since moving here from Kihei of course we were looking for some good Hawaiian food..We found it at Pono and love the relaxed Island feel of your restaurant...We have been there twice but noticed that the tables werent cleaned and the floors had not been swept or cleaned. Maybe it was a busy day but heads up, that will drive customers away faster than anything....we had to wipe our own table before we could eat and it wasnt that crowded. Then, we saw a waitress deliver food to a table and she was on her cell phone....a little bit too casual..We will definitely be coming back for the food but would just like to see it a little bit cleaner..Thanks.< /Text>

There are tens of poke places opening up everywhere in California. This place takes it to a different level. We came on a saturday night. They had a live band that did some covers. We're not locals, but really enjoyed the atmosphere.

We had the Pono Poke plate. 2 scoops of rice, edamame, seaweed salad, and ahi. They have different flavor ones, we got the garlic ginger one if i remember correctly. We also got the kaluha pork fries to share. It was really delicious.

The people here are also very friendly and there were people of all ages out that night. So, it's very open. I love the beach town atmosphere even when it was freezing outside in the middle of november.

There 's a Reef Bar attached and they serve great micro brews on tap as well as some special drinks.</review>

(Translated by Google) Very good food. The attention was very good and very fast, since we had to make a line to place the order. Then, we sat down and after a few minutes they brought us the food. There was live music.
