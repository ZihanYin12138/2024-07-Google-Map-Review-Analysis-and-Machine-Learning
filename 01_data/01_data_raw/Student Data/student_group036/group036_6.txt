Have always had a great experience with the food and it always makes me feel healthy afterward. 3 stars because they almost never answer the phone and close up very early compared to the hours listed on the door. Has resulted in driving to a closed shop on more than one occasion despite arriving up to an hour before closing.</Text>

<rate>3<//rate><Text>This place is ok. Don't get me wrong, the products they sell are delicious! Good quality ingredients. However when I did go in, I was standing at the register waiting for them to take my order. The cashier didn't even acknowledge me and he kept joking and talking to his coworkers, while I was patiently waiting. When he did acknowledge me, he didn't even smile, didn't even apologize for the wait, and I paid for my item, and hurried up to call the next customer! What's up with that!? Thats why I say, its just ok for me. I'll find another smoothie bowl place that appreciates my business.<//Text><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None< /Response><GmapID>0x80dcdc35b4ab96dd:0x6b2ca13fe3ca9064< /GmapID></record>

Oh ya!
Second visit here and great once agin. I forget what I ordered but it was delicious! I ordered a medium bowl and it was so big they put it in a large container.

The açaí was a creamy consistency, not too frozen and not too runny.

The fresh fruit on top was fresh. Blueberries were so yummy! The strawberries were so sweet!

I asked for a scoop of peanut butter on top to add some protein and it was no problem.

Highly recommended<//review>

Very disappointed, hate it when they close early to clean up! Why don't they just post that they close 7 minutes prior to actual closing times. Also, if customers make a conscientious effort to come to your store, please serve them and don't turn them away! Will not return!!< /review>

Best bang for your buck 24oz for 10 dollars. Açaí tastes great and they let me sub in pitaya for banana in the blend no charge. Highly recommend.< /review>

<Review>Our bowls overall we great, healthy and restorative. Choice of ingredients was fantastic and the bowls were created with care.  However, the kiwi fruit was under-ripe and altered one of the flavors of one bowl. The team addressed the issue in a very friendly manner, however, check the ingredients before adding.<//Review>< username>

I’ve had many great Acai bowls before but this place is perhaps my favorite.  I’m actually craving one right now as I write this.  Everything is super fresh, healthy and loaded with amazing flavors.  My go to is the Peach Bum with honey and extra coconut shavings 🤤 so good.</Review>

Overall good food, but employees fail to follow directions. I had asked an employee to hold an ingredient in a bowl due to an allergy and they put it in the bowl anyways. Probably should look elsewhere if you have severe food allergies.<//Review>

Very impressed with this place for $11 you get a HUGE BOWL, I mean it’s gigantic, you might be able to feed a family of four...I think this is the best value açaí bowl I’ve had, and the granola is without wheat! Except for the molasses they use in it...And it’s organic where they can do it! And there’s no matcha which is a plus for me, I don’t want to eat uppers!!! Super happy customer, will be going out of my way to go here again! That’s my cup holder for scale....</review>

< Review>
Where do I begin when the name says it all, paradise indeed with every bite with every visit. Consistency is key but how about topping it off with every visit, and that's what this place gives me. This place never fails me and I come here a lot, always the same great bowl everytime. I am so happy and fortunate that this place is close to where I live, but I would drive miles for the perfect bowl. And I think two key elements add to this  paradise experience, great management and amazing employees. Always smiling, always happy to serve, and always fast service with never a compromise on the delicious bowls they serve. Jordan and Zion from my perspective are A1 performers, seen them handle pressure with ease. Skimming through the flow with style and always so happy to help, and serve these amazing variety of bowls. Thank you guys for always making my day by offering consistent amazing bowls and making my experience always so delightful, worth every penny, worth every visit.< /Review>

Not to mention they are pretty helpful in making simple subs since I personally hate bananas. Place is usually busy during lunch time since it's in a popular shopping center but you can always order ahead of time. Definitely try it out if you're looking for a healthy alternative.</Review>< Pics>

I like the consistency better here since the texture is a bit more solid and not as slimy (not sure what else to say) as other bowls I've had.

I also recommend calling in 15 minutes ahead of time if you want to skip the line in case they have one. Makes it easy to pick up and go.< /Text>< rating>

Update: if ordering by phone, FYI they don't answer phones within 30 min. of closing time.

Cheaper than other healthy bowl and juice options, but same quality. I'd recommend their smoothies over the bowls here.</Text>

When I went it was empty and while choosing our items, my friend and I were laughing, I'm not sure if that was the reason but when I went up to order I did not like how the cashier was. As I said, I was laughing so I went up with a smile and generally feeling happy.  His way of ringing me up was kind of "uh huh .. let's get this order over with" I tried to act like it didn't bug me and continued to order. He really made me change my mood. The people who made my order and gave it to me were very nice, I did not catch their names unfortunately, but that male cashier really should not be a cashier with that manner. Hopefully no one else gets an experience like mine.</Review>

If only I could afford to go here more often.  I generally order the "Barefoot Bowl".  Staff is friendly enough for how busy they are.  I wish they had a punch or stamp card for returning customers.

Update: They have now discontinued the availability of Goji berries.  -1⭐<//text>

<review>Paradise Bowls always satisfies my acai bowl craving! It can get pretty busy, especially during the summer season so expect to wait a bit.
I haven't tried many acai bowl places, but why try any other new places when I get great quality bowls from here!!</review><Pics>None<//Pics><Rate>5< /Rate>< gmap_id>

The best acai and pitaya bowls in Southern California. The staff here is Young and energetic and mixes up their own special blend of these smoothie type bowls, but will customize to whatever you want or don't want. The best I've had anywhere. Healthy and nutritious desserts that everyone loves.</text>

Yummy yummy stuff!!!
But the staff, the staff!!!!! Stiff!!!!! Seriously, I want new employees, they do not smile, their faces are like zombies..... Service is soooooooo slow, common!!!!!!!!! I wait for like 15-20 minutes for an item, unacceptable....
And they are asking for tips????!!!!!! Sorry, I am a tipper, but I have to urge to give them a penny........< /review>

My 2 1/2 year old boxer loves going to the VCA in Larkfield. She’s treated so well by the staff that she doesn’t give me a second look as she goes off into the exam room with the staff. I like knowing ghat she’s confident and feels safe with the employees.</Review>

We have been taking our dog Junior here for nine years, and he has had the best of care.  Dr. India McEvoy takes her time to explain everything and our options, and I feel he is offered the same care she would give her own dog. She and her staff are friendly, and he enjoys his trips to the vet.  Highly recommended.<//text>

I had an emergency situation with one of my dogs and they took me right in. Everyone in the office was very nice and considerate. They took time to make sure that my dog was ok and did not rush the visit. I like this place. It was my first time going there as I had just moved into this area. I will continue to take my pets there .<//Text>

The best vet! They take good care of my little kitten. They are so sweet, professional and affordable. I am a newish pet owner and they always listen and address any concerns I have with my little one. Also, I adopted my cat from the county shelter and they waived first visit fee, which was super awesome. I recommend them to everyone.< /Review>

<Pics>None</Pics><name>Mathew Carr<//name><text>Every time we left the vet. Every single time, our dogs developed secondary issues from seeing this vet. Either they have highly unsanitary practice or there is something fundamentally wrong with their practice. We are moving away from the VCA brand and finding a vet with better standards. Our doctor was wonderful but something isn't right here. There is no reason that our dogs should have had more issues after leaving then when they went in. In addition they rarely told us proper aftercare or supplied us with proper medication leaving us to manage these emergencies and issues in moments when we should have been well informed. I urge you to take your animals elsewhere.</text><Rate>1<//Rate>< user>

This was the Veterinary office recommended to me after I got my first puppy. Their staff is highly qualified and extremely kind. They went above and beyond for the first medical incident with my puppy. Their office is clean, they are extremely organized, and their email appointment reminders are very helpful. When I take my puppy here I know I'm in good hands.< /review>

The doctors and staff that work at Lark field Veterinary Hospital are wonderful, caring individuals who are dedicated to the health and safety of our pets. Our dog Molly was a shelter dog and consequently she is shy and somewhat skittish. Everyone there is so patient with her and kind. We have only good things to say about their service and feel very comfortable with the care that our Molly has received. We love that they are local and not a franchise that pushes plans on us. These are good people and I recommend them highly.</Review>

<Review>I am more than pleased with the staff and their services. I took my recently adopted rescue dog in for a well check and in the course of conversation regarding my problem getting the rabies certificate the vet took it upon herself to locate the, out of area, facility where her shot had been administered and put in a call. Upon receipt she emailed me a copy immediately. Now Tinsel is properly licensed. They will be our vet for all future needs.<//Review>< Pictures>

We recently moved all of our dogs to the Larkfield Veterinary practice after years w/ our vet who retired. It was  such a relief to find the same concern, care, interest, and commitment to our dogs that we had with our previous vet. The front desk staff are very friendly and competent. And the first time we took our 4 dogs to meet the new vets for exams, the dogs had the same reaction they had with their previous and longtime vet......absolute delight and happiness at meeting them and being there!  They clearly felt very comfortable with the vets and staff. That's all I can ask for!<//Text>

We are new to Santa Rosa but have the best vet ever!!  They were able to see our doodle on an emergency basis same day.  Great front desk reception and the vets are first class:  thorough, sensitive, knowledgeable, and respectful.  Their prices seem more reasonable than our last vet which is an added benefit!  Got to them, you won't be disappointed!< /Text>

Not having children of my own, my three dogs are my closest companions and the most important responsibilities in my life and the Larkfield team makes it clear that they feel the same! Top-notch, innovative, affordable healthcare for my pets sets them apart - but the compassion, kindness, love and caring each person on the Larkfield team shows to my animals, and to my partner and I when we visit, is why we will never switch vets! They are simply the best!</review></record>

If you are looking for a collaboration of people who genuinely CARE about you and your pets, this is the place to go! Having worked extensively with the staff and with both Dr. York and Dr. McEvoy, I can say that from a behind-the-scenes view, these people care about your pets. The hospital prides itself on being affordable, friendly, helpful, clean and efficient. Dr. York is extremely thorough and explains all situations clearly to patients, and is a wonderful doctor. Knowing everyone there personally, I can truly say these people will love your pets like their own and will do whatever it takes to make sure they get the very best. If you have a choice between vet hospitals in Santa Rosa, this is undoubtedly the place to go.</Review>

<text>Great service. Dr. Sheehy is the first vet who was able to handle my usually nice 14 pound cat without sedation. He has always been very difficult at the vet. They even drew labs without any trouble. He personally called with lab results and did not do unnecessary add on tests like some places.

I have been going there for about ten years. Dr Sheehy is a new addition, but their front and back office staff has always been great.

I am making an extra special effort to support Larkfield businesses. Our community was devastated by the fires. Help us support our neighbors........

Best vet ever! We’ve been going to Larkfield for over 10 years. Even after relocating to Petaluma I still choose to go to Larkfield! Best people, best service, best vet!<//review>

We have three dogs in the family, all of them have been treated at Larkfield Veterinary hospital. Larkfield is the best veterinary clinic I have ever visted in my life! Staff are very very friendly! Dr. Sheehy is very passionate at his job, and he gives lots of love to my dogs every visit. They only sell you what you need, and pricing are very reasonable! Would recommend it to every pet owner in the area!<//Review>

I wrote a note an d I guess it was lost. I wanted to say that Posey  (12 pounds) had her physical.  The Vet came down to her level and I was on the bench and she was close by...no problem....I think she enjoyed the  Vet's attention and showed off a bit. The front staff is always happy to fill the coffee water.  Then there is Billie...he clips Posey's nails but I remember him for his compassion when I had a sick dog and a dog that had to be placed....five stars to all of you and thanks.<//review>

My dog & I ADORE the staff at Larkfield Vet.  She is always soooo happy to go see them,  even after two stomach surgeries as well as stitches in her ear from running too close to a rose bush.  They are the best!</review>

I only visited this vet hospital once when I wasn't sure what was wrong with my dog. During this visit, the Dr. took lots of time with us and unfortunately found out my dog was much sicker than we had expected. He supported us on follow up phone calls and after my dog passed away, they took the time to send us a sympathy card, even though we only visited them once. I'll return there when I get my next dog.<//review>

Dr. India McEvoy took over when Dr. York retired who I had for many years. I find Dr. India McEvoy to be a good listener and answers your questions and explains why this or that is needed. Though young I think she will be as good as Dr. York.</Review>

I love the staff at Larkfield Veterinary Hospital!

I rescued a dog recently and had a coupon to receive her shots from Greendog. I hadn't had a dog in 15 years so I asked a ton of questions.  They were very patient and answered all my questions.

Since December, my cat Sheila had been ill. I had taken her to another vet nearby. After 4 visits and several doses of steroids she was not getting better. I made a call to Larkfield and took her in. The doctor spent 2 hours working with my cat to finally solve the problem that had made her so sick for months. The price was very reasonable and she is finally well.

My animals are now loyal Larkfield Veterinary Hospital clients! So grateful to have found such a caring staff to take care of my furbabies!</text>

<text>Do not be fooled by the modest, quaint appearance, this hospital will give your animal the best one on one care and attention in Sonoma county.  We would follow doctor Kevin Sheehy anywhere, but at larkfield you make no compromises; the rates are low, the care is exceptional, and the direct and timely communication affirms that your pet is always their number one priority.  After searching for years in hopes of a hospital with more personalized care, we finally feel at home here. We will never trust our best friends' health with anyone else!<//text><Name>Danae Blythe<//Name>< Time>

<Rate>5< /Rate><review>Our primary home is in San Francisco, but we have a small condo in the Larkfield area of Santa Rosa. The last time we were staying there, our small terrier, Poppy, began violently shaking his head and rubbing it against the carpet.

We knew something was wrong and were very concerned, so we found the Larkfield Veterinary Hospital in an Internet search and called them to see if they could schedule an emergency appointment for Poppy.

They responded immediately and agreed to examine Poppy less than an hour later! With a simple form to fill out and only a few minutes' wait, we brought Poppy into the vet. She was thorough, professional and kind. After a brief examination, she identified the problem (an ear infection), applied medication and sent us home with clear, simple instructions and a scheduled follow-up visit.

We are extremely grateful to the Larkfield Veterinary Hospital for their excellent care on short notice, and will certainly call on them again if need arises during one of our visits to the North Bay!< /review>< Gmap_id>

I found them to be disorganized and not very personable. They were very ,very expensive. Definitely only those on the higher income scale can afford them.  They quoted me $1600.00 for a procedure my vet did for $400.00.   Do yourself and your pets a favor and go to Redwood Veterinary. They care more about pets and less about making money.<//review>

<text>i don't do reviews........UNLESS ........i am remarkably impressed and this was the case with Larkfield.
i live in san mateo and was visiting family in santa rosa. my labrador needed some medical attention and i went off my relatives recommendation of Larkfield.
From the first phone call to the last follow up call (aprox 2 months later)
i was impressed with their consistent professionalism and knowledgeable staff. i can not emphasize enough how refreshing it was to deal with a such pleasant group of people. i truly hope they get the recognition they rightfully deserve and sure wish they were in san mateo.</text>< pictures>

I am a regular at this gas station it very clean and well lit up (safe) compared to others that are near by. I would say it's pricey but gas is pricey everywhere. If you like treats or something to quench your thirst they have plenty and always have deal, Good place to fill up<//Text>

<review>I got gas here a few times. I wasn't mugged, harassed, and my car is still working. I even check the card reader to make sure there wasn't a scam card reader (try to pull off the reader. If it's on there good, you're fine. If it comes off, notify the police).<//review><Gmap_id>0x80c2d03830274f05:0x7299c0be63593263< /Gmap_id>< user>

<time>1534570793292<//time><Text>NEVER AGAIN. Entered at 3pm today to grab a quick bottle of water with my 10lb service animal in my arms. Was yelled at and told to leave immediately by a mid 20's staff member with a name tag that read Judith but said her name was Christina when quieried. Note they have a walk-up window, but instead of kindly offering a solution to complete my transaction via the window, she instead fired off one comment after the next with absolutely no consideration for my "situation". I explained that it was nearly 100 degrees and it wasn't possible for me to leave the dog in the car. I explained that I simply needed a quick moment to complete my transaction. She refused. When I asked if she always treated people with service animals this way, she told me it was my fault because I didn't explain myself. She begrudgingly agreed to ring me up while continuing to fire off sharp and disrespectful commentary.  Keep in mind, at entry I wasn't asked..... she simply began yelling at me from behind the counter. She went on to tell me I should have tied the dog up outside. I expressed to her that there wasn't a suitable place to do so within view of the check-out counter and a small sized dog is easily capable of being taken. She then told me that was rediculous and expressed ZERO regard for me as a customer or an individual.  I'm a working professional, polite, and engaging with nearly everyone I encounter.  Thankfully I'm not routinely treated this way, but what I experienced today was downright harassment, verbally abusive in tone, approach, and bias. Service personnel who behave like this are why we're in a culture where people feel compelled to video disparaging and disrespectful treatment. It's wrong and it shouldn't be happening, period. It's easy to provide good customer service in nearly every situation, even when you feel a customer is doing something you think they shouldn't. I can respect whatever policy has been dictated to this employee, but use common sense and offer sensible solutions to someone who's just trying to spend money at your place of employment. I will be following up with the Chevron Corp regarding my experience at this franchise. Personnel should at minimum be transparent in identifying themselves, especially if they're going to specifically use another person's name tag and or identity to avoid accountabilty for bad behaviour. I wouldn't tolerate being spoken to this way by a stranger on the street let alone by a person representing a place of business.<//Text><UserId.>113024223646240430933<//UserId.><gmap_id>0x80c2d03830274f05:0x7299c0be63593263< /gmap_id><user_name>Carly Russell< /user_name>< response>

They blast non-stop advertisements at you while you're pumping gas. Very annoying. I won't be back here.</review>

<Review>I like to say is a good place for food and is  always great... But today and this time is not good I'm not happy and I will say check your food before you live the place... In this case the avocado 🥑 is not good and looks gross 🤢... Taste bad as well... Hope the owner take care this and be more careful with what they serve... I will give poorly reference<//Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPxjIp8NlRf9051sZn52zUWCyByLBPg5ZABDAn3=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMJ4GGfO6iEobaMkLRY9dMVp4BZv6AtnXoJpCMA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures>< resp>

What really makes this place stand out is it's chocomiles (Mexican chocolate shakes) it's almost like the chocolate shakes you buy in Guadalajara Mex. The reason I wrote this review it's because they have quail eggs. If you like milkshakes and never had one with quail eggs then you're. Not sure how to ask for a milk shake in Spanish? Just tell the cashier you want, "un chocomil con huevos de codorniz". I do about 6 eggs they're small but really give the shake a kick in my book.<//text>< pics>

(Translated by Google) I asked for a Milanese cake they took exactly 27 minutes to give me and a smoothie they give you some poptes that are for water the liquid as it is thick you absorb it and it does not rise and I asked for a cake and I had only lettuce, two slices of chili and a piece of flavorless steak, what kind of cake is that, did not have mayonnaise, did not have beans, what kind of cake is that, I'll never buy ANYTHING again

(Original)
Pedi una torta de milanesa tardaron exantamente 27 minutos para darmela y un licuado te dan unos poptes que son para agua el liquido como es espeso le absorves y no sube y pedi una torta y no tenia mas que lechuga dos rajas de chile y un pedazo de bistek sin sabor que clase de torta es esa no tenia mayonesa no tenia frijol que clase de torta es esa nunca mas comprare NADA<//review>

I just moved out but I enjoyed all 3 years. The property went under new management 3 times but stayed as helpful as always. A big thank you to maintenance for all the hard work they do! Gabby in the office has been amazing since day 1! I'm sad to leave but so happy for the 3 years here at Promenade Terrace.</Text>

The staff is great and the place is usually pretty clean (with the occasional dog poop on the sidewalk) the only reason I'm only giving 3 stars is because of the parking.  There are never any spaces available, and there were at least 3 cars broken down that stayed in one spot for months at a time.  If you cant find parking, you have to park what feels like miles away from your apartment.
If they could get the parking situation under control this would be the perfect place to live for years!< /Review>< rating>

The staff are quick to respond to needs and went out of their way to meet the needs of the tenants.
A special situation arose, Kristin and Gabby were extra helpful and thought out of the box.<//Review>

The maintenance techs are respectful and knowledgeable! I was having issues with my dishwasher. It wouldn’t drain so I called the office and they sent over their new tech, Anthony, he took care of the issue in a timely matter. They did a great job hiring the right people.<//review>

<review>I've been living on the property for a year now and have never experienced any issues! The office staff cultivate a very welcoming environment whenever I have any questions or need minor repairs done. The property is cleanly kept and the maintenance team is quick to come out whenever I need assistance. Gabby at the front desk is especially efficient and friendly. She originally gave me the tour of the place and answered any and all questions I had before signing the lease and was super patient with me!< /review><pictures>None</pictures><resp>{'time': 1598553087160, 'text': "Crystal Mariano, we're happy to hear you had such a positive experience with our team!

I'm not one to write reviews however after the experience I had here I just felt the need to express how wonderful and how professional the staff were. There is great restaurants and shopping areas nearby overall it's a great area and a wonderful atmosphere. But what really made my experience was how helpful Gabby was, she was very professional and extremely helpful. This place is 10/10 would totally recommend.<//Text>

Anthony was such a hard worker, came in to fix my water heater and fixed it really fast. I was surprised and happy that it was so easy for him to fix. Would recommend asking for him when something needs to be fixed.</text>

Can't say enough positive things about our community. Our leasing agents, Gabby & Kristin have been extremely helpful & professional. Even through this pandemic, these women are truly a Blessing...Thank you Ladies! Also, our maintenance guy Greg, is top notch. Highly recommend living here with all the upgrades, amenities & amazing neighbors.< /Review>

Even though I leased elsewhere I loved the family feel of the community. Having a 1 year old, my priority was finding an apartment that felt like home and this definitely feels like home. I'm only giving this review because the manager (Jordan) went above and beyond to help us out and was completely understanding when we chose to go elsewhere. Sorry if we wasted your time but you're the best.</Text>

I recently inquired about a space at Promenade Terrace and had a wonderful experience! The leasing consultant, Gabriella Quinones was super kind and helpful, and remained patient while she answered all my questions (and there were a lot..)! Would definitely recommend to anyone else inquiring about available units.</review>

Because you can't be too careful with this devastating pandemic, I chose to save myself time shopping for a new apartment by calling around first before going to visit.  I spoke to a lady named Kristen who was so patient answering all my questions.  Believe me, I ask a lot of questions.  She was so helpful and informative.  She totally understood where I was coming from and even provided me with how to do a video tour!  How awesome is that!  The community looks amazing.  I can't wait to go and see it in person.<//review>

Kristins my go to gal! She was so helpful with all the steps it takes to find a good apartment these days. Another plus was how easy I could get a hold of her and the staff for any questions I had, not a flake like some other complexes I was looking into. Very happy in my new place!<//Review>

I would like to thank everyone at the Promenade Terrace apartments, I would like to give a special thanks to Gabby she took her time in explaining and answering every question I had in great detail. She made me feel extra safe with precautions she is taking during this uncertain time. She has a great and professional attitude I couldn’t have asked for a more easy and pleasant experience. Thank you Gabby!<//review>

Gabby helped a lot with questions and concerns. The prices are definitely good if you compare it to a two bedroom in LA which is dirty and starting at atleast 2500 in LA. I like that Corona is about a 45 minute drive from LA. Not overcrowded at stores or restaurants and it’s quiet and chill. Just go LA for the turn up and return here home when you want to rest and focus.if you really look at the amenities this comes with, you’d know that this isn’t expensive at all. Gym, pool, clubhouse, small park for children. I mean it’s really like you don’t got to leave the house ever. Besides work and the grocery store. Especially since Corona VIRUS is going to be around for the next year or so. Might as well sign a one year lease here and chillax. Gabby was awesome and very VERY quick with replying and paperwork and being professional all at the same time as well as understanding!!< /Review>

She never made us feel unimportant and has always made it a point to have our needs met quickly and efficiently. Thank you so much, Gabby!

I really enjoyed my experience living at Promenade Terrace. The front office staff was always helpful, especially Gabby. Gabby was quick to help us fix any Maitenance issues and always very friendly and personable. She also made the move in and move out process easy and less stressful. The homes are spacious and comfortable and we really liked the amenities like the dog park. The prices are reasonable when you consider the nice area and comfortable luxury type living that you’re getting. We only moved out because we had a growing family but would definitely have stayed if not for that reason!<//text>

I absolutely loved living here! The experience overall was great. Gabby made everything from move-ins, Maitenance requests and move-out so easy and she was always super nice over the phone and in person. The homes are spacious and comfortable (especially the closets) and you just can’t beat having your own garage. I would definitely live here again if not for our growing family.<//Review>

RENTER BEWARE!!! In the 5 years my husband and I lived at Promenade Terrace, management changed 4 times!!! We have had our fair share of problems over the years... The ceiling collapsed and flooded our shower with water from a leak in the upstairs neighbors unit, our fridge went out multiple times and all our food went bad (while I was in labor with my son), the AC leaked inside the wall and water was trapped in the wall causing the wall to bubble up, along with many other things. I wanted to share a few issues because it wasn’t small things like “oh I need a new light bulb”. However, the last straw was when I found out about the RATS living in the walls of our building. Yes you read that correct! Current management, Greystar, which changed their name or title right before we moved out is WELL AWARE of the ongoing rat infestation in my old building (521). Once I found out a rat had been in my home - I went to several neighbors and found out rats had already been in multiple of their homes as well. I found out from more residents that other buildings have had rats in their walls as well. It was heart wrenching for me, finding out as much as I did from others about the rat issues, about the overall lack of care from office staff and about the laundry list of maintenance orders that haven’t been done in months “because of covid” (only emergency orders). Back to my story. The rats chewed through the insulation and wall creating a hole underneath the sink of my son’s bedroom! I found poop droppings throughout the house, even on my kitchen counter. I overnighted rat traps and set them in the cabinet underneath the sink and I duct taped the cabinet shut and we caught a rat that night. Check yelp review for photos! I pleaded to property management and to “That Guy” pest control to do something about the rats in the walls!!! I found out the rats had been in the walls and entering into multiple houses of my building for a FULL YEAR. I asked them to wire a camera through the hole from my home to see how bad the infestation was! I asked them to tent the building and clear out all the possible dead rats in the walls and the toxic rat pee/poop. For the safety and well being of my family and all my neighbors. What did they do? Place bait, wait 1-2 days, come back and patch the hole and put more bait outside the building. That is all they do! Time and time again. It’s a case of PLAUSIBLE DENIABILITY. Property management says we have to follow the treatment plan the pest control company gives them. And pest control says we have to do what we can with the approval from property management. SO REALLY BOTH DON’T CARE! NEITHER WILL FIGHT FOR WHAT'S BEST FOR THE WELL-BEING OF THE PEOPLE LIVING IN THIS HORRIFIC SITUATION. I pleaded and pleaded and nothing more. So I called the city of Corona and opened a case with code enforcement and fair housing! Within 24 hrs of opening the case, management contacted me to offer us to move to a different unit (for the same rent price we currently had) or to move-out with no penalty breaking our lease. So we moved FAR AWAY! To anyone else in a similar situation please look up your fair housing rights - I believe CA 1942 (warranty of habitability). It felt extremely embarrassing for me to share initially but I realized we do not live a lifestyle that would cause rats. We did not cause the rats. Nor did any of our neighbors. The buildings are poorly maintained and rats have found access points from the exterior of the building to get into the walls. I still hope that Greystar or whoever will own Promenade Terrace next will care enough about their residents and clear out the infestation in the walls of ALL the buildings that have rats! I’ve cried thinking about how they may rent our old unit to a family without sharing the pre-existing conditions. I hope that Greystar Management, the office staff and maintenance team DO BETTER and learn basic human decency for their residents.</review>

<Text>I would like to Thank Promenade Apartment Terrace for hiring some of the best employees that make this complex what it is .These individuals make leasing easy, from the front office staff Gabby and Kristin to the maintenance techs, one of which is Greg.

He is extremely knowledgeable and does a phenomenal job always with a great attitude.<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< userid>

I couldn't say enough wonderful things about Gregory! My a/c stopped working on one of the hottest days of summer and having a 9yr in this heat with no a/c made it 100 times worse. Greg showed up on time and looked very professional ready with all his equipment. He was so quick to diagnose that we had a blown out fuse. One of the most impressive things about him was that when he was finished with the job he even took the extra step to make shur everything was nice and clean. Thank you so much Greg  🙂<//review>

I lived at this community for almost two years and had several maintenance technicians came to the apartment to fix things here and there. Greg was by far the best. He was always attentive and knowledgeable. Everything he put together never fell apart afterward. If he’s not fixing someone’s apartment he’s cleaning the apartment grounds! The maintenance team I have at my current apartments makes me value the hard work and effort I saw from him day after day.< /Text>

<Review>Promenade Terrace has not been the best overall experience. There is one lady in the office who is just plain rude. Maintenance does there best, but we only ever see one person. Richard has made me change my mind. He came out to help someone late last night. You could tell he was tiered and over worked. But, he took the time to talk with me and my wife and a problem we are having. I was able to fix it myself from his tips. A very friendly person and a true asset to this place.< /Review>< pictures>

<Review>My experience at promenade terrace went very well. I lived at Promenade Terrace for about 4 years. It is a very good environment to raise your kids in, very quiet and the schools around it are top notch for kids. I would definitely recommend. Affordable living and the staff in the leasing office is very professional and will get back to you ASAP and so is the maintenance crew. If anything needs fixing and you out in a work order, the maintenance staff will be on it very quick, no lagg. Shout out to the leasing manager Jordan Hamm for working with me the last months of my stay. He helped me out a lot.</Review>< pictures>

Very refreshing atmosphere. It just, feels like home here. Many apartment complexes don't create the same vibe this one does. I know it's been taken over recently and the changes have been good. The maintenance people are on point, I've met the supervisor Ramiro and he keeps that property looking great! Thank you</Text>

<Text>Let me say something first before I go on my rant! So I’ve been residing with promenade terrace for 2 years going on 3. I’ve had a great experience with them until now with the new management. First off I placed a work order in APRIL and finally had someone come and take a look at it now (in JULY) so there’s that. When I contact the leasing office, they never pick up my calls or reply to me emails unless I have my roommates send them one to. The staff has horrible customer service and aren’t organized nor do they communicate with each other. I’ve been having an ongoing issue that hasn’t been fixed and they just reply with oh it’s been fixed when clearly it hasn’t. I really feel like they don’t care about their residents so any future resident please re think about staying here.<//Text>< Response>

I love this place! The staff is great but one individual that stands out is Ramiro Ponce. His level of professionalism is unreal and his dedication to his work and his team should not go unnoticed. In short, Ramiro is an awesome supervisor and it's because people like him that make living here such a pleasure.</review>

It’s been safe and quiet since we have been here, I always feel fine letting my two young kids play outside in the grass by the pool. Of course it’s a little expensive, but good luck finding anything in California that isn’t. I wouldn’t say it’s over priced because it’s a beautiful neighborhood and they have always been very accommodating. Tim, the maintenance supervisor, and the rest of the maintenance guys, have always been great at getting things fixed for us no matter how small or tedious. Office staff, especially Sarah and Gabby, have been awesome. If I wasn’t moving out of California I would be glad to stay here longer.

We’ve been housing our salesmen every summer at Promenade for many years. Kristin has been my liason for 5 summers, and she has been a God send! All of the staff is so accommodating to us, with so many guys we have to house it can get a little chaotic & Kristin has been nothing short of a pleasure to work with. It’s honestly why we will continue to work with Promenade for many years to come! They are so responsive to repair requests for my guys & make sure the move ins and outs go as smooth as possible.
Promenade is centrally located to everything so our teams(who are not socal natives) have access to everything. Thank you Promenade team for another successful summer, for always being our go-to, and so awesome to work with!<//Text>

Front staff is great but Gabby is awesome! Love the area and the amenities (pre-covid). I’ve lived here for almost a year and have had zero issues. Only thing I could say to improve would be the amount of people that leave their doggie poop in front of my place near the playground. Other than that, no complaints!< /review>

I don’t have anything negative to say about the people that work here or my surroundings. It’s in a nice location. Maintenance does it’s best to keep the grounds clean and tidy. Other dog owners don’t always clean up their dogs messes but that’s no reflection of Promenade Terrace because they have mire than enough pet waste pickup spots around the complex. The apartments are spacious enough and “lipstick” nice for the most part. Some areas of the apartment are more run down than but they slapped a new coat of paint over it to hide the grime. Overall, I like living here and I feel comfortable here.<//Text>

My family and I lived here for about 2 months now and absolutely love it here. Very friendly management as well as Maintance. Jordan the manager and Gabby the leasing consultant are very friendly professional and eager to help and in any way they can. Maintance is very knowledgeable Rich is my favorite very outgoing but I like them all as well just don’t remember there names. Property is always clean and there is lots of upgrades going on right now they truly care for the property. Love all the amenities inside and out of my home. Full size washer dryer included as well as refrigerator with ice maker. 2 car attached garages. Dog park fitness center and 2 pool and jaquzis as well as play for the kids and clubhouse for party’s. We also love all the trees and mountain cabin type settings we fell like we’re on vacation at a nice resort. Also this is new owners and management from when the negative reviews were written. Definitely give them a look if your looking for new home.< /text>

<Rating>1</Rating><review>THEY WILL SEND YOUR LAST BILL TO COLLECTIONS.  We were told we were paid up in full when we moved out. The folks in the office didn't update their paperwork when we gave them a forwarding address (no doubt written on a post-it like they always do and then lost). Fast forward to a year later  and I have a collections company calling me saying we owe money (Thanks for making me look financially irresponsible).  Other notes, mail boxes are constantly broken into,  dog poo allover the property because some residents are lazy, they have the worst maintenance service around and the people in the office are typically nice but do a poor job of their daily tasks. Obviously they don't care or are too stupid to realize they are potentially messing with peoples credit. Irresponsible either way. Want to pay your rent online? Yea there is a fee for that. Like any other complex they are set up to squeeze every dollar they can from you except these people wont even come fix a leaky faucet within a week. That should give the reader an idea of the state of the buildings.

Man.... I really wish I would have read the reviews before applying here. After reading, it seems as though many people have the same issue that I am currently having. I applied online and was asked to pay a holding deposit before I was even approved, which looking back should have made me run for the hills as I have never had to do that anywhere else. I reached out the leasing staff and requested that my application be cancelled and the deposit refunded. I never received a response. So I followed up again and the response I received was "As we discussed on our tour, the holding deposit will be returned in the form of a check being sent from our Phoenix offices. They will not go directly back to your account. " I was never ever informed of this! I emailed back to make it abundantly clear that this conversation never took place. I truly feel as though my money is being held by them will no reasoning and am extremely frustrated with the entire situation. Who knows when my deposit will come back, if ever. Learned my lesson though... ALWAYS read the reviews of a property before applying.

If you are looking for somewhere to rent, STAY AS FAR AWAY AS POSSIBLE FROM THIS PLACE. Horrible and dishonest business practices going on here.<//Text>

<text>If I can rate them lower than a 1, I would.  I am extremely upset over the management company.  I rented the 3 bedroom apartment and lived there for approximately 3 years.  Yes the apartment is definitely over priced for the area but wouldn't be a problem if the service was excellent.  Unfortunately the management team doesn't care about their tenants.  When I rented the apartment 3 years ago, the apartment wasn't painted but in fair condition.  Wasn't a problem for me, but at my closing statement, the management is charging me $125.00 for patching and paint.  Why would I be charged for patching and paint when the apartment would clearly need to be painted after 3 plus years.  When I brought this to their attention, they offered to split the difference and only charge me $62.50; I declined because obviously I shouldn't have to pay any of it.  As of yesterday afternoon, Deborah the manager stated that there is nothing she can do that the regional manager is still going to charge the $125.00 even though the apartment wasn't painted before I rented it.  This is so wrong by so many ways.  Stay away from this place, they will cheat you any way possible.</text><pictures>None<//pictures><Rate>1</Rate>< UserId.>

< Review>
After a long search for an apartment  in the city of Corona and having selected Promenade Terrace for the uniqueness of their units and common areas, I have had the pleasure to deal with the most professional leasing team, who have been nothing but helpful thoroughout my application process. I am so very thankful for their willingness to work with me.  I looked at pretty much every complex and none compare in anyway.  Five Stars!

I apologize if the refund process was not explained to you in greater detail but, unfortunately, it is just that, a process. We enter the cancellation into our management software system where it is forwarded to our accounting team, they then cut the check and put it in the mail to the address we have on file. These checks are cut once a week, on Thursdays. You should be receiving the refund check by mid-week next week. If for some reason this does not happen and you do not receive your check, please call me and I will do everything I can to correct the situation.\nI am very sorry that you decided to not make Promenade Terrace your new home and I wish you the very best wherever you may choose.\n\nLisa Perry\nProperty Manager'}</Resp>

I would like to say thank you to everyone for the reviews on this apartment. I was looking into renting their, but I will pass this up. It's really unfortunate that apartments look good online and when you go see it in person, but when your actually in their you see the other side.  I do not want to get in and all this is happening. Again, thanks to all the reviews for the heads up.</Text>

<name>Ashleigh Guerrero</name><Text>Gabby was amazing at showing us the places but there was a couple of things that could use some work. First, we got there right before 11 am which was our appointment time but another couple was being helped which pushed our appointment back 15 min or so. Then we finally went in she said they're were no notes left about what we wanted to look at and just kinda seemed unorganized. While looking at the apartment and town home I noticed she only showed us the renovated ones and then showed us pictures of the ones that weren't when in reality we should have been able to see both in person. So we decided we would take a chance and go with the non renovated townhome. We applied and got rejected for supposedly owing or having a court order from last tenant which was inaccurate we fixed it and we're going to just wait to have the screening redone but then I saw the reviews and they weren't to good so I took it all as a sign and backed out. Now we're waiting on the holding fee which they said 7 -10 days which is fine if I receive it so I will update about that.

If i could give no stars i would ........
I Called 6 times in the past 2 weeks to have them come and spray for spiders . No returned phone calls , noone has come out yet . My 2 year old son can spot the smallest spider and it's kinda scary that they are black widows and they still seem to not care ! Glad I'll be moving in a few days . Can't wait to get as far away as I can from these people ...on top of that most of the staff is rude and know nothing about customer service....I wish they would of kept the old management ... I never had 1 problem with equity....</text>

Tell me why we woke up this morning to maintenance people in our apartment?! We had no appointments with them. I didn't receive a email or call saying that they were coming. When I called the office to rip them a new one for letting people in our apartment without our permission they said they would find out and call me back. I haven't received a call back! I walked into the office and they couldn't tell me anything other then they were sorry. Due to their mistake they broke our privacy aggrement. Sorry is not good enough!< /Text>

<review>The worth. Believe it or not. They are terrible.
Nothing they said was right, they showed me upgraded apartment and said I can’t see the one that I’m moving to because it’s under construction, after we moved we surprisingly found it the exact opposite of upgraded. Contiously water league and contiously issues. After all, they STOLE my deposit and want to charge me more for things I have never touched (behind refrigerator..really!!).
I promise you, Don’t do it.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>{'time': 1540846095081, 'text': 'Hello Osman,\n\nWe would like to apologize that your time here at Promenade Terrace was not enjoyable, it is managements goal to see to it that residents are happy.

The costs for turnover were for the cleaning of the townhouse as well as paint costs that were prorated based on the time that you lived in the home.

So far after 4 days ive seen rats not inside but around and by the one of the pools. The people however are very friendly offering food when cooking at the grills kids all playing together it has a very neighborly vibe. But after reading some reviews and the responses by the staff I think the staff should spend less time replying to reviews on google and actually care for their tenates and their entire facility. The office and club house are made to draw you in. It looks all nice and fancy. We were shown the home and told it was move in ready. Along with a few others with similar layouts. Then when we tried to move forward they said none of the would be ready for a couple weeks and the one we wanted they then gave away and told us to choose another one. So we got our second choice but had to wait three weeks for it to be move in ready. This wouldn't  have been a problem if they had been up front about having to do 'repairs' and how long it would take.
The people help make the community what it is but the facility itself could maintained much better. And it sounds like the staff should handle themselves more professionally and not worry so much about replying to all the bad reviews but maybe try and fix all of them instead?</Text>

<review>Our Air Conditioner was broken when we moved in. It only worked about half the time. It eventually completely broke and we asked if we could get it fixed. After a full week of us complaining it finally got fixed. A week after it was fixed, it broke again. We've been at the office 3 times now and we were promised it would be functional within that very day or the following day at the worse case scenario. To our surprise we always come home to the broken Air Conditioner. This has happened 3 times now since the second time it broke, where we have been promised that it would be fixed and we always come home to it still being 87° inside our apartment. We have called every single day with no answer. Then we call the emergency maintenance number and they don't answer either. I would never recommend these apartment to anyone.< /review>< pictures>

<Review>Wow!!! My two daughters are planning on moving here and were in today 4/30/2016 and had a great experience with the office staff according to what they told me. Sarah Polanco was the leasing specialist that toured them and was forthcoming about what utilities need to be paid and rent and fees. This will be their first place and as a concerned mom and a leasing specialist myself I decided to read the reviews because what residents feel and have to say about their community matters and says a lot about the community, staff and overall property management company. After reading all the reviews I'm take aback. Now I am wondering if this is a place my girls should move into. Your living experience should be great from the first time you meet the staff until you leave. While I understand things do happen these reviews make me feel like this place is not what it appears to be!!! Maybe I will tell the girls to look elsewhere. But overall they were all smiles and felt they got great service and good information so much so that this is the place after looking for a while and at several different communities my girls feel they want to go for. We will see. We will definitely discuss before any money is given and I will do my research. I apologize and am deeply sorry that people have beem treated so bad and with no regards. That should never happen and is not okay. Thanks for the reviews they help.< /Review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

<Review>I rate this place below zero stars. First off, the Assistant Manager Kristin Caldwell purposely gave me the business card and information of another employee on purpose and so I mistakenly complained about the wrong employee to Corporate. When I first Moved here under a different office staff things were great, Now all I smell and step in is Dog Poop, I have had 6 rats in my home in the period of 1 month and I was notified by Kristin that this happened because the gardeners were ordered to pull up the fields. Why pull up the fields without a proper way of stopping rodents from getting into resident's homes?  After I asked for an exterminator for the rat in my home in which I took a picture of, she then posted a paper on my door stating that I owe some sort of late fee. Kristen, as well as the Manager seem to thing that they are god like creatures who do not have to be held accountable to anyone or for anything. Corporate wants cheap labor, doesn't do anything about issues after many calls placed.  This place is way overpriced and yet you are treated as a peasant. Kristen and the office conducts themselves as common street thugs.  The only office personnel who conducts herself professionally is Sarah Polanco in which Kristen knowingly gave me her name to report since she was on vacation. I was promised club house access when I moved in now I feel like I paid for things that I haven't gotten.  People smoke weed by the pool, mailbox break-ins, Car break-ins, No security and it will be weeks before they ever fix anything. I went an entire weekend in the Summer with no air conditioning for me and my kids. No after hours help of any kind.  for $2300 a Month I am living as if I live in a housing project. But what is to be expected since the Management, those in charge are inefficient quite naturally everything will be inefficient. I am now paying $400 out of my pocket to get proper help on my overpriced apartment with substandard management who lack empathy and intelligence. Debra the Manager then called and insulted me and told me to just call the 1800 number and not speak to her Assistant Manager about anything. Debra also proceeded to say that she heard a conversation between me and Kristen in which she could not have heard because it was a Saturday and she was not there. She stated that Kristen had her on the phone listening. Really? Isn't that illegal? I could go on and on about the unprofessionalism of this Property. If you move here, beware.</Review>< gmap_id>

I thought I was the only rental tenant feeling this way. After reading the other reviews it seems like we're all have the same views management staff lacks customer service... maintenence  response time could be quicker. . And the crime rate is ridiculous. Since we moved in two years ago our mail box has been broken into 3 times !! We placed a service call 4 days ago on our clogged toliet no response! ! Dog poop is everywhere neither dog owners or maintenance dispose of it.</text>

Mediocre property, overpriced rental rates, utterly crappy office staff. Combine these less than desirable features with nearby gang activity and graffiti, non-residents who use the pool with impunity because the worthless office staff never enforces the residents only policy and you have a recipe for "keep looking for another place to rent". Did I mention the $100-plus per month water/trash bill even for a two-bedroom apt.? No? Yeah, that's in addition to your annually increasing overpriced rental rate. Keep looking if you value your finances.< /Text>

This is the WORST place to live ever since they got bought out and are now owned by Bridge Property management. If negative stars were a thing they would have -100!!! The property management was great until Bridge Property took over. We have had THOUSANDS of dollars of our personal property ruined by the people they hired to paint this place and to our shoes because supposedly what they say is the back up pipe for the AC decided to gush gallons of water into our garage and our shoes were sitting directly under the pipe!! Mind you we weren't even home when this incident occurred so the AC was not running!!! Maintenance took over an hour to come to our apartment to address the issue and even then they had no reason as to why this happened and WE STILL have not received and sort of compensation for the damages or even an APOLOGY for all that they have ruined of ours. They hire lazy people and are inconsistent and do not care for their renters at all. One maintenance guy even informed us that the companies goal is to get every residence in the community evicted or moved to an updated apartment, so they can redo the insides of the old units and charge people more for the updated ones!  LETS TAKE IT A STEP FURTHER the people here clearly have no clue how to do their job! Rent is due the 1st of the month and no later then the 5th, which we ALWAYS pay on the first because that's our pay date. Thus we paid on the first of the month and rent has come out of our account, yet we receive a notice today the 5th of the month aka the last day to pay saying pay or leave in three days. Here is the kicker in this note...they said we are in San Bernardino county which NO we are in Riverside county and ANOTHER thing they signed and dated the form in the future it is dated 5/5/2016 signed by the landlord/owner.

So please they may be attempting to make this place look nicer but the people running the show kill the whole thing!  And the upgrades aren't even worth it!!!! You can get a nicer place that is larger for the same price out in Orange County so if you want something good for your money go elsewhere!!!!!

Want photos of all the damages and this ridiculous letter with errors! Please contact me i have them!< /text>

This is a bustling wine store with a diverse selection of wines to satisfy both preferences and budgets. This wine shop piques my curiosity because it has a wide variety of wines at fair prices. Their customer service is excellent!< /Text>

<Text>I'd heard from a few sources that their beer selection is very good, but that their prices are a bit high. One should expect to pay a little more at a "Mom & Pop" store. I was excited to have my day take me near there so I could check them out for myself.  I didn't even go inside. The staffer with his mask below his chin, chatting away with a maskless customer told me that there are better places to shop.<//Text><name>Gilbert Barragan<//name><Date>1614030085565<//Date><Rating>1</Rating><resp>None<//resp>< Pics>

<Review>Wow have they updates this place! It's like a booze heaven. If you're looking for something new to try or some special or specific drink this liquor store probably has it. The guys in there are always friendly and personable. It's more alcohol focused than snacks or trying to be a mini market.< /Review><name>D<//name>< gmap_id>

I don't pass this place often enough, but when I do, they guys behind the counter know my order and few words need be spoken when in a hurry and always friendly and engaging when you have a some time to spare. They make awesome recommendations for any occasion and have a fantastic selection of craft beer, wine and spirts. Couldn't recommend this place more.<//Text>

Great liquor store for this area. Has a good beer selection, lots of choices from local breweries and a walk in beer fridge. Prices are liquor store prices, usually fair but sometimes you'll find a good deal. Employees are helpful and will help you find what you're looking for.</Text>

<Review>The folks are really friendly, and welcoming. Kinda strange for a convienance store, nevertheless a very good place.

The prices though are standard for this type of establishment, and the selection too is standard fare. They may not have everything, but they do have most items you would want.

To be fair I don’t drink liquor, so not sure if their product offering meets your tastes. It’s worth dropping in nonetheless.< /Review><userid>102671565119406583477<//userid></record></dataset><record>

Neither of the guys behind the counter wearing masks or gloves. No self serve card reader either. Maybe I will head back after the pandemic, but will likely make the slightly further drive to a different place where they care about other people's health. Also most people in the place not wearing ppe.</Review>

Amazing! You have to try it! We got the veggie platter with Awake tips (I believe that is the right spelling) and sanbusa. I just wish they were in OC where I live!!<//Text>

I’ve been to many Ethiopian restaurants and this simply tops all of them. Addis restaurant not only provides amazing food but also gives off  the peak Ethiopian dining atmosphere with music, drinks, traditional furniture, etc... I would highly recommend for family dining as well as a quick healthy meals.<//Review>

It makes eating with the injera and your hands so easy (and mess free). Highly recommend if you're looking to try out a local Ethiopian place.

This place is so awesome! They offer such a delicious and fun experience when dine-in is available.< /text>< user_name>

It tasted like my mom’s cooking and there is no better cook than my mom so this place felt amazing. At the end order a nice hot cup of tea or hot coffee, it comes with the myrrh incense ;) I felt transported to mother Africa the mother of mothers.</Review>

<Text>Really enjoyed my meal! Price was great, food was tasty! It was my first experience with Ethiopian cuisine, so I can't speak to authenticity, but it was a nice experience.

I let them convince me to order my food at a 4 spiciness level instead of the 5 or 6 I originally asked for. It was delicious, but not the runny nose level I intended to order! I tend to prefer spicier foods though 😊. If you typically order spicey foods at Indian or Thai restaurants, you should be fine here too, similar spice scale.

If you're nervous to try something new, look up Ethiopian cuisine guides online and read a little about what to expect (what to order, how to eat, etc). Staff was nice, and can help you choose something!

Give it a try!!< /Text>< Name>

<text>Wow...just wow. What a great experience from the food to the atmosphere. I may as well have been in Africa but shockingly I am still in California. I must say the food is ethnic. A taste of Africa right here in San Diego. This is on my "hot list" which means places I must visit again. Thank you for a great time!<//text></record></dataset><record>

I went here for my birthday , it was my first time trying Ethiopian food and I'm now a convert to this particular cuisine. Friendly and prompt service here as well. Do keep in mind that Ethiopian food is not only delicious but a bit on the spicier side. You'll be alright if you pace yourself throughout the meal while washing it down with a good tea or water!<//review>

The best Ethiopian restaurant in all of California! The food was delicious and the atmosphere is amazingly great. I’m the type of person who doesn’t like to wait their food but this place was a family owned and they were extremely nice and very likable people. So I didn’t mind the wait. I highly recommend this place if you like Ethiopian food. Wish I could give them a thousand stars.< /Review>

I have always loved exploring new restaurants and stumbled upon this one while I was waiting for my car to get detailed. I was pleasantly surprised at the service and the delicious food! Family run and very kind people. Excellent prices and it was fun to watch the Ethiopian videos on the TV. I look forward to going back again! Oh and another bonus is that they now serve beer and wine!< /review>

I went to this restaurant earlier this week 40 minutes before closing. They let us in and didn't appear to be pushing us out or rushing us like most places tend to be when you show up close to closing. The food was delicious and seasoned well. We got two meals family style and left full and satisfied. Food came out fairly quickly and service was good. Only complaint is that the food could have been warmer. Might have been because we were there so late. Still tasted fresh. We will be returning.<//text>

It was our first time trying Ethiopian food and we drove over 30 minutes down from north county to try it out. There are a few in this area to choose from and we went to this one! We loved it! The ambience was relaxed and comfortable and there were neat traditional decorations and seating options. We had a veggie and meat platter that was delicious. Our first time trying injera and I loved the sour taste to it! It added even more complexity to the variety of flavors and spices to each different sample of dishes! The owners were very kind and obliging! We really loved the food and the place! So glad that we picked this one to go to!</review>

Delicious food served the traditional Ethiopian way (you scoop with pieces of anjira pancake). It's a family run place with a very friendly vibe and the service is fast, courteous, and very friendly. Highly recommend!< /text>

<review>Slowest service I've had in a long time. There were only 2 other tables with people when we arrived, but still waited an hour for our meal. Our sambusas arrived still partially frozen. We had to specify which water cups we wanted, otherwise they would only fill one glass at the table and walk away. Food was ok -- definitely not bad, but not amazing either. It was a surreal experience. While the staff seemed kind enough, they real just didn't have any concern at all about running the restaurant. That said, it was relatively inexpensive and decent food.< /review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None</response><Gmap_id>0x80d9545acda96ebf:0xf40bb2779406ae5d< /Gmap_id></record>

<text>Ethiopian food at its best.
First the ambiance super clean and nicely decorated. we chose the flexible seating :). unique but little unconformable. haha. fun for the kids.

The owner was super sweet. they bring out fire roasted smokey coffee beans to neutralist the smell. it was actually refreshing.

we got veggie Combo - comes with most of the veterinarian dishes with the ethiopean delicacy injara (bread). AMAZING.

Fule - Kind of spicy curry dish. superb.
Fasolia - Beans and carrotts dish, amazing.

all the dishes we got are shareable and communal eating style.

This is an amazing option for vegetarians.

We had the Ethiopian Tea, was ok. nothing too great or different about it.

Plenty of street parking and private parking behind the building.< /text><username>Saran Saalai< /username>< Rating>

Orthopedics Dr canceled my appointment the day of my appointment, when I was already in office for the appointment, for a Labor Day Vacation. I was told, when I went to the counter, that the Dr was on Vacation. Why would you schedule an appointment on Labor Day if you had no intention of being there. Why would you not reschedule for an appointment sooner than a month or more because of your neglect. An appointment I scheduled months in advance, only to be told I would have to wait months more for another appointment. Then Covid hit, no appointments for over a year. So I have yet to be seen for an ailment that is progressively gotten worse and all the while been paying a full premium for insurance they won’t let me use. Completely frustrated! Now again just for a physical that I have tried to schedule, repeatedly, for over a year and finally got scheduled, over a month in advance, was cancelled day of the appointment and they want to reschedule for over a month away. This institution does not care about the health of their clients or getting them treated in a timely manner. You will have to wait until you are having an complete emergency and going into the hospital to be seen for something that could have been treated well in advance. If you care about your health, find another health provider. This one is just a meat grinding money making machine. You are just another $ to them and your health can wait.< /Text>

The document was not at check in as promised 2. The 2nd document has the wrong info and the wrong name, upon being asked for info about the 3rd document, found  out the dr had left instructions I never received. My initial “video call” was late and turned out to be by phone which for me is ok as I’ve done rehab before, but it would have been a disaster for someone not familiar with shoulder injuries .   Issues with the pre/op prescriptions as well. Hill St is MUCh more on top if things !!< /review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

Very disappointing, the new building looks great, but the attention is horrible. Pharmacy there is a mess, long lines always and they send text messages saying that your order is ready for pick up when it really isn't...complete waste of time.
They say the lab is open till 8 pm, but after 5pm it takes like 2 hours of waiting just to get a simple blood work.
Again, very disappointing and poorly managed.</Text>

<name>Josh B<//name><time>1596959211403< /time><Rating>1<//Rating><text>I used to be with KP and then came back recently, and this place has gone downhill. Money seems to be the only thing that they care about now, not patients. Also, the care I received was a joke when compared to other KP locations, and both the staff and doctors just seemed like cold hearted monsters with an  inflated and highly unjustified grandiose sense of self, when compared to other KP locations. I felt like I was receiving care from cold hearted robots at this location.< /text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

Very organized. They will text you when you’re being called in so that you can enjoy walking around the facility instead of sitting in a waiting room. Everyone was very nice and welcoming and there’s an ocean view. Really. Pretty cool.< /review>

Walked in and the receptionist gave me a dirty look when I could barely speak and then said loudly “you know it’s a 3 hour wait right now”....and that was it.  She turned away and was done with me.  I left.  Last time i was here about a year ago for a huge cyst on my lower back they did NOTHING and wouldn’t even come near it.  Acted like i was plagued.  Sent me away with no treatment.  This is after i waited 2 hours.  This place is horrible.  Nothing urgent about their “care”.<//review>< pictures>

Took my 3 yr old with asthma. Respiratory tech just handed over the nebulizer attachment so I can give my son the  treatment. Without any explanation.Luckily I knew !!  My son finished the treatment & we were sent home. DOCTOR NEVER CAME BACK TO CHECK HIS LUNGS. As we walked out I tried to ask the Doctor a question & he directed the Assistant or who ever was sitting to help me.<//Text>

<Text>(This review is for the landscaping, not the medical services.) Beautiful California native plantings at this location. Mostly native grasses including Deergrass, Muhlenbergia rigens. One exception is the use of the non-native invasive Fountain grass, Pennisetum setaceum. Well done on landscaping with these beautiful native meadow plants, Kaiser Permanente!< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None< /resp><GmapID>0x80e84d50bda3b7eb:0xd897b1ffa0e7906d<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

They never check out what's wrong with you. It's mostly listen and assuring you nothing is wrong. What kind of doctors are these. I can't even anymore. It's like Everytime I get a second opinion at the medical center THEN I get actual help
Here at Urgent Care everytime it's the same ol' "I'm just gonna smile and give them good news rather than help them or do my job" #GoldDiggers</Review>

I recently took a friend to Kaiser Urgent Care on Market St, Ventura.  I can't believe that I'm saying an urgent care experience was awesome! And I cannot thank the staff enough. Check in was a breeze and Nurse Darlene really made us feel welcome and she listened intently to my friend.  Dr. Kenneth was warm and caring, while maintaining professionalism. He was on top of everything, listened carefully and communicated clearly. And he has a great sense of humor. While Dr Kenneth expedited the lab work and xrays, my friend never felt rushed. The longest (and understandable) wait was for the lab results.  He was amazing and if I didn't already love my current insurance, I'd switch to Kaiser because of their staff and excellent customee service!</review>

I never been in a facility with so much incompetence. They probably spent million on technology that they don’t know how to use. My husband had to put an hard cast on his hand and we wait more then one hour because they weren’t able to find the RX on their new software with the result that he had to take another RX and pay for it!!!
The worst thing is that they were really rude with us when they should had apologized for the inconvenience.
I will never suggest to come here, in particolar way for orthopedics problems counting how rude Dealie Elizabeth was with us.
Really bad experience.</review>

Horrible human beings run Kaiser. Good luck getting a timely appointment for anything.  And the chances of seeing and oncologist before you a terminal is about zero. A Witch doctor has a better chance better chance of curing your cancer than Kiaser does.  Because at you can get an appointment with a Witch doctor.< /review>

I was told about this place, and had to try it for myself, been living in North Hills for years and never knew it existed. Pizza smells and taste good. Perfectly cooked with fresh ingredients, customer service was great as well. Walked in to place my order and my pizza was done within 15 minutes. Parking I would say is the only issue for this place very limited, but order online and pick up is easiest way to go here. It's a tiny plaza with about 6 businesses, but there is plenty of street parking around. My kids loved the pizza, so this will be our new go to pizza place. They have carryout deals during weekdays as well.</Text>

<text>My favorite pizza place. White chicken Ranch is the BEST! Mom and pop business. Probably the only place in the Valley that doesn't charge a delivery fee (which I appreciate and would rather that money be used to tip the driver anyway). I've never had a bad experience here....

Been eating at Pizzasaurus Rex for over 15 years and it's still my favorite go-to place for delicious, super reasonably priced, non chain restaurant pizza. The customer service has always been very good and it's really pretty cool to see them actually toss your dough if you walk in and order. I've introduced many a friend to this place and all of them have enjoyed it as much as I, and have now become customers themselves.</text>

<review>I read the reviews and gave them a try.
WOW very excellent pizza. Like it a lot. New go to place. Have visited a few in the past looking for a great place. Counter staff were cordial.

What else could you ask for. Wait what about Price?? $15.00 out the door for a two topping large pizza. Enough said.<//review><response>None<//response><Date>1573369893383< /Date></record></dataset><record>

Literally the best pizza you will enjoy in the entire San Fernando Valley and surrounding area. Just ate a 16 inch pizza not because I was starving but because it was legitimately so good. They have sauce that tastes homemade and the crust...... oh that damn crust is heavenly. This place has been my number 1 since I first got to the area 3 years ago.</Text>

<Review>I have ordered and picked up countless of orders from this establishment. Today being disabled l offered to pay the full minimum amount for delivery not for a full pizza but just wings again willing to pay the same price as a pizza and was turned away
It made absolutely no sense to me especially during these tough times and my condition they weren’t willing to make the delivery even though l was ready to pay what they would normally charge for a pizza
I think like l said it not only makes no sense paying whatever they would normally charge but found it to be very inconsiderate especially since I’m only a block away but do to my condition cannot drive not walk there at this time. I am very very disappointed and surprised at the lack of empathy at a customer who already purchased almost on a daily bases.
It’s unbelievable to me< /Review>< Pictures>

<text>My girlfriend was craving pizza and this place was close by so we figured why not . Came in, was greeted with a smile, got our order in and got our pizza in a very short time. The food itself was amazing, great herb aromatics, good consistency with the dough the sauce and the cheese, an overall amazing pizza and I'll be coming back whenever I'm in the mood for pizza 😊< /text>< pics>

<Text>I live 5 minutes from its current location on White Oak and Lassen, and having ordered pizza, wings and salad from there over the last three years,  I confidently recommend Pizzasaurus Rex!

For the price, usually discounted with daily specials they offer, the pizza quality is far above the price. It's a pleasant surprise, and a great alternative to Papa John's, Pizza Hut and Little Ceaser's.

The older gentleman with glasses, presumable the owner, is a delight to deal with. He's courteous, polite and a friendly face.

RECOMMENDED PIZZA CHOICE:  medium pizza with extra sauce, pepperoni, pineapple and thick crust.

If you're in the area or searching for quality pizza, give Pizzasaurus a shot.</Text><user_name>Joshua Cintron< /user_name><rate>5<//rate><Pictures>None</Pictures>< GmapID>

<text>Best delivery pizza in the valley.  And the window special, medium 2 topping for lunch pickup is the best deal.  It's 7 bucks or so with card.  For pizza better than store bought<//text></record>

USED TO BE THE SPOT.

Great local spot, love to spend my money here instead of other corporate chain pizza restaurants except their customer service has really gone downhill.

The past 2 orders I've placed have been incorrect ie: adding cilantro instead of basil and not adding ingredients (even though it's been written on the box..). I called to ask for ranch and was met by the owner who was ready to dispute my order placement instead of offering great customer service.

I live a block away from these guys and because of their lack of service I'll gladly drive elsewhere from here on out.< /text>

<review>Best Pizza I've ever had in my life! I can never order from the OTHER GUYS thanks to this place. The staff is friendly and welcoming every time, and the quality of the ingredients are top-notch! You can literally eat an entire pizza to yourself and not feel bad about it the next morning ;)

It's been a while since I've been here, and although I've moved to Texas, I find myself craving this pizza nightly.

I miss this awesome little pizza joint!< /review>

<Review>I used to like it. Local, decent pizza delivered fast. But I just got a large veggie pizza and its bland the dough is not tasty, very little sauce even though I asked for more sauce, said extra cheese but had very little cheese. Ugh sorry guys I'm not buying your pizza again. This dinosaur is extinct in my house.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

Just saw the pizza delivery guy that drives a red car curse at someone because he didn't give a tip. Now I understand that it may frustrating, but at the end of the day its a customer. There is NO REASON to treat people like this especially not in a place of business.< /text>

<rating>1< /rating><Review>Decent pizza. Opening staff on a Monday was incompetent. 3 grown men running the shop. First there register would not take my debit card, paid cash. Second, cashier wrote my order on a notepad, in front of where pizza is prepared. they said 10 mins, I sat directly in front of the store. After 10 mins I asked, they said not ready. 10 mins later I ask again and it was at the bottom of a stack of other pizzas. Finally order was wrong and the shop did nothing to compensate. I requested my money back, total loss. Will never recommend. Again, incompetence, total incompetence!</Review>< pics>

<review>I've been ordering from here every since they opened back in like '89!! $5 bucks for a pie back then lol. But they've remained the go to pizza when you want something quick n easy! A staple in the community and glad to see them still going strong. Try the Feta pizza, awesome.</review>< Pictures>

(Translated by Google) I like it very much ... they serve me very well and quickly ... my order is always complete and I like the taste because it does not have so much fat ... I recommend it!

<Text>Hui Hui made it really easy for us. Jake met us on the bay with paddleboards ready, and when we were done he swung by within 5 minutes to pick them up. It was a perfect day for paddleboarding, and nice not to worry about logistics.<//Text>< userid>

<Text>Super great service , extremely friendly to work. My group of 4 was assured by Jake and couldn’t have been an easier process. Jake was on time for the drop off initially , and my friends and I even got a little lost on the way back , found a different street called Jake and he accommodated us no problem! Have already recommended a few friends that seen my stories over the weekend to give them a try! Thanks Jake!<//Text>< Pictures>

Hui Hui stand up paddle boards were great!  Jake was super accommodating and the boards were ready right where and when we needed them.  High quality boards for a reasonable price.  Will definitely be renting from them again!< /text>

The boards are great quality and the pickup/drop off is super convenient. The guys are knowledgeable and explained to my group proper paddling technique and had advice for the best spots to paddle. I’d highly recommend renting from HuiHui for group parties, family outings, or just a relaxing paddle with a friend. I’m a repeat customer and already booked my next rental.< /review></record>

<Review>Easy, convenient, and fair price! Board was delivered to my front doorstep and I was able to take out on my own. Once done, they came back to my front door step and picked it up. Can't get any easier then that! (Shout out to Kris at Hui Huh. Great service!)< /Review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

< Review>
Super convenient and Ryan was easy to work with.  We were able to do a last-minute rental with Ryan and he was very accommodating.  The convenience of having the boards dropped off where you plan to spend the day can't be beat.   It's much easier and less stressful than having to lug that heavy board several blocks between cars and other beachgoers.</Review>

Great experience. Kris was prompt, friendly and helpful with getting setup. He even helped me carry the paddle boards down to the water. Thanks for the good time on the water! I will definitely comeback when I want to hit the bay again!< /Review>

We had an amazing experience in San Diego paddle boarding in Mission Bay with our 3 kids. This company was very professional and met us with paddle boards and life jackets and on time and very friendly ! Highly recommended! No hassle with filling out forms and showing id's. Simple!< /Text>

<review>Called last minute and these guys made it happen, hooked me up with a nice board and were awesome and super easy to get in contact and work with. They are definitely the people to rent from, they even offered to help hook me up with a board of my own so I'll be contacting them again soon!<//review><Rating>5</Rating>< GmapID>

<text>Awesome company to work with. A group of my friends were in town for a long weekend bachelor party and wanted to rent some SUPs. They delivered the board to us within ~15 minutes. After we were done they came for pickup in about the same time frame. Great prices, great service, and the equipment was in good shape. 10/10 or 5 stars - Would recommend.< /text>< Pictures>

Kris is so nice and easy to get a hold of for reservations. He brought the paddle boards right to the park so it was a short walk to the water. The bay is a great place to learn how to paddle board and hui hui is a great place to rent equipment!<//Text>

Nice to see an old Sizzler around here.  The pandemic has made them close down their salad bar, but we go here for the steak.  The managers here buy good steaks , the meat is high quality.  The New York and Prime rib were very tasty .  I just wish they had mash potatoes.  Garlic mashed potatoes instead of just fries .< /Review>

Is it too much to ask for olive oil and balsamic vinegar?  Apparently it is because only some sort of red vinegar and soy bean oil was offered.  There were a variety of other dressings, but I was looking for the healthiest option.  The mash potatoes was cold on arrival.  The clam chowder was just meh.< /Text>

It's been awhile since I've even seen a Sizzler! I had to stop in for a Malibu Chicken... I took it to go & it was really good! Hostess who took my order was very nice & surprised to receive a tip. Please, tip your to-go orders - they have to do almost as much work as if you were eating inside. #PSA< /Review>

The meal I ordered was very good, the presentation was nice. Not very crowded for that time of the day. Parking is rather tight because it's located in a small shopping center with small shops and fast food restaurants. So parking may or may not be available.< /text>

The waiter stood guard at the salad bar! Who does that? Funny, the managers sit in the back office watching cameras. Are people really stealing food?  Adult guests at an adjacent table were denied a separate plate for their bread. They were not on a date!
The Hayward location is worth the drive for quality and service.<//Review>

This location has been around for many years and is still one of the better Sizzler locations in the Bay Area. The salad bar is well stocked and clean, the kitchen items are cooked well and they still bring out cheese toast every time we go without us having to ask for it.< /Review>

The customer service was not great. Their over change you on the food. For instead they  charge you for  6oz steak for $22 .99 when it said you get 8oz steak for $22.99. I got a 6oz steak for$22.99 instead of$12.99, they put your food in a cardboard box to go and change you 10 cent a bag. I had photos but I just delete them today.< /review>

I haven't been to sizzler in years. But I loved it so much  In the past that in on Easter I searched high and low and drove way out to San Leandro from San Francisco to find one. To make a long story short I was quite surprised by how  Expensive they had became!  Unfortunately the food quality was very poor. I won't be going back. Sincerely disappointed.

<Text>First time I have been in a Sizzler in at least 15 years. And this one was very good. The food was good, the service was good, and the prices are competitive. The menu options have changed somewhat over the last 15 years, but the quality is still there. My grandmother and I used to always go to Sizzler in San Jose California. It was one of her favorite places to dine. And I had good memories having dinner there and reminiscing about my grandmother's days.</Text><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None< /resp>< GmapID>

I was so happy when I seen a sizzler at san leandro since I love the one in colma. The salad bar was terrible and the food was cold. Bad service... our waitress only came once with clean plates. We never got ask if we wanted a refill or more bread.< /text>

<review>Food was horrible. Service was ok.

Chef needs to learn what a medium steak looks like.
Frozen chicken? Nasty. Please make your food fresh, even if the portion is small.
Crispy shrimp, to hard overcooked.<//review>< Pictures>

<Text>Dining room had a section in pretty significant need of repair. They have caution tape to cordone off the area. The salad bar is pretty small for the price IMO. NOT a fan of needing the wait staff to bring me a clean plate when I'm ready to go get more... Almost felt like begging for a new plate to be brought. My young child was pretty rowdy and it appeared as though the wait staff was annoyed because they continually offered a high chair and even at one point said "he needs a high chair." No - children this age like to climb and a high chair would have him screaming and trying to climb out/fall to the floor.<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

It almost made a 4 Stars except for the following.:  1.  The  Cashier had just taken the Couple ahead of us, then she left.  She did not say sorry I'll be right back or ask someone to help take our order.  We waited and waited,  my Husband and Son wanted to leave.   Finally a Lady Manager went by and I asked for help.  Our food is served but where is our Cheese Toast.   Ask our Waiter twice no toast.   Ask the bus boy,  no toast.   Finally got it.  Ask for a container to take leftover Steak.   Never received it.   Salmon ok but a wee bit dry.  Everything else good< /Review>

<review>They were training a new employee and she didn't really know how to use the cash register in placing the order. Even when we were specific in the order she didn't get it right.

<review>Me And Aunts water was over worked with
4 people ...
Reason being I got the salad bar.
I had to wait 5 to 10inutes to get a plate
To go back up and re fill my plate
The food was plentiful since no patrons
It was right after the lunch crowd .so all was fresh< /review>< GmapID>

<Text>The only thing I dislike about this place is how long I end up waiting at the front to get seated. You order and pay before you sit to eat, and they generally only have 1 person taking the food and drink orders plus accepting cash. I enjoy the salad bar a lot! Good amount of parking available.</Text>< pictures>

<Review>I really like Sizzler! I know not to order the lobster because its not one of their specialty dish & its usually chewy but other than that I enjoy the food especially the salad bar. I'll take Sizzler over Hometown Buffet any day.</Review>< Rating>

Fast, friendly servers. Hot and tasty, as well as, cool and refreshing options for the salad bar. I would have given them 5 stars but they're soft serve machine was down the last time.</Text>

First of all the young girl at the counter that took our order needs to  NOT work the register. She does not smile or look at you, she is not very hospitable or inviting to customers. She forgot one our 5 drinks. Then we had to wait for our garlic toast. My Mom's steak was hard and burnt,  we had to get up and ask for our server Everytime ! We had to ask for plates! Just very BAD< /review>

I had a horrible experience with Sizzles yesterday, I went in for a steak and lobster, my steak was just fine but my lobster was nasty and smelled really bad. At first I thought maybe it's just me but then after taking home my leftovers I realized it's was definitely something not right about that lobster. What a waste of money, time and gas. This is usually my go to place for lunch but not sure if I will be returning to this particular location.< /text>

I have not had dinner here before so I was really confused.  Had to order right when you come in and I didn’t like that because I wasn’t sure what they had.  I felt rushed so I just picked something.  My dinner was good and filling.  I hade the steak and baked potato.  I have a hard time finding a good steak since I eat mine well done.  I usually only eat ribeye.  I didn’t try the salad bar because I felt rushed   My friend had the salad bar and everything she had looked good. Next time I will look up the menu before I go.  The waitress was nice but a little busy. We waited a while for our drinks but it wasn’t a big deal because she was trying. I will give it another try and update my review.  I looked at the menu board a little after we sat down and seen several things I would like to try.<//review>

<Review>Ever wonder what it'd be like if 7-Eleven opened a restaurant? Wonder no more, this place is basically it.

Sure my expectations were low going in... well they dropped further once my chicken sandwich arrived. A SMALL piece of fatty processed chicken on a bun. Seriously!? And not even decent processed chicken! Wow! Never again< /Review>< Pictures>

This place is cool because I can get a decent meal here that doesn't break my bank. The salad bar is my fav. I could  eat here 7 days in a row and never have the same thing twice!   Nice!</review>

The service is horrible and the food is not much better. It's serviceable if you aren't close to a sweet tomatoes. Not to mention the surrounding neighborhood isn't the best. San Leandro is doing a lot to try to revitalize their downtown but still has a ways to go.</Review>

The food was not worth $35 for 2 people just for the salad bar. Not many good tasting items either. The best thing there was the chicken soup so thank god i went there not too hungry. I just wanted to provide a place that had salads for my girlfriend and she too was not pleased.its an ok place if someone else's buying you lunch but if your looking for a great tasting meal for 35 bucks,I suggest you save it for a better restaurant. I gave the 2 stars for the chicken soup btw.< /Review>

<Review>Sizzler's in San Leandro Plaza I ordered us steak and all you can eat shrimp the only problem is the state tasted funny so I sent it back then when they brought me a brand new steak and I want to cut it all the blood was just rain running out so I asked my money back it's a good place to go when you have family gatherings and stuff like that with the kids but just make sure that when you order a steak it doesn't smell four tastes funny<//Review>< user_id>

Ok so it's Sizzler. Food was fine. Devon at the counter, also fine. Minor thing: asked what to drink, I responded, "water, bubbly if you have it (as a lot of fast casual places now do)." Seated at the table, I see on my receipt I was charged almost three bucks for the water. I brought the bubbly water back to Devon without touching it, saying, you know, that's kind of a lot; I'll just have tap. I'm cool about it, he's cool about it, but it was an ordeal getting my card credited. Which it never was. I was charged $37, and then $34 again.
A manager (named Cho) happened to come by and cleared my salad plate, and asked me if everything was good. I responded "No."
She asked, "No?"
I again responded, "No."
Now it got strange. She walked away, never to return. I asked Devon on the way out whether I could speak to a manager. He explained that Cho was the manager. In fact he called her the owner. I was skeptical, but asked if I could speak to her again to resolve the double charge, and he replied that she was too busy.
I left, and tried calling the restaurant on my way home to see if I could be connected with anyone who could rectify the charge. I was connected with Cho. I'll spare you the details, but the conversation was theater of the absurd, and I remain overcharged. A call to Sizzler has gotten no response.
Bottom line: food here is fine, but good luck if anything goes wrong.<//text>

We weren't acknowledged for a while although manager was infront of us. Part of the restaurant was close. Smell bad like mold had a whole in the ceiling and a broken wall like a car crashed onto it.< /Review>

< review>
Waiter forgot what table ordered what. Actually set my food in front of another customer who picked a french fry off the plate before he realized his mistake. Then he picked it up and brought it to ny table. Was a little surprised he didn't take it to the kitchen.</review>

<review>This is Not the usual Sizzler salad bar they are known for ☹️ very disappointing definitely not half the size as  the one in Winton Ave. I wonder is it the same price at both places?< /review>< Time>

(Translated by Google) I especially like this place, to the point of going almost once a week.
The cuts are good and at a great price, especially the Ryb Eye, compared to other sites.
I do not recommend the lobster, it's a very small portion.
The salad bar complies and is tasty.
They serve you very well. The bread with garlic is good good.

(Original)
Este lugar en especial me gusta bastante, al grado de ir casi una vez a la semana.
Los cortes son buenos y a muy buen precio, en especial el Ryb Eye, en comparación con otros sitios.
La langosta no la recomiendo, es una porción muy chica.
La barra de ensaladas cumple y es sabrosa.
Te atienden muy bien. El pan con ajo es bueno bueno.</Text>
