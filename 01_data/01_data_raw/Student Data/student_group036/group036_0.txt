I own an electric Smart car and had issues in the past bringing my car to Riverside for service.  I'm so happy I discovered Exotic Car Service.  My car is now as good as new.  Their quote, time estimate, and overall competence sold me.  Awesome experience!</Review>

I have an air-conditioning leak that we are waiting for the day to show us where The leak is.
What really stands out to me is the honesty of the group of guys at the shop.
A few hours after I dropped the car off I reached in my pocket to tip the waitress at coffee and I realized my roll of  cash wrapped in a rubber band, about $1500, was missing.
I called the shop to see if by chance they happen to have found a roll of cash laying on the ground.
As expected of course they haven’t found a big wide of cash.
An hour or two later they called me back and informed me that the light guy found my wad of cash laying on the ground.
Pretty rare to find find honesty like that these days they will be my go to shop for sure<//text>

I am extremely satisfied with Exotic Car.  From my very first call to drop off and pick up I was timely and accurately communicated with. Staff is friendly and professional. Quality work for reasonable price.   My car was even washed for pick up. I will continue to drive the 45 minutes to drop off my cars. So happy I discovered Exotic Car Service.</Review>

I was in Florida shopping for a car located in Cathedral City. I called to see if they did pre-purchase inspections. They did. For the full one ... it was pricey. However, their careful attention to detail and their thoroughness of the inspection revealed some serious flaws in the vehicle, which I brought to the attention of the Lexus dealer selling the vehicle. Their thorough service and excellent communication throughout the process gave me confidence in my decisions on that vehicle. I avoided an expensive mistake thanks to their efforts. I would like to especially thank Katrina (I hope I spelled that right).< /review>

I found this business through a Google search during my quest to locate an independent car care service for my British roadster.  With highly rated reviews, and an informative website, I called and made an appointment.   Phone was answered immediately and welcomingly.  I had an appointment within a couple of days and the service I requested was completed to my satisfaction—and on time.  While my car was in their possession, I had two phone calls from the owner keeping me informed on what they found and how they could resolve.  Since that appointment, I’ve spoken to a couple of acquaintances who also happen to be very happy with Exotic Car Service.  I’m delighted to have found them and pleased to support a local small business.< /Text>

<text>I just moved to the Desert from Northern California. I was surprised to learn that no Smart car dealerships were local. Nearest service center is Riverside. I asked another smart car owner where he serviced his smart car, and he recommended exotic car services. I scheduled an appointment and took my car there for service. I was pleasantly surprised that it was a Family owned business for over 30 years.  I had my 70,000 mile maintenance completed and asked for a complete check on any other issues that might be needed. Alan, the owner pointed out a couple of other items that needed to be addressed, and they were completed Fast and efficiently. Some items were identified and corrected,  and I was not charge for the service. Very pleased and happy to know there is a local family owned service center that can take care of my car needs. I also took my Porsche Panamera for a 80,000 mile service and  I am completely satisfied with The results. I paid half price that the Porsche dealership charges. I would definitely recommend this facility to anyone looking for a Repair shop that has great workmanship, and great customer service.<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

I own a 2004 911 and recently moved from Minnesota where I had a great relationship with my previous independent garage. After reading the reviews from a number of local independents, I opted to bring my car to Exotic Car Service for an oil change, brake job, and new tires. I could NOT be happier about that decision. Al was absolutely FANTASTIC during the entire process from quoting to completion. On time, on budget, and, thanks to post-work car wash, my car was as shiny as the day she rolled off the production line. Thank you, Al, and thank you Exotic Car Service!!!</Text>

<text>Being new to the area I had a very unpleasant experience with the Cat City chevy dealership repair facility. So when my sister was visiting and her smart car air conditioning quit working i was reluctant to use anyone, but thankfully i took a chance on Exotic and we were presently surprised at the service we received. Their quote was reasonable but when we picked it up the cost was less, as it didn't require all they thought was necessary....I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PLACE...VERY PROFESSIONAL...<//text><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>{'time': 1600368687816, 'text': 'Thanks for the great review Phil.

< Review>
Our vehicle had a new battery that AAA had put in for us.  Worked fine for two weeks then we woke up to a dead vehicle again.  We had it towed to Exotic Car service and they did a phenomenal job helping us out.  Took care of the problem completely with great service, a smile and excellent mechanical care.  Thank you for being a repair shop we can trust!< /Review>

Exotic Car Service is awesome!!! I couldn’t be happier I found a place to service my 2007 Range Rover. If you have vehicle problems, call them without hesitation. You will not be disappointed. I’ve lived in the desert for 15 years now and there’s no other shop like this. They are professional, communicative and honest. You can trust that your car will be in good hands.<//Text>

You won't find car service like this anywhere else.  They gonbeyind and above to make sure your needs are met and your car is running perfectly.   Weve been coming to Exotic Car Service for 7 years with different cars weve had over the years and will continue to do so.</Review>

<Text>Our third experience with Exotic Car Service was excellent; a/c service and new tires. Communication is always easy here and what they say is in perfect alignment with what they do...Except for Italian food there are few things better than an honest and 100% dependable place for car service; we recommend Alan and co. without reservation.
Bob and Elley Matthews    August 2020

Having left an excellent mechanic when we moved from Marin, we read every review about nearly every BMW service in the area as we looked for a replacement. We decided to try Exotic Car Service and found their service and communication absolutely outstanding. We had an oil change two days ago (surprisingly inexpensive, especially when considering the inspection that comes with it). A few things were recommended, an appointment was offered for the very next day, and the work was completed ahead of schedule, again, for an amazingly reasonable price. They use original parts and the work is guaranteed. There was no BS, no "sorry we're running late" or misinformation. What REALLY struck us was that they took the time to put our own sun shades on the dash when the car was finished. This simple act of consideration says a lot about not just what they do, but also who they are. We will continue to work with Exotic Car Service and will recommend them without reservation. It's a shame they don't do dental work....Elley and Robert Matthews    Rancho Mirage

Second Visit/Review for Alan at Exotic Car Service
We brought our second car (an 11 year-old 328i) to Alan and co. last week for an oil change. This was our second visit after having experienced excellent, professional and on-time service the first time. A thorough check showed that a few things were needed, among them a new battery. Despite the old battery's age, they spent a fair amount of time to see if we had any warranty left on it, and they were able to apply a few dollars to the cost of the new battery. You do not find this kind of service-for just about anything-very much these days. They kept the car for most of the day and Katrina in the office kept us informed of the time and the cost (very reasonable) throughout the process. They even applied touch-up paint on a very small scratch - at no charge! It is a singular pleasure to be able to rely on someone's word and their work; our review is every bit as genuine as they are. Thank you, Alan, for the excellent and personable service.  Bob and Elley Matthews< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>{'time': 1591240941455, 'text': 'Thank you Elley and Robert.

Big Al / Chris are both personable and professional. Outstanding service at reasonable prices. Fast service, convenient hours and location. Fielded multiple "What if"s" and explained services completely. It was my pleasure dealing with them. Treated my 'older' Land Rover with the same care and attention to detail as much newer/expensive vehicles that they specialize in repairing. Will definitely make the 'drive' from 29 Palms for future service. Thanks Again Al!</Text>

<Review>Truly Family Owned & Operated!!!! I will be forever grateful to Exotic Car Service for helping me with my car. I called based on the reviews, hoping to find someone honest to help me with my car. It had been "fixed" at another shop, but still not working. I was stressed out when I called, asking if they work on Volvo station wagons, and if I could have it towed there... without hesitation Al said, Sure, send it on over. From that minute, I got updates, pleasant phone calls from Chris, emails - letting me know what was going on. There was a lot going on, but they fixed everything. They have an unbeatable warranty, and treat you with kindness if you need to use it. In fact, they are almost happy that you get to use it! I was so relieved to find a place I can trust, I take my care there for my oil changes, as well. My mom was so impressed with how my car turned out, she has switched from the local Ford dealer to Exotic Car Service. For those of us in the world who are not mechanically inclined.... You can trust this shop. In over 20 years in the desert, this is truly the first time I can say that about a place that fixed my car. Thank you!!!!!!!!!! :) for everything you do!< /Review>< Pictures>

Own two exotic cars, Rolls Royce and Jaguar. Have had many so - called experts work on the cars.
None come close to the quality of service and attention my cars receive. Yes, I could take both of them to dealers who would and have gotten the job done, but at 150% of what I pay at Exotic Car Service.
The mechanics are all top drawer, knowledgeable and certified. The only place I would ever take either of my exotics.< /review>

< review>
We couldn't be happier with the service we received from Exotic Car Service. It's great to find a place to work on your car & not have to worry about getting taken' to the cleaners.  Our S55 never ran so well! Thank you Alan.< /review>

If you have a Smartcar, this is THE place for repair and maintenance in the Coachella Valley. They're recommended by other shops in the area who don't work on Smarts.

Exotic was effective and surprisingly affordable - since they actually got the job done quickly. They were able to fix an ignition problem other shops couldn't, mainly because they are savvy and talented.< /Review>

<text>The best Independent European Car Mechanic in the whole Coachella Valley, hands down. I've tried them all and none have offered the same level of knowledge, kindness, and professionalism that I encountered at Exotic Car Service. They know everything about Mercedes-Benz/AMG vehicles, as well as Jaguar, Rolls Royce, Bentley, BMW/M.. the list goes on. If you have a performance vehicle with a hand built engine, you need to go to a place you can trust not to scam or fool you, I finally found that place. My C55 AMG hasn't felt this great in over 2 years! Do not hesitate to give them a chance with your maintenance needs. Thanks again for everything Alan and Crew!!< /text><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>{'time': 1555006495021, 'text': 'Thanks for the kind review.  look forward to seeing you at your next service with your Rolls Royce, Bentley or BMW.

< Review>
This is the place. If you want to treated with respect. Have highly trained technicians evaluate your
car. Be given a reasonable quote for repair. Save some money. Try this service out. They are fooling around. Most mechanics will deceive you and try to charge you more than is required. These guys Al and Scott are the best. They helped me save a whole lot of money. Gave me options for future issues. My car came back repaired, at a much lower cost than I had expected. They washed my car, reset the clock even. If you want to have no regrets with your choice in auto repair. You will be glad you took you car to them. My mercedes e class has never driven better. Most importantly they gave me intelligent conversation about the repair and future repair I might need. I saved money and left with a smile. These guys are the greatest. Will always take my cars to them. thanks scott and al< /Review>

<Review>Just had the brakes done(new rear drums and all wheel cylinders) and the front end rebuilt (king pins) then alignment on my 63 VW Panel.   Have been using this shop for over 30 years for all my vehicles and have never come away disappointed.   Their quality of workmanship is outstanding and their pricing is excellent.< /Review>< Pictures>

Sam’s is the most honest, friendly and knowledgeable business I have ever found. I’ve had many cars and tried many mechanics and shops but opted not to use them due to sketchy service and workmanship. Mostly I did my own work due to this but with Sam’s I have had more than a few very good experiences with different jobs from a 5 minute job to a lengthy complicated repair.</Text>

<Time>1573089918652< /Time><rating>5</rating><Review>I had just spent 900 on tires so I decided it would be wise to get an alignment. As he was doing the work he found a shock that was leaking and quoted me 270 to change both fronts. I called the dealer and with the warranty I bought they changed both shocks for a 50.00 deductible but before that I called 2 other shops to get a quote and the cheapest was 350 and the other one wanted 400. My truck tracks perfectly now and I'm happy I found an honest repair shop that will treat me fairly.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

One of the best experiences I’ve ever had involving cars. Usually I get over priced and someone who doesn’t know what they are doing. Very good work and honest which is golden in this Industry. I would recommend this shop to anyone who needs alignment or brakes.< /review>

I've been going to this shop for over 10yrs, and will continue going to them for life.. I am very very pleased with their work, from modified cars to bone stock cars and their alignments are far more superior than any other shop I've ever been to.  Thank you guys☻😎<//Text>

They did a great job i felt a difference as soon as I got into my truck and for 50 bucks not bad at all they did the job quick too. Also said they would check my alignment in Three months for free too</review>

Trust them-We put our life and family in the hands of the guys who keep breaks working -even on our broken cars. For years they have been honest, hard workers at lower end of  fair price. Worth finding this shop, and making it your family car place.and ONLY fix your breaks and alignment and a break shop! Be safe.</text>

<Review>Do yourself a favor and just get a frozen pizza or put sauce and cheese on a tortilla! Whatever you do it will be better than this pizza. Salad and appetizer was not good at all as well. Avoid Straw Hat I really wanted it to be good.< /Review>< pictures>

Visited for the first time, food was okay. Service was okay as well. Nothing impressive yet, they’ve only been open for a little while.  They do have a nice bar inside and Patio seating.  I think this place has potential to be great! I think they are are still working out the kinks of being a new restaurant.  So if you visit, don’t be upset if things don’t go smoothly.  We will visit again and hopefully upgrade my rating.  Also, would you please add milk to he kids menu? Thank you 😊< /Review>

<text>The pizza was great but service was at an all time low. There was only a handful of customers but the staff had little urgency to serve anything. After waiting 20+ minutes for the check, we had to go ask if we could pay it. I also think that there may be some new owners based on this experience. Went here 3 months ago when they were doing outside dining and was a totally different place. Hopefully it improves.< /text><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None</resp><GmapID>0x80945de2258fe75d:0x296d0ae6436261f8</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

However, one time I went on a Sunday night to get drinks with my friends, but they didn’t have anyone to bartend! They have a full bar, but no one that could make my friends and I drinks. Also, we got wings, and I swear there was blood in them- each one! This place should be super busy, but the lack of service and consistency is such a turn off. Management needs to turn it around.</text><rate>3<//rate>< Name>

<Rate>5</Rate><review>I don't do a lot of reviews but I had to jump on here to give my review about this place. I haven't been in the restaurant due to covid but have passed it many times. I did an order on door dash and was very very impressed. I got the garlic Parmesan groove twists along with the ham and cheese hot hat. Wow! Amazing, loved every bite. I can't wait for my boyfriend to try this place. Even their fries on the side were delicious. Highly recommend if you are on the fence about this place try there hot hats!!< /review>< pictures>

The worst pizza in town.  Go buy a frozen pizza or little Ceasars and save yourself the disappointment and heartache. The cheese tastes fake,  and the sauce is terrible.  The dough could have been anything than what it is and it would have tasted better.  Please do yourself a favor.</Review>

Had the chicken Alfredo to go. Thought the chicken had a little extra  seasoning on one side turns out it was just either freezer burnt or something. called them back, drove down there to get a “fresh” plate.. the food wasn’t good at all, no taste and low quality chicken.< /Review>

<review>Food was great! We sat on the patio and they put misters on for us to make sure it was nice and cool. Staff is friendly and manager is very personable. It was a little slow checking out and paying, but our waitress was still learning the system and we understood. We will absolutely be back.</review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

<Text>This place needs so much help, 40 mins for wings and garlic twists, asked how long for a pizza was told at least 50 mins, say whattt are you kidding me, it takes 10 mins to cook a pizza. I know they opened 5 weeks ago but they should’ve worked out the kinks by now, it took 20 mins for a beer (the bar was busy per my server) look I get it but you only have so many tables outside so what could take a bar tender so long to pour a beer. Maybe it’s staffing maybe, it’s actual leadership idk but I saw a lot of people standing around and a lot of people looking not knowing what they are doing. Good luck Straw Hat Pizza I have you a try but I’m done and won’t be back.< /Text>< userid>

Placed an order for three pizzas.they say 15, so i get Thier and wait another 20 to 25 minutes even though thier was only 4 people who had thier orders. Finally got my order and wings were cold, one pizza had wrong topping on it. The other pizza we paid for an extra topping and they literally put only one mushroom on it. Also  we had to go back in since they forgot the ranch to the wings. lots of tvs and looks like a cool place to eat in though, Im going to give one more try but not with the pizza<//text>

Very stingy on their stuff. They put small pizza instead of individual.  So then they made me wait for individual instead of just giving me the small. Who does that? Really??. Management needs to taking care of customers.</text>

First, they are very unprofessional, the manager or the owner is never attentive. One time I called 53 times and I couldn’t even place her order, I even watched a young lady hang up on someone that called. Today I just ordered, I finally got through to place a phone order and when I came in to pick up my food the young lady,  the Spanish lady who poured my drink didn’t even put the lid on all the way. So, then when I picked up my cup and tried to wipe it off  the soda spilled everywhere. So, then I told her I didn’t  want the soda. I then told her can I be Reimbursed. She said no because I already had a combo and when I asked to speak to a supervisor once again there was nobody available. I called 10 more times after I had to go back and ask for my receipt so I can give a bad review. The food is great. I’m not coming back again, if you can’t even give respect after your combos are almost 10 bucks and not even enough fries, I can’t keep spending my money!< /text>

Their menu is rather large u can get a variety of food from burgers & fries to combination fried rice. I've eaten there 3 times & their food isn't that good the fries r always soggy & bland the chicken wings r the best thing at least to me, however if u r not satisfied with ur food they will make it right. B sure to call & tell them b4 going back to store get the name of whom ever u speak with.</text>

Yuck, never ever buy the veggie fried. Just nasty, it had corn, and no egg. I should've gone to a Chinese food place.</Text>

My daughter loves to go to American deli she loves the service there it's really great and especially their wings and Philly cheese steak sandwich are really good combination and it is really good Right now we have been ordering a lot of takeout food so you Gotta make sure you call within time so they can have your order ready but definitely recommend it< /review>

Had the classic Stromboli... incredible. Boyfriend had the burger... delicious. Hush puppies... amaze. American Deli

A must try. We moaned through the whole meal.

Take it next door to Lucky 13 and eat great food in a dive bar with a killer tap selection.< /text>

My BIGGEST and ONLY problem with American Deli is the fact that MY wings are never ready when I arrive. I still have to wait an additional 10-15 minutes and I find that SUPER annoying especially coming on one of my breaks. When I order and you or Postmates tell me 20 minutes? I EXPECT my wings to be ready upon arrival - don’t start tossing them once I arrive. That’s so irritating.< /Text>

<Review>It’s Unfortunate that they have good wings but their customer service is not good. I called ahead for my order, came in the 25 minutes and my food still wasn’t done. And when I asked is my order ready they told me 5 min...5 min turned into 30 more minutes. They did nothing to expedite my order. They said sorry about 10 times. The manager/owner was there and they did nothing about the issue. They were rude and inconsiderate and I know if they treated me this way they will treat someone else this way. Both the manager and owner was there that’s the crazy part. I would not recommend anyone support this business they do not care about the   Customer.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

You can shake lemon pepper season on your fries they have other flavors like garlic powder and seasoning salt for your fries. Their wings are perfect not over fried or under fried, you also have the option of all wings or all drums. They also sell sandwiches like Philly cheese steaks, chicken burgers fried rice and fish. I love this place y'all</Review>< pictures>

Called 35 min before close and phone disconnected and was told to call ahead next time when we arrived 10 min before close. If you close at 9 should be the time you stop taking orders and be takeout only after 8:30. Wish they had another location near Fontana.<//text><user>112422533289807971102< /user>< Rate>

I was in this location today. No line control. I was outside when they called my number for pickup, when I picked up my order and turned around it was over 10 people in this small location and on top of that someone sneeze took off his mask and started talking on the phone God help me!!!<//review>

<Review>This was a horrible experience. We ordered through grub hub and the restaurant called us to throw the driver under the bus. They said the driver hadn't showed and our food was cold. So, after the delivery driver showed up with our food, she told us the restaurant told her that we called them (so they're liars). We go through the boxes and not only are lamb gyros labeled chicken, we're missing an entire meal. The manager, Pete, dismissed our complaint and told his cashier to handle it over the phone. She decided be very rude and told us that it wasn't their problem, nothing they can do and had the audacity to tell us that we can come to the restaurant and nothing would change. So we went to the restaurant to speak the manager, no one wanted to speak to us and then they tried to blame grub hub. In the end, we didn't get our food and grub hub reimbursed us for the poor customer service we had to endure. Definitely won't be ordering from this place again. Such a disappointment.<//Review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

I'm addicted. They give Wingstop a run for their money. The only thing is the dipping sauce isn't as great as Wingstop. The teriyaki is finger licking good!< /Text>

Ordered through Postmates, however I called American Deli prior to fulfilling my order and the phone customer service was excellent. The wings (Family Gold and Lemon Pepper/Dry Seasoning) were DELICIOUS , Philly Cheese Steak and fries were DELICIOUS, and the Chicken Fried Rice was ok. Definitely will be getting my wings here from now on!< /text>

Small place with nice service. The French fries are whatever but the chicken wings are where it's at. Would definitely come back for the wings. P.s. if you're used to those big steroids injected chicken wings you'll be disappointed when you come here and see the size of there's.</review>

Chili cheese fries were trash. No salt on the fries, the chili looked unappetizing and tasted very bland. Philly cheesesteak was just decent, except the cheese wasn't even melted into the sandwich. It was just a square of room temperature cheese.<//Text>

If it were not for the cheap gas prices that they offe here I think after last night's encounter with the service agent here would definitely make it so that I never come here again..After simply asking whether or not they were closed rather than simply saying yes she snapped  at me and the other two people behind me telling us as if it was our fault for not knowing that they weren't open even though the sign says they were.<//text>

As is the case with all ARCO stations, they don’t take credit cards and charge a debit processing fee. This should be your last choice for getting gas, unless you enjoy using cash...< /Text>

One of the cheaper stations around for gas, but that doesn't help the fact that half of the pumps are faulty and lack maintainence, Out of Order.
The owner isn't always helpful either; I was buying gas one day and had $11 left on the purchase but was running late for work; so I visited the next day with receipt and photo of how much I pumped, but because it was the next day he refused to give me a refund on the $11 or at least to put it into gas to fill up the tank somewhat.
And finally after checking my car I found some water diluted in the gasoline, very risky.</Text>

<review>I brought my MacBook in for repair and they delivered excellent help. I was told by another place my MacBook’s motherboard was done and that the charging port was no good either. I was told by the other guys that I would need a new laptop but since it’s a 2016 I figured it could be fixed. 365 Laptop Repair repaired both issues and had it up and running in no time. Their help was cost effective, professional and informative! Thank you for helping me out and taking the time to try!<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

<text>They quoted a reasonable price and I left my laptop for a new battery.  As I was pulling into the driveway arriving at home, 365 Laptop Repair called to let me know that they had already replaced the battery. Excellent workmanship and repair!< /text></record></dataset><record>

The site says "free ground shipping" on all repairs, but I paid the return shipping cost up front and have to get my own shipping to them. Also the repair I requested (logic board repair) in one section is listed at $249 but $299 on another for the same repair / computer.
I'm sure its still a great service aside from multiple false advertised prices, I asked around for references and read reviews, everyone seems happy. Will update after my machine is returned.<//Text>

<Time>1603481008891< /Time><review>Sadly we got a defective part.  No problem, it happens.

We would absolutely have understood if it had been handled professionally and fairly.  You learn a lot about a company when something goes wrong and in this case they refused to accept a return on a defective part and a replacement with a working part.

I can echo the experience of others who were just placed on hold and ignored.

There are plenty of other places nearby and I'd certainly not trust this company ever again to do the right thing.< /review><user>109106854198852735944< /user><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None</response>< gmapID>

Thank you so much 365! You are way better than Fry’s Electronics and U breakiFix. Came in here to get my laptop fixed cause it got some water damage. They did a diagnostic test and said all it needs is cleaning and to reset the bios. I got my laptop back in two days, but they fixed it within two hours. They charged me 75 bucks for it but I was super happy they got to fix the problem, it was critical to have my laptop back and running. I would recommend this place to anybody.</Text>

Pretty great repair shop. My computer constantly restarted, I tried everything to fix it. Turns out it was localized to my keyboard causing the problem. Thanks to him for identifying that, didn’t even charge me. Good dude, great shop!<//Text>

<Review>Terrible all around. I bring in my laptop on a Monday asking for a diagnosis and service recommendation to an internet connection issue. Guy says no problem. On Tuesday I get an invoice saying my computer is ready to be picked up. I never got the diagnosis results, service recommendations, or the chance to decline said recommendations. I then call to see what's going on, and it turns out they hadn't done anything and it was "accidentally" placed in the completed pile. They agree to get to the bottom of the issue and reverse the invoice. I then get an invoice a few days later. Again, no diagnosis, recommendations, or chance to decline. I come in to pick it up to see what's wrong, and they tell me they ran some tests, and couldn't find out what was wrong other than the hardware was "dusty" so they took an air duster to it. And for this, and the consultation that they don't know what's wrong, I had to pay $50. Not a lot of money, no. But it feels like I literally wasted the better half of a week for nothing, and nothing was ever explained up front, or even afterwards if I hadn't asked very specific questions.< /Review>< gmap_id>

Worse service ever, extremely unprofessional, if there is a problem with an order for your laptop this place will not call you to let you know there is a delay with there order. I order stuff online ALL the time and it surely does not take 2 months to get a part not even if it was from China, and if there was a delay on my order I would get an email stating "my order is being delayed" , if they can't handle the work maybe they should start telling customers that there overwhelmed instead of hanging up on customers and taking up a responsibility they cant handle.</review>

Took my computer in to get looked at. Girl at the front not knowledgeable. Was promised a call at the end of the next day, didn't receive one until 5 days later. I called them after 3 days no answer no voicemail option. Definitely not treated as a priority, seems like they didn't want my business.<//Review>

< Review>
I went to another place in Marina Del Rey but they said that it would take them a week to get a replacement LED screen for my laptop. They told me to call these guys because they had used parts and could fix it after. I called them and they had the part so I drove out to Hawthorne. They said they could replace it in 30 minutes so I walked my dog around the neighborhood, it was super shady. I get back and it was ready. Even though they used used parts it was wore expensive than the shop in Marina Del Rey. It was around 5:00 and when I went to pay I realized I had forgotten my card at home. I asked what time they closed and the guy told me 6:30. I told him I lived in a West LA and that thought I could make it home and back before 6:30. If I couldn't make it I would call and let them know so they didn't wait around. It was rush hour and on my way back the GPS said I'd get there at 6:18. I started to call them at 6pm to tell them I was close but no one answered the phone. Since the guy looked me in the face and told me they closed at 6:30 I hoped they were just helping other people and couldn't get to the phone. I got there at 6:15 and all the lights were out and no one was there. I had raced in rush hour for no reason and the guy had lied to my face. I'm worried that I won't be able to get my computer tomorrow. While I was waiting to be helped a women was complaining that she was having problems that were supposed to have been fixed on a previous visit. I'm worried that they are one of those places that cause problems so that they can take advantage of people and make more money. They are clearly dishonest people and have had access to my personal information on my computer. I'm quite honestly terrified and I don't know if I should cancel my cards.<//Review>

After being quoted $500 to replace my Lenovo Yoga 2in1 Screen by a BigBox store I found 365 Laptop repair. I was in LA on business, they didn't have the screen in stock but got it within a few days and shipped my laptop back to me at No additional Cost! Using it right now, Fixed Perfectly for almost 1/2 of the Big box cost! Thanks so much guys!!!< /text>

Really great shop!  I ordered a 27" iMac 5k screen from them and they shipped it to me quickly and with the adhesive already applied.  It was a quick and easy install.

I had originally ordered a screen from eBay, but it turned out not to be an original Apple screen.  The resolution was 4k instead of 5k!  I was pleasantly surprised when I saw the screen from 365 was supplied by LG (the same vendor that Apple uses) and it had the correct 5k resolution.</text>

Looked at many options to fix the motherboard on my Surface Pro 4 since Microsoft would only take my device and send me someone else's refurbished one for $450. (They won't try to recover your files either.) I found 365 Laptop Repair's youtube channel first (thought about fixing it myself and their youtube channel had instructions.) So glad I decided to have them fix it instead. Took a little longer than expected (only a week) but I was in no rush since my Pro 4 had been dead for months.  Great service and friendly staff. Couldn't beat the price to get it fixed either! Highly recommended if you have a Microsoft Surface to get it fixed here. I was able to keep all my files too! I will definitely return with any other issues I have with my Surface.<//Text>

No Complaints: Fast, Efficient, Competent. I discovered them from a YouTube video on how to disassemble a Vaio Flip laptop and another one to replace the screen. The videos were well produced and very instructive but I decided to have them do the repair because they seemed to have the replacement screen in stock and the know how.

They diagnosed the problem and had it fixed in a few hours.. They seemed aware that getting the job done quickly is important to some users.< /Review>

<review>I had called and visited other repair places. 365 was referred to me by a place who didn't have the parts for my Lenovo. It was coming apart because screws had come out of the back. Isaac took my computer to the back room and came out 10 minutes later with everything good as new. If I'd left my laptop anywhere else, they would have had it for probably 3-7 days. This place seems to have every part you could possibly need. Isaac was friendly and very professional.

<Text>I had a non working display on Yoga 2 Pro (with touch screen). I paid online and sent it in. I received an email telling me they had received it, another when they started repairing it, another when the repair was completed and another when the laptop shipped. I had scheduled and paid for a two-day return but they sent it ONE-day and it arrived back in my hands by the afternoon of the next day. It worked perfectly and the repair was done expertly with no damage to the casing. Great work and extremely great timing (they received it, fixed it and and shipped it the same day). I shipped it on Tuesday for two-day delivery on Thursday and got it back in my hands by Friday in the same week.<//Text>< time>

<review>Found this repair shop online because I couldn't find anyone locally to fix my Lenovo Yoga 900 screen.  Prices were very fair and the process for repair was very easy.  The repair service took less than a day, and I had my laptop back after the repair in 2 days.  Greatest thing is that they use OEM parts, so I don't have to worry about some cheap aftermarket part. Highly recommended, even if you are way in the mid-west like me.</review><pictures>None< /pictures>< user>

<review>They did their best to help me in the end maybe. Thank you, it's working ALMOST but not best as it should have been now, a few small issues such as the touch screen and camera and lag,  id just advise against buying a computer from them ive been regretting it an should have bought a new one. they do their job fixing it later but at a somewhat hefty price after a while. 7/10 for service effort but 5/10 for their used computer integrity at least in my case unfortunately.</review><pics>None</pics><response>{'time': 1481858497523, 'text': 'We tried to look you up in our system and can not find your order or your name?

<Response>None<//Response><Text>Went to this place after being fed up with the Geek Squad at Best Buy who took a week to tell me they couldn't do anything. If you want the full story you can read below, but the short version is that the guys at 365 Laptop Repair were able to fix my problem in 5 minutes. I got my computer back with a new piece and went on my merry way all for free. Never going back to Geek Squad again; it's like going to the DMV. These guys care about you and their work.

My Story:
My cat snapped one of my keyboard keys off (which I wasn't able to self repair) and I brought my laptop initially to the Best Buy Geek Squad for what I thought would be a quick fix as I had all the parts. Literally in front of me I watched them drop the pieces to the ground and lose one of them. They would guarantee me they would fix the keyboard and at the very least send it in to replace the keyboard ( 2 weeks) because they had a contract with MSI. They made me back up my computer ahead of time because they said they may wipe my computer (for a keyboard piece)...They promised to call me in 24 hours to give me an update which I never received. I tried to call for two days buy unable to get through to anyone. Needless to say I had to personally walk into best buy three days later (and wait an hour to talk to someone) to find out they hadn't fixed the problem and that they actually couldn't send my keyboard in because they didn't have a contract with "my" MSI computer.

After retrieving my computer I took it to 365 and walked straight up to the counter. They took my computer and even though they couldn't fix it with the original parts(because Best Buy lost them), they found a replacement part that looks almost identical. They also offered to get the whole keyboard in 2-3 business days. best part is that they did this all for free. Love these guys.< /Text><UserId.>103198915619156533622</UserId.></record>

<Text>Laptop power jack was failing. Called around to a bunch of places all of which were more expensive and had a wait. These guys got back to me, said they could do it while I wait for $89.  They did what they said. And they have a great selection of products for sale as well at excellent prices. I've already recommended them to my coworkers.

Wonderful place! Great customer service, friendly, knowledgeable, and extremely personable people that are completely genuine. I went in to have my DC Jack fixed, and it was ready in a couple of hours. When I went to get it, we checked to make sure all the bells and whistles were working before I even walked out the door.

We noticed a problem that went unnoticed before since it hadn't been properly charged in a while, and Brandon was more than happy to give one more good once over to get it fixed; same day service, saved and secured everything. I especially loved how understanding they were with the issues we ran into with the laptop, like if it was there own property.

I highly reccomend this place without hesitation, and know I have a reliable place to turn to if I should struggle with anything pc related!</Text>

These guys helped me to repair a damaged screen on my Lenovo Yoga.  I ordered a replacement screen and it was broken on delivery.  After a few email exchanges I knew they didn't really want to eat the cost and swap it out for me but they did.  They exchanged it with a new one and I was able to follow their youtube videos to replace the screen.  I was really appreciative of the help and how they trusted me as a client. This is my main work computer.  I'm on it 12-16 hrs/day and I was able to get the job done with only an hour or so of downtime.  Thank you guys.< /review>

<review>AMAZING! These guys are the real deal!!! I use my macbook all day everyday as a work machine, it is how I pay my mortgage. I cracked my screen and figured if I was lucky I would be without my macbook for a week. I live in Connecticut, so I fedex next day air'd by macbook to 365laptoprepair. Next day I receive an email that they received my laptop an hour later another email that it was being repaired 2 hours later an email that it was fixed another hour later it had shipped with fedex next day air tracking. Next day I get to the office around noon and WHAM!!! there it is, perfect, all set, no issues. These guys are amazing, highly recommended!<//review>< pictures>

Love this Theatre! Its all about old movies and classics. Very unique and comfortable setting. The  staff is great and the owner is very nice too. His knowledge of old movies must be incredible, what an interesting person.<//review>

Date night with my boyfriend! The seats, blankets and decor ate just awesome. My boyfriend and I got red vines, peanut M&Ms and watched Roman Holiday. It was such a fun experience. I am such a huge Audrey fan, & this was such a great place to watch an Audrey movie 😍< /review>

<Review>This should be a local gem. It has all the hallmarks of something that could be great, but it falls short enough to be a simply average experience and one I would not recommend during the pandemic due to employees alternating between wearing masks ineffectively around their chin and not wearing them at all.<//Review>< Response>

<review>As someone from Europe, I won't be amazed by the age of the theatre (the poor thing isn't even a 100 years old), but the ambiance itself is amazing. They do a great job with broadening the platform of film, and giving the little man a chance - you don't have to make a blockbuster to be inspiring.< /review><GmapID>0x80d954d4932d14c3:0x5c9109628c85c970</GmapID>< Name>

<Text>Best movie theater ever! Clean, nice seats with lots of legroom, delicious caramel popcorn and sour cream and onion popcorn!  You can reserve your seats and buy tickets online. They have special events sometimes and Tops Presents members get invites. I got to see the premiere of Okja and the Director and Steven Yeun did Q&A after! Not bothered by the Korean subtitles on American movies, not one bit.<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None< /response><gmap_id>0x80d954d4932d14c3:0x5c9109628c85c970</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

It was really fun to cuddle under the stars and watch a good old movie. We watched Indiana Jones and Raiders of the Lost Ark. It was a really fun experience with really fun stuff and a great atmosphere!<//review>< Pictures>

<text>The staffing was great. The chairs were comfortable and they gave you a pillow and blanket to use. Not sure how i felt about that since we did that in high shcool and lice got spread around. The whole point of going here was to watch a movie under the stars but they kept us covered the whole time and really took away from the experience. I could understand if it was raining but it was a clear night.</text>< username>

Nice and cozy during the cooler months, nice and breezy during the warmer months.  They have anti gravity chairs and serve snacks at a decent price (not outrageous prices like big movie theaters).

<review>Perfect date spot. Movie dates normally aren't the best dates because you want to talk to one another but this venue screams romance. They have snacks and beverages for you to buy and your movie tickets gives you discounts to stores and select bars in the area for before the move or after. You need to reserve online but pay in CASH when you get there. They do a cute preview of something before the feature film. It's certainly outdoors but they provide a blanket. The only negative is the chairs weren't too comfy even with the chairs they provide and they made a lot of noise. Also, if you mean back and find the right spot, you'll slowly keep reclining back. I had to adjust a lot during the movie and the chair noise was a bit of a nuisance.</review><pictures>None</pictures>< Rate>

Its a bit pricey, but a really good experience. It looks like my dad built it out of his garage with only what he had laying around, except he did a really good job.< /Review>

<Review>Kitschy theater outdoors with beach chairs. Completely covered, so no stars. I get the any weather advantage of the roof - but it was a buzz kill. Heated and blankets so cozy, but expensive and again - no stars. Meh. Done it.< /Review>< username>

< Review>
We've been going to CUTS for several years now and have probably seen 10-15 movies there. The experience is generally good; however, it can be hit or miss depending on the crowd. The price of the tickets tends to keep out most of the riff-raff; however, we have had some noisy individuals next to us at a few of the shows. For the price of the tickets, it can be frustrating when your neighbors talk through the entire movie, or come in drunk from the restaurant next door. Personally, I prefer the cafe loveseats in the back, as the zero gravity chairs give me a headache. Tickets used to be $15, but are now $18 online, which is pretty steep considering the age of most of the movies. Add in a hot chocolate and some popcorn, and you're at about $50 for two people. Despite the price, the theater still appears to sell out most nights. We've become more inclined though to go to the drive-in, or catch the same old movies on Netflix or Amazon Prime.</Review>

Tons on gang members drinking, smoking drugs and peddling for cash here. Littering, and police near by don't do a thing. Even worse affecting the Library.< /text>

<rate>3<//rate><Review>(Translated by Google) This place has improved a little in terms of hygiene and safety but it lacks more view. The thing is that it is the only one that we have nearby and we have to go, I would like more security and sight for, it has its products and cons, eye is my personal point of view, without offending anyone

Very professional and responsive to clients’ needs. Online communication and transactions are very safe and convenient right now. I didn’t have to travel from Oakland to San Jose to complete my income taxes, every thing was completed online. I recommend Sunrise Tax Pro Services since I have been a client for years.< /Text>

We needed the rooftop  HVAC unit  and duct system inspected and problems diagnosed. Everyone who assisted us was professional, helpful and pleasant.

Response was very timely and tech, Jose Rivera, called to let us know that he was on his way. He arrived during time frame given by the great scheduler, Ben.

Tech, Jose, was masked and followed strict Covid 19 protocol.

He did a very thorough inspection, was kind enough to take pictures and send them to my email , and explained everything well.

The price for the inspection was very fair.

My partner and I were very pleased with the service from Canoga Park Heating and Air and rate them 5 stars.<//text>

< Review>
I had Canoga Park Heat & Air at my house last Friday. My heater was making a strange noise I’d never heard before. The technician’s name was Johnny and he was a pleasure to deal with. He said it wouldn’t hurt to let the issue go for the summer and revisit it come fall. He could have said anything really. I will definitely be using them again.< /Review>

Kevin was great!  He was very quick and understood that me working from home means he has to be very quiet while I was on a Zoom meeting.  He worked with my meetings to get everything taken care of without disrupting my work day.  Thanks Kevin!< /Text>

My maintenance service visit was  thorough and as always, Jose was courteous and helpful. He alerted me to a part that might need replacing in the future, but did not pressure me at all to take action until it was necessary. I appreciate that tremendously.</Review>

<review>We are very happy with the service provided by Johnny from Canoga Park Heating & Air Conditioning. Our AC was acting weird so we scheduled a service call. Johnny inspected the device and informed us that our thermostat was not working properly. Johnny installed the Nest thermostat and it is working beautifully. Johnny is very professional and extremely knowledgeable. Thank you!!< /review>< Pictures>

We just had a routine heating and air conditioning maintenance visit with Johnny. He came with the appropriate PPE and did a thorough job checking our system. Johnny is very knowledgeable, detailed and patient. He always takes the time to explain everything and answer any questions we may have regarding our large systems. We highly recommend Johnny and all of the Canoga Park HVAC team. The Canoga Park office staff, technicians, install teams, really every person we have worked with has always been professional, knowledgeable, kind, and nice! The world would be a happier more peaceful place if there were more people like the Canoga Park team!< /Review>

They've been my go to for twenty+years

Turns out my combo heat and AC unit was 29 years old.  They maintained it so well. As it was time to replace it,  Dave came out,  chose the best one,  great price,  for my house.  They were perfect,  everything clean and did an amazing job.  The unit is incredible!<//Review>< pictures>

We have old units (1979 and 1986) and they've had no issue fixing them for us. We had Dave out today to give us an estimate on a new air conditioner and furnace. He was on-time, professional and the price was fair. We highly recommend Dave and this company.

After getting quotes from 3 different HVAC companies, we decided to contract with Dave at CPHAC for new Carrier furnace and AC equipment. We are very happy with the work done. Dave was super quick on getting back to us on questions we had both before and after the job was done.<//Review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

As it was it explained to you, two units were checked and the estimate given was to repair both units in your commercial space. The technician left everything as found until proper approval was given, nothing was sabotaged. It is very easy for another company to put a bad name on any previous contractor trying to impress customers to get the job. The technician did leave the switch off as the unit was not working properly to prevent further damage to your system. It is disappointing to see this review after it was fully explained and seemed to agree.'}< /response><user_id>111377870906323564255<//user_id>< Pictures>

< review>
I am surprised by all the wonderful reviews. We had them come out to check out our unit that was not working. When they completed inspection they said we would need repairs and refrigerant that would cost us $2500+. We we're close to pulling the trigger but decided to get a 2nd opinion. We had another company come out to check the same unit and they questioned if someone had been on the roof already because the power switch was turned off, the caps were missing and apparently they disconnected some wiring to a different unit. These guys tried to come and sabotage us for more money. We did need more of the refrigerant but we did not need any repairs or replacement parts. They probably thought we wouldn't have found out but I am so glad I got a 2nd opinion because these guys tried to screw us!< /review>

<Review>Johnny really helped us out. We were dealing with from our home warranty company putting off completing this job for 6 weeks!  Johnny came out, diagnosed the problem quickly, and was very helpful in giving us the information we needed to submit for reimbursement from the home warranty company. When he returned to actually fix our furnace, he did the job in less than an hour, had all the parts, and was very professional and courteous. 6 weeks of waiting was resolved in less than 2 hours thanks to this company!<//Review>< Pics>

We've had two major A/C systems installed by them at two different properties in the past few years and we're thrilled with them.  They know their stuff!  Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go sit in my perfectly-cooled 75-degree living room while the rest of the city swelters and sweats.</review>

< review>
On this visit, the technician installed a new part (ordered from the manufacturer) which he had diagnosed on a previous maintenance call.  Installation was done without problem; my thermostat "checked" visually as well as internally (on wall); optimal temperature range recommended; next "step up" reviewed and quote given to me.  Cool air was welcomed;  job completed to my satisfaction.<//review>

We understand the needs of every customer should be placed as first priority and working hand in hand always gets the best job done.

Bob was amazing at answering all our questions (and there were a lot).  He was patient and friendly and actually loved the questions and being able to help us get what we needed out of our system.  The installation was seamless, the team was clean with the work they did and didn't leave any kind of mess behind.  I had to delay the fire-up of the system a couple times due to other work being done in the house and Bob and his team were extremely flexible.  I am a tough customer and communication is very important to me.  Bob did not disappoint, his emails and phone calls were right on point.  Our household expect the experts to know their work and we research and check-up on everything we're told.  CPHAC was there 100% with every answer and accommodating every need.  If you want an amazing experience, simply call Bob.  He will get it done!</text>< Date>

<review>Extraordinarily responsive when my elderly mother lost her a/c during a possibly life threatening heat wave in S. CA.  Came the same day to attempt to repair a 15 year-old unit, and were able to schedule a quote and next-day scheduled replacement on an emergency basis.  And...it was a very fair fixed price for everything.  They even provided a portable a/c loaner for her and set it up.  Kudos to Grace and Craig!< /review>< Name>

Canoga Park AC installed my air scrubber during the Porter Ranch methane leak.
Greg replaced the UV light for the scrubber and did my fall heating system check up.  He was on time, wore a mask, and efficiently completed my service.
Please thank your excellent employee for me again.

So far, I got a decent estimate for duct replacement. Waiting to finalize estimate and schedule the job! Duct work was reasonably good.  However,  it took several calls and visits to straighten out a compressed duct in order for it to work correctly.
Technician came same day for heater problem and adjusted the unit so it was able to work again.</Review>

I went on the web site on Sunday morning and messaged them that my air conditioner had stopped working. They got right back to me and put me on the list to call Monday morning. They called Monday morning, made an appointment for early Monday afternoon. The service tech arrived on time and fixed the system. Great explanation of what had failed and what needed to be repaired. The air conditioning is working great now. They also installed the whole air conditioning/heater system 14 years ago and this is the only repair it has needed since that time.<//Review>

< Review>
I purchased my HVAC system from Canoga Park heating and A/C a while ago and they have kept it running perfectly for many years. Of course, after over ten years of no problems, my A/C decided to have a system malfunction, at night, while the weather reports were predicting 100 plus temperatures in two days. I called Canoga Park Heating and A/C in the morning and to my surprise, not only could they come that day, but they would be there by 1pm. We followed their app, knew who was coming and could tell  how far away Kevin was and when he arrived at the house... so we could mask up!  Kevin quickly found the problem, told me the approx. cost, but said it required  parts that might not be in stock. He asked for a minute to check and came back to tell me, not only were the parts in the warehouse, but they were less expensive than he thought. YAY! Then he told me he could pick up the parts first thing in the morning, but had to check the schedule and I should call, if I hadn't heard back by 3pm. I am so sorry I don't remember the name of the woman I spoke to, because she was wonderful. She put me on hold while  she checked with Kevin, and came back to tell me he would be here between 8-8:30am. I was  beyond grateful. Kevin, our super hero,  arrived the next morning, fixed the system in record time and just as the temperature started to rise outside.....The temperature  inside was coming down. I would say that this was the most stress free emergency service I've ever experienced. I have appreciated this company and their regular service for many years, but now I have a whole new appreciation for the service they provide and the wonderful people who make it happen.< /Review>

To begin Craig is not On the list to give a review for. Told him how to get on the roof and after just 10 minutes he came back and said he was ready to show me the quote. I know that he never went on the roof and lied. After I said that other companies said that a 2 ton would be more than enough he said he would not take the job if that’s what I wanted. What company turns down work like that. I asked him about the intake and out take being to small for a 2.5 or 3 ton he said that it does not matter. He seemed to not want this job and did not care at all about anything I would say. I will not call them back.< /review>

<Text>Kevin found the problem with our A/C in minutes. He explained the options we had for repairs, and they had the parts for our 2007-vintage system on the truck.

We asked some not-on-the-order questions about our system (duct/flow issues) and he didn't hesitate to climb in the attic to take a look. Unlike other places we've talked to in the past, there was no pressure to do things that did not need to be done.

Professional, can-do attitude and got results. Highly recommended.<//Text>< time>

Overall we are very happy with the service we received from Canoga Park. They installed an entire new HVAC system to replace our non-functioning evaporative cooler and old furnace.
When Dave came out to give us the estimate he was extremely knowledgable and understood what we were looking for. He was able to get us a great system without taking us over our budget.
Throughout the install the team was very respectful and covid conscious. They cleaned up after themselves before leaving each day.
Even after the install was finished, when we had concerns about some leftover ductwork, Dave came right out to take a look and fixed it on the spot.
Would definitely recommend Canoga Park Air Conditioning!</review>

For once, I felt the technician was focusing on finding the problem instead of confusing the customer with different issues to complicate matters.  Kevin found the problem, unplugged the main A/C drain pipe from the bathroom plumbing and redirected it into a bucket under the basin.  Unfortunately, he couldn't quite explain the wet in the wall.
Although I still need to call a plumber to complete the task and find the cause root of the damp in the wall, I am satisfied with his work.
One improvement, the company did tell me about the $85 call out charge which only goes towards parts and I since didn't have any parts needed changing, I lost there.. The company did not tell me about $120 hourly rate either. Overall, you can put your trust in the company.< /text>

He took his time working through his lunch to make sure both my heating units were serviced according to my needs. He Cleaned the filters, he made sure  there’s no gas leakage, and added Freon to the unit. He also installed a Nest thermostat for each unit so I can control the temperature from my IPhone.  Thanks to him I don’t need to replace my units. From now on I will use Canoga Park Heating & Air.  👍

May 5th, 2021 Jose Rivera is GREAT!
Such a nice guy! He was on time and so courteous and Covid safe. He came in, accessed the filter and lines and main unit. He gave us a complete run-down on everything and replaced the filter and cleaned up and set us up for a payment schedule and was done in about 30 minutes. Such a pleasure to have him here today.

9/25/20 Kevin Castro came today to search for the smell we keep smelling coming from the AC. He did a thorough inspection and did not locate any problem. He was on time, with a mask and so nice. He told us about another service that can be done to eliminate contaminates in the air and we will be looking into it and may have them come back to set this up for us. We were really happy with our service, again, today.

Allan just came for another filter replacement and unit check. Everything went well. He was in and out in no time and wore a mask the whole time. Always a good experience. Thank you!

Last time: Allan was just here to replace our AC filter and do a check up on our unit. He was on time and thorough in checking everything out. Gave us some great info as well. Great experience! Thank you.</text>

Jose Garcia again showed up earlier than expected and went right to work.  My Aquaguard Alarm came on and my A/C Unit shut down late Monday afternoon.  We were suffering.  Jose immediately went to work and drained the line.  After only a short while,  the job was completed and he was on his way!   Even my dog Lucy was appreciative!  Fantastic job and I continue being a customer of Canoga Park Heating & Air Conditioning for more than 32 years!<//review>

<Text>Canogas Heating & Air's Bob Wiseman was patient & professional in assessing my needs and presenting his proposal. Bob answered all my questions clearly. I used his company for another installation 18 years ago, and I look forward to getting a brand new 5 ton package unit.

I've been doing business with Canoga Park Heating& Air for over 25 years. They are the most dependable company.  They only sell quality products and their support is great.  The best part is Dave Shrode!  He is the best there is!  Dependable to get the job done, responds quickly and values your opinion.< /text>

They sent Kevin who arrived promptly at 8, donned his booties, and went to work. It turned out to be a heater problem, which he fixed and explained to me.  He also changed the filter on my heater and gave me more info about my Nest. Above and beyond, Kevin. Thanks. Now the system is working great. I heartily recommend this company.</review></record>

<text>Got a quote and was extremely relieved that they said I didn't have to replace EVERYTHING (which all other quotes I got said I had to do). I will save more than half the cost by just replacing what they verified has gone bad, and can save the rest of the system for a future repair. I appreciate this kind of honesty and it makes me want to do business with a company like this.< /text><pics>None< /pics>< response>

This was our first experience with Canoga Park Heating & Air Conditioning.  We have relatively new Lennox units and have been remodeling so needed one hooked back up and needed some duct work tweaked on the other.  Dave was on time, courteous, incredibly knowledgeable and honest.  He spent time getting up to speed on what we needed and absolutely acted in my best interest when he told me that while he'd love to have our business, we would be better reaching out to our original Lennox dealer.  He then offered possible solutions for our duct work.  I tried to pay for a service call and he simply said the visit was complementary and that their philosophy is not "a customer for the day", it's "a customer for life". I  am sad we aren't able to work with Dave and Canoga Park Heating & A/C. I highly recommend them!  In addition to Dave's amazingness, the company texts reminders and alerts when the technician is on his way. They include a photo of who's coming as well.  A top notch company!  Thank you, Canoga Park Heating & Air Conditioning!< /review>

After their technician Johnny came in and diagnosed the problem with my heating system, he suggested to replace the circuit pump. Few weeks later the part came in and he replaced it but there was still no hot air! Then he said the problem is with the water valves and I need to call a plumber to fix it. And still demanded me to pay $1200 for a service that has not fixed my problem. How unprofessional is this? I spoke to Ben in their office today and shamelessly he too wanted me to pay this amount!

I do not recommend anyone to use this company.< /Text>

Allen arrived and was very friendly.  He explained everything he intended  to check and thoroughly went about his business checking the AC refrigerant level and operating controls of the outside unit.  He gently washed the fins of the exterior unit for better air flow.

He also checked the forced air component inside and temperature levels coming from all room vents.  Very professional!<//Text>

Jose & Greg:  outstanding work ethic...both extremely professional, respectful of the house and my time, highly knowledgeable, personable / communicative of the process, AND efficient!  As a service business owner, I'm sensitive to customer service, and these guys checked all the boxes - obviously a reflection of the culture at Canoga Park Heating & Air Conditioning!!</Review>

We bought a Carrier unit from them. I have been using their services for almost 10 years and have been totally satisfied. Their service technician Eddie is absolutely outstanding. Has always done a diligent and an excellent job whenever he has come by for servicing our unit. He is a great asset to the company. He is consistent and has only gotten better over time. We are so lucky to be able to get the benefit of his services.We wish him the best in all his endeavors.< /review>

He exhibited an excellent knowledge and took time to explain what he was doing as he worked. When questioned about the problems he was looking for and what symptoms might develop he was quick to point out that the needed repairs should only be done by a qualified professional. What was even better was his more than favorable appreciation for his employer. Johnny is welcome to service our HVAC system any time. Good Job!<//Review>< Pics>

<Review>Johnny was on time and immediately got to work. Showed me the filter was okay until summer checkup. He was pleasant to speak with and completed his work in an efficient manner. He remembered providing service here before. Wished us happy holidays.
I continue to be completely satisfied with the maintenance service CPHVAC has provided over the last four years since they installed the complete heating and AC system.< /Review>< pictures>

Allen Serviced the air conditioning. He did a very thorough job: change the filter, check the condensation tube in the attic, check the coil, then check the condenser for Freon, then check all the registries for cool temperature. Never had any technician done this before. I am very happy with the service that Allen delivered.</review>

Jose was Outstanding!

He was extremely knowledgeable, very pleasant and personable.  He even sent out an alert to let me know he was on his way.

He took the time to explain things to me in detail so that I had understanding of my new AC and its maintenance.  He even set up and told me how to use the Wi-Fi to program my AC.

Jose was very pleasant and personable.  He was easy to talk to, and he didn’t rush through the process.   He took time to make sure I had excellent service.

Canoga Park Heating and Air Conditioning is my all-time favorite vendor. It’s a family run business, and they treat their customers like family !!  Thanks, Jose !!< /review>

Kevin did well. He kept us informed of his expected arrival time, arrived when promised, and went right to work. He completed the service requested, and suggested an additional procedure. He explained the benefits of the suggested work without pressing us to accept it. We are very satisfied.< /Review>

The tech was great and thorough. However,  Inspection of HVAC system for purchase of house.  I must have misunderstood, I thought . I would get an estimate for repairs from the technician that came out but have to have a separate tech come out.  Since I don't yet own the home this is problematic!  In essence I paid to service the existing homeowners system and to learn what was wrong but without the estimate for the larger repair.  Wish it could have been done in one visit.< /Review>

He  also explained how we should use the appliance to prevent over loading it thereby prolonging the life of our AC unit.  We will request him  next time we have an AC or heater  issue.

Only wanted $85 service call!! I was told that the service charge would go towards any work I had done. Guy said he couldn’t give me a price to repair my unit because only people in the office can do that. Told me we needed our new thermostat wired correctly, I asked how much to do that he said $120 ok fine wire it correctly then and I’ll use the $85 service fee towards that. NO CAN DO! I’ve unplugged the system upstairs because the wires are bad. What does that have to do with you hooking up my new thermostats correctly???? So let me get this straight....you can’t give me a quote on repairing my system, you are refusing to do any work while your here, and you want me to pay you $85 which is supposed to go towards any work I have done, but yet you won’t do anything!! And you still think I should pay you!! No way. You completed wasted my time and only wanted to collect a fee for doing no work at all!!!!   Shame On You!!!< /Text>

Kevin Castro was great! He did our maintenance and then educated us on why we should upgrade to a Nest now. He was patient, very informative, clean and quick.< /text>

<text>Jose B. is very friendly & professional. He called to see if he could come ahead of the scheduled appointment which was better for us. When he arrived he explained the procedures of what he was going to do. He was very efficient, and when he installed our Nest Thermostat he showed us, step by step, how to adjust the thermostat, and helped me put the app on my phone.  He was wonderful.</text>< Resp>

Eddie the service tech did well, except for tracking leaves in. He was very helpful at explaining some things that I can do my self to save on $$. He was also friendly and good worker. Only trouble area is getting a receipt with my correct name and address on it. Started with wrong first name, last name, city, and zip on both billing and Job address. After three tries by email to get corrected receipt, they still have wrong first name on Job address, but I am giving up on it. I am glade Eddie's knowledge of AC is better than their ability to write receipts.</review>

<review>Our heating unit went out on one of the coldest nights this winter.  This company couldn't initially come out the same day but while I was calling around, they called me back and was able to come out that morning. Their service man, Kevin, was very polite and efficient in assessing the problem. He had to order and pick up a part but was back as quickly as could be expected. He took care of the part installation and we were warming the house back up to a livable temperature in record time. I was very pleased with the result.

A different tech recently visited my home. When I changed the filter myself months later, I noticed that he put it in upside down. This makes me wonder if he was competent in doing the other tasks that I am unable to check. I have contacted the company but  there has been no follow up from them.</text>

Normally a good company to service my AC, but this time I had my normal servicing and one week later my condensation wasn't coming through the outlet valve.  AC wasn't working, only pushing out warm air during a 113 degree day.  CPHAC doesn't work on the weekends and finding a reputable service company on the weekend wasn't easy.  I did get someone to come out at 7:30pm and fix it.  Should have been checked by Canoga Park Heating and Air.  Only reason for 3 stars is they are normally reliable.</text>

I am the second generation in my family to use Canoga Heating and Air.  They have always been spot on - since the 1970s - and Allen is the BEST! Fast, dependable, knowledgable and realistic.  He explains things, gives options and works fast.  I highly recommend Canoga Heating and Air and Allen!

I've worked with Allen in the past and today I found out he has retired.  Good for him - sad for me.  Then today I met Juan - WOW!  HE KNOWS WHAT HE IS DOING🤗   he works fast, takes time to explain issues; is neat and leaves the worplace pristine.  He is patient, polite and kind.  Please send him back to my house when needed.  He is great!</text>

<Text>Dave was on time (even a little early!), super knowledgable and friendly. I can tell Canoga Heating & Air would do a wonderful job installing a new HVAC system. Their price seemed a bit high but I get the sense it is reflective of the kind of quality and attention they would put into installing and maintaining....recommended.<//Text>< pictures>

Canoga Park Heating and Air is the most professional and honest service provider I have ever came into contact with. The fact thier service guts don't work off commission gives me a piece of mind that the service is done correctly without, "hey you need a new this or that." They come complete the service and educate me on how to conduct proper matianance in between our annual checkup.

Two thumbs up and highly recommend them for all your heating and AC needs.< /text>

<Review>Canoga Heating and Air replaced our HVAC 15 years ago.  The installation was smooth sailing.  The system has been fantastic.  We have regular service.  The technicians are professional, courteous,  show up on time and they even wash the unit.  They always clean up after their work is done with a wonderful attitude. We usually get the same technicians.  Eddie just left,  he found a bad capacitor, he showed me how he tested it and he replaced it avoiding a system failure.  They are a family business and we feel like a part of their family.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< gmap_id>

Kevin was very thorough and professional. He located the problem I was having and got me on the way to a solution. Turned out to be the roof, not the HVAC, but the photos he provided me with were very helpful.<//Text>
