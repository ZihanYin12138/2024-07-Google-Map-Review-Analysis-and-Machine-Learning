Take all of the negative reviews and add to it one more. You do not answer the phone and we leave a message with the phone number to call. It takes several calls to get a return call. You do not call the number given, I don't get the message. You do not confirm the message. Your problem is organization and just responding to the customer. Your employees are pleasant, when we can talk to them. Right now, the worse customer service I have dealt with. And it does not change. I have tried leaving, but my insurance company insist I go through you. Get it together.< /text>

< review>
Awful experience! I am a legal guardian to my brother who has diabetes type 1. Always have the same issue with his diabetes supplies not getting delivered on time even when calling  2 weeks in advance so we wont be without insulin.  Due to the delivery delay or wrong order we had to go to the ER because of DKA 3times now. This is not acceptable only because my insurance insists to get supply from here but I am looking to change supplier to homecare. This is too much putting lives in danger and seeing our loved ones suffer!!<//review>

<pictures>None< /pictures><review>When trying to contact this pharmacy via phone, plan on spending at least an hour. When you finally navigate through the voice menus you end up being asked to leave a message which no one returns. My wife is a diabetic and on an insulin pump, after reaching out to the pharmacy for more than a week she was running low on supplies. For three days she left countless messages which were never returned. We are still waiting and her supplies are critically low. As a pharmacist myself I cannot say that I would trust this pharmacy with any of my prescription needs. We have asked to speak to the pharmacy manager and are still waiting. This is just unacceptable for a pharmacy and especially jeopardizing the life of a diabetic who has no recourse. I will take this to the State Board if necessary.< /review>< Gmap_id>

<Text>If I could give a negative rating I would!!  I have been a customer for my sons growth supplement for over 6 yrs.  The 2 other ladies I used to work with have left and it has taken over 3 weeks, over 30 calls to the pharmacy, getting on a 2-way call with Medi-Cal and even Medi-Cal was trying to help me with the new people working this dept.  Its not the customers fault you lost good employees that were competent and knowledgeable.  You need to train your employees to do their job accurately.  I, the customer should not have to get involved every step of the way to make sure my son gets his medication (calling his pediatrician for chart and growth notes, calling Medi-cal 4 times, calling the Pharmacy more times than I can count daily.)  I gave a 5 star rating for this company yrs ago and now I am simply in shock at how bad the service has become in such a short period of time.  If anyone has any advice on another Pharmacy that can help me and not put me through this nightmare,  I would love to get that info!

I highly recommend Mini Pharmacy and it’s staff      My daughter has had type 1 diabetes for 48 years, and it’s very reassuring to know that I can depend on Mini Pharmacy to manage the delivery of her Dexcom G6 supplies which make her blood sugars safe. In particular, Sandra Mullins, lead, has given outstanding support. Shirley Babior<//Review>

So far, terrible service. My diabetes nutrition center even warned me that they often forget to send supplies and the front desk sighs when I mention them. Unfortunately I didn't heed their warning and called mini pharmacy too late and ran out of my diabetes testing strips and lancets. I called, was on hold for about 20mins before speaking with someone only to be told they didn't know why my shipment didn't ship. The rep said she'd have someone call me back later with an update.

I got a call later that day just confirming my order. No apology or explanation of why my shipment didn't go out. I was down to my last strip and had to request they send it faster than their 6-7 business day shipping. They changed it to 2-3 business days. I got the shipment four days later but only received strips and not lancets! On the invoice the lancets were crossed out for some reason yet they're still billing me for them! I've had to go purchase my own since I'm down to my last two lancets now! It's so frustrating to only get a partial order and have to go out of my way to spend extra money for my supplies!<//Review>

I want to highly recommend Mini Pharmacy for their creative problem solving. My wife and I are traveling out of country and I found myself without enough medical supplies to make the trip and return home without running out, I called the company and explained the situation as we will be leaving sooner than the scheduled shipment date. Their staff arranged for a special overnight shipment which solved the problem. I want to publicly acknowledge this company and their staff for solving my problem in a timely manner.< /review>

<Text>I'm a new patient and let me say not off to a great start. To start there was an issue with them not having all my correct  insurance info, which they should have called to let me know instead of me waiting for my stuff for a week  and being told that. Second after that was resolved I waited another week. So I called again only to be told I have a co-pay. So again why don't they call to let me know. I make my co-pay and a week late still no supplies. I call again and they tell me I have another co-pay for the second month (mind you I haven't even gotten the first set of supplies). After about an hour later they resolved the issue  that it was a billing error on their part.  According to them I should receive my supplies 2-5 days. I guess I will have to wait and see if that will happen.< /Text><user>114877250588457936276<//user></record></dataset><record>

If I could rate this lower I would. Irresponsible and unethical medical practice. Reporting to California Department of Consumer Affairs. If you have to work with this "pharmacy" try to get help from a patient advocate group and do not assume they will fill or deliver your medical supplies without constant and repeated phone calls, even if said supplies are required for you to sustain your life (like insulin pump supplies for type1 diabetics). I'm not exaggerating. Be vigilant.</Text>

Horrible been waiting 3 months for a device my daughter needs. And we still don't have it and the old one expires tomorrow. I have called them several times in the past 3 months and still no result. I am so done and going to cancel any future prescriptions being a type one diabetic means you need your prescriptions on time. My daughter is now without the item she needs because of this company.<//review>

Used to be good on delivery with the 10 day sensors,  but when they went to the 14 days, they aren't reliable. Had to go back to finger sticks while waiting.  I think they forget to place the orders until I call back and doing  finger sticks. Can't trust them! Hope it gets better n out w with the new app. Otherwise I'll have to go somewhere else.<//review>

After my last not so good review, I received a call from the CEO.  He was friendly and eager to make things right.  He expedited my mom’s order and received the Dexcom with in 3 working days. I hope that this type of service will continue as I’m getting ready to order more sensors.  I will continue to post my reviews as time goes by and depends on how quickly my order is expedited.  I look forward to do business with Mini Pharmacy.< /Text>

<rate>5<//rate><review>I called Mini Pharmacy to request my diabetic supplies.  I was lucky to speak to Bryanna to place my order.  Im stressing because I'm moving to Nevada and busy packing... can't find anything lol.  Bryanna was not only professional, she was so patient with me when I could not find my glasses.  Once I found them I was able to provide all the information she needed to complete my diabetic supply order.  She was just great, I did not have to repeat anything, great listening skills on her part!

Just wanted to tell you how lucky you are to have her in your employ.  I hope all my future  contact with Mini Pharmacy is as great as the one I had today !

Way to go Bryanna, you got a 10 from me !  Stay safe and healthy.

<review>Since finding out my daughter is a diabetic this year in July has been a hectic time in our lives. At first Mini Pharmacy was good about getting orders out in a timely matter even before I called to order myself. Now this is going on I think the 3rd time ordering I called last week and they said my order would be here Monday or Tuesday here it is Thursday. I have called them 3 different times and even was told I would be called back and nothing except today when I called they told me there was NO ORDER! I call as soon as we put on my daughter's last sensor. They have in their system I called twice but nothing else. So early in using this company through my insurance and we are already have problems. It's already hard enough I have a 3 year old diabetic now I have to sit and wait daily for an order that was not processed even though the gentleman said he was ordering them that day. I am so disappointed. If it keeps going like this I might just go back to finger sticks at least that was reliable.</review>< Pictures>

My worst and scariest encounter was not receiving my insulin on time and having no insulin for 3 days I actually had to go to my endocrine clinic (which is 3 hours away in loma Linda which is a huge inconvenience on my part) and pick some up not to mention it’s not the only time it’s happened either I’ve even showed up to the mini pharmacy office to pick up my stuff. I don’t know what happened but this pharmacy really went down hill. Now I use my local cvs to supply my insulin and pray they don’t mess up sending other supplies.

<review>Terrible service. Sent me the incorrect supplier at my first order. After calling them to ask for resend my missing items, being told it would be sent overnight but never received it. This company eventually forgot about my second refill, have to ask my doctor to call them during office visit. Again, they messed up with my order, forgot to include the lancets again in my package but charged my insurance for two boxes of lancets. This is the worst service I’ve ever dealt with.</review>< Pictures>

You will never get your supplies on time. You have to call multiple times !!!!!!!with no answer! Sorry for trying to stay alive.!!  After a week, run out all the missing items, keep call and wait ,they just said will deliver and will have person handling, Please tell the truth, if you only collect money and don't give the items , you are fraudulent!

The most unprofessional and incompetent company I’ve dealt with in all capacities. I was told to call my doctor and “give them a piece of my mind” to send over paper work they need. Umm no??!!

Once again Mini Pharmacy drops the ball. Just like last month. I don't know how they are still in business! My dtr called in her pump and dexcon refills on Jan 2nd...its now the 11th and they are still not here. This happens almost EVERY month. We actually changed insurances with the hope that we do NOT have to continue to go thru this unreliable pharmacy any longer...... If I could give a negative star I would.

Horrible service! Unreliable, they never answer the phone. Always a problem with each refill order. Do NOT use them! I sent an email last week to order my daughters refills and nothing happened. I emailed again yesterday because everytime I call it just disconnects. Today I received a response to my email which said it was forwaded to a manager. I replied and asked for the status of the refills and got no response. Last month my daughter had to go back to finger sticks because her Dexcom supplies never came. Now her pump supplies are going to be late ao she will have to go back to her pens. This disease is frustrating enough without the added stress of your companies incompetence.
12/4-So I received a call back late 11/27 from a pediatric supervisor named Macy. She said the refills requested needed prior auth. She would call me on the 29th and give me status. I never recieved a phone call. I called on 11/30 and was told the prior auth was still pending from Aetna and they would call me back on 12/3 with a status. Its 12/4 and I havnt heard anything back. Luckily I dont get my daughters insulin thru you all or she would be in the hospital.</text>

My question is how does this place Stay in business with the horrible service? Every time our order comes late. One order had half of the supplies ordered. Up to 45 minute wait to speak to someone on the phone ridiculous. I noticed on the one-star reviews the owner replies, I apologize for your inconvenience, don't waste your time replying to me I've heard your story before. I'm calling my doctor at UCLA and want an explanation why he would send us to a pharmacy as terrible as this.</review>

I called Mini Pharmacy this morning and spoke to Sandra in the Medicare department. My 86 years old husband with arthritis in the hands and macular degeration of the eyes and insulin diabetic had 24 hrs left on his 14 day Libre sensor. He was in a BIG PANIC since he was leaving tomorrow morning to chaperone our grand-daughter on an out of state trip and he was out of sensors. Mini Pharmacy has delivered his sensors in a timely & routine fashion for months. Unfortunately we had two sensors that were defective and had to return directly to Abbott and we were waiting for the replacements. I explained all this drama to Sandra.

She was quick to resolve the PANIC - she said we were not eligible for refill until October 16 but we could pay retail for a box and she would make sure it got delivered today.  Sandra and Mini Pharmacy rescued us - they took our order and we just received deliver. We are both very relieved and believe that miracles do happen.

It's just not doing your job but thinking out of the box and making what matters to your customer count. Kudos to Sandra and Mini Pharmacy. If we could give them 10 stars we would.< /Text>

< review>
I’m a type 1 diabetic, this pharmacy has been “supplying” me with insulin for the past couple years . And I put quotes because they are the reason I feel like I am actually going to die from complications. Today, is the second day without proper insulin. I’ve been using long lasting instead of my usual hum along because I haven’t gotten it yet. I’ve been in DKA over 5 times in my lifetime. Most recently I was in the ICU. Not only do I feel so angry and upset about it because you guys literally have my life in your hands, but also don’t act like it’s serious.<//review>

If I could rate zero I would.  I'm very surprised to see positive reviews honestly as when I looked online before (maybe yelp - not sure), I saw numerous bad reviews that echoed my experience.  Mini Pharmacy has in the past, and continues to be, the worst pharmacy I have ever dealt with in all of my years.  In the past the hold time was as long as 45 minutes to an hour although that has definitely improved.  But trying to get my Dexcom and Omnipod insulin pump has been hell.  After nearly 3 weeks of working on this with nearly daily phone calls and call backs, and a lot of back and forth and back and forth, I find out yesterday, that the whole thing has been sitting on someone's desk.  They were so negligent that they had to send me samples because they couldn't get their act together.  I'm so so super frustrated!  Well, here I go again, about to call back for the Nth time, to see where things stand.  What a PITA!<//text>

Little wonder this pharmacy has 2 star rating. Most, like me would give it ZERO stars but we are required to give it one star in order to write the review.

When you call this place -- ifs IFFY at best - which means you might wait on the line for LONG time, probably be sent to voice mail, may not get ANY response at ALL.

If , after you finally get someone on the other end of the line, you complain, they will give you "extensions" so you can supposedly get through to them on subsequent calls (I have 3).  When you dial the extensions, you may or may not get a live person.  I called and dialed ALL THREE OF THE EXTENSIONS I have last week and got a recording with each one.

So, I decided to call and leave a message as they request, with name and date of birth.  This was on Wed. last.  Today is Saturday and still haven't heard from them.  I called today (although I suspect they are closed) and left another message.  I will also be calling again on Monday.

The reason I gave 2 stars and not one is that when they DO actually talk to you and get your info they manage to get your script out pretty fast - like the next day or so (but that is the responsibility of EVERY pharmacy)

Honestly, I agree with another reviewer who said this pharmacy should be shut down.

I filed a complaint with the California State Board of Pharmacy.  I will express my grievance and direct them to this site for confirmation of their poor service.  I suggest others who visit this site and are not happy with the service they are receiving should do the same.  Just Google the name of the board and you will directed to the site.  It doesn't take long and is pretty straight forward.  Their license # is PHY 57214.

Additionally, I will speak to my Endo who sent my RX to them to be filled and let him know in no uncertain terms as to how lousy their service is (will direct him to these Google reviews) and request that he send my RX to another pharmacy for fulfillment.

Will update after they reply to my last call, although at this point NOTHING they say or do will warrant adding stars, if anything perhaps losing one.
______

Well its Tuesday and no one has called me back and script has not been filled.  I made multiple calls today and left multiple messages on multiple extensions (the ones they gave me to assure me someone would answer and take care of business)

Once again, I recommend everyone having problems with this Pharmacy to file their complaint with the State Board.  You can do it on line, its a simple form, and will only take you a few minutes.
_____

I just noticed that this company has 1.5 star Yelp rating with 90 reviews.
---------------------------------

Edit: Since writing this scathing review I have to say that the company has  managed to deliver my diabetic supplies in a timely manner and I no longer have anything to complain about.  I also noticed that their Yelp review has gone from 1.5 stars to 2 stars.  I hope they keep up the good work and make their customers happy, because that is what business is all about.<//Review>

worst EVER service, which is acutely problematic as diabetes supplies are literally necessary for life.  If you have options for diabetes supplies, DO NOT work with this outfit.  unfortunately for me - I seem to be stuck and my health suffers as a result.  I cannot get timely deliveries of monitoring supplies or pump supplies.  Apparently it is acceptable to this pharmacy to have me guess my BG?< /review>

I previously, had problems with bad customer service calls, and delivery. So, I took inniciative to pick up my child supplies in person. I like the service, and I don't have a complaint. You need to check in with Security before so, he can notify the Manager on site to enter the building. Both security and personal are very polite and respectful. There is a waiting area. Waiting time max is 10 minutes. Call them before picking up supplies.< /review>

Why bother getting an insulin pump if you have to use this pharmacy. You will never get your supplies on time. It takes weeks before you see your refills. You have to call multiple times to get anything done and after the 3rd call they make sure you know you are annoying. Sorry for trying to stay alive.</Review>

This is the worst company to deal with. They use On trac delivery service that requires a signature no matter what.  Well I was home but somehow missed the delivery man twice.  Mini pharmacy assured me my package would be here tomorrow.  That was two weeks ago.  Finally called on trac myself because mini pharmacy couldn’t be bothered to.  They told me the same thing.  That it would be here tomorrow.  That was two days ago. I called on trac again today and wouldn’t you know.  My package should be here TOMORROW!!! I am so frustrated! I am 9 months pregnant and haven’t been able to take a nap, or shower while I’m home alone for the past two weeks because I’m afraid I’m going to miss my delivery!!! I will be complaining to the hospital program that referred me to mini pharmacy as well.< /Review>

< Review>
Worst Pharmacy ever, customer service is the worst.  They don’t know what they are doing, I been stuck with this pharmacy for a while since it’s the only one that provides Pedisure through medical. I been having issues with them for the last 3 years, I have a special needs son and needs his pedisure and sometimes I need to buy it myself since it never arrives on time or they forget to send it, or forget to put in the order. I complain to my doctor and notified me that they are looking into another pharmacy because they been having to many complaints. Hopefully they find one because they don’t care about anyone needs. If anybody reads my review that has the same issues or manage to find another pharmacy let me know. I complaint to Mini Pharmacy time after time, and all they say is the same bull***, sorry blah blah it will not happen again. I live in the San Diego Area. Thanks<//Review>

This pharmacy must have some sort of contract with our child’s endocrinologist, but their lack of customer service is astounding. Unacceptable lack of attention to detail. We call every month to fix what hey have done wrong, whic is usually that they didn’t do anything. Switching every order to a different pharmacy right now.<//review>

This pharmacy sucks I always run out of medicine because they obviously don’t know how to work auto order and I have to call them every month and when I do call I’m on hold for almost an hour or more and when I leave a message it takes them days to get back to me. I’m not impressed or happy at all they need to do better they work with diabetics who can get seriously sick without medications and I hate having DKA.<//text>

<Text>If I could give negative 5 stars I would. This is absolutely the WORST pharmacy I have ever dealt with. My child is T1D and we signed up for this service in the hospital and I thought it would make a difficult situation a little easier. WRONG. The phone hold times are horrible and each month they never sent any of the supplies on time. I had to call them every single time and ask them to send out our order before we ran out. AND THEY NEVER DID IT. I reported them to the BBB, they have no business handling the needs of diabetic patients they are incompetent.

<review>yet another bad experience with Mini Pharm.  Last month was promised my glucose testing strips order was on auto refill.

Worst place to rely for your diabetic medicine, never deliver your medicine on time , when refills expire you never get a courtesy  call to let you know your going to need doctor refills, there's always a long waiting when you call for your prescription ...I have never wrote a review before, this is  my fist time, I alway thought is was a waste of time, but in this case we are taking about my son life, he needs to inject  insulin with every meal to keep his sugar level normal...think twice before  you used there service..< /review>

At first this place was not so bad, but by the third time I received my test strips and needles they left everything out in the rain and it was all damaged. I called and had them pick up the items because I could not use them and then I canceled my subscription. After canceling, I received four calls from different people telling me that I still had to pay for everything even though I returned it all. They blamed me for their mistake and all the damages. Later, I had received 3 bills within the span of a couple months for those items that I returned, telling me that I still owed them even though I cancelled. I now go to the rite aid nearest to me because it is not overpriced and I do not have to deal with bad customer service. It was very frustrating and the people that I talked to were not kind or helpful in any way.< /review>

Called for supplies and no response for 10 business days. Called back and was informed that since medicare was primary insurance they cannot fill order. When asked why it took so long and I had to callback I was told they were busy. Never use company if you need persciptions filled. You will die before they respond to you</text>

<Text>This place is the worst business I have ever dealt with. I have tried for 3 months to get my son's supplies transferred from here and every time the other pharmacy calls they tell them the supplies have already been ordered and shipped then nothing appears. They are scamming me and my insurance. It is awful. I am telling my doctor and posting on jdrf that this is an awful business. Do not go here.<//Text>< Resp>

My child is type 1 diabetic and I have to say this is the worst pharmacy experience I have ever had.  They constantly make mistakes and then blame the customer.  They put you on hold every single time no matter what time of day.  I could have run to the local pharmacy maybe 3 times in the time it takes to use their supposed convenient service.  On top of that they make you, the customer, work out all the detail with your own insurance.  Imperial Beach pharmacy offers the same services with EXCELLENT service.  If you want a convenient service with courteous staff this is not a good company to deal with.  My experience has been 100% horrible!!!</text>

Do not recommend this service. It is a hassle to get payments through. They send you a letter and they request your credit information through mail. If they accept checks that is unclear. I had a balance for over 90 days for $14 and I received a letter saying they were going to report me to collections. Due to limited time I didnt attempt to send in a check so I called and I had to wait 20+ minutes to speak to an actual person. Once I spoke to the person I mentioned how the device they sent me NEVER worked which is why I was hesitant to pay in the first place. She didnt care and continued to collect $14 from me. I paid anyway, done and over with. No longer have to deal with this pharmacy again. With these business practices I doubt they'll be in business for too long.</text>

Long phone cues, absolutely slow and late service, my blood sugar reaches 500+ at the end of each month because they don't ship my VGo pumps on time. Their slow service is directly responsible for my high blood sugars.< /text>

If i can rate this pharmacy it would be zero stars late with sending out meds., never ever on auto refill I have to call every month to make sure my son meds are been delivered and they even told me it was my fault for his meds not to come in TIME...what kind of BS is that. I even talk to the manager he's NO HELP at all in making things work out , even tho he told my son nurse that he want to deal with issue's in ways to solve it. My opinion go somewhere else .</Review>

HANDS DOWN THE WORST PHARMACY I HAVE EVER USED.

It really is laughable, because their phone system while you are on hold repeats about how "customer service is so important to us."

Worst experience I have ever had. None of them know what they are talking about, provide false information, and don't want to lift a finger.

I have diabetes and have been dealing with their bullshit for weeks, just trying to get my prescriptions faxed over - they literally won't even check the fax machine, and keep pointing the finger at someone else.

Extremely lazy and such an awful choice for people like me who have diabetes and actually need their medications.</Text>

<response>None<//response><review>I had a bad experience with their home delivery service. I called on a Thursday to confirm that my reoccurring order had been placed and was told that I would receive my order no later than Tuesday. By Thursday, when I still had not received my order, I called and was told my order would not arrive until Saturday. (Of course, the order did not arrive on Saturday.) I did not receive the order until the following Tuesday.

The person I spoke with was unapologetic and would not admit to a mistake on the pharmacy's end. To add to the frustration, my doctor's office had to call in a special order to my local pharmacy but since Mini Pharmacy had already invoiced my insurance company, I had to pay out of pocket for the special order. I don't usually leave these kinds of reviews but I'm particularly disappointed and think others should be aware of this problem.<//review><userid>111559508562594010211<//userid>< username>

My son was diagnosed at 18 months old with type 1 diabetes. When the package from them came to the hospital I was promised it would come like clock work every month to my home so I would not have to stress about my son getting the medicine he needs to STAY ALIVE! For 2 months they were great. After 2 months I didn't get all his supplies. When I called a pharmacist told me he would personally make sure my son's account was taken care of.. 2 months of good service and BAM NO INSULIN AGAIN! I called again, and again a supervisor told me they would personally take care of my son's case. 2 months of good service and again NO INSULIN! I now have a pharmacy in my area that will take my son's case. GOOD BYE MINI PHARMACY  I NO LONGER NEED YOU! Their service is a joke! A delivery guy THREW my son's box at my door last month, and this February I didn't get his supplies until the 28th! I was supposed to get them on the 18th! DO NOT USE THIS PHARMACY!!! AND when you call because you are upset, you get attitude from their people! If you do use this pharmacy go straight to a supervisor, they're the only courteous people there.< /Review>< Pics>

This is the worst pharmacy ever. I would give zero stars if I could. I am advocating to my insurance to go through a new pharmacy. -Samantha Palmer.<//Review>

I’ve ordered my supplies a over a week ago and haven’t received them. Ever time I call them to check up on my order, they tell me that the “department isn’t here and they will call you tomorrow”, yet I’ve NEVER gotten a call from this elusive “department”. Avoid this pharmacy at all costs.<//review>< user_name>

< Review>
Absolute nightmare. My daughter is a T1D and we use mini pharmacy for her Dexcom G4 Platinum CGM. EVERY time I have to reorder supplies they won't allow us to even place the order until one week before her last sensor expires. It takes 3-5 business days for them to even get them to us once they are shipped. That's not to mention the terrible 3-5 day waiting period where they are "Waiting for authorization". Every single refill has been a nightmare and my daughter ALWAYS runs out of sensors. I get told by "The rep in charge of her account" that they will rush orders and overnight them via FedEx, then after two days of waiting for the shipment I call and find out they will never overnight products, they only ship ground. I will be finding another pharmacy to get these supplies from because Mini Pharmacy is an absolute headache!< /Review>

<UserId.>114705377094090510034</UserId.><review>I've had a really good experience with Mini Pharmacy, so I'm confused about the negative reviews to be honest. I moved my test strip purchases to them when I was unable to get Abbott Freestyle strips for my Omnipod. Abbott kept giving me a generic list of vendors, but the vendor I went to was on the list. That didn't help. Omnipod referred me to Mini Pharmacy and I've not had problems since. They got my strips out to me quickly and have had them on autoship since then. It's been easy and automatic.

They've been easy to work with too. When I call there is a hold, but, honestly, what matters to me most is the interaction that I have with the agent when I call.<//review><time>1452814463967<//time>< rating>

<name>Ally A.</name>< review>
I was diagnosed with gestational diabetes; my doctor set up getting my meter, strips, and lancets with Mini Pharmacy. My first order came in overnight and I had no issues. I tried placing a refill order a few days before I ran out of strips, but the rep told me I had to wait until the exact date that my order ran out before they could send me a second order. I was grilled on how often I was testing, how many strips I received in my first order, etc. She was able to send me a few sample boxes of strips in case I ran out. My third order was supposedly sent out overnight but I did not get it. I had to call and ask where it was, I was told it would arrive the next day. For my last order; I called and placed an order that I assumed would arrive the next day just as my previous orders had arrived. I never had to ask for overnight delivery. I didn't get the order, so I called and the rep told me it was mailed regular mail and could take 3-5 days to arrive to me. She told me that processing determines how your order is mailed out unless you ask it to be overnight-ed. I wish I knew I had to request overnight delivery because I cannot wait 5 days for strips to come in, especially when I can only order on the date my previous order expired. I am not allowed to skip testing days per my doctor's orders. The rep also told me she has delivery confirmation it arrived to my box, however there was no note that I had a package waiting for me at the post office and it was not delivered at my door. She told me she would need to contact USPS to verify the delivery and then they can mail another order out. That is fine but they have no signature confirmation to verify someone signed for the package, the post man may have ended up setting it at someone else's door or putting it in someone else's box. Meanwhile I have 1 day left of strips to somehow get me through the next 2 days. I work as a call center manager for an online traffic school, and if I had any of the reps I have spoke with working with me, they would be getting their termination papers. I give this company 2 stars only because one rep was able to give me some sample boxes of strips, otherwise they would get 1 star. My advice: find a better company that has a better record of deliveries and has better customer service.< /review>

Don't use them stay away. They didn't let me know they had difficulty getting doctors notes only found out when I phoned them to find out why I didn't get my supplies.. They said they don't have enough staff to contact customers. So you have been warned.</Text>

< review>
I was not offered any other pharmacy to choose by my gestational diabetes nurse. As a pharmacist, this bothered me at first (since patients technically have the right to use the pharmacy of their choice), but I figured maybe I should give this pharmacy a try (maybe it was cheaper through my insurance). I got my first set of test strips and lancets delivered and left on my doorstep in a timely manner when I was not home, but I was not as concerned since at that time, the temperature outside was around mid-70 degrees Fahrenheit (my test strips are not allowed to be in temperatures below 36 degrees or above 86 degrees Fahrenheit or risk inaccurate blood sugar readings). Yesterday, I called Mini Pharmacy about my refill and concern with the temperature outside, especially with it being summer in southern California with high temperatures close to 90's or more. I was told that they will deliver my refill with their own pharmacy driver (not their contracted mail delivery carrier) on Monday before noon when I would most likely be home (and less likely be hot outside). I get the delivery left on my doorstep today instead (Saturday) at 84 degree weather by OnTrac, I have the Ring doorbell which told me they delivered around 1:25 pm, and I had to rush home from a family event to bring my test strips indoors before it got hotter (high today is expected to be 89 degrees).

Even though I managed to bring it indoors before it got to 86 degrees, I was disturbed that my package was delivered not as promised and without a signature to verify I was home (even the outside box label said "Signature Required"). What would have happened if this was a more delicate medication or if I was not there in time with the high heat outside? This should be my last prescription fill for this pregnancy, but if I ever need to go through this again, I would rather request my health provider send my prescription to a nearby pharmacy where I can physically pick up my order in an indoor environment.</review>

I can't believe it's legal for insurance to force people to use mini pharmacy.  They are a disaster.  It generally takes 3 calls to get anything done (including receiving orders that are approved and ready to go).  They forced me off an insulin pump because they couldn't get me supplies consistently.</text>

We appreciate the review and the kind words about the cleanliness of our facility, we take deep pride in our work space. Though, No work is to be performed without your consent and approval. Our standard operating procedure is to provide you with an estimate to inspect the brakes and your signature is our green light to proceed with the initial brake inspection, after the inspection is complete you are then provided with an estimate that comes with a 3yr/36,000 mile nationwide warranty and a dedicated ASE Master Certified Technician. As of your tires... i saw the pictures you provided and those are not grease marks those are signs of dirt stains embedded into the rubber, But we are more than willing to shampoo your tires if you'd like.\nThank You."}</resp>< user_name>

<review>I felt that once you've informed them that you cannot afford a $900 brake job that they (or at least Chase) starts talking condescendingly or becomes short with you. Suddenly I felt as though I was wasting his time asking questions. The final negative tone came when I asked for the cost breakdown and was told it was stapled to my receipt. That being said with a tone of annoyance is unacceptable. I was reading the technicians notes when he said something and stapled something to the receipt.

The waiting area is very nice, very modern, up to date with every phone cord imaginable to charge your phone, reclining seats, etc.

Upon walking in I waited approx 5-10 minutes for  someone to come in and help me. A full time person in the front would be very beneficial to them.

Upon receipt of my car my tires were not wiped down from the grease and grime from the technician. Now mind you, I live in the desert - the car isn't in the best shape and is dusty. But not grease and dust. It makes me believe that they felt less of a duty to care for the things they touched since my car was already an issue.

My door pocket had been gone through. They may state it was to find a lug nut, however, had they kept ransacking my car they would have found it in the center arm rest.

When I originally called them to discuss my brake issue, not once on the phone did Chase inform me there was a cost to inspect. I would have gone somewhere else. I paid it, so I did accept the cost, but let people know so they can make a choice before arriving.

Lastly, while waiting I learned they offer AAA discounts. I noted having AAA. Original estimate was over $900. What you see is the updated estimate with AAA included.

*I'm glad others have had such great experiences here. I did not and will not sugarcoat my experience, nor will I be rude about it either.

She was very pleased with the services she had gotten from them and I trusted her good judgement. She was not lying when she said they had great customer service, I walked in w/o an appointment and at first glance the office is very clean and tidy.
I was greeted as soon as I walked in and one of the handsome gentlemen sat me down and asked me what was going on with my vehicle.
They had some time that day to take my car -so they got me registered and communicated with me what the initial inspection would entail plus the pricing. I agreed to the services and they even provided me with a ride back to my home which was a nice added perk.
Even the gentleman, Issac, who drove me home was very personable and respectful. I felt very safe. They had my car inspected and the issue resolved in a day, it was quick and painless and that’s how I like to do business. I will surely be back in the future.< /Text>< Pics>

I scheduled a pre-purchase inspection with Nick, and told him before the owner showed up with the vehicle that the owner was using high-pressure tactics and that I was nervous about it.  When the car arrived Nick immediately checked the computer to see if any codes had been wiped, and checked the odometer reading.  Sure enough, the odometer had been messed with and the car had over 230,000 miles on it, not 130,000!  Nick was so kind and didn’t charge me for the service as it was pretty quick.  He really saved me from buying a *very* old used car!!!  I can’t thank him enough.  Would give this place and Nick more than 5 stars if I could!<//text>

< review>
They did amazing work. Initially just needed an alignment. Ended up needed to replace a front right hub and ball bearing housing group. Anytime I go to a corporate business I’m always skeptical that they’re just trying to get my funds. (That’s why I always go local like these guys Aero auto Repair) These guys literally showed me the busted part from my vehicle to make me feel warm inside. I do all my own car work so I’m pretty critical of mechanics when I have to take it in, and I have to say after 7 years in San Diego, this is probably the best work I’ve ever had done!<//review>

< review>
I picked this place for the high rating and  will admit the customer service was pretty good and that’s the only reason they got one star. However the customer service doesn’t makeup for breaking other parts of the car that weren’t  broken when I dropped it off. Better yet, I’m then required to pay for something they broke. What is this trickery???  When I brought this up I was told well it was going to break anyway...but we won’t charge you labor.
Way to expensive, Just a car diagnostic costed me 140 dollars!
There’s many other car shops that are cheaper, just as good, and have integrity, so go there!<//review>

{'time': 1607369854599, 'text': "Thank You for the review Ms. Chantal... Please allow me to clarify the event that took place with your vehicle. Your vehicle came in for a no start condition, after attempting to start the diagnostic process the Technician quickly verified you had no battery power, Tech went out to open your hood and your Plastic hood latch completely crumbled while pulling the handle in the direction its intended for. unfortunately nowadays there are a lot of plastic items in today's vehicles and with heat and cold temperatures the dynamics of an item can drastically change. We apologize for the inconvenience. We tried our best to accomodate you by selling you the part at wholesale and installing it free of charge. We staff Master ASE Certified Technicians and provide a 3 year /36,000 mile Nationwide warranty. If you would like to further speak about the matter please feel free to reach out at (858) 467-9999\n\nTony"}</response>

Replaced a fuel pump assembly on my 2005 Nissan Sentra with 408,000 miles!
I guess I got the most out of the original fuel pump. They were very professional and timely. I was not thrilled with the $630 cost. It's worth it if can get another 400k miles. Good job Aero Auto Repair.< /review>

<Review>Made an appointment for an oil change for the next day, got accepted, dropped off my car and said i could pick it up anytime before 5pm. I called about 30 minutes after dropping off my car (at 7:15 am) and asked if there was anyway I could get it done before noon. They said they'd get back to me and they did and vwalah, my car was done by 12. Super Impressed by their speediness and friendliness. My family and I have been using Aero Auto since I was a child and I am still proud to use them as my mechanic. Highly recommend to all!< /Review>< Date>

Brought our 2006 Chevy Suburban here for a couple oil changes and u- joints and shaft drive. Price was  reasonable and customer service is great. Love their waiting area. Can keep kids entertained with toys, tv and snacks while waiting for car repairs. Keep up the great work!< /Text>

I have been taking my Dodge ram van to Aero for three years and I have always received great service and work. Randy is great at explaining what is going on and what to do about it. Every technician and mechanic I have talked to has been very patient explaining and answering my questions. I will continue to go there and recommend Aero to everyone.</Review>

I had given up hope for my 2010 Jeep Patriot. I was a little hesitant about spending the money required to get her back up and running. Aero Auto Repair made my baby feel like new again. Resolved every issue I had and then some!! I was always up to date about what was going on and delivery was sooner that expected. I highly recommend Aero Auto Repair to any and everyone looking to get their car serviced!!<//Review>

Made an appointment last night for 9 this morning, dropped my car off and got a call just before 4 that it was done. They were very upfront about pricing as well. I went in pretty sure of the problem and they called to confirm what I thought without trying to sell me on any other services. Will definitely be coming here for any future issues.<//Text>

<Pictures>None<//Pictures><Text>I love my Nissan Frontier Truck ( 01 ) but from the day I Purchased it New from Mossy Nissan in Kearny Mesa it’s always had a engine oil leak around the main oil seal. Mossy Nissan could never find the leak, someone painted a yellow mark on between the transmission and the oil pan but still no repairs were offered to repair my brand new Nissan Frontier. Fast forward a 100 k miles and now I have a fu*** mess on my hand. In addition the valve cover gaskets no longer seal any more, now hot engine oil is draining on my exhaust manifold and starting to think about a potential engine compartment fire 🔥.  Ok so long story short so two between Mossy Nissan and Advantec auto repair on Adams Ave, I not only lost money but I don’t want to buy another Nissan Truck. And so  I thank Aero Auto Repair for fixing the whole fuc*** problem for a UCSD front line worker who was down for the count. You rock 🥊<//Text>< date>

<review>This is a great shop. I needed an oil change and smog and took my car here and am amazed they were able to get the car to pass. They also did a full inspection and noticed a few things that needed attention but could wait a few months. I was very grateful they didn't try to upsell me or give me the run around. I am on a budget and they took that into consideration and made sure my car is road ready and safe. I really appreciate you guys. I will definitely be a regular customer from now on.... Hope you guys enjoyed the chips and drinks.</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>{'time': 1592590085976, 'text': 'Wow Thank You David !!

<Review>Chase was respectful and kept me apprised of all the issues prior to doing the work. He tried and succeeded in saving me money and was accommodating in picking up and dropping off my car. If Chase is any indication of the work the mechanic performed on my car, I should give them 5 plus stars. However,  I just got the car back and I won't know how it is for a little while. In the meantime I couldn't have asked to be treated any better. I appreciate that.<//Review>< date>

With the current health and employment situation on hand no one has extra time and especially extra money to waste! My husband and myself took my car in with a charging system problem. After my car was diagnose, fixed and I paid $250 dollars. The Original problem arise again 5 minutes later while I was driving back home. When I went back to them the car needed to be diagnose again and they mention that I needed to pay $650 dollars more for a different repair. When I mention that I wasted time and money for the first recommend repair that did not fix the Original problem. They mention that the best they could do is give me a Whopping $25 dollar discount for the next recommended repair. They showed No responsibility at all for my car being Misdiagnose the first time! What lack of quality, value and professionalism! Side note: I paid $330 dollars for the same job Aero Auto Repair was charging me $650. Don't let them Rip You Off!</Text>

<Rating>5</Rating><text>When I decided I didn’t know it all and that I needed professional help, I almost went to a psychologist, but then I remembered that it was my Toyota Sienna that needed attention. I was immediately and warmly greeted by Randy as I walked into the door. I told him my issues and managed to slip in some personal ones and he wore the two hats very well and made me feel like I was safe. No pressure, just a pleasure meeting and talking with Randy and Nick that I scheduled an appointment for the next day. Next day, 8am, was greeted by Nick who checked me in as I told him my issues. We shared some laughs, and again I felt safe and respected. Even more was the Lyft ride home as they worked, the personal delivery of my apartment keys when I realized I left them at the shop, and another Lyft ride back to the shop (the last Lyft ride I paid for because it was only fair). Back at the shop I was greeted again by Randy and master technician Joe who took me out on a drive and answered my questions with real kindness and Napa Know How. Now my van is fixed, and at half the price I was quoted because that’s all my van needed. These people are committed to honesty and integrity and it shows, and now my trust in people have been this much renewed. I love these people, and I love this place, and I take pleasure in recommending them to my friends, family, and acquaintances. Thank you all. I am thankful. David<//text>< Pictures>

< Review>
Aero Auto Repair was just what I needed to fix my A/C system that would mysteriously run out of freon once a year, and my service rep Chase gave me great customer service every step of the way. Aside from the fact that they actually found the problem instead of dismissing it like the Honda dealer did, they did the following great things:

* Honored a coupon for free A/C inspection
* Arranged for rides home from the shop
* Made sure I was clear on my options
* Had a nice, clean waiting area with comfy recliners (although we can't wait in the lobby right now because of COVID)
* Called my insurance company on my behalf to arrange for direct billing through them
* Gave me great customer service (thanks Chase!)

My only complaint was the length of time it took for diagnosis and then fixing, so my car spent about 4 full days there. They are a very busy shop, so make an appointment and have plans for alternative transportation. But also it could have been the complexity of my issue. They did a very thorough job of inspecting the entire vehicle and left several recommendations for return maintenance. And I will very likely be back :)<//Review>

<text>Gary & Sharon -  It's been a while since I brought cars into your Aero shop... The work (battery and electrical system check) on my son's Passat was done efficiently.  My Passat was sold over a year ago - hence the lack of regular visits.  I've bought a new Acura RDX and would like to have you service it rather than trusting the dealership and their price structure ...  Do you work on RDXs also..... knowing that your beginnings were Datsun Zs and have expanded greatly since then.  "Hi!" to all....   JE</text><Rate>4<//Rate></record></dataset><record>

<time>1583291793499</time><Review>I believe that from a quality and professional standpoint Aero Auto Repair is truly a wonderful repair shop and always tries their best. They are very thorough with their inspections and recommendations, and always try to put the safety of their customers and their vehicles first. I would say that they are priced a bit steeper than most, however I can see that they provide increased value for what they charge. Looking forward to future visits.</Review>< Rating>

I had the best customer experience anyone could ask for at Aero Auto. My car wasn’t going to make it back to Arizona (from San Diego), and I knew it was in desperate need of service. I received prompt service, a great price, and the mechanic came out to explain what was wrong with my car (which is rare at any other auto shop).  Everyone from the wonderful folks at the front, the mechanics, and the Owner are awesome to work with. They even checked on me to make sure I made it back to Arizona safely.  You don’t get this kind of customer experience anymore and it’s nice to know there are professional, honest, and caring people in the auto service world. I wish I could take all my vehicles to Aero Auto!

This is my first review of any place ever, and they are truly worthy of the best reviews!!< /Text>

<Text>They did a great job repairing my breaks and I was able to get my car fixed up for my move within a day.

Unfortunately, I had forgotten to use my coupon which would have saved me 50$ on the job. I tried to get it retroactively added onto it the next day and they said they couldn't do that since the invoice was closed. Wish they could have accommodated me somehow since I will be moving and won't be able to use this coupon in the future.< /Text><Name>Cristian Ramirez< /Name><time>1597244829403<//time>< Rating>

For the first time, I trusted car mechanics working on my car. Their work and transparency with every single aspect of the job entrusted to them are unmatchable. Not to mention how polite and easygoing the staff is! Very punctual and professional.
Huge shoutout to Nick, Chase, and Mark.

In 2017 when I first got out here they called the repair shop in Norfolk on my behalf and got the alternator that was busted warrantied and comped. When I needed the car worked on before a upcoming PCS trip they told me what i needed and what could wait. They are honest and fair and my favorite shop I’ve ever been to.< /text>

Randy was so helpful. He picked up my car and delivered it after service. And the bill was less than he quoted because my vehicle apparently has a different type of set up so the transmission flush wasn't as complicated. I appreciate them not overcharging me once they learned what needed to be done.<//text>

< Review>
After spending $2500 fixing my vehicle on during first visit, I was given a $50 off "gift card" as a show of their appreciation for my business, expiry 3/31. A few months go by, and I bring my car in for an inspection. Turns out the cost of repair would be much more than the value of the car ($4400) and I decide against repairs. I go in to pick up my car and attempted to use my gift card to shave a little off (being potentially out of a car... I need every dollar I can get at this point), but since they "did not do any repairs", they would not accept the gift card. Hold up. What? So I got charged $375 and this place did next to NOTHING to my car? Sounds like they have some legit mechanics who really care about returning customers!

I could not recommend this place to anyone. What an absolute joke.<//Review>

<Text>I would prefer to give them 0. They quoted my repairs which are 200% more than the car value. I was told that it takes about 10 days to fix it. Just for diagnosing the issue, they charged 140$ later I got to know that there are bunch of other body shops who will do the diagnosis for free. Thank god, I found one and fixed my car in a day with 200% less than what these guys quoted.<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>{'time': 1582938737738, 'text': 'Please allow me to clarify... you came in with your Toyota Camry wanting Aero Auto Repair to diagnose your drivability issue, we did exactly what you requested.

Great experience all the way around! Company goes out of their way to ensure the customer is taken care of. The towing service I was referred to by this company was RJs Towing, they only charged me $60 for a tow to the shop, which is a great value and he was equally friendly! Very comfortable waiting area.<//review>

(*I would Highly recommend this establishment*)

I waited to tell about my experience to make sure all repairs where good. Overall im very happy with the Areo team they worked with me in getting all my repairs done and would not return my car until they where A1 good to go. The only thing that kept them from getting 5 stars from me is the fact the vehicle techs dont keep their admintative halfs informed on the work performed.  so that means if someone is no longer working there then no one knows the progress of the vehicle which happen to me. Areo Auto went threw great lengths to fixs this problem.</review>

Nissan tech "Mark" was as advertised, professional and very experienced.
Mark is actually the 1st mechanical tech I have ever used to work on my Nissan 350Z.<//Text>

Do yourself a favor and stay away from this place! Long story short, after I wasted time and money for repairs I did Not Need to fix the Original problem because they Misdiagnosed. They expect you to pay full prize for parts and labor the second time around! Oh I'm sorry, they did offer me a Huge $25 dollar discount. That is what I call being professional! Oh by the way, the prize from Aero Auto Repair for repairs the second time around on the Original problem $650 other shop $330. Don't waste your time and money on this place!< /review>

One of my concerns was two of the mechanics , Mark and Tod, I'd grown to know, like and respect may have left so I was more than pleased to know they were still there at my last visit.

If I could negative this place I would! I DO NOT RECOMMEND THEM! I took my vehicle in for an engine leak and the mechanic said since he had my engine out too long that when he put it back in, it fried my computer system and that I was financially responsible for an additional $1600 repair because of his mistakes. He said they had it out too long because they were delivered the wrong part twice. And they did NOT communicate any of their delivery issues with me at all until I called them to let them know I was on my way to pick it up at the time they told me to come. I almost had a heart attack. Dealing with the owner was not the best either. He said the best he can do is not charge me labor to replace my computer system. Ha! Such a joke! So if you  are ok with them destroying your vehicle by all means yes go here. Otherwise I wouldn't trust me at ALL! A complete scam! If I was the type of person to sue them, I totally would!<//Review>

<Text>I was struck by how tidy and well kept the office was! The environment is clean and organized, with ample seating for customers, books and television and a few small items for children. There was attentive staff at the counter upon arrival, who greeted me cheerfully.
Ericka and Nick explained thoroughly and clearly what they believed was wrong with my car, and then Nick took the time to explain it all a second time over the phone for my husband!
I was offered coffee while I waited (always a plus) in a very neat and comfortable customer lounge.
Ericka kept me updated throughout the duration of my visit so I wasn't sitting clueless for any extended period of time.
In the end, I walked out with exactly what was necessary for less than I'd anticipated and experienced excellence in customer service!

Thanks Aero Auto Repair,

<review>Had my motor home serviced as well as a number of needed repairs at Aero Auto Repair. The quality of repairs was outstanding. The cost, well below that quoted  by the dealer. The staff was professional and friendly and kept me up to date as they progressed through the repairs.

I brought my daughters boyfriend in after he began having problems with his vehicle. Took it to the dealer and they quoted $2,500 to replace the clutch. Aero Auto evaluated the problem and replaced the clutch to the tune of $1,600, with a warranty three times that offered by the dealer. The staff was again professional, friendly and efficient.

Finally, yesterday I brought my daughters car in to evaluate the problem from a “check engine” light. Aero Auto Repair diagnosed the problem and quickly made the repairs. A similar repair at the dealer cost twice as much as Aero Auto charged.

Quality service, professional and friendly staff and affordable prices. If you are looking for service or repairs and are tired of paying dealer prices, Aero Auto Repair is the place to go.</review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

We are dedicated to our customers and value their responses as it aids in making the needed adjustments to stay a sustainable business. We sincerely apologize that your expectations were not met. We always provide transparency to our customers to build maximum customer engagement. We quoted and performed a charging system inspection based on your concern. Our ASE Certified Master Technician confirmed 3 issues during our testing process. There was a severed wire at the battery current sensor and a poor connection at the positive battery terminal. Additionally, the used alternator that you installed in your vehicle was found to be under charging at 11.4 volts. We recommended wiring repair for the battery current sensor, replacement of the positive battery terminal and replacement of the alternator. All of these recommendations were strictly made to address the charging issue. You declined the alternator replacement and battery terminal replacement and were advised that the wiring repair alone would not repair your vehicle. When you came to pick up your vehicle you were advised it still wouldn’t start without a jump due to the poor battery connection and insufficient voltage from the charging system. We understand everyone has a budget, which is why we offer financing with Synchrony Bank. Approving only one of the 3 critical recommendations pertaining to your concern will unfortunately not fully resolve the problem. I am extremely sorry we let you down and hope you will accept my deepest apologies. Please let me know if there is anything I can do to earn your trust and business in the future.\n\nSincerely,\nTony Kaju of Aero Auto Repair'}</Resp>< gmapID>

They are very patient and understanding. What was supposed to take almost a week, they finished within a day.

The staff is welcoming, friendly , accommodating and easy to work with.  Aero Auto Repair provides the services/makes the repairs that are necessary without gouging you. If they advise work that needs to be done they will  help you prioritize the work as to what needs to be done now and what can wait.  I love this place!</review>< pics>

< Review>
The receptionist, Erika, was wonderful in accommodating me during my visit to Aero Auto.  She checked my car in promptly had the mechanic checking concerns I had about my car.  Clinton, my mechanic, was prompt in sharing his checklist of jobs needed and the order in which the repairs need to be taken care of on my car in the near future.  My car is running even better since Clinton changed my car’s oil and filter.

The atmosphere and customer service at Aero Auto is always fantastic!!! I truly appreciate the care that they give my car and the service they give me each time I have had to take my car in for repairs. Thanks a million!!!< /Review>

Positive side is they have great receptionist and customer service.  Erika is Amazing!  Negative is wait time and price.  I waited 2 hours for an oil change and was charged $12 for labor (between $42-44 total-oil changes are usually $30 at most mechanic shops).  This was just my experience</review>

I am so glad that I discovered Aero Auto Repair !  It has been a few years now and they have always done impeccable work on my car, the staff are wonderful and I love the fact that they will explain exactly what the repair is, the cost and how important it is to safe driving... Very impressive !
Most garages that I have worked with in the past were definitely not so honest and treated me like an idiot because I am a woman !
The other wonderful thing about Aero Auto Repair is their reception and waiting area so comfortable and clean, with coffee and water available.
and lovely clean restroom!< /Review>

My car (which I recently purchased last year) has been going dead after replacing with a new battery/a day or two of driving and we didn’t know why this was happening. I’ve had a couple of places check it out and neither were able to give me a definitive diagnosis. I was stressing out because this was my first big purchase on my own and I was so excited for my first car and to find out it’s having problems already after a few months of driving it? I was convinced I had bought myself a lemon and I just couldn’t believe it. Unfortunately, the warranty already expired once the problems arose so I had to plan for spending some money. After a recommendation to Aero, I was astounded by the amazing customer service they had, especially Erika and David! They went out of their way to ensure they could find the problem and my car was being difficult but they ultimately found the problem and told me about it- it was a problem with the second key fob (as I was only given one at the time of purchase). We went over the options and chose the best one and although the problem wasn’t completely fixed, they showed me an effective way to get my car started. The price wasn’t too bad given my situation. It would’ve been a lot more if I had gone somewhere else. Diagnosis/testing was $133 and to get my key reprogrammed was $250 so the combined total wasn’t too bad! My car is a difficult one, but everyone was really helpful and I just loved their friendly and homey atmosphere. I definitely recommend their service! I can’t thank you enough!<//review>

<Review>As some other reviews point out, this is not the shop to take your car if you need a well trained mechanic to help diagnose an issue. They will pull engine codes and fix what the car tells them to but I get the sense that the mechanics are mainly young and inexperienced. Don't expect much help with unknown issues but do expect them to charge $60 just to plug in that code reader.< /Review><Date>1576868233287<//Date><user>114969684741570763271</user><response>{'time': 1547246069783, 'text': 'Hello Lauren, I would like to speak with you about your concerns but I was unable to find you in our database.

<review>As some other reviews point out, this is not the shop to take your car if you need a well trained mechanic to help diagnose an issue. They will pull engine codes and fix what the car tells them to but I get the sense that the mechanics are mainly young and inexperienced. Don't expect much help with unknown issues but do expect them to charge $60 just to plug in that code reader.</review><pictures>None</pictures><Response>{'time': 1547246069783, 'text': 'Hello Lauren, I would like to speak with you about your concerns but I was unable to find you in our database.

<Review>My car (which I recently purchased last year) has been going dead after replacing with a new battery/a day or two of driving and we didn’t know why this was happening. I’ve had a couple of places check it out and neither were able to give me a definitive diagnosis. I was stressing out because this was my first big purchase on my own and I was so excited for my first car and to find out it’s having problems already after a few months of driving it? I was convinced I had bought myself a lemon and I just couldn’t believe it. Unfortunately, the warranty already expired once the problems arose so I had to plan for spending some money. After a recommendation to Aero, I was astounded by the amazing customer service they had, especially Erika and David! They went out of their way to ensure they could find the problem and my car was being difficult but they ultimately found the problem and told me about it- it was a problem with the second key fob (as I was only given one at the time of purchase). We went over the options and chose the best one and although the problem wasn’t completely fixed, they showed me an effective way to get my car started. The price wasn’t too bad given my situation. It would’ve been a lot more if I had gone somewhere else. Diagnosis/testing was $133 and to get my key reprogrammed was $250 so the combined total wasn’t too bad! My car is a difficult one, but everyone was really helpful and I just loved their friendly and homey atmosphere. I definitely recommend their service! I can’t thank you enough!</Review>< Pics>

I was delighted when he opened his own business, and even more delighted when he moved to his new location close by our house.  I have brought all my cars, both foreign and domestic, to Gary and Sharon for over a quarter of century!  They are good people.  It's fun to see that even with a full staff of professionals at his modern facility, Gary is still hands on and occasionally seen under the hood, grin.

The big thing to me, and why I would unhesitatingly recommend Aero Auto Repair, is the honesty, integrity, and care we have received over the years.   It is said that "Those businessmen will prosper whose business protects as their own the interests of others"  (From the Tirukkural, a famous south Indian poem).  This must be the motto of everyone at Aero Auto because they do not try to sell you something you do not need. The options are presented and the explanations are clear..  We have always been treated like family and I'm sure all their customers feel the same..

I no longer drive my beloved 280Z, I had to retire it after 37 years of faithful service, and even in this painful transition (turned in to the state for recycling), putting the old girl down, Gary and Sharon were there to support me.

My 3 other cars (Mercedes, Mazda, Ford) may or may not last to the ripe old age of 37, but I'm completely secure in the feeling that they will always be well cared for.< /Text>< pictures>

My first visit to AERO Auto was for a brake check. I was so impressed by their attention and caring.  They are so thorough with  photos of the tech that worked on your car and constant follow up after your visit.  I needed my oil changed and went straight back to AERO.   Their work & customer service is unbeatable. I'm so glad I tried them.   They are definitely my "go to" auto repair.</review>

<review>I went to this auto shop before for a repair when my check engine light came on. I spoke to representative who did seem to come off initially as being busy but in person she was actually very kind. I worked with Dave for most of my communication and he was also very genuine and transparent in cost. When I got to the auto repair shop I realized that they were actually pretty busy and I was immediately impressed by how well they were able to manage their work load and still take care of me as a customer.

Without prompting Dave positioned the idea of reaching out to my warranty company for any repairs that could be covered. He directly called them on my behalf and gave me hourly updates on anything efforts that needed my approval. I really appreciated that. They got my car in and out the same day!!! I was able to pass my inspection that weekend and my engine light has not given me any problems since then.

So 10 months later, today I had an issue with my coolant system and had my vehicle towed to Aero repair based on the rapport I built with Dave. The experience started off well.

After getting a diagnostics on the repair needed I spoke with a representative about my quote for initial repairs. We discussed costs and seeing that I was not comfortable with the cost of repairs the conversation began to feel a bit rushed. I did not feel too good about the conversation.

I called back to express my hesitation and my discourse about the conversation with the rep on the phone. Dave picked up the phone this time. It was indeed a smoother conversation. Dave sympathized with my concerns and the thoughts of having to pay a costly, unexpected repair, and took the time to explain and educate me on the necessary repairs in detail. He really made it simple and touched on the hard work that he and his fellow colleagues do everyday.

The convo with Dave gave me knew perspective and I appreciated the time. I consented to the repairs, which turned out not to be that costly over all. I had my car the next day by 12pm. The representative that I had the snag with over the phone apologized in person without prompting, I shook hands with everyone at the front desk, and my repairs were completed flawlessly. We all are people, work can push us at times, and we are all customers somewhere. It's how we handle these moments that make us great!!! (added learning experience)

I really appreciate this repair shop for taking the time to understand my needs, for being big enough to take ownership and accountability over my customer experience, and for still being humble enough to value me as a customer. They even had the owner of the shop, Sharon, reach out to me to follow up. Dave also followed up with me one week later to see how the car was running. They have a great team at Aero repair!!!! I greatly recommend this repair shop!!!< /review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>{'time': 1555956948117, 'text': 'Thank you! So happy we could resolve your issue and get you back on the road.

I feel like I've found the repair shop I can trust. Finally! The day I went in, I needed only an oil change on my Ford Escape. Well, they found a leak under the hood. But instead of just jumping in and charging me a bunch of money, they said to come back in 2,000 miles to see the results of a dye test to narrow down the cause of the leak and save me some repair expense. Awesome! I appreciate people who do honest work and I will give them my business!

Erika was my service rep. Smart and nice. Made me feel like I was in good hands. I really knew I liked this place when she offered me coffee and popcorn! VERY clean place, decorated with flowers and a lava lamp. Who does that?

Good vibe here. They earned five stars.< /review>

<Review>I was referred here by my longtime mechanic because my 1982 Corvette was failing smog & nobody could figure it out.  I met Ryan at the service desk & was immediately impressed not only by his knowledge of cars, but his enthusiasm & eagerness to take care of my car.  He gave me a preliminary estimate for diagnostics and scheduled the appointment.

The car was promptly taken back & Mark the mechanic started the diagnostics.
I had decided to wait for the car and found this place to be very customer focused. It's clean, has free WiFi, comfy couches in the waiting area, books, magazines, a clean ladies restroom stocked with quality amenities including  complimentary ladies items (where do you see that?) and a baby changing station, a kids play area with a table and chairs & toys, free coffee, big screen TV, and nice music playing,

During my stay here I listened to and talked with Ryan & Lynette at the service desk, and also met Sharon, who is the owner of this shop.  She gives all the credit for my compliments to her team of outstanding employees.  I like cars and like talking about cars, but these people love cars and love their customers.  Everyone here took the time to make me feel confident & comfortable and answer all of my questions, and explain what was happening with, and found on my car.

Back to Mark, my mechanic, he found an under performing sensor on my car, and replaced it, and it passed smog YAHOO!  Mark also talked to me about some other things that he found that need some attention.

I would without hesitation recommend Aero Auto Repair to anyone who wants to enjoy their automotive repair experience.</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

<review>Definitely thorough. Highly recommend. They personally took me out to my car (which they had lifted up) to show me underneath my car and the few bolts that were missing that were supposed to be there holding up my bumper, a small nail in my tire, and then that i was missing a battery harness.  There was no particular reason i was bringing in my car other than i had wanted it checked as i had just bought it. The fact that they had only found a few small things out of the 50 point check they had performed shows how thorough they were.  It has been a month and a half since i had last brought my car in and everything is running great. Great customer service, and great pricing. Again, definitely recommended.< /review>< resp>

I've been coming to Aero Auto Repair since back when they were called Z-wizz (they specialized in Datsun Z's). Excellent, knowledgeable,  people. High-quality service, top notched and they won't stear you wrong. At least that's been my experience. I highly recomend Aero Automotive.</text>

Dave, Erica and the rest of the team at Aero Auto Repair do a phenomenal job every time. The quality of work and friendliness of the staff are the best I've seen. Fair and honest pricing beats the dealership everytime. I will continue to bring my vehicles there for all my repairs needs.< /Review>

Just don't ever go here. They had my car for a month to get me past smog. All that was replaced was the fuel pump - apparently that takes a whole month. Also, the breaks weren't stopping correctly and they recommended i replace the breaks that was just done 6 months ago at a cost of $1000. Took it to a better shop, and he determined i had low pressure in the lines (a $200 fix). Thus, with Aero i would have been out $1000 to realize that was not the issue - David said "well i guess we'll just have to see". A thousand dollars to fix NOTHING!!! Never called back when they said the would. When i called they would transfer me to 4 different employees to figure out what was going on with my car. It was as if they have only been open a week and are still getting systems in place - yet they have been in business for years (god knows how)<//text>

Have been an Aero customer for years and have always been treated honestly and fairly. Last week was just confirmed more good service.<//Text>< Gmap_id>

Aero Auto Repair has some of the best customer service I have seen in any industry. We ended up at their shop after an improper repair elsewhere caused additional damage to our vehicle. They were thorough and clear with the assessments and filed the necessary claims against the previous shop's warranty company on our behalf. With multiple phone calls, questions, and requests, they were always ready and willing to help in any way possible. They will definitely be getting our business for all future auto needs.<//Text>

Pride themselves as family friendly - have a nice waiting area, movies etc. Not the cheapest, but do quality work for fair prices. Cars and small trucks mostly - they can only do some repairs on larger vehicles and campers due to low roof.< /text>< rating>

<rate>1< /rate><Text>My service was not good here. One month and $1000 later, my vehicle STILL DOES NOT WORK. I was allowed to drive an inoperable vehicle onto public roadways, with you knowing the vehicle was unsafe to drive. You are not clear with progress. And it is absurd to charge diagnostic fee after diagnostic fee.
I just took my vehicle to another AAA represented shop...and they WAIVED the diagnostic fees because I explained and complained about the lack of professionalism I had just been served at Aero Auto. So this business sees value in my business and offered a free diagnostic just to ensure they got the job for the repair. Since I was hooked, you guys knew you had me. I explained how all of a sudden there were more problems that were never there before. And if these issues are not cause or results of the breakdown that brought me into the shop in the first place, then what is reality? Because people that don't know usually won't question.
I have reported to the Better Business Bureau, AAA, ASE as well as to the offices of Kevin Faulconer. And now to you. Once results of the new shops diagnosis come in, I will follow up with all those companies, as well as to you so you can judge the incompetence for yourself.<//Text><Response>{'time': 1517267787905, 'text': "Hello Eric, First and foremost we would like to apologize for your less than satisfactory experience with us.

The testing and troubleshooting process was interrupted when the car was picked up in need of further repairs. Despite replacing preliminary parts to determine the cause of the problem it was determined that there were other items that needed to be addressed. Again, our apologies for your distress after receiving your vehicle with limited repairs accompanied with caution in operating the vehicle. While the van was in our care, it was not driven on the street. Only on our private lot. This information was communicated to you when you indicated you wanted to take the car home until you were able to continue with the recommended repairs. We expressed our concerns that the van might not make it to your home. Again, we are very sorry for the anxiety and stress this caused you. Going forward, If we can be of assistance to the current repair facility regarding diagnostic procedures performed, please have them contact us to speak with our technician directly."}</Response><UserId.>104565611838709026373< /UserId.><Time>1517253100985<//Time><username>Eric Zangroniz</username><pics>None</pics></record></dataset><record>

They included me in the process of the work needed to be done on my car, valued that I already know the issue; they assessed the root cause and fixed it quickly and reasonably priced. The facility was so nice as well to wait in. I highly recommend this place I talked with a guy named David at the front counter<//review>

Update to previous review: How do you negotiate with somebody who operates in bad faith? If only it Tony was capable of telling a true and complete story. Tony left out him trying to extort $2050 for storage which is almost double what is allowed by law. He left out that he never properly notified the vehicle owner because his secretary didn't update the records after being given the correct information. He certainly didn't take any responsibility for his poor communication and straight out bullying. If you have read this far, I am serious. Stay away from this place. The new owner, Tony, is trying to ride on Gary and Sharon A.'s reputation in the community, but he is just what you would expect from the worst quality shop in the business. Protect yourself so you don't have to hire an attorney like I did.</review>

<text>Brought in an RX-8 for a compression test. Test was completed on time and the rotary tech came out to discuss a few other items I asked them to check/advise. Very helpful. Cannot speak to effectiveness of any repiars but, if you want to a spot that will work on your rotary to Mazda's spec, this seems a decent spot. They did say they will not rebuild, only replace your motor with a factory engine. Makes sense if they need to warranty their work but, that's a little disappointing.<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

<review>Taking my car in for repairs and service is not one of my favorite things to do, but it's easy with Aero Auto!  The front desk people are so nice when I drop my car off and are very good about calling me with updates.  After repairs and/or service, my car drives so much better!  It's a pleasure to drive after Aero Auto has worked on my car.  Thank you to everyone there for good service and for being so pleasant.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

Love this place! They provided excellent customer service experience. David did a great job making me feel comfortable paying the fee for inspecting the problem with my break lights. Sure enough, the lights were fixed in no time and the price out the door was cheap!

On top of that, they have a nice waiting area (comfy couches, free food! (popcorn, candy, etc.), and really nice bathrooms). My fiancé told me she really liked the bathroom as it catered well to ladies, which shows that Aero Auto Repair goes above and beyond just being a auto shop.

Overall great experience and would recommend for others to check out. Keep up the great work guys!<//Review>

I have been going to this shop for years and always have a great experience!  They really care about making their customers feel comfortable.

As a woman, I have always dreaded auto repair because it usually means going into scuzzy shops with scuzzy guys trying to tell you there are a million things wrong with your car.  But not here!  This shop is the cleanest shop I've ever been in and they are always very honest.  They let you know all the things that need to be fixed right away along with the things that may need to be fixed in the future.  But there is never any pressure to do anything more than what you want done.  Then as they do the repairs they keep you updated on the status so you're never wondering what's going on.

Also, I've been in for something small before where I just waited in the office and it is very cool in there.  There are comfortable couches, a large TV with cable and Netflix, and an electronics docking station so you can plug in your phone or laptop.  It's a very comfortable place to hang out while you're waiting.  I was able to feed and play with my baby and when I realized I had forgotten my diaper bag, the owner even had a stash of diapers for emergencies like that!  And they have a changing table in the bathroom which is very cool (You'd be surprised how many places do not have changing tables...).  Anyway, as a woman, I just feel very confident in taking my car here.

Everyone here is so friendly and helpful and the work on my car is always great!  I recommend this shop to all my friends and would never take my car anywhere else!< /review>

<rate>5<//rate><Text>I make it a point to keep up with maintenance on my car, which is a 2008 Nissan 350Z. I took it to the dealer for an oil change at 68,200 miles. They came back with about $1400 in services I supposedly needed. One of those services was a "slight oil leak in passenger side valve gasket". Another service was to have the spark plugs changed. They wanted $450 for the "leak" and $550 to change the spark plugs. I took the car back and headed for Aero Auto. I was a previous customer but hadn't been to them in awhile because I moved out of the area. Aero Auto thoroughly inspected my car, including all the things the dealer claimed it needed. David informed me that the spark plugs don't need to be changed until at least 100,000 miles, and the "leak" was just a couple of spots of oil on the top of the engine. He pulled the pan from under the car and it was completely dry with no oil on it, so there was no evidence of a leak. I was told my car was pristine and in excellent condition. After some routine flushes and an alignment I walked out paying less than half what the dealer wanted to charge me. I'll drive the extra distance to trust my car to Aero Auto for the life of my car. I'll also be taking my mother there for service on her Honda CRV! The staff is warm and friendly as well.<//Text>< Pics>

Amazing customer service and an HONEST business.  I have had nothing but great experiences at this repair shop and have sent several friends here.
Aero auto truly takes the time to explain what is wrong with your vehicle and what needs to be ordered/fixed.  They tell you honest scenarios and give you advice as to what they would do in your situation.
We all know cars are expensive and stressful when things go wrong, so it is a breath of fresh air when you find a mechanic you can trust.... especially as a female!!<//Review>

I was able to feed and play with my baby and when I realized I had forgotten my diaper bag, the owner even had a stash of diapers for emergencies like that!  And they have a changing table in the bathroom which is very cool (You'd be surprised how many places do not have changing tables...).  Anyway, as a woman, I just feel very confident in taking my car here.

Everyone here is so friendly and helpful and the work on my car is always great!  I recommend this shop to all my friends and would never take my car anywhere else!</review>< response>

My brother-in-law initially introduced us to Aero Auto Repair and we've been customers now for over 15 years.  The family-run operation is very friendly to male and female customers, and so helpful in making decisions as to what is "urgent" versus "soon" etc.  They have earned our trust and loyalty.< /text>

First of all I Went as a walk-in client and it was a good experience. I went to pep boys and they couldn’t figure out the problem it either. I needed my headlight fixed before dark but no technician there so I went to the nearest automobile shop I could find considering I am not from Aero drive. Nonetheless it was fun and I wished that there was no major repairs needed bc I only had about 130 dollars total, 60 of which was cash. The service all in all was: quick, easy, fast and smoooth. :)</review>

<text>So fast, so knowledgeable, so nice, so reasonably priced. The last place I took my car failed my smog, aero said they didn't see anything wrong and ran it through smog test without issue.

Other smog places will just pass or fail you, this place can fix the problem. Save your money, stop looking, and just go here.</text><user_id>113318290715676992084< /user_id><date>1529773806955</date>< name>

Ryan was very helpful, he applied the coupon I made my appointment with after I failed to mention it. The only thing they forgot was my oil change reminder sticker which isn't that big of a deal. I trust this place, you never feel as though they recommend things which are not necessary.  I have taken my car here 3 times now and have never been disappointed.

<Rating>1<//Rating><text>Way over priced ! Found out what I paid for was not done on my vehicle!...When I brought my truck in to see about the check engine light that had gone on, Erica explained to me that a full inspection along with diagnostics would be done for a $140 price (just to see a check engine light? No, she said a full inspection would be done on my vehicle so I agreed). I later received a call that my truck was ready to be picked up with a report, 2 hrs later when I came back to the facility.... and after arriving at the shop and waiting for the staff memeber to finish a text message... I then paied the fee for what was supposed to be done. After paying I asked how the inspection went. I was then informed by Erica that the inspection which was included in the price I paid wasn’t even completed! She had let me pay for something that wasn’t even done on my truck!  good thing I asked or it wouldn’t have been done at all! She then told me my truck was still in the shop and not ready for me to leave with but had called me 2 hr earlier o say it was ready to be picked up. She said that I could come back a different day if I wanted my full inspection to be done. Are you kidding me? ..Very very disappointed. Do not go here, over priced and they will let you pay for something that wasn’t done on your vehicle.</text>< Time>

I have worked at and managed repair shops all my life. I have always provided great customer service and this shop still exceeded my expectations! Not just one person, but EVERYONE at this shop has excellent customer service skills. I feel that if I was training a new hire I would first send them to Aero Auto to have their car serviced.
I have found that a repair shop is in a difficult position because everyone that walks through the door needs repairs or maintenance which was not in their monthly budget. Their car is the 2nd most important thing to them and when it breaks down their world comes to a grinding halt. As a repair shop adviser you generally do not talk to happy people which makes it difficult to turn the experience into a good one. This is where Aero Auto excels. Every time I left this place I was happier than when I went in. The fact that they take such good care of me shows they take great care of my car too.
If you are reading this, THERE IS NO REASON TO TAKE YOUR CAR ANYWHERE ELSE!<//review>

<text>I was looking for an auto repair shop to investigate a check engine light issue. After reading reviews online, I decided to take my car to Aero.

As far as the customer and vehicle service goes, I have only positive things to say. They were friendly,  knowledgeable, and fixed the issue. They even offered to pay for an uber/lyft back home and to the shop after service.

The only complaint I have is that the coupon I found online was for a free check engine "scan". Sure, they "scanned" it for free, but the "diagnostic" was $133. A bit of a bait and switch, but not enough to bring them down from a 5 star rating.

I'll definitely be back! (Hopefully not too soon, though)< /text>< pics>

DO NOT GO FOR A PRE-PURCHASE INSPECTION AT AERO AUTO REPAIR! . A truck I bought based on their report cost me so much money. They said the truck was great and nothing was wrong with it but couple of weeks later another, more reputable shop found several leaks and other issues, after I had bought the truck.< /text>
<Pics>None<//Pics><Response>{'time': 1519671653731, 'text': 'Allow me to address your concerns. On August 30th we inspected a 2007 Toyota Tacoma with 136,185 miles. It is very common for prepurchase inspections not to reveal active leaks if the vehicle had been cleaned before it was brought in to us. After it is driven for sometime it will then begin to show signs of leakage. Leaks can be minor to major. Our inspection did determine a front pinion seal leak, wheel bearing noise, a broken center console latch and a couple of other minor issues. There is a disclaimer on the estimate and the final invoice that states our findings are intended only for the vehicles condition at the time and date of the evaluation as leaks and breakdowns can happen at anytime without notice. I am very sorry you were not satisfied with our inspection but I hope you understand that a vehicle with that kind of mileage is bound to have issues as time goes on.'}<//Response><Gmap_id>0x80dbfe29eea6511b:0xd134acab28f3a16</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Quoted me over $1000 to fix an oil pan gasket. $335 labor for control arms. Way overpriced. The work i requested (Trans mount) was also high- $334 P&L. But they had my vehicle the entire day. Called me 20 minutes before closing on Friday to say they ordered the wrong part and my vehicle is still not put back together so it would not be available until Monday (did not offer to stay late /come in on Saturday). Then had the nerve to try and charge me the $60 inspection fee. Save yourself the hassle- go somewhere else or buy the parts yourself and watch YouTube tutorials.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>{'time': 1531764518390, 'text': "Hello Andrew.

After reading reviews I decided to take my truck in for inspection. Customer service communication is very poor. Complimentary inspection was not done on my truck. Don't waste your time here, there are other places very close by.<//review>

I’ve been a customer of Gary and Sharon for years. I know why they have been so successful. They care and they do not try to oversell me, they charge a fair price and get the job done. I ask to be treated as they would want to be treated and that’s the service I get. Other shops seem to take me for granted and treat me like they’re doing me a favor, but not the staff at Z Whizz (that’s how I think of them, I’ve been a customer since the El Cajon Blvd days).< /Review>

I have found the work above average on my autos and the atmosphere very comfortable with the internet, recliners and coffee.   I would have given 5 stars, but the internet was not available that day.  Fortunately, my car was done quickly so I did not have to wait hours looking staring into space.  Per the intake person internet had been out for quite some time.<//Review>

We have had two service events with AERO and they both have been very positive! We have a 1972 240Z that we have owned for decades and it has both functional and sentimental value to us. AERO breathed life back into it after it sat for years and we had it shipped from WA. It needed virtually everything and AERO addressed the issues and provided a very detailed documentary list of what was accomplished. AERO is one of the few repair facilities that deal with these cars and they came highly recommended. The second event was the return of a battery for the 240Z that failed within the warranty period. AERO very generously settled that issue as well. We will continue to use AERO for future repairs and plan to bring my wife's old 450SL in for an oil change. Thank you, AERO, for your excellent service!!< /text>

<review>This place prides itself in being "woman friendly". That should raise an alarm right there. I cant begin to explain to you how bad I was taken for a ride. Parts that they told me they could get from NAPA at a super cheap price...ended up being much much more than they should have. Example, a door handle for the inside of my car. I was charged 170 dollars for an aftermarket part when I could have went to the DEALERSHIP and got the same part for 40 dollars.

They constantly  tell you how they are going to take care of you, and assure you that everything will be a great deal and how you'll have your car in no time....I had to wait a week, I was ripped off incredibly hard and I was most certainly NOT taken care of.

Stay away from this place at all costs!!!! I have a funny feeling that most of these reviews are from friends, family and staff that work at Aero Auto Repair. There is no way they can have this many reviews.

Also, let me leave you with this....I had a valve that was leaking oil very badly and they told me they would fix it and change the gaskets (which is a time consuming task). Low and behold, I get home and notice there is SILICONE on my ENGINE. They put SILICONE to "try" and stop the leak!!!!

Thanks to these con artists, my engine is long gone and I'm having to shell out another 1300 for a new one.

If I could give these fools 0 stars...trust me, I most definitely would. Stay AWAY. Dear god, it is my mission to warn as many people as I can and deny them of ANY business. They have already went out of business a couple times....let's make sure the last time is the FINAL time.

DO YOURSELF A FAVOR and check out their YELP page before you make and rash decisions.< /review>< Time>

<Review>This place is great! The staff is very friendly and trustworthy! They have TV, snaks, soda, and even free wifi in the waiting area. It's very clean and welcoming. I have had my car in for service several times and can say that these people know what they are doing. I had an electrical problem in my BMW that was making it run very erratic and had 3 other shops tell me they could not figure out what was wrong. I brought my car to Aero Auto Repair and they were able to figure out and fix my problem that same day. I highly recommend this repair facility!< /Review>< response>

I recently purchased a used car and being a young working mom I rarely have time to take care of my car. I have also been to many auto shops and fallen victim to scare tactics to receive unnecessary work. I was able to walk in to Aero Auto and get my car in for an oil change and thorough check. Anna and Lynette were working the front desk and they were so sweet and understanding I had my 10 month old baby with me and they made the experience so nice. The waiting room is so comfortable its like your waiting at home while your car is being worked on. There are plently of nice toys for the little kids and netfix for the bigger kids. I was delighted to see the bathroom had a baby changing station that was neatly maintained with hygenic liners. The technicians discovered I needed a little extra work and Anna being a trained service advisor explained in detail the recommendations and estimated cost. I never felt suckered into extra costs and they were very patient while I got a hold of my husband to ensure he was fine with the cost. It took a bit longer than I had planned for, but it was a great experience and the whole team was friendly honest and kind. I was raised in a family where if you need any automotive work done you drive it home and dad does the work,  being too far from home I was delighted to have such an amazing experience with something as intimidating as automotive care is for me. Thank you everyone at Aero Auto.<//text>

Never taking my car here again. My car started exhibiting electrical problems and since the Napa battery was only 8 months old I didn't think it was the problem... turned out it was the battery after all. It took four hours for them to replace the battery (under warranty). They also replaced the short negative cable, which probably didn't need it, but they needed some way to justify the $148 they charged me! What a ripoff. Battery diagnosis is free everywhere else, and I could have just bought another battery and scrapped the first one for less money.</text>

It is difficult for me to understand exactly what happened as this was 2 years ago. When replacing a battery, if a cable is bad we recommend replacing it as it can keep the battery from charging properly. You were charged some diagnostic time and for the cable and installation. We always get approval for diagnosis and repairs before work is performed. We did not install the battery that failed originally. However, we honored the NAPA warranty and replaced it free of charge.  If we had installed it originally we would have covered parts and labor. In this case there was a small labor charge to install the battery.'}< /response>< Gmap_id>

<review>Before you read my review If you need a smog don't go here. Star Station Smog Check is right down the street and they are nicer and cheaper! (plus they do free re-checks if you fail)

I am surprised that I have to write this review because of all the positive comments I see here on yelp, but today I did not have an experience like the others.

I came in for a smog check on my newly purchased 88 Vanagon and made sure to have all mechanical conditions checked out prior to ensure a proper passing test. After leaving them the car for 4 hours I received a call that the car passed the whole test but one evap item and that they could diagnose the problem for $118 and then find out how much it would be to fix. Before accepting the charge I decided to do some researching.

After goggling around I found that this portion of the test should not be performed because there is no accurate way of performing it (almost all fail on my type of van, due to inaccuracy because they have to fully pinch a hard plastic hose, which as we know you cannot fully seal a hard plastic object by pinching it) and that my car is fully acceptable to have "not applicable" in that section and "the state" does not have problem with it. Just to be sure I called around to 3 other smog stations in the area (obviously you can't believe everything you read on the internet) and they all informed me that the statement I read was true and they do not perform the test on that part due to the inaccuracies (this was not just to get me in there, I did go and "pass" right after my "fail" with Aero Auto Repair). This in combination with another bad experience I had (brought another car there to get smogged after a repair and it failed because the battery was disconnected the day before, if I would have known I would have waited, as to not pay another full price smog just to have me do nothing but drive it around for a week before I brought it in) made me feel like I was getting cheated, so I said that I don't believe the service that they were providing was fair and that I will have to report it to my credit card and they can decide if this sounds legitimate.

The gentleman behind the counter (David) told me that he has my car and I cannot get it back now until I pay cash, that he has the power to not accept my credit card and that the only way I can get my car back is to pay cash (pretty shady if you cannot backup your claims to a credit dispute and demand cash in my opinion). Well I haven't carried around cash with me for the last 10 years, so on top of the entire bad experience he wanted me to go walking around (he has my car) to go find an ATM down the street (Very poor customer service if you ask me). After 15 minutes of back and forth he finally accepted to take my credit card and I left not a very happy customer.

I drove right down the street to Star Station Smog to find out that my claims were true and that I passed the smog test in 15 minutes!! and it was cheaper. Star Station Smog also told me that if I would have failed they would perform re-tests for FREE! (Aero Auto didn't even want to give me a discount for smog re-test that failed because the battery was disconnected).

In the end it wasn't so much of the pass/fail that was so disappointing but just the lack of customer service (but the $80 failed test that didn't have to fail does sting). There are ways you can offer assistance to help build a good customer/shop relationship and I didn't see any from my experience today.

If you need a smog, take my advice and go down the street to Star Station Smog you won't be disappointed (and no I do not work for them, but just had an amazing experience with how courteous and professional they are) .</review>< Resp>

We took it to Aero and had a diagnosis in less than two hours; we were told that the trans-axle drive shaft had a failing U-joint.  I had known about this before but didn't realize the severity of the issue, not to mention the part was expensive, so I was putting it off.  In spite of this fact, these guys helped me out by financing the cost.  Not to mention they did an excellent job; gave me a thorough diagnostic of other issues to address later; and had it installed the morning they received the part!  The new drive shaft fixed the main issue as well as a secondary symptom of vibrations at speeds above 80MPH, which I was attributing to a wheel bearing.  Since they had to order the part, Aero set us up with a rental for a mere $26 a day with Enterprise.  Excellent service and professionalism from start to finish.  Highly recommend!<//Review>< pictures>

Had my Aztek in there twice for check engine light on.  Paid hundreds to have it diagnosed and fixed twice and light came right back on.  This after they assured me they knew exactly what the problem was.  Ended up selling the car a year later with the CEL still on.< /Text>

<Review>I've been dying my own hair for about 8 years using box dyes and all that fun stuff. I finally decided it was time I tried getting it done professionally. Sam was awesome, smart and lovely to talk to while doing the process, taking time to explain what she was doing as she went which I loved. She managed to lift my natural dark brown with a bit of old red in it and dyed it an rad teal. I'll be coming back regularly to have Sam touch it up for me!< /Review>< Pics>

< Review>
TERRIBLE FRONT DESK CUSTOMER SERVICE!

Today was my first time at Onyx with Armando as my stylist. He was great! Gave me exactly what I wanted with a friendly warm demeanor.

However, at my arrival today (7/16/20 345pm) the front desk woman was too busy texting on her cell phone to realize I was there. I had to shout “hello!” multiple times to get her attention. She was unfriendly and seemed bothered to be interrupted when she checked me in. When I was ready to pay, she was talking on her personal cell phone, didn’t acknowledge me,  kept me waiting for a minute or two, and was so unfriendly when she actually rang me up. Roll back the tapes Onyx- you probably just lost a potential returning customer.< /Review>

I was able to get in and have a hair appointment with very little notice after I missed my hometown stylist.  I had the good fortune to work with Armando.  He was very professional and did a fantastic job chopping off my shag and leaving me looking sharp and crisp.  I will definitely be back.  Great price and exceptional service, esp in the Peninsula market. Thanks Armando!</review>

A friendly salon! I had the good fortune to  schedule a cut, highlight and color with Bella.  I have a head full of hair and very particular - I could not be happier with the cut and color!  I would recommend Onyx and Bella!</Review>

She makes notes of all the things I love so I leave happy anytime.  The one thing that's not as great is she's gotten so popular.  Gone are the days that I can make an appointment the day before.  I really have to do it days ahead now.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None</resp><gmapID>0x808f9df1f104a377:0x9567fc98654b686f</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

I went in with long hair and came out with a short bob because my hair was over-processed and completely damaged.  The staff is nice but based on my experience the hairdressers are not experienced enough to do the job that they charge for/ say they can do. My hair now looks highly electrified.</Review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

<review>I just started going to Onyx a few months ago and I could not be happier.  The salon is beautiful, well kept and spotless clean.  I have been going to Brook for years and I just can't say enough good things about her and her ability to cut and color my hair.</review></record>

<rate>1<//rate><review>I requested that my hair be evened up to match my current side part and the layers be clean and not done by cutting into the hair. (This is where they take the scissors and point them into the hair).  Well, Shawn used hard lines, but then pulled my hair up on top and cut straight across. This has now caused the hair on my right to be MUCH shorter than before and not even with the left.  EXACTLY what I didn't want.  I requested she start with the shortest length on the right and just go around the head on the bottom to even the rest of the hair.  This was not done.  Additionally, if you visit this stylist, you will be asked everything about your life except your blood type.</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None< /resp><gmap_id>0x808f9df1f104a377:0x9567fc98654b686f<//gmap_id></record>

<text>I went into Onyx on suggestion from a friend that has been going there for awhile, they always raved about how their hair color always turned out great and looked extremely natural. So I decided to try it out... I hate my hair color now.  I told my colorist that I wanted my hair to be a pretty chocolately brown with golden undertones WITH ABSOLUTELY NO RED! When I finished with my appointment, my hair was expresso dark brown with serious red coloring.  I didn't even look like myself, and not in a good way.
My colorist was super nice but did not listen and now I have to go get my hair fixed, at another salon.</text>< pictures>

If I could give zero stars I would. I am so very disappointed in this establishment. Truly, I would never take my pet here again, one because they never even acknowledged me when I walked in (even though I had spoken with Britney days prior to our appointment and they knew I was bringing my animal in) and two because it was really gross in there. I felt like I was in the Texas chainsaw massacre when I walked in. Really dirty and I think there was pee on the counter. I waited for a good 10 minutes and no one ever came to welcome me in or acknowledge my pet and I were even there! The worst part was that a lady (shorter with dark hair and olive skin) walked right by me and went outside to talk to what appeared to be two extremely sketchy men in the car out front (my husband was waiting for me in the car so he saw everything go down) at that point I was so fed up with the type of “service” I was getting (if you even wanna call it that!”) I walked out and I was so upset. I work in customer service and if I was to ever treat anyone the way they did I would be out of a job, period. I called right after and let them know what had happened because I was so mad. I usually let things go like this unless I have a really bad experience (hence the review). Britney my original groomer called me back later that day apologizing for the experience ( I do appreciate that) she mentioned she would call me later so she could make it up to me. Never got a text or call until the next day around 7pm? Look, I get that people have lives but when you promise a new customer that you’re gonna call them that day to make up for a bad experience PLEASE DO WHAT YOU SAY.  I ended up grooming my own animal at that point because I never got a call back!!!! I will never ever ever ever come back, recommend or have anything to do with this place ever again!!!!! I would highly suggest anyone looking for a groomer to go elsewhere. You will be disappointed and get nothing but excuses in return. Very disappointed.< /Text>

I asked for a simple grooming (brushing and some minor cutting from the fur on my dogs haunches due to matting). She is a German Shephard mix with an extremely sensitive undercoat, much like huskies and Alaskan malamutes. Because of this I specifically requested for her NOT to be shaved. Not only did they completely ignore this request, or it was forgotten by the receptionist and not communicated to the groomer, but there was 0 care put into the shave itself, leaving her coat in this condition on the back of her legs, under her thighs, belly, and her private region. I do NOT recommend taking dogs with more sensitive grooming requirements to this business unless you don't care if their coat is destroyed. I'm sure this spot is fine for simple shaves and minor grooming, but outside of this I would air on the side of caution, and make sure you communicate adamantly what you need them to do and not do.< /Text>< gmapID>

What a great experience... this place was so awesome.  Affordable and they did great job on my dog. I have a Newfoundland .. lots of hair. My dog was a mess & stinky. Cher was great!!! She came outside to met me, went over what kind of hair cut I wanted, what I expected and killed it! So pleased I picked The Grooming Room. Thank you Cher...my dog is so happy. She has  whole new attitude, looks and smells great. Would definitely recommend this place.<//Review>

Brittany did a great job cleaning, dematting and deburring my Old English Sheepdog. Followed my instructions for finished length to a T. Got him done quickly and for a great price. Nice to have a groomer I can trust only 2 blocks away.< /Review>

Do not take your dog here if they have a difficult coat or are anxious they aren't the best at grooming. and so far were the first people to not be able to finish the job and have taken him to plenty of groomers. On top of the fact that they hurt him and didn't tell me .messed up my huskys coat pretty bad and cut his hair realllllyy uneven and didn't finish his nails at allll. Made him bleed by cutting his foot without telling me. I've had amazing experiences in the past at Petco made him look fantastic and feel fantastic . They Didn't trim anything up well and shaved his hair in the back end so it is way shorter than the front.  Very very upset and disappointed it's gonna take a long time to fix spent over a half hour brushing and shaping his hair up.once he got home. They took over 2 hours on top of that and I'm confused as to why other groomers have been able.to. bath him and trim his nails and hair and made him feel and look amazing coming out. in under 45 minutes while they took over 2 hours and did not do a single thing right besides wash him. For a quick bath they could be useful but do not take your mountain dogs into this place . They will.mess up their hair.< /text>

<text>We were really excited to try this place out. Ended up very dissatisfied with multiple aspects of our visit.

1. When dropping our dog off I was giving our groomer, Brittany i believe, a run dog on our dog due to him recently having some health issues we wanted her to be aware and careful of. Brittany seemed very annoyed and was even giggling that I was doing this. I thought it was a fair thing to do given this was a new place to us.

2. Brittany called my mother in law approximately an hour after our dog was dropped off. Keep in mind he is under 2 and still gets very excited when he opens up and almost shows off. If she would have listened at drop off she would have known this. Anyways, she tells my mother in law that our pup is "just too much for her" and that he "won't settle down." Well duh lady, this is a new place for him. She then goes on to explain that she has such severe carpletunnel in her hands that she was able to bathe him but after he was bathed her hands started hurting and she would not be able to groom him. Very annoyed, my mother in law agreed to find someone to pick him up as soon as she could arrange.

3. Around another hour to 2 later we received another call stating that our dog had "finally calmed down enough" and that she was actually able to groom him just "not as well as she usually would" . Our poor pup had already missed being groomed and was so hot from all his fur we didn't even care.

4. When my brother in law was able to get there to pick up our "trouble maker" 30 pound cocker spaniel, he was very dissatisfied with how the dogs were handled. He said there were multiple dogs just wondering around together and the groomer would cut some hair on one dog, go to another, and almost make a loop of cutting instead of just doing one at a time. All possible factors as to why our dog was so hard.

We have used multiple places to try to find the right groomer for us. We had really high hopes this could be our permanent groomer, but unfortunately we will not be returning. Also hoping our dog didn't get any other pups pregnant while he was there roaming 🤣 sometimes cheaper and faster to get in isn't always better. And that is a lesson learned on our part.< /text>< user_id>

We have been taking our dogs to the Grooming Room for over 15 years and after that many years we should know they do a great job! Brittney is our Go-to-Girl and has perfectly groomed our multiple breeds of dogs for years. Very resonably priced and clean enough, it's pet grooming and the dogs like going! Side point, Missy Wadell's review has nothing to do with the business and should be appropriately removed, just saying. We'll continue to readily refer business. Thank You Again Grooming Room!<//review>

My three dogs love the Grooming Room ladies!!! Because they are gentle and sensitive to their individual needs.  Lizzie is a Conton De Tulear with the most difficult coat, just like a big cotton ball, and the ladies at the Grooming Room always having her looking like a show dog when I pick her up.  My dogs always smell so good and are so hug-able and cuggle-able.  thank you again Ladies!!!< /review>

When I got my Bichon, he was a mess and looked like he had not been groomed for a year. A friend referred me to The Grooming Room. Judy took excellent care of him. He looked amazing. I could tell that she really cared about my Emerson. That was seven years ago. I have referred many people to The Grooming Room because I am never disappointed and I want my friends to have the same experience. Thank you, Judy and Christie. You are great!<//text>

Having tried some other places, I am so happy to have come to The Grooming Room.
I have been a client for more than three years.  Brittney has always done my dog and she does exactly as I ask of her.  Also, my dog loves her.</text>

I’m a rideshare driver, I picked up one of your groomers to take her to work here. Skinnyish, green tie dyed shirt, red hair... weathered...

She texted me to tell me where she was and what she was wearing THRU the app. I took her 18 miles to the middle of nowhere where it cost me more money to get back to civilization, but hey that’s my job and I did my job. We had a nice conversation and I even asked her if I could bring my dog in for a groom as I’m new to the area. Was fully planning on making the trip from sac to auburn to bring my business to her.

So a month later I’m missing 15 bucks from my earnings and I call  to find out what the issue is? Well, this particular employee of yours decided to call and tell them I picked up the wrong person! The wrong person who texted me to tell me what she was wearing and where she was standing precisely and could confirm her name and destination all thru the app she ordered the ride from to work from and this “wrong person” happened to be going to work at the very same destination as she was. What a crazy coincidence!!!!! So the rideshare company decided to trust her and take money from my earnings that I had to spend 3 hours of my life fighting for it back.

I’m not in the business of giving charity rides away to broke dishonest people. I hope you realize that when you call and lie and say your driver picked up the wrong person, that goes against us. We are automatically docked our pay and our rating goes down. I told you all about how I lost my home to a fire and just
Moved here and had no one, and I was struggling to make ends meat and you decided it was cool to lie and take money from my pocket?

I doubt anyone comes into your job and lies about you and your employer takes money from your check without asking. What you did to me wasn’t right and you should feel absolutely ashamed.

Whoever decides to do business here should know how absolutely crooked SOME of the employees are. If you’re going to mess with my business, be prepared to have it come back on you.

I’m sorry you’re hurting that badly for 14 or 15 bucks, but stealing it from me shouldn’t have been your only option. Disgraceful. I will NOT be bringing my animals here and I will NOT be leaving a positive review for crooks.< /review>

My old, grouchy, fearful lily was given a shave, a bath and a nail trim when Petco made up
Excuse after excuse not to groom her. After we’d been going there for years. I’m so tired of timid, inexperienced groomers that don’t know dogs or how to care for rescues and older pets. My girl and I left the Grooming Room feeling so relieved and happy. Thanks a million!</text>

They do not returns  calls. Too causal opened door and couple laying on couch together. My dog was injured there, brushed too hard and had a scab by the time I noticed. But... I do take my pets there because I was able to complain about the injury to my dogs neck, and it has never happened again. I have a dog who worries me because she is dominating but they handle her attitude well.< /Review>

They squeezed in my MIL 2 dogs last minute. Not to mention we were 1et time clients. Also, the 2 dogs had become too much for elderly mil to handle and brittanie wad able to rehome the dog for us. They really do love animals. So glad i found them</Text>

The customer service was horrible. When I asked for no cheese, she said, "So you want me to take it off?" I said yes please, she ignored me and sighed, an irritated, one, too. I got home and the sandwiches were warm, they're supposed to be cold, but the turkey inside was warm, it's supposed to be cold. Anyway, I'm not giving the person's name, for security reasons, but other than that, most of the time the customer service is good.<//Text>

It’s either they have decent customer service or none at all. I’ve been there before and had terrible service and gone again and have decent service. I asked for a salad and the lady said they don’t chop anymore. I’ve gone to other subways and just felt like she was being lazy af.< /text>

I am not one to complain but I did not like the customer service at this location.
The employ who took my order last night did not even greet with me a smile nor a “hello”
Right of the bat she had a B!%<# face.
I honestly should of walked out that subway and never return.
They were out of honey oat bread and chocolate chips cookies  (this was about 6 pm.)
Same b!%<# face employ rang me and didn’t bother to say “thank you” or have a “ have a good day “
I’m sorry but what kind of customer service is this ?</Text>

Very yummy home-style sandwiches. They have slips that you fill out to design your own sandwich. They don't have combos but you can buy a drink and some chips on the side.if you chose.< /text>

<review>This location is easy fast and clean it's in a outdoor center,  depending on the staff that you get sometimes they're nice and sometimes they're not but for the most part they're very efficient they make your sandwich the way you want it and that's one of the things that I care about the most the way they make my sandwich that makes me happy.<//review>< Pictures>

2nd Time I Come Here And It Seems To Be Going From Bad To Worse 😒😒..Walked In None Of The 6+ Employees Welcome Us Like Other Subways..As We're Ordering I Mentioned I Wanted Light Mustard, Jalapeños And Banana Peppers And Seems She Didn't Care And She Put A Lot Of Chiles And Mustard It Wasn't Edible Same Thing Happened To My Husband's Sandwich So We Basically Paid Over $20 To Take 1 Bite And Get Grossed Out And Have To Toss It.. Never  Again, I'm Sticking To The One On Slauson Ave Where They Are 100% More Attentive..<//text>

<text>I’ve lived in several communities and this is one of the worst garbage collection companies I’ve dealt with. They often miss the scheduled pick ups. Their phones are constantly down, and if they do answer, the individuals who are in customer service roles are often in a bad mood. Their fees were arbitrarily increased with no input from the community. This company has a complete monopoly and our community deserves better<//text><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

Minus 5 stars!!  This is the worst garbage company ever!  With the price they charge, they should be able to hire someone to answer the darn phone.  They are so inconsistent with garbage pick-up. This is ridiculous.<//text>

The month they started serving our area they asked us to send in info for the CARE program.  I got 1 month discount and then it disappeared. I was on auto pay and didn't receive any bills.  Later that year I noticed the higher charges.  I called the office and they said send in the paperwork again.  So I did and then I recived an email that said they no longer offer that.  A few months later on their website to see how I could lower my bill I see they in fact do have it. Called again. Sent in paperwork again,, this time they gave me a credit for the past year. So I emailed and say wait what about the 2 years before that, were is that credit.  They claim I just signed up for it in dec 2020. Every bill is higher and higher.  There has to be a better option.<//Review>

Recology needs to put the customer back in customer service. I pay my bills on time and the very least I expect is for the cans I pay for to be picked up and emptied. No more, no less. When they aren’t and I call, am on hold for over an hour....told my cans will be picked up and emptied before the regular pick up day, so I can refill them and then no one shows up? Really? Why lie and tell me they’ll be picked up? If there is another garbage company in Sonoma county? I’m looking for it.<//Text>

We started new service. They made us wait 2 weeks to get cans which is a negative but explained they were behind due to Covid which makes sense. They were otherwise extremely customer service oriented and pleasant to work with</Text>

Truthfully, I've seen a can or two missed.  But otherwise they have been reliable.  I've not seen any spilled trash.
Remarkably, a request for an extra can to help me with an extra need has always been honored.  I find this a great service.  Phone service and requests have always been rapid.<//Text>

<review>I have NEVER received a bill from them, I have called and asked them for a bill, I was told that they mailed it out. I never received it, so I called again. I was told that maybe someone is stealing it out of my mail box. (Kinda funny I get all of my other bills and mail, but ok.) I opened a P.O. Box so there would be NO DOUBT that someone was stealing my garbage bill. They said they would send me out a bill when I changed the address. Well I still have yet to receive it. I called this morning and spoke with Monica who was extremely rude. She said I should've received a 60 day notice. I told her I have never even received a bill, or a 60 day notice. She said yes I had. This company is a joke! They have NEVER sent me a thing.<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

<text>Just wanted to add to the masses of upset customers with this company. I kinda can't believe they have lasted this long with such terrible customer service. This is not a difficult business to run, but they sure make it seem that way. I asked a question, the lady was rude as heck on the phone, then I asked a follow up question and she was even more rude. It's really unbelievable. They also tried to double charge me for my normal trash pick up, I had to email the invoice in and ask what was happening. Just a horrifying experience with this company. My goodness.<//text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

Zero stars, if I could give it. I have NEVER had such issues with "customer service" on the phone before. It's unbelievable. I had to call a couple of times to research info about and then to order a bin rental--no big deal. (Had to call because their website does not work at all on mobile, which seems crazy in this day and age. They need a serious IT upgrade!)  But my experience has been awful. I was on hold no less than 15 minutes EVERY time I called, and then it got worse. The people who finally answered were rude, literally ignored what I was asking and did not answer my questions, "transferred" me to a different department while I was mid-sentence and still speaking, and even hung up on me. Twice.  I'm stunned. I wasn't complaining, wasn't angry or anything, but just had a few questions about dimensions...and was treated, ironically, like trash. Honestly, I would fire every one of these "customer service" representatives. I would boycott this company if I could.</review>

The worst service in my 50+years of paying for garbage disposal!
I never know if my can will be picked up. When I call, they give me another time but it’s still arbitrary. The cans are left in the middle of the street, blocking driveways etc. If they hate their jobs so much maybe try to not take it out on the customers. The bills are too high and no other option but to pay them. The worst!< /review>

Ok, I have to admit I was as upset as everyone else with the terrible rate hike we all encountered when this new company took over and my experience early on was not wonderful either.... but with that said I just had an amazing experience with my commercial account in Santa Rosa. I had an issue that a supervisor (Joe) jumped on the next day after I called and he could not have provided better personal customer service for our account! He sent out his driver the same day (Pepe') who was also very experienced and provided outstanding customer service as well! I couldn't help but take the time out of my very busy day to write an encouragement to 2 men who take their jobs seriously and clearly have a customer service heart!!</review>

This company is a joke, they took my cans when my account was in good standing....waited two weeks to get them back....they take them back the week after.....wait another week to get them back....they then drop off another set (total of 6 cans) so now, a year later they take my cans and say I have been sent to collections...so I have had two accounts this whole time and only getting a bill for one...I have spent HOURS on the phone with this company over the past couple weeks with no end in site......GARBAGE CANS SHOULDNT BE THIS DIFFICULT</review>

I have contacted their office on several occasions regarding a truck that insists on blocking traffic on a narrow street (Maple) during the lunch hour.  If the company were to plan better, they would not need to inconvenience residents in an already congested area by adding to it during the lunch hour.  Nasty and inconsiderate.</text>

Rates keep going up without warning. I wanted to rent a debris box and the price is outrageous! On top of that the monthly street sweeping truck doesn't sweep anything. The truck stays in the middle of the street and does sweep anything at all. I have to go and do it myself with my broom and dustpan! We pay too much money for bad service.</Review>

Absolutely horrible company to do business with. The rates increased and the level of service decreased. 1hr + hold times, and long lines at the office. I never thought there could be worse places than the DMV and PG and E.<//Text>

If I could give 0 stars I would.  I don’t know why our county decided to switch to recology because it has been a mess ever since and the rates are ridiculously more expensive than the other provider who was great to work with.  Customer service is horrible and the drivers are horrible to deal with.  They will give you an overcharge slip of your lid is barely raised (which I didn’t know until I received one after a holiday when my regular pick up day was delayed).  A driver also threw something into our street (I watched him) when somebody put something non recyclable in the recycling.  I wish we had other options because I would prefer to not deal with them - we will probably start bringing our garbage to the dump ourselves just to avoid using their services< /review>

Talked to three people on the phone who obviously didn’t pass the fourth grade. Just trying to set up an online account and needed a user ID number. First got told They can’t help and was sent an email with directions that weren’t even to what I needed. Second the guy kept cutting me off and wouldn’t even let me spell my name (which he kept getting wrong) third lady I spoke to I’m sure doesn’t even work there. Zero job knowledge. Is there really an epidemic of people trying to pay other people’s garbage bill?!??</Text>

<Text>I have been avoiding saying anything negative because of wanting to give them the benefit of the doubt as they adapt to new area. But today, when they ignored our green bins for the second time, I’ve had it. Aren’t they supposed to be maximizing green-cycling? That was one of the reasons I didn’t complain sooner about them not replacing the prior service’s bins. Now, having not switched them, they ignore them. I personally went through the waste inside and removed items that didn’t belong. When I encountered the driver outside this morning, I tried to ask what’s up. He signaled that he was on the phone. Then took off. Unacceptable. Higher prices, lighter-weight bins, terrible service, unanswered phones.<//Text>< Pics>

< Review>
This place is some kind of joke. I am actually furious right now. You call and call and call but they never answer. You go in, they always make you wait even if they're not busy. Their drivers are so lazy. They won't pick up my compost because it's overloaded supposedly whereas everyone else on the street is also yet their cans get picked up. But they didn't even bother to tell me they weren't going to pick it up until a full week later so this compost sat on the curb for two weeks before they even bothered to leave a notice that they weren't going to pick it up. This is not the first time that they haven't picked up my compost either, by the way, and it was not overloaded the first time. There was actually nothing wrong with it the first time at all. And yet I still had to go and waste my time to ask these people why my garbage wasn't picked up. I have to come waste my time because nobody wants to do their job right the first time. If you are not going to pick it up because it's unsafe or you're lazy or whatever you claim is the reason you're not picking it up, then you should have told me that the first week the garbage sat on the curb, not the second. Meanwhile, I'm now over a week behind on the yard work I need done by the time fire season comes back around. Rude, lazy, terrible customer service. Wish I had more options than just dealing with these people or taking my own trash to the dump! These drivers make loads of money for basically doing nothing. How do I get this job?</Review>

Today I will have to call Recology Sonoma Marin, for the 5th time, for our recycling not being picked up. Very disappointing. I will be expecting a credit on my next bill since 5 missed garbage days is 1 month 1 week of service that we have paid for, but not been serviced.<//text>

<Review>Absolutely HORRIBLE company to deal with. Very poor communication with billing, and they switched websites and billing periods. They don't post a due date on their statements and tell you via recording, as you wait on hold for 30 to 45minutes to pay it before the 15th of the following month or pay a late fee. I had auto pay set up so I didn't pay attention to the mail and once, and only ONCE did they communicate that there was a new website. So when I logged into the old website it says "Recology" and balance $0.
And I cant get a knowledgeable person on the phone to even help.

<Review>trying to set up an automatic payment system is a bit more difficult than learning the Cyrillic.alphabet. There is NO WAY to look at one's bill unless/until you set up account and yet they have retained my old account sign in from Ratto. Setting up such account becomes ridiculous--password with numbers, LC, UC and only limited characters. Miserable system. Trying to change the credit card I use cancelled out everything I had just set up. I still have not been able to view my bill so have no idea the period of time it covers.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

These people do a poor job pretending to be in the disposal business.  They charge incredibly high prices for lousy service.  If you put something out for recycle they don't pick it up but leave a flyer with detailed instructions on how they want everything wrapped, tied and bundled.  We are talking recycle here.  Several times they have selectively taken half my trash and left the rest.  This not only happens to me buy to my neighbor.  This is about the 3rd trash company in as many years.  Every year the name changes and the price for pick up goes up 25%.  West County needs a real disposal company that cares about proving the residence with good service.  If you read any positive comments on this site its because RED probably wrote it.  These people are a painful joke.<//Review>

The commercial properties that we have this company service for refuse has failed time and time again to communicate when they are unable to empty our dumpsters. Our company goes above and beyond to make sure we comply with waste disposal standards, but when anonymous persons are constantly contaminating our dumpsters, it would be nice if we could get a call, note, or photo (it is the 21st century, after all) as other waste management companies do so we are aware of any noncompliances going on as opposed to allowing garbage to pile up without any explanation. The phone operators are always friendly and do their best to be helpful, but they are never aware of the goings on. The communication in  the company needs to needs to improve.<//Text>

They took my old trash cans but didn’t replace all of them. It took 4 calls and about a month to finally get them delivered and I only live a mile away from their place. Overpriced. Cans somehow end up 15yds from where I put them every time. The last 3 times I put out the compost can they never emptied it. Way more expensive and crappier service compared to the previous company.<//text>

This company dropped off cans, on their own and without my request, at my house that was totally destroyed by the fire.  Nothing was left but bare land for 2 or 3 blocks in every direction. How dump (dumb) can they get.
I had left Santa Rosa after the fire, when I came back I found out that I have been charged a monthly fee.  They provide no service on my street, yet I get the bill every month.</review>

<text>Pick up service is fine, it's the billing that is constantly a challenge.  Their website for payment is so confusing and unfriendly, unclear. They said my CC declined when I just put in an updated one the month before. NO contact info on it either, so had to google them to call my CC in and have now gone back to the old-fashion bill by mail. Ridiculous. No I'm sorry about that either when I complained on the phone. So customer service is so so.<//text>< Resp>

Very rude customer service! Folks on the phone have no skills AT ALL. New cans were dropped off in front of the house and not where the old cans were waiting to be picked up on the sideyard street (i live on a corner). When I called asked the young woman at the service desk why they left the new cans in the wrong place and didn't pick up my old cans h, she told me I could just " take them in and bring them out again next week" No apology, no good manners no basic customer service skills. Then she hung up on me<//review>

<Review>This company is absolutely horrible. They never empty the garbage cans like they're supposed to, and they refuse to give you a refund for substandard service. Every week they somehow manage to empty half of the garbage can, so that we only have use of half of it for the following week. We keep calling and calling and they just refuse to do anything to improve their "service". They promise to come out and empty it but they never do. Absolutely worthless.
P.S I had to give them one star to be able to post this, but I would've liked to give them negative stars if I could've.< /Review><pics>None< /pics><response>None< /response><Gmap_id>0x808436295eeaaac9:0xb4d177a97363f530< /Gmap_id></record>

Really awful company! Several times they have not picked up my recycle container. They pick up the compost and trash, but ignore the recycle. They pick up my neighbors' recycle containers, but not mine. When I try to call, they don't answer the phone. I tried to log into my account, but it won't accept my credentials. When I tried to change my password, that is not allowed. Somebody called them a "joke." No, jokes are funny. This company is just plain awful. I got service from the previous waste collection company. Whoever picked Recology to provide service should be fired! Better yet, they should have Recology as their waste collection company.</Review>

Wish there was a zero star option - trash didn't get picked up. Can not get anyone to answer the phone - did the press 6 thing - no call back, waited on hold for 45 minutes twice with no answer- sent e-mails "for faster service" like they suggested while on terminal hold - no response to those either.  And they raised our rates??</Text>

<Review>The bottom of the bottom. Liars. They miss collections, I call, they say they'll collect, and don't. The Ratto Company was so much better. These guys are cons. But they don't care, they don't have to--they're the rubbish company!</Review></record>

this review is prompted due to seeing a recology truck driving down the highway with garbage flying out of it.  I dont think I have ever seen so much fly out of a garbage truck.  I can't say I understand why I needed new garbage cans, my old cans were great, they're garbage cans.lol.  seems like a waste to replace something that ain't broke.   i also dont understand why I'm paying twice as much for garbage hauling.   the old company Ratto was fine, they always answered when I called, but then I really didnt call them much, which in my book if you dont have call all the time, the company is doing a good job.</text>

<text>Thank you Driver. I live on Peterson lane and for got to take my trash out. I heard the truck so a rushed out with baby in my arm and dragged the can out. Well the driver must of saw me and had already serviced our side of the street. I heard the truck back up and he got out and moved my trash can so he could empty it. Thank you Driver! I appreciate you took the time to do that when you didn't have to.</text>< Pictures>

This company is so screwed up it would fail if it weren't for socialistic pricing and monopolistic territories.  I called them several times and having to wait 20 - 30 minutes each time is NOT reasonable.  The last time I called, the lady said they had 50 people answering the phone.  I doubt that, but they certainly need more.  the problem is I have to contact them because they make so many errors on my bill.  The lady said she would look into my situation and call me back.  Surprise, no call back.  I'm on hold again as I write this review.  If I had another choice I would go with another company.</Review>

Horrible Company. Billing is a mess. They fail to come and pick up the trash at our commercial buildings on a regular basis. When I call to have them come do their job, they say they will "add a note to the account". Now they are raising their rates for horrible service. They have never offered to refund for the service they didn't provide.< /review>

Absolutely awful. How could santa rosa make such a stupid decision? Ratto wasn't that bad, the prices were good....maybe they needed some help from the city/county to comply with harder standards...but youre telling me that running them out of town was the best decision? They not only raised their prices dramatically but no longer offer the free bin once per year??? This is terrible for us as a community, feels like we have been railroaded...I'm very unhappy with this.</Text>

Sitting here at 4:20pm with no garbage/recycling pick up yet and tomorrow is the 4th of July. My husband called and they said they just haven't been down our side of the street yet. Kind of funny when the neighbors across the street have had their garbage and green waste picked up and our street has no outlet so there's no way they could have not passed our house on the way out. Not a happy camper right now. We have company for the 4th and it needs to be picked up today, not when they get around to it.< /review>

The poor reviews add up. This business has little regard for customer relations/service. A routine call to inquire about a missed pick-up was responded to with rudeness, including by a manager. They tell a customer that it is too bad that your garbage was not picked up - you missed the 24 hour window to notify us. They add that they have no likekind requirement to notify a customer if they miss a collection due to weather, etc. Unpleasant!!!<//text>

<text>I've never written a negative review about any company, however Redwood Empire Disposal Company is awful. I manage a larger commercial site with specific garbage needs and they cannot get a single one right. They make mistake after mistake after mistake and have terrible customer service. I have to call them on a weekly basis because of errors they've made, their hold time is outrageous and they literally never get it right. If you can avoid using this company, DO IT!</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< userid>

<Review>Our garbage and recycling cans weren't picked up on our regular day, so I called Redwood Disposal.  It is impossible to reach anyone near Santa Rosa where our local  company is based.  Instead I was routed after a long wait to a call center in Arizona.  The result of the first call I made this morning was that our garbage would be picked up next week at the regular time -- not helpful with already full cans!  The result of the second call was that my call had been "escalated" to a manager and I would get a call back very soon.  45 minutes later that hasn't happened.  Just want the garbage picked up along with the neighbors on our side of the street, and others along 3 to 4 other streets whose cans remain full.  Weak, weak, weak service -- what an unwelcome world of corporate protocols,  anonymity and "efficiency."< /Review>< Pictures>

Update:
Hmmm, new year, new rate increase.. still, questionable service, at least my trash cart no longer lay on the street when I get home.

___
What else can I say?  Very poor customer service!!!  I'm not going to elaborate on it here.  IT'S 'trash' we are talking about here, can't the city/county council members make things easier instead of making them more complicated?!  Bad idea to award the contract to this company with our tax dollars!

btw, my review had nothing to do with the nearly 100% rate increase on my part so Recology can buy 50 new trucks and 10k+ carts.< /Text>

Redwood Empire (The Ratto Group) is a greedy company that makes you pay 3 months in advance and if you need service or to replace a can they broke and you have not paid for 3 months of service in ADVANCE they will tell you your account is delinquent and ignore you.  They also hang up on you if you tell them this.  We need to get rid of this greedy company in Sonoma County!!
Also, the real reviews here are all one star the others were probably written by the Ratto group to improve the rating</Text>

So I get home and see my trash can is right in the middle of my driveway. Already irritated from my cans not being picked up the day before, I look at my camera facing the street on my house and low and behold, the guy picking up my cans moves the last can purposely to the middle of my driveway with a note saying my cans were not out properly yesterday...um, yes they were, but clearly I can see your customer service. Wish I could upload a picture.</Text>

Redwood Empire Disposal street sweeping truck just did my street. What a big mess they made. So, we the people who live on the street have to sweep all the rocks off the road.  I would never have Redwood Empire Disposal do street sweeping if it was my choice. Maybe someone was paid off at city hall in Santa Rosa to get the sweeping contract.1-5-2015<//Text>

<review>We ate here recently while visiting SD as it was close to our hotel on a rainy cold night. What a lovely experience--very romantic! The restaurant is absolutely beautiful, and our meal was so delicious! We shared a scrumptious salad and the lasagna was surely the best we have ever tasted. There are many restaurants in SD, but we will definitely have to return here on our next visit! for dessert, I got some kind of cherry cheesecake and it was to die for. I can't remember what my friend got for dessert because I was so enraptured by mine!<//review>< Response>

Rating is mainly for food - I thought it was ok. Its also possible that my bar for Italian food is higher having been to Italy recently. Service was very good.<//review>

They are doing delivery and pickup during COVID and they have some great specials if you check out their social media and website. Was able to get a great deal on a bottle of wine too. The veal is amazing and their desserts are to die for. Highly recommend this place, been around for 30 plus years and they have it down. Support local.< /Review>< pics>

<text>Wonderful experience. We had a four course dinner and dessert that was fabulous. The antipasto was yummy. The eggplant creamy soup was delicious. The steak was tender and cooked perfectly. The selection of 3 pastas was delicious. The creme brulee was superb. Also, the wine was delicious. Overall, a fantastic experience with family and the bridal couple.<//text><Pics>None</Pics>< Date>

For someone like myself who had been in Italy, I can vouch and say this restaurant makes you feel like you are having dinner in Italy. The atmosphere and the music from the harp made our night so delightful. I also want to say that the customer service was so great, and our server Rachel was super great in informing us about the menu options, she for sure knows the meaning of customer service. If you want a great romantic dinner come to Salvatore's Cucina Italiana.</review>< Pics>

This place is fantastic. Everyone meal was so good. The food is rich and hearty. The bread was very good. The service was very good. You are surrounded by white and light grey painted opulence and decor for for a wedding. Just plane delicious. The praline cheesecake was bland and the single thing that wasn't fabulous. If you line Italian, you will love this place.</text>

< Review>
Salvatore’s is my favorite Italian spot in San Diego. I’ve lived in downtown San Diego for three years and they are hands down the best Italian spot. Everything is made from scratch and personalize from the sweet little Italian lady (she’s been there for 20 some years).  The happy the hour is legit too. Check out the shrimp scampi. Thank me later</Review>

Staff was polite, attentive, and patient. I had the scampi and my date had the lasagna...both were amazing!

Very romantic and contemporary setting. Relaxing music with dim, ambient lighting. Extremely affordable for the quality of experience.

My number one date spot!!!< /review>

One of the moths eventually ended up in one of our plates, so we couldn’t eat majority of it. Maybe they should start actually caring about the hygiene and deal with the bugs instead of letting them stay and having the customers deal with them. Kind of really annoyed. Food was also very mediocre, definitely not worth the price.</review>< pics>

It was such an amazing experience! The atmosphere was incredible, and the food was great, and the manager, David, went above and beyond to make our night memorable. My husband and I went there for our anniversary. I didn't bring my phone, and my husbands phone had died, so we weren't going to be able to get a picture of our special day. He stopped what he was doing, took our picture, and made sure to send it to us right then. It just showed how much he cares about his customers, not just their business.<//Review>

<text>Easily the worst service ever experienced in any restaurant downtown from start to finish! Staff completely out of sorts how to service a party of 12 leaving us unintended & waiting between any table server's appearance. Food had obviously sat long prior to finally being served & was barely adequate! Shrimp in my meal was tough & beyond over cooked! Nothing fine bout the experience!</text><user_id>105281216756727901456<//user_id><rate>1<//rate><Pics>None<//Pics><Date>1538496485205<//Date><GmapID>0x80d9535634fcbfe9:0xfe68ef4be94ab960<//GmapID><user_name>Gail Hillen<//user_name><resp>None<//resp></record></dataset><record>

We regularly stop at Salvatore's Cucina Italiana store and deli on our way back to Oregon.  We love the deli!  We visited the restaurant for breakfast on our last trip. The omelet was just 'meh', but the servers were friendly.  We'll definitely stop at the deli, but probably not the restaurant.<//Text>

Group of 3.  Every meal was excellent.  Service was attentive but not intrusive.  The Scampi divine, all pasta fabulous, soups and salads excellent.  Cocktails - ask for a Rye Old Fashioned- yummy.  Wine list by the glass very good; by the bottle even more extensive.  Good stuff!  Just go!<//text>

I had an amazing 21st birthday experience at Salvatore's Cucina Italiana! The staff were very welcoming and friendly, and made my birthday very special. The harpist surprised me with the birthday tune and the waiter surprised me with a very delicious slice of cake. The food was incredible, for a very reasonable price, and my whole party enjoyed it. I shall definitely recommend this place to my friends in San Diego!< /review>

<Text>Elegant, romantic, yet unstuffy ambiance. We were warmly greeted upon entry. Service was spot on, attentive but not overbearing in the least. The server was knowledgeable about the menu and the history of the restaurant, and was more than accomodating when my husband ordered a traditional Italian dish off menu. The food was impressive, great flavor. I wished I had ordered a full portion of my pasta. Homemade ricotta was a delightful finish. Great find!< /Text>< pics>

basic. there was absolutely nothing special about the food, the drinks or the experience. not sure what the hype is about this restaurant. had meals that were 10x better at Cucina Urbana and other local places.</text>

<Review>Great service at this place; although the decor was a bit outdated and garrish . . . . although, perhaps to some that is part of the charm.  The food overall was pretty good; however, the wait staff really pushed the "classic"/"favorite" dish, which was was good, but not worthy of all of the praise heaped upon it . . . . nor the cost.  Some of the other entrees served at our table of 10 were much better (I did sample a few); although the prices were a bit high for what you got.< /Review><user_id>102260255433908660445< /user_id>< name>

<Review>Best italian food I have had in San Diego! It's a very nice atmosphere and great classic italian dishes. The osso bucco is ridiculously good, I have also had the lasagna and it is incredible. Great staff that are very attentive and helpful!

I love this place, and highly recommend it!< /Review>< pictures>

<Text>I rang up at 10 am and had a locker signed and sealed by about 10.15 . I was referred by my son who researched all of the options and Security Public Storage had a great reputation for being pest free and very secure . Because my son referred me I even got a discount.

I love this place! I have a number of clients that trust them too! It's clean, safe & Steve will always go that extra mile in order to get my sometime, unique needs, met. I really appreciate that & it keeps me coming here.... Just want to update my last review. Once again, Steve & Security Public Storage have made things work for me. With as little as 2 weeks notice, they managed to get me 2 more units! Love this place! That's why I keep coming back....<//text>

I have used this facility for almost 5 years. The staff is courteous, the buildings clean. I appreciate that there are carts to help take boxes to my unit. The automatic billing makes it easy.

I've used a lot of storage facilities over the years and Security Public Storage in Redwood City is definitely worthy of a 5 star rating.
Of primary importance my items have been safe and secure in a clean environment, and I have no worries that they will be damaged. Secondly, the manager, Steve, is customer oriented and always really helpful. I think this is pretty rare in this industry. Finally the prices are reasonable.
I highly recommend this facility for both long term and short term storage needs.< /review>

<text>I have used PSP in Redwood City for a while now and I feel it is a safe and secure facility. There is someone always on staff and the public is never left alone to roam around without the knowledge of staff and video surveillance therefore i feel my belongings are safer there than at other places.

This place seems to be different than other storage lots in that they actually have FRIENDLY and HELPFUL staff here!! It's also a very clean facility which is nice, so I don't feel like I'm taking my furniture to a dump. Plenty of parking, and location is good too. When I leave here I have a feeling that my things are safe which takes a load off of my mind.

Steve and Chris are both very helpful and nice, and very patient as well since English isn't my first language.

Anyway if you are looking for a place to store your belongings, look no further! If you don't believe me just call them up, they are very friendly guys.</review>

<Text>I have used this storage center for many years for my business.  After looking at other facilities, this one really stood out.  The manager, Steve Garnett,  takes his job seriously and it shows!  The staff is always helpful and courteous and they keep the facility clean. In addition, this is one place that puts security first.  All protocol is followed to insure safe conditions. The option of offering me automatic billing is a God sent.  Highly recommend.< /Text><Rate>5</Rate>< name>

I have stored my things at various facilities and this one is far more organized, courteous, and friendly.  Though the facility is on the aging side externally they have made improvements with the interiors that make visits here pleasant. Pricing is relatively competitive but service is above average for sure.  They are nice to deal with.< /text>

We have been using Security Public Storage for two years now.  I am so extremely happy with having our belongings stored there.  The staff is wonderful.  The premises is safe and secure.  I am always greeted with a smile and everyone is extremely helpful as well.  I lost the keys to my unit and my lock was sawed off in no time at all.

I moved here from San Diego and chose Security Public Storage Redwood City because Steve was totally knowledgeable and helpful, the location, the cleanliness and security of the building. I am staying with a relative while looking for a place to rent so all of my worldly possessions are in storage. I have peace of mind that they are in a good, safe, clean place. And if I need to go in and out of my storage unit, it's pleasant, not creepy or weird. I highly recommend Security Public Storage!<//review>

The world of storage can often seem like nothing more than a lot of boxes, but thanks to the hard work of Steve & Osagie, SPS is a great deal more than that (and compared to local competitors, a great deal, period);  Every time I've needed help or information, these gentlemen have been good solid dudes, about providing it... They'll help anyway they can, with can take a lot of stress out of dealing with all those boxes!<//text>

Clean and secure building. They have online payment available, I had some issues with it at first, but they seemed to have fixed it. Also was supposed to be signed up for automatic payments but somehow that did not happen causing some billing confusion on my end, I was finally able to do that online when making a payment recently, thankfully because I haven't been able to do it in person since I was traveling for several months out of the country with limited internet making it difficult to pay online each month, and I was really counting on automatic payments. Price has gone up since I started using them, still somewhat reasonable, but I will be moving out soon because I can no longer justify, or afford spending that money. Other than that, they are a great facility with friendly and helpful staff.<//review>

I've been using Security Public Storage for about a year now to store my things and I've not had any problems at all. It's convenient and easy to go in and get my things out when I need them, and every time I've interacted with the staff they have been attentive and helpful. A great option if you live in the area and need storage space.</Text>

Security Public Storage is safe, easy, and Steve is the man.  Call on the way and he clears the loading dock for you.  There are always carts available for moving.  The units are inside and safe. Also, automatic payments are very useful.  I highly recommend using this storage unit.</review>

<text>I have used this storage center for many years for my business.  After looking at other facilities, this one really stood out.  The manager, Steve Garnett,  takes his job seriously and it shows!  The staff is always helpful and courteous and they keep the facility clean. In addition, this is one place that puts security first.  All protocol is followed to insure safe conditions.
This is the only personalized and efficient storage center to use.  Highly recommend!</text>< Pics>

Staff is very professional and helpful. Pricing is very clear with no hidden fees. When shopping around, I chose Security Public Storage—even though they were a little bit more expensive—because they are open on weekends and I trust them not to increase my rental rate unnecessarily. I'm very happy so far.< /Text>

One of the best storage places on the Peninsula.  The management and staff keep the facility pristine and security is solid.  Their commercial size cargo ramp and dock and large open loading area is great if you have one of the larger U-Haul moving trucks.

Steve Garnett, their Manager is friendly, pro-active and as a Redwood City native, he can provide those new to the area plenty of local knowledge.< /text>

The storage units seem secure, which was my number one concern in choosing the location. I was helped by Chris, who gave me a great deal for three months. Being able to pay for the unit online is a big help since I'm currently outside of the country, and any emails I've sent to the management have been quickly been responded to, usually within the same day.< /Text><pics>None</pics>< response>

When I first discovered it I'd moved to a new neighborhood and hadn't thought ahead to how small our apartment was. I needed storage on short notice and found a place practically across the street. It was such a great experience that I realized I would've driven miles.

So today I had a load of stuff to drop off and grab the winter goods. I'd forgotten my access code again so I got to see Steve in the office who'd been so awesome before. Not only did the place smell really nice, it was clean, organized, and I was greeted by a sharp-eyed friend who recognized me immediately. He's got the greatest demeanor and made my drudgery chore totally cool.

5 Star. A+. These guys should teach a class on how to run a business.< /Review><Rate>5< /Rate></record>

< review>
I rented this space in a rush and didn't look at it ahead. The building is clean and secure, with large elevators. The office staff are nice.

But the ceilings are only 8' high and the lighting is awful. The area between lockers on each side is narrow, making it a puzzle to get larger items situated. My movers were frustrated and they're experienced.

The motion sensor lights turn off after just a few minutes and you have to go down the hall, wave your arms to turn them on. Previously, I've had drive up storage and this was never an issue. Bring a flashlight!

The building is COLD. Dress for winter. It never gets sun and the cement holds intense, bone numbing cold. It's good for my stuff, so I bring a jacket and gloves even to just run in for a couple of things. They will all be ice cold.

I'm not a fan of the limited hours. Traffic at rush hour makes it hard to get to get there during the week. The early daily close is a pain. The 9pm close at my former storage area was really handy.< /review>

I was so happy to find Security Public Storage. They are amazing in every single way:

1.Great customer service! I usually interact with Steve who is always very helpful. He always does what he can to offer you the best deals.

2. This place has the best deals! I looked around and no other self-storage place could compare.

3. They let you use a moving truck to move your stuff into storage. I saved at least $100 alone from this service.

4. Storage units are inside the building and protected from the elements, rain, etc. and are typically 20degrees lower than the weather outside.
It is even printed from rodents and pests.

5. They have security cameras, and individual alarms for each unit and have never had a breakin and have been open for 31 years.

6. It is located off El Camino, which is super convenient. They have a gate and a personal code to get in. It is a super safe area, which is really important to me.

7. There is always someone in the office to help you with whatever you need.

8. They have a huge 10x15  freight elevator.

9. They have 7 carts so no need to really carry things in and out.

I love this place and have used their service for 5 months. I'm super glad I did my research and was able to find the best storage company in the area!< /review>

<review>I've used this storage facility twice in the past four years, and have had an excellent experience both times. The online billing/payment system takes only seconds to use. Facilities are clean and cool and the elevator is enormous. The manager was also extremely nice about the cleanup when I dropped a giant glass tabletop and it shattered all over the loading dock.</review></record>

<review>My experience at SPS has been better than I could have ever expected.  Not only have I been provided with a great storage space, in a safe, secure and convenient location, and for a very reasonable price, but both Steve and Sergio have gone above and beyond with their assistance.  Whether to help with a light bulb, acquiring boxes, setting up cones to block off space for a moving truck or just to answer any of my day to day questions, both Steve and Sergio have been great.  I looked at numerous storage locations and am glad I made the choice I did.  I would recommend using SPS unequivocally to anyone.< /review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

I've smashed a few things between the locker and car; nobody gave me grief, which I appreciate.

The hours are a heckofanuisance. It's not open past 6pm and has limited hours to access your locker on Sundays. Between Silicon Valley traffic and a busy life; it's not ideal. But I make it work.

<review>I have been a client of Security Public Storage (SPS) now for a little over a year. The reason for my stroage needs was that I had to move out of the country on business and needed a storage unit  I could trust for keeping my goods safe, and place I could contact easily if needed.  I appreciate the cleanness of the location as this is important to me because  it indicates a level of integrity of how the business is run. The employees are very helpful and responsive. Over the past year, that I have been away, SPS has been responsive to all my needs, e.g. notifing me of my billing status, letting me know all was good, etc.  If I had to give four stars on a 5 star scale, it would receive 6!</review>< Pics>

This is by far the best storage facility on the Peninsula.  The facility is kept impeccably clean, there is always dollies or carts for over sized items and the service is top notch.<//Text>

Dined in for a working meeting. Customer service was really friendly. Had the bowl with rice, steak, veggies  and tomatoes. Had churros for dessert and it was pretty tasty. The churro had some sort of filling, tasted like almond.<//Text>

<Review>Came here while in the process of buying a car, it would be a great place to get lunch if you work in the area or are passing through. Full bar, lots of options and everything is prepared fresh right before you. There is done outdoor seating and a decent amount of space inside.</Review>< Rate>

Food was fresh, service was speedy and very accommodating to my preferences and my very 1st here since they opened this location 3 years ago...Staff was friendly too and my over all 1st impression and rating is a 5 out of 5 since 10+ is not an option. I would definitely return again on my way in town. Staff informed me that they have 1 other chain location in San Leandro. I will stop by there as well if and when I'm in the area again. Kudos to this establishment, I was impressed with everything about the food served. I just wish it was more visible within the shopping center. 😉👍🏽</Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

Awesome tacos at very reasonable prices! The beer brisket taco was fantastic and it's great they offer tequila based cocktails and draft beer. The staff behind the couter were super nice and made my first time there a pleasant experience. I can't wait to go back.<//text>

The worst Mexican food ever. The carne asada had zero flavor. Not even seasoned. The burrito i got was not even worth finishing. I also payed 2.25 for chips and salsa. I got maybe 12 chips in the bag. What a rip off. You can always judge a Mexican spot by their salsa and this place has no idea on how to make salsa. Will never eat here again.< /Review>

Usually decent food. Very pricey though. Cannot get their hours correct.  posted 10am-8pm. Was told they were closed at 6pm. After already walking inside and in line. All posted signs, and online say 8pm. Will never return.</Review>

This is an actual  bar, the set up is like subway where they have all the ingredients  spread out for you to choose. They make the tortillas fresh right there. They also have Margaritas to go.< /text>

<review>I was extremely impressed by this place. It's kind of like Chipotle but with more authentic Mexican flavor and ingredients. You go through the line to custom build tacos, burritos or bowls. It has all kinds of interesting toppings to choose from, like mango pico de gallo, Mexican cheese, and pickled onions. The carne asada and shrimp were delicious and they served chips and salsa along with the meal. They also had some refreshing infused waters and a complete bar.

The place is clean, modern looking and has some beautiful artwork painted on the walls that reminds me of dia los muertos murals. The kitchen/counter is bright and evenly lit, while the dining area is surrounded by the decor and has slightly moodier lighting. The staff was responsive and friendly. This was a very pleasant place to get a quick meal.</review>< Pictures>

Good selection, good  flavors and fast service.  Format  is like Chipotle - move down line and te them  what you  want  to  build  your  own taco, burrito or bowl. Pricing looks a bit  high until  you  see  the portions.<//review>

The only thing that would have been better is having a few more options. Granted when places start giving you all kinds of options it can be overpowering, but I feel that if there were a few more choices it could be even better. Other than that, my only complaint was it would be nice to have a salsa bar available as the salsa wasn't spicy and I prefer mine to be as spicy as possible, but here everyone gets the same salsa. Price was decent and you get a good amount of food though!<//review>

This is the most increadable place that I've ever had the pleasure of eating at. Food is wonderful anything you want on a burrito, you can have.i can't say it anymore blatantly but if you don't run over and try there food than your missing out on one of the most enjoyable Dining experiences you could have.
I truly mean this. So good.!!!!!.< /text>

I like the carnitas, its moister than I would have expected, but pleasantly surprised. Lots of good veg to add too.

Love this place!  They have a full Tequila bar right when you walk in.  The vibe is very welcoming and the food is on point.  Lots of vegetarian options and they have hand pressed tortillas which make all the difference!  This place is worth a try 🏅< /text>

<text>Poor customer service. They dint shy to bill us when food was served to the table and when we were eating, wherein they could have wrapped up the billing before or after eating. Bar lady was uneducated on non alcoholic drinks.
Food could be more fresh, vegetarians would have not a lot of options or end up eating bunch of colorful zucchinis. For the excellent rating they have this place could perform above average in customer service and food. Average!</text><pics>None</pics><user_name>Mahalakshmi Ramachandran</user_name></record>

You can even catch them making them if you come at the right time. Small menu, but we'll executed. Decent beverage selection as well despite the small location.

First time here we had no idea the place was here for over a year. We enjoyed each experience the taco bar the welcome by the staff the awesome bartender great margaritas and fantastic food. We also watched as the other drinks and food was prepared a presentation was incredible better than most restaurants in the area that you would pay Triple anywhere else. Really appreciate spending some time with the owner</text>

Went there for the first time today! DELICIOUS!!! Their Al Pastor and Carnitas are so flavorful. Highly recommend!
Update: had to bring it down 1 star. The shorter girl working there today has really bad customer service skills.</Text>

<user>117836547207022522754</user><Review>This is not a good place to go if you want to eat a good taco. When we walked in there it seemed really dead and low energy. I was under the impression that they were suppose to make the tortillas fresh. This was not the case. The tortillas were already premade and cold. The carne asada they placed in the taco was also cold. The “hot habanero salsa” had no spice at all. The table we sat at had food all over the ground. None of the staff even picked it up.

I can’t believe I paid $4 per taco. Robbed me of $20. Go support your local taco truck. This was trash food and service.< /Review><Time>1576467567281< /Time>< user_name>

<Text>Amazing food! I was greeted by a quick and friendly staff prior to my taste buds being greeted with the amazing taste of authentic ingredients. Lots of seating and a full bar make this place very welcoming for lunch or dinner. The minimalistic and clean interior design of the location also make this a fun place to check out. The only thing I could comment on is that they're going to be slightly more expensive than your local taqueria or market, however the few extra dollars is well worth the meal you get!< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None<//Response><gmapID>0x808fe717edac3ea3:0x138415bc3514107e</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Time>1527988567113< /Time><text>Walked in not knowing what to expect. You right away see a bar and then the next counter is where the food ordering starts. Pretty cool that the make the taco tortillas as you are ordering. I also liked that you can get cilantro on your tacos without onion unlike most places. Juice from the meats on the taco are super runny so it may be messy. we had carnitas and carne asada, if you don't eat quick enough your taco will get soggy.</text>< Rate>

Stumbled onto this place accidentally, while looking for another restaurant. It seemed inviting, with multiple patrons dining at tables on the little side patio outdoors. We ordered their individual tacos, which were good-sized, & you get to choose all the ingredients. We had ours loaded with carne asada, rice, black beans, salsa, sour cream, cheese, & more. They were mouth watering! Served with chips & salsa on the side, at no extra charge. They have a variety of meats, including pork & chicken. Loved this place, & we will definitely go back again!</review>

<text>Hot and fresh! Great atmosphere for casual dining.  Tortillas made to order for the tacos with a build your own taco, burrito or bowl option, choice of meat and unltd. amount of toppings making it worth the extra cost (of course guac is extra $). Beer on tap, small cocktail menu and tequila bar!  Will definitely visit again.</text>< pics>

<text>If you are a White person this is your place. Just because they make hand made tortillas it does not make a place that good.  I know taquerias that are waay better than this place!! I order a quesadilla and it was so simple that i would have been better off with a chalupa from taco bell.< /text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN4Dhb97H3c2gI8jAsZJp6_3V4k-NdAMHWtLa9G=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures>< response>

Good quality food and friendly staff. You can customize your food with lots of options for ingredients. The carnitas was a little bland but still good. The music was too loud making it hard to hear the girl behind the counter. Overall good eats.<//review>

What every Chipotle franchise wishes it could be. Fresh ingredients, a very nice beverage selection (including those of the adult sort), creative options, and a friendly staff make for a very nice experience.<//review>

<review>Quality food. Freahily made tortillas. Two key ingredients to perfect tacos. This place is newly opened and it is already a hit. The food here is so good, so at times there is quite a line out the door, but it is worth it. My only complaints could be the line moves a bit slower (freahily made tortillas, what do you expect?) And the price is a TAD high for something so simple. But hot damn they are good!< /review>< pictures>

<Text>The guys came to Livermore for the first time to visit me (I'm always driving down to San Jose to visit them), so I needed to take them somewhere really good. Cinco TacoBar delivered, and even my picky-eater-type friends polished off their burritos. I'm a big fan of build-your-own-burrito places, and this place delivers in spades, with a large number of fillings. In particular, this is the first time I've encountered a place serving fresh queso! Obviously, there were other things on the menu, but I went with the burrito. The horchata hit the spot right after lunch! Pro tip: Get it without ice, you'll get way more of your drink. Great place for lunch, maybe a bit on the pricey side.<//Text>< Pictures>

<Review>Amazing burritos! Had a drink called pink senorita that kept a smile on my face as well. My only critique, no fountian drink dispenser. Plenty of regular can & bottle sodas, juices ect...
Had to get my daughter a really big snapple tea. The lime or Orange infused waters that they have on the counters for free are extremely refreshing. My family and I will be making a trip back for sure!</Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

Just finished my burrito and it was so good I felt compelled to write a review while I can still taste it. I had carne asada burrito and wife had chicken bowl with guacamole and both were fantastic and made to order to go in front of us. Spicy salsa too! They have a full bar serving mixed drinks which was unexpected due to the small size of the place. Drinks and bar looked very professional. I've been to 30+ Mexican restaurants in the Tri valley and this is instantly now in my top 5. Don't be fooled by small storefront or the old taco bell location,  it has my 2 thumbs up!  Clean stylish dining area too. 6/5 stars for my first visit!< /Review>< pictures>

A Chipotle for hipsters too hip for Chipotle. Food was ok, but not very flavorful. Taco tortillas were too small for the amount of ingredients piled on it. The dining area was far too noisy--it was difficult to hear other diners at my table during a busy lunch service. Ultimately, the food and experience didn't justify the price. There are better Mexican options in Livermore.< /text>

A great spot for a Friday work lunch. Get here early or late, cause it's always busy. Nice mix of seating, decor and ambiance are nice. The food is the real star here. Made to order tacos, quesadillas, burritos etc with a vast array of customizable toppings. I've liked all the fillings I've tried, but the surprise standout is the grilled veggie mix. Corn, zucchini, peppers, tomatoes and onions with beautiful carmelization, great in a taco or quesadilla. It's a good, filling lunch at a good price.</Review>

<review>This place looks cool, but the food is over priced tacobell. The meat honestly tastes the same. This place is a pretentious mess trying to do tacos with style when they can't even get the basics right. And the atmosphere was way to loud, save yourself and go to one of the other Mexican food establishments in the area you will be doing yourself a favor, and saving money.</review><Pics>None<//Pics>< userid>

<review>I went to Cinco Taco Bar looking for seasoned Carne Asada and what I got was bland chopped beef on a tortilla.  I asked for onions and cilantro and the guy sprinked 10 bits of onion and less than one stalk of cilantro so I had to repeat myself three times.  The salsa was cooked and I'm not a fan.  They also charge extra for avocado.  Overall I won't be making a special trip back.</review></record></dataset><record>

Tortillas were way too thick, which meant they were undercooked in the middle. The meats were all bland. Really disappointing.< /Text>

One of the few legit, Japanese run and owned sushi restaurants around. Appreciate the quality of the seafood and daily specials. I used to complain about the attitude and service, but that is now a thing of the past. Service was friendly and efficient during times of Covid. Nothing was missing from our order and everything tasted fantastic. Should not have waited so long to come back. Will be part of my regular rotation now that we have rediscovered this place.< /text>

I've been going to Yashima's for 25+ years, my children, friends, and family all love it.  Never disappointed!
Even when I don't feel like going out I get it to go.  Always the best!</Review>

We were so happy and excited to be in our home town for Japanese food. We were able to participate in outdoor dining. We have eaten there for many many years. Cheerful service, friendship, helpful, plus we always feel welcome.
Thanks again, arigato guzimus.

Yikes sushi quality needs some work. Price point is fair but the sushi that we ordered to go was sub-par to bad. Really surprised because I was recommended by a friend, but I was not delighted at all with taste and texture of the sushi.<//Review>

<text>Fantastic old school Japanese restaurant that would be right at home in Gardena, but it's hiding out in Covina. The food is great and the sushi chefs are top notch. Parking is in the back and you might have a bit of a wait at peak times. This is probably my Mom's favorite place to eat, and that's high praise coming from a 3rd generation Japanese American.<//text></record></dataset><record>

The best Japanese restaurant food I've ever tasted. And I've been to other Japanese restaurants. Others fail by comparison. Food is always fresh and authentic Japanese and the waitresses are affable and  quick to serve.<//Review>

The Avocado Salad is very refreshing and delicious.    The spicy tuna hand rolls are superv.  Oh and don't forget to order the green tea drink warm or over ice, it's delicious...not your typical Green Tea.</text>

This is the best sushi restaurant in Covina in my opinion .  Sushi is fresh, big and salmon nigiri melts in your mouth.  the best albacore capacio you will ever have. A small hole in the wall type restaurant so look out for it.  Honest reviewer.< /review>

Next best thing to dinner in Japan. Well-established and full of loyal patrons. Sushi is fantastic and fresh, prepared right in front of you. Tempura, teriyaki, udon; all outstanding. Lovely owner, Sachico.</Review>

WHAT IT IS
Sushi restaurant and bar. They also have your typical bento combinations and "kitchen" meals. A tip: Parking is behind the restaurant.

WHAT YOU SHOULD ORDER
Sushi!

AMBIANCE
4 stars
It's a fairly basic Japanese restaurant. When you enter from the street you, will be in a small foyer with tables all around you. To your right you will see the sushi bar. They have a few TVs on the walls as well. The music both times I've gone in is American, which is sort of unique for these sorts of places.

FOOD AND DRINKS
4 Stars
Both times I've been here I ordered the Nigiri plate which comes with a california roll and 8 pieces of assorted nigiri. The sushi here is fairly good. It's nothing that will blow you away, but it's fresh and doesn't commit any "cardinal sushi sins". I prefer a bit more vinegar in my rice.

The nigiri have a good fish to rice ratio. The fish cuts are thick, so you get a good amount of fish for your buck.The rice is sticky and holds up well. None of my nigiri fell apart upon being picked up. This is hugely important in a western sushi restaurant as I'm embarrassed to eat the nigiri properly (with my fingers) and opt to use the chopsticks instead. Nothing is worse than watching as the rice falls apart when you try to pick up your nigiri!

There was a good assortment of nigiri as well--8 different flavors! They were all delicious.

The California Roll was the lowpoint--the filling lacked flavor and there was a bit too much celery. It wasn't awful, but it was nothing to write home about.

The meal also comes with miso soup and a small salad. The salad is good. I don't know what's in their dressing, but I like it. Aside from that it's just your basic salad--iceburg lettuce and some red cabbage. The miso soup was another nice surprise--it was so flavorful! The tofu in it was wonderful too--soft and fresh. I've had SO many bad tofu cubes in miso soup over the years, so it's awesome to find a place that puts fresh tofu in their soup!

NICE SURPRISES
The assortment of Nigiri with the special is a nice touch, especially because many of the places around here limit you to 4 varieties of fish with these types of combos (opting to give you two of each instead). The miso soup was also a delight.

OVERALL
This is a great place for lunch. The service is quick--both lunches took me just under 40 minutes (and both times the restaurant was crowded.) You can call ahead and pick up your order too.< /Text>

My guy that takes care of our property is not only someone  I trust but someone I truly am grateful to have taking care of our property. Not to mention how cordial and professional he is... and how safe he makes my children and wife feel when I’m not even around. He’s part of the family!< /text>

The serviceman that came out was Eddie. He  on time and he was very professional  friendly . He started after his inspection with treating our property.  He was very focused in the job being done. I almost went with Terminix but my neighbor used Orkin  for years. Or can with a little less and price that was in my budget that I can afford. What I recommend work and yes I would. I just started with this company  And so far I'm happy with my 1st service today.  A close relative of mine was visiting that is the military. He was flying his drone over our  home and he told me he saw 5 Orkin work  trucks at different neighbors houses in the neighborhood and thought that I should consider this company.  That was the big indicator for me to make the decision to go with Orkin. I'm not saying anything bad about Terminix because 20 years ago I used them for pest control and they did a fabulous job at that time, but this time around is now going to be Orkin because of their price.< /text>

Two Orkin service persons arrived on time.  They were well-dressed (white shirt and tie) and got right to work screening off openings in the attic and outside roof areas.  They worked quickly and effectively.  I was pleased with the service.< /Review>

I was told by the Orkin sales associate the $395 one-time charge included a thorough inspection of my attic, removal of all nests, pups, and a complete sealing of all access points where rodents could be entering my attic. The tech was in the attic only 20 minutes, did not take any materials to seal any holes, and told us we didn’t have any places where rodents could enter (we hear rats running around up there at night). He set 4  spring traps in the garage and left in less than an hour. I called Orkin to complain. It has been 4 hours since and no response. Zero stars.< /text>

I was dealing with a major infestation of ants, flies, spiders, silverfish and moths that was only getting worse. Joshua treated my entire condo quickly after we discussed the problem. I saw 2 ants after he left then woke up this morning to find zero bugs in my condo. I'd recommend Orkin and Joshua to anyone.

UPDATE: 08/13/2020. Joshua's been back twice since the initial service. He came 30 days after the first treatment for a follow-up, and again today for the bi-monthly treatment. I had to reschedule at the last minute last week - literally the morning of my appointment. Joshua was totally understanding and flexible. He rescheduled and came out today. He arrived on time, wearing a mask, and was very attentive in following up on my previous issues. He's familiar with the layout here since he's been out twice before so he was in and out in minutes. Joshua's professional, VERY knowledgable, and always on time. I still recommend Orkin to get the job done!< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics><response>{'time': 1590774832770, 'text': "Thanks so much for that five-star review and especially your kind words about Joshua.

<Rate>5</Rate><review>Orkin comes out several times yearly to spray the perimeter of my house for ants and knock down spider webs. The technicians are always polite and proficient. I get text and phone and email messages about the appointment time, their arrival and progress of work. Since the pandemic, they have instituted policies which make it unnecessary to interact directly with technician but if you do so, they wear masks.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>{'time': 1600204277870, 'text': 'Thank you very much for that kind review.

Called company for rats in the attic..Guy comes in looks around, doesn’t even go on the root or into the attic says area is not accessible (but apparently the rats can) I asked him what’s the next set, he said I have no solution for you and walked away. Super helpful....< /Review>

Once he finished, he told me what I should expect and offered a follow up visit to make sure everything was working right.

< Review>
I am happy with the pest control operators.  They are professional and know how to treat yard and grounds. Also they are knowledgeable and use organic products since I have a dog!
However, the business office operations are very bad and they do not respond to me.  They don’t send me an invoice for 3-4 weeks afterward or never, after service (I do not pay for service in advance), Mess up my account balance, always wanting me to pay a bill I already did, and never informs me or works with me for a  convenient time for service person to come out.  So service person shows up unannounced ( he thinks I’ve been informed by office) or if he has my phone no., he calls me when he’s 5 min. away or has arrived!  Office Very inconsiderate with no room for respect.  K. Briggs< /Review>

Orkin is amazing! I love our technician, Drew, because he is thorough and honest...plus is very knowledgeable and willing to share that knowledge. My favorite thing about this company is that if you ever need them between services, they will come back out. I tell everyone that Orkin is my favorite bill to pay each month! :) With a family of four and four pets, safety is our number one concern and I feel safe with Orkin.<//Review>

<Text>ORKIN IS AWESOME. Had one problem over the ten years I’ve been working with them (wasn’t really even a problem, just a difference in compatibility). It was addressed immediately and taken care of.  I had another service person assigned to my house the next day. I always feel safe when they’re here and they are never late. If I need additional services it’s usually the next day. Hire them, they’re amazing!<//Text>< user>

<review>I spoke to three pest service providers and chose Orkin because of it's national name and longevity in business.  When I first contacted Orkin by phone, the person on the other end didn't want to know what the specific problem was that I was having, but just wanted to sign me up for service. He never took my phone number either to provide to his serviceman. On three separate occasions so far, and it's only been a few weeks, the service man never came at the agreed upon time. Today he was supposed to return to bring back a bait station and to check the traps from 12-2, and needless to say, he never showed. I can only come to the conclusion that Orkin is not dependable, professional or organized.  I will give it another month, if they don't get their act together I will have to cancel and go with another service.<//review>< pictures>

I want to give a shout out to Aaron for his kind customer service.
I live in the new community Wagon Wheel / Mayfair in Oxnard & Aaron is always happy and polite. When you ask him questions he always knows what he is talking about. Thank you Aaron for showing there are professionals that still have great service.</Text>

<Review>I’ve always had a great experience with Orkin. We’ve used Orkin for probably 15+ years. They have always been extremely professional and attentive to any issues we were having with insects. The communication between myself and the service technicians have always been great. For awhile now, our technician has been Jay. Jay always texts me the day before service to remind me that he will be at my home at a certain time so that I can bring my dogs in. That is always helpful for me and for him. Orkin’s service fees are reasonable and well worth the money. We rarely see any insects. Yay!!< /Review>< Pictures>

<Text>Ever since using have had no pest problems.  They always tell me when the day before arriving and asking me if I have any questions.  Also, I have 2 dogs and they are always safe as they spray.  Very nice people.

Its been some time passing and I still am very happy with Orkin.  A call before they come over, extremely friendly when talking to, do a great job and I really don't see any little pests running around at all.<//Text>< pics>

Orkin has always been here when we need them. Flexible and always helpful if we need an emergency visit. They are professional, calling to leave a message before they arrive, thoughtful to remind us of dos and don’ts if there are pets in the house and they keep the ants , fleas and spiders under control.< /Text>

Today was another lovely example of why I use them. Dedrick is such a bright individual and I am happy he’s our set technician! I’m not normally home for the pest control stuff and glad I was today. Made my day.<//Text>

We have used Orkin services for several years. We had a terrible problem with ants in our home but since Orkin has been treating our yards we haven’t had any ants inside. They are very dependable; professional and pleasant to work with. Our technician, Keith, is very thorough. We can highly recommend Orkin.<//Review>

<Text>Best PEST contract. Technicians are great, experienced, and always helpful. Had a few people stung by what we thought were bees. Real change in behavior as our bees were always very chill. Turned out they were Yellowjackets. Treatment done. Any pests, they can handle.< /Text>< Pictures>

Seeing a swarm of bees was alarming! When I called Orkin last evening I was told that someone would contact me but no one ever did. This morning however my local Orkin guy Donovan came by early to help with this problem.  Donovan explained my options and as always was very helpful! He is very knowledgeable, kind , and professional .<//Review>

<Review>Our Orkin Tech is very friendly, educational and does a thorough job fighting off the many pests where we live. I really appreciate the fact that they will call in advance to let you know they’re coming so I can be home and provide access to areas they would not be able to reach like balconies and garage. Jay is our Tech and he’s fabulous!< /Review>< user_name>

My tenants left a real mess but Keith was able to work it out. I would recommend Keith highly to anyone who has need of his services. He is an asset to Orkin. I’m glad Orkin has him on their team.

Since Orkin began regular visits, my house is no longer overrun with ants.
The Orkin man always call the day before he arrives. He is always polite. He is always quiet when gets here early in the morning. He leaves the charge statement in the screen door. We really appreciate the great service.<//review>

Like in every business, customer service is key. I’ve never had to deal with anyone in the office except for initionalizing service. My Orkin man is above and beyond super! His knowledge, professionalism and kindness supersedes my expectations. Orkin is a little bit on the higher end of what I think I should be paying for this service, but because of or guy, we are staying put!!! Our Orkin man is definitely an asset to the company!!!</review>

Devin was amazing with regard to customer service!
He treated our home for ants today and told us we should see less of them in a few days. The little black ants are some of the hardest to get rid of so we will have to wait and see how it goes. But he was beyond knowledgeable and super friendly!<//review>

Orkin has been our pest controller since the .80s but recently had to boost up our coverage for rodents and gophers.  In 2-3 weeks, Nathan, my tech,  had all things under conttol.  Now I am back to enjoying my backyard.  Thank you Nathan/Orkin very much!

Seriously, we appreciate all you do to keep us pest free.  Thanks to our Orkin Crew!!< /text>

Orkin technician, Jorge, is a great representative for the company, he loves his job, knows what he is doing and he does it well...I couldn't be happier with his work ethic. He is quite observant, spotting pests and potential areas of pests before I can bring them to his attention..again, very happy with his service.<//Text>

I have subscribed to their service for over 13 years. Prior to having pest control, we had non stop ants. At one point, we had many mice, spiders, and a baby rattle snake.

If we ever experience additional pests, I call Orkin and they send out someone to take care of the issue at no additional charge.

We have a small dog and he has never been harmed by any aspects of the pest control.< /review>

I’ve used orkin for almost 4years and the service is always great! All my insect and mouse problems are resolved quickly and my home is bug free. My current service person Cassidy is new for me and she has been awesome! So responsive, professional and helpful. It is amazing to know that you can call her and she’ll be there as quick as she can to help you while she is still taking care of others. Outstanding service!< /review>

I have been an Orkin customer for a number of years, I have generally recieved fair service. However we got a new Tech by the name of Deidrick,  I was watching him work, usually the other techs have come and gone in 1/4 of the time that he was here. The job he did was more than outstanding, he did the most consciences and thronal job I have ever seen. It prompted me to go out and Thank Him , (as should you.) You have a Great Employee in Deidrick and He needs to know this!!!</review>

The sales consultant, Fred was professional and showed genuine interest in my issues. He promised a technician would arrive the next day and itvhaspened. The technician, Dedrick arrived the next morning and spent 90 minutes going thru my home and checking every possible entrance for pest. Additionally, he cleared evey cob web outside from past and present spiders. My past company never spent 90 minutes in any three trips... Very pleased thus far!</review>

< review>
I have subscribed to their service for over 13 years. Prior to having pest control, we had non stop ants. At one point, we had many mice, spiders, and a baby rattle snake.

If we ever experience additional pests, I call Orkin and they send out someone to take care of the issue at no additional charge.

We have a small dog and he has never been harmed by any aspects of the pest control.<//review>

I recently met Jay Ayala in my neighborhood when he we was providing pest control service for my neighbor. I was unhappy with my previous pest control service. I explained to him my issues and he was more than happy to educate me on Orkin service. Jay promptly came to my home the following week. He is so professional, friendly and knowledgeable. Jay completely resolved my pest control problems!!!!!!</Text>

Rep comes once a month.
Always calls the day before to let me know.
Always leaves a report.
No rats have eaten the inside of my cars engine compartment since the service started.
Satisfied.

We have used Orkin for decades at our old house, and now in our new house we started service here as well. With a newly constructed house, there is always going to be dirt stirred up, causing bugs to find their way around. Cassidy is awesome! She has been out right away when something comes up.< /review>

The communication with this company leaves a lot to be desired.  They just show up to treat your house even when you are not home.  They charge your card a different amount than your contract and won’t respond to your ask them, making you dispute it with your credit card company.  Worst of all they will not respond when you cancel the service.  They just show up unannounced and charge your card.  I would not ever recommend this company.<//review>
