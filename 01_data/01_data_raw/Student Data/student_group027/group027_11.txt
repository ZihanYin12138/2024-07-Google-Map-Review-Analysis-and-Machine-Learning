Great gym in the winter time, they refuse to run the air conditioning when it’s 90° outside. I literally can’t use my membership until it cools down.< /Review>

<time>1614957848739<//time><Rating>1<//Rating><review>I had to close my membership because I was moving down to LA. I had about 53 maybe $56 in commissaries(water, gatorades, etc.) the lady told me that I should expect one final payment on the 15th. I asked her if she could take the money for that final payment out of the commissary money that's left over and if she could cash me out the rest of the money. They had told me "nope" and forced me to buy two cases of water at 56 bucks for both of them. MAKING ME PAY 28 BUCKS PER CASE(24PACK) and still having to wait till the 15th to pay FOR THE LAST PAYMENT.... I only got this gym because planet fitness was still closed but obviously it was a huge mistake I'm never going back to this gym ever complete ripoff don't care about their customers at all< /review>< pics>

Equipment is 40 years old and in bad shape. Grease those machines so they flow. It's so cold in there due to running fans. Nothing is aired up smh. They take your money but don't address the simple things like air up your balls cold af in there lose the fans</Review>

The actual gym itself is very nice, small, but functional and well kept.

Sadly I cannot in good consciousness actually recommend you go here. I had a 12 month contract that expired several months ago, yet I am still charged monthly. After they closed for a short time for COVID-19, the charges stopped, and I had assumed that was the end of them. Sadly now that they are reopened, the charges have started again.

Heed what other 1 and 2 star reviews tell you and stay away, there are better options in the area. They will fight with you both on the phone and in person that they cannot for some reason end your contract, giving excuse after excuse. I don't make very much money, and even their relatively small charges every month can be absolutely backbreaking.

To any employees of the business who choose to read this, I am setting up a flag with my bank to stop any future payments to your company.<//review>

Equipment in good shape and clean.  Can’t beat the price- 10 to 15$ monthly with no contract!
Needs a filtered water fountain / cooler. Newly remodeled group fitness area made a huge difference in the vibe.  Very motivating fitness classes led by Certified Personal Trainers (extra cost for classes).
Most clients seem to be there to actually work out- no bench hog texters , or narcissistic fashion show princesses  (no offense) Not a bad gym if you want to get in, work out and not be distracted. Would recommend.<//Text>

<review>I wish I read the reviews before I signed up. Trying to cancel is literally impossible. You basically have to move out of state in order to cancel. I had moved outside their 25 miles and they will not cancel my membership even when I showed proof of my new address unless i paid my current month the following month plus the fees. And they continue to bill you unless you pay. They wont cancel. What they do not tell you is that it takes 30 days to process from the date your letter is postmarked. They are just looking to take your money. Horrible, horrible experience. Makes me want to avoid any and all gyms in the future.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmapID>

<Date>1504235583833< /Date><rating>1<//rating><review>To start off. I use to work at a gym so I know how gyms work. If you move more than 25 miles away you have to send in a certified letter. I did that and Karen the "manager" of this so called "gym" states that she never received it. She is harassing my wife and employees at my previous place of employment. If after reading every horrible review about this place you still decide to sign their "contract" do not give her any "references" she will just harass them as well. I would give this place 0 stars if I could but I guess a bad review and complaint to the BBB will have to do.</review>< pictures>

I love this gym because it has decent equipment and the people are very nice that work here especially the owner of the gym. Most of the time they play good music, and also you can plug in your own device to a stereo that they have in the crossfit room. I didn't mention this, but they have a crossfit room too with so many bars and plates so you can do deadlifts and other practices with the bars. They have multiple medicine balls and ropes hanging from the ceiling to climb. There is a huge bar hooked up to the wall that you can do pull ups on or muscle ups. Also, there is a huge tractor tire to lift. Overall, this gym is pretty nice.<//Text>

Took proof multiple times and they lose or dont have it anymore money hungry , unorganized when it comes to paperwork, training, the gym equipment is a joke. Its only good if u live close and dont want much. Tho if u plan to move or go onto service they will not care what u bring in they just conveniently lose or never had it now i need to pay 50$ and prove once more i moved if i where down there id through a rally agenst the place and it would be known sick of these people and giveing them paperwork for them to just lose</review>

Love this local treat shop! They have everything and at a good price. Homemade cookies, delicious ice cream and milkshakes, even candy!

The owners are wonderful and very nice, and they were also able to do a really quick turnaround on a birthday cake that was both beautiful and delicious!< /text>

<review>My family and I used to come here a lot when they first opened. They were the only ones near us that had vegan options. Unfortunately, the vegan options started declining and the flavors got worse. Our favorite was the snickerdoodle which the whole family got double scoops of every time and they took that away and started adding awkward flavors like “espresso Oreo” ? Or mint chocolate chip and lately it’s just been sherbet only. I really enjoyed the good vegan options while they lasted but sadly they haven’t returned and neither have we. This place is still a 5 star for customer service and the overall atmosphere just wish they had better vegan options for our family.<//review></record>

< Review>
OMG!!! You can not go wrong with anything in this cafe.  Ice cream and cookies are out of this world.

It has been a month since the last time I was in the shop and they remembered me and my favorites.  Now that's personal professional service!!

Must try the hot cheetos white chocolate bar 🍫. Trust me, just try it.<//Review>

Date Nite 😊 Happiness
Went for a walk, listened to a good book, stooped for our first ice cream scoops. Had apple pie and pumpkin pie ice cream each and they couldn't have been better! Service was great, people were great, treats were great. Go there!!</Text>

<text>What a great find! A sweet tooth's paradise! You can't go wrong at C&A! Delicious ice cream, cookies and treats. We haven't tried the milk shakes but based on what my family and I have had, it has to be another no miss treat! The friendly service is the cherry on top!

C & A Creamery is our favorite place to go to for ice cream and a special treat in the Santa Clarita Valley. The staff is super friendly and wants your experience to be a happy and tasteful one. All ingredients in the ice cream are of excellent quality and they have great vegan choices to accommodate customers.  I personally can’t wait to try their new sandwiches.

We have tried the carrot cake, Nutella, apple pie, strawberry, mango, mint chocolate chip and cookie dough ice creams. All were so delicious! Their Turkish coffee & home made cookies are amazing too! Especially the peanut butter chocolate cookies and all over sprinkles cookie. The owner and his wife are super nice and you can tell they really pour their heart into their business. If you haven’t visited yet we highly recommend them! It’s our new favorite place!!< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmap_id>

This place is amazing! The mango sorbet and lemon bar cookies are delicious. The staff was awesome too, I would highly recommend this place if you’re in the mood for some sweets.< /Review>

Was in dire need for a Fro-yo fix. Decided to go to Bear Hugs for my first frozen yogurt in California. I’ve been to several frozen yogurt places throughout Arizona before moving here, and I have to say that I loved going to Bear Hugs! The gentleman, possibly the owner, was friendly, courteous and super helpful. I was pleasantly surprised to see not only Frozen Yogurt and Sorbet but also Italian Ice and Gelato! The flavors were great and topping selection was right on point.

Also, decided to bring my boyfriend with me, because he had never had frozen yogurt before. He was extremely surprised at how much he enjoyed frozen yogurt instead of ice cream. We will definitely be returning and would recommend this for great Fro-yo.</text>

<rating>4<//rating><review>Our family always has a delightful time at Bear Hugs. It is our go-to for celebrating fun events (like good report cards). We love the crepes that were recently added to the menu. 😍 It can be a bit pricey for a big family, but they have $5 Fridays (a cup of frozen yogurt is $5 after 8 pm on Fridays). They also have $5/cup during lunchtime- I believe from 11-2ish (or somewhere in that time frame) on Monday- Thursdays. 😊< /review>< Pictures>

Frozen yogurt? Surprisingly really good. The people were very helpful as well. When I asked some allergy related questions they found all the information I needed in moments with no hassle.</Text>

Friendly place. Typical frozen yogurt shop with toppings.  I went today and was surprised that they are now offering crepes as part of their menu!< /text>

Decent place for Fro-Yo and other types of desserts. Can be kind of pricey, but service is good and place is clean.</Text>

Ridgecrest is definitely the last place on planet earth I would expect to see a frozen yogurt shop. And you'd think that a shop located in an area so far out into the middle of nothingness would play it safe with a selection of generic flavors, but the flavors they serve here are incredibly unusual, like peanut brittle and salted caramel and matcha green tea. I'd revisit if I ever had the misfortune of finding myself in Ridgecrest again.</Text>

<text>I had a horrible experience here just tonight. Not only did it take the staff member a few minutes to acknowledge me after I got to the counter to pay for my yogurt, but I was then told that the giant sign that says “54 cents per once” is apparently false advertisement. I noticed when selecting my cups that there was only 1 type of cup out and was told that we just weigh them at the end and we put however much we want in them. So I got two cups, one with a tiny amount for my three year old and one with a lil bit more for me. When the staff member finally came over to help me, I was told my total was over $10 because I had selected their “$5 cup”. Which I thought was ridiculous since it was the only cup available and their sign clearly read that the price was 54 cents per once. I tried to explain that it was the only cup available and that the one was for my three year old and 5 dollars was clearly way overpriced for the tiny amount I got. The response I received was very rude and not good customer service at all. I left at that point and will not be going back.< /text>< Pics>

<text>My new storage is at 914 Hopper Ave. The person who was on duty in Thursday 6/3/21 at about 2pm was extremely helpful. She explained every thing to me and instructed me on how to open the gate and made it very easy for me to find my unit. When I got to my unit, I could not open the door. I called her and she did the long walk and showed me how to get the door open. She was very helpful and pleasant.<//text><pictures>None< /pictures><Rate>5</Rate><Time>1622833401050</Time></record></dataset><record>

My lock was cut at Public Storage and have not been compensated. This facility has had multiple break-ins to storage units, I suggest to look elsewhere to keep your things. They didn't inform me of the break-ins until after I had my stuff stolen. This business has terrible customer service, they have made no attempt to reimburse me or compensate me for their inability to protect my property.

If you want to keep your property from the public I suggest you don't use Public Storage.</review>

I have visited this facility several times over the past few weeks to purchase boxes and moving supplies for my home. The young man Eric working there is very welcoming and helpful and the facility itself seems well maintained (though I don't actually rent a space there myself). Thank you Eric. I enjoyed our talks :)</review>

Very bad customer service from one lady Eric was easy for me to speak with but the one lady short temper confused didn't know what she was doing didn't care about what I was even saying or asking for I've paid my storage fee all ready and tried to get a bigger unit I'll tell you people if your not working with Eric they will take your money. Again then send you a check in the mail needless to say I got stuck in my little unit a headache 63 dollars less and confused. As to why they couldn't give my money back. Idk .good luck figuring this one out my reviews are plor< /Text>

These guys are awesome.  The best of the best.  They really worked with us when we needed it so much.  Staff is awesome and I just can't say enough good about them.  I have used storage companies before, but these guys are really the best.< /Text>

<Review>The storage units are clean and safe and the manager, Carole Jean, is awesome.  It is very obvious that she cares about the place and the people that store their valuables here.  Always on site, Carole regularly walks around, making sure the only people on the property are those that should be here.  I have my most important things stored here because I trust them to be protected.

Oh yeah, and it's also the BEST deal I could find in all of Sonoma County!<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None<//resp><Gmap_id>0x80843892758cbc03:0xe976cb6193cb6ce0<//Gmap_id></record>

They worked with my team and I to get the best value from our rental. When the unit we had was left unlocked, we were given a call to let us know. When we are back in this area to do work, there is no other place we would go to for storage! thanks again.</Review>< Name>

Renting a storage unit at this location was very easy ! Diane and Carole are fantastic, Diane made my move in very easy and fast. I arrived and my unit was clean and waiting for me! They are very friendly, helpful and explain everything when you check in. They have supplies in the office/lobby if you need to purchase last minute moving supplies, etc. They go over the policies, insurance and etc. Moving and storing is not always fun so do yourself a favor and visit this facility, it will make things much easier and you won't be sorry.</Text>

<Text>I can’t say enough good things about Carole and the overall state of Public Storage in Santa Rosa. You can see the pride she takes in making every interaction positive and personal. Carole has been very helpful and understanding from the day we set up my account. This is by far the best experience I’ve had with any storage facility.< /Text>< Time>

I don’t ever write reviews, not only do I lack the time, but I rarely find myself in a position that I really feel obligated too. Today is different, much different.
I obviously rented a storage unit, and currently still have one, but that’s not what I’m writing as a review.
I’m writing in regards to Carole , the property manager. She is a gem of a lady. So kind so nice so helpful, and a little crass in her own way too. Which is obviously a great mixture for perfect customer service. A perfect mixture of sweet and stern. Even when I have no need of any kind to enter the office, I do anyway, just to say hi to Carole. She has a great face and a fabulous personality.
Thank you Carole for making my trips to my storage unit better. Because you do!

<text>I rent a ton of storage units all over the states for work, and I have never had a positive experience from any public storage like I have had from Carole here. SHE IS AMAZING, so easy and caring to work with. She has helped us out in a time of need, very easy to get ahold of. Clean units, safe location, tons of stuff in the office to get if you need to box something up or cover anything. I would highly recommend this Public Storage on Hopper Ave.</text><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

< Review>
I have rented a space here for the last 9 months. Five stars for the manager Carol! She's so friendly, and so helpful. She keeps the property very clean. The grounds are free of debris. The bathroom is sparkling. The storage units are clean and the roll-up doors are in working order. In my nine months I have seen a few inconsiderate renters leave large furniture items in the yard. Carol has those items removed immediately!

The owners really need to recognize Carol for the exceptional manager that she is. When she was away on medical leave late last year, whoever was filling in was lazy, uncaring, unfriendly, and constantly had an authoritative attitude. There was debris everywhere, hallways never got swept, furniture left behind by inconsiderate renters was never removed. I almost moved, but fortunately I didn't. As soon as Carol came back, everything was back to ship shape in less than a week! I am very happy renting a storage unit at this facility as long as Carol is in charge.</Review>

I stopped by to get some information on the storage units for my parents.  I was greeted with a smile by a woman who introduced herself as Saundra.  I can not say enough about her friendly, professional, courteous manner. I have been in business over 40 years and it is always a pleasure to see there are some people out there that still know how to do business the right way!  I will definitely be back!  Thank you!< /text>

Darcy was outstanding and a pleasure to work with! I rented my space yesterday afternoon. She was very detailed and thorough with the process of renting the space. No question went unanswered, in fact, she supplied information on some things I didn't know to ask about. She showed me the space and how to secure my lock properly. She helped me select the proper moving materials based on my rental space. I am very happy to be a Public Storage customer. Darcy is an outstanding representative of both the Company and the Hopper Ave. location. I look forward to working with her in the future.< /text>

The service at this Public
Storage has been excellent and Carol has been especially wonderful to work with over our past  year of renting there. Our things have been kept safe from all kinds of damage (including escaping the fires last fall) for which we have been incredibly grateful. I would highly recommend this location especially to anyone wishing to store their things, short or long-term.</text>

<review>Carole was very professional and helpful! I've never had to use a storage unit before and she did a great job of explaining the accessibility of my storage unit as well as the ins and outs of my account. The facility is clean and well kept. Kudos to her and the staff at Public Storage.</review><GmapID>0x80843892758cbc03:0xe976cb6193cb6ce0<//GmapID><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

Carole the manager is amazing. She keeps the place clean and tighty. Is communicative, as well as a good person and great manager. I like hopper Ave. Public storage. I know my belongings and memories are safe. You get what you pay for 😉

<Text>I called them  and a manager named Darcy answered. they were very friendly on the phone it's very accessible to the freeway and food locations. Also near the bus. I showed up to the location both Darcy and Carole were again very friendly and fast the gave me the rate quoted and gave me a tour of the location. It was very clean and secure. No matter what your needs they can help in most cases, they went above and beyond the public storage duties to make it the best experience possible. Everything was put in front of me straight and very clear and to the point I am very satisfied.< /Text></record>

From start to finish, we both thought this was the best public storage experience we've ever had. Everything was accounted for, the spaces were clean, and everything was in order before we got there. We couldn't decide on the size we wanted but she happily showed us 3 units and we chose one finally. We had to leave when we realized we had been there for almost an hour simply chatting about Disneyland and how fun it is to go. Thank you!<//text>

I have rented from Public Storage before. It was a good experience last time. I am delighted to say, I choose wisely in selecting PS again! Carole is a delight! She made the whole process of acquiring my unit seamless. Her banter and engaging conversation helps make the tedium of signing documents go by in a flash. I especially appreciate the time shown to explain all the options regarding insurance and notification when I decide to cancel. I highly recommend Public Storage and specifically Carole in Santa Rosa!

So, I called in for prices, and spoke with Darcy. I was told that they did not have the particular type of unit I was looking for, but she was SO helpful and courteous when letting me know my options at another facility. I really appreciate the great customer service she provided me! Such a joy to speak with someone who enjoys their job.<//review>

<Time>1568152503288</Time><Text>Just rented a month at the Hopper location to have a little extra storage space in the aftermath of a hectic move and very much enjoyed the fantastic customer service we received and the high level of professionalism the showed regards to our storage needs.

My fiancè and I made the reservation for a 5×10 the night before (super easy website to navigate!) and were helped by Diana the next day. She was super nice and very helpful! Obviously knew her job in & out and cared about the customer. It wasnt busy when we went in so we didnt have to wait to be helped. We also did the express check in prep available online when you reservce (without a card  and obligation) so everything went super quick&smoothly in check in. We were shown the unit, confirmed our info, and were given a run down of prices and how everything went as far as payment options, when rent was due, how the first month was prorated, etc. She explained everything in a very easy to understand and remember manner, and we didnt have any questions at the end. She also told us about supplies on hand and dollys available during office hours (gate hours are even longer than office hours which is great! Units available until 9 p.m. which was a big plus for us.) We got a good rate because they have a fall promo going on right now so the unit was 50%off. There is a one time admin fee ($24)  when you first sign up & we did buy a $18 ($19?) lock but its a heavy duty one that all storage units will accept & you take it with you when you leave (if you have one can provide your own and they give you a sticker) Also its good to know that if you dont have renters or home insurance you that would cover your unit you have to buy insurance (varys from $11-$15 a month covering $3-5k of storage stuff) Overall we felt good about are choice and secure in our unit. If an extra 50 sq. ft. sounds helpful they have good deals going on now and we would highly suggest this place!< /Text><response>None<//response>< username>

Very quick, clean and hassle free. We had only hours to return our moving truck and we had half a apartment to move into our unit still. Of course it wouldn't all fit in the unit we had gotten the day before, but it was the only large unit available. The nice lady not only let us transfer to a recently open larger unit with the same first month agreement, but we had the rest of the day to empty the old one. In which case we got all of our stuff out of the apartment and the unit transfered in time thanks to the operation that happens at Public Storage. Thank you Public Storage!!<//Text>

I'm pleased to be a customer of Public Storage on Hopper Avenue . I absolutely appreciate Carol. I am partial to her, in that she is a tough cookie on policy.  while inconvenient and stressful situations arise, and I needed pardon for a little rule bending or leniency, to what seemed to me ridiculously uptight, there were no exceptions. The real bottom line here is:
I know my unit is safe ,and protected against con artists, scammers, technicalities, and bitter exes. I am so grateful for Carol , who I see as a model employee, who knows the ropes and really does her job!  She protects the property, and the company bottom line! that's  a commendable set of qualities to consider when evaluating which company you are entrusting for your stored security and financial investment. Carol's commitment to guest services, is in my opinion, a mission statement well achieved!!
5 stars!! ☆☆☆☆☆< /review>

<review>Well, nobody likes to move, the day I went to Public Storage and met Carroll, she made it easier. She managed the paperwork, the tour, and the proper way to use the locks, in such a professional way that I felt I could teach someone else. From today on the Public Storage 22004 Hopper ave. Santa Rosa Ca. Will be my recommendation.</review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None</Response>< gmapID>

I would absolutely not recommend using this place for storage unless you want tp pay upwards of $75 extra a month if your late at all. Additionally, the fees keep stacking up until they are over $125 and this is only after being a couple weeks late paying the rent. What's even worse, is that they start the process of auctioning your stuff after only 3 weeks late.</Text>

"except for this money hungry business." There are quite a few tenants here who have things stored here. Because there's no other place to put the remaining items they have to their name. And right now in this time of need they can't afford to pay the overpriced rent because they have lost everything but do you think that this place gives some kind of leniency to these families who are victims who have lost everything some of them even lost their jobs..
(No way not this place it's all about the money)... hell with the people in fact it's sad how the rent all of a sudden went up a 20 extra dollars... I want you to know this has nothing to do with wonderful Carol.. this major company is all about the dollars it doesn't see anything else..< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures><user_name>Dr. C Everett Winchester< /user_name><userid>111432370311589552138< /userid>< time>

This is the ONLY storage facility you should in Santa Rosa! All storage units are the same when it comes down to it with the only exception being size. BUT, Carole is what puts this place at the top! Needing a 10x20 unit that was easily accessible from the gate, I was limited in options around the area. Carole jumped to save the day. Even though the only available unit was not accessible for a 92ft truck to come in to unload our house goods, she took the time to remember AND contact a current customer with a closer unit that was deciding whether or not to downsize her unit. The very next day, Carole called me and said I GOT YOUR UNIT. What a lifesaver. Even though I was upfront at not needing the unit for more than a month, Carole treated me as if I was just as important as a customer who needed a unit for years. THANK YOU!<//Text>

<Gmap_id>0x80843892758cbc03:0xe976cb6193cb6ce0</Gmap_id><Text>I started back in 4/29/11.  Im a commercial fisherman, and I am often on the boat for more than half of the month.  I rent with public storage because they have safe and convenient units with a very professional, knowledgeable, and friendly staff.  Carol has been the Location Manager ever since I started renting with public storage.
She has always been very Professional and courteous and often a pleasant experience each time I return each month when paying my bill.  Since I have been storing with Public Storage, I have had an overall good experience with them.  I do have to admit I can recall two occasions where If I had not spoken with Carol, and if she hadn't had such professionalism when talking to me, I would have taken my business elsewhere.   Carol is a big reason I stay with Public Storage. I feel my Items are safe and secure,  I trust her Judgment when it comes to renting to suspicious people.  She is great with customer service and is very knowledgeable with it comes to Storage units and what materials you need to properly pack and move your items safely.   When I first was looking for a unit, she made me feel comfortable by showing me how clean and secure the units are them self and told me all about my options including renters insurance.

I would recommend renting a storage unit from them.  I am very confident that you will find what your looking for and more when you come to public storage @ 914 Hopper ave in santa rosa.</Text>< UserId.>

<Time>1396377778260</Time><Rate>5</Rate><Text>As the owner of Bluetail Industreis, I wanted to give a review for Carol at public storage.  Before we rented the warehouse at Public Storage, our company was losing equipment and spending a lot of time chasing our equipment.  While working with public storage we found Carole's service both as a customer and also for the her company to be excellent.  Carole is knowledgable, helpful, and service oriented.  We appreciate her concern for us and also her concern for her company now that we've been with public storage.  We've made some adjustments in our business and no longer have need of Public Storage's service but you can count on the fact that we will absolutely refer you because of Carol.  Thanks.<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None< /response><GmapID>0x80843892758cbc03:0xe976cb6193cb6ce0</GmapID></record>

<review>Ok, so where to begin? Public Storage has been amazing!...  I am currently moving and need to be out of my place by Friday. Welllll.. today is Tuesday and my 2 bedroom apartment is still full of things (some packed others haven't even been touched) and not to mention all the cleaning I have to do to get my deposit back ughh!. Yes, I'm a procrastinator, I know 😩.. Now, while most people would panic right about now I just went online and did a reservation, which was super easy, then I went in and rented from Carole (only took like 15 min).Now I can start moving all my "must haves" into my new place and everything else in storage while I decide if I want to keep or throw away. I cannot emphasize how great public storage is. Carole and all the other employees are fantastic. Couldn't be happier.<//review>< pics>

< Review>
These owners are crooks, my stororge has raised in price approx $100, plus late fees every month, slightly more late they will CUT YOUR LOCK OFF, and fine even more, and charge a lean fee, this is the most non lenient storage I ever had, they cut my lock off 3 times all ready, we're stuck there.< /Review>

Thes folks are AWESOME! While making a rushed exit trying to beat traffic headed to the Central Valley, I forgot to lock my unit up properly or at all for that matter. The folks here caught it that same night during a property walkthrough. Using ingenuity they managed to lock my unit as i was unable to make a return trip. They followed up with phone calls and emails to inform me of the situation....I canot say enough about the service I have received.
I HIGHLY recomend these folks for your storage and property security!
Thanks again!!

Would give 0 stars if possible! They offer their services and once they get your information and install the equipment and put you on a contract they stop answering your calls and if the equipment stops working! you will never reach a person to talk to about anything. STAY AWAY! Trust me!</text>

B & D was recommended to me by someone that is a happy customer, I was hesitant but my husband convinced me.  I should have listened to what I was feeling.  I spoke to Zeno Medina 2 months ago and he told me to send him the final invoice and he would send me my check, it was all good to go.  (I have all the emails).  I never received the check so I send another email and he responded he had no invoice where he had already said it looked good and he would send check. Well I send the invoice again, Andrew answers this time and says it all looks good and he will work on the check.  I agree with other reviews....WOW it is so hard to reach someone!!!  I was on hold for almost 2 hours and still no one answered until I pressed option 1 that I was interested in there company and then boom Andrew answers immediately.  He heard it was me and quickly wanted to end our conversation by saying "oh yes I am printing it now (invoice) and will send you the check right away)"   A month later still no check.  I have 3 family members that are in need of their service, I guess I will send them elsewhere.....<//Text>< pictures>

<Text>This company is horrible to do business with. They lied from the beginning to the end. The people working for them who came door to door completely lied about the service and what they offered. When i questioned them, i kept getting the run around or no phone calls or replies. They ran my credit the next day and charged me for the service the next day. i was told since i was with Brinks, nothing would change and I Brinks would still service my account. Come to find out they lied about everything. I am still waiting on my Credit from where I was charged the next day and where I had to pay Brinks when they did not even have the equipment in my home anymore. They also lied and said they would start the process of cancelling my service with Brinks, and they didn't. I am so disgusted with this company and service and now I am duked into a service contract for the next 60 months with a Timepayment company. DO NOT EVER GET SERVICE OR SIGN UP WITH THIS COMPANY. There whole company is based on Lies. If I could give a negative response or lower than a 1 star review, I would.<//Text>< Date>

Stay away from this company! They’ve lied from the beginning and never told us they were selling to Brinks and they are the worst at trying to get a hold of. Worst decision ever. Also I came to find out one of their employees instead of getting new payment info they decide to keep the card info to use for THEMSELVES! About $500 missing from account. They kept calling saying they haven’t received the payment which didn’t understand why when the new payment info was given already. Well of course they’re not getting the payments because their employee decided to keep card info to themselves for their own use. Seriously worst company ever. Please stay away from this company.< /text>

The worst customer service I have ever experienced. I attempted to contact the technician for several months to get my cameras serviced and he did not respond. When I finally got a hold of Oz, the so called owner, he was extremely rude and unprofessional. He said they don’t handle cameras and if I need better cameras to buy more. I had to call for over two weeks to get a hold of someone. They then tell me they sold my policy, without telling me back in May. Now, they won’t let me cancel and I am paying for cameras and terrible customer service.<//text>

Fabulous system with the latest tech. They quoted me an upgrade price they stuck by the price they quoted with the features that I was interested in not the old bait-and-switch often seen in so many security companies. We Appreciate You both Gabriel beautiful installation Carlos.<//Text>

My experience with B & D security was phenomenal. I was actually approached by their representative Daniel and was really amazed on how professional he was with the whole process. My mother and I just bought our house and our credit score wasn’t all that great but Daniel was very generous and actually gave us an awesome deal. We weren’t sure at first because we did check reviews and everything but we gave it a shot. We’ve been doing business with B & D for about five months now and it has been great. We are able to control our alarm system through our cell phone when we are at work. Plus we also got my sister to switch to B & D security because her secuirty system was outdated. I was very glad that we made the switch. Thanks again!</review>

< Review>
Im going to try this again because my last post was deleted by B & D.

I obtained service without an issue. Super friendly and helpful.  I recommended their services to my family. They obtained services too.

Shortly after, my family sold their house and asked to get their services transferred to the new address. Marc, a B&D employee, installed the equipment at the new address. Then my family gets a bill for both addresses because Marc created a new account and not as a transfer. No biggie, they will fix it, Right?  NOPE!!! What a nightmare.  For almost a year the battle continues.  Threats of sending them to collections.  Harrassing phone calls for non payment on alarm at the sold house, etc.  Bill stacking up.

It gets worse. I started receiving calls from from the alarm company because my family listed me as a point of contact in case the alarm goes off. No biggie.  However, Brinks (B&D will sell your contract to Brinks w/i a year) called me, not because the alarm was sounding, they called to tell me my family is delinquent on their payment for the sold house and they were looking for them. Ummm invasion of privacy!!! BEWARE.
I called B&D, I have text messages (can prove it - not a fake post) and nothing but empty promises that this would get fixed! I called Brinks, and they refer me back to B&D. They dont care about their customers.  Best of luck if you get their services!!!  Lets see if this post gets deleted too.....< /Review>

<Text>Our equipment never worked properly. We cancelled at the end of our contract,now 4 months later and we're still being charged. Called last week and was assured we wouldn't be charged any more and that we'd get a refund,well,we were charged again today. I highly recommend people NOT to do business with B&D Security.</Text>< pictures>

Got my alarm system with this company and cameras as well. Everything was smooth and fast. The salesman came knocking on my door and told me I would receive free equipment and installisation and they did as promised. Definitely recommend!<//Text>

If we could give them a lower score, we would do it. We live in Fresno California and all was good with B and D Security until the install. The installer had no clue what he was doing, from putting the main panel up to installing the cameras. The new panel was wider than our old one and I had to chisel the molding to make it fit (he did not have the tools). Setting up the sensors was also screwed up as he put all the sensors on STAY AT HOME which included the motion and glass break sensors. We were not able to turn it on that night due to this. He also set all of the sensors to delay and that should have only been set that way for the front door. We had 4 cameras installed and instead of feeding wire inside the walls, he drilled holes straight through and we now have holes on the inside of the house with wire hanging down the wall. I have tried to get this resolved with B and D and it turns out that the installer for our area is the only installer. The girls at B and D were extremely rude. When I called Brinks to fix issues, I was told by one of their techs not to use the same installer from B and D, because he didn't know what he was doing. Beware of B and D security!!!! Beware! Beware! Beware!<//Text>

<text>Perfect ! I always thought alarm was an alarm but with new technology coming out this company offers what others didn't .. bottom line it's about service they came on time and did an amazing job ,you know when the right guy is the right guy  . My wife felt comfortable with the offer we moved forward and I recommend my family and that's not something I normally do .

<review>Stay away. Getting this company to come out to get issues resolved is impossible. They promise that someone will call you or come out within a time frame, only to have yourself waiting with no calls or no shows. Trying to get a hold of someone in the office is impossible. Calls are redirected to an automatic phone system, continuous ringing with no answer or only to be hung up on when you finally get a hold of someone. This company has no issue taking your money for installation and set up, only to be non existent when you have issues.</review>< Pics>

<review>The worst company ever to work for. The Orlando office was a complete joke. They allowed one person to disrespect the entire office with no consequences. They blamed the call center for none of the potential clients wanting their service. I don't recommend then to anyone. They don't care about a company's longevity only their wallet size. They run business credit before they even go out to the customer. Horrible. Horrible. Horrible. The sales floor manager is a complete joke. A real loser in every sense of the word.</review><rating>1</rating><Date>1509070141644</Date><user>110584225446985995077<//user><gmapID>0x80c2d24e09e9a7fb:0xb753de7bfc54390e< /gmapID><resp>{'time': 1540558402796, 'text': 'Can at us at info@mybdsecurity.com for more details so we may address this situation🙂'}<//resp><Pictures>None</Pictures><Name>Paula Smith</Name></record>

All i can say is watch out for their craigslist ad. My experience with them was less than favorable. I was hung up on during mid conversation when i asked why gentleman i was supposed to interview with was not in the office. I tried calling back and now it went directly to a recording! I gave it one star, because you have to choose at least one to be able to post. As far as customer service, they deserve an " F "< /review>

<Review>Should be ZERO stars! I will be filing a complaint with the BBB. The security system failed twice. When we notified them we requested a technition (twice) to come and audit our system to ensure it was properly functioning. No one ever showed. It's been 3 months of us trying to cancel our account and we can't get anyone to return a phone call or email. In the rare occasion I can get someone on the phone, they are rude, unhelpful, threatening and each one provides conflicting information. They deserve to be out of business!

***UPDATE***I saw their attempt to say this is a fake review. I'm a real customer and have emails and phone records to prove that we have been trying to resolve this issue for 3 months!  WORST COMPANY EVER!</Review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

I had a horrible experience  with B&D Security. They were not willing to send a tech to my home free of charge after a major incident may have been caught on camera. Instead they insisted I was trained to operate the camera which is not true nor was I trained  how to program the camera. After I called B&D Anna (b&d manger) informed me the camera  is manufactured  by a company Vonic and supplies me their number for over the phone tech help, I informed her I wasn't aware of this company and she replied we don't give this info out ...wow really a camera I paying for and the don't give that info out! So, basically still no real help. I will be cancelling my contact due to lack of customer service when it should really count...in our time of need.</Text><Date>1484763934534</Date><GmapID>0x80c2d24e09e9a7fb:0xb753de7bfc54390e</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

ALL I WANTED WAS A REFUND!!

SALES PEOPLE OVER PROMISE AND UNDER DELIVER!! THIS IS NOT THE RIGHT WAY TO DO BUSINESS B&D, MORE LIKE (BAD & DEALS). I HAD A SYSTEM INSTALLED IN MY HOUSE AND THEY DIDN'T FINISH INSTALLING IT, THEN THEY CHARGE MY ACCOUNT EVEN THOU THE SALES PERSONNEL PROMISE A NO CHARGE, AND FINALLY THE INSTALLER IT WAS SO UNPROFESSIONAL. I TRY CANCELING THIS SERVICE RIGHT AWAY THAT THEY INSTALL IT AND NOW THEY ARE SAYING THAT I STILL UNDER CONTRACT. ITS LIKE GOING TO A RESTAURANT AND WAIT 5 HRS TO BE SEATED THEN ORDERING A PLATE AND THEY BRING YOU WHAT THEY WANT AND NOW THEY ARE TRYING TO MAKE ME PAY!!! EXTREMELY POOR SERVICE!!< /Review>

<Review>If I could do a "negative" number I most certainly would.  This company along with its supervisors is and has to be the most unprofessional staff I have ever encountered.  They are simply out to take advantage of people who have no idea how there services work.  They do not care about anyone's security, we supposedly acquire their services for our loved ones protection but at the end of the day all we are doing is letting the thieves in to our homes through the main door and right into our wallets.  I will advise, if you are a person who is going to be contracting this company the following!  If you are not a person whom is very knowledgeable of how an alarm system would be most effective for your home, please do not contract their services.  They place old systems and in my unfortunate experience, they do not even furnish your home with the appropriate devices to insure the maximum security in your home.  On the contrary, what their sub contracted technicians do is convince you that you do not need any sensors where you require them.  Why?  Well in order to reduce their costs, they simply give their customers faulty service and when something is wrong with your system it takes them approximately 3-4 weeks for them to respond.  My major complaint, all in all is that they do not take responsibility for their mistakes.  B&D gave my parents a faulty device and tried to make it seem as if it was my parents fault.  This device, cost my parents unnecessary false alarms that would have been avoided if the system was working in an orderly fashion.   I attempted to contact their offices to try obtain a resolution, however their staff is completely rude, disrespectful and unprofessional.  I normally do not like to show this type of complaints out in the web, in fact this is the first one I ever make.  Why?  Because, I feel that the public should have a choice and in putting this complaint out to the public I feel that they are more likely to avoid a future headache.  I know that this company has done this before and continue to do so and people don't say or do anything about it.  I just hope they get their act together!!!<//Review>< time>

<review>ZERO STARS!!!!!!!My review is for the actual employees of B&D.This is an update to a previous review. I finally had the tech come out to install my alarm back when we moved in Dec 2015. The company installed it in May (or June) but still charged me monthly for 5 months. I spoke to a guy who is no longer with company and he explained that they would reimburse me those 5 months I went without service. I have been calling ever since and have gotten the run around. I finally spoke to the Manager and was told they would cut me a check after we had a yelling contest about this situation. She promised that the check would be sent out a month ago. I have been calling and leaving messages to check the status and have yet to get a call back from her. Oh Jesus I can't wait to get out of this contract!!!<//review>< rate>

No stars!!! This jerk (Robert) came to my door and began an interrogation about my alarm service. He all but called me a liar and insisted that I did not pay the bill and had the service terminated because I refused to allow him to install a camera and app device to my existing alarm. Hmmm...wonder how he came up with this BS?? Fool didn't know that I was neighborhood watch type, and I promptly got in my car, searched for him and began to take photographs to alert my other neighbors of his tactics. I will be posting this image on other reviews as well as with the BBB.< /Text>

<Review>Very unprofessional. I absolutely hate myself for purchasing service from this company. I regret not going with one of the major companies. The savings are not worth the worry. If I had it to do all over again, I would go with one of two companies where both company names begin with the letter "A."< /Review>< Pics>

<Review>For anyone considering going with B&D security. I highly DO NOT recommend them. If you want to buy new equipment they are very good at selling you things you don't need. I could have been done with this company. Sales rep gave me a camera and an additional three years. Later to find I still had time on a contract with their old partner- monitronics. Therefore, the sales rep should NOT have sold me new equpiment. They were in a rush to make a sale. Luckily they took the loss and paid them off. And it only took me two months to get a hold of management and the salesman.. I had to go in person three times because apparently managers weren't there when I called and would not return any of my messages...after being told they would be there at specific times. Even times I was in person still managers wouldn't speak with me.  Was also told I would get a month credit for adding another three years to my contract. Brought that up to the sales rep... Was told yes I'll contact the people and "call you" .....been few weeks from that..still no call. Still no credit. Would love to hear a response from someone about this review...least I'll know management can type at the computer.
Overall...go with a big company like ADT...you'll get better equipment and better customer service. B&D= Very poor training to their customer service/billing department people. Sales reps just want to make sales at customers expense ..Next step reporting to BBB.< /Review>< pictures>

This company runs your credit without informing you. We gave the sales rep a voided check and they never called us to state what the issue was. Never did the guy tell us they run credit. I thought companies need to get your permission before running your credit!!</Review>

This company is a rip off, your better off buying a pitbull. They used ADT sensor that were left from the old system and charge me as if it was equipment that they installed. I should've known better, a company that has to go door to door selling there services must not be very profitable or have any credibility.<//review>

Completely unproffesional outfit. Worst decision I have ever made. I would rather have hot pokers stuck in my eyeballs than to have to deal with these people. They make absolutely no sense about anything. Do not deliver. Pass the blame to others. Have not follow through. Allways the victim. Cannot express enough to potential future customers. TAKE YOUR BUSINESS ELSEWHERE. If ever I wanted a business to fail miserably, it would be this one. How they do business now has them on the right track for that outcome. I have wasted so much of my time (that I will never get back) on these morons. They need to re-evaluate the their customer service skills. Good luck to anyone who reads this and still choses to use this company. To think I still have 3 more years to deal with them hurts my soul.< /text>

<time>1423167426211</time><Rating>1</Rating><Review>If I can give this company negative (-) ratings I would.  They are the most unprofessional, uneducated, individuals I have ever dealt with.  The location manager, Maria, either needs to go back to school to learn how to deal with individuals as a professional and/or grow up.  The company ran my credit without my permission, or request for there services.  I have NEVER spoken with or dealt with these people and one day, out of the blue, I get an alert that they have ran my credit.  When I asked for a letter from Maria, as requested by Transunion to have this removed from my credit report, she simply stated: "You are going to have to wait for two weeks because I am going on vacation and will not do it before then.  In fact I shouldn't even be on the phone with you now!"  How so unprofessional and rude can someone be.  Here I am 2 months later and I have yet to receive the requested letter.  The funny part is when I advised her that Transunion required specific statements/facts in the letter she told me that they didn't need the requested information and that she had submitted information before with no problem.  When I called her on it being a "regular occurrence" she didn't know how to respond.  STAY FAR AWAY FROM THESE PEOPLE!!!  THEY ARE MODERN CROOKS WITH NO ETHICAL OR MORAL VALUES!  CONSIDER YOURSELF WARNED!!!< /Review>< pics>

<review>If you or your friends and family members are military do not use this company. I initially got their service 6 months ago. I received orders to deploy overseas 2 months ago I called them to either freeze my account or to terminate my service do to me leaving the country and not having access to their services while I am gone they denied my request and stated they do not support nor have any policies regarding military service members. I offered to provide them my military orders and a letter for my commander for the above request the lady on the phone Carmen told me that I either have to keep the contract or cancel it and pay a $3,000 penalty. Under the SCRA: Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, which protects me from any contracts that I am currently binded it in. I do not recommend this company at all they did not try to give me any other options and would not help me.< /review>< pictures>

Well today my wife called for the third time after being told there was a 200 dollar transfer/installation fee at the new house , the woman on the phone said "have a lawyer call me then" after my wife said she wanted a copy of all paperwork that we had signed . The woman said she would not and if we wanted to go further we could have a lawyer call her . Because she wasn't going to give in to our "demands".
So it's  $200 hundred to transfer , almost $500 to cancel, or get a bad report on ou4 credit . Horrible buisness practice. And even worse customer service. This place should be ashamed of themselves, door to door nonsense with the switch and bait .<//text><pics>None<//pics><resp>{'time': 1540558609556, 'text': 'Can at us at info@mybdsecurity.com for more details so we may address this situation👱\u200d♂️'}< /resp>< gmapID>

If I could give no stars I would. This is the worst company I have ever had to dealt with. Absolute horrible customer service. My mother referred me so I called and talked to Osvaldo Lerma "the owner" we talked about pricing, sensors needed, he offered two months refund to my mother and we set up an appointment for the following day. In less than an hour I received a notification that my credit was ran. Not once did the owner ask for permission to run my credit, never did he even mention a credit report check was needed. When I called him to ask if he had ran it, he said yes and that he assumed I knew since all alarm companies do it... um no.. I don't work for alarm companies, therefore I didn't know, plus it's their job to advice the customer of such thing. It is illegal to run someones credit without their permission. Well this little credit check impacted my credit report negatively. One month later, I call to ask about my mothers refund check and all they do is give me the run around, they say they will call me back and no phone calls. Finally I was supposed to talk to Maria "the supervisor" lol who is the most miserable, unhappy, unprofessional, disrespectful individual I have ever had to communicate with. I called about my mothers account but she wanted all my information on my new account, literally like W-H-A-T- I-S-Y-O-U-R-N-A-M-E I like if I'm an idiot. when I asked why, she right away got defensive and started yelling at me, I mean we were going back and forth until SHE hung up on me. I called back multiple times right away, no answer. Honestly I am paying for my services, this isn't free and this is how they treat people.. and now I have a contract and have to deal with miserable people like her...totally wrong. So sad that she probably wouldn't talk to someone like that face to face.  She deserves to be fired.</Text>

This company ran my credit the day before they came to my door to talk about the service, What kind of shady business is this!!! They ran my credit with out me authorizing it or even talking to me. I am reporting this company for doing Identity fraud! I am definitely letting all my neighbors know to be careful and not go with this Alarm company!!!

I talked to the owner Ousvaldo Lerma, all he said was to make a claim  and fix it my self through TransUnion. He was rude and hanged up on me..

Good thing I never accepted any service from this company ..

Update: I sent a letter to TransUnion along with a the complain from BBB and after a month it was erased from my credit.</text>

My experience was good until i gave them a referral and had a issue! i have been with them almost a year and it did its job. i am owed a referral bonus that i was just told i wont get unless my salesperson or his supervisor give me. i was told B &D doesnt give referral bonuses point blank and that i could only be given the supervisors email, not phone number. so disappointed in how this "circus" is run. i called to complain about being charged 50 dollars to have a cell chip changed to a better network for my area and was given every excuse under the sun about how its my fault! i was told the equipment that locked me in to a 3 year, yes thats 36 months and for me 24 to go!!!!, contract only carries a 90 day warranty. This company doesnt care about you just your money, it has taught me dont listen to the sales people who will really do whatever it takes (like not fulfilling their promises) to get you to sign up, AND IF YOU CALL THE "RETENTION DEPARTMENT" THEY WILL THREATEN YOU THAT THE CALL IS BEING RECORDED! for the record i said not one curse word, but your darn right i was mad when she accused me of messing up the equipment! Service wise monitronics has been awesome (the monitoring company) but b and d has just failed so hard its not funny.

coming from adt i can say, the deals sound too good to be true and they are! stay away from this company but do go with monitronics from someone else! dont do what i did and search monitronics and say man the reviews are great, cause b and d will take your money and laugh at you!

The moral is this company (or that employee) took my referral that promised me a check for a hundred dollars. Then told me we dont give referrals take that up with him but we do see in our system you referred him(?). all i called asking today was to have my referral turned into a $50 credit so i could get the alarm safe and reliable and i got told no! so i should pay them, while they owe me? and is it my fault they didnt test the cell coverage in my area before they installed? when you get locked in a 3 year contract is 90 days seriously the warranty on what ends up being hundreds of dollars of equipment? should sales men lie? i could of cared less about the review and wouldnt have made it if they had just helped me out and turned my referral into the credit but instead i was insulted and told its my fault. i will never do business with them again and i will never recommend them in a million years. lesson learned and it cost me so hopefully i can save people from my costly mistake!<//text>

I have to back up Steven Griego from the last post about using old sensors, I had the same experience with my home late 2015. I had a guy come to my house offering B and D security products thru Monitronix which I purchased and they also used 95 percent old sensors and motion detectors that were already installed when I bought the house. I also had a billing dispute and talked to one of the managers who was very rude and unhelpful and talked over me / yelling when I was trying to explain my situation. Can't wait till my contract is up, do not buy from here!! Ps. I am a customer for almost one year now.< /Text>

They pulled my dads credit without asking for permission! Now We have to go through the hassle of disputing it. They knocked on our door and talked for a little and now we get a notification that his credit was pulled WITHOUT his consent! Reporting to the BBB! Stay away!<//Text>

TO ALL BEWARE OF B&D. They came to my home and solicited advertising to post on my property to my wife. She explained to them she would have me contact the b&d rep"Jonathan" . I contacted him and told him we were not interested.  In turn they ran my credit without my permission and When I call their office in Norwalk their is no response. This is not A company with integrity.< /Text>

It's the worst security company ever don't trust them they just want you to sign the contract they run my credit multiple times and my information was  sold the third party and my information was stolen by some of the employees that works at B&D security  .  Don't let them inside your house or your business they are the one who's going to rob you in the end  .  Worst customer service  . stay away from this company   And complain to the district attorney   So  they can stop the scam</Text>

I went to Sherman's Deli. It's a little pricey but the food is really good so I guess it's worth it. I had a takeout order and they forgot to give me my bread. I guess that happens.<//Review>

<Review>I'm not sure about the personal that works at Desert Arc , why will they hire someone  like RUTH ??? rUth is someone who never pick up the phone and answer ,and everytime someone  lives a message in the voice mail, she never returns the calls , you may think DESERT ARC as a professional personal working in there ... but think again ,after living well over 30 messages in her voice mail she never return my call ,SHAME!!!
Dont do business  here , very irresponsible people working  at desert ark<//Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

My dad really liked that the waffle came in a little cup compared to the bag that they sometimes put the waffle in. This is the only location we know of that has the coffee drink. Super tasty especially with the salty cheese. They have covid screens with a microphone so you can still hear the server. No Indoor dining and they are attached to ranch 99.<//text>

Super extremely rude staff!! Horrible service!!! It was around 7:30pm I went into the pickup counter to pickup my waffle which was already sitting in the corner. I am pretty sure the staff saw me when I went in because she looked at me. However,  she didn't greet me or ask me do I need help. She just walked away. Several minutes later, she came back and I tried to tell her the waffle in the corner should be mine. She looked at me again, didn't say anything,  walked away again. After all the other guests were served, I got my waffle. Cold waffle...<//review>

My love for Boba Tea with Salted Cheese on top is endless.  Today, I got a free drink from this very clean place that I love to go to weekly.  For every dollar that I spent here, I got 1 point on my reboot card.  After 10 points loaded on the card, I got a free drink  :)
The staffs are very friendly and always make my order of Tea correctly.  They even suggested really good combinations of ingredients that I never tried before and it turned out to be super tasty  :)
Other Happy Lemon locations can’t beat THIS ONE!
Just try this place once and you will have a big smile on your face  :)< /text>

Super tasty, with a variety of drinks. I will say the flavor and how they are made differ from location to location, but that’s just part of the fun!

Squeaky Clean!!! I’ve been very hesitant to have any take out since SIP. This location makes me feel safe about quenching my love of boba! Also, their teas are very consistent here. Thank goodness for this location!!!< /Review>

I've had boba tea from dỉfferent places/ brands, but this Happy Lemon place is a notch above. Their tea is tasty and flavorful. The shop is roburst at time we visited in early PM.
You know it's good when the queue spills outside in winter,/spring time.< /text>

<Pictures>None< /Pictures><text>It's like every other Happy Lemon. The most popular drinks are the salted cheese ones. A layer of it goes on top of your drink. They recommend you tilt the drink 45 degrees so you don't get pure salted cheese which is salty. If you plan to go frequently, get a reboot card. For every $4 you spend, you get a point, and 10 points is a free drink. There are locations all around the Bay.</text><name>Julian Roque</name><resp>None</resp><user_id>102526432032289515233<//user_id>< time>

Great drinks, I recommend getting D5. The service here is amazing as well. If you are looking for a good place to hang out with friends or family, or even just getting a drink, this is the place.<//Review>

< Review>
Always a pleasure here. These are the true professionals. Haven't been to that side of town for a while and they sent me a 30 percent of code for the entire month. This will literally save me hundreds this month on top shelf bud. Beautiful interior stocked with even better people inside who actually engage you in conversation. I've only ever had one questionable experience here (they do a lot of free gift bags and one employee became visibly annoyed and shooed me out the store basically for weighing my options on spending more and getting a better gift bag. I've never had someone turn me away from spending more money. That was enough for me to not come back until now). I've been back a few times and thankfully he seems to have found other employment.<//Review>

<review>It was cool, good deals. Only reason I’m giving 2 stars less is because they had a promo for buy 1 alien lab disposable pen and get 1 for a 1$. I was told I was able to apply the 30%, the entire paying process took about 20 min. I waited to be told no, then yeah, then no then yeah and in the end I checked the receipt and it wasn’t applied. Basically a waste of my time.

Responding to the new message 12/9
I understand that, I was told otherwise since I was spending more than enough money on my first purchase. So like I said it was a waste of my time. It’s important to give customers a straight forward answer on deals so they can make an easy informative decision and the respect of their time.</review><user_id>103082427519084756927</user_id>< gmap_id>

<Text>Nice, clean, friendly. Phenomenal and intriguing artwork. So many products: "flowers", vapors, medibles, wax, gummies, pre-rolls. Lots of CBD:THC options. It's enjoyable every time I stop by.
I'm a one-hit wonder so I'm mostly here for medibles, tinctures or topicals for pain relief.
My partner comes for flowers & gummies and he says they know their stuff, have great product for fair price points.
And they sell "trees"! They have a cute little green house behind the front desk with potted seedlings and immature plants for sale.

The worst part is the taxes (30%) but that's business in CA and we don't have MMJ cards which are rather tough to get in my opinion.

ArtistTree more than makes up for that with weekly giveaways and discounts.< /Text>< pics>

Nothing but high praise for this marijuana dispensary and delivery in west hollywood. I don't know how you came up with the vision for high end art mixed with a weed shop but I'm telling everyone about it. Truly an experience coming in here. This is why I moved to LA.<//Review>

Out of all the dispensaries I've been to hands down The Artist Tree is the best. They just made me feel comfortable and not like I am out of place, judged, or profiled especially in West Hollywood. The staff was kind from entering the establishment, through the process of knowledge of many flowers and upon leaving. Great perks for first timers and referrals!  I am so satisfied with my purchase yesterday! Ayman assisted me and was super kind. His recommendation is exactly what he said! Creativity through the roof! lol< /review>

<text>Beautiful cannabis retail experience with high-end art on the walls and super friendly employees that are in tune with your needs and canna-curiosity.

I love walking in here because you are greeted by real live marijuana plants growing behind the check in station.

They have all the top cannabis brand products here so you can be sure to trust their quality.

The parking is a little tricky, I found some luck in the neighborhoods nearby.< /text>< date>

Tried to keep me out as I had a disability scooter. Weed I got looked nothing like the weed I saw. Kinda disappointing and they charged an excise tax almost 20.00 more  for bate and switch weed< /text>

<Review>Inconsistent prices.
Why offer discounts on your website or WeedMaps if you’re not going to honor it when you come to pick it up?!?

Absolutely atrocious business.
Manager tried to give me the run around, and jack up the price of the product.

When you reserve online, you get price tag... "estimated", the manager claimed.  Well, another price was TEXTED to me... it differed from this "estimated" cost at reservation. FURTHERMORE, the price differed ONCE AGAIN on the IN-STORE receipt... nevermind what the manager tried to pull on me next:

She claimed that the EXCISE TAX was not included in the final cost... well, it WAS, and included ON THE RECEIPT!! Excise tax is usually included in the price of the product. Here, it is individualized on the receipt, but the manager just did not seem to care, and wanted to charge me nearly $30 more dollars. I think it threw her off that I had a 20% off discount from WeedMaps, but she just couldn't understand that. (The State and Federal Taxes were also individualized on the receipt).

My partner has been a loyal customer here, and has the same complaint that it's always inconsistent. Of course, when I try to be a patron, I'm basically slapped in the face. Well, we're sick of it.

I walked out without my product. There's equal and better product elsewhere for more honorable prices. This place (AND , their sister-site "The Green Easy") have lost us and our friends as loyal customers.

I really wanted to like this place because it’s conveniently located and they have a good selection, but man... their customer service is lacking, and their employees are not informed.

Disappointed.< /Review>< Time>

Absolutely the cleanest and most well appointed pot shop in La. Run more like an Apple store crossed with a Starbucks. Consultants are very knowledgeable and not pushy or salesy. Great overall experience here, just note cash or debit cards only!< /text>

<Text>The Artist Tree is a pretty solid adult-use/medical cannabis dispensary.  The layout is pretty cool because it's focused on giving shoppers great selection as well as art from local artists.  That alone gives them extra points.

They have a cultivation cube that is the focal point of the store where you can see a bunch of cannabis plants in their pre-bud form which is super cool.

The employees there were all very nice and the gentleman that I spoke with was very knowledgeable on almost all of the products.  For the products that he wasn't personally familiar with, he let me know what he's heard.</Text><pictures>None</pictures></record>

The artist tree is truly amazing. I've never been to a dispensary like this. The walls are filled with beautiful art from local artists. The staff is very friendly and informed. They have so much product and variety you are sure to find exactly what you want and find some new product to try as well. I highly recommend and I can't wait to go back. It really is one of a kind<//review>

This is one of the best herbology stores Ive ever been to. It's an beautiful place. Great concept. Huge selection, like probably the biggest I've seen. Ultra premium flower for a good price. I highly recommend this place.< /Review>

<text>A really cool elevated stoner-shopping experience, All art on walls is awesome AND for sale (I think) which is so fun. The service is always impeccable, whether it be for pickup or walk-in and, for a new-ish shop, I find the prices to be pretty fair considering the competitive product lines they carry. Also (last thing) for Mother’s Day they had AMAZING Gifts with purchase and they gave all women a rose!🥺a really nice touch and honestly caused this review...< /text><Resp>{'time': 1589300762900, 'text': 'Thanks so much for the kind words!

This place is awesome! You can actually pick up and browse products like a normal store. No more only being able to view things from behind the counter. Plus, they have a HUGE inventory, new things I didn't even know existed. Super fun to explore for both veteran and new cannabis users. Just let the staff know what you want, and they'll point you in the right direction. Definitely recommend checking it out!</review>

This dispensary is amazing! You must check it out. Their selection is out of this world and it’s the largest one I’ve been to. But besides how great the selection is and how amazing the layout is, the employees know what they’re talking about, are very helpful and friendly.

This place says it all in the name! If you are looking for cannabis and love art this is the shop for you. They have an awesome display of art from local artists, you can even buy some of the pieces. I work for Mammoth Distribution so I am here often and it's always a fun visit. If you're looking for vapes they carry Heavy Hitters' high potency line, RAD's flavorful carts, Farm's amazing live resin products, AND Surplus which is quality vape for a low cost. There is literally something for everyone!<//text>

<Text>WARNING: DO NOT ORDER HERE FOR 420

Terrible customer service experience before the driver even left the store with my order.

10:04 am order placed, order eta 11-12pm

10:07 am texted to make sure the order went through
(No reply)
12:07 pm finally got fed up with no response and decide                to call

When I called, I had a chance to talk to two different ladies. First one told me that my driver has been out that my order should be getting here soon.

Then I get a call from exact same number I'm talking to and another lady was calling me about my text i sent two hours ago. (11-12pm eta and calls 12:07 to reply to my text i sent two hours ago)

This is how I talked to two ladies, and second one was now telling me driver hasn't even left out of the store. I was frustrated due to late response and confusion but Its 420 so I told them to please hurry as soon as possible.

Girl: ok! Im so sorry about that we will make sure your order is out as priority

Waited another hour, called for the 3 rd time. Guess what the 3rd girl told me. Driver has just left 10 minutes ago and its because i was using credit card.

First of all if it was cc problem they could've simply told me when I first called and I wouldn't have minded. But still as Im writing this I haven't received my order.

ORDERED AT 10:04AM

Terrible communications between employees, getting lied to twice saying my order would be here at this time and getting added 1+ hour on top of eta TWICE. The audacity to tell someone that you had to wait 3 hours for to sort thru because of using credit card even tho they advertise it on their website.

UPDATE 3:02

Driver is near by the house and tells me the reason the order took so long its because he forgot his card machine and so he pushed my order was supposed to delivered at 12 pm until now. He told me if I can go withdraw cash because he doesn't have the machine. Or I had to wait another hour.

Finally fed up I reached the owner

Owners excuse was that they have 2 drivers and the whole covid situation has limited their speed.

I get it, but I called 7 times talked to so many people, could've easily prevented this whole situation by explaining to customer nicely

But when I told him about what driver said he said I could either cancel it or wait to get my order after making a customer wait from their own mistakes for 5 hours.

Im not sure how its logical for store owner to blame their situation in covid yet the driver had the audacity to tell me to go withdraw money. Why did I order in first place if I had to go to bank?

I really tried reasoning, being nice, understanding but this is by far worse delivery experience I had in LA.</Text>< Pictures>

Was checked in. They took my ID and then I was told they were closed. Now. It was 9:55pm by this time. Yes. They do close at 10pm. I think they were afraid of me so they just kicked me out. Won’t be going back.</Review>

<review>Pro: they stay open later than the other gyms but it's always crowded. They should stay open 24 hours like the one one Reseda since they're busy at all times.

Con: weekend hours close early.

People working out without mask.

Hardly anyone cleans anything after using it meaning I have to clean it twice.

I seldomly see a cleaning person. I've seen one and she is never really doing anything. You would think they would have staff in the gym room cleaning after those who don't wipe instead of having 3-4 people sitting in the front talking.<//review><response>None</response><UserId.>115242602941088210516< /UserId.><pictures>None< /pictures><GmapID>0x80c2892f3c878413:0x9597be1f7d77cc45< /GmapID>< Date>

<Text>I have a restraining order against a member who had stalked me at my previous gym, where I was employed. My husband and I were not able to use the gym (as members) because the stalker came at the only times our schedules allowed. The manager had no interest in honoring the restraining order (or even LOOKING at it), INCLUDING when we came to get a refund. They said they’re not “required” to. Incredibly disappointing to see a complete disregard for the safety of the female members (myself included) and staff, seeing as the man is a repeat offender.

If there are any female staff or members that get harassed or stalked by said member, I hope they file a joint lawsuit against this company, since they have been notified of the possibility and take no action. Any company that only caters to safety when it is required, is questionable AT BEST. And shame on corporate IF they backed the manager, Tony Amayo (not sure if I spelled it right since he wore no name tag), as he claims they did. Very poor professional conduct, especially in this social climate.</Text>< Pics>

<text>If I could add zero stars, I would. Back in June of this year, I attempted to cancel my membership due to concerns of COVID. I went on the Crunch Fitness website and sent a request to freeze/cancel my membership to the Santa Clarita email. A few months later, I noticed that I was still being charged for my membership, and I was also being charged late fees for no apparent reason. I came in in August to discuss this discrepancy, only to be nonchalantly dealt with by one of the managers, who really treated it as if it was some kind of joke. When I cancelled the membership, I was charged a $20 cancellation fee, although I was charged two or three days before for my membership. I highly highly recommend not going to this gym, even if they are one of the few gyms with outdoor equipment available in Santa Clarita. Just wait for 24 Hour Fitness to open up again or do bodyweight exercises, anything to save your money and avoid this gym.<//text>< rate>

Just received a threat text message saying that my information will be sent to collections. My account has been closed since April last year because of covid.
Just like Andrew I was also being charged until l contacted my bank. The. Manager there is useless and doesn't want to return anybody's money or deal any of it<//Review>

I drive from Stevenson Ranch to this gym and I get told if I don’t have a towel I can’t come in CDC rules. Yet that’s not what the website or flyers on the door state. So I was forced to leave and come back rep. was rule and unprofessional. And follow CDC guide lines please because no cleaning materials are available to clean the machines!!

Angela AWESOME trainer!  Company are THIEVES.  LONG STORY but thievery happened to 3 people I know & to me.  Should you sign up for training, HIGHLY RECOMMEND you mention you're ONLY signing up for which ever level you choose x one month, if that's what you want.  For example $600 for 12 sessions.  Otherwise they will charge your bank acct each & every month.  They never verbally inform you or point out when signing electronic pad that contract is a monthly agreement.  When you finally realize this to be the case, they make it SOOO DIFFICULT to refund your bank acct.  One of my friends was NOT refunded $450 for 1 month.  If this happens to you, talk to your bank.  Different banks have different policies, but they will help.  You'll be grateful for their help.< /text>

I loved working out at this gym. There was staff constantly wiping down machines, all the equipment is brand new and there's an IHOP right outside for my gains!!< /text>

< Review>
They gym is  nice and maintained it's almost always empty I'm guessing due to the lack of business. The staff is unhelpful always talking amongst them selves. don't bother asking any one any questions they will just direct you to go online . I've managed pretty big gyms during my carrier and behaviors and culture like this would be unacceptable. If some one has questions about classes (I don't know maybe you should try to sale them a package . After all that's your job if everything was done online I don't think the sales position would be around for long )  I also see that most of the positive reviews are based on the training staff that's because most of the time trainers are individual contractors and have to put their best effort to keep their clients happy .< /Review>

I signed up for one month of Personal training with someone that is no longer there.  Said person (Boris) did not tell me I would be charged monthly until I cancelled.  I was charged a second month for $250.  If you call over the phone the staff is clueless.  There are very unprofessional and rude.  I went in on 3/4/19 and Sergio who is no longer there was rude and unpleasant to deal with.  He supposedly reversed my $250 charge and cancelled the month to month I never signed up for.  He did apologize for Boris not disclosing the month to month.  He assured me I would be refunded $250 in 7-10 days.  Here we are 4/2 and still no refund.  I patiently waited til 3/26 and Davis said he would take care of it and call me back the same day to resolve the issue.  Never heard from him...very unprofessional.  On 3/28, I was there again and asked Davis about the status of my return.  He never did anything and then and there just pawned me over to some lady.  I was so upset I didn't even get her name. At this point I felt like I've been given the run around.  The only thing she did was make a copy of my refund receipt from 3/4 along with my cancellation receipt, and license.  She told me I would get a refund in 7-10 days. I wrote this review today because I just got a $49 maintenance fee charge.  Maintenance charge?...they never even have soap or paper towels in the bathroom!! I will be calling corporate about my refund.  At this point I will be canceling my membership.<//Text>

Clean. Nice staff. Good options, I love the functional area for those who don’t have the UFC membership. Love the space as well. Can’t beat the price for those not needing any guidance. Recommend this to anyone. It also has showers (clean) and nice lockers. Temperature of gym is perfect as well. Music could be better but not bad.<//review>

< Review>
I had a bit of a rocky start at this gym with weird billing issues (I kept getting charged late fees when I was making my payments on time) but they were able to clear the charges and I haven’t had any issues for the last few months so I’m assuming I won’t have that problem again. The gym itself is nice, there’s a large variety of working gym equipment to use and they even have Olympic plates which is great. I came from 24 where half the machines were always broken and all they had were cracked and chipped bumper plates, so this is a definite upgrade. It’s never so busy that you can’t get a good workout in, but I wish they had a couple more deadlift platforms and squat racks to work with. I never do personal training sessions and it sounds like that’s where a majority of their issues come from, so if you’re not about that then you should be okay.< /Review>

<Response>None</Response><Rating>1<//Rating><review>DO NOT join this gym. It is the WORST in Santa Clarita. The worst service I have ever received and not even worth $10/month. I was a member for less than a year and the issues started from day one! And if you do join DO NOT trust the employees with your kids in the kids care. They have the worst music playing so loud that you can't even hear your own headphones! They lock the free weights room unless there is a class which means I can't even do that. No sauna and the machines are not great.
My issues began when I first wanted to use child care and the employee was on their phone. Didn't even notice I was trying to drop off my son. After literally standing there for a minute, I walked away. I then requested to cancel kids care because who can trust anyone to watch their child when they don't even notice a full grown adult in the doorway. I continued to be billed for another 4-5 months. The GM at the time (Jabarai) kept promising time after time to cancel it and give me a full refund. Then he disappeared, never having resolved my issue.
Months went by that I could no longer use the gym now that I don't have child care. And still no resolution to my refund so I finally decided to cancel my membership. Nightmare ALL over AGAIN. I emailed the GM at Crunch and he redirected me to another email. I then sent my request to them and received an automatic response stating that I should hear back within 3-5 business day. TWO full weeks later and NOTHING. So I reached out to the GM who only apologized for the inconvenience and didn't do anything from there.
I finally decided to give my honest review on Facebook.  I received a response from customer service to PM them and so I did and they said they reached out to the SCV branch to fix my issues. The new GM (Daniel) now reaches out. He says since now there's an email thread about me trying to cancel, that he can do it from his end. Still unsure why he couldn't do that after I had mentioned that no one had responded to my request. Long story short, he promised to fix my issues (my refund included though he would have to go through corporate) and he would give me 6 months free gym membership and free child care but also asked if maybe that'll get me to take down my negative review on FB. I thought "great" he's going to get things done and I told him I would think about it. Emailed him to let him know "hey let's get that refund finalized and go from there (clean slate)." I never got an email back so I finally called today where he all of a sudden found my email.
Then he backtracks and says well if I give you the refund then I can't give you the 6 months which completely defeats the purpose of "making it up to me" all he is doing is keeping my money and finally using it for kids care that I still feel uneasy about! I told him how it felt like he was saying "take it or leave it" and he says "I'm sorry you feel that way."
I'm sorry but NEVER going back. I'll be joining another gym in SCV and taking my friends with me. I already had a friend cancel her membership. And a second one has also decided to post her negative experiences at Crunch Fitness.<//review><gmapID>0x80c2892f3c878413:0x9597be1f7d77cc45< /gmapID><username>Deborah Turcios< /username>< Pics>

they won’t let me cancel my account, and they never told me that it was a year contract. Basically they scam you into signing up and then sap your money for a whole year regardless of whether or not you use it. And if you try to cancel, they will make you pay out the rest of the year’s monthly fees. Which means there’s no point to canceling it because one way or another, your money is theirs. I called and talked to different people, all of which said different things. No one is on the same page and I recommend you choose a different gym. I don’t even have the energy to describe to you the hoops they have made me jump through. Other gyms may be a little more expensive, but it’s worth it to actually get the customer service and honesty.< /text>

Absolute worst gym to go to!!!! From the comments it appears that they are running a personal training scam.  I was assigned to a personal trainer that left 3 weeks into my training sessions. Then I was assigned to someone else but I was unable to meet with them because of child care. I asked the manager if he would credit me $180 of the PT i purchased towards child care. Jabari , said he would grant it as long as I email him. I sent him an email and I never heard back from him. I sent him a follow up email and nothing. I've called SEVERAL times trying to get a hold of him but in the three months that I've been trying to get a hold of him he is always  "touring" or " in a meeting. This is just one encounter I had with them . The only time they have provided medicore customer service was when I forked out almost $500 to sign up with this inconsistent gym . Worst gym to be a part of.</Review>

On April 4, 2019, I signed up for personal training with Davis, the personal training manager at the Santa Clarita CRUNCH FITNESS for a package of 8 sessions which also included 2 additional sessions for free.  The cost was $480.00.  Unlike a standard business contract, there was NO paperwork just Davis indicating for me to sign on the electronic signage pad for my training package.  NEVER ONCE did he mention there would be a monthly recurring charge of $480.00.  Of course I signed because I was purchasing my 8 + 2 training sessions and I wanted to pay for them.  WHY would I question that?  Any legitimate and ethical business would advise you that you were actually signing a monthly recurring contract.  Again NOT ONCE was ANYTHING mentioned about being charged monthly for additional training sessions.

On May 6, 2019 a company named ABC FINANCIAL took $480.00 out of my account and again on June 4, 2019 took another $480.00.   A TOTAL of $960.00 was taken from my account that I NEVER AUTHORIZED.

While under the impression that I was ONLY paying for my 8 + 2 sessions, I did sign their electronic signage pad.  Though, because of their misleading, dishonest and corrupt business practices, in reality I was UNKNOWINGLY signing a contact that was allowing them to charge me monthly for sessions that I never intended to have.

I went into CRUNCH FITNESS and spoke to Jabari Day, the club manager on June 10, 2019 regarding the unauthorized charges  He then completed a “Request For Refund” form and informed me that I would be refunded the $960.00 in 7-10 business days.

I did receive a check dated June 27, 2019 for $480.00.  I immediately contacted Jabari Day inquiring about the remaining $480.00 still owed to me, and he said he would look into it.  After two weeks of multiple phone calls and emails to Jabari Day, all of which were ignored,  I started sending letters to the founders of CRUNCH FITNESS, Curtis and David Harman. I also spoke to Nic Soszynski, the Business Customer Service, Creative Coordinator.  After all of this, I was informed they are not going to refund the additional $480.00.  Their willingness to refund half of what is owed to me implies they recognize that they were guilty of poor business ethics.

I personally know of others that have been deceived by CRUNCH FITNESS in the same manner as I have been.  After researching I’ve found online what seemed to be a never ending list of complaints of the deceitful and shady business practices of CRUNCH FITNESS stealing money from members.<//text>

<Text>Please steer clear from here.  They are liars and don't uphold to what they tell you. They have a new general manager because apparently the other one didn't perform well.  Well now they have someone new that can't either.  No one has the authority to do anything.  I called them the day my bank returned their attempt to take money out. The lady that answered the phone said she didn't see anything yet. I offered to come in and pay. She said it wouldn't help because they already attempted to take money to wait a few days when it clears and to come back and pay it. And its exactly what I did. And was told that the late fee will be waived. I now checked my bank and ontop of my monthly fee they charged me a late fee and stated they can't reverse it. The new general manager was unwilling to help or even care instead he was being coindesecding and didn't care that he was losing my business, there are so many other gyms in this area, I regret coming to this one. Plus their hours are inconvenient .< /Text>< Pics>

<Time>1551769735872</Time><Rating>1<//Rating><Text>I would love to give this gym 5 starts, as my husband loves this place and has a UFC membership for more than 2 years. So my husband open a Crunch trial for me to try the gym on February 24 but he was told the Crunch would not start until February 27. We went yesterday to try the new Crunch, and I was told my trial expired on February 27. I was surprised and confused as I had no clue that the pass was already activated and had expired the first day the new gym just opens?! Anyway the staff was very sweet and showed me around, and explained that the classes are starting only the next day as they just opened the gym. And on top of that she reactivate my trial for 15 days for me to try the classes!!! I got very excited. All sounds so promising for me to stick with this gym! Today, first day of clases and I’m there to try it. Yay! Unfortunately, my trial is expired again!!! I am very disappointed and ask to talk to the manager. After explaining the situation to the manager, his name is Sergio, instead of a warm helping customer service personnel who suppose to help you and make the situation better, I’ve got only throwing balls at me as it’s my fault that my trial expired. I am shocked that Sergio is a manager!!! I had an amazing experience yesterday with a simple employee, who is way above this manager in customer service. Just be nice and fix the problem. Does it matter if I’m more wrong or more right than you? Why keep pushing? He gave me 4 more days to try the classes. What about the 15 days that I was given/promised yesterday? The whole today’s experience get me so frustrated. I came home crying and told my husband he is not going to this gym anymore! This gym would rather loose 2 members... so disappointing 👎</Text>< Pics>

I regret not keeping my membership at 24 hour fitness. Crunch made big promises to get me to sign up. They close early and it's almost impossible to get in contact with the owner. This is a franchise branch and headquarters dosent care what these people do. I'd skip this place and run to 24 hour fitness instead.</Text>

<date>1621453659444< /date><Rating>5< /Rating><Text>I have to say I was a little hesitant when we got transferred to this hospital after reading the reviews. My  daughter got treated for Appendicitis. The pediatrics section is AMAZING! All the nurses are nice, attentive and made me and my daughter feel comfortable! Everyone came and introduced themselves and always kept us updated in what was happening with her. The surgeon checked my daughter and I loved that even though she is 9, he spoke directly to  her asking her  questions. I don’t remember all the nurses’s names but I really want to give a big shout out to them, they are amazing and my daughter loved them, they made her feel special enough that she wants to come back!! ( we are going to try to avoid hospitals 😂) I cannot speak for the rest of the hospital but pediatrics rocks!  They took care of my daughter, my baby my everything and for that I am forever grateful!< /Text>< pics>

I went to the emergency room due to a reaction to a pain medication (I had oral surgery the previous morning). I had severe abdominal pain, felt faint, was going in and out of consciousness, could not walk or stand, had blurry vision, cold sweats and was entirely weak. Still, the male receptionist had the nerve to tell me and my boyfriend that we came at a bad time and that it’s busy. It was 1 am, and I DID NOT CHOOSE to have a reaction to said medication. In addition to this, I was placed in a wheelchair in a corner of the hospital ALONE for an hour and a half before ANYONE checked on me. I remember thinking I was going to pass away. When I was finally “treated”, the nurses were very rough and treated me like a pincushion. Lastly, I witnessed the same male receptionist from earlier making various inappropriate and sexual remarks to a female nurse all while I was raising my hand to get some assistance since my face was so swollen I could barely speak. The ER staff did NOT take their job serious that night, and I am absolutely disgusted at how I was treated.<//text>

<Review>If I could give this 0 stars I would have. I was there for over 4 hours, in pain, with an iv needle in my arm, no help. Couldn't even get a bed. It was cold, and they didn't provide anything to keep me warm. I had to discharge myself because they were taking so long. I called before I even went there to find out what was wrong with me, and all they could say was they were going to give me meds, which was dumb because all I have been doing is taking medication, and nothing is getting rid of the pain, and I don't even know what is causing the pain which is the main reason I went there, and it was a complete waste of time because I have to go to another hospital to find out. I definitely don't recommend. Don't go there unless you want to be there for hours without help.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>{'time': 1619550719465, 'text': 'On behalf of California Hospital, I would like to extend our sincere apology for not meeting your expectations during your hospital visit.

<Text>Nice and clean hospital, very friendly staffs especially Mrs. Winnie at Pediatric department.

P/S: some drawings on the walls at Pediatric department. They have play room for kids with lots of toys. The department also have 🚿 room for parents to use in case of need.
Parking fee $7/ max if you park inside the parking lot, valid parking $10. However, if you can find the spot on the street then 30' for a quarter, less expensive if you don't stay long for a day< /Text>< pics>

It's all right there in the name...DIGNITY !!!
This is how you'll be treated by these HEROES!!
I recently spent two days in the care of these amazing people who treated me with respect, compassion and most importantly DIGNITY something that makes this old man feel like his life matters. From the moment I walked in to the moment I walked out i was shown all the respect that can be shared with another person, I even expressed to several of them that the care they showed me was if I were their own Grandparent. I felt so pampered that I even suggested renting a room HAHAHA HAHAHA 😅 😆<//text>

< review>
Arrived at Ca Hospital on 01/10/21, my Phizer vaccine. Upon entering, Signs led me to the correct line. Temp was taken via standing electronic device. I was led into a room where there was a short line that moved quickly. Information was asked and documented. I was directed to a seating area where my wait time was short. I was called up for a vaccine and it was quick and painless. I was asked to sit in a designated area for minutes, to be be sure I did not have a post problem. After 10 min I was on my way home. My documentation informed me to return on 2/10.<//review>

This review is not about the care provided (we didn't make it past the lobby). It is about Tara, the security guard. My friend was having a psychotic episode and spent hours going back and forth between deciding if she would voluntarily admit herself for evaluation (she didn't but that's a different story). On one of the darkest days of my life, Tara was a light that kept me going. She made sure that we were hydrated and taken care of while my friend (and myself) were both struggling immensely with the situation. She used kind words, patience and care while talking with my friend & I. It made what was probably the worst days of my life just a little better. Thank you, Tara.< /text>

<Text>I am so glad too had my arm surgery at the Dignity Hospital in Los Ángeles. California.
The special service stars right at the entrance, the gentleman of information all the front desk, the Latin guy was so helpful and very well  educated when it comes with patients, he is the face of the hospital.
The staff is very well trained and professionals in their areas.
The surgery was excellent. They treated me as a baby. Love this hospital , I think is the best hospital of the city in, Los Ángeles.
Thank you very much. Every body take care and a great happy holidays!<//Text>< pics>

Amy at the ED express was a cool nurse!
Came in around 1am , got attended too
She was informative on medicine , what exactly she was putting through my iv.
Very knowledgeable on her craft!
Told me what the doctored ordered :)
Great Job on hiring AMY , she deserves some recognition.
The PA was also very compassionate & checked me out and asked me where pain was!!<//Review>

Did not bill my insurance correctly it appears ... all of the hospital bills except one were correctly billed. I didn't receive any billing-related mail from them after my visit. Then I get a notice from a debt collector over a year later and a major derogatory mark on my credit report. I suggest everyone go elsewhere!< /Text>

<text>Love this hospital!! I've been admitted here a few times and the care and the staff are always so caring. The nurses are SUPERSTARS & will make every effort to make sure your pain is minimum and your comfort is maximum. No request is too difficult for them:
Need more pillows? Done.
Want another sandwich or apple juice? They'll get it for you!

The doctors explain thoroughly and answer all of your questions; you are part of your healthcare team. And if you still have questions when you get home you can call them for assistance.

<text>I was really impressed by the care I was given at the hospital when I visited today for the first time. The warm welcome by the front desk Mr.Muiruri to the very professional staff who attended to me till I was discharged was very impressive. All of the staff I interacted with  were so warm and helpful. As I recover, I wish abundant blessings to all who dedicate themselves selflessly to the service of humankind. I am very thankful.

I had doubts about this hospital because of all the negative reviews . But from the moment I stepped foot in there , before the surgery , during surgery and after surgery everyone was so kind and made you very comfortable . RN nurse Jill was the best as well as RN nurse Erica ! Together they worked amazing . They were so awesome when it came to helping me out. They are kind and should deserve more praise ! Over all this is the best hospital and Dr. Thomas cachur did an amazing job on my surgery . I would highly recommend this hospital . It’s not about how the outside of the hospital looks but how the people working in there are . Like the old saying says “don’t judge a book by its cover “ !< /Text>

<review>I was referred to California Hospital by my nephrologist for a rhenal biopsy. My nurse was Yolanda of Radiology and she was AWESOME! Full of energy and instantly, I was at ease. I was informed that I will be sedated and would not feel everything, however, that was not the case. I don't know if the medication was lately administered coz I felt everything and I was awake. Anyhow, my nurse, Yolanda was very nice and helpful. She made my experience a lot better.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>{'time': 1605544422041, 'text': "Thank you Diane for letting us know about your experience with our care team.

<username>naomi negash</username><Rate>1< /Rate><review>I don’t know where I can leave feedback about the experience trying to get an appointment so I’ll leave it here. long story short I had an appointment for 11/06/20 that was crucial therefore had to call out of work for. I arrived at the hospital early to beat traffic to a 2:00 appointment. and 45 min before my appointment I got a call from radiology, from Shelly cancelling my appointment because there was an issue with my insurance, something about me having two and one was terminated and the office needed a letter of termination from that insurance company so they can bill medi-cal for my procedure. Shelly tried to get that and told me she couldn’t today because United, the insurance company she needed to contact system was down. I couldn’t believe it, I needed my app bad and I asked if I could have it anyway and have this issue resolved after and she said Patty in admin who calls the insurance companies and sorts things out wouldn’t allow that. I asked for her number to see if I could call the insurance company for her and help resolve any issue in hopes to still have this appointment. Patty seemed nice, but I had no idea she didn’t know why she was doing and was going to ruin/waste the rest of my day. She gave me the number of United insurance and told me to call and see if they will send me that document so I could possibly keep this appointment. I called the insurance company didn’t know what I was talking about, I merged her in so she could hear it herself and she just gives me another number from United to call. I call them again explain what I need again, same thing they said I’ve never had insurance from them they can’t help me, I merged her in and she’s hears it for herself and by this time it’s 3 pm and I missed my appointment but I’m still trying to have this issue resolved so I can reschedule. Patty then tells me to call my doctor and ask them to remove United from my list of past insurances since I’ve never been with them. My doctors office told me they faxed her everything they have this morning and don’t know why she can’t let me have my appointment and they can’t do what she’s asking. I call her back and am told by someone else she left for the day at 3, I give him my info hoping maybe he can help and to my disappointment he said he would have let me have my appointment and fixed this issue later he didn’t know why patty did what she did or what she needed from me. He told me what patty is asking me to do might require calling medi-cal or even meeting with a social worker! Very frustrated and saddened by my wasted day I give up and decide to call Monday morning and ask for a manager. She fixed everything and booked me an appointment in 10 min. Was never able to tell me what the issue was on Friday that wasted my day and messed with my mental health and pay check, but I told her what happened, told her what patty put me through on Friday and she just apologized and said she would follow up with her. I’m baffled, BAFFLED by Pattys lack of knowledge and carelessness to waste my time, money, and give me a stressful run around when all she had to do is ask her manager for help if she didn’t know what she was doing. I know for a fact if anyone else was “helping” me but her I would have had my original appointment and wouldn’t have had such and awful day and headache. Please train this woman. I’m leaving this review on Yelp and google as well this should never happen to anyone else again, hope I never have to come back to California hospital.</review></record>

From walking into the door the security guard was extremely rude you would think sick people would get treated better i absolutely not, proceeded to the window it’s bad that there’s a clear screen add mask and mumbled words the customer service was extremely horrible. No one use sanitizer besides the nurses and the pre check point. And the discharge nurse the whole experience was horrible honestly.< /text>

I had never been to this Hospital before, but I was referred here from my ENT doctor for a biopsy. I was just there yesterday morning, the nurse and ultrasound tech in the radiology department were so nice to me and took such great care of me. It really helped me calm my nerves especially when you're scared of the procedure. The doctor himself wasn't very chatty but very professional and explained the procedure to me well so that I would understand what was going to happen.The nurse and tech stayed with me after until I felt well enough to get dressed and head home and also held my hand during the procedure I was very nervous and the lidocaine injection was a little painful.  So thoughtful and caring I can't believe I forgot their names but it slips your mind when you have anxiety. I'm glad I had the procedure done here.

It is a little messy looking downstairs but there is construction and I'm sure new covid regulations that made the hospital look a little more hectic than it would usually be normally.< /Text>

<Review>Hello, my disagreement is that the person, I think, was the person in charge of the paper entry help office, she did not use a mask, she had it on the desk while the other people used it, she did not and she was very worried about my safety, the guys who were there  They presented everything very safe, but that was not the bad thing until she left the office, the lady used it while I believe that it was not useful for all the health that there was, it is the first time that I see this especially in a hospital it does not give very  nice picture, thanks for your attention< /Review>< pics>

This place was awful. We came in at 1:30 a.m. Someone broke the exit sign as he stormed out and eight people gathered to talk about the sign and tried to fix it. But as they walked back and patients asked for water or an update they all said they would have to ask the doctor. Which only two doctors were working. Two! In an ER in downtown LA!

We weren’t seen until 4:30am. By then the symptoms decreased and when we tried to explain the doctor said well I can’t say or treat the symptoms because I didn’t see them. They misdiagnosed my sister and after talking to two nurses who said she wasn’t given a prescription they finally found the doctor’s note.

We finally left at 6 am.

The most thorough part of the process was running the insurance at the end of the visit. Will never ever go again.</Text>

<review>I know that a bunch of people don't like going to hospitals but I used to come to this hospital as a kid, I was born in California in that hospital and went there for 10 years until I moved to Chicago. I'm now 14 but I hope to come back to this hospital when I come back to California. It has such a great service, they took really good care of me when I was in a really sick position. Honestly, this hospital deserves all the love, it's a wonderful hospital< /review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

< Review>
My first time in this place and I was disappointed I was visiting a family member and they treated them awful .... the staff are rude half of them didn’t know what was going on. Now I’ve been sent here for my Covid testing and surgery and this is a terrible experience half the staff seem to still not know what’s going on completely they always seem clueless and rude the process of coming in just for pre-op Covid testing is a complete mess I’m honestly terrified to have my surgery here for the staff seems to have a total lack of care and concern for there patients. I would not recommend anyone coming here being treated here the place looks disgusting always smells terrible it’s as if it’s only meant for skid row patients<//Review>

I had severe anxiety being that this is my second child and my first being 12 years old.  I was in severe panic mode. Surgery was smooth and quick , thank god & the staff my baby was brought into this world healthy and in perfect condition. everyone very efficient and caring. After delivery I spend 3 Days hospitalized in which with the nurses assistance I was able to start walking and eating. Every one was  very compassionate about my fears which I really appreciate. If I was to deliver again definitely I would choose California Hospital again. Thank you California Hospital!!!<//review></record>

Checked in at the emergency room to visit my cousin at 7:24pm. I am typing this at 10:20pm and can no longer wait. I was told someone will walk me in so I can see my cousin and how he is doing. Unfortunately it never happened as I had to leave already home for bed rest. Would not recommend anyone to come here if the waiting period permits this much time for anyone coming in. I also observed families coming in and some were told to stay behind in the waiting area. People who came in were sleeping and were practically making themselves comfortable for long periods of waiting with blankets. Is this normal? Review posted at 10:30pm.</text>

<time>1573401027314<//time><Review>This is not the hospital my husband would have chosen for his emergency open heart valve replacement surgery, but we were pleasantly surprised by the high level of care we received.  My husband was attending a convention at the LA Live JW Marriott and ambulance took him here.  To our horror transporting him to another hospital was not an option.  The neighborhood and emergency entrance gives you the wrong impression.  The furniture in waiting area at the ICU and the public bathrooms throughout the hospital need to be cleaned better, unacceptable cleanness standard.  The staff of physicians and nursing skills were excellent, especially ICU nurse care.  My husband spent 2 weeks as a patient and we are so grateful for the exceptional care.  Dr. Randal F. Roberts performed the surgery, Dr. Jonathan Gordon, Dr. Simon Mates, and NR Elena Rossman were invaluable care givers, post surgery. I am proud to live in a country that has this level of care in an area that I would not have expected.<//Review><Gmap_id>0x80c2c7c6717ed233:0x4e727d5c4cf1a595</Gmap_id><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOurZHrsLdmHrzpZueStu2fnZ1IPeZKjobZH1u0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics></record></dataset><record>

Had the greatest experience at dignity health California hospital I normally don't post anything for business but I just had to let people know how good the staff is there the nurses the doctors are all very professional and very courteous and kind and give you their uninvited attention in regards to any questions you have the facility is clean and  Fresh  and if you're not sick go eat in the cafeteria  have their breakfast their omelets are fantastic the cafeterias clean and everything is fresh and remodeled this will be  my 1st choice in a hospital that I would go to if I was feeling sick or had to be hospitalized it would be at dignity health California hospital

I gave birth on October of 2018 & it was literally the worst experience ever. I will never go back again! Most of the nurses (not all but MOST) were rude, mean & uncaring. My anesthesiologist was so ridiculously rude, she sort of ruined my birthing experience. The birth clerk & the charge nurse was also rude & pushy as hell. Giving birth is supposed to be a pleasant experience, you guys should be ashamed of yourselves tainting a moment we will never get back! On another note, my sons NICU nurses were amazing & so was the doctor that delivered my son! Thank you guys for taking care of me & my baby.<//Text>

Lacks the dignity part the medical field excuses their demeanor and actions with lies and simple misdirection a system built on cost and validation of skills through further wealth how many less surgeries does a greedy doctor do because he can charge more and save less to make it to the island for the weekend politicians priests and now doctors</text>

The Staff are Great.  I'm in my FEELINGs about this experience. It's a staff LIKE a well Done ballet in their emergency room, moving and out-  checking vitals, giving medicines, screenings,. And still finding a bed etc. They did that so the way to the 6thh floor. My2¢<//review>

I do NOT recommend this hospital to anyone who has the choice. Staff do not care about you and only want to take the money they can get from your insurance. They hire someone to reply to the bad reviews to act like they care but they're only doing that to look good.

I'm a case manager for permanent supportive housing and our clients are often sent to this hospital because it's right across the street from one of our apartments. I always had a good experience in person but over the phone it is completely different. Staff on the phone are always  rude, sounded like they were tired of their jobs and was not willing to help. Having that attitude discourages individuals from getting services, especially those who cannot speak for themselves. The hospital serves a low income, poverty stricken community, whom often cannot speak for themselves and are easily manipulated. This hospital comes off as for- profit because they hire individuals who do not care to provide good service. Disappointing.
A client was admitted here and was sent to a hospice after getting discharged. We did not know where she was at for about 4 days. Every day I called the hospital and they directed me to their insurance, who did not know where she was at either. I even came in person but was only given phone numbers that did not work.
I had such a horrible experience with Cesar from case management. It took an exasperated conversation to have him finally give me an address for our client's hospice location . Why did it have to take that much energy just to get information on someone? I am her case manager who is genuinely trying to help her and provide her the support she needs. Cesar was rude, passive aggressive, and provided an unpleasant experience.  If I had the choice to not have this as the main hospital for my clients, i would switch them somewhere else because I do not feel this hospital cares for my low-income, mentally ill clients, who deserve the same treatment as everyone else.<//Text>

No one explained my plan of care   Never actually met the cardiologist responsible for my care.  None of my symptoms improved over the 4 days I have been here.  No plan to change current situation.  Terrible room accommodations.</text>

I don't understand where the positive reviews come from here .  the only people less competent than the nurses are the doctors, who ignore the patient and stop by briefly on some days if they feel like it, and dispense bizarre and dangerous orders without rationale or speaking to the patient at all.  The specialists are worse, and the place is not very clean.  If you care about your health, avoid this place.
With further stays, I have had worse experiences.  Rude nurses, doctors who care nothing for individual patients, arbitrary rules that harm patients, leadership staff that give misleading information.  It is a struggle to get decent care here, and there is no good reason for it to be so.  The constant lies and deceit from doctors are absolutely shocking.
The hospital is full of arbitrary rules that have nothing at all to do with medical science; if you show up with
The person who responded below told me she is unable to do anything except repeat what is said to her, to the doctor in question.  Good luck getting decent care here, maybe if they happen to like you or you don't really need any help.  Ive spoken to her multiple times, im not clear on what the "patient experience and quality team" is actually able to do beside repeat what I say to my doctors.  I would prefer to just talk to my doctors and be heard for a change, rather than have to repeat things endlessly.
Some of the areas of the hospital are clean and decent, or would be if it where not for all the people working there.  some of the nurses are pretty nice too, its just the luck of the draw at California Hospital.< /Text>

I don't know whether it's a good or not so Good idea to review a Hospital for what it implies in itself,  but I was admitted to the Ca. Hospital for a very acute gallbladder pain that knocked me out for 7 days. I was about to get it removed but they couldn't because it was very swollen,  after the 7th day I got discharged and eventually I chose to treat the gallstones with alternative medicine and it worked for I still have my gallbladder and it is clean now. The nurses are very attentive and always available for your needs, I can only be grateful for their care , specially Shany on the 7th floor whose beautiful smile gave hope every morning In the midst of my pain.  Blessings...👊😁👌</Text>

<Text>Wife went in a 8:30 PM. They didn’t get to her until 5 hrs later after losing her test results and couldn’t find a doc to read the xrays. I was not able to be her because it was to “crowded”. They gave her an IV for no reason and requested a pregnancy test for no reason. They didn’t ask her what medication she was on just sat her down at the check in until she got a room where they didn’t get back to her for another hour and a half.<//Text>< Pics>

My granddaughter had emergency abdominal surgery yesterday morning.  I live in Salinas, CA which is over 400 miles away. I received a call from the nurse in ICU. Also spoke with Dr. Mates, who did the surgery. He explained  the procedure, her condition, and the type of help she was to make her get better. I was very impressed with his kindness and compassion. The nurses in ICU are very kind and caring.</text>

I wouldn't recommend this ER if you really need urgent help. I was waiting for more than four hours, just to se a doctor for 2mins and hear that I just have infection. With all my symptoms ir was obvious. When I ask doctor what kind of infection, she doesn't know as it could be any. And it is after I did blood tests.
Evidentualy they handed me the bill of almost $1000 including the fact I do have a really good insurance and this amount is only my 15% co-payment. What I recieved? Two blood tests, 1 urine test and 2 pills and almost five hours of waiting to get some medication.</Text>

I was here visiting a family member after an accident and have to say it was one of the more helpful and pleasant hospitals I've been to. The staff was very friendly and attentive.

The level of care I witnessed was great, which made me so much more comfortable about having a family member stay here overnight alone. The nurses were wonderful and kept all of our spirits up. Thank you.< /review>

Terrible hospital. First of all, all the employees don't even greet you when you say hello. They just stare at you and keep walking. 1 out of 10 will probably respond back. Second most of the nurses are all together most of time with each patient at a time or not doing anything but talking to one another just walking by in the hallway. You are just waiting there for a while for a nurse to come in and help you. They don't really care about their patients. And third most of the "doctors" and the people who do surgeries are Beginners/ Entry Level! You have to be very careful if you do come into this hospital and try to avoid all those beginners/Entry level people that are learning and don't know how to do things good. Best thing to do is to avoid this hospital! I've seen quite a few people who are suffering pretty bad from some idiot beginners that do surgery on them. Now I know why this hospital has a bunch of bad reviews!<//text>

Security Guard at the ER is Rude. The doctors that i had was great doctors the nurses were great that i had. But the hospital its self is very rude and not have commendations when a single parent comes in for help and they have their child with them and they have no other family members to watch the child that they will not let the child stay in a room when the parent had to be admitted to the hospital the child was old enough that she didn't need to be taken care of I really hate this hospital and I'll never go back again but the nurses and the doctors fought for me but the hospital were jerks< /review>

If I could give this place zero stars, I would. I went here seeking medical care after I was robbed and assaulted. The specific service I was seeking was not available at this place and I was asked to wait to see a social worker who would refer me to a medical provider who could assist me with the very specific service I was seeking. I waited along with my sister to be called. I spoke with a nurse who directed me to move to a different waiting area. I waited some more. After nearly two hours waiting, I was finally called, my vitals signs were taken and I was informed my discharge papers would be ready soon. Huh? Accord to these people, they had paged me repeatedly and I never answered. My guess is that the nurse who directed me to wait at the other waiting room never informed or made a note to anyone that I had been asked to switch to a different location. Anyway, by this point, I was really upset and ready to leave and seek medical treatment elsewhere. The straw that broke the camel's back is the attitude of one of the nurses in particular who treated me like I was stupid and showed absolutely no empathy for my very delicate situation. If you enjoy being patronized, ignored, and being treated overall like you're insignificant, by all means go to this place. It's obvious they lack proper communication skills and their social skills are sub par.

UPDATE:

As of February 2020, I was billed almost 500 for a urine sample, and a blood sample for which I never received results or even know why they were taken. I also had my vital signs taken. At the time I received the bill, I only had about a week to make a payment. I didn't pay it since I didn't have the sum at hand and thought, I'll just pay when they send me the next reminder. Low and behold, I received the bill again and was dumbfounded to see that the amount due jumped to $1,413.30!!!!!!!!! That's right ladies and gentlemen, one grand for a urine sample, a blood sample and vitals. I almost feel like they should be paying ME for having made me waste my time. Ridiculous. I will contact the business manager who replied to my earlier review and see if they really are in the best disposition to be of assistance. I will update you all with honesty so you can make your own decision about whether you want to do business in a place like this or run for the hills--- I wish I had. The greed of the medical field is without bounds.

UPDATE 3/12/20: Called the number listed above--- and either they have lots of complaints or are otherwise "busy", as I have yet to hear from anyone. Also, the two bills referenced in the earlier update are TWO separate bills---- one for being in the emergency room (no mention of the services supposedly rendered), and a separate one for the medical attention I supposedly received from an MD and an NP (since when do MDs/NPs take vital signs and urine/blood samples? This is news to me, I only thought nurses or nurse assistants performed these functions. So either I'm being billed for services that never actually occurred or this great hospital is so innovative that its MDs and NPs are probably changing diapers and providing bedpans for ill patients). I called billing services and requested an ITEMIZED copy of the bills--- I also requested that the bills be audited to ensure that as an uninsured patient I am NOT being charged higher prices than insured patients---- which appears to be a normal practice in medical centers, so watch out if you're uninsured! I will update this review in the near future to inform anyone interested about how things are unfolding. I also plan to contact the BBB and if need by, the City Attorney.< /review>

<text>Good health care and the food is actually pretty good too. I came  here because my doctor does his surgery here. Although it is in the heart of downtown Los Angeles once you get past the front doors it's the equivalent of any high-end good Hospital. If you're going to stay for more than a couple of nights try to get a room with its own shower. Housekeeping does not seem to keep the communal ones up very well, other than that it was a fine five nights day.<//text><time>1503955665282< /time><resp>None</resp>< pics>

Worst ER in DTLA. You end up waiting here for hours until you see a doctor. Even LAC+USC is more efficient. Doctor didn’t even physically exam me and only relied on blood work to tell me I was OK after severe stomach pain.</Review>

I gave birth here. Overall I had a wonderful experience. Nurses were kind and helpful and there when you needed them. I’m giving 4 stars though because I came in around 4 with contractions and everyone got called before me because It didn’t seem like it was serious since I was able to talk and laugh. When I finally got in an exam room around 6:30 I was checked and was 5 cm. No one can back to check on me for another 45 minutes and I had to push the call button to find out I was ready to go and my doctor wasn’t called yet. But after that it was wonderful.
They just need to actually be more mindful about people checking in. Everyone handles pain differently.</text>

This place doesn't deserve to be called a hospital. We've been waiting since 7am (it's now 3pm) for a 45 minute procedure.
8 hours and we're not in a surgery room yet.
Doctor is Hayward Eubanks. This guy is a joke. Who gave him a license to practice???<//Text>

Shorter version- unprofessional, insensitive and rude staff. Except for Matt. The communication between staff to patient very poor. The staff appear to be annoyed and bothered when you ask for assistance. If you're overwhelmed dealing with patients and their health, find another line of work. The hospital staff must do better! -ER Department May 26, 2019 7:27 a.m.<//Review>

If I could give negative stars I would. The ambulance took my mom here after a car crash.

Lowlights include:
• The CT tech who was a vocal anti-vaxer. What you believe on your own time is your personal business, but being vocal about unsubstantiated beliefs, that endanger public health, in a public facing health role is unacceptable.
• Overall dirty conditions.
• Seemingly well meaning, but careless nurses who continued to touch my mothers fracture while “helping” her get up.
• The lack of communication between the care team. Everyone who saw my mom had no context on her condition (was there no chart or team meeting??).
• The 10+ hour wait for my mom to see the neurologist (after the 7 we spent in the ER). During that time no one informed us that she wasn’t supposed to walk around because they were worried about possible fractures in her spine. The nurses saw me walk her to the bathroom and walked her there themselves on multiple occasions.
• The over two hour wait time for discharge after my mom was cleared to leave the hospital.

Highlight:
• The doctors were good. Her ER doctor seemed especially great.

Overall this hospital has some serious operational and staff issues that are not conducive for good care. If you have a choice DO NOT choose California Hospital.<//Text>

DONT COME TO THIS HOSPITAL ESPECIALLY IF YOU NEED URGENT MEDICAL ATTENTION.  I came into the hospital in excruciating stomach pain and begged the doctors and nurses to help me.  I begged and screamed for help and the staff just stared at me and one guy even laughed at me for yelling for help...I was clearly in agony but staff didn’t give me any kind of care until two hours later.  I thought I was going to die due to their neglect.  After two and a half hours of waiting in a bed a nurse comes to see me and it takes him about 30 minutes to hook me up to an IV.  He got blood from the IV needle all over my bed sheets and didn’t replace them.  They didn’t treat my pain even after I told them SEVERAL times I have a history of Crohn’s/Ulcerative Colitis.  No one wanted to help me. I couldn’t see a specialist for my condition.  After waiting a few more hours for blood work results there was still no form of treatment for my pain. Doctor came in and spoke to me for less than a minute and interrupted me in the middle of explaining my medical history and walked away without any kind of advice or help.  Once they were ready to discharge me they FINALLY gave something to help with nausea.  My medical needs were neglected and I left without any kind of medication. Please don’t come here I’ve seen hospitals in third world countries better than Dignity< /text>

👍All staff are dependable, courteous/ kind, & listen to you. 🤷‍♂️Facilities inside are kind of grungy but whatever. You're not there for an Ikea convention. 👍Grounds are really well kept/pretty. 👍Service has always been useful and efficient. 👉 My only gripe is the parking costs, the ER doesn't have full range of testing for things like pathogens on site, and medical records aren't accessible on the weekend.< /Review>

<Review>DO NOT go to the ER here unless you a bleeding out. Otherwise they will not see you for a LONG time. It is better to drive an hour outside of the city and find an urgent care there.

I made the mistake of coming here. I hit my head and needed steroids within 7 hours of arriving, else I would have become deaf in my right ear. (I have a rare hearing disability). They didn't see me until 9 hours after arriving, and I am now deaf in my right ear. So take it from me, if you can wait the extra hour, or even 30-45 minutes, go somewhere else.<//Review>< name>

I came for a c-section and the doctor's where amazing... Very friendly... The nurses in recovery where awesome as well... The only thing I don't like was the fact that they wanted me to leave after being here for a day in a half... They must be crazy I had just had a baby and tied my tubes... Don't I need a few days...<//Text>

<date>1446649180263<//date><Text>I love this hospital. My loved ones were taken care of here with a very compassionate nursing staff. One of the Radiology exams (CT Scan) was delayed but the staff did their absolute best to take care of my aunt during the delay. Sure there are bad apples (especially nurses) at every hospital but the they are only a few and far in between (like the one that did not answer my aunt's call light). I found out that this particular nurse was from a staffing agency and here for only one night. I feel that one bad nurse does not represent all of their nursing staff.  My aunt received great care here. I would definitely recommend this hospital.< /Text>< pictures>

Visited the ER on Friday 12th April. My right ear a piece of cotton swab was stuck. My husband tried to take it out went in further. That didnt work. Reading what they said online I was like, let me get the stepping. This never happened to me and I have always been so careful. Anyway fastforward arrived after 4pm. Filled out a sheet with personal info.  Took pressure and weight. Asked the reason why my visit stated it. I asked what would be done,  said they may have to flush my ear out. Told me to sit and wait. A nurse came to get me, mentioned they were calling my name, probably the name was mispronounced. Shw took me on the other side. I didnt hear my name as prior to that I asked when i will be attended to.   Everyone was helpful, the place is clean. Nurse ushered me into a room. Dr. Waltz came in she was very welcoming. Checked my ears said its deep. Told me to lie down, put on the overhead light in less than 2 seconds it was out. No pain. I was so grateful. She put me at ease.  After I left the room went to Paul to finish registration. Very helpful. Ensure you have your ID and insurance. Left around 7pm. Am sure I would have left earlier if I heard my name which I was listening for. Am staying away from qtip..</text>

<Text>I give this hospital a 3 rating star the hospital most nurses and workers don’t care about their patients also they take a long time to come answer you. I had surgery and was two days in the hospital. Not the best of all hospitals. But I want to make in clear in the 7th floor were I had my surgery there was this person a nurse named Austin who is just great and amazing in taking care of their patients. He is one of the outstanding nurses I had ever had. Hope he gets to see this review one day. But overall is an okay hospital. Just some people need to step up thier game. Thanks Austin for everything. The 5 stars goes toward this person and amazing nurse.< /Text>< Time>

<review>Service there could have been better. My grandbabies where born that passed away this passed week. Some of the nurses where not cut for the job. You can tell who is there for the patients and who is there for the money. I seen compassion with some of the others in the labor and delivery side. They are very compassionate and one shed tears with us. The others gave me hugs. I would not personally want to end up at this hospital.</review><Gmap_id>0x80c2c7c6717ed233:0x4e727d5c4cf1a595<//Gmap_id><pics>None<//pics><time>1522816419541</time></record></dataset><record>

<userid>107444248326979902322<//userid><Text>They should call it "Digustingly health" cause there's no "Dignity" in the service!!! I've never been so disgusted  in a hospital in my life, & I had my baby boy here, but just like many, this isn't my first horrid incident encounter with this awful place. First of all, let's talk about the dirty, filthy, unsanitized, unprepared, rooms. Then, let's talk about the lazy, unprofessional, low bottom, poorly skilled, crunch box degree nurses, who lack absolutely everything related to nursing!! My 4cm dilated pregnant daughter went to the ER  4/16 with legs & feet swollen to the size of elephant feet. Not only did they improperly check & diagnose her before sending her home, she caught pink eye from the hospital room & was told "sorry, we're understaffed & needed to have at least 20 rooms that needed cleaning". They never emptied the trash, the tools used to the her blood pressure & vitals were on the floor, things that belonged in the bio bags were exposed in the regular trash, etc; just disgusting!!! Never going to this hospital again, & if U value your health, & life U won't either!!!!!! If I could shut them down I would do whatever process to make that happen, & the majority of the nurses, & doctors there like Dr. Steinberg, & Dr. Cachur are drug addicts themselves!!!!</Text><Date>1555711530746< /Date>< Name>

<Review>some of the nurses and doctors are decent good people but as for the rest of the bunch they participate in group stalking innocent victims such as aiding hate groups to bully and ridicule an individual that has been targeted. it may be manipulation to make the employees think that i am criminal that hasnt been caught yet to cause the employees here become hypervigilent against me and other victims of organized harassment.</Review>< pics>

I’ve shared your comments with our staff and we wish you a future of good health!"}</Response><text>Visited the ER on Friday 12th April. My right ear a piece of cotton swab was stuck. My husband tried to take it out went in further. That didnt work. Reading what they said online I was like, let me get the stepping. This never happened to me and I have always been so careful. Anyway fastforward arrived after 4pm. Filled out a sheet with personal info.  Took pressure and weight. Asked the reason why my visit stated it. I asked what would be done,  said they may have to flush my ear out. Told me to sit and wait. A nurse came to get me, mentioned they were calling my name, probably the name was mispronounced. Shw took me on the other side. I didnt hear my name as prior to that I asked when i will be attended to.   Everyone was helpful, the place is clean. Nurse ushered me into a room. Dr. Waltz came in she was very welcoming. Checked my ears said its deep. Told me to lie down, put on the overhead light in less than 2 seconds it was out. No pain. I was so grateful. She put me at ease.  After I left the room went to Paul to finish registration. Very helpful. Ensure you have your ID and insurance. Left around 7pm. Am sure I would have left earlier if I heard my name which I was listening for. Am staying away from qtip..< /text><Name>Cassie E</Name>< userid>

<review>This hospital has got to be one or the most filthiest hospitals and ER I've ever seen in all my life it is worst than Harbor General. And mind you I'm a native New Yorker and I've seen my share of hospital horrors but let me tell you California Hospital is the worst of the worst.
I had a surgery done here on January 4,2019 performed by Dr. Hinika and Dr. Alex Kim and I had to return to the ER 3 times since then due to surgical complications in which my wound has opened, become infected, and I've been in excruciating pain.
I've been re-admitted 3 times and finally thanks to one good doctor Dr. Shabundazah has put me on wound vac therapy with home health aide to assist me with the wound dressing and machine operation. Aside from the good Dr. Shabundazah and 2or 3 nurses that genuinly care for the sick, unfortunately other doctors I've countered are horrible human beings such as Dr. Alex Kim, Dr. Amoei. If you have no other choice but to go to California Hospital, please be aware of the doctors I named who are clearly there just for a paycheck and do not care about low income medi-cal patients. Oh, and last but not least, just try and get services from the social workers there one is named Nancy, and the other has glasses and curly hair if you need help or referals they will just tell you to call 211. Horrible, hospital and staff.</review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

<rate>1< /rate><text>I hope I can give zero. This hospital is a shame to LA. Poor nurses attitude, they would get u to do every test and do any u don't wanna but they wanna. All are for money. They will not recommend any other specialist until u charged for many useless tests. If u don't wanna sign the paper, they would sign your signature by themselves. I can't believe this hell is located in LA in CA. Trust me, they are robber, there are so many nice hospitals. Never go this hell.< /text>< pics>

I lifted heavy item and got a pain under my stomach, so I went to emergency. Everything was good, especially nurse Kim was very friendly, understandably and attentive she checked my body part with pain issue she checked my tool and balls to be sure there is everything as should be.
Except waiting time after first contact with the nurses it was good experience for me.<//Text>

I had my baby here 6 months ago and they didnt have enough staff at the time I was ready to deliver. My doctor was so upset because no one seemed to know when I reached 10 cm to start pushing. They give you a cheap car seat. Look around different hospitals its a very special moment and you decerve the best!!<//text>

This is the worst hospital ever!!!  My brother got hit by a bus and was taken to California Hospital.  The hospital mixed my brother up with somebody else and while he was in surgery, the nurse came out to ask if his name was William.  REALLY!  Registration called me and demanded that I take his ID and medical card.  They messed up and they still had the nerve to be jerks about it.  I spent an hour trying to fix it.  The person fixing it had to call the Trauma Rooms and informed them that the person they had on the operating table isn't who they think they are.  I asked to speak to Manager and they said she would call me in the morning.  That was a week ago.. I'm still waiting.

My brother had to get all 5 toes amputated on his left foot and every time we asked the nurses about how many toes were amputated, they always gave us a different answer.  One nurse said 2 or 3, another said 3 or 4 and finally another nurse said All 5 toes.  How do they not know this information if they are the ones taking care of him.  One nurse even gave my sister attitude when she asked and the nurse responded "The nurses here don't know anything".  She went on being rude and told my sister that she hasn't seen his foot nor has she changed his dressing.  My sister demanded to speak to the surgeon.  Most of the nurses there are super rude.  One of the nurses even left my brother in the bathroom and didn't want to help him.

I advise you not to go to this hospital unless you really need to...</Text>

<Review>Not sure if this place is a hospital or a prison. I suffer from anorexia and I was admitted for fainting due to a mix of not eating, not sleeping and alcohol. I know I was partly to blame but the treatment I received was horrible. I woke up with my arms and legs strapped to the bed. None of the nurses would tell me where I was, what had happened or call my mom or anyone for that matter. Even though I was sober and conscious, they refused to untie me or allow me to call anyone until morning. I made them aware that I suffer from anorexia and they responded by giving me something to make me throw up. When I was finally allowed out the next morning, they had lost MY PASSPORT and my $400 hair extensions. I waited an hour while they looked and eventually they said they would mail it to me. They called me a week later saying it was there and here I am now, half an hour after arriving still waiting for them to find it. DO NOT come to this prison. You'll get treated like dirt.< /Review>< pics>

<review>Labor and delivery department was more like a horror story than an empowering experience. If you plan to do a natural birth or use a doula this hospital is against it. They treated me like a crazy person for doing natural positions in labor, then kept bringing up epidural over n over to discourage me, lastly they gave my doula a hard time coming in. Nurses and doctors in the labor room are rude and they jab I.V. and catheter into your body painfully. Now the most I will say is the post partum room was different better service etc.< /review>< user>

12 hours of pain....no one even paid attention for the first 2 1/2 hours. Had to ask for another ambulance to take me another facility before they decided to send me for x-rays.  After finding a dislocated elbow with a radial head fracture they still couldn't get the splint correct and it became dislocated again the next day.  No pain meds, no assistance with disability release....nothing! Dr. Gregor McIver, thanks but no thanks.  To the other residents there who stood around in the center of the madness and held conversations on their personal life, you do not belong in the profession.</review>

My dad was brought here after an accident at work. He stayed in the ICU here for about 3 days, the nurses discovered he had Leukemia as soon as he arrived here. They took very good care of him and attended to his needs as soon as he needs anything, They answered all our questions and were quick to find the best doctors to treat him. After the 3 days here he got transferred to Good Samaritan hospital where they also took very good care of him and tried everything's they could to save his life. Unfortunately his body couldn't take much more and it began shutting down due to how fast the leukemia was acting and how much blood he lost and 3 weeks later he passed away. I would like to thank the nurses here for the support they gave our family, especially my dad in those 3 days he stayed here. I know he's very grateful that we all fought til the very end with him.</review>

Re: the staff of the hospital — get some basic manners!  I stood in the cafeteria line this morning behind a handicapped person assisted by her daughter.  A group of employees in scrubs stepped in front of everyone and started barking orders at the line person and planted themselves in front of those who were waiting our turn in line.  Disgusting display of rudeness, especially in a hospital!</Review>

<text>Do Not Go to This Hospital!! The Worst Hospital And Worst Service!!
1st of all, there is absolutely No parking. So when you're trying to get to the ER, this makes it extremely difficult. After about 35 minutes of luckily finding a place to park 3 blocks away at 2 am, when you FINALLY get to the ER, you have to go threw a metal detector and the "security guard" harrassess you got 5 minutes to see if you really need to be there.
It took over 8 hours for them to see my husband and release him for simple gallstones. All they did was give him a prescription and send him on his way. After 8 hours?? This is the absolute worst hospital and I will never ever return here, even if it was the last hospital on earth.< /text></record>

The Worst Medical Service in my life!!
I had exicision of mass of my left breast surgery..
I arrive at 8 am to the hospital, which they prepared me right away for the surgery which was until 3pm!!
I was sitting all the time in a chair!..I did not have the service of bed until before the surgery..
When performing the procedure of the radicalizacion they transported me to the other building by wheelchairs in the street.... they left me in a hallway for more than 40min to be able to perform the procedure..which was around 11:30am..(lunch time)....The people who performed the radicalizacion were so hungry that they did not wait for the anesteshia to take effect and they proceeded to install the wires in my left breast... it was the most painful experience!!! They took me back to the hallway for more than 30min...waitting for someone to take me to the other building again in a wheelchair down the street... For a moment the Gentlemen turned the wheelchair because the blanket got stuck with the wheels of the chair!!
They left me in a room since 1:30pm until 3pm with out bed service!!!...
This is the Worst Medical service!!!!<//review>

I see this hospital hasn't changed. I have a son who is 26 years old who was born at this hospital. My doctor was great but the nurses were the rudest, most unprofessional nurses I have ever encountered.< /Text>

In fact, when asked for the full document, you are greeted by an angry accounting bozo who will refuse to show you WHAT you are signing.

Amazing...  and of course, my insurance was billed for the very same labs I asked for, but they refused to administer.  UN-FREAKING-BELIEVABLE.< /text><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

But over all the  ER doctors were very professional, polite the x ray technicians very polite as well ,,

I did not had any dignity at this place to see my sister. They want to electronically record your ID. I did not allow this thus I was prevented to see my sister. No other hospital that I been to does this practice. It runs like a prison. I would tell anyone who I talk to to never do business with this hospital. It is a disgrace!< /Review>

<date>1530131804703</date><Rate>1<//Rate><Text>UPDATE: after receiving absolutely NO HELP THE HOSPITAL BILLED ME $1900 for them taking my vitals..

FIRST IF YOUR DOCTOR IS RYAN DEVIVO ASK FOR ANOTHER ONE! The hospital room he put me in was dirty and it smells horrible, bathroom looks disgusting (not the public restroom but the one you give urinalysis) my doctor was HORRIBLE and had a nasty attitude. i waited in my room for TWO HOURS before my roommate questioned if a nurse or doctor was ever going to see me. finally (PAC F Ryan DeVivo) came to check on me he was extremely RUDE and basically told me he couldn’t help me. need i say i came to the hospital because i have had a headache for the last 6 days, i passed out in a grocery store and i have been throwing up on top of feeling dizzy whenever i stand up. after explaining everything to my doctor he literally looks me in my eyes and says “i don’t know what’s wrong we can hook you up to an IV and a ibprophen and see if that helps. they never checked my vitals NOTHING! how does a doctor put his entire life in debt for a medical degree just to only offer a patient who is VISIBLY in pain!! After being there for 2 hours with no help i ask for my discharge papers he said yes in a nasty way. i asked for his name he refused to give it to me and said “it will be on your discharge papers” i asked is there a reason you can’t tell me it? Ryan then replies “would like for me to spell it out” i said “no because i can sense you ignorance and sarcasm” Ryan then asked me why i was going to a different hospital and i told him it was because i had been there for 2 hours and no one helped me.. in fact my urinalysis was STILL sitting in the cup on the counter when i asked for my discharge papers! Horrible horrible horrible doctor and reminded me why i don’t come to hospitals. 👎🏾👎🏾</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

<rating>1</rating><pics>None<//pics><Date>1517069384379<//Date><text>Dr. Heilpern, who was the head of Emergency Services, is a sexual harasser. I am a medical doctor, and I worked for him at California Medical Center and at La Palma Intercommunity Hospital in the emergency departments. One day in the emergency department at California Medical Center he tore open the front-buttoned dress of one of the female clerks, exposing her panties to the entire emergency department. She was horrified, screamed, and tried to pull her dress back together to cover her panties. She turned bright red and kept saying to me over and over again, "He is so inappropriate! He is os inappropriate!" She was so distressed that she had to leave her work station in the middle of a busy emergency department. She sued Heilpern, and I was promptly called by his attorney and asked what had happened. Thereafter Heilpern gave me a raise and a lot of other benefits, I believe, in an attempt to keep me from telling the truth about the sexual assault. He settled the lawsuit shortly thereafter.

James Yoshioka was the CEO of both hospitals and was aware of Heilpern's incidents of sexual harassment.

That year Heilpern paid for our emergency department Holiday party, which we had at my home in Brentwood. At the party, I was bending over an ice chest to get a cold drink for a guest, when Dr. Heilpern came up behind me, placed his crotch against my buttocks, grabbed my hips with his hands, and began to pretend to perform a*** intercourse on me, laughing the entire time as all of my guests looked on mortified, including my significant other. I felt humiliated, and went downstairs and locked myself in my bedroom for the duration of my party.

After settling the lawsuit with the female clerk, Heilpern repeatedly tried to fire me, but always backed off because I had the support of my fellow doctors, and because I asked James Yoshioka, the CEO of both hospitals to prevent Heilpern from firing me in retaliation. On one occasion Yoshioka confided in me that, "You have really been sh** upon." In January of 1994, I lost my brother to a violent and traumatic injury. I informed Heilpern that I had to go home for the funeral, and that I needed a few days off. One hour before I went to the church for my brother's funeral, I was phoned at my parents' home by a colleague who informed that Heilpern had fired me.

I sued Heilpern for sexual harassment and wrongful termination, and Yoshioka and both hospitals for failing to intervene to stop the abuses, and we went to a jury trial. The judge refused to allow my significant other to testify about the sexual assault and battery against me at the Holiday party. Heilpern's attorney used the defense that I was an independent contractor, as opposed to an employee, and therefore the employment sexual harassment laws did not apply to me, despite the fact that the IRS had reclassified me as an employee.  The jury felt that, based on this defense, that they were unable to award me anything. We interviewed the jury after their verdict, and they all said they believed me and wanted to award me damages, but they were unable to do so because of the independent contractor defense.< /text></record>

<Rate>4< /Rate><Review>The one time I spent at this hospital I was actually surprised at the quality of treatment and care I recieved.  I was 7 months pregnant and had been the victim of a hit and run accident.  The staff, particularly the nurses who care for me and my unborn child were friendly, knowledgable, and caring.  I spent a full week there and despite having never known of the hospital prior to that time my visit to the emergency and OB departments was pleasant and I was thankful.</Review>< pics>

<Text>Absolutely, hands down, the worst medical treatment i have ever received. I'm a nurse, I'm well aware of what should be done for a kidney infection. None of it was. Not sure if my Dr. was an actual dr. or what, but this hospital was a joke. AVOID. Go to UCLA.< /Text>< time>

Nurses at the ER department are awesome. Basically everyone ive never had a bad experience with the actual staff. There was nurse who was rude to call patients crazy. I brushed her off when she basically kicked out my children and I from the chairs because my child was crying because she was sick shes a toddler. I dont hold it against the hospital or the Er staff but once she called out patients with mental disorders crazy infront of the whole ER that was just the most horrible thing I've seen here.

There's this security guard after all the times ive been there ive never had witness something so disgusting. He's a Hispanic older 40's dark complex. He goes on to asking every female "oh why are you here?" "Are you pregnant ? " "here you can have them check you and make sure they give you all the treatment its free" okay so who are you to ask people why they are here? Why are you dicussing other patients. No we dont need to be harassed by someone who is not qualified to ask these questions.

This was the first time anywhere I've seen a security guard be this nosey. Everyone at the Er department is great they try to take care of everyone with great respect and protect their privacy. I appreciate that. But their security guard made not just me but other females uncomfortable.

The lady calling patients crazy was unprofessional and so was this security guard. Those have been the two times in one visit that I encountered not so professional employees.

Dont let this steer you away. The er department is great. The fastest er I've been to.< /Review>

<Review>I was transferred here from st Francis medical. Worst decision ever made by my insurance. I've been in pain and thirsty since I have gotten here to the 7th floor nurse Celina says that she has no supervisor that she is in charge. I can not get hold of my doctor Razi. It clearly says lead nurse is ms Ahhy now where to be found. Real bad service they cannot give me my antibiotics or my fluids. Yet they have the paper work that my Doctor from St Fracis gave them< /Review><name>Jose Cazares</name>< gmap_id>

This is the worst hospital to go too!!! My grandma got kicked out! They didn't give her her medication, they didn't fix the transportation for her dyalisis, and didn't look for a nursing home for her. We had to do the nurse's jobs and the case managers job!! Also they dismissed us without a permission of leave! They are horrible!! Most of the nurses were rude and inconsiderate. Just two out of all the nurses my grandma had were actually doing their job!! They just made fools of us. We were confident in the nurses and doctors, but now we know that we can't trust the hospital!!! They had already made several mistakes and injured my grandmother before as well, her injury from the nurses was so bad she had to go back into intensive care! We are never taking her there again!!! Dont ever go there!!! They might as well let you die!!! Its in the negatives for this hospital!!! They dont do there job right and are also disrespectful!!!<//Review>

Atrocious. The worst hospital I had been in.
From not clean facilities to unqualified staff is just a nightmare.
I had surgery there and my recovery there was the worst, very less to no assistance and oblivious staff to common sense needs a patient would have after surgery.
Avoid this to all cost</text>

This is a horrible place. I went there to get Botox and the Dr (I wish I remember his name) told me that my face looked weird ,not like normal women, and I should look into having a surgery to change the way that my face looks like! Then he called another Dr to talk to me, which is so unethical, why? well I was charged for this dr2 who Dr1 invited to his office to give me tips about not setting under the sun, as the sun will damage my skin! They try to suck your money as much as they could. By either asking another Dr to come and see you, oh and they are pretty sneaky about that as he was like oh sun is bad for you let me call Dr2 to come and talk to you, is that ok? they never told me that I will be charged for Dr2 who talk to me for literary 2min, or by telling you that you are ugly! Watch out I feel so stupid for going to this place. Other things happened that I'm gonna keep to myself.   I never wrote a review before, so apparently that they have upset me that much!< /review>

I took my sister who were on labor to 5th floor whole staff were awesome from the time we arrived till she gave birth they did everything with proficiency, i gave them 5 star.
We transferred to 8th floor (816) some of the staff are not as we expected specially on our d/c day. 3/21
1.there is no d/c teaching to the new mom and dad,just a stack of print out paper no one bother to check if mom or dad able to read and understand the material (barrier to learning)
2.the nurse don't look happy for being called to the room we afraid to call her.
3.the board in the room don't have info about assigned nurse, Charge nurse. MD, what does the nurse assessment of pain scale
4.we were told by our nurse to call here we finish the birth certificate process, when that person came and finished the paper work we called the nurse, she simply sent us a transportation person, who is not training to show us proper way to hold the baby,to answer if u have question, to evaluate her teaching or just to say bye.
5----it is ok i will be happy if the mgt address these and other points mentioned by other reviewers. We put our time and gave you our feedback b/c we want you to serve the community in much more efficiency and proficiency.
Thanks.< /Review>

The nurses are great dont get me wrong..but the fact i have a infected mesh that has a defect in it. I have been told by numerious doctors that it needs to be looked at closely and or fixed. Finally got a surgerion here at California Hospital. And im told to lose 15 pounds first. What!?!?! Im in horrific pain. Hospitalized monthly. Looked at like some medical insurance villian. All i want is relief. I guess this is how they get to keep making money right. I want a better quality of life. And i want to live without pain meds. But no..and whats sad is i get these doctors with attitudes. Go home and if it gets worse come back....really? I have bean here 5 days and same ol same ol
Same ol tests...same ol meds and gonna be sent home with nothing done. Cedars told me to get a lawyer....thats my next step.< /Review>

<Rate>1<//Rate><review>Worse hospital ever... I had a nurse assign to me that never came to check on me. Staff doesn't care about their patients. Everyone had sarcastic attitude and just didn't care. Had to beg for hours to receive my pain medication. Just didn't make me feel human. Very racist place. The treatment towards Americans was insane... They treated the Latino patient like royalty. Doctor cleared me to have liquids took them 4 hours to bring me water.i will never come to this hospital again. Still waiting for surgery. I'm suppose to have ice on face to stop swelling no ice.. I'm just unhappily. I would recommend this place to my worse enemy!!!!< /review>< pictures>

Ive never rated a hospital before but I'm not use to going to a hospital and the nurses tell your business in front of a other patients after I know what's going on and walking away and saying and yelling out my buisness in front of other patients ! Im a very private person so I left after that regarding what I was going for and I was only going for my eye, and was getting treated for something else which I understand there concern but not in that matter and plus still had to wait 8 hrs just to see a doctor serious!!!!!!! I'm very upset and embarrassed never going back to this hospital  again. This hospital is very ghetto bathrooms are horrible had to get in line just to go thru security not even caring how bad u are, this lady was crying in pain and was going thru the machine like three times and finally the third time the lady in pain didn't care and left her bag with the security and ran to get her self checked this was just a very bad experience more happen to me but no need to say more just this will be the last time I go ! I would expected more privacy but not here ! Saying this with full honesty and my God is my witness !</review>

(Read 2 find out why.)

(2/12/15) My father was in a Car Crash due to a drunk driver who crashed him head-on. Miraculously my father wasn't severely hurt. So after the whole drama we decided to go to a hospital because his chest was aching severely even worse than before. We were pretty sure the pain was due to the harsh grasp of the seat belt. We went to go take some X-rays just to make sure he didn't break anything. By the time we got there(01:46am) he was having some trouble breathing. We walk in to the E.R. I sing his name then mine and right before we go to the crowded waiting lounge this lady is shouting, demanding she gets consulted! He states that she has been there for about 8 hours and no one has treated her yet. The security at the desk had to call for backup because she was disrupting the peace. The security asks us to wait in Waiting room 2 so we walk twords the closed double doors sign-in again. The first thing I saw was peolpe. There was people everywhere! Some were sitting down, some people were standing and others where sitting on the floor. There was no waiting room it was just a corridor with some seat which where already taken. Thankfully there was one seat I rush to go and reserve it, while my father follows me. Of course I let him take the seat. I'm left standing with many others. We realized there was about 60 people in the two corridors. We realized this was going to take a while by the most 5 hours. We don't get called on until around 4:30ish it was only for the pain medicine...it took the 4 freaking hours to give him pain medicine. I realized some nurses were just chattering and laughing while all us patients were in pain and wanted some medical attention. I had to wake my father up since he fell asleep. Then on hour later, they finally took him to do this first X-ray...then his heartbeat and his blood. We then had to wait 3 more hours for another X-ray.....it was all ready 09:40ish and we still haven't left, we were cold and tired. The good part was that they were giving out blankets. We still had to wait 3 mor hours fir some paper work.....In the end we left around 12:58pm... We were there for about 11 hours!! If you are ever dying! NEVER COME TO THIS HOSPITAL!!</text><user_id>106362008991393498204< /user_id>< gmapID>

The Maternity ward suck..... This is my 2nd time at this hospital and the same things accord. I arrived at 3:56pm They had me waiting at the registration desk while having contractions for over an hour and still didn't make into a room for observation. I ended up leaving at 6pm to go to another hospital.

<review>Worst experience with a hospital ever. The waiting was ridiculous not because it was too busy but because the PA told one of the nurses after she reaches 20 patients she starts to move slow purposely and don't rush because she says that means she's finished. One of the nurses kept forgetting everything . Like send urine and send blood work to lab. I waited for about 5 hrs and all they did was blood work and gave me a bs diagnosis not friendly and not clean<//review>< gmap_id>

<Text>Daughter was here nd had to schedule a procedure, was kept an extra 2 days, nurses didn't even know what procedure that was getting done, service was slow, didn't get dialysis for 4 days while and tried to send her home without giving her dialysis until i insisted she gets dialysis, procedure doctor nd team started working on her before the meds even kicked in so she felt all the pain, and nobody ever takes responsibility for messing up always wants to blame someone else .<//Text>< Pics>

Im 39 weeks pregnant and do to having a hmo can't go 2 cedar-sinai my doctor sent me here to get induced on monday endless tests they put me in a OB triage room with a broken toilet.i got transfered to a private room was put on a baby moniter and given endless test througout the night. In the morning i was wolken up 2 the most rude insensitive neonatologist that has ever walked the earth. My baby has a chromosome problem and a fatal hear condition needed lots of help once she's born and Dr. henry said she would give my baby no interventions to help my baby live once she's born i wanted to flip out. Then the cardiologist took forever to ok my ob to let me get induced  for lunch they gave me some one else's lunch tray that was half eaten. I hate this place i wish a earthquake would distroy this dreadful place sadly i have to return there 2morrow to try 2 be induced again :(<//Text>

Truly one of the worst places to be hospitalize. Sadly this place does not live up to its standards or even its own commitments. I say this as a past patient, a friend of past patients and currently a family member of a current patient. I have given many chances to this hospital to prove itself as a professional location and care unit but it has failed me time after time. The only way they help who they want to help. Countless times the ER staff is always talking about patients private info or they all all hanging around the registration window chit chatting away while people are trying to sign in. Then after sign in, the wait time is horrible, even if you have insurance. Once seen, the ball doesn't get rolling instead it comes to a halt. Waiting on nothing but endless test, and waiting on results. Test that you probably don't need but they refer to as, "procedure". You end up sleeping the night away waking up to a whole different staff who you once have to inform them why you are there and who you previously spoke and sign in with the previous night. Very unprofessional and in my opinion, "taking it back to the beginning of time". What is next? pencils and erasers in case they make medical prescription mistakes?
Once the whole ordeal of checking in and actually moving out of the ER into your own room ( may I add if your lucky to get a single because usually they are shared even if you request a single), you have to deal with a language barrier with practically 80% of the staff. Most are not even at a 5th grade level of basic English language. I speak English, Spanish and a bit Italian on a good day, but try those languages with them and your out of luck. After a whole day just to get in a bed, you once again have to go through a process of why you visited the location and whats wrong with you, what ever happen to all those test results?
Now, here is the worst part, if you want to believe there can possibly be any worst to this experiences. Try to call the hospital to speak to a family member, no seriously, try it. The constant back and forth and wrong information is ridiculous. They always blame the errors on the system or recent upgrades they had. Really? in one week you get 4 upgrades and no on knows how to use the system? After many years the story gets old. Then, once a complaint is made online, in the HR Dept. and over the phone to Supervisors, guess what? Nothing is done. I have not visited the hospital in a while as a patient, thank god. My current family members have but due to other reasons and location that is the only place, this is just a voice and experience. I can be judge or even hear all the opinion out there about this review but the experiences, my experiences and more are always repeated. Why? Can it be they don't fix matters, instead fix the front entrance and plant a tree and hang up stars and pictures instead and call it a day? Look for yourself.<//review>

One of the worst hospitals I've ever been to, for ER. First, to check you in, the line was out the door, second to open a door for you, or to escort you as they like to call it, the wait was over 40 min! Just so one person could open ONE door! Overall, ER service sucks, then again, it's located in L.A</text>

On December i when to the ER the nurses are very very disrespectful and plus while they were working they were having there littles snacks like if they were on brake it was very discussing seeing them eat and yet having urine test right next to them. I dislike it a lot</Review>

Spent 8 hours waiting to see an uncaring doctor for all of 2 minutes. Terrible facilities, and lots of crazy patients there too. Would never want my friends or family going here.</Review>

< review>
The Security that was there he was dark skin he weres glasses and it was around 12:00 pm he is  very rude it was on a Sunday  1-11-16
In the emergency room  need to change him
My brother  has speech problems
And he wouldn't  let me go in  just to explain y he was going in
Plus  my brother  had just got operated  and I have to let the nurse or Dr now like that they would now is he going in
Hate it I'm trasfering him some were better hate this hospital
Don't recommend it at all</review>

(Translated by Google) It is a hospital garbage, they treated us badly, starting with a nurse who made fun of us because I do not speak English, they kept us waiting for hours outside in the ambulance parking lot because we have covid-19 then an American doctor arrived and told us that they could not help us, I told him my husband and I have pneumonia and he said they don't "have covid" I insisted a lot that he give us medicines and he didn't want to help us, maybe because we are Latino or because he has no vocation this is disappointing, here we are very bad at home and something worse happens to us is the responsibility of the doctor and the nurses of this hospital 😭

(Original)
Es una basura de hospital  nos atendieron mal empezando por una enfermera que se burló  por que no hablo inglés  nos tuveron esperando horas afuera en el parqueo de ambulancias  por que tenemos covid-19  despues llego un doctor  americano y nos dijo que no nos podian ayudar ,yo le dije mi esposo y yo tenemos neumonia y el dijo no "tienen covid " le insisti mucho que nos diera medicamentos  y no nos quizo ayudar ,quizas por que somos latinos o por que el no tiene vocación  esto es decepcionante,aqui estamos muy mal en casa  y algo peor nos llega a pasar es responsabilidad  del medico y las enfermeras de este hospital  😭<//Text>

<text>(Translated by Google) Makes Approx. 5 years on vacation, I took my wife to have a urine analysis done at the hospital laboratory, I entered at 0730 am and they never gave me information about anything, 5 hours and 30 minutes passed and no one told me anything, not even the guard and no one gave me information ,, my wife requested that they notify me and it turns out that they took her to the room without my consent because she had an infection in the urine ,,, because I told them that I was going to be dissatisfied by what happened and that I requested that They will leave my wife ,,, they told me to go to the box to pay ,, it was closed and to return until Monday (It was Saturday approx 3 PM) ,, we returned to Mexico on Sunday and after 3 months I received the statement of account With an amount of approx 3,000 dollars ,,, queeeee ,, I sent my email of disagreement and they never sent me emails again, I was aware of paying what is paid for a urine analysis but such amount of money nooo ,,, , I do not know if they gave part to immigration to deny us the p I associate again with the United States for the debt we contracted, which I don't care about since it is not our intention to return to the United States, but it was a bad experience in that hospital

<Review>(Translated by Google) The truth for me was a nice experience and I had my first baby in this hospital. I really liked how I treated both doctors and nurses, always very attentive to me and my baby. They made us feel safe to me and my husband. Also something that I really liked is that they let my family to see my baby and my including the most pquequeños family other hospitals do not leave because they are minors and is something beautiful that neither children have to miss . Thanks california hospital 😊🥰

La verdad para mi fue una linda experiencia ya que tuve a mi primer bebe en este hospital. Me gusto mucho como  me trataron tanto los doctores como las enfermeras, siempre muy atentos de mi y mi bebe. Nos hicieron sentir seguros a mi y a mi esposo. Algo tambien que me gusto mucho es que dejaron entrar a toda mi familia a ver a mi bebe y a mi incluyendo a los mas pquequeños de la familia otros hospitales  no dejan porque son menores de edad y es algo que hermoso que ni los niños tienen que perderse.

<Text>(Translated by Google) Lousy service as they say that excellent hospital if patients do not have air conditioning they put fans who just pulled the NICU nurses put in the cell in the place where more ingested should be had, nurses come and go with food and not even They put disinfectant on their hands because it is that so many babies develop infections by unprofessional staff who do not have a room to take their food? Mi In my life I had an experience so the room cleaning is done to sleep the boats full of bone waste, perhaps the service is free?

(Original)
Pésimo servicio nose como dicen que excelente hospital si los pacientes no tienen aire acondicionado les ponen ventiladores que apenas jiran las disque enfermeras del NICU metidas en el celular en el lugar donde más ingiere se debe tener, los enfermeros entran y salen con comida y ni siquiera se ponen desinfectante en las manos por que es que tantos bebés desarrollan infecciónes por el personal poco profesional que tienen que acaso no tienen un cuarto para tomar su comida ? 😡😡en mi vida había tenido una experiencia así el aseo del cuarto lo hacen ya para dormir los botes llenos de basura ósea acaso el servicio es gratis???</Text>< GmapID>

(Translated by Google) I sat on a stretcher for hours so that someone would remember that I was waiting ... When a doctor found out, she checked me in 10 minutes to tell me that I should go to another hospital.
