The good folks at Minuteman Palm Desert have been an excellent community partner and service for Friends of the Desert Mountains. They always keep us looking professional and assist us in getting important communications out on time. And talk about quality and value ... we love that their prices mean we can keep our business local!</text>

<time>1617329444675< /time><rate>5<//rate><Review>I needed a real estate sign designed and made. I gave copy and one idea for a palm tree on it and a possible idea for color. Their graphic artist did the rest. The proof came in looking fantastic. I made one minor tweak because I realized an error on my part. The designer turned it around instantly, and a couple of days later I had my sign!! It is more than I could have imagined when I started. They were very responsive and honestly I could not imagine being happier with the entire experience. HIGHLY recommended!<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

I love picking up the phone and giving Minuteman my problem.  It's no problem for them, they are back at me with a proof, and the next day I'm picking up my order.  They take away all my anxiety in such a pleasant way.  Over the years of doing business with them, they know me personally and I enjoy working with them.<//Text>

I am the administrator for a local Podiatry practice.  I found Minuteman Press on the states DOJ website and was thrilled to find a local printer for our needs.  They responded promptly and professionally, guiding me through the process for setting up our account.  I would highly recommend them!</review>

Minuteman Press is simply a Blessing! Two weeks ago I placed an order and forgot. I had a program made and on a Friday night it hit me, I forgot to pick up my programs. 300 programs sitting at the store and it was 5:45pm. The store closed at 5pm and closed on the weekends.  I called in a panic and left a message. A employee called me back and said come by and pick them up and I could pay later. They knew I was in a rush and needed to get to my church in time for the program to start! What a Blessing and I'm truly grateful for the amazing service and support!</Text>

< Review>
We're been using Minuteman Press in Palm Desert for all our printing
needs since we opened 8 weeks ago.  They are great people who have been in the business for a long time and know their stuff.
They've been very accommodating in getting everything back to us in
a very quick turnaround time and we've been pleased with every finished
product...we'll keep using them for all O'Caine's Irish Pub printing needs.<//Review>

<text>Very happy and thankful to Luis our Salesman.   He was very courteous and friendly. He came over and took his time to assist us. I've purchased cars in the past and have to say this was the easiest and only took 2 hrs to drive away with our 2013 Honda Civic. I'm so happy and will definitely tell everyone to check out Sam Linder Honda and especially Luis!! You guys Rock!!<//text><rating>5</rating><Resp>None</Resp></record></dataset><record>

I am writing this on behalf of my 87 year- old great aunt who purchased a car at Sam Linder Honda on 10/26/18.

My great aunt was rear ended in her 2007 Honda CR-V and wanted to purchase another Honda since they are such reliable cars.

She was shown a 2017 Honda HR-V EX w/ navigation (top of the line model) with 3,081 miles. She ended up purchasing the car in cash, wrote a check that day and drove home in her new car. I received a call that she bought a new car and wanted me to see it, I went to her house and saw the car.

She showed me the long, yellow paper which is referred to as the sales contract. I was surprised to see that in line 1a (cost before any tax, fees, etc) that she paid $26,487.74 for the vehicle. On the Honda website the MSRP of a new 2018 model was $26,540. A new one would be $52.26 more than a year old HR-V. She also got a 7 year/75,000 mile warranty for $2,235.

I looked in the glovebox to find the manual and discovered an envelope of papers. I assumed they were my great aunt's and gave them to her. She said it was a sales contract with another persons name on it. We discovered that the woman who purchased the car new one year before left her sales contract in the car. That concerned me being that the car was certified preowned and they didn't check the glovebox, did they check everything else under the hood? Upon opening it up I saw that on line 1a she paid $25,146.00 when the car was new with 59 miles on it and only $1,845 for the same warranty. My great aunt paid $1,341.74 MORE for the exact same car than the first owner did (excluding warranty).

My father, great aunt and I called and spoke to the general sales manager, Al Feria, who was very nice and helpful.

I asked why this car cost more than a new car and he explained that the two plants that produce the EX w/ navigation were out of commission which made that particular model in high demand due to there not being a lot of them. He said that the same day my aunt purchased two other people came in looking to buy it. I looked and found a like model without AWD for $21,500 with 11,000 miles on it.

I brought up that the dealership failed to check the glovebox and left the contract in it from the old owner. The phone disconnected shortly after stating the above but Al immediately returned my call. He said that some employee was getting written up for leaving the contract in the glovebox which is unfortunate but I would be furious if my personal information was left for people to find.

He kept asking how we can fix the situation and I said take the car back. He offered us $23,000 to take the car back which would have been a huge loss in money. I told him that we would would get back to him regarding the warranty and said I was going to post this online for others to see. He then began explaining all the great things Sam Linder does for the community and that he'd take the review personally. I politely ended the call by saying that nothing else needed to be said and I was getting frustrated.

Call it what you want, but I feel that my great aunt was taken advantage of and essentially got ripped off.< /Text>

Honda was really nice to my family and me. We purchased a car on 3/6/21 and ask for Hector. Hector really takes his time to shop for a car with you and is very loyal to his customers. He is a really nice guy and i will do more business with Honda and him. If you are looking to purchase a car with this dealership ask for Hector!</review>

<Text>The service department here is terrible. I bought a used Honda CR-V from another dealer about a hour and a half away and decided to get what’s called a pre-purchase inspection done at Sam Linder Honda. Before dropping the car off I had two concerns: noisy brakes and a noise coming from the rear of the vehicle. Sam Linder’s service department took the car in and didn’t find anything wrong other than it needing an alignment and a brake fluid change. With 40,000 miles on the odometer I figured OK sounds fair. Between the cost of the inspection and the two services I paid over $400. When the car was ready I picked it up after hours when I got out of work. IMMEDIATELY as I was heading home I noticed something was wrong. When I got on the highway I felt a vibration under the front end and after arriving home I heard a ping from the right side every time I turned the wheel. Before even getting out of the car I messaged the service advisor on their messaging service about the two issues. I made it clear that both of these new issues were not present before the car was in there shop. She responded the next morning and asked if I could bring the car back. My wife had some appointments the following few days and we could not take it in right away. We set an appointment for them to take a look at the vehicle a couple weeks later. Initially, during the ride along the tech claimed he couldn’t hear/feel anything but later confirmed he heard the pinging. They told my wife we would need to pay another $180 to have it diagnosed. Naturally I thought that was absurd given the fact we did not have these issues prior to bringing the car in. I called and eventually spoke with the service manager who was quick to tell me there was no way they caused the issues. He pulled up the initial report and I asked if it was possible they did the alignment wrong. He said no because “they only checked the alignment.” I told him no I PAID to have the alignment done. He sounded confused and asked me to hold on. A few moments later he tells me go ahead and bring the car back in and they’ll check everything to make sure the work was done right. I stopped him and asked for clarification on whether or not the alignment I PAID for was actually done. He completely sidestepped the question and repeated for me to just bring the car in and they’ll check it out. I reluctantly agreed thinking he’ll never admit it but at least they’ll get it done now and tell me what else is wrong with the car. Boy was I wrong. After taking the car back in (3rd time now) he tells me everything looks fine but they do hear the noise and will need to charge me $180 for a diagnosis. There is no way I’m paying for something that either they caused or (had it been there all along) they should have caught in the initial inspection I paid over $400 for! I shared my frustration and asked if I had brought the car right back in after initially picking it up and not waited would he still have charged me the $180? To which he literally said to me “Absolutely, you'd be surprised how many times people leave and come right back saying ‘you just did my oil change now my_______ isn’t working’.” At that point I thought I better just get my car the heck out of there before they screw it up even more.

Update: Where I bought the vehicle and my dealings with them is none of your concern. You’re concern should be what is going on your service department.< /Text>< Pics>

< Review>
Decided I didn't want the new 2020 Insight after the first 3 or so miles I put on it  but After Sales Manager Al Feria called and threatened me with court I realized I have to live with it.
Amazing car by the way and friendly staff. I'm do for a free oil change soon so hopefully when I get taken care of I can come back here and change my review and feel better about this place.<//Review>

Worst customer service ever! Bought my first car a couple months ago and they we’re so nice but once I needed a fix on the car they would beat around the bush on what is covered by my extended warranty and basically told me to figure things out by myself. NEVER AGAIN WILL I PURCHASE A CAR FROM THIS DEALERSHIP.< /Review>

Purchased a vehicle on June 6th and then was called back from Mike, Finance Dept. two days later that I needed to put more money toward the down payment.  The vehicle has a small crack windshield and Jim Cash said to call him so that he can schedule an appointment to fix it.  I have texted him twice with no reply, have called service department and there is no answer.  I have been buying vehicles since 2010 and have never experienced such horrible service until now.  My nephew went through the same thing with his vehicle last month.  Will never buy another vehicle from Sam Linder Honda.< /text>

They're all nice and all when you're looking to buy a car. Once you get the car off the lot and something is wrong with your car, they offer no assistance in fixing it. Just a quick look at the car is too much to ask for I guess. Never again do I buy from here.< /text>

Had to order a part for son's car. I walked into Customer Service area where 3 men and 1 woman worked. No one greeted or helped as I stood there...ALL aware I was there. A Caucasian  man walked in 8 minutes after I did, and was greeted and helped almost immediately. I jumped in behind him to get help to get directed to the right area. The heavyset man and older Asian man had offered no help even after they had finished with other customers. The young man in the Parts dept, was very courteous and helpful. I HAD to get receipt from secretary on the side who also displayed poor customer service(I shared my experience about the other dept. to drop her a hint about her snobby attitude..she didn't get it) Picked up part 2 days later and the other Parts dept. man was also courteous and helpful. After reading other reviews, I'm so thankful we didn't purchase my son's  car there!< /text>

I've always been sceptical of having service done at dealerships but Sam Kinder has proven to be a square dealer. They have handled all of the service on our Honda Pilot for 140,000 miles and they have never failed to keep me happy.</text>

First time Honda owner. Bought a vehicle and Jose was very helpful in making our car buying process easier and hassle-free. It was simple and didn't feel pressured. Joe was transparent and easy to work with. This is what car buying should be!</Review>

Lazy lazy lazy... went there New Years Day and guys were just standing around or sitting in the cars. No one helped me. I took down several vin numbers for Hondas I was interested in. Sent them to the Internet sales guy, who said he'd get back to me Jan 2, didnt hear. Called he said he'd get back to me in 30 min. He didn't. He sent me an email saying when I was done shopping bring in the quote. Too bad they lost a sale....  How hard is it to send me a price?</Review>

I had a recall done there. They were very friendly and helpful. I didn't wait very long and had a great experience in the service department. I would recommend Sam Linder Honda service department to anyone who needs service or even their knowledgeable techs can help you out on anything. If they don't have an answer to your question. They can get back to you with an answer promptly.<//review>

So happy with my new car! Sales and Finance really help you get what you really want. I couldn't be anymore happier with it all. Have been to several dealerships at the Salinas auto mall and none of them compare to Sam Linder Honda great customer service.
If your looking to buy a car ask for ANTHONY!!
THANK YOU so much Sam Linder Honda for everything!</review>

I left early from my Tahoe trip to drive to Salinas to pick up a car I said I was going to buy. Told them to get the financing going and I'll make it there by 5pm. Once I get to Rocklin, around 11:30am they tell me they sold it. Terrible service. Not how you treat a potential customer.<//Review>

The service department never answers the phone, and doesn't return phone calls either.

Now I'm not insulting the people in the service department, they are all clearly busy, hardworking, and in my experience, kind.

This is a management issue. I call, and 2 seconds later the front desk answers, transfers me to service, then the phone is never answered. You have one employee literally doing nothing (zero wait time) at the front desk, and everyone in service is so slammed constantly that they don't have time to answer the phone or return calls.

Why don't you guys allow the front desk person to book repairs? Instead of having a physical book logging all the repairs, why not have a Google dock or spreadsheet everyone can edit? That way that receptionist can get a dollar raise and start actually working as hard as the people in service. Regardless of how you do it, the system doesn't work as is.

Before Christmas, I called service to request a quote on roof racks for my CRV. My call was never answered, and my voicemail was not returned. More recently I called again with no answer and did not bother to leave a voicemail. Simply put, I come here to pay hundreds, if not thousands of dollars on repairs. I expect to have my phone calls answered, thank you.

+1 stars for the excellent and professional service I have received in person from Frank despite his being very busy.</Text>

<rating>1</rating><Text>Very high pressure sales team. Finance department makes it seem like if you don't buy a car that day your wasting their time.  They really tried to make me agree if they can meet the payment I was after that I would guarantee to take the car. I guess they can't just give you a quote and let you think about it. I hate that there is a middle person and your making a deal with a mysterious person in a magical room, they try to sell all these extra warranties and alarm etc.  By the time everything is said and done their making like 15k in extra in interest and insurances. Definitely not purchasing a car from Sam Linder!< /Text>< pictures>

Absolutely the opposite of the 4 other Honda dealers I tried to do business with.  They were Honest and upfront from the get -go.   I was not the most pleasant person to deal with since I was already super frustrated at not being able to get the Honda Pilot I wanted.  Omar was so patient and totally made the process painless.   I drove 1-1/2 hours to Salinas and it was worth every minute.  I can't recommend them enough.</Review>

Took my car for a service about a week ago. Before I got there, the car looked like it always has. I left my car here for a service, came to pick it up and saw this noticeable scratch on the front right bumper of my car. I was so disappointed that they denied that anything happened to my car while it was there. Car came in scratch free and was returned with a scratch. They just don't take responsibility for anything that goes wrong. They are such Scrooges. The manager even brought a "professional" to inspect the scratch to determine if it happened within "24 hours" but like I expected, the guy said it didn't happen there. For all I know, they must have both agreed to just deny that the scratch happened there because they know it would cost them. They offered a cheapy, crappy offer but it was not worth it. Why do I have to pay for something that was not my fault? My advice, take your car for service elsewhere and buy a car from another Honda dealer. You will save money and time!<//Text>

I stopped by few times and the customer service is really awesome and the parts department they are very professional,
Very clean facility, good enough parkings, and they have like breakfast entrees always so you can grab something,  in the future if I would like to buy a car will be there!!</Review>

< Review>
Went in to have my airbags replaced and it was a completely free service. The shuttle was a little slow on time, but I understand seeing as there are other customers who need it. Overall good experience and nothing seemed to be broken or misplaced.
Went another day to look at buying another car with my boyfriend. John, the salesman, was helpful, but a bit too assertive in trying to sell us a vehicle. We wanted to explore our options and he understood, but still tried to get us to purchase. As we left, John forgot to give my boyfriend his registration form for his car. We did not realise this until we went to the dealership across and they asked us for those papers.
Good service, pushy salesman.< /Review>

The dealer offered a price for a car i like, and i thought the deal is good and come to the place to pay and get my car, then be told all the same model were sold, but they can get me one if i can pay more. WTH? Is there any way this kind of unhonest behaivor be disciplined?<//text>< username>

Went to this dealer with a friend because we were curious about a couple cars on the lot. As soon as the guy who approached us found out we weren't going to buy a car, they seemed very uninterested in doing anything with us. He said "if you're buying a car then I can do that for you but if not, we have other customers to help." He added that if we wanted to wait a little he could get someone for us but we waited about 20 minutes and no one came out so we just left.

This place just seems uninterested in working with new potential customers. The other dealers we went to in the area had good hospitality and let us test drive the cars we wanted. I get that they're in the business of selling cars but if I was truly in the market for a car right now, this experience would definitely cross this dealership off my list of places to give my business to.</Text>

<Text>Went to several dealerships from Visalia to Santa Cruz looking for a new Honda Civic. I’m the type of person that likes to “shop around”, and “do my homework”. I ended up coming back to this dealership several times to test drive and go over all the different models and prices.
Huge THANKS to A.J. SOTO. Thank You for putting in the work, giving me great customer service, going over every last detail, programming my door locks & car settings, and of course “getting me the best deal possible”.... Thank you Sam Linder for the great service.</Text><UserId.>112390870540492126312<//UserId.>< rate>

<review>As a first time buyer I never would have imagined buyin a car being so easy. The gentleman Cesar who initially help me was absolutely courteous, respectful, and beyond helpful. In shopping for a Honda Civic it was the complete opposite experience I had at another local Honda dealer. I drove off with both the car and deal I was looking for. I would absolutely recommend Sam Linders for any first time buyer!</review>< Resp>

This could probably be said of plenty of dealers but...

We went to look at cars, and they were completely uninterested in helping us. When someone finally came out to check on us we talked for a bit but when it was found that we weren’t buying a car THAT DAY they pretty much implied we should just leave because they have real customers to deal with.

I get it, you guys need sales. I really do. But spending upward of 10 large on a car is no small decision and I’m not going to make a purchase that large in one day without sleeping on it. Take some lessons from your neighbors on the auto mall, because the Kia and Mazda lots are nowhere near as pushy nor as angry if you’re not ready to plunk down THAT day.<//review>

<Review>Worst service ever by Edward who quoted a time and services were not complete. When brought to his attention he denied saying that. When checked out he didn't even have the courtesy to let me know what they did not finish. Spoke to Sharon on matter and she was no help at all not a good representative for customer service. Also shuttle took over 45 min to come back we ended up walking. Will not return to this location again.<//Review>< pics>

<text>I was in the market for a new Honda Civic hatchback touring, the MSRP is $29645, and this dealership offered me a price of $27500.
At first glance it seemed like a great sale. The dealership had 3 Honda Civic Hatchback Tourings, 2 blue and 1 sonic gray. When I showed interest in the sonic gray they immediately changed the offer of $27500 back to a firm MSRP. Because of the "rare" color . The saleman John Alvarado as well as his manager Dan came out to speak with me to tell me a blatant lie that there's only 2 sonic gray civics for sale in California and they can't sell it me for the discussed price of $27500. The best they could do was knock $500 off the MSRP due to a military discount. So I went to a Honda dealership in Seaside and they got me a sonic gray Honda civic sport touring for $27,900.<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

I would have given 5 stars if not for the weak attempt to sneak an extended warranty into the deal.  Otherwise, Imad and Sean provided a good car buying experience, as far as car buying experiences go. I would have preferred the negotiation process to have been less dramatic, and definitely wished the paperwork process would have gone much more quickly. Or at least, if it's really necessary to have us wait in the little cubby for 2 hours, provide free snacks and drinks, and maybe a bowl of Lego blocks, to ease the pain of sitting and waiting.</text>

<Review>I took my Honda Pilot in for a simple oil change and picked it up later the day.  When I got home I realized that two of the magnetic signs on my car were gone.  I went back to the dealership and they told me that they had removed the signs to wash the car (a service that I had not asked for) and they said that the signs were put back on.  I told them that the signs must have been replaced improperly and blown off during my highway drive home.

I purchased new signs and gave them the bill for $109.26 which I was told they would pay.  It's been 2 months and multiple phone calls to both Sharon, who is incredibly rude, and Oscar.  Still no check.

Because THEY decided to wash my car and did not put the signs back on properly, I am out $100!  I will never go back to Sam Linder's dealership in Salinas.  They are customer service at it's worst.<//Review>< Pics>

Called to check price as I driving down from SF bay area for Odyssey EX-L. Told them it  did not make sense to drive with out having a sense of price.  Spoke with Jose and no interest in doing business.  Seems like they are intent on wasting time and wearing customers down before they buy - Not a good place to buy cars.< /Text>

Sam Linder's management team are the worst.  From the Sales Manager to the Service Department.   Bring your car there at your own peril.  Make sure to read the service write up sheet or you will be sorry.   Rude management!  Shisters.  Should be founding members of Worst Business Bureau.<//review>

<review>My family member bought a CRV back in January of this year and recently started having trouble making her payment. She asked me to see if there was anything Sam Linder Honda could do to help her, I wasn't very optimistic since she had bought the car 6 months ago. When I called I was put in contact with the Sales Manager Al Feria, which turned out to be a blessing! Al was very receptive to her situation and started looking at her options immediately. He was able to get her into a brand new Civic and lower her payment by $250.00 a month. I have to tell this was best experience I have ever had with any car Dealership, Thanks Al!< /review>< pics>

< Review>
My first experience with Honda service at Sam Linder was not good.  My tire pressure light went on while driving just two weeks after taking ownership.  I called Sam Linder service department and left three message over two days.  Having none of my messages returned, I took the car in.  They found the tires were over significantly over inflated.  How does this happen when they supposedly do a careful inspection before any car leaves the lot?  They told me it could not have left that way - basically saying I over inflated the tires!  Why would I do that?  All they needed to do was apologize but instead have made me one angry Accord owner.  I'll find other service options thank you very much.<//Review>

Dear Sam Linder Honda,
I have just recently moved here from Nebraska with my fiance for military reasons and we went to you hoping to do business and replace my endlessly broken down Buick. Unfortunately however due to your salesman Jim Cash we will not be doing business with you now or ever. Not when it's time to replace the car we got somewhere else and not when I have children who need a vehicle. Due to Jim Cash and his dishonesty, complete and utter lack of respect and total disinterest in doing his job we took our business elsewhere. Not only will we not do business with you but neither will my mother, who is looking to replace her vehicle, but also my fiance's work team, unit and superiors are less than thrilled at our treatment and more than willing to take their business elsewhere as well. So congratulations to Jim Cash on losing your company literally generations of customers. Not to mention the thousands of dollars that would have come with them. Well done.< /Text>

I just purchased a new 2013 Honda Accord and I was treated with respect and ease. I would refer anyone. In addition the dealer is a Motor Trend dealer, and I got free key replacement and free dent repair also!<//text>

< Review>
Sam Linder Land Rover Jaguar Monterey - not helpful in finding out why I had not received my title or registration months after I paid in full for a pre-owned vehicle I purchased from them. Their GM is the picture perfect example of the slippery, fast talking used car salesman who thinks he's cool. I had to go to the DMV and find out that they were in violation of two CA Vehicle Codes before he would help. Between my sister and myself, we have purchased 3 cars from this dealer and used their service departments. Retaining customers is not important to them.<//Review>

<Review>The "Motor Trend" van I purchased with the implicite thorough inspection was presented as a no hit, impeccable vehicle. I found evidence of body damage - concealed - broken interior parts - only one of two keys (which is still wanting 3 years later). The milage was much lower than promised. I was going to unwind the sale based on fraud, but was persuaded by the head of used car sales to keep the car as he knew of a way to fix the milage (which turned out to be useless for MY can). Altogether reinforces the image of the slippery used car salesman.<//Review><Gmap_id>0x808dff10777587eb:0x7d08bd70f003fbfe< /Gmap_id><UserId.>110183141874882022845< /UserId.>< Time>

<Review>Call them on (5/22/17) because my acura tsx steering had a problem and it was the rack and pinion. They said they had one and to come in. So i got a tow truck from san ardo all the way here and when i got there i told the guy that i called earler and told them the guy i spoke too. And told me they did not have the part. So i got stuck here for more then 2 hours getting a another tow truck to take me to another dealership to replace my part!</Review></record></dataset><record>

<Text>I bought a 2006 Chrysler 300 Touring about 1 month ago, great customer service before you sign contract, after signing contract to purchase the car, the dealer (from salinas) were seriously the most hard people to work with, they sold me a car with the heater not working, the back window not working, and the check engine light came up about a week after buying the car. I called the dealer to let them know what was going on, and they said that they had to go threw some approval process before then can work on it, so i waited about 3-4 days, they then gave me a call back and said that they were gonna fix the check engine light, the heater, but not the back window, i was so mad, i mean they should up step up and fixed everything because the car didnt even have half a week and these problems came up. It should be illegal to sell a car that has problems. So i left the car there for a few days and then they said they had fixed the check engine light and the heater, BUT the heater was still not working, and once again i had to wait for approval, which makes no sense because the had already approved it, and the problem was never fixed so why did i have to wait again for approval??? I literally had to have a blanket with me in the mornings and at night due to the heater not working, it took about another week to hear from them, and the service team said that the sales department didnt want to approve it, but that they were gonna help me out to fix it anyways. It was such an inconvenience to have to go threw all these. THEY SHOULD OF FIXED THE PROBLEM WITH IN THAT FIRST WEEK WHEN I TOLD THEM, ITS CALLED "CUSTOMER SERVICE"!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I told the sales manager and the sales guy that we decided to go with this dealer because they were known and we knew we weren't gonna run into problems like the other small dealers around,  BUT BOY WERE WE WRONG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I DO NOT RECOMMEND TO SHOP AT  THE SALINAS SAM LINDER!!!!!< /Text>< pictures>

It's like most car buying experiences. You have to watch your wallet with add on's. Then you leave not really knowing how good of a deal you just received.</Text>

(Translated by Google) I went to see a honda accord 2020 and the seller asked me for my information only for an estimate and I swear it would not affect my credit, a day later I got an email that had -7 points on my credit 😡 and he was upset and treated me very bad just because I didn't want to give him $ 5,000 down payment

<date>1612416034106</date><text>Had my car stolen and chp called this place to tow my car. It happened to be a holiday weekend inwhich they where closed when chp notified me of whereabouts of my car. Well it ended up being a 5 day period my car stayed. I explained that i am a single disabled father of a 3 year old who collects foodstamps. My 2 neighbors are helping me cause i cannot afford to get car out and asked if he could please work with me in anyway on the price.
Well not only did i get robbed when car was stolen but the tow company robbed me even more tremendously wicked inconsiderate just flat of mean person wont budge what so ever on the $850 price tag to get the car out.
If u have a choice in a tow or tire place then stay away unless you wanna get robbed too.< /text>< userid>

Amazing service and friendly helpful service.  I had a huge 4 inch crack in my tow hitch on both sides that formed on my motorhome after my hitch dragged at a dip in and out of a gas station.  My truck was on the trailer that I was towing behind my motorhome. Thought my trip was ruined and my schedule was going to be screwed for my cross country trip but these guys came to the rescue with a welder on site that took the receiver off, hammered everything back into place, and welded it on the spot stronger than before and remounted it to the frame.  Only had a 4 hour delay and the price was more than reasonable.  Trip and schedule saved by this amazing business.<//review>

Went to pick up the car and they wouldn't give us the car without giving them $200 more in cash.  The lady wouldn't give us a receipt.  I think she just kept the cash.  What a ripoff.< /Text>

This business was a lifesaver when I blew a tire on my RV, and then discovered I had been sold a used RV with out of date tires that were all bulging out and ready to blow. They gave me a good price on tires and did a good job changing them out.<//Review>

Best truck wash in the area. Service is always quick, surprisingly friendly staff. Usually you have quiet guys washing or grumpy guys.  You can tell these guys are having fun at this wash. They wash anything from cars up to semi trucks and trailers.
Very quick service too. 15 to 20 minutes on a large truck. It wasnt too dirty so don't expect the same time for any type of mess. Haha. They also do tires, i didn't need any at the time, but I'm sure they have great service there too.</text>

Castro came to fix a flate tire on our Southwind RV and I must say his presence was truly a  blessing.  We had been stranded on the side of the road on I5 South 355 miles North of Bakerfields since 2/10/2019 on or about 3:15pm. Castro took care of our flat tire and tied up some loose wires caused by the blow out. Castro went over and above to ensure our safety by  following us to the nearest  gas station to make sure we  got gas and everything was ok. We are so thankful for him and his wonderful customer service. I highly recommend Castro Tire Services &  Truck Wash.< /Text>

Our tire made some noise when driving on I-5 after dinner stop at lost hill, we decided to check it out more carefully at a tire shop. Google search tell us Castro Tire opens late till 11pm. Their rating of 4.3 lead us to this location. They are good as rated. The gentleman at Castro Tire checked all four tires carefully and point out the one that made noise, gave a reasonable and honest total out of pocket price up front. Once we decide to make the replacement, the job is done quickly. He also checked pressure and re-inflated on all 4 tires.  We got back on the road within an hour, and I can feel the car drives more smoothly after the tire replacement.</text>

my friend and I were stuck on the side of the road near Bakersfield feeling like our road trip was ruined, but luckily we were met with a super cool, helpful guy who couldn't have been more what what we needed at that moment. he got us on our way sooner than we expected and saved us money by hooking us up with someone to repair our car. these are the people to call if you're in the unfortunate position we were in.<//review>

We were driving to Texas for a funeral, so we didn't have a lot of time and we were only 4 hours into our trip.  We got a flat tire... what I didn't realize was that my Hyundai Sonata Hybrid didn't have a spare tire, or a donut! Have AAA, but knew that we would lose a lot of time being towed to a gas station then would have to find a tire company and a purchase and change, which could have taken hours since the closest service station served only semi's.

So my boyfriend found Castro, who came out and replaced the tire right on the side of I-5, and we were on the road in 2 hours all said and done. The young man who served us was wonderful.

Castro Tire- Thanks a million!! Kate Wiley</Review></record>

I was on my way back to medford from southern California when I hit something in the road. I blew two tires. I called the store for a tow. Walter showed up in 15 mins. He said the tow truck would be two hours. Instead he took off my tires and went to the store. They did not have my size tires but Walter did not give up, he said he would call the Bakersfield store. They had my tires so he drove to Bakersfield. In just three hours me and my granddaughter was back on the road. Walter did not give up trying to fix my car, also working in 90 degree heat!< /text>

Takes 2 hours to wash just a tractor.  Slowest and worst truck wash I have ever been to.  I would give it zero stars.< /text>

(Translated by Google) If there were zero stars, that would give it the lady who is there has horrible customer service when I arrived I had to ask for help later the lady thought that I can't pay what things cost there and she sent me to forever 21 to buy it that she does not know is that I even have to buy the laughter of the ignorant lady

(Original)
Si hubiera cero estrellas esa le pondria la señora que esta ahi tiene un servicio al cliente horrible cuando llegue tuve que preguntar por ayuda despues la señora penso que yo no puedo pagar lo que cuestan las cosas ahi y me mando a la forever 21 a comprar Lo que ella no sabe es que tengo hasta para comprarle la risa a la señora ignorante< /review>

Hey, stop by this place and treat you car to a super foamy brush wash, then top it off with a hot wax job.
Their wax goes on as a liquid and really makes your car shine.<//Review>

$2.50 for 5 minutes (nothing less). Cash only and remember to bring cash! This self car wash is wonderful. Only 1-2 people were there during my wash and I was able to take all the time I need. The pressure hose is very strong and got rid of a lot of gunk that I would normally have to scrub off. I only used the presoak, pressure water, and spotless rinse. The area is well maintained, kept clean, and in a nice quiet neighborhood.

If you want to spend $5 to clean your car, this place is the place to go to. Just remember to plan around the limited time and enjoy a clean car!<//review>

$2.50, machine takes dollar bills, but note no change back. The pressure is really good here and never had any issues with soap being empty or any function not working. The vacuums suck in any good way, maybe too good - sucked up one of the plastic connection pieces on my floor mat. This wash is slightly out of the way for me but worth the detour due to the good pressure and everything being in order.</review>

They had me back on the road in under 20 minutes and it was a busy summer day in their shop. Great service as always at this longtime independent shop.<//Review>< Resp>

They are always so friendly. The technicians here are A+ and so nice. I often find mechanics and others intimidating, but it's a very welcoming staff. Plus the prices are very fair.</Review>

My provider at the A Street clinic was amazing. She listened to my concerns and helped me find the right treatment options. I was prepared to have to fight for what I wanted but she took the time to listen. I hope she stays at Camarena because it seems like all the good Drs leave!< /review>

<Review>The Doctors are great here. I am glad to be able to go here the services they provide are the best in the city. I would recommend Camarena health to anyone seeking treatment because I know Camarena cares. Five stars isn’t enough they get a ten out of ten in my book.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

I have a job and couldn’t just reschedule or I would have gone somewhere else I have super high anxiety and not once did they mention before hand that they don’t use laughing gas whatsoever. They saw I was shaking and have anxiety and were honestly rude when I expressed and I didn’t think I could sit thru it with just the local. Then at the end when the dr did the stitches I could feel the pain. I left there office shaking and having an anxiety attack. As an adult and mother I will never bring my child to that office after being treated like that nor every trust your office. You should tell your patients your too cheap to offer what other offices do<//text>< Pics>

<Rate>5<//Rate><review>I appreciate Camarena health centers so much. They are quite professional and courteous. The girls are all wonderful and friendly. Dr. Jadaun is an excellent doctor who is always aware and definitely on top of his game as a doctor. I am a caregiver to two elderly people 24/7 Dr. Jadaun is an excellent doctor looking after all 3 of us and asking the right questions to get to nitty gritty of situation. Whenever Ive had an emergency I get a walk in appointment set up. They call me within a few minutes of my appointment. I'm telling you in all my years of living here in Madera and Fresno never such a professional and attentive clinic than Camarena health. If I ever move out of town I am hoping to keep them and Dr. Jadaun as my healthcare providers.</review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1621021949024, 'text': 'Thank you for taking the time to review.

The dentist is great. He always listens to my concerns and what I want to get done next. My teeth need a lot of work and I have many appointments before theyre all nice and ready to go. But he is willing to accomodate my own desires. Hes afficient and fast. I loved it!< /review>

Camarena scams people.They purposefully schedule many appointments and do the bare minimum on each visit to charge your insurance more money. The dentist was so rough and I was left in so much pain. They don’t care about their patients just about the money. I will never be going back.< /review>

They are very friendly and the people in the front desk are always willing to help everyone. They have 2 floors and they sometimes are pretty slow so, be prepared to wait. Earlier in the morning is much better and guaranteed to get you in sooner. They have restrooms and baby changing compartments. Always make sure to call ahead to confirm your appointment because sometimes they will change them.</text>

< Review>
The food was tasty and our waitress was friendly and helpful.  What turned me off big time was how messy/dirty the place looked, including the bathroom.  There was stuff all over the floor, tables not cleared off, garbage/paper pieces scattered around.  My only guess was that they were very short staffed.  It took quite awhile to get seated even though there were many empty tables and even longer to pay and leave.<//Review>

Staff is extremely lacking communication I sat for 30 minutes waiting for breakfast. Then I had to sit and wait for another 5 minutes for a piece of toast because he did not bring me my order all together. Rather he brought it in pieces. The waiter handed everyone at my table someone else's drink so we had to play drink swap. I had to wait for 10 minutes after finishing my meal for them to bring me my check. I would highly recommend going to the one closer to 50 the staff is much nicer and your food will taste better.</Text>

<Name>Bonnie Nordyke<//Name><Date>1477255715513</Date><text>Great place to come if you want to stand for over a half an hour to be ignored. Eventually we were seated and the waitress Dora was nice.
Tried speaking with the manager Micki who was very rude and it was quite clear that she didn't care about the poor customer service and she had absolutely no customer service skills heraelf. It's quite clear that she doesn't like working here and that she doesn't care about the customers.< /text><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

very very poor service. the waitress went to a table that was seated after us and didn't even bother to ask if we have been helped yet. every time we go to this location the service is poor and the food there is so so.< /review>

Jamie took my order over the phone and was super sweet. Usually when I phone in an order to places I'm rushed and talked over which results in an incorrect order. The lady at the front desk confirmed everything and was nice and friendly as well. I took my order home and everything was exactly how I ordered it, hot and tasted great. Pleasantly surprised.<//Text>

Very friendly servers, good food and very reasonable prices. A little understaffed at times, but still run to make you happy!< /Review>

<text>Everyone who works here is super nice and friendly BUT.... The wait time for the food is always long.. Too long in fact.. By the time you get your food your so tired of sitting there you just want to go... Although they tell you sorry you had to wait so long they dont even accomidate the fact you sat there for an hour with nothing..  Its always one thing or another at this location but i give 3 stars for the friendly people working here..<//text><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None< /Response><Gmap_id>0x809ade2576cb64e3:0x33c3084b128220be<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

The staff is great, but the owners are horrible. They are not willing to pay for enough staff to properly serve all guests in a timely manner. The staff tries to make up for it, but often times people walk out because there just aren't enough workers at the restaurant. I would not recommend going there unless you have plenty of time to wait.< /Review>

Had a delicious dish when I couldnt bother cooking one morning. Waitresses actually filled my water without being asked and struck up conversation even though I was obviously poor and could not tip.<//Review>

Good service.
Went in for a flat repair on a tire they do not stock. Tiee was almost new but could not be repaired. Tire still held air but large screw near the side wall.
They gave me options and estimates with no pressure.
Ended up ordering a tire and got it installed 2 days later. (I was not in a rush.)< /review>

<Text>I serviced both of my vehicles there (my toyota camry and scion tc ). They did a oil change, new 4 tires each vehicle and lifetime alignment which I told Eric that I want the one time alignment but I still lowkey charge me for a lifetime. Its sokaySo, during the service I saw these two technicians competing with each other on who will finish first. I thought they were 100% accurate because they are a senior technicians. I saw the filipino technician that was doing my vehicle on wheel balancer was not balancing it properly. I mean I see him not following what the machine tell him to put. All i see is RED! Not “ zero or .25” . I’m a mechanic myself so i know how to read that machine. So i asked him, “ is that normal to leave it like that” he said “ yes! “ . So i let it be. After service  we drove back home. I felt my car was very uncomfortable it’s very stiff and tires wobble on 65 mph. I immediately texted Eric the store manager about it. He said “it’s because you have a new tires on”. So i said “okay”. After maybe 1 week my car is still uncomfortable to drive so i texted eric again about it. I went back to get my tires rebalance and check the alignment. They saw that my to rear tires are way off. Meaning the previous technician didn’t do it safely or he just did it so quick without thinking what’s the right balance.. I’m so upset of my experience. So now i have to come back there this coming sunday to double check my toyota camry. This is unacceptable experience for me . This is a major safety specially We drive our vehicles on daily basis and the store manager knew that we are expecting a baby. That’s why I brought two vehicles for service.

When I came back on Feb 22nd 2021. No one even said sorry for the inconvenience or apologize for their mistake.
I also checked all of my tire pressure before going back there and it was on 45psi all around my car spec is 32psi that’s way off.<//Text>< pics>

Horrible service! Took my car to get new tires but as soon as I took it to work my low tire light came on. Took it back and tech said a tpms sensor is faulty and will need to be replaced quoted over $200 in repairs for something one of the techs damaged when replacing tires. Note my car is only 20k miles. Refused to take responsibility. Never returning<//Review>

<review>Brought in my still pretty new car with a flat tire, it only has 3300 miles on the car therefor 3300 miles on the tire as well. I was told there were 3 punctures and they would not repair it. I asked of course for the cost of a new tire and was given a price quote of $240+. I declined and left to another tire shop. Wheel works chalked the puncture marks, but there were only 2 arrow marks on my tire.
Next tire shop only found 2 punctures and repaired it for 30 bucks. So wheel works lied about how many punctures, and a quick call to Fremont, and Dublin wheel works said they would repair a tire with only 2 punctures. That's now 2 lies and they tried to make me pay 240 bucks for 1 tire,  that on avg you can buy for 70-85 dollars with low to mid grade ranges.

It's a classic tire-store-that-also-does-other-maintenance. In my case this meant I waited forever to get a simple headlamp bulb changed, even though there was only one car ahead of mine. Nevertheless, the work was done well.</review>

The good part is that all of the employees were nice and responsive when I asked questions.  The frustrating part was I was not kept informed of the status of my car.  My appointment was for 3 pm and after an hour, they finally took my car.  After 2 hours, I noticed that a whole new set of customers were waiting with me and inquired about the status.  A while later they came out and asked me for the "key for the lug nuts".  I had no idea so they left and another hour later and I am the last person in the waiting room, I asked again and finally got my car.  I inquired about the lug nut key and they said they had confused my car with another.  He said he had to take everything out of my trunk initially looking for the lock--very confusing messages but my trunk was full so I would have liked to be informed first.  Then my screen on my car was changed and I asked them what they had touched so I could change it back.  No one could tell me and they referred me back to Honda.  I don't know why I became the last customer to be serviced but it was bizarre.<//text>

< Review>
My car broke down and these guys want to chart me $550 for a job that Subaru Putnam will charge me $260.   They also want to charge me $700 for a new alternator and I asked around and people are telling me those are outrageous prices. I think they may be taking advantage of me and the fact that my car is broke down and in their lot.  Also, as far as their price matching - it's non existent.  Everybody was very professional and helpful over the phone until I called about the price match and the man turned angry and defensive. He said the parts "have to match EXACTLY" and everything has to match EXACTLY the way THEY drew it up (Who is going to TRY to match what HOW they want to fix my car - no, a good mechanic is going to try to FIX the car how it helps the CUSTOMER the most!  Also, they will not receive the quote I have from the other mechanic through email and I need to come into the SHOP even though I don't have a car - costs time and money for a taxi.... Very unhelpful.  Make it as difficult as possible for your customers?  I am going to get my car towed out of there and go to my Subaru Expert and get it fixed there for a much cheaper price - at least then I'll know that I have Subaru experts and I know my car will be fixed to the best ability and if it can't be fixed - then I can live with that.  I would avoid this mechanic, unless you want to pay 2.5x what it costs to fix your car - have them waste your time, too, and perhaps have extra charges added that are not needed.</Review>

Called this place for a tire that was losing air.
Took these guys about 5 hours before they cups look at my 1 deflating tiring, they said it was NOT repairable and I’d need to buy a new one. Went from 25-30$$$ repair to buying a $130 new one from them. Told them to keep my tire so I could inspect the damage myself. Took it to another shop and they said they can repair it No Problem!?!?!?
These guys are freakin SCAM ARTIST ! Make sure you know what’s really wrong with your tire and whether if it’s repairable or not, than test these guys to see if they know what they’re are talking about.. Nothing but a bunch of Lazy mechanics trying to steal your money< /review>

Staff isn't very informative. Didn't even show me the tires they were putting on my car. If I had seen them I wouldn't have bought them... Now I have tired I don't even like on my car. And SUV shouldn't have "car tires" in my opinion.<//text>

They have a 7 room bed and breakfast with 3 hot tubs. And several rental homes. We rented the 1 bedroom rental house called the bunkhouse. It has a fully equipped kitchen with a coffee pot, a shower, space heater that looks like a fireplace. Even bath robes for your private hot tub just outside the front door. The views are incredible from everywhere in and outside the house. We even watched Buffalo grazing from our natural springs hot tub. There's an small ghost Town with neat stuff to look at and an old cemetery up the hill.<//Text>

<text>Camped at Benton Hot Springs for two nights. Due to Covid restrictions I never went into a building. Registration was outside and contactless. Specific instructions about proper campground etiquette were written down with a signed agreement and a copy for guests. Each campsite had its own tub and was as private as physically possible without constructing a complete barrier around the tubs. The campsite tubs are drained and cleaned after guests depart. The campground is clean and free of litter. Reservations are months out, and all campsites are full.  This is a little gem on a less traveled road.</text>< Date>

Love our stay at the Tub Sites!

As a hot spring afficionado, I had to visit the Benton Hot Springs. We stayed for one night, tub was super clean and the temperature was perfect to soak for hours without getting overheated. There's nothing better than sitting in the hot tub at night with the crisp air around you, watching the stars for hours.

Bring a robe and extra towels with you if you're camping.

Will definitely be back again in the future to spend a full day.<//text>

Friendly accommodating staff there to welcome you. Comfy eclectic settings and clean rooms. Many clean hot springs tubs to choose from with soft fluffy robes available for use. Located in lovely shaded desert setting. Shaded outdoor seating available under big leafy trees. There is even a very friendly feline there that loves to be petted.
Great way to meet people from different walks of life and share a wonderful deliciously  prepared breakfast in the morning. Two breakfast times to choose from, 8 or 9 AM.< /review>

This place is Awesome! Relaxing, enjoyable. My first time there and it has to be on my number one places to go now. The atmosphere was incredible! Hot springs were the best was to unwind from everyday life. If your looking for a place to get away from it all and just relax this is the place. Rooms are incredible with a history and a time of their own. Simply AWESOME!<//text>

<review>You would think with it being 100 degree weather the owners of this establishment would be considerate of their guest and think of them being in direct sunlight as a problem however they could care less!! Honestly how is anyone supposed to enjoy themselves when the sun is beating down on you with no shade option besides the one in the 90degree tub.very disappoint with management and how they treat guest would only reccomend to someone I hate to stay here.no customer service full of bugs and rudeness DONT GO HERE !!!!! Many other places that offer the same thing with more care don’t go here !!<//review>< Name>

The only thing I would suggest is a coffee pot with coffee, hot tea  cause it’s nice to enjoy in evening . A vending machine with cold drinks snacks for guest to have access too if there late arrival or just want something to drink after hours. But yes I will come again & suggest this place to all my friends.😊👍<//text><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

< review>
Camping at Benton hot springs was a worthy challenge.  Online reservations were easy, though I wish there was more info on particular sites.  Nonetheless I booked site 3 which was very relaxing, each site seemed to have its own uniqueness and privacy.  it rained/snowed on our arrival night which made things a bit cold and wet. Travel dates middle of March 2020, Chains were not required.  Light snow, ice cold temps overnight, and partly sunny days.  It was nice to arrive with tub being filled with hot water. Odorless, very hot water. (Warning for those who are sensitive to hot soaking temps) Camp site had bbq and fire pit, picnic table.  No wood to be bought on site.  Actually nothing to be bought on site so bring everything in. Otherwise a grocery store is in bishop (40 mins away) no cell signal or WiFi unless you’re staying at the “inn” also breakfast is not included for guests staying at campsites or cabin rentals.  Bring your ez up. The best things about Benton hot springs:  Dogs allowed, Each campsite has its own private tub, & clothing optional.
For the price to camp in freezing wet temps, I would expect at least shower facilities or toilet, not Porto potties. Also some signage or information on water properties, etc. front desk staff was not very helpful.  They did not ask once how our water temp was or anything, and it was scalding at first.  Though I am pretty self sufficient I could see how guests would have a hard time navigating to their site if arriving after dark.  But the experience and hot springs makes things well worth the stay.<//review>

The tub sites are rustic camping spots with fire pit, grill, a place to pitch a tent and a private tub. The sites are partially screened from each other by foliage and/or fairly unobtrusive wooden barriers. A great place to relax and have a soak within sight of the White mountains.<//text>

We loved our stay in the miners cabin! The cabin was quite rustic, but included all the details to make sure you're comfortable. This is the perfect place if you're serious about getting away from the hustle. Word to the wise, there's a small diner a few miles away for dinner, but it closes early.< /Text>

It's a surprising place! When you arrive, at a first glance, it looks like other places but then you discover how beautiful and welcoming it is. The miners cabin is cozy and romantic, the hot tube are surrounded by nature and they are so hot and relaxing...! And the breakfast? Wonderful!<//review>

This absolutely wonderful place offers quant rentals, cute vintage decorated rooms, family style meals and a charming self-guiding walking tour of the surrounding buildings and history of the town of Benton. With perfect views of the White Mountains, there is much to learn, and enjoy while visiting. The hot spring tubs are clean, and the soothing water is untreated and fresh. The inn staff is warm and accommodating. I'll absolutely be back again! What a gem!<//Text>

Interesting historical spot. Individual hot water pools are top notch. Lack of RV hookups makes 4 instead of 5 stars.<//text>

We really loved this place. The ability to have your own private tub and pool your arvey right up to it was amazing. Even though there were others in the adjoining tubs we felt completely safe and had privacy. We are making Benton Hot Springs a must stop on our travels.< /text>

Well for one it's the hot dessert with a hot tub and not all the tubs have shade. Two tons of mosquitoes and bugs in general could not keep them out of our tent. Three there are rules no music, no being loud, you can only be naked in your tub and if you don't follow them they charge you $50 for disturbing the peace. It is a great place though if you want to not talk and be silent. SELF REFLECTION.<//Review>

The Inn has wonderfully decorated rooms enclosing a magical courtyard, the hot springs have amazing views of the White Mountains with a cottonwood tree above, and tasty breakfasts. The campgrounds are wonderful. We have stayed many times in The Old House--you walk into a set from the Old West, including a big comfy kitchen, porch with swing, and your own hot tub. The land here is gorgeous in every direction, with countless places to hike in the quiet gorgeous landscape. Bill and Diane are wonderful hosts. The memories of these trips sustain me throughout the year. Awesome!< /text>< Pictures>

Our second stay in the Bungalow - we thoroughly enjoy the setting, the accommodations and attention to detail.  the Bungalow is an eclectic, comfortable and nicely furnished spot to enjoy the solitude of this beautiful area.  The kitchen has all the cooking and eating utensils needed to enjoy your own cooking in this tranquil setting.  the hot springs tub is wonderful!< /text>

If you pass up staying here, you don't realize what your missing! So much more worth the cost than an unpersonable motel/hotel. Breakfast, beautiful landscaping, nature and natural hot spring tubs, to name a few perks. Thanks Jimmy Dale! The campground rocks too, you're guaranteed a private pool for each spot, each set up a different way. My husband and I "vacation" here as often as we can.<//Review>

Overall nice place, the camp sites are fairly private and we enjoyed our stay. The tub was far too hot (estimating 110)  and was tricky to regulate down, but we eventually got it. Staff friendly and helpful.< /review>

The Campsite at Benton Hot Springs is a piece of Heaven on Earth! The sites don't have electricity or water hookups, but come with their own private clean  HOT TUB filled with hot spring water. While soaking in the hot tub you have the most idyllic view of the desert Sierra Mountains in the backdrop. The star-gazing at night is also unforgettable! If you're driving from Yosemite to Las Vegas, this is an THE BEST night stop you could imagine!<//Text>

You'll have to make reservations way ahead of time, but this is a really cool place to camp. Make sure you discuss with the owners how to handle the tubs being too hot, as the water was way too hot for us to get in without plugging and letting them cool off.< /review>

Our party recently booked a stay with Benton Hot Springs and we were very excited to visit and rent the bunk house, however, our beloved Grandmother passed away within the 72 Hour cancellation notice and we had to cancel to attend her funeral.  Just be aware that this resort definitely does not 'pay it forward'  No exceptions, no refund.  We will not ever patronize them in the future because of this.  Sorry Benton you lost out on at least some future business.  Very disappointed that even the more dreaded part of the human experience isn't considered in their deliberation of 'policies'.  Overall, it may be a wonderful place, but customer service is CLEARLY not a priority for them.  So if customer service is important to you, perhaps avoid this place.< /Text>

We drove up, took one look and decided there was no way we could stay there So I went in and told the attendant..She said we had to pay anyway so it cost us one night's room rent.

The Inn appeared run down and there were no restaurants nearby as expected from reviews I had read.</text>

Made a reservation online 3 days ago. Called today because I never received confirmation either way and they said they were completely booked. I asked why they didn’t let me k ow that so I could plan accordingly and they said it says on the site it takes 48 hours. I told him it’s been 3 days. What a bunch of idiots. This is terrible customer service, pull it together.<//text>

<Review>I stayed at the Benton hot springs last week on my cycling journey across the west from Colorado to California. The people who work here are the most caring folks in the world. when I arrived, I had a huge cut on my left leg from a collision I had had on the road during the night. I didn't have large bandages to cover the wound, but one of the ladies who works at the inn drove 38 miles to the town of Bishop where's the nearest pharmacy to get the bandages, a saline spray, neosporing, and some gummy beans for me. she went way above what was required or expected of her, and she made a huge difference for me to be able to ride the next 300 miles to San Francisco. Theresa, you are my savior and my angel! I would not have made it to the end without you. I will pay your generosity forward to someone else who is in need, and will treat them with the same care and love you showed me. Thank you!</Review><time>1501011138753</time><rate>5<//rate>< username>

Most amazing place. Had the best time, hot spring tubs are so rad.. separate camping over to the side with own hot spring tubs. Sylvester the cat and everyone were the best. Breakfast was bomb! and i'm a super picky eater. Will be back asap !!

<review>They are very RUDE when you show up to see if you can stay or bath.  If you haven't paid them in advance they don't want to even talk to you about the place and coming back.  When I got home I read others (a lot of them) who had the same thing to say, RUDE PEOPLE!!!!  Then I also read about all the problems people who have been there have had with the bugs and bites and having to go to the Doctor.  When asking the staff there about it they were even RUDE about that too!  So I am really glad that we didn't get to bath or stay so I didn't have to be miserable with bug bites and a Doctor visit!  I have been in many wild hot tubs in many states and many pay ones also.  I have never been bitten or infected or had to go to a Doctor.  If they are this RUDE to customers then one can only guess at their "cleaning" of the tubs!!  This is one to take a pass on!!!</review><user_name>Nope Nope<//user_name>< Pictures>

AMAZING!!!!   Take a tent for sleeping. Tried just sleeping bags under the stars and bright moon and finally at 3:00 a.m. had to get the tents due to mosquitoes..... This was the ONLY downside.< /text>

Stayed here after a long day of motorcycle riding. The hostess was friendly and helpful upon our arrival. The hot springs were so relaxing after a long day on the road. The grounds are well kept with lots of nice little areas to hang out outside. They have a couple of nice patios and a barbecue for lunch and dinners. We stayed in the Marquessa Suite...the room has great charm, beds were comfortable and the room was clean. The TV had terrible sound but not a deal breaker. For those of you who care, the WiFi was very slow, but you cant complain since this is the middle of nowhere. I've stayed at other B&B's and the breakfast here was just ok. All in all I'm planning on staying here again as it was an enjoyable and relaxing time.< /review>

Remember to book whether it is a room or an RV place
For a 7-seater RV, each with its own spa !!
All with a breathtaking view!

The staff was very patient and helpful. They were very polite in all of our interactions. My daughter and I sat near the front desk so while waiting I observed the staff's interactions with all the other patients and I was very impressed with how they handled themselves in all situations. We were there May 12 in the late afternoon.< /text>

My 15-year old had an order and they made a very quick appointment. They even had available weekend appointments. The staff was kind and polite. The only reason they didn't get all 5 stars is that they tend to run way behind even with appointments. Otherwise, as a nurse and a patient, I highly recommend their professionalism and state of the art equipment.</Text>

SJ Imaging had nice employees, we forgot our paperwork from the doctor and the receptionist helped directed us to call the doctors office and have them fax it over which was super helpful! The wait was quite long and that was due to us forgetting the paperwork. Nice and quite place.<//Review>

The facility was busy. But you have to be patient. It wasn't bad of a wait the two ladies in the front we're very helpful friendly. Once I was called in the young lady that technician that get my cat scan she was awesome patient with me. Step-by-step what she was going to do made me very comfortable. I even took a nap during the procedure.</review>

I had a scheduled ultrasound. Every thing went smoothly. The tech was fast and amazing. Very professional.

But the person who made my appointment first scheduled me on a Wednesday and changed it to a Saturday because I needed a ultrasound and X-rays. But X-rays are only done on Monday through Friday. Now I have to come back another time. That is very annoying as I do not live close and it is a waste of time and gasoline.</Review>

I don’t think Walk-ins should be allowed because there are too many different imaging services.  I had an appointment, but I didn’t get in until an hour later.  The Dexascan clinician was very nice!  Janet Boyce< /text>

Friendly staff , clean and time-efficient.
My only critical concern is that there is no temperature checking, no social distancing and no # of people limitation.  However, there is a very few dividers in between chairs, there are chairs without dividers are very close to each other.<//Review>

The staff was very friendly. But the wait time was not. I was there for three and a half hours for a simple x-ray. The x-ray took literally five minutes. If the staff knew the wait time was over three hours it would have been nice to know in advance, so I could have chosen to come back when the wait time was less. Otherwise it was an okay experience.</Text>

I was even late for my appointment because the location of the  San Jacinto facility was very difficult to find. I was still provided my MRI even though I was late for my appointment. For anyone looking for this location, the building IS NOT directly on San Jacinto Blvd but sitting back behind other buildings. The facility is very big and located near the movie theater and a gym.<//review>< Pics>

Staff was polite and very efficient.  Wait time was not bad at all. Only issue is others within the office not properly masked.  I guess staff didn't feel the need to ask them to properly wear their mask.< /Review>

The people working there were nicer and more professional this time, and it was a lot quicker and more efficient experience.  However  some of the customers in the lobby were rude, oblivious,  lacking self awareness,   or just don't care about anyone else.  One lady had her phone turned up as loud as possible while texting multiple people,  and every 20 seconds a loud noise would go off. Another guy was on his phone in The reception area and talking loudly about what appeared to be a drug deal.  I cleaned my throat,  glared at both,  and neither gave me a look back. Lost in their own little worlds. I finally was about to loudly call both out when my name was called.  Saved by the bell, but what selfish A-Holes< /text>

Had to schedule an ultrasound, they Kept me on hold over an hour, no one bothered answering. Website wouldnt let me make an appointment until August because I'm not already in their system.

Update: 2 hours on hold no one bothered answering. Supposedly they sent my number to the manager for them to call me but no one has bothered. They're literally just a waste of time and don't take their jobs seriously.

Took 2 hours to make an appointment for an ultrasound, just for them to call me an hour before to say they had to reschedule.<//text>

There were patient in the lobby to the front door plus the waiting room was beyond crowded. Way beyond health standards. I waited over a half hour for my appointment. The technician was great but the front office staff reminded me of the dmv. Not good. Find somewhere else next time< /Review>

<review>I made an appointment for this office. 1 hour and half later I am leaving. They are really backed up. When I checked in I informed the staff I was there for CT scan and Xray. I wrote it on the strip ehen I checked in. However, when I was returned back for the CT scan I saw someone be called for xray who arrived way later after I arrived. When I went back to the front desk, she didn't check me in for the xray although I told her and wrote it down. She said my dr. Needed to order it. Which he did and she also overlooked. Not happy with the front desk staff. I won't come to this location again.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< gmapID>

Very clean, quiet and adequate social distancing seating and protective measures. Quick in and out, even though I didn’t have an appointment for X-rays. Staff is patient, kind and super efficient!  If you’re gonna be I’ll or I hired, this is the place to go for diagnostic imagining!  🙏🏽✌🏽💖</Review>

My experience at San Jacinto Imaging was great from the check in to the ultrasound. They made it very easy to fill out the paperwork online and text to let them know I had arrived and texting me back when they were ready. The technician was wonderful and kept the entire process very relaxed. My appointment was seamless and the front office was friendly and helpful!< /Review>

<review>The wait was way too long. Just as it has always been when I have been there before. The waiting area is way too small and always packed. No social distancing there. I waited over an hour. Also I am allergic to perfume and the place stinks of perfume.
A bad experience all around for me.</review><gmapID>0x80db68cf3f185461:0xbe976456233449c3</gmapID>< Time>

<Review>You are absolutely in great hands with the staff over at San Jacinto Imaging.   I was treated respectfully.  I was taken in for my appointment ON TIME.... which is very rare these days.   They offer on line registration which cuts your time in half.   The staff was amazing !

RESPECT to those who continue to hold the front lines solid during this pandemic... they are a rare breed.   Im terrible at remembering names
.. however I would love to give every single person working there a sincere thank you for treating me as a person and not a number !

HAPPY NEW YEAR GUYS !!!

Had to walk in to have a few x-rays taken today at San Jasinto Imaging Center. The folks working there were all very kind and helpful and got me in and out of there fast. I'd highly recommend using them if you find yourself in need of any medical imaging.< /text>

<text>This place lacks organization. I waited three hours to have my X Rays. The waiting area was super crowded. The chairs were not desinfected after people sat on them. I noticed at least four people cancelled there appointment after waiting over two hours. One young girl had to leave because her test was not done on time and her bladder could not hold the urine any longer for the test needed. This place needs to have more personnel and less people. It gives me the impression that what matters for this place is the financial gain not the well being of the patients. I will never come back.</text>< pics>

Staff was professional .
Don't know why with any appt still go to wait 1 HR and 30 mins seems unrealistic what is the point of an appt. See appt first then walkins would be managed better. Thanks you to the staff for their help . I understand its hard to work with public and you all do the best you can.<//Text>

Would not recommend this facility.  They are very disorganized and upon arriving noticed the facility was full of people who were sitting less than 3 feet apart, even though guidelines during COVID recommend being 6 feet apart.  Door to office was kept closed and it was so hot in the waiting area that it made it difficult to breath. (So I went to wait in the hallway) There just has to be a better system they can incorporate, like having people check in and then wait in their car until it’s their turn to be seen.< /review>

<Review>Folks in the actual imaging center were helpful, professional and nice. My appointment was on time and I was out after two procedures in less than 30 minutes. The only issue is the office was crowded and I didn’t witness any cleaning/sanitizing, there was only one hand sanitizer station in the entire office, that I saw,  and it was empty. There were no hand sanitizer stations in the main part of the building or near the doors. I saw two customers inside the building with no face masks.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures><user_id>110138337470532582324<//user_id></record></dataset><record>

The people that work at the imaging center are very nice. I would have rated it 5 stars, but deducted a star because I feel that everyone coming in should have had their temperature taken. There was social distancing, but I didn't see any hand sanitizer in the lobby. Also there was a man sitting across from me that kept coughing. Made me a little nervous.</review>

ASHLEY U.T.  was very kind and always had a smile, Noemi F.o. was very kind also helpful for all my questions. But the best one for last Mike MRI Tech .He was the kindness that I needed he listened to all my concerns and me with kids gloves  you see I'm very costropobid so he was always making sure I was okay and after checking that he would  put me at  ease  and  say something to make me smile.

< Review>
I had an overall okay experience. I was really upset with some of the staff not being professional. Example one: I didn't appreciate staff coming out into the waiting room where I was sitting  asking me about my diagnosis from a month ago. That was a huge HIPPA violation and somewhat embarrassing because the waiting room had a lot of patients in it. Example 2:  When I went in the back to get my Xray the female tech was such a crab and wouldn't stop asking me about my diagnosis details. I felt interrogated and uncomfortable like I was gross and bugging her with my existence. The two ladies at the front desk were awesome. One was training and doing a great job.<//Review>

Looks like they are overlooking or letting to many walkins occur. I didn't feel safe in this office. Not 6 feet apart at all and some chair are next to each other without blocking other person. My ultra sound tech was flvery sweet so was front desk. But they aren't being safe.<//Review>

It was a bit of a wait because I did a walk in appointment but they were able to not only do my x-ray  but they were able to get me in for my mammogram as well which worked out great for me. Didn't have to do another appointment.  Whew hew...

Front staff were extremely rude and not accommodating where I had to ask to speak to a manager. I called 3 days in a row to schedule an appointment to have X-rays done with no luck of anyone answering. The receptionist are rude and like to challenge and tell me things and it’s unexceptable</review>

I was running a couple of minutes late and the receptionist signed me in with no issues. I had a second trimester ultrasound and the technician was amazing! She made me feel comfortable and made the experience exciting. Because my husband wasn’t able to be present because of the COVID regulations, she let me FaceTime him  and he was a part of it too.<//text>

I had problems finding the suite number. Also, I was asked to bring in copies of my recent images. I spent 40 minutes of my time yesterday obtaining them and you didn’t need them, or want them. Also, first I was told that it was Temecula Imaging, then, I was told it was San Jacinto Imaging. When I walked into the building I went straight to the directory, neither of these names were on the directory. There was an imaging company on the directory in suite F. I couldn’t find suite F. Out of frustration, I almost left. Then, finally I found you. I felt pretty stupid when it was the first unit on the ground floor. It would have been nice if the name and suite number were on the directory.</Text><Pics>None< /Pics><response>{'time': 1606256923408, 'text': 'Thank you so much for the review!

<review>I have used San Jacinto Imaging for many years! They are very good! I do call ahead of time and try to figure out the best time to come in for the least waiting time! Also, if I can make an appointment! Those 2 things help to limit your waiting time!

They were very busy but I waited 3 hours for a 5 minute x ray. I got there before 12:30 and left at3:03. I have been to other places that don't take so long. There is no social distancing.  New policies should be implemented.  Last time I was there I also waited a long time because they forgot about me.  Paperwork was misplaced.<//Review>

The people are friendly and caring. X-rays can be painful for me but they were very careful and helped me with the painful positions. I would recommend them.<//Text>

Everything was good until I was waiting for the copy for the orthopedic doctor to look at. After 35 minutes I went up to the desks & asked about my disc copy. The girl said it wasn’t ready because nobody ordered it to be copied.<//text>

This is my second time here and both times were A+. The girls at the front desk are so nice and the techs are always sweet and accommodating. My daughter was cold during her CT scan and the tech gave her a warm blanket, it’s nice they have those available. Today she had an ultrasound and the tech was super helpful, I had so many questions during the process and she answered everything so well so I would understand. Thanks!!< /Review>

<user>112645118318560068079< /user><Review>Was instructed to text when I arrived (both via email and the signage at the door).  I did so and returned to my car.  Sat in my car for nearly an hour and never received a call or text to come inside for my appointment.  Had to call them to find out what was taking so long.  No excuse given was just told to come in.   Went inside and saw that the room was filled with people-what the heck?  I was under the impression I was supposed to wait outside.  After I entered the office it was fast and easy but clearly there is a problem with their check in process that needs to be immediately addressed.< /Review><name>Collette Busic</name>< Pics>

< Review>
I appreciated that they put up plexiglass barriers between the chairs (because of Covid). The receptionists were nice and helpful. The tech for my CT was efficient, but not a warm and fuzzy guy. He was okay and helped me through the process. The only thing that I didn’t like is that they told me to come at 9:45am for my 10:45am scan so I could drink the contrast an hour before. But they ended up just injecting the contrast right before the appt so it really wasn’t necessary for me to arrive so early before my appointment.</Review>

It was a smooth check in the ct scan was good n quick. The only thing I was not happy with is that no one sanitized the pens everyone e was using g and no chairs were wiped n sanitized after each person sat in them I'm very disappointed</Review>

<Text>Took a lot longer than I wanted to be there, 3 and a half hours for a few x-rays.  Would have been a lot nicer if I could have made an appointment.  Not enough room for social distancing, way too many people sitting in the waiting room.  Loved my x-ray tech, she was very nice and funny too!  Reception personnel could have been a bit more friendly!< /Text>< Pics>

If i could leave no stars i would. This place did not sanitize after each patient sat down, or counters touched or doors knobs touched. And they had many people in the waiting room not 6 ft apart and looked like they didnt limit the amount of people inside. Not Covid-19 friendly at all.</Review>

I went to San Jacinto  imaging today for an ultra sound. The staff was very professional and the lady that did my ultra sound was amazing. She made me feel very comfortable smooth environment. She helped me to relax with being in there office during this virus and crazy times. Cant rember her name but she was great thank you so much and God bless....< /text>

Everyone near me in the waiting room expressed the same dissatisfaction There is general frustration when it comes to X-rays.

They messed up the appointment time.  After signing in, we waited about 45 minutes and then they told me it was scheduled for tomorrow. I had called the day before to confirm that the appointment time was correct.  It was an extremely crowded small waiting room with about 20 people there (most wearing masks).  There was no social distancing.  I was told it was like this all the time.  Definitely a good place to catch COVID!  We decided to go to their Temecula branch on Sunday.  We were told that it was a bigger waiting room and was less crowded on Sundays.  We shall see.  I'm not totally blaming the workers...they looked overwhelmed.  Go at your own risk!  Just saying...<//text>

<Text>With an appointment for my OB anatomy scan at 20 weeks, the ultrasound technician saw me right away and was very thorough. I left with pictures of my little babe, a due date, and the gender. ☺️ Total time in the exam room was about an hour as she checked every part of the baby and womb, counted bones, etc. All the details of which will be sent to my doctor to review with me in a couple days.<//Text>< Pics>

< Review>
I just had my mammogram done and I’m very happy with my experience technician was polite friendly and courteous. Ladies we all know how delicate this can be she was very sensitive to the pain factor involved and didn’t overdo it with the squeegeeing involved.

I had to toe x-ray done right after that and they were ready for me immediately. Smooth transition from one to the other. Thank you to the entire staff from the operator who I made my appointment with to the registration ladies upfront when you get there to the technicians in the back everyone was polite, Professional, and Knowledgeable of their job doing it well I appreciate your time and they appreciate mine by doing their job the right way.
A big thank you to San Jacinto Imagine Center.</Review>

<response>None</response><text>11/12/2020 Kellie Cooper - Worst experience ever.  I had an appt for an ultrasound at 3:30, the scheduler told me to fast 6 hours prior to arrival.  When I arrived early at 3pm, the person at the front desk told me that it had been scheduled wrong.  I was supposed to have had 32 oz of water 1 hour prior to appt.  She made a phone call, said they could do it but I had to drink 32 oz of water, which she gave me.  I sat in the waiting room until 4:15 when an older woman at the front desk told me that they had to reschedule my appt because I missed my 3:30 appt.  The woman didn't care what another staff member had told me.  I also witnessed over two dozen patients come in for x-rays only to be told for the next two weeks, there will be no X-Ray tech available after 4:30 pm.  The staff at this office are the most Dis-functional, Un-organized, Un-Professional group of people and have absolutely NO business in the medical field.</text><userid>113874095333185199407<//userid><Gmap_id>0x80db68cf3f185461:0xbe976456233449c3</Gmap_id>< time>

The staff was friendly and helpful! However, I had to go in for a knee x-ray and I had to wait for almost three hours to get it done. The X-ray took three minutes. Maybe don’t come here in a time crunch<//text>

I went in for a routine mammogram. The technician was friendly and did her job with professionalism. The office itself was not properly socially distanced. Several chairs had been removed from the waiting area but the remaining chairs were ony about 3ft apart instead of the minimum required distance of 6ft.</Review>

The Technician was very nice, and kept me completely informed throughout the process. The MRI machine they use is not the typical cylinder that feels like a coffin. Instead, it's like a top and bottom hamburger bun, and you slide into the middle. This design allowed for looking around to either side, and was much more comfortable. The machine let's you know when each scan starts so you can be aware of how many more to go until you are done.

Now, the negatives. Really, only one negative, and that's the lack of headphones/music. It's not the end of the world, but during 40 minutes in the machine would have been nicer with some relaxing tunes.< /text>

They don’t allow appointments for X-rays, so there’s no way to gage when to go so you’re not waiting too long. They also don’t clean pens, chairs, changing rooms - anything that I saw - between uses! Changing into a gown for my xrays was very awkward. I was told to take everything with me because the locker key was missing and there was only a small curtain for privacy that did not reach from wall to wall. People were literally walking next to it/me while I was undressing! The whole experience was very uncomfortable for me - except the actual xrays. The tech was very polite and professional. No complaints there! Overall, I would not choose this facility again if I were given an option.</review>

The services provided by the actual radiologist were great . My issue is with the office staff , from the scheduling person ( Fabiola) being short and rude , she is in need of a reminder that her job is customer service. To the lady in the office as we are checking in being rude to her staff and my self . She kept making Snide remarks and comments under her breath as if we in the lobby could not hear her . All your staff needs a reminder that they are in a customer service job and they are there to service the customer . We are the reason they have a pay check . I would rather drive out of town than return here . I will make sure to share my experience with my medical provider and suggest they don’t refer people here .</review>

I had what I thought was a 10am appointment for an x-ray. Did not know it was first come first serve . The VES made the appointment for me and didn't tell me it was first come first serve. Other then that everything went well . Very nice and professional people work there.<//Review>

From the moment that I arrived, all the staff at San Jacinto imaging were very friendly and professional. The MRI tech was very professional and precise in how she placed me on table for the procedure. I'd give San Jacinto imaging 10 stars if I could. Terrific facility.<//Review>

To many people there in the office. The tech was super nice. They were not checking temp of people before coming in or anything.  It was fairly quick. The office people were ok not personal at all and dint wven crack a smile.</Text>

Walk-in for simple X-ray - no appointments are available for a simple X-ray..
Signed in at 10:55am...
Seen at approximately 12:22pm.  (87 minute wait)
There were 8 people "ahead" of me waiting on Valentine's Day.
Budget about 12 minutes for every person ahead of you.
NO APPOINTMENTS + 90-MINUTE WAIT = THIRD-WORLD SERVICE =
ONE STAR.< /review>

<Text>I have had scheduled three tests two times and was never advised that the venous test was an hour and a half long. The first date the venous test was at 8:00am and mammogram was scheduled for 8:30am. THAT IS A HALF OF AN HOUR!!! TODAY I WAS TOLD AT ALMOST 3PM THAT THE TECHNICIAN COULD NOT COMPLETE THE VENOUS TEST AS IT WAS AN HOUR AND A HALF LONG!!!!  NOT HAPPY AT ALL! Thank you...<//Text>< pictures>

My Down Syndrome brother had an ultrasound appointment.  So glad the actual technicians
are profession, efficient and also polite and courteous, they get 5 stars. Front desk staff, another tale.These people are so efficient, I can accept robots now. Professionally efficient but lacking any courtesy, compassion or politeness.  It is always a joy when we - clients, customers and patients - encounter people happy in their work involving public contact. Yes, obvious heavy client load,  so sour at 10?</text>

The young man doing x-rays was great. However, I was a bit disappointed that I had to ask for hand sanitizer after filling out papers on a clip board that looked like it would be hard to sanitize AMD only a couple of pens that they weren't wiping after. But my biggest complaint is that they list their hours as opening at 6:00am, but get there only to find x-rays don't start till 8:00am. Really! Say so when you publish times online!!!< /Text>

Turned away the 2 days prior because they were “too busy and there was a curfew order.” Terrible experience until I got in for a very efficient X-ray from the friendly technician. Tried twice to make an appointment, but they do not accept appointments for X-rays. Actually a terrible experience, ruining half my day for a 2 minute procedure. I will avoid this place at all cost unless they change their policy and allow X-ray appointments.<//review></record></dataset><record>

<Review>It's difficult to locate the suite. No exterior signage and small sign at door.
Staff is pleasant and helpful.
X-ray tech was professional, maybe a bit too much so ( stiff ).
Pretty punctual considering the number of people in the waiting room.
Good job, Thanks!< /Review>< pictures>

They office personnel was delightful and very prompt. The women taking the mammogram was very polite as well as the ultrasound sound tech. Front office staff could of been a bit less crabby. Other wise great fast friendly service.<//Review>

<review>This was our first visit to San Jacinto Imaging and they were professional and courteous. We had an appointment for an MRI, and also needed X rays. We didn’t wait for more than 10 minutes for the MRI, and the MRI technician was so polite and friendly. She really put my daughter at ease before her MRI, and afterwards. Then she arranged for my daughters X Ray, immediately following her MRI. So we didn’t have to wait, which was very nice. The entire staff provided good customer service.</review>< resp>

I’d give it 5 stars but the scheduling was a mess. Paperwork said 4pm but the appointments were 3:45 & 4:30pm which took 3 weeks to get (MRI). Staff was fantastic though and more than made up for it, they got me in after someone else then got my images on CD immediately. Ladies at the front apologized and the MRI tech (Melanie) was spectacularly sweet. Make sure you come 30 minutes early, even if you have been recently, they need time to check you in and are generally busier in the afternoons.< /Review>

Great staff but they need more staff on site to help. One admitting clerk 5-8 pm. X-ray tech looks tired. Even though this was the case they were very good at their jobs. Kudos to the staff.<//Review>

<Text>Unlike other diagnostics labs, it was relatively easy to get an imaging appointment. The young woman who did mine was competent, pleasant & caring. She knew how to do her job. Both ladies manning the desk were also competent & made the paperwork easy to complete. The imaging was done at the scheduled appointment time. Thus the 5 star rating! The report will be e-filed to my OB/GYN with 2 or 3 business days. It was a very easy & pleasant experience. Thanks to the staff there at the San Jacinto office. 👍👍👍👍👍</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

I've been a patient at this office for 3 years now. Every single time I came in,  I have gotten a 5 star service. From the moment I make my appointment, to the completion of my check up. The place is busy, but the people running it are well organize,  really knowlageble and fast.  All the patient rooms, restrooms and parking lot are well taking care of.< /review>

<resp>None</resp><text>Waited an hour and a half and seeing the entire waiting room clear out, then I went up to ask how much longer. New people had arrived by then, the nurse couldn't find my paperwork at first and I wasn't in the pile of the to be seen patients. She finally found it and as she went through all the papers she put my paper in somewhere in the pile and said there were three people ahead of me which wasn't possible when everybody was gone and I was there for an x-ray which is walk in only. So 2 hrs and 15 minutes after arriving I was finally called in.< /text>< Rating>

One receptionist had mask under her nose. Asked to put on proper she said it would not stay up. We were there for at least 90 minutes. Every time I looked her mask was below her nose. Many clients also had mask below now. No wiping down of chairs or spacing of chairs. Over crowded. Very disappointing and disrespectful of my health and others. Should not be open. From there we went to Quest for blood draw. Techs wore gowns, masks, and face shields. Checked temps. Cleaned chairs each time. World of difference.<//Text>

He was a saint) was such a pleasure to have had be my tech. he made me feel so comfortable, made me laugh and make sure I wasn't having a bad experience.

I waited three hours for a simple chest x-ray. They do not do apts. For x-rays. People with apts. Had to wait a long time to be seen. They really need to do something about this problem. We are all hurting and disabled or hurt and need to be seen sooner than what they do. This was my third time at this facility and it was the same each time. FIX IT PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!< /review>

I found San Jacinto Imaging to be both professional and efficient. The office staff was courteous and helpful. And since my appointment was early morning I found that to be welcoming. The Tech staff was caring and professtional. Which made the procedure comfortable and proceed in a timely manner. Overall, my experience at San Jacinto Imaging was satisfactory at every level of service.

My second visit to San Jacinto Imagining was a like the first. I can't say I like the walk in policy for x-rays but I understand it. And the staff are very efficient and promptly take arrivals. It is a very comfortable experience. San Jacinto Imaging has great client service. With excellent and caring professional staff.< /Text>

My experience with San Jacinto Imaging was very good, quick and easy. The office team really makes a difference in how a person feels when entering the office for treatment.
It was a comfortable experience.

They always call  and text  to remind me of my appointments , And if I stay just an extra five minutes at my appointment, they always provide me with a CD of any tests that I've had done which is awesome. I've been coming here for over 20 years... Hopefully they'll be here for me for another 20 years!< /review><Name>natalie nance< /Name><rate>5< /rate></record></dataset><record>

<review>I made my appointments online Monday afternoon for a mammogram and a Dexa scan.  Got lucky and had appointments for Tuesday morning (next day). Went for mammogram at 10:30, and when they noticed I was to co.e back in 2 hours for the DEXA Scan,they fit me in so I did t have to make another trip.  Everyone was friendly, knowledgeable and awesome.  Thanks<//review>< pics>

<review>This company denied me care and gave me a Ultimatum
This company tried to  bully me into getting an extra x-ray that I don’t need so that I could get an MRI done on my ankle this company claimed that it would be a safety issue for them to give me an MRI on my ankle was out doing an x-ray on my eyes because I had worked with metal in the past I explain to this company that I had just had an MRI done in a different location of my body and that I would sign a medical waiver so that I could receive services from them on my ankle they explained to me that I could either get the extra services done in which they would be billing my insurance or I could see care somewhere else  I don’t feel like a company should be able to choose which services they gift you I don’t believe a company should be able to tell me that I need extra services to receive the services in which I’ve been referred to them for I believe that any company that knew what they were doing would have a   Waiver in place  I even spoke to the manager his name is Angela and they also consulted with their chief technician who tried to assure me that being worried about exposure to extra x-rays was not a valid issue I’ve canceled my appointments and will be seeking care somewhere else and following up with someone else about this complaint</review>< pictures>

The waiting room is small but the ladies in the front desk were professional and promt. They really try to give extra assistance to the elderly and the disabled. The tech that did my mammogram was really nice, professional, and patient. I felt comfortable with her even though it was my first time having a mammogram done.<//text>

SJ imaging was very professional & caring about my safety. The technician was very helpful and you could tell that they were well trained professionals. I didn't have to wait an unreasonable amount of time.  I would recommend them to anyone needing a C.T. Scan or aM.R.I. .<//Text>

I prefer San Jacinto Imaging over other imaging establishments. San Jacinto Imaging has a  walk-in policy that allows me freedom in my schedule; I can show-up whenever it is convenient for me and they get my business; that makes it a win win situation for both.<//text>

<review>As the receptionists are the first ones you come into contact with, they could be more friendlier & professional. They both seemed tired. However the overall experience was good after waiting over a hour and finally asking receptionist how much longer when I observed others (who had arrived after me), being called in, and being told I was next’. I wondered if receptionist forgot about my chart.<//review>< rate>

I found my experience to be very pleasant. Staff was very helpful. My knee was hurting so after filling out forms the person at the counter brought my license and health card back to me so I didn’t have to get up. The X-ray tech. was very nice and encouraging to my problems also.</text>

My first MRI was great.. just a little long. My First mammogram was scared to death to have because I’ve heard so many people say how bad it hurts but Jana I knew I was in good hands and she made me feel comfortable and took her time and it ended up being a little uncomfortable but both techs worked awesome! Thank you so much !<//Text>

< review>
Waited in the waiting room for a total of two hours. One and half hours into waiting I went to the front desk and asked the lady how much longer. She began looking for my chart and could not find it. So she told me “ your chart is not up here, so the tech must already have it. You’ll be next” she said. After I sat down I seen 3 more people that came in after me which was actually 6 people in total that I seen come in after me get called to the back. Now I’m still waiting a total of 1 hour and 45 minutes. I go back to the counter and ask the lady “ out you sure the tech has my chart”. Then the lady in billing comes out with my chart, and says it’s right here. So the whole time it was in billing. After I signed a piece of paper, they called me back. So I spent about 2 hours waiting and the two X-rays took about 7 minutes. In all, horrible front desk service. I hate going to this office. This isn’t the first time I’ve been through this there</review>

<Review>This was my first time at SJIC. My experience was great. Even though there were a lot of angry,  rude and inpatient people, the staff never lost their cool. Now a days some people have no consideration or patience out in public. Its a little town with a lot of people...every place you go is a wait.  Be patient and respect the staff.</Review>< pictures>

Excellent costumer service and professionalism at the front desk, the Xray technology who identified her self as Maria, she shows compassion she understood that I was under a lot of pain.

Thank you all for delivering high quality patient care in San Jacinto!

I highly recommend San Jacinto Imagine Center.< /review>

I had a pleasant visit. The only thing is for just an x Ray I was almost there for an hour on a walk in.  It was. Perrty long compared to other places I’ve gone too. Also the x Ray technician female made me feel uncomfortable   She would not touch me at all when I couldn’t align my foot straight do to my arthritis.<//Text>

< review>
The front office staff is a joke. When initialing scheduling my appointment, the clerk asked if i wanted to go to a different facility. And after i told her that i did not know the locations of the other facilities, she continued to ask me if i was sure... Three more times.
Canceled my appointment and never told me. I just happened to call the day before to confirm and was told it had been canceled and now 'would I like to reschedule'. What do you think dummy?
Now at the appointment, I had to ask for my ID and medical card to be returned because the desk clerk never gave them back. Three different front desk clerks helped me, and not one of them knew what was going on, all of them clueless and asking each other what to do.
Once inside, the technicians were all great. Personable and friendly, excellent service. Too bad they have morons working the front.</review>

I felt very comfortable at San Jacinto imaging I was there for my appointment to have a mammogram and ultrasound. I found a lump and I talked with my primary care doctor he checked and felt the lump also.the people who work at San Jacinto imaging were so kind and understanding. Once I was called into the back for my examine I felt very at ease and comfortable. Just by the way they spoke to me was very considerate,respectful. And when they let me know how and what they would be doing for my exam, they were gentle. And gave a very beautiful smile.great place...</text>

This place is wonderful. The people are polite and are attentive to your needs. They are very fast yet take time to answer any questions you may have. When the nurse took blood, there was NO PAIN at all. That's a first for me cause it always gives me pain but here at San jacinto imaging, they do it and I don't even feel the needle go in!  I've been there twice and both times NO PAIN! THEY ROCK! GREAT JOB GIRLS!!!!!</Text>

The front staff was courteous and friendly. The technicians were professional and very personable. They made me feel calm and made my experience exceptional. The only negative thing is the waiting room is too small for the business.

My second most recent visit was not as positive as my first. I waited for 1 hour 25 minutes and still was not called for X-rays. I went to check and they still hadn’t even verified my insurance. She said they needed to call as they could not access their system. I was upset as I took time off work to be there. They called me about 10 minutes later and the X-rays took about 7 minutes. I will not go back to this place again. They obviously need more help and a better check-in process.<//text>

I had been here about a year ago and it was not so crowded. Also the waiting room furniture was worn down. I waited about 2hrs before I got my XRAY. I was a walk in arrived at 8:35 am finished by 11am. Clerks were polite just horrible wait time.< /Text>

Daniel was EXCELLENT! He was my CT tech September 2019. Daniel was kind, professional, and he calmed my anxiety, I don’t think I’ve ever had contrast before ,he made the exam so very very easy for me!! His assistant Curtis was also kind, patient and professional!! Would definitely recommend this imaging center to anyone!! As a matter of fact EVERY taff member I encountered was very kind ,polite and professional !</text>

< Review>
I had a 4 PM appointment for a ultrasound . I arrived at 3:52 pm .I waited until 4:26 to get my Ultisound test. Why tell people they have  a appointment at a certain time when they don't ? Do you double , triple book your appointments ? This office has a reputation for never being on time. They work people with no oppointments in .This screws up everything.</Review>

The reason I left a star is because they ask you to come a hour early and then they wait til your appt time before even giving what is needed unbelievable. However I give a 5 star to the techs who do the scan very courteous and have passion for what they do. I believe the girls up front need a lil more training and not just hanging out at the front desk like there's nothing to do.</review>

Very happy with the technician. I was extremely nervous about my MRI. He took time to talk to me about what will happen, how long it’ll take and what to do if I need to stop it. I survived my MRI!< /review>

<Text>First I would like to start by saying there is nothing social distancing about this place.  The chairs all close to each other.  I had a bone density test and the technician was not friendly at all.  I will give the technician who did my mammogram a 5 star rating because she was the most pleasant person in there.  Even the girl at the front desk  were not pleasant.< /Text>< response>

<Text>Hi, first of all I would like to say that ,I love the entire staff that works for San jacinto Imaging they work hard and they get yelled at a lot which in my opinion 90% of the patients  are just rude and impatient. Sometimes there are  unavoidable  problems due to the back of per se  the equipment broke or a patient  caused an issue  and with late and causes other people time there  of wait longer than normal and as x-rays are walking bases no pointment  which I do get one two days ago  and I was observing  many of the patients  and they were  very impatient and giving the staff girls upfront hard time  and it's out of their hands, and control that's like saying that humanity can control the weather, it's preposterous seriously people remember it's walk in basis 4 x-rays . Possibly there could be 500 people that walk in for x-rays so it's a patience  and sometimes way longer than anyone ever ejected because of that I've waited 2 hours before but I understand and it would be a blessing if all other patients were understanding is well with that's how life goes sometimes. And people read all about HIPAA laws so you don't go in with guns blazing for stuff you don't understand or read up on it start yelling at the staff and being absolutely ridiculous on your behavior. like I said it's not the front employees fault and they should not be treated so badly I'm just saying that they are wonderful I would rather go to them than any other Imaging Center, also Temecula are the only two places that I have no problems ever going for my procedures. the staff is very friendly all of them so I hope they get props cuz they deserve it thank you!</Text>< name>

Wait time was a bit long, but the tech was great. Took time to make sure the MRI scan for my daughter was clear and of good resolution to be evaluated with accuracy. Even took some time to show her some of the images with some basic explanations. She appreciated being treated with respect.<//text>

4/2021:  The mamogram was perfect, no pinching or smashing.  The tech is very careful but extremely efficient.  Anyone who says monograms are painful should come to San Jacinto Imaging,  They are great!

5/2019:  This place is very organized, I appreciate that.  The MRI Tech is very nice and he explained everything and gave me a CD when it was all done. I will go back if I need an MRI or Xray because they are so professional.  Thank You!</review>

Such an easy and quick appointment!! I love how this office works. Other offices (in Temecula) have you change into your gown and wait in the hallway with other patients until you are called. In this, more efficient and personable, office the technician calls you into the exam room and has you change right there and tests you immediately. The technician was super friendly and talked me through each step. Will ask to go there from now on.< /review>

The front desk employees were very nice. The ultrasound technician was kind and knowledgeable.  The only issue is that I couldn't find the entrance. It was very confusing because a dentist's info is on the main door so I didn't know it was the main door to the building. They need better signage.<//review>

<Text>Had three MRI’s done and it was a bit much for the three. My appointment was at 3:30 and I left at 6:30. But I had problems during my procedures and ultimately had to reschedule my appointment for one of them. But I would recommend them highly to anyone. They are wonderful to work with</Text>< Time>

Jan, the Mammography technician is F A B U L O U S!! im 57 y.o. & put off my 1st mammogram for 17 years now!! I was afraid of all the pain & discomfort i would have to go thru...BUT!...Jan was EXTREMELY good!! She explained everything & was understanding! Her professional manner was naturally gentle. I literally had NO pain watsoever!! We got all 4 views done & without any probs...the only thing i felt was a comfortable pressure but DEFINITELY NOT discomfort or pain!! Shouldnt ALL mammograms be like this, nice & easy?! She is a 1000 on a scale of 1 to 10!! I highly recommend her! I will have all future ones done by her & no one else!</text>

Really liked my image tech. She was warm and kind and made me feel very comfortable and relaxed.  However hated the waiting area filled closely to get the max with men as well. Sure missed my women's only peaceful waiting area. Also the wait was pretty long, about 45-55 min. If you change something, give women and men their separate areas. Tnx<//text>

Personnel was very professional. I was asked to be there at 1:15 for a 1:45 appointment. They finally called me back at 2:30. That was the rumbling in the very small waiting room. How long everyone was having to wait. I'm not sure how many complaining were walks in, or had an appointment like myself. Once I was with my technician that scan took about 10-15 mins. And like I said he couldn't have been nicer. The wait time is why I am leaving only 2 stars.< /Text>

Nice facility and very friendly staff. The wait was a little long, then after the imaging I had to wait an additional 30 minutes to get a copy on disc.<//Text>

<Rating>2<//Rating><Text>The rudest treatment I've ever received by a receptionist.it started off with the insurance, I was told if I couldn't pay the co pay the tests wouldn't be done. So fortunately, I had the money which was 24.80 but I handed her 25 which she shoved back at me and said I can't take that, it has to be exact amount, so I had to go across to a business that had change to accommodate.My question to you can Jacinto imaging is, do you treat all your patients like that, what if I was invalid and couldn't run go get exact change for your convenience? This is inexcusable, rude, poor business practice and I will NEVER BE BACK! Without our business you'd be out of business, so I suggest you reconsider your practices. Very unhappy customer.!</Text>< Pictures>

<Text>The staff there is very unhelpful and rude. I tried asking for clarification on a question on a form I was filling out, and was told "no" several times. The staff is very rude and unprofessional, and I do not recommend this place to anyone. This will be the last time I go here for any xrays, etc.  I wish I was able to not give any star ratings, but I HAD to choose 1 star, otherwise I would not be able to post my review.<//Text><resp>None< /resp><pictures>None<//pictures></record>

I was surprised by all people in the San Jacinto Imaging Center. But after sighing
the paper because I was new. They had me in and out so fast. And the staff and Radoligest
was so patient care and help me in every way.
So I definitely would go back.  Thank you I
give San Jacinto imaging Center, 169 two

Great experience! I drove 45 minutes to San Jacinto because I just can't do a closed MRI. This was the best MRI experience I've ever had. It is a Very open MRI and the tech did everything to make me comfortable. I had no anxiety and the music during the procedure was wonderful!< /Review>

Waiting room stacked
Not pleasant smelling
Many people complaining of the wait being too long.
My appt was for 1:10. I was called around 2:20
Once inside the exam room, I was told that they could only do ,1 yof the 2 tests ordered as they were not equipped.
So it would be best for me to reschedule for a different day.
I said No way, I did not drive all the way here, drink a quart of water and hold it for an hour to reschedule. Someone should have called me before I came
Do the test you can do
Reply from technician:
Well if I do one, you have to go back to your Doctor and get another request for the  other test.
Great!!!!
Really unprofessional people.</Text>

<date>1567543711804<//date><text>My experience today was without problem, timely & professional.   However, when I received my xray order on Friday, Aug 30, I called the number on the form, listened to the entire recording that including Sat hours. No mention of xrays not being available.   In addition, I went to your website to verify that you were open on Sat with hours listed. Again, no mention of xrays not being available.  I drove from my home in Idyllwild (approx 1 1/2 hours due to road closures from flooding) only to he told I couldn't have an xray. I told the receptionist their phone system and website said nothing about no xrays available on Sat.  She said she'd tell her manager. She gave me the Menifee location & told me their schedule was open & they were doing xrays.  I decided to call before driving there & listened to their message about being closed with office hours Mon-Fri....no Sat hours.  I returned home, very uneccessarily frustrated.
Please update your site phone recording & your website information regarding xray hours.<//text>< name>

There were over 20 people in the waiting room with no encouragement of social distancing. If I chose to wait in the hallway or lobby I would not have heard them call my name. Most people, including the staff were wearing their masks incorrectly.</Text>

I had a very nice experience getting the MRI of my brain with contrast performed at the San Jacinto Imaging Center. I was taking back the few minutes before my appointment time and explain the procedure by the technician which helped alleviate some of the fears that I had getting the procedure done. I would gladly drives the hour that it takes to get there from my house to get any further testing I need done.</Text>

Some days are busyer than others but still a good experience,,,,
Besides if they weren't busy I would think twice about going there because there would be a reason for nobody going there GREAT PLACE!😀</Review>< userid>

< Review>
Very nice office  staff. Wonderful tech who did mammogram. Gentle and caring.  Took away a star for their appointment staff. They apparently don't know the clinic's schedule and just make appointments.  My appointment was changed three times,  they called and rescheduled,  before I  finally got in. Wait time was about 20 minutes.
Fyi, mammograms are not done on Saturdays or after 4 .<//Review>

<Text>It would be great if appointments were taken but it’s only walk-in, I waited an hour and a half and my X-ray needed for work took 4 minutes. I was exposed to everyone’s coughs, colds, darling children and not allowed to wait outdoors..... and the people working here are apathetic and impatient. If I have a choice next year for my work xray I will go elsewhere.</Text><pictures>None</pictures><rating>2</rating><response>None<//response><Name>Wow Meow< /Name><time>1547586272979<//time><UserId.>111270327625268633894< /UserId.>< GmapID>

As apprehensive as I was, the entire MRI process went very smoothly and, seemed, quickly. I appreciated them allowing my husband in the room as well. I would not hesitate to return to this facility in the event future MRIs are indicated for me. All of the staff was friendly, courteous, and quite helpful. Thanks to all of you for making this a totally doable experience for me😊
Sincerely, Susan Washburn.< /Review>

My daughter waited over an hour past her appointment time to be seen. The receptionist then gave an excuse for the delay that made absolutely no sense.  Their lack of professionalism is impressive.</Text>

<review>I've been here at least 6x. Depending on when you get there, this place can be pretty busy. You need to ensure you have all your information with you, Ins info, I.D./D.L., etc...When they're busy, I find it best to occupy myself with a book, my smartphone or whatever you want to keep you from getting upset at the staff here bc there have been times when I've watched other patients that we're taken back before me, when I was there long before them!! Trust me, I had to go & ask when I saw this happen... it's bc they actually had an appt. For some procedures, you won't need to make an appt. They have the "first come, first serve" for the walk-ins. Overall, I find that if I'm kind & patient the experience is waaayyyy better for all. Namaste 🤗</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmap_id>

<Time>1543537787512<//Time><Rate>1<//Rate><Review>They made me feel as though I was a criminal trying to committ fraud. I had a 7:45 check in and inadvertantly forgot my id card. I had my typed referral from iehp AND my insurance card. The receptionist was going to cancel my appt. but luckily my gf had a picture of my license in her phone.
I did not get called in for my CT scan until almost 9:15 am. There were other people there who were noticeably upset due to the lack of punctuality on the part of this place.
The tech. who did my CT scan was quite professional and friendly. That lady in the front could take some pointers from him.
This place was terrible except for the tech.
I would rate this with ZERO stars if I could.</Review>< pics>

The wait was pretty long, and then they charged me $50 for my co-pay, I kept telling them that I didn't have a co-pay for Xrays, and they kept telling me I do and I had to pay before they would do my Xrays, everything went good after I got called to go back, but when I was ready to leave an employee stop me and told me to stop at the desk for a refund, I wasn't suppose to be charged for Xrays.<//Review>

My 13 year old daughter has an appointment tomorrow 05/26/2015 for a MRI due to some type of seizure disorder. I really hope and pray that our appt is not bad as the reviews I just read. I will be back to give my review on our experience. I need to know what's going on with my daughter and these out of the blue seizures that started March 2015. I rated a two because of the comments I've read. I'll be back to give my final review.</text>

< Review>
This place is badly organized. All x-ray are walk ins no appointment affered. I waited one hour and 45 mins. While waiting someone I know walked in also for x-rays. This person was seen before me. When I asked they said I was next and did not know what happened. Theysais they were barely checking me in and that they  work people in the order they come in. Obiously that is false. They are just careless<//Review>

They apologized to us and we finally went in  for our procedure took ten minutes, we waited nearly from 0745 to 9:20.  Our appointment was 8.

I went in one day and sat there for 30 min waiting for them to check me when they finally called me up and saw what I needed they let me know then that the X-ray machine was down , it would have been nice if they had asked me before I signed in what I was going to have done so I didn't have to sit there for 30 minutes. I went in the next day and it was fixed, still had to wait a while.</Text>

Have been scheduled TWICE for a mammogram and ultrasound only to discover that the technician was not even available on either day.  Did not receive a call to tell me to reschedule.  Cannot imagine a facility being this poorly managed.  Meanwhile I have experienced several sleepless nights worrying about what could be wrong.<//review>

The ladies at the front were awesome very considerate. Even tho the waiting time was very long. But the lady who did my. Scan. Was disrespectful degrates me. And a mistake on paper was rude about it. And Basicky telling me I don't have is two. She don't know that. Also said I've never been diagnosed with it. Hmmm really . I've done this before and was .so has my deceased mother my sister. Grandmother. I did tell the ladies up front about her. I was in tears how she treated me. And she walks up behind me smiling about it.< /review>

Horrible experience there.  Had an MRI done after a car accident in 2016.  Overcrowded, poor service.  They forget about me after I signed in.  You need an appointment for an MRI.  I knew I already had a torn meniscus on my left knee from a previous injury, taken at California Imaging & Diagnostics.  It was bad enough where my doctor told me, it would NOT heal without surgery.  That said San Jacinto imaging said my knee was perfectly normal.

The state of the MRI machine itself looked very banged up and old.  That's fine, as long as it works.  I believe both the machine and medical staff there are incompetent and would advise EVERYONE to stay away from there!!!</Text>

Never coming back here everytime I come they are slow as heck. Staff doesn't even know what's going on everytime I ask how much longer they walk away then say there's so n so ppl a head of you. Doesn't diserve a star.<//text><Name>Sabastian Kimball<//Name>< rate>

My mother had a 1030am appointment.  It's now noon and we've been here since 1010am. This is ridiculous. Worst service ever. They crossed out her name and took someone else ahead of her and now we're stuck waiting as though she were a walk in.< /Text>

<Text>The  front staff was very rude. I was lied to the woman behind the desk (elderly) kept complaining to the younger receptionist  beside her. Total lack of communication  with customers, it seemed as if they only wanted to complain about their employer. Overall that was the lonest wait I've ever had it seemed as if no one wanted to be there<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><gmapID>0x80db68cf3f185461:0xbe976456233449c3< /gmapID></record>

Horrible place I'd find a new place to look into because when I went to temecula I was in before my appointme.</Review>< resp>

Then they told me they couldnt see me because they never got the fax from the Doctor. You would think with me waiting so long they would call for me and have them fax it.

(Translated by Google) The staff took great care of me ...
What I did not like was that there were a lot of people in the waiting room and the chairs were not 6 feet away and that seemed to me that they are not taking things seriously and being a clinic they should set an example for the community I hope and become aware and do something ...
Personally I would not make an appointment in that place better waited for me until they have an appointment in my regular clinic ...

(Original)
El personal me atendió muy bien...
Lo que no me gustó fue en la sala de espera había mucha gente y no estaban las sillas con 6 pies de distancia y eso me pareció que no están tomando las cosas en serio y siendo una clínica deberían de poner el ejemplo a la comunidad  espero y tomen conciencia y hagan algo ...
En lo personal yo no volvería a hacer cita en ése lugar mejor me esperó hasta que tengan una cita en mi clínica regular...</review>

<Review>(Translated by Google) They are some despots who attend, I think they are the owners of the place or rather they believe the great thing, it is a shame that despite dealing with people who are sick they have to treat us as if we worked for them, apart they are well useless hurts people.

(Original)
Son unas despotas las que atienden, yo creo que son las dueñas del lugar o más bien se creen la gran cosa, es una vergüenza que a pesar de tratar con gente que estamos enfermos nos tengan que tratar como si nosotros trabajáramos para ellos, aparte son bien inútiles lastima de personas.</Review>< Pictures>
