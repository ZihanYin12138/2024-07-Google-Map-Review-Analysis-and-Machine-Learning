Great ribeye steaks and happy hour appetizers!  The clam chowder is delicious.  It has the perfect balance of potatoes and clams.  The real clam broth brings it to perfection.  The seafood Fra Diavlo is very good and my wife's go to order.  I love their ribeye steak with the peppercorn sauce.  The sauce is the perfect complement to the juicy tender steak.  The servers aim to please,are  very attentive, and gladly provide recommendations if you can't decide what to order.  All in all an excellent dining experience.<//Review>

Could benefit from a bit more seasoning on the peppers and onions, though steak was pretty good. Recommend the corn muffin if given a bread choice, makes for a tasty "dessert" with butter and honey.< /Text>< pictures>

<Review>The food and service are great. This cafe is attached to a hotel, so it serves guests, but the general public is welcome which is what we do. I love the salad and cornbread muffin that come with the meal. There is a good selection of food on the menu and everything I've tried has been delicious! A gem!</Review><Time>1580398190043</Time><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Gmap_id>

We should have come sooner. I don't know why we have never tried eating at Point Loma Cafe before. I drive past it all the time but I never pulled in to try it. What a mistake that was! Inside is clean, spacious and nicely decorated. The food was unexpectedly tasty and our waitress, Bing, was a delightful lady who we hope serves us again next time. TIP: try the cornbread muffin, it is so good we even ordered another one to bring home with us.<//Review>

Food is ok. Not super salty like most diners. Very pricey though. $5 for bacon. Service is very slow as well. Very quiet atmosphere though. Good for breakfast. Probably won't go again.<//Text>

I can not thank Lynn and Omar enough for handling our small little party we had here for my son’s birthday dinner last minute ❤️ everyone loved it so much and the food and service was amazing as always! The patio is perfect if you have kids because they have a beautiful grassy area for them to play so you can enjoy your drinks and delicious fare :) thank you and see you soon!<//Text>

This is a comfortable spot with an outside pool and garden. The overall food and service is pretty good. Staff is friendly and welcoming. We ordered the spicy chicken wings, which had a spicy sour flavor, and the sauteed chicken breast and pasta, which was great though I could have done without the sun-dried tomatoes they put in it. Items are a bit pricey but the final bill was just around $21, thanks to our passport unlimited discount. Would recommend this place if you're looking for a peaceful lunch. Doesn't seem to have a lot of visitors, seemingly hidden by the Holiday Inn hotel it's a part of.</review>< Rating>

<Text>Expensive and no flavor. Pay $15-20 for the most white-washed, boring food you'll ever have. Salad was some spinach, fruit and a touch of honey. Pizza was white flour, sauce from a can, and mozarella. Disgusting. I threw half away.

This place had nothing but seniors there - who probably don't care or can't tell the difference. Clearly it's a place for seniors to go and sit and talk with the staff for 2 hours over a bagel and cup of coffee. For anyone who likes good food, STAY AWAY. 10,000 better places for cheaper in San Diego.

+1 star for the nice but overbearing staff.<//Text>< pics>

<Review>At first I thought this would be a happening little, local lunch spot by external appearances.  Don't be fooled, it's part of the hotel which it fronts.  Nothing 5-star about this place.  Food was blasé but edible.  Far too expensive for a simple lunch menu.  And I ate at the bar!  Oh well, mistakes happen.  Gets three stars because the service was actually decent, but not great.< /Review>< pics>

Nice, comfortable restaurant. Very good breakfasts. The best thing about the place is Irene. She is the best waitress and is exceptionally funny! She made our meals much better with her attitude alone.<//Review>

<Review>I don't normally do this but I felt the need to put a review for this place firstly the service was slow and bad at response when we started to get our food only one person got theirs and then the other on top of that the food was bland or the flavor was off as well the Margaritas we had were improperly made finally it was expensive for our food
Only good factor is the place was near empty
We got
Margarita 2
Shrimp pasta (with small shrimp)
A burger with fries
And a salad
Total 61.67

Revisit
We decided to head back after a recommendation from someone for breakfast and I must say the food for breakfast is very good with large portions they did redeem themselves so all in all good place for breakfast just don't go to the bar.</Review>< Resp>

If you stay at the hotel, they give you meal tickets.  With 4 kids and myself, my tab was incredibly low.  I would GLADLY pay full price.

My kids loved their meal.  Irene is a great server.  Massive compliments to the chef.  Prost.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

This restaurant is actually (kinda) attached to the hotel, but that doesn't seem to matter. The food is pretty good hear, and they did a good job to make the place look classes. Employees are very nice and tentative. You still kinda get the feel that it's a restaurant hotel, but if you can look past that you won't have any issue with anything else.<//Text>

<review>Food came out cold, portions are small for the price and biscuits and gravy taste gross. Have eaten here for many years and quality has dropped consistently as price increases.

Came here on a Sunday early morning breakfast. Person at register was also the host, waitstaff, server, etc.  She was the only staff at the time waiting on customers. Props to her because she had service with a smile and didn't miss a beat. Will come here again when visiting the San Diego area.< /Text>

This place is a restaurant hanging off of a hotel name brand. Its actually pretty good. Its not a standard kind of holiday inn reaturant, in fact I don't think I've ever stayed at a holiday inn that had a resteraunt. They have the best Maui Maui tacos in the world. I tried it for their dinner special and almost fell out my chair because it was soo good. Th3 staff was friendly and very welcoming.</Review>

< Review>
The breakfast here is good. Been coming for years but the service is not good. Servers are hit or miss.  They serve very small portions that is not in line with the high prices. Cafe gives a nickel and dime aura which is not appealing at all.</Review>

They're pupusas are definitely best in town. My fave is revueltas. They are meaty and cheesy. The only reason They're not getting their 5 stars is because of the service. The owner needs to work on his customer service skills</Text>

<Review>Want to eat something different.  Try this restaurant. There pupusas are really good.  Not to mention there fresh water and there chicharrón plate. Add that to your order and you'd be happy. Ofcourse right now its carry out only. Order through phone and pick up in less then half hour. Hot and ready to eat. Brought to you by Realtor Tomas< /Review>< username>

The pupusasa are good, delicious even, they're a little over priced. Sometimes the staff is rude other times they're alright. Weird, but I'm there for the food, to bad they couldn't hire people with better attitudes< /review>

Delicious food! Wonderful cooks! Great customer service! A year ago I had an inconvenience with my order, but they corrected the error and improved in customer service (I understand that it was very busy that night)...So if you want to try Delicious Authentic Salvadorean food, this is the right place!< /Text>

<Review>Read this place on yelp and decided to give it a try.  When walking in the server was sitting down watching a soccer game.  I said ok,  I'll let it slide.  We then placed our order and about 10 minutes later our food came out.  I was impressed.  The food was great tasting and delicious.  Made to order and we'll worth the money.<//Review>< name>

I really like their pupusas. It's hard to find good quality pupusas and this place is definitely it.  It's a small chill place for those nights that you don't feel like cooking but need something quick</Review>

Good food . Just dont go in expecting your food to be served quickly. Food takes a while to be made. Call in advance if you do not want to wait a while.</Text>

<text>(Translated by Google) This pupuseria is very good, I do not think the combination of pork rinds with cheese can be spoiled, anywhere I have eaten them, they are not bad. The dough was very well kneaded, and the pupusas were not greasy. I took the big ones, why not ?, and they were delicious and of course I got fed up until I couldn't, I couldn't stop eating, but, that happens to me frequently, hahahaha. The only thing that if I ask for more, it is more spicy in the sauce and in the tanning. The tomato sauce, tasted of tomato and its spices, I need a kick to kill the acidity and sweetness of the tomato. When tanning, throw a handful of arbol chili peppers, that's all I ask. But that doesn't take away any stars. I recommend this place!

(Original)
Esta pupuseria esta buenísima, no creo que se pueda hechar a perder la combination de chicharrón con queso, en cualquier lugar que las e comido, ninca estan mal. La masa estaba muy bien amasada, y las pupusas no estaban grasosas. Agarre las grandes, porque no?, y estabieron deliciosas y claro me harté hasta que lla no pude, no podia parar de comer, pero, eso me pasa frecuentemente, hahahaha. Lo unico que si pido mas, es mas picante en la salsa y en el curtido. La salsa de tomate, sabia a tomate y sus especies, necesito un kick para que mate la acidez y dulce del tomate. Al curtido,  avientele un puño de chiles de arbol, es todo lo que pido. Pero eso no les quita ninguna estrella. Recomiendo wste lugar!< /text><Pics>None< /Pics><Date>1609945803835<//Date>< rating>

<Review>(Translated by Google) Unfortunately it was not what I expected, not only because I thought that having the name of our national bird could have the authentic Salvadoran flavor, but it was a shame and despiration, I asked for an atoll of corn that looked like water, made of cornstarch, milk and corn scraped, in super dirty and very bad to see, the typical dish an inch of cheese and a teaspoon of butter, what a shame as they serve with lack of poverty and super expensive, I do not weigh to pay whatever it is when it is all quality, but when they insult the authenticity of a true Salvadoran by giving cornstarch atole by corn I give it two stars and without deserving it, I was really generous because they do not deserve it.

(Original)
Desafortunadamente no fue lo que esperaba, no sólo porque pensé que por tener el nombre de nuestra ave nacional podría tener el auténtico sabor Salvadoreño, pero fue una vergüenza y desepcion, pedí un atol de elote que parecía agua, hecho de maicena, leche y elote raspado, adentro super sucio y de muy mal ver, el plato típico una pulgada de queso y una cucharadita de mantequilla, qué vergüenza como sirven con carencia de pobreza y súper caro, a mi no pesa pagar lo qué sea cuando es todo de calidad, pero cuándo insultan la autenticidad de un verdadero Salvadoreño dándole atole de maicena por elote le doy dos estrellas y  sin merecerlo, fui generosa en realidad porque no lo merecen.</Review>< userid>

(Translated by Google) If I could give you zero stars, I would. I am having breakfast in this place and they serve me a coffee when I add the milk they look like white lumps. I let them know they take out the coffee and they spend 20 minutes and they did not offer me a new coffee, I call the guy who is taking care of me and he tells me that the milk is over. OMG 1.osea I was served a coffee with expired milk
2. They never came to replace him
3. They did not offer a new drink

How a restaurant can open its services without checking the expiration of its products
We need the health department

(Original)
Si podria darle cero estrellas lo haria. Estoy desayunando en este lugar y me sirven un café cuando le agrego la leche se miran como grumos blancos. Les hago saber retiran el café y pasan 20 minutos y no me ofrecieron un nuevo café, le llamo al guy que me esta atendiendo y me dice es que la leche esta vencida. OMG 1.osea me sirvieron un cafe con leche vencida
2. Jamas vinieron a reemplazarlo
3. No ofrecieron una nueva bebida

Como un Restaurante puede abrir sus servicios sin checar el vencimiento de sus productos
Necesitamos al departamento de salud</review>

(Translated by Google) The worst place I've ever been ... The guy attends as if he were asking for the food as a gift, and seafood cream is served with spoiled product, if you're reading this, DON'T GO! I'm saving you from getting diarrhea for about 3 days, and I'm not kidding.

This place has great deals and the foos is healthy. For what you pay you get big portions where other places give you super small portions. Highly recommend this place as it is a small business and the food is good. Come check it out< /review>

Lobby is very clean and the workers are very polite! Everyone seems to be on top of their duties. Love the deals when ordering online! I will definitely continue to order through the app. The app has easy to follow for directions especially for first time users. Will be coming back!</text>

<Review>This place is great! Always has fresh ingredients and tastes great. You can get their Açaí bowl blends as smoothies, my go to is the Hawaiian as a smoothie.
Bonus they sometimes have MotoGP on, which is super rare and love coming in to see Rossi battling it out at Laguna Seca! 10/10 plus I just redeemed my points for a free smoothie! Make sure to put your number into the kiosk!< /Review>< Rating>

The acai bowls were made fresh and for a reasonable price. The cashier was also very nice and helpful when we were ordering. I ordered the Tahiti with agave. They have authentic Brazilian snacks that look super fresh.< /Text>

My favorite acai place! Always fresh fruits and acai blends taste delicious. 😋 you can find acai blends according your preferences. I like São Paulo and Cali blends! With condensed milk, hemp hearts and cacao nibs it’s a boooomb!! Also they have topping Tuesday with 3 toppings for freeee! 🤩
When I’m hungry I’m ordering beef empanada with hot sauce. So yuuummmyyy!
If you want to save time and money you can order online with code: STAYHEALTHY
Employees are always very nice and friendly!

#1 place to visit any time! 💖</Review>

I've been going there for years. Previous owner gave me honest attention and I felt that I can always trust. New ownership seems to lack all from the previous ownership. I give all businesses a chance regardless of ethnicity of ownership. But, I admit that as a Mexican, I look forward to support Mexican ownership. However, that didn't seem to help here as I received a sub par service and attention. He seemed bothered and I witnessed owner ignoring me as I went for a follow up, walked right in front of me to greet another white client with a pleasant attitude I have yet to see from him. I was originally filled with freon at the highest price ever, but told me he wouldn't charge me if I needed refill.
Turned out, I ran out of air a day after in a long hot trip where my daughter vomited twice because of lack of air.
I returned to have it checked again and charged me an additional $600 ish over the phone for a new compressor, so I declined. He later called me for a lower price, which I accepted, but turns out that he included another gas recharge. He told me that he just put that in as paperwork.
Note that when they called when the job was done, my wife dealt with it and they tried charging her the $600 plus amount.
I'll see if give them a second chance. But, I wasn't thrilled about his upset offer to solve our disagreement by offering to replace the bad compressor back into my truck.< /Text>

Keep in mind that you are not obligated to pay for any service you don't want. We informed you that the freon would not last long if the car had a leak in the a/c system. Any decisions you've made when you left was at your own discretion. In regards to the follow up visit, we offered a $100 discount and would include the freon on us. As you stated earlier it ran out, therefore new freon was needed for the air blow cool again. Customers are entitled a detailed receipt of the work performed on their car hence the paperwork.

I had to review this place  because it was just a pleasant experience, minus the fact it was a baking hot day so it was a bit warm in the lobby I mean everything else was just a pleasant and friendly day. Jose was the mechanic that helped me and even down to giving me an ice cold drink and filling me in a couple of times during my repairs ànd checking on my well being they made me feel like family.. highly recommend this auto repair shop.. and you just can't find that kind of service very often....<//Review>

<rating>2<//rating><Text>I have been going here for years. They have new owners. I asked for a system flush and replace upper and lower hoses. I supplied the hoses. The mechanic replaced the hoses and added antifreeze without flushing the system and i saw that he did not have the upper hose properly fitted. I asked him to fit the hose properly and he did. He said antifreeze looked good. But my point was I wanted the system flushed. They do not take credit cards and only cash. If they continue to do business this way I'll find another place to go to.</Text>< pictures>

<Text>I have come here 3 times over the past 5 years and they have done a fantastic job on my 1991 Lexus LS400. The first 2 times dealt with an air conditioner issue, the third the water pump, radiator reservoir and radiator. During the water pump install I had Paul’s crew install a new timing belt, serpentine belt and anything else that had to do with the inside engine, water pump area, wear and tear. My 22 year old car in 2013 runs smoother and quieter.

Paul and his crew did an excellent job at a great price. He’ll use only the highest quality parts and guarantees all of his work. This is a great place to get all of your air conditioning, heating system and general engine repaired. Paul, the owner, is super honest and will not do any unnecessary repairs. A place you can trust to get the job done right at a great price. I highly recommend the Radiator Depot & A/C Specialist.<//Text>< Gmap_id>

Radiator Depot fixed my AC wonderfully! And fixed an issue with my poorly installed fan system, which made my car so much quieter. I'm so delighted by the service and work done. I expected to pay much more!< /Review>

""""These first 8 lines added on 8/17 (for honesty) as an update for my review , so the place returned me back my money (the $80) after I called them again and tell them that it wasn't a fix or appropriate to deal with a customer so they did at least better than nothing ( the suck their freon back from the compressor though, but still wasted my time""'""

Don't ever go to this place
It's totally untrustworthy.
He simply have no experience at all and he ripped me off. He took $80 for nothing at all.

I went to him he checked  the car and he ordered the part needed to be replaced (I gave him $120 deposit as he asked with a good intention that he knows what he's doing) after 2 days the part was delivered so he called me I took the car to him he started working on it told me it's going to take couple hours then after coples hours he come and told me I have to leave the car till tomorrow because he wasn't able to figure  what is the problem!! and although it's frustrating and waste of time I told him that I'm going to take my car and come back in my day off, then he start talking more he said he ordered the wrong part but he said in fact he doesn't even know which part he should order (I think he ordered a used or refurbished part that does not work although he said he's ordering a brand new part and I'm saying this because it says Toyota genuine part and I have searched this part if it's the Toyota genuine and it way more expensive than his total estimate)  , and after couple minutes talking he tell me I didn't work on your car model before and you better take it to another shop(my car is a 2007 Toyota Camry) there are millions on the road . He told me I'm going to return the money to you and I said okay but now he's telling me like I have to charge you $80(return $40 out of my $120 I paid him as a deposit) for what? He didn't even know what's going on with the car so he didn't even diagnose it he is the one that doesn't want to take the job and he still want to charge me.
He simply have no experience at all and he ripped me off....
Don't go there .
You might be lucky but you might get screwed he have no experience and he would want to charge you still... don't pay for diagnosis or deposit till the job is done if you go there but it's better not to go.
Don't deal with him with good intentions till you get the job done and you check yourself.
I warned you !!!!</review>

<Review>A few days ago, our car had a busted radiator that we could jerry-rig decently enough to drive short distances. Took it to two different shops, both told me it had to be replaced, got quotes from 5+ shops on a radiator replacement... Paul beat them all by at least $200, and up to $500. Went in and he asked me what he quoted me, and being an honest man I told him the exact price he told me. He ended up charging me exactly that price (plus tax, but that's to be expected), while getting the work done in under an hour on a Saturday afternoon. Definitely going to recommend this place to anybody who's having radiator issues; Paul's honest, great work at great speed and great prices deserves to be widely-known.<//Review></record>

<Review>I have been to Radiator Depot several times and each time has been a joy. Paul is honest and knowledgeable, and their prices have not been matched by anyone I’ve ever seen.
Today I paid $85 for what another mechanic called a faulty ac compressor and quoted me $900 for! Paul quickly realized the other mechanic was wrong and had me out of there in 30 mins. Cold air from my vents again!< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None</response><gmap_id>0x80dd27f3e638c3db:0x638406a92d8b247e</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

< review>
Paul is amazing and and honest mechanic. I had a coolant leak in my car and was quoted from the dealership $800 for a brand new radiator and water pump for my mustang. Took my car to get inspected by Paul and he noticed right away that the cause of the leak was a small hole of the reserve tank. All he needed to do was get a new part from the dealership that only costed $85 and a coolant flush. It all costed me around $200 which saved me $600 right off the bat. I am very thankful for Paul and Radiator Depot for their honesty and amazing customer service/knowledge.</review>

<text>Nice gyms with great indoor facilities. There is multipurpose room for dance. Multipurpose court for basketball or other ball game. Fitness room for workout and swimming pool. You can also rent many equipment like basketball, towel, racket ball for free. It’s free for CALTECH student. Should use it more< /text>< pictures>

<text>This is a great gym option if you are affiliated with Caltech or JPL. The membership is paid by month so you're not locked into any contract. The price is fantastic, $35 per month which beats any other nearby gyms.

There are facilities and equipment for pretty much anything you need. My favorites are the open weight areas, the rock climbing wall, and the track field.

The only downside is some indoor areas of the gym do not have AC. They're cooled by giant industrial fans.</text><user_name>John Patton< /user_name><Resp>None</Resp>< Time>

They recently updated many machines, the weights room area is clean and organized.  Good place to work out.  2 good sized pools, indoor basketball and racquetball courts.  The area for improvement are the locker rooms...showers are very dated and old.< /Review>

The management of the facility is the exact opposite.

Given that this is an academic facility, it is ironic that student athletes are given minor priority.
The main focus in this facility appears to be about making money.

The equipment is good, but overcrowded and TV screens blasting everywhere.

Sad :-(<//text>< user_id>

Good facilities, less crowd. But you need to get in to Caltech to use it free of cost.< /Text>

(Translated by Google) Nice sports center! Several gyms, many tools. Short but valid pools for swimming a little. Good prices for subscription.

(Original)
Bel centro sportivo! Svariate palestre, molti attrezzi. Piscine corte ma valide per nuotare un poco. Prezzi buoni in caso di abbonamento.< /Text>

<text>Leased an office for two years. Had a really great time here. My office faces Greenland Metropolis and the I-10 Freeway. Fantastic view, especially at night. Titán staff are very polite and friendly. Liked the tea and coffee that are provided free to tenants and visitors. Donuts remind me of happy Fridays. Feeling sad I have to leave because my project is over. Will definitely consider Titan if I come back for new projects in LA.<//text>< Pics>

<user_id>114009199092538948745<//user_id><Review>i have been meaning to write this review for quite some time. We met with the owner Edwin and manager Rebekah to tour the facility in November.  It was a great experience with top notch amenities.  Pricing was extremely reasonable for the location and all the services offered with the space.  Views were amazing.  Both Edwin and Rebekah were very quick and responsive.  I would highly recommend for any small business looking to impress.< /Review><date>1580254516002</date><Pics>None</Pics></record>

<review>Edwin and his team do a fantastic job. Not only are they professional and competent, they're friendly and fun. Moreover, everyone else in these executive suites feel the same. The negative reviews are from competitors or losers. These are well run executive offices, with amazing views. The space is also sparkling and brand-spanking new. You will not find better offices unless you are willing to pay an arm and a leg!< /review></record></dataset><record>

<Text>I love running my business here. I have had so many issues with my previous landlords and for once I can say it’s been two years of a great experience. Rebekah at Titan has helped me so many times and my clients love the receptionists. Fredy has always come through with my last minute chaos. Generally, everybody is like family to me at this point. I highly recommend Titan Offices for anybody looking for a long term relationship oriented business office. Cheers to many more years of great experiences! 🍾< /Text><Resp>None</Resp><UserId.>110302298212015678321</UserId.>< user_name>

I have been leasing an office space for about two years now and I have been thoroughly impressed with the management, cleanliness, attentiveness and professionalism of the Titan family. They take care of my needs immediately. I would highly recommend to anyone looking for a professional and modern office space with beautiful views. Thank you!</review>

<text>Absolutely horrible service.NEVER EVER USE THIS SERVICE. I am 100% honest and a very easy going person. These people scammed me out of a ton of money. I was told that the offices would be one price and when I arrived there they attempted to charge me hundreds of dollars more per hour. I am a 100% honest person and if you are reading this review you can contact me personally and I can show you what these offices did. These people treated me so badly I plan on going on as many review sites as possible to expose them for what they really are. I was talked down to and treated like an animal as soon as I got to the front desk. I was told I would be charged hundreds per hour if I continued to sit in the lounge area. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE do not use this service. You will be treated inhumanely and also scammed. I was told one price and one thing over the phone then they tricked me into being able to run my credit card so when I showed up at the facility they tried to charge me hundreds more. There is plenty of other offices in Los Angeles where you will #1 not get treated like an animal and #2 will not be scammed. DO NOT USE THIS SERVICE. They charged me for providing me no service whatsoever, threatened me, and tricked me into running my credit card. STAY AWAY.I would not bother writing this review as well as several others I plan on writing if I was not treated like total garbage!</text>< Pics>

I honestly tried to nitpick and look for reasons to give some feedback so I can make the overall experience over here better, but I can't couldn't think of anything. It's been 2 month since I signed the lease with Rebecca, and I haven't had a single issue since. I remember moving my things in late at night the next day, and I somehow managed to screwed up my login info that the she for my personal Cisco Wi-Fi portal. I emailed the front desk staff close to midnight that day, and got an email from Marcella at 9am in the morning with a link and detailed step by step explanation on how to fix it. Marcella, Alondra, and Jajaura (the Titan front desk crew) are the best I've seen. I've worked in the service industry for over five years and managed a front desk staff, but they're awesome at what they do. Always great you with a smile as soon as you come up the elevator, even if they're swamped and ask how you're doing. Couldn't be happier with this decision, and I highly recommend checking it out if you're starting up a business or need a location that makes you look good infant of clients. Lastly, schedule the tour with Rebecca. She didn't rush the tour at all and did an awesome job at explaining everything so you know exactly what payments to expect and when. Very excited to start my first tax practice from here and offering an awesome first impression to all our future clients!<//text>

<Text>I was able to efficiently use Davinci's booking service online while in transit at Seattle airport and secured a space for me to present future clients my company’s marketing plan for their product. I acquired a room that had a lovely view of the city with a beverage service that provided a very comfortable and professional atmosphere for our meeting. I'll undoubtedly continue to use Davinci rooms to help ease my business travels.</Text><user_id>116945374703007002498< /user_id><Time>1531747298891<//Time><Name>Michael Stearnley<//Name></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
Decent office, a lot of noise, our meeting was interrupted by the staff to show the room to another potential client.

Edit: after a year of when I reviewed this office location they reached out to apologize and this in my book earned them an extra star!< /Review>

Great coffee. Prices are good,  average $5 a cup. One size. Small cups but full of favor. Decor is very cool and interesting. They close early so make not of that. I will come back<//text>

Great vibe to this place. Nice staff, very clean and the music was really good. The menu offers a lot of choices and features Nathan's dinner size hot dogs. I had the Reefs which came with house made chili, slaw and Tabasco onion strings. Really liked it and the bun was great but didn't hold together well because of the chili and slaw. Forks and knives at the table. One suggestion. Offer a low sodium dog. Everything a bit salty. Otherwise, 5 stars.< /Text>

< review>
Brought here by an in-law who doesn't know that I don't like hot dogs. I can't fault the restaurant for that. I looked for alternatives and found tater tots. Trying to eat healthy so kept looking and was happy I found Brussel sprouts. Hubby ordered while I saved a table so I didn't ask questions... like, "how long do you keep those beautiful little veggies deep in the fryer to remove any resemblance of a Brussel sprout?" :-(

I ended up picking them apart to find small pieces in the center of some that were not crisp beyond recognition.  I'd ordered chili also for some form of protein and found little chunks of hot dogs in it. Yuck!

Now, the rest of the family chowed down loved the food and had a great time but, if you want to eat even semi-healthy, I Do Not recommend this place.</review>

A beautiful joint, with pretty good food, and bands that show up sometimes. It's my favorite restaurant for central Cali. This isn't a bit hahah<//Text>

There is a terrace with tables and heaters and the vibe with the boards is cool. The service is very friendly, fast and kind and the food is delicious with many options and a fair price. Good choice of beers, ice cream and meat/potatos, mainly hot dogs and side dishes, for a fair price. We had one hot dog, tots as side and a mimosa with pomegrante ice cream and we were so delighted. Highly recommended!</Text><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None</Response><Gmap_id>0x808de1bf9862b637:0x3742e6971491bc46< /Gmap_id></record>

I always stay in pacific groove,  and usually head towards the warm for food, but I couldn't resist trying this place because of the stars by other members, at first I wasn't sure because there was no one there at the time.  Upon entering you soon notice that this place has embraced a culture of California and made it truly one of a kind.  The food was probably the most simple ingredients yet so creative make your taste buds happy. Was cold out because of Covid-19 but they had heaters, they even have coffee, no ice cream this day, but they got it.   If I was a millionaire I totally would try to buy a franchise of this place.    Upon 5 min into our eat, the place got packed.  They got my order wrong offered to credit the extra food. But I was like nope ill be happy to buy another.   My favorite was the peeks, but destroying the other food next time.  This place needs to spread across California.< /Text>

<name>Toby Shawar</name><time>1623615592803<//time><Rating>2</Rating><Text>When I walked in, I was greeted by a friendly waitress. She seemed nice and on her A-game. I ordered the Asilomar, which was a bacon wrapped chili dog with cheese sauce and jalapeños, and the Ollie, tater tots with a sprinkle of green onion (why the green onion? Who knows). Once I received my order, it looked kinda good, but it really wasn’t. I was clueless on how I should approach eating it. The bun was very soggy. I picked up the dog and it all fell apart and plopped back into the boat. It was very sad. I took a bite anyway because I was hungry and what do you know, no flavor... The dog it’s self was kinda greasy, I got a small hint of beef but that was it. I saw the bacon but the flavor was nonexistent. The chili was probably the worst part. No flavor, bland, you name it! I took a closer look and saw that they used canned tomatoes...That’s a no-go. Canned? In a restaurant? You gotta be kidding me. The cheese sauce was subpar, no real flavor. It was all just sad.

The tater tots were pretty subpar too. I buy the Great Value ones at Walmart and those taste better than these!! $8 for this? What? I can get a bag for like $5 and it’ll last a good week tops! Why the green onion? It’s not healthy food so why bother adding it? The green onion did not taste fresh either. It tasted as if it was just sitting there for a few hours, precut, waiting to be sprinkled on some subpar tots. Disgusting.

Overall, the food was not to my liking nor were the prices. $12 for a subpar hot dog? No thank you. $8 for some subpar tater tots with a sprinkle of stale green onion? Nope. If you like subpar food, this place is for you! I will say the service was nice, but that’s all this place will get. The addition of live music was nice too so that’s why I’m rating this place 2 stars. If you want a good place with good food and atmosphere, you need to work more on the most important aspect: the food!<//Text><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

Lucy was very nice and bubbly and more than willing to make her customers happy. The menu might sound a bit dull being hotdogs and tater tots but with her imagination on how to bring new flavors to old standards was a highlight to PG experience. I highly recommend this amazing local joint to anyone looking for a new and delicious take on what might be considered standard fair. Oh and the ice cream is heavenly as well. We will back Lucy you can count on that!<//text><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

We live nearby and eat here regularly.
Some days we are here early for coffee and breakfast burritos, meeting friends at a safe distance on the great outdoor patio.  Other days we come at lunch and enjoy crisp corn dogs, or the award winning clam chowder special, or the amazing selection of topped dogs and totals.  Better yet we come in the afternoon for awesome Marianne’s ice cream shakes or sundaes or cones or floats...  So glad to have this place in our neighborhood!<//review>

This place is epic! My wife and I come to PG a couple times per year because of how much we love it here and this place just took it up another notch. Best hot dogs on the planet, fantastic chowder that comes with the best cheese bread I've ever had, and the fact that they have coffee available in the morning is icing on the cake. It also has a rad skate/surf/punk vibe. A must try.<//Text>

This place is excellent.

I stayed in Pacific Grove over a 3 day weekend. I visited Lucy's 4 times.

Their ice cream and shakes are amazing. The coffee is quite good as well.

However, it was the friendly staff that I appreciated the most. Morning or night everyone was courteous and gave off the vibe of people who actually enjoy their place of work. No McDrones here!

During one of my visits an elderly lady had a bad fall on the sidewalk outside that led to paramedics and police being called. She was checked over and was okay other than a nasty bump on the head.
I bring this up due to the response of the staff at Lucy's.
Once the hubbub died down and paramedics left the staff sat the woman down at a table. They took care of her order without payment and took some time to chat with her.

It made me very happy to see the care the staff took with this lady who had an unfortunate accident. Their conversation was very organic and sweet.

I'll definitely be returning to Pacific Grove in the future and Lucy's will be a required stop every time.< /review>

<text>Stopped in for ice cream, it looked like they also sell hot dogs & sausages.
The ice cream I had was yummy. I got 1 scoop of the 1020 which I think was chocolate and coffee ice cream with crushed oreos, and 1 scoop of the Butter Brickle. The young woman who served us didn't know what was in the various ice creams and didn't seem to care, but she did let us try flavors so that was nice.
My partner got a pistachio milkshake which she said was tasty but had too much milk.< /text></record></dataset><record>

Great vibe. Beer and apps were good. But, the franks were not good and buns were not steamed. Expected more from a joint that specialized in just hot dogs. I would have rather had a Costco hot dog instead.</Review>

Came here for outdoor seating amid COVID-19. Great atmosphere to the place, especially for families. Good location & decorations with vintage surfboards, skateboards, and 70's music playing. Hot dogs were good, but I am rating 3 stars because I wish they had more variety to the menu. Pizza, burgers, chicken strips, etc. would give people who don't like hot dogs a chance to enjoy a meal at this place! Menu also is a little overpriced: $10 or more for a hot dog and $5 for a coffee.<//review>

Great atmosphere and I love the vibe it has. I had the Peaks Dog, the roasted brussel sprouts, and a mermaid mimosa. I also tried a scoop of the chiquita ice cream. It was sooooo good. I didn't like the bun, it did a poor job at holding everything in. I sadly lost my hot dog due to that. However, the rest of the toppings were so good, I only missed the dog a little.< /Text>

<rating>3< /rating><Text>Good service but if you're not ready to eat a $13 hotdog that requires a fork and knife on a thin piece of paper that you cut straight through creating an unnecessary mess... it's best to try somewhere else.

Spent $35 ona can of coke, a hotdog, and a cup of chowder.

As for the dog itself I'd like to quote Simba by saying, "Slimy yet satisfying".</Text>< Pictures>

<text>Not too sure about the food as I did not eat here but I give it a 3+ because the atmosphere and seating was awesome and the place was packed with people on the inside and out. Had a cool visual for anyone who loves to admire skateboards and surfboards. They even had a cornhole game for guest to play for free. I am stopping to eat here next time if not for their hotdogs most gaurenteed their love of great famous Mariannis  ice cream xox</text>< Response>

Eric was very helpful and I was able to get my first truck for a good price. I got a 2009 Ford Ranger for a great price. Truck runs great and is in awesome condition! I drove it off the lot. Very easy process and friendly service. I'd highly recommend!< /Review>

I went to Valley Auto Repo today to get a car. The service was executed perfectly. Eric was a big help and after trying to get a loan Fernando went above and beyond to get me the loan. The service was terrific and they would constantly make sure I was comfortable while the process was being made. Truly a great experience. Everything about this place was just perfect. Thank you Eric and Fernando for the great experience.< /Text>

For 3 months I'm trying to get them to give the correct one even if it's used from a different car or a new one but when I walked in this morning Fernando is telling me that the dealer didn't sell it with one and if I want one I should purchase it myself and if I don't like it I can , and I quote "..go F@&$ myself and if i will be late in a payment even one day Fernando will repo my car.." . I left their place so ashamed to have dealt with them, no wonder they are called Valley Auto Repo.So if you want to deal with This kind of person go to them.</text>< Pics>

Horrible horrible HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. Appointment only? Agree on numbers BEFORE test drive? Not the way it works. You guys aren’t a major retailer relax. obviously they don’t like making money.< /text>

Thank you Fernando for helping me get my auto loan. I was having trouble with other dealers because of my credit and they were offering me insanely high interest rates until I came to Valley Auto Repo. They were able to give me the greatest deal compared to all the other used dealers in the valley area. If anyone is looking for a reliable used car I recommend this establishment. I got a Lexus IS 250 F sport and it was extremely clean. It came with all the packages I needed and the drive is very smooth. Thank you guys once again!< /review>

Valleyautorepo Is by far the place to go! Whether it’s for your dream car, every day car, Or work car. When I first seen the car that I was interested in I picked up the phone and right away someone answered he was very nice very helpful and accommodated me and the best way ever.His name was Raffi very helpful and very patient and has good energy. Scheduled an appointment with him but right to the point got everything done so quick with the help of Erick his coworker which is the other sales rep here at the dealership they both did the job exactly how it’s supposed to be done because at the end of the day I got the car I wanted I drove off the lot. In less than 24 hours from when I contacted The dealership I was on
way out satisfied with the The car I was looking for. I will definitely be recommending more people to this car lot because of how my experience was the best ever and made my day, we know that they were doing something right. Stop by today ask for either Raffi or Erick toget You’re a new car they’re
open 7days a week.< /Text>

THANKYOU FOR SELLING ME A CAR WITH NO ISSUES.
Also I just want to thank Auto Valley Repo for not judging based on my credit history. I appreciate the great lengths they went to helping with my loan and even my insurance. To top it all off the car I bought from them hasn't had a single issue. The customer service was also great I couldn't be more satisfied with my experience Thankyou again Valley Auto Repo!< /Text>

If I could give a negative star I would, I was a potential buyer for the Chevy Express that they still have listed. I got approved for financing for the listed amount at the time 11,226. After they found out that I was using my own bank they claimed to have made a mistake on the listing price and hurried up and changed it to 13,999. I went round and round with them about their mistake shouldn't be at my expense. They said "Oh we can change the price at any time". It's like really so when I fly out to buy you could charge me 16,000? This company can not be trusted, anytime they said they would call me back they never did once.<//review>

If i could give it no stars i would!!! Spoke to Fernando for about 2 days, i was pre-approved w/ WestLake financial for a $10,000 vehicle... he went off to explain that was inacurate that they just claim that but at the end of the day there’s no approval... but they were LIES! i called westlake & they said valley auto repo had denied me BUT another deal approved me for a $12,000 vehicle... I understand times are tough right now due to COVID but it is NOT okay that he rejects my approval just because he won’t really get comission out of it. I’m sorry but that’s how sales is some days you lose some you win so you shouldn’t deny someone the loan JUST BECAUSE IT ISN’T THE OUTCOME YOU EXPECT!!! Westlake also stated to not having done buisness w/ Valley Auto for the past 2 months because they tend to want to keep offers for themselves SO SICK!!</text>

I got referred to Valley Auto Repo from a friend. I was looking for a used car and I saw the one he got and it was very clean. I thought to check out the different types of cars the my had so I went to their lot in North Hills. It was only a 10 minute drive from my house in Northridge.

They had all different types of models that I was looking for such as Acura, BMW, Honda, and Chevy. They also had a wide range of other makes and models to look at. Great customer service and a thanks to Erick for helping me out!< /text>

I was able to find an amazing car at Valley Auto Repo in North Hills. I went to all the different dealers on Van Nuys to find a used car from the dealerships but I wasn’t satisfied. I was looking for a very well maintained used Kia Optima that fit my price budget. They had an amazing  Kia that was 2014 with roughly 40,000 miles on it, the car was very clean and everything was well kept. Definitely recommend if you’re looking for a new used car.<//Text>

< Review>
These guys are the best. I came here to take a look at a Jaguar that caught my attention and they weren't your average "Buy", "Buy", "Buy" people. I asked them how much the car was and then when I found that it was at a great price, so I asked them if I could see inside the car and they pretty much gave me the keys and left me alone to check it out. That was a big plus for me, which is what I like because it gives you time to check out the interior and you know, get a feel for it, see if you would be comfortable driving it, etc. It wasn't after the lady came by and asked if I wanted a test drive (which I did) and I basically ended up taking the car home that day. They were also very professional with the paperwork and credit stuff. I believe they're a family business, which is why they were so nice but I'm not sure. Point is, If you want a great car with a great deal, then go to them they will help you out. Just talk to them. To be honest, I don't think I've ever been to a car dealership and felt like if it was my friends who were selling me the car, not some random salesperson.  The last one I went to before them was Keyes in Van Nuys and the guy I dealt with was very pushy and arrogant. So this was a great find.

Thanks guys!<//Review>

<time>1547055012748</time><Text>DO NOT buy a car here! They pretty much hide everything about a car if it has problems. I bought a 2007 Cadillac Escalade with  160K miles, even though it looked to be in fair condition I knew it would not be perfect I asked them if it is in good condition and they said yes. I asked if it has any problems at all, and they said no. BUT....when I test drove it and saw that some of the sensor warnings were on like the air ride suspension, they said "it was just serviced so the on board computer has not registered the repairs yet. So come to find out the suspension is not working at all which could be a $5000 or more repair. Not only that but after a couple days my battery kept going dead and I had to charge it everyday, when I took the battery out to get it tested it was a piece of $&!% brand that obviously was put in there to save money, and I'm assuming it was used already. The worst part was the registration, I was told would probably be around $350 which I paid upfront, yet the registration due after I made the purchase was actually $1200, of which I had paid the $350 at purchase, then they told me I had to pay half of the total which was $600. Actually I found out that they had me pay some of the back owed fees!. So I sent them the remaining balance, and asked them to send me the new registration and tags because I live 2 hours away, so the salesman says "well I will mail them but 90% of the time they never get there". As soon as he said that I knew I was never going to get them, and I was right. I guess one of their lemons received my tags!< /Text>< UserId.>

This is a place where they will be able to sell a car with bad or no credit, I have been to so many places, they were the most hospitable and caring, I love them, they do understand everybody's unique situation and they will find a solution for you, have no doubt, I highly recommend Valley Auto Repo to everyone.</text>

<rating>4< /rating><review>Beautiful store with beautiful items for very good prices. The problem is the size options. They just don’t have the average sizes which is not cool at all. You look and look and till you do find something, you hear we don’t have it I. Stock. The problem of 90% of the stores here.</review><Pics>None<//Pics><time>1620358334897</time>< userid>

Absolutely delicious, I got the shrimp lotus iron pot, and the yi bin spicy noodles and it was amazingly perfect. The lotus root was wonderfully crunchy to match with the shrimp in the pot. My only suggestion is blow out the flame as it just keeps everything too hot to eat, but it looks pretty.
And the spicy noodles had prickly ash / Szechuan peppercorns and were also a spicy and a most satisfying way. Simply good food.<//review>

<Text>Sadly, this place is not a place we will not returning to. The sour vegetable and meat noodles are bland, it’s not sour, it’s not sweet, it’s not salty, it’s just blah. No taste to it. I feel like the vegetable was cut from those pre-packaged veggie bag and the sliced meat and dump in vegetable soup. Chow fun is not fun to eat, it salty and has no other taste. The wonton has one small piece of shrimp in it (from a shrimp chop in 4 pieces) and poorly wrapped wonton sheet. Again the soup has no taste to it. Not sure where all the 5 stars reviews are coming from but we did not enjoy the food as we were so excited to try this place.< /Text>< Pics>

<Text>Recently opened neighborhood Sichuan Restaurant. Great food at very good price, given Sichuan cuisines tend to be pricier.

The best part here is how "nice" this place is for a Chinese restaurant. The store is very clean and waiters are very friendly, often stopping by to ask how our food is. Will come back again!< /Text><response>None< /response><Name>Nop Jiarathanakul< /Name></record>

Delicious. Entrees are definitely big enough to share. Our table of five ordered 5 entrees and an appetizer. We probably would have been fine with three. Table favorite was the spicy prawn clay pot. Pictured is spicy beef clay pot.< /Text>

BEST Szechwan food in the Sunset or Richmond. Get the cold noodle or yi bin noodle, and the cold spicy beef (incredible).</Text>

The best Szechuan place in San Francisco period.  I go here with 1st Gen Asian people that say the same, if that helps any.  The frog is spectacular, the Dan Dan Mein is off the chain, and the Cumin with Lamb is amazing.  The Also, the House Cold Noodle is the one of the best things on the menu - it will make your face go numb.  Did I mention the staff is extremely friendly and personable. Incredible place.<//Text>

Everything was delicious. We ordered Kong pow chicken, Beef fried rice, fried spring rolls with sweet-and-sour sauce, and mapow tofu. Spicy, but everything was so good. Friendly staff!</text>

Went with a high expectation after reading good reviews for vegetarian food, but felt the taste was only average. Tried the vegetable potstickers, Dan Dan noodles, Mapo Tofu. The tofu was extremely soft but didn't exactly feel as spicy as it was marked super spicy on the menu (note: my spice appetite is pretty good). Potstickers were good but the very popular noodles actually felt undercooked and very chewy - but the host said that's how they're prepared so I guess it didn't fit my palette but can work for others. Service was pretty friendly and ambience was casual.</review>

My first time ordering here. I came to them because they were open on Christmas!!! I ordered extensively across the menu: hot and sour soup, iron pot fish, pea vine, Mongolian beef, Dan Dan noodles, among others. The food was spectacularly good, and it was waiting for me at the moment I walked through the door to pick it up. I cannot recommend this restaurant highly enough, and it's our new "go to" for takeout or eat-in Chinese food in San Francisco.< /Text>

<Text>Food here is delicious!  Veggies are always fresh, consistently high quality, and a good variety of spicy dishes but also dishes that are not spicy.  I eat here regularly.  Beef and broccoli, salt and pepper squid, and spicy fried cabbage are a few of my favorite dishes.  Definitely recommend this place.< /Text><date>1571408211304<//date>< UserId.>

They have a little section of Vegetable and Tofu, nearly all of which was veg (but be careful and ask to be sure).

Our helpful server confirmed that the Mapo Tofu and the Eggplant in Sauce were both veg, so we ordered those two with rice. Both were good enough, albeit oily, and some spice in the mapo seemed odd to me. And it was not inexpensive.

I don't really have a need to return.</review>

Ordered the: Pork dumpling, zha Chengdu ZaJiang Noodles, Tofu with Minced PorkAll some of the best in their category (Sichuan) in 626. By the time we figured out payment (Apple Pay wasn't working), food was an hour past offering, and aside from being slightly cooler - still yummy. Would reorder noodles - best zhajiang I've had in the area, dumplings were slightly above average (prefer thicker/chewier skin); tofu was slightly above average.<//Review>

Waitress asked me to leave after I had diner and paid.

The food was good but the service was bad specially at the end of my diner. When I got here there were two adults and a girl in a table for six. They were waiting for the other people to join them. Well, I ordered my food, I eat them. I asked for left overs to go and I ordered a rice to go, too. After I paid, a waitress came and asked me to leave because there were people waiting to seat down. Wow!!!! I just can’t believe she said that. She never asked the other people to leave who were here way before me. I feel like asking for the tips I left, but I didn’t. So, I won’t come back here and I don’t recommend it.<//text>

Staff was extremely friendly. I was looking for spicy Szechuan food and that's what I got. Be warned, the Szechuan peppercorn is very potent along with the nice tingly numbing effect. If you're a fan of very spicy cuisine, I highly recommend this place. The presentation and cleanliness was very good. Atmosphere was small and cozy.</text>

So Good!  Peppery and Aromatic food.  Just delicious.  We happened to be in the area and were super hungry.  Wanted Chinese and when we poked our noses in, this place smelled great!  We ordered Mongolian beef, Poached fish in chili oil, and steamed dumplings.  The lunch menu food came with rice, side veges, and soup!  All very tasty.  I will definitely be going there again!!!!!<//Review>

Found this place on Christmas Eve, when the restaurant we intended to go to was closed. Wow! What a lucky find. Easily the best Chinese food I've had in years. Started off with flavorful, tender spring rolls and each subsequent dish was better than the last. The house special spicy fried rice was outstanding, as was the Mongolian beef. The staff was very friendly, and I can't wait to go back.< /text>

Fish with sauerkraut is delicious. Just be mindful it, like many of their whole fish dishes, is priced per pound. Overall good food and enjoyed the "ma la" flavor of those Szechuan peppercorns! Portions are good so be sure to take home your leftovers< /review>

Amazing food and wonderful service! The servers were very nice and patiently answered all my questions about what was in different dishes. I got the Dan Dan noodles and Iron Pot Fish Fillet. Even though I have a high spice tolerance the server recommended to get it medium spicy - a good decision in the end cos I was able to enjoy the flavors even more! I'm definitely visiting this place again!< /Text>

<Review>Good Szechuan-style Chinese food. To be honest, I'm not sure if I knew exactly what to expect from the Szechuan style but I gave it a try and was not disappointed. We ordered a lot of different items, here is the price and how I would rate each:

Dried Sauteed String Beans $12.50
Good (3 out 5)

Kung Pao Chicken $12.25
Good (3 or 4 out of 5)

Stir Fried Mongolian Beef $13.75
Good (3 out of 5)

Combination Chow Mein $11.50
Good (3 or 4 out of 5)

Szechuan Dan Dan Noodle $8.25
Good (5 out of 5)

Service, Price, and Delivery Speed:
5 out of 5: absolutely no complaints, everything was perfect!

If I need quick Chinese food again I will definitely go to this place. If I want to try to find the best Chinese food around, I will probably keep trying different places before I make a final call.< /Review><gmapID>0x8085876f88db7083:0x13532df4f8c514b3<//gmapID><rate>4</rate></record>

Extremely tasty, especially the house noodles and the iron pot fish fillet. Full of flavor and spice. Food came out extremely quickly, and the service was very attentive.<//text>

Got the cumin beef as it seemed like a favorite here, I would highly recommend getting it. The fried cabbage was unlike any vegetable I’ve had - really great.

Service was incredibly nice. Had a great time.</Review>

This is one of the city’s hidden gems. It’s baffling that this place is almost never busy. Everything I try here is flame. Hard not to get the dan dan noodles every time though!< /Review>

<text>One of the best places in the city to get poached fish in szechuan chili oil. Great wontons, dumplings, and cumin lamb too,and you'll be stuffed on a bill you'd normally expect for one person in this city. Great boba milk tea next door!<//text>< Pics>

Both places we were planning to go to had lines out the door, so we wandered down the street and this was the first place that caught my eye. What a great choice! Delicious, very authentic Szechuan food. Waitstaff was very friendly, made some good suggestions, and was accommodating of our request to substitute vegetable dumplings instead of pork dumplings in one of the appetizers. Three appetizers and one large entrée was about the right amount of food for three people. The fried fish covered in red chilies and sichuan peppercorns was everything I hoped for.<//text>

Some of the tastiest, spiciest sichuan food I've had lately. Super friendly service, awesome lunch specials. Highly recommended!

<Text>We went to eat at this restaurant and we bought 4 dishes. First, let's wait for about 35 minutes to give us the first dish. The speed of serving is very slow. Ask the waiter, she said, wait a minute, and she spoke slobber, disgusting, very bad attitude, we are going Eat instead of eating angry. And the taste of the food is very poor, this is the worst I have ever eaten, I have never encountered such a bad restaurant.<//Text><Rate>1< /Rate>< Date>

I tried the dan dan noodles and were amazing. Spice was just perfect for me. I totally recommend. You can get it either with pork or veggie style. And their veggie potstickers were really good. Great flavor and they were a little toasty so it was perfect. If I'm ever again visiting the area I will definitely stop by again. And the service was great as well.</review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

An underrated place for relatively authentic Szechuan food! The owners are extremely friendly and welcoming. The restaurant itself is cozy and comfortable.

Make sure to try the cumin beef and iron pot offerings when you're here you won't regret it. Lots of great spicy food and a pretty long menu. It can be a bit pricey but not bad for the city. My wife and I have made this place our regular go-to for spicy Chinese food!

P.S. - it's not called tofu village anymore. It's called Szechuan Cuisine with a big red sign.</Text>

I love how I can get a set meal of kalbi and tofu soup whenever I can't decide. Also this place is so much closer than Tofu House and slightly cheaper. The couple that runs this place is super friendly and nice! A lot of small dishes and yummy fish!<//review>

<review>NPR said, sichuan or Szechuan food is the next big cuisine to take over the planet. I believed them and decided to hunt for the best Sichuan restaurant. Exhibit A - voila - Szechuan cuisine.

What makes szechuan cuisine very interesting is a unique blend of spices. Not hot per se, but have this numbing sensation, that numbs your tongue, mouth, but in a pleasant way.

You can ask for the level of spice to be turned down - we didn't - and we survived to tell the tale.

The menu is overwhelming, over 100 items, some with photos, and strange sounding concoctions. But you can ask the server for recommendations (they are super friendly). I asked for veggie and seafood, and the wife wanted the best dim sums (they recommended pork in chili oil). We had tofu, shrimp and greens-based apps and entrees. You cannot go wrong - none of the 5 items we tried was a doozy.

Great flavors, no MSG, great service (yes, in an Asian restaurant), and food prepared with love - this is your destination du delicious jour.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None<//Response><Gmap_id>0x8085876f88db7083:0x13532df4f8c514b3</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Great food and great service. The owner is very friendly. Our 2 year old child is always welcome and treated very nicely. Spicy pork bulgogi is amazing.< /Text>

<rate>1<//rate><review>You can delete my review by paying money to YELP,

But you can not delete here!

firstly, we went there several times, the food they recommended us were bad at all.

Those which we ordered by ourselves were ok.

I think they were not good because we forgot our belongings but they said did not know at all.

They claimed that they helped me to looking for it but in fact? I don't know.

Specially, after I posted my review on YELP,

The owner sent me a mesage which is very impolite and said that it was my fault and no one should have looked it for us.

I was surprised.

A good restaurant should improve their service when facing the negative review,
but they do not,

They criticize their customers and send some horrible mails and delete the negative reviews by money.

Everyone has the power to tell us their experience in your place,

So give up your foolish behavior and think about how to improve your bad service!

There is few people in your place in spite of the noon,

Why?

You know the answer.

No problem , if you can , delete this by paying money to google, Lol</review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

<text>So sad the old Tofu Village had to go away and was replaced by this awful establishment.

Food was not great. I got the mapo tofu lunch special and the wontons in chili oil. Pretty standard Sichuan dishes to use as a measuring stick. The lunch special comes with soup and some vegetables. Those were fine. The mapo tofu was all in all pretty awful. It was spicy, sure, but that's all it was. The tofu itself was too firm and too sour. The sauce was not salty enough, so you only taste the bitterness of the spice. The wontons were okay, but nothing to write home about.

If it were just bad food, I wouldn't have given it one star, because there could be other dishes that were better. But what made it a 1-star for me is the fact that I got sick later that day. I usually don't get sick from food unless it's really bad so something was wrong with the food since I didn't eat anything after that for the rest of the day.</text><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None< /Response>< gmap_id>

(Translated by Google) First of all, this restaurant tastes good. I like boiled fish very much. However, I think the most important thing is to go to eat! The black restaurant in Clement Street that I went to before, in addition to the taste is not good, the biggest problem is that the service is very poor, none of the employees have a smile. This store is different, the service is good, and the smile is nice. So I think it's worth recommending

(Original)
首先，这家的味道不错，水煮鱼我很喜欢。但是，我觉得去吃饭，最重要的还是服务！之前去的Clement街那家黑色店面的湘菜馆，除了味道不好吃以外，最大问题是服务很差，老板员工没有一个有笑容的。这家店不一样，服务很好，笑容很Nice。所以，我觉得值得推荐</Text>

<Review>I visited this facility because it was recommended to me as the nearest property having 10' X 10' units available, which is what I was seeking. I met Mia at the reception. She was extremely courteous and thorough with the entire process. It took me a while to understand the details as this was my first time renting public storage but, Mia was very patient and like a pro guided me through all the steps. She even helped me download and activate the app on my phone that I could then use to access this facility. My experience here has been great!

I would highly recommend this facility to anyone reading this review and looking to rent storage units.</Review><date>1620760445960< /date>< userid>

<Rating>1< /Rating><review>CUSTOMER SERVICE IS DEAD.
Politeness is not customer service, it is common curtesy. Doing a job is not customer service, it is mandatory for compensation based on an employee/employer agreement. Customer service is not telling a customer that a system is the cause of not being able to take action. Otherwise, we need only to rely on technology and robots without the use of humans. Actual customer service should supersede a system because a human is suppose to recognize and do what a system cannot. This location does not understand this concept, but are they blameless because many other places also lack this ability? To say I am disappointed is an understatement. Customer service is what rights wrongs but when it is not exercised, what remains in lasting form is only the wrong that was committed. The system is set up to always win, and will fail the customer if it is followed without regard to human error. Humans should have the basic compassion to manually correct human and system errors. We need more than just robots in electronic and flesh form. Public Storage, thanks for asking how I really feel, because regardless of whether you care or not... this will be stated: you need to do better. Stop using people robots for calls and email. Have genuine customer service in place at your locations. Be able to take proper action that benefits the customer too. Customers are what make a business, so do not do them wrong just because you are a larger company. There’s enough trash out here. Believe me, it is not too difficult and is better for business and average business ratings. All I kindly asked several (more than once) times is for basic customer service to be exercised for something that your company did wrong, not even me! and that was simply too complicated for your robot system or robot humans to recognize. I am bereaved at the loss of customer service as a whole in this modern time and the proof was displayed from this past week through your company, Public Storage. I would ask you to “take action”, but that would likely overload your system of robots (electronic or human) because they will not understand what that means. What a useless battle this has been. Future patrons: do not be surprised by a bit trash in units (from above or on the side) and piss smelling elevators for 2nd/3rd floor accessing patrons.< /review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPWgJuIjCHCaSeZCljgzv_BHKV_STxCyMrMelpG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNG2xYay3NkcOV7S0cpK2ChaTAmpXLLtZGcsBpW=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMgyY2vHck5u8GEw55EignLWZ3fd96LvE_MtIcY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< Resp>

This storage facility is always immaculate. We have been using it for two years now.
The staff is always professional and courteous, especially Mia.
She is friendly beyond words and goes out of her way to help whenever she can. As much as we begged her, she would not accept a tip. So, at her insistence, we’re leaving this review instead.
Thank you!<//Review>

<text>Evelyn is the best! Professional, great demeanor, fun and friendly, we decided we are going to be best friends.

Laughing so hard, such an awesome time here.

Great price, super clean. She closed the deal!

And we got an awesome space to store our stuff. Looking forward to seeing here when we come by!

Thanks so much!< /text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPVLhlPb54v70hMeK2Lj2fFZe2JGhapAChbBkWj=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNdnIULP24CtjLezczdyHO-V3Zs8hac0R-ec-y7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPMcwu8hDOoQThI8qsxb_ElS_iBWAYbj3Y_YxX8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics><response>None<//response>< gmap_id>

I politely asked if I could charge my phone in the lobby while I waited for my Uber. The employee working here said ‘that isn’t a service we offer our customers.’ I said ‘can I use this outlet right here’. She said ‘no sir, I’m very uncomfortable right now.’

I’m a paying customer at this business and I can’t charge my phone in the lobby for 5 minutes?!? Why am I being treated like a homeless person lol.<//Review>

This location itself seems safe because it is inside unlike most places I have viewed within the area. I made my reservation online then I went to the office to complete the process. I had the pleasure of experiencing Joy. She helped me with everything! From providing allllll the information, giving me the keys and walking me to my unit. The unit was very neat and well kept (so that was exciting)! Joy provided excellent help and I will always refer this particular  public storage in the future when asked. Thank you!<//review>

Very clean facility. Friendly helpful staff. Furniture movers available if you have your ID. Multi-level but large elevators. Key-code entry only. Clean bathrooms. Close to the freeway. Reasonably priced.< /Review>

Joy is an excellent customer service representative here at the 190th street location in Gardena, CA. I want to thank her for always being kind and helpful. This is a busy Public Storage as I was at another in Hawthorne. Yet Joy makes it worth it.< /review>

Jyan was at the front desk and described everything in detail. Not only was she thorough, she was pleasant to talk to and had answers to all my questions. Araceli was also present and joined with the walk through. I give this place a 5 stars!< /text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNiBEGvqNnn6DHx34W1d1cn12FNX6fLpM2XgnSo=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics>< resp>

<text>I had my unit broken into... only to find out from the police officer that 7 units had been broken into ... And that it happens frequently at this facility. I guess since it doesn’t hurt them financially they don’t make changes to protect their customers. The “ceiling” is wire mesh that the thieves just cut through and go from unit to unit. If I were you I would find a storage unit with solid roof or be prepared to have your stuff stolen at some point. I had only been with them 5 months when this happened. I can tell the front desk people are embarrassed but really can’t do much about it. Other than that I have no problem with this facility :-/< /text>< pics>

<text>Very clean, all indoors, staff very helpful. The only complaint is the garage door seems to break a lot.
Very inconvenient to haul you stuff up the ramp. And if your elderly it almost impossible.<//text>< Pictures>

After contacting another Public storage first, I spoke with Arlene over the phone and decided to rent here.
Once here I asked Joy about quite a few things,  each answer was very helpful, & her customer service rings true to her name!<//Text>

I am a returning customer.   I have always liked my Public Storage experience at this location.  But I wanted to make a special effort to commend both Arlene and Danielle for how they made my return pleasant, easy and efficient.  Great attitudes!  Great service!   I recommend this facility, and these employees, to anyone who is looking for a clean, secure, well managed storage facility.< /Text>

Earlier this morning went to this Public Storage on 190th. If I could give 10/10 I would cause Rita was awesome! She was very informative about my options w/ the units but she didn’t pressure me into getting just anything; which is key. Helping me setup my online account, to going over every detail w/ me, to showing me how everything works she was great! I couldn’t have asked for a better experience. That’s not to say the other guys/girls there weren’t great, but she took care of me from beginning to end. Anytime I need anything I’ll be looking for Rita! Thank you again I really appreciate.

<Text>This location is newly built, still being painted when I came to rent storage. I really needed a space for a good price and fast. Nieshia and Arlene came to the rescue. They were both very friendly and helpful in offering me a space that both fit my needs and my pockets. Did I mention they were fast, because I was in and out in under 18 mins.<//Text>< rating>

When I arrived one of the male workers tried to tell me the price of the unit was not going to be the same as the price I had reserved it for, despite having the reservation. Nieshia quickly stepped in to help us and ensure us that they were able to do a price adjustment. She was proactive and overall very helpful! Units are clean.</review>

Big thanks to Arlene, Nieshia and Mark.  They were super helpful in getting me the perfect unit for my move from Florida.  After a 5 day truck drive, wasn't in the mood for running around.  They got me in and out quickly and bent over backwards with all their help.  Highly recommend!< /Text>

Great customer service and a great location to store your valuables. It's right off the 405 freeway which gives easy access. The place being air conditioned is a plus with the ability to load and unload in an indoor-docking bay. Which means, you don't have to worry about the rain or what not. The workers are so helpful and pleasant. They always say hi when you come in. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone.<//Text>

<Text>Arlene and Kody were excellent and I got a great move in deal! Bring a Lantern, the units are dark. No overhead lighting since they couldn't get to it to replace a bulb or electricity.

The public storage representative Victor was very helpful and friendly.  He gave me a tour of the facility and helped me with everything I needed to know about my entrance code, the hours of operation, the ins and outs of the facility and basically everything I needed to know. Victor was very thorough with everything.  As far as the facility is concerned, it is modern, clean, and very accessible.  The hours of operation are good as well.  Thanks for everything.</text>

<text>Zero star, unit was sold before without my consent. No notification was send out that this was happen. Manager Derik is thief beware. Not a safe place no cameras around units so is easily to break in and steal or put in another unit. This location needs to be shut down and all staff should be pursuit for criminal acts. Please stay away from this place< /text>< pictures>

The customer service at this Public Storage location was extraordinary. Upon my visit, an associate by the name of Adie provided services for us and she was excellent! She made sure that we were pleased with our storage rental and provided assistance to reassure that it met our storage needs!  She truly cared about customer satisfaction! She was friendly, professional, and made us feel so comfortable! She made the environment so warm and welcoming for us and other customers. We came in so stressed from all of the moving we were doing lately and she was so helpful! Wow, this type of customer service is a breath of fresh air! I would recommend this location to anyone looking for a welcoming, stress free, and accessible storage facility. Also the covered parking lot for customer loading is splendid. I am a customer that is well pleased:)</Text>

Great storage rooms!  Don't access my storage too often, forgot how to open the locked sliding door.  Brandon from the office helped me and showed me how easy it is open the sliding door and yes, the lock does come out so you can slide the lock to an unlock position.
Everyone in the office very helpful and nice.  Great customer service!< /Review>

Excellent in every way. This nearly new facility is 10 miles from my home but well worth the extra distance. The facility has passcode security for the elevators and storage units are accessible 15 hours a day 7 days a week. Climate controlled and very clean. The staff have been extremely helpful through the move in process and when I needed to change from a medium to a large storage unit and also to arrange for cart access outside of business hours many times. There is a large lighted area inside building to load and unload which has never been full when I visited. There is a large parking lot at the front of the building so space is never a problem. A large selection of boxes and other supplies are available for purchase. I cannot think of anything to improve. Thanks.< /Text>

<Review>Excellent customer service and facility. I have been to a couple of storage facilities and by far this one has been the cleanest and most organized of all. I was impressed on how welcoming the employees were as soon as I open the door, they greet you with a smile  which is always nice to see. I can say that this facility has great customer service, Maria the employee that helped me was explicit with her answers and  let me tell you I had a lot of questions and she sure answered every single one thoroughly and with a smile. I would truly recommend this facility for it's clean and has great customer service.<//Review></record>

<review>I don’t like their process of taking our license when we want to borrow a dolly because the workers be leaving on break or something and by the time we’re finished storing, there’s no one at the office to give us our license back so we have to wait and that’s not right. What if we’re in a rush and have somewhere to go? They need to switch off workers or something during breaks so there will always be someone in the office. Also, the workers should not close storage until they received all of their dollies back because they’re holding everyone’s licenses. There have been cases where all the workers just leave without reaching out to the people borrowing the dollies then all the doors be locked and people can’t get their licenses back until the next day. They need a better system. This one is not it! Don’t take people’s licenses or get better workers!< /review><Gmap_id>0x80c2b559e99cb4d1:0x1e6dbc460936d457< /Gmap_id>< time>

<text>Raul. This one is for you and Valerie.

Facility is outstanding, enclosed loading/unloading area with easy access to the elevators. Units themselves are in a controlled environment and well lit and well ventilated. Units are accessible from 6am to 9pm. My other unit with a competitor costs me more, 7-7 access and isn't as nice. The staff that I dealt with (Raul and Valerie) were very professional and very friendly.

Pros:
-lovely staff and not just to look at
-enclosed loading/unloading area.
-great units
-competitive price

Cons:
-proprietary locks required
-you don't get to set your own access code to the elevators and the process is a bit awkward.
-They won't let me move into my unit.... I even said please.< /text><Rate>4<//Rate><userid>106555981659221334188</userid><gmap_id>0x80c2b559e99cb4d1:0x1e6dbc460936d457< /gmap_id>< Date>

Nieshia is always so happy to see me always greeting me with smiles and very helpful.

She helps me when I forget my code...politely reminds me my bill is due.

I enjoy coming into storage bc we always have a good laugh.

Public Storage needs more Nieshia across the country bc of her good attitude and happy personality.

Thank you for having fabulous employees like Nieshia!

GREAT customer service, always greeted with a smile, as the staff is very helpful! The facility is very clean, and well-maintained. I actually have a public storage two blocks from my house, but because this location has climate control, conveniently supplied carts for item transportation, and most importantly as I mentioned before, EXCELLENT customer service, I do not mind driving the extra mile. I would highly recommend this location to anyone and everyone looking for a place that is safe and secure for their belongings.<//review>

<Text>Excellent customer service and facility. I have been to a couple of storage facilities and by far this one has been the cleanest and most organized of all. I was impressed on how welcoming the employees were as soon as I open the door, they greet you with a smile and cordiality which is always nice to see. I can say that this facility has great customer service, Bristy the employee that helped me was super nice with her answers . I had a lot of questions and she sure answered every single one thoroughly and with a smile. I would truly recommend this facility for it's clean and has great customer service.<//Text></record>

I had to move quickly and wanted a place that was close to my new living location in Hermosa Beach. This location was perfect! It was easy to get to bc it’s off a main road and close to the 405, it was so clean and the ladies in the office Arlene & Nieshia were so sweet and a pleasure to meet when I was getting my unit set up! I would def rent here again. Thanks!<//Review>

They are always friendly & helpful! We moved to the area about 2 years ago & chose this location because it was indoors, not too far from home, has convenient hours, and it is clean. It took us a while to decide where to store our household goods since we moved into a smaller house from out-of-state.  We are very happy that we chose this location!  All of the storage facilities closer to our house were not climate controlled, cost more & usually drive-up type.  (We had a drive up storage in Spokane & although it can be easier, it was humid & musky even though it was a brand new facility. Plus we had so many bugs at that one!) I will definitely chose indoor facilities from now on, just like this one!!!

Adie has been there to help us out since we started.  They contacted us at the first sign of something possibly leaking by our unit, luckily nothing was damaged or leaking inside, but it is good to know they actually take a look at things!  It is easy to drive up close to get things in & out.  They offer carts free of charge to use which is very helpful, I use them almost every time I go there. Every associate has always been helpful & courteous.

It is located right off of the 405, close to shopping & not far from my husband's job.  It is never too crowded to find close parking.  I would recommend this location!< /text>

Adie needs a raise because she has been very informative in my decision to choosing a space and I really appreciate it.  She is also patiently gracious in answering my questions. I would definitely recommend my friends and relatives to this place if they were to chose a storage place.< /Text>

<Text>Well first and for most i loved the old workers that use to be here they had extremely good customer service. (  Adie )

Now in 2019 your staff aren't to friendly very lazy and they act like the Don't want to work. The orher weekend i came with my fiance and he had to use the restroom they didnt want to open it for him and then as soon as i arrived they opened the restroom for me. Now today once again you worker Niesha is very rude and we dound a crack pipe on the ground that they acted like they didnt want to pick up. I have a picture of it and im sending it to the corporate office</Text>< pictures>

<rate>1< /rate><Text>I am very disappointed in my experience here. When I got my storage, I was not told that in 6 months, the price would increase 20%, which is almost a $60 increase for my storage unit. I've rented many storages in the past, including a different Public Storage, and I've never experienced this. Some storages such as U-Haul actually decreased the rate after a certain period as an incentive to keep customers who pay on time. When I called the corporate office to express my concerns, the representative told me that the contract I signed says, "subject to change" and therefore they are able to make an "executive decision" to raise rates 20%. This forces many customers to downsize (where the price will again increase in 6 months) or pay the higher rate, as it is a huge hassle to rent a truck and movers to move to a new storage. I feel that this practice is very unethical. I would not recommend this storage - there are many nice storages in the Gardena/ Redondo Beach area without this policy. It may also be helpful to look at the reviews of this storage on Yelp.< /Text>< pictures>

the storage place is close the price was right the building very clean and secure and the staff was great. my dealings were with a very bright and friendly employee named Adie. Her help and kindness was very much appreciated. in a world where you only see the top of peoples heads while they text it was nice to see a smile and eyes. thank you ..Ray King</text>

<Review>Adie and Brenda provided great customer service. Adie is hilarious. Sandra was very helpful the first time I came. Brenda you are the bomb. Overall, they made my experience extremely pleasant and doubt it would've been the same without them. Seriously, they are thee best. I highly highly recommend.<//Review><Resp>None</Resp>< UserId.>

<Text>Called in and made a last minute request to see some available storage units and spoke with Andie. She was great and friendly over the phone. When I showed up to meet with Andie she was just fantastic totally super friendly and very helpful answered all my questions with ease and was just perfect in everyway possible I swear she is small but so adorable and so beyond sweet I swear I would totally put her in my pocket and take her home with me if i could but obviously that would be impossible but again if you need help she would be the go to person for great info, insight and help. Was totally worth checking out and yes i did sign up for a storage unit just for the simple fact of Andie being so lovable and great! Thanks Andie so much for everything you are perfect in everyway imaginable and a dream to be an employee for any company...Public Storage should feel privileged to have someone like you working for them. ;)<//Text>< Pictures>

Nice place, nice staff.. the only thing I didn't like was that I was specifically told I didn't need to pay my rent until the 7th, due to a late move in. I specifically said AT THE TIME OF MOVE IN I was only renting for one month. So I go to close my account and I am told I need to pay second month because "their policy changed" and they didn't bother to let any of the customers know about this change(no email or phone call). So I had to pay an extra month just to close out my storage. Spoke with the manager, he said he would call back but never can seem to get ahold of him since the first talk I had with him over the phone.< /Review>

Clean Friendly environment and Awesome service!
I wasn't sure what size I should get for the storage.
Adie helped me out to get the perfect size unit.
I've been using this facility ever since.
Adie and the staff will always greet you with a big smile,
Even when you rush in the office 2min. before closing~!< /Review>

Adie

I have experienced some wonderful assistance from Adie on numerous occasions. She is one of the finest, most informed people I have ever dealt with. She seems to know the business here at Public Storage inside and out.  She must be an excellent asset to your company.  I wanted to take a moment to write a sterling review for her because she is worth every bit of it.<//text>

<Review>Adie, Bristy, & Maria provided excellent customer service. The facility is clean, well maintained, and secure. I shopped around and the customer service is what sold me. These ladies were knowledgeable and made me feel like my needs were what mattered. By far the best storage experience I've had (and I have rented a lot of storage units.)</Review>< Pictures>

Their location is ideal for our purpose.  The Facility is nice and clean.  All the staff members there are helpful and courteous.
The parking in the building helps when weather does not cooperate.</Review>

< Review>
I have been to a few Public Storage facilities in the LA Metro area, and I can tell you that it was worth it to make the drive from Hollywood all the way to Gardena to rent from this location.  The facility is in terrific condition.  It's clean, bright, spacious, and well maintained.  And, it offers better pricing than almost all other locations which didn't seem quite as nice.  Plus, Adie, the manager, and her staff are all super friendly and willing to work with you if you have any important needs/concerns.  They are very easy to work with.  I would recommend this location to anyone needing a storage space.</Review>

Sandra was excellent!!!. Her attitude and the way she presented herself was  continually pleasant,  attentive,  and patient. She listened very carefully to muy situation and my needs.  I ama realtor attempting to accommodate my client who is presently out of the area. My client is a existing customer of Pubic Storage.  Sandra was also helped to make a call to my office as i forgot my phone there.  In spite of nearing the closing time, she continued to exemplifying fantastic customer services. She even stayed longer to make sure I understood everything to process me. I would highly recommend Sandra and this location . Please be assured I checked several other companies and location.

Best regards,

<review>I been renting this facility for over a year and I am pleased with the excellent service I have received. Adie and counterparts have provided a professional and outstanding assistance in all my needs. From making the initial contract an easy and fast process, offering and explaining the offers and services Public Storage have; maintaining communication and following through on my needs and requirements. I can’t thank enough for all the help I have received. The cleanliness of the establishment and friendly approach of their personal (especially Adie’s), make of Public Storage a unique storage experience.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None<//resp>< GmapID>

When I arrived at the Public Storage I was greeted with a friendly smile. I also was given a friendly tour of the Public Storage. Bristy was wonderful she took the time to explain everything about Public Storage. Bristy help me pick out the best storage for me. I would recommend Public Storage to my family and friends< /Review>

Hi. My name is Tony and I brought my uncle Henry Gilbert who is well loved here. Adie has excellent service and makes people feel comfortable and at ease. She has a humorous nature and makes people laugh. She makes us wanna come here often. She is not just good but EXCELLENT. She makes you feel comfortable when you talk to her. If Public Storage wants to promote then it should be Adie because she deserves all that and more. She has a smile that makes the sun shine. Thank you for everything Adie.<//Review>

When I signed up for this storage space at the end of 2011 it was the best deal in the area.  I haven't priced units recently so I don't know if the price is still competitive.
I have a space on the 3rd floor.  Sometimes I have problems accessing the elevator but it just means having to input my password 2 or 3 times.
The bathroom on the 3rd floor does not work - it has not worked since I moved in.
There are no trash cans available, either.
I understand Public Storage might be concerned about a) the customers destroying the restroom, and b) dealing with dumping problems, but isn't that part of the business?
Adie is the manager in the office and has been there since I began renting while all the other employees have come and gone.  I hope Public Storage is paying her a decent wage because she deserves it!< /text>

From the day I became a customer in July of 2012 Adie has been helpful, friendly and knowledgeable. She always has a pleasant smile on her face and always gives me words of encouragement. I am grateful for such a sweet and kind manager. Her staff always looks happy, the facility is always clean, and customers always seems to be satisfied. I would recommend this particular location to anyone I know. Keep up the awesome work Adie and the staff of public storage in Gardena, CA.< /Text>

To Adie, Victor, Valerie and Bristy...

Thank you for all your help during 2013-2014.  You all are just great.  You are very professional and helpful.  I really like the cleanliness of the facility.  I do believe that all of you are executive material if that's an area you would like to pursue.

Take care and best wishes.

Sincerely,

L. Crume

<Review>Customer service Rep Antwone was extremely knowledgeable and very pleasant this past Saturday at this new location. My wife and I said that  Public Storage needs more customer service reps like Antwone who really went beyond the call of duty to get us setup with our new storage locker in Gardena... Thanks Antwone<//Review>< pics>

I am a fan of this public storage here in Gardena, as the best and most efficient storage service my company has utilized from prior companies.  I might add, Adie has been the face of good  customer service to my experience here. I welcome and can always count on her knowledgeable and helpful and courteous, highly pleasant smile to brighten my interactions at public storage Gardena.
Respectfully,
Randall</text>

This is an excellent storage facility! Everything is clean, well lit and easy to get in and out of. Adie, Bristy and Maria were very helpful and made a tough move much easier. I would definitely recommend using this facility if you are in need of a storage space. There's plenty of sizes to choose from and Adie was invaluable in helping me choose the right size for my needs.<//Text>

<rate>5< /rate><Review>Last year, when I was in need of a storage space, I had actually already reserved a space elsewhere when I happened to drive by the Public Storage on 190th St.  On a whim, I stopped by "just to see" what they had to offer.  Adie was the one who greeted me & enthusiastically shared information about their facility. It just so happened that there was a space available in a terrific location, too. I signed up immediately & cancelled my other reservation.  I have been completely happy w/this decision.  The staff is the BEST.  Always friendly & helpful!  The place sparkles w/their care.  Victor (also always smiling & friendly!) was polishing the elevator when I was there last week!  They all work very hard to keep the place spic & span!  The place is well-lit, temperature-controlled, & completely clean.  There are carts available (free rental) to ferry boxes & heavy items to your storage space.  There is also a nice restroom facility, & the office has packing materials for purchase.  It is the best place to store your things!  But the icing on the cake is the terrific staff who are always kind, caring, & helpful.  Heartwarming!  (P.S.  I stopped by there last week, & Adie knew me by name & my space number instantly, even though I had not seen her in a few months.  Talk about great customer service!!  She is amazing!)</Review>< pics>

I have been using storage facilities for about 8 years now and I when I opted recently to use the 1459 W 190th St, Gardena, CA as my new storage location, I didn't know that it was going to exceed my expectations I usually have when dealing with facility management.  As soon as I got there, Adie and Victor, greeted me with a smile and had a positive ability to go the extra mile to make sure a)they wanted my business and b)they wanted to keep my business.  I initially wanted a smaller unit but after Adie heard my needs she instantly recommended another better option for her available inventory that would best suit my needs.  I think I've been there about 5-6 months and I have never had a hassle getting in and out of the facility and the fact that they maintain it clean and spotless and have I think 8-10 X-Large carts available for you to use, they should have the option to give 10 stars instead of 5.</Text>

"The twelve best practices are found in companies that exemplify excellent customer service. These practices are not just something the company does, the practices are the company. Every employee in the company must understand and carry out these practices on a daily basis. Hiring people with the right attitudes and keeping them constantly trained, rewarded and recognized for demonstrating the best of these twelve practices is the way that companies achieve success. It is essential that the top person in the organization, CEO or owner also demonstrate these practices; not just among external customers, but among those internal customers, especially employees. Remembering that happy employees make happy customers is a critical bit of advice for every chief executive."

<text>I had actually lost faith in the spirit of customer service. But, when I came to the Gardena Public Storage (190th Street,) that faith was restored.  Adie, Maria, Bristy, and Victor are outstanding.   I worked in a storage place in Seattle, WA and thought I gave great customer sevice, but these folks at the Gardena Public Storage (190th Street, outshined me by far.

I give the facility a AAA rating. I  give the staff a AAA+ rating.  They are off the charts.  ;-)<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None< /resp>< GmapID>
