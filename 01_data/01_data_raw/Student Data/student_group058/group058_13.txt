Hey Brian, stellar service. Greatly appreciate you taking care of my phone. Good pricing. Welcoming customer service. No need to find another place to get my phones repaired.  I know Samsungs are complex but it was no problem for him. Like his wall says... DON'T TAKE BROKEN AS AN ANSWER.👌<//review>

<Text>This is the place to go to get your phone fixed. I called many places to get the most economical deal and this was the place. I worried I'd be compromising quality, but I couldn't afford quality and needed my phone fixed BUT was so happy to receive quality service at the best price around.
Thanks so much you guys!</Text>< Rating>

FXitRight has been a nightmare to deal with. I dropped my Verizon Ipad off with working CELL SERVICE off over 2.5 months ago for a cracked screen and the volume button not working. I was quoted $140. I had to drop it back off because it can not longer use cell data. I picked it up today to have the problem not fixed and my screen taped back on. I asked for a refund the owner told me "just use WIFI" I reminded him when I dropped the Ipad off the first it was able to use it's cellular data that is a monthly fee for me. I proceeded to tell me he can not fix the problem but he fixed the original problem and there's nothing he can do for me.< /Review>< date>

Great customer service! They said it would take 30 minutes to fix my cracked iPhone screen and it took exactly that amount of time. No complaints! Definitely recommend this place for all your phone needs! And they threw in a free phone protector and screen protector!< /Text>

I just got my phone back from FXitRight and I couldn’t be happier. I got three different things fixed and Brian did a great job on all of them. Apart from a well-done job, the cost was very reasonable and affordable. Definitely check them out!< /review>

A great place to take your phone. Why? First, they are honest. I took my phone in to get a cracked screen replaced. They quoted $75 for the repair. The technician took a look at it and told me my screen wasn't cracked, my screen protector was! So rather than $75 for the broken gorilla glass, he sold me a new screen protector for about the same price I could buy it from Amazon. My point is, he could have told me the screen needed to be replaced and I would have never known the difference. Second, they were the lowest price of all the estimates I got. Nice shop, friendly and honest staff, whats not to like?</Review>

<review>Disgusting building, horrible customer service, used my personal information to contact me and threaten me, needed police to accompany me to collect my property. Price was $60 but then changed it to $85. DO NOT GO HERE. Do not give them your phone or personal information. As far as COVID they follow absolutely 0 guidelines.

Spilt water on my macbook pro and was freaking out cause it was completely dead. Took it to fxitright and Brian assured me that it shouldn't be too big of a deal to repair.  A few days later he notified me that it was repaired and working fine.  Very thankful for his help and hospitality, I could tell that he really makes it a point to connect with his customers.  Definitely recommended fxitright for any repairs you may need!<//review>

Excellent fast service! The moment I walked in, I was greeted by the amazing Marina. She's very welcoming and keeps it real. I had the fear that my phone was irreparable, with the knowledge she has, she assured that my phone was able to be saved. And sure enough, just like new! Quick turn around! And with unbeatable deals! I will definitely return if needed and will send everyone who needs repair to Marina! 👍🏻</Text>

<time>1591139890007<//time><rating>1</rating><Text>They did a HORRIBLE job. I got my phone fixed 5/27/2020 and by 5/30/2020 my phone was broken from the inside. I tried taking it back and Brian said it was MY fault. I had to pay another 300 to fix my phone because my battery was punctured which is a hazard. I DO NOT recommend.<//Text><pictures>None</pictures><Response>{'time': 1591161650012, 'text': "Michelle, I never said your battery was punctured. I said when you first brought the phone in that you need a new battery because it was getting fat from it, letting out gas, and the battery getting fat can cause the screen to break. Something pushed on your screen or pressure from a drop. I don't know for sure, but I do know that green lines are caused by physical damage. We did a horrible job? How can you say we did an awful job when you left here with a screen working perfectly. We test all devices when they enter and when they leave, and you come back with a screen that's green with lines. It didn't leave like that, right? And you came back weeks later saying you left the phone in a locker. I'm sorry I stand on what's right. If you want me to go to my best friend and ask him to replace it, I'm sorry I can't because that's not what's right. I told you that I would not charge you for labor and told you to pay for the part and gave you a choice of an LCD or OLED, screen which is meeting you halfway, giving you 50 percent off. Then since you still didn't want to pay for the battery, I said you could let the air out with a pin needle. And then you said you would get back at me. Then I get a call from your man threatening me from the Ventura Country sheriff. I told you from the beginning that when a battery starts to go bad that it lets outgas. I also showed you that the battery was starting to get fat and told you to change your battery to prevent this from happening in which you did not want to do that. Your screen was green with lines that are from the force of something, and we don't cover physical damage. I do everything based off right and wrong, and when you came here, I explained to you that my friend owns the place I buy parts from and that he is my closest friend and I wouldn't go to my best friend and ask him to replace a part when I know that there's pressure damage and nobody in my business would return this part.\nI'm sorry I have to stand on what's right.\nBrian Flores"}</Response><gmapID>0x80e84c31eecdacfb:0x4f8201fce3bb4909< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

I walked in and Joshua serviced me.  EXCELLENT customer service with exceptional pricing.

He told me he didn't have the screen color I needed and for the inconvenience, he'd take off $10 to come back tomorrow so he could replace it with the correct color.  Since it didn't matter to me, he honored the $10 anyway!

I am one happy, satisfied customer and will definitely be back!  Please bring Joshua your service.  You will not regret it!!!</text>

<Review>I was googling cell phone repair places because I shattered the front screen of my iPhone 7+ and came across Fix it Right. I took my phone in and the associates were incredibly friendly. I was told my phone would take about an hour since there were customers ahead of me. I opted to wait and it was a pleasant wait chatting with the associate that runs the office. It was close to 2 hours before my phone was fixed and it looked good as new but I was advised the home button wasn’t responding and I needed to take my phone to Apple to have it recalibrated. In the meantime I could use the assertive assistance touch button. No problem...till I phoned the Apple store and was advised that to calibrate the home button would cost $389. Not an ‘easy as I thought it would be’ fix. I also noticed my battery was getting hot and draining rapidly so I called and was told to bring in my phone so Fix It Right could take a look at and figure out what went wrong. I took my phone back in and was assured the problems I was having would be fixed. I went to pick up my phone a few hours later and unfortunately my phone wasn’t fixed BUT I was given a full refund, no questions asked. I’m bummed my phone wasn’t able to be fixed to 100% but I appreciate the honesty and integrity of the staff at Fix It Right. I hope I don’t need repairs on any of my electronics but if I do, Fix It Right will most definitely get my business. Great customer service is almost obsolete and I’m very happy I’ve found a place that not only stands behind their work but goes beyond expectations to serve their customers.</Review></record></dataset><record>

Definitely recommend this place! Very friendly service and fixed my phone on the spot. The man took probably max 10min. My little sister's iPhone had cracked and I saw this business on Facebook. So I gave them a call and the price to fix the phone was also extremely affordable. Very worth my time & money.</review>

Wow! My first experience at FXitRight was Awesome! I came across this business on Google and I thought I'd give them a call. They had professional phone etiquette as soon as they answered. Once I was given prices I was so exited on how affordable it was to fix my iPhone 6. When I got to the location I was so amazed at how quick they took care of me. Only 15 minutes and my phone was alive again! FXitRight is defiantly a place that I'll continue to visit! Two Thumbs up!</text>

I dropped my Samsung Galaxy S5 and Brian fixed it that day and placed the tempered glass on it. It looks fantastic! My girlfriend brought her IPhone 6 in for the tempered glass and it looks great.

<text>They really care about their customers and is willing to work with you. The price is competitive compared to the rest of the chain retailers and kioks at the mall.

I got my iPhone 6s screen replaced three weeks ago here and within a week the screen started to separate from my phone to where I can see sunlight between my phone and the cheap screen. At times, the creek would even recognize my touch. I went back in to have Josh the technician look at it and hopefully fix my screen and he and the receptionist immediately started telling me that the issue was due to physical damage and that they would not honor the warranty, before they even took a look at it. I am still within the imaginary 30-warranty they speak of and I have not dropped or damaged my phone since I purchased this screen. I totally wasted my time and money. I foolishly trusted the company and I will never go here again. I would advise anybody who likes to spend your money wisely, to avoid this place! Don’t let the fake reviews fool you. The service and employees are subpar and the company is a sham.</Text>

There is no way a screen can separate like yours without physical help. If you had a legitimate issue not caused by physical damage then we would have no problem honoring the warranty.

I was a bit scared due to my previous experience with my screen at another location but  I knew that if she drove this far for a screen i had to check it out. I called to get a quote & right away the lady that answered made me feel so welcomed.  I walked in & with a smile she told me I could wait or come back that it would only take about 30 min. & luckily I decided to wait because she was such a pleasant person to talk to. She actually had me out the door in 20 min & with a complimentary screen proctector! I’m so impressed & will definitely be back because lord knows I will break my screen again.

<Text>Brian is awesome!!! I called earlier today in need of a new charging port for my Samsung Note 3. He bought the part today and installed it in about 15 min for an extremely reasonable price. I couldn't ask for better service and pricing. He is efficient,  effective, and affordable. Thank you, Brian!!!<//Text><user>115190348998960894144<//user>< time>

Brian runs a great business and fixed my iPhone 5C screen right away. I've cracked my screen twice and Brian recommended Tempered Glass which I gladly paid a small amount more for. I highly recommend Brian as the best source to have your phone fixed and protected.</text>

The best prices in Oxnard. He is very professional and honest. He also threw in a free tempered glass. I would definitely recommend his services .
He also gave me a 90 day warranty on the lcd he replaced on my iPhone 5.</Text>

Highly recommend! Walked in, showed them the problem and had my screen replaced within 30 minutes. Forgot the guys name but he was really chill and professional. I'm definitely going back and getting my little brothers and sisters iPad fixed! If you need any type of repairs done to your phones or tablets make sure you pay them a visit!< /Text>

Brian the owner is very knowledgeable in phone and ipod repair. He's done 3 separate repairs for me. 1 on a  ipod 5 and 2 on a iPhone 5s. 110% satisfied every time. Friendly and fast service. His prices are the best in town. I would absolutely recommend him to any and everyone.<//review>

<text>Brought my phone here a while ago it was  a Moto x pure waited a few days when she got the part she tried to repair it and she texted me that she couldn't fix it that she didn't have the right tools for it she offered me a refund or to take the screen so I took the screen instead of the refund and told me that there was another phone repair place nearby so I went there  the guy told me  that there was one or two stripped screws so I went back to the lady that fixed my phone and asked for a refund again I'm never going there again</text><pics>None</pics><response>{'time': 1594128096970, 'text': 'Your issue was that you want things too quickly'}</response><GmapID>0x80e84c31eecdacfb:0x4f8201fce3bb4909</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

My Daughter cracked her iPhone 6. I googled places in Oxnard and came upon fixit right and took her phone in. Josh was there to greet me. He was a very nice guy. I didn't think there was hope for this phone but he looked at it and said"No Proplem". I left the phone with him and picked it up one hour later and it was good as new! I will definitely use him again if needed and strongly recommend him. 😀< /Text>

Came in because Verizon wanted to charge me $150 to transfer data from and to my phone after resetting it.. I thought it was outrageous. Came in to FXitRight, Samantha was really friendly, and said sense she didnt have much to do she ould do it for me. ONLY $20!! Thank you Samantha you were amazing i will definitely tell my co-workers to come see you if they have any issues. Thanks again.< /Text>

Josh fixed my iPhone 6s with a messed up screen. Said he ordered me a new screen went back and said I came to late that I needed to wait until they restock. Explained to him I was going to get rid of the phone and he, himself GUARANTEED ME to bring my other device and he will fix it for free instead of the iPhone 6s.<//text>

<Text>I was looking around for a spot to fix my cracked screen (which sprint wanted to charge me a ridiculous amount just to replace) I found Fxitright and they were the best deal.. I had some shopping to do so the girl Sam helped me out and stated my phone would be ready in an hr. I told her call me if done sooner 20 minutes later got a call it was already fixed (awesome if u ask me cuz I was in a hurry)  She gave me a great deal also on a screen protector and everything. No need to go thru insurance when I can just get my phone fixed here customer service is amazing and prices are great!!! id recommend this place to anyone looking for friendly young cute faces and great prices ..; Thanks sam for taking care of me.. :)</Text>< Pics>

Literally brought both phones back to life in one day. Very genuine person that no doubt is never trying to get over on his clients, extremely affordable, and very convenient. Precise with his craft and never doing any kind of shady business, I already referred 3 ppl to him and they all are over ecstatic at his work and we'll anybody reading this will be satisfied with his work when you walk into his shop in oxnard. Go find out for yourself, talk to Brian right now and get fixed right what you can't live without! Thank you fxitright< /review>< user>

So they fixed her screen and LED. I went back because my moms screen was coming up. They said all they needed to do was put more adhesive so the screen. They said they needed to do a diagnostics on the phone. Idk why they needed to because her phone was working perfectly fine. We left her phone perfectly working with them we went back the next day and her phone wouldn't even turn on. Her phone was charging, getting calls getting text still even tho her phone and LED was Broken. They broke my moms phone trying to say it might've been watered damaged. We went here to fixitright and even if it's watered damaged the phone should be showing some type of life. It wasn't. NEVER go to uBreakiFix. I don't recommend it. I reccomend coming here to Fxitright. They are very understanding and straight up. They do a great job. Reccomend coming here. :)</review>< pictures>

So My phone got messed up for New Years Eve due to me dropping it so it crack and went black. On New Years I was calling and going to different places To Get my phone fix but all the places where closed such my bad Luck. The last place I call was Brian place I was happy it was open cuz I needed my phone fix ASAP! Brian explain to me they didn't have the part for my iPhone 5c but their looking at every place he even went to Camarillo to look for it. I saw the Motivation and wanted me to get my phone that day but due to been New Years everyone was closed I was a little bumb out due to me wanting my phone lol but I understood the situation. But I'm also thankful that Brian let me borrow a phone Jst incase for and emergency he didn't have to let me borrow it but he did to me that said it all that he values his customers and thank you for that. I got my phone back the next day and I was very please with my phone. This is my number one store I'm going when I need my phone fix Thank you Brian.<//Text>

<text>So let me start off by saying, fxitright should be the first and only place you go to for an iPhone repair. PERIOD.
I cracked my screen, and called several different shops after going to the Apple Store. The Apple Store said it couldn't be fixed and I needed a complete new phone that would cost 250. (Ridiculous) several other shops quoted me $150-180. But each shop swore they were better than the other. I was looking for a deal bc for 175 I could get a new phone w. My insurance. I came across Fxitright Brian answered I told him my problem and quoted me $105 over the phone as long as I made a review on Yelp regarding my experience. He said he wanted to know good or bad how my experience was. I liked that, it said something about his character, like regardless he needed to know.
I told him I would be in after 10 if he could please message me the address. I had a text the second I got off the phone. (Efficient)
I showed up, it wasn't hard to find and he told me that he thought it was for a 6 not a 6 + but would honor the price. He didn't have a black screen but could get one in a few min and the phone would be done in 45 min. I sat on the couch and worked on some things while they worked on my phone. By honoring the price and going out to get the right screen in a matter of minutes it should me the type of Business he was running. HUMBLE, PROFESSIONAL, HONORABLE, EFFICIENT, and CONFIDENT.
He had an apprentice working w. Him, he explained what he was doing, to him and had him help out.(very hands on) He assured me he was very smart and had been doing this for a while.
I like when someone is so confident in they're work they're not afraid to share knowledge. About 30 minutes into it he offered me a tempered glass protector for an additional $10. A discount w. the service. I like that he was saving me money t mobile sold me the same thing for $50!!! (That got returned) In total I paid $125. $115 for the service w. Screen protected and $10 gratuity. My screen is better than ever. And I'll definelty be referring to fxitright.
Brian is great at what he does, uses amazing quality products. He's so confident in his work he gives a warrantee. He made sure I knew if there was any problem to not hesitate to call him and even if my screen protector got scratched or lint under it he would replace it at no cost. You can tell he goes above and beyond and puts more into his work than he may get out. FIVE STARS I'D GIVE 10 IF I COULD!!!!
THANKS FXITRIGHT, BEST PRICE IN TOWN!</text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1450250539369, 'text': "Wow Liz this is why I love my business.

We came here to get a battery replacement and the phone started acting up even worse a month or so later. We went to another place to get it fixed again and they said the battery was just taken out and put back in. Do not come here they are the worst.<//Text>

(Translated by Google) I do not recommend this place to anyone, Brian is a person who does not mind damaging your iPad, iPhone, Samsung to change the parts with other devices that he is composing. He is very despotic. I brought him an iPad Air to repair the Screen that was broken took a month to deliver it to me, but I rendered it useless. In short, do not go to this place because it is not the right place to repair your phone. It's one of the worst places in Oxnard.

Este lugar no se lo recomiendo a nadie, Brian es una persona que no le importa dañar tu iPad,iPhone ,Samsung para cambiar las partes con otros aparatos que está componiendo.Es muy déspota.Yo le lleve un iPad Air para que le reparara la pantalla que estaba quebrada demoro un mes para entregármelo.pero lo dejo inservible. En resumen no vayan a este lugar porque no es el adecuado para reparar tu teléfono. Es de los peores lugares que hay en Oxnard.< /review>

Walking to the Sephora kind a like a little gross make up pallets weren’t that clean it was really dirty the colors were intertwined and I wouldn’t feel safe even having a tester put on me to match me to my color but overall the staff was friendly they were helpful but I was just such a little chicken and couldn’t find nothing because it was kind of all ewwwwwwww<//Review>

I got up early because I know they are always short staffed and I’m always struggling to find someone to help. I got there a few minutes after opening and sure enough it was not busy yet. One of the staff started helping me and as soon as another customer came and asked for help, she began helping her and I was left there hanging needing a lot more help and totally lost. What bothered me even more was that it seemed as though she took a lot more time and care with that customer. I wasn’t going to take more than 15-20 minutes. I just needed a color match , a primer, and something to contour with. I needed advice and help and got there early to ensure I would be helped and just got pushed to the side. I ended up getting products that were not of my liking. The cashier advised me if I didn’t like the products I could return them. Sure enough I ended returning 2 of the 3 items I bought. The same cashier that told me it would be ok to return if I didn’t like the products seemed to get upset at me because I returned them and seemed to want to make me feel guilty that I did ! It was a bit awkward. They just werent the right products. I wish I would have just gotten better assistance. I would rather drive far to the other Sephora in town than go here when it’s literally 2 blocks from where I live. Just left a really bad feeling.<//text>

This is really one of the WORST sephoras you can ever go to. You walk in and the energy is already super off. The only guy that works at the store, I think his name is Robert, he is very very rude, not approachable and very stuck-up. You cannot get help from any employee without getting a sigh, an eyeroll, or they completely ignore you. It is so unfortunate because I live 5 minutes walking distance from one, and have to drive 15 minutes to another one just to avoid bad customer service. Truly do not recommend. It has been like this for YEARS. HIRE NEW PEOPLE.<//text>

<rating>1<//rating><text>This place needs to fire everyone and start new because every single visit no matter who is working it's the same thing. Rude and unprofessional employees. Every experience I have had there is just awful which is unfortunate because either I deal with it or drive it a further location because it's clear whoever runs this location doesnt care. The visit before this last one I went in for an eyebrow pencil. Grab it stand in line and wait forever no greeting no I'll be right with you. Eventually the girl helps me and while I'm paying is putting returns into a basket. She gives me my receipt and goes back to what she was doing. I never got my pencil. I start looking around thinking maybe I misplaced it and nothing. They see me looking and no one offers assistance. Eventually I say I never got the pencil to another worker. The one who checked me out says "I gave it to her" I say "nope you didn't I dont have it" she looks around then in her return basket and sure enough the exact pencil and color I bought is on top. They dont give it to me they call security and make me stand there for 10 mins while they review their camera and eventually realize she never gave it to me. Pathetic! Today I go and grab $200 worth of product and go to pay..there is a woman behind me just cleaning up. She sees me says nothing, I look around ..wait..wait and then say "excuse me is someone on the register" her response is " I just got here I'll be right with you" I was so annoyed by her response.. like wth does that matter!?! I told her " you can acknowledge me and say something , and I dont know when u come in what does that even matter " just the worst people and obviously not very bright who work there. This is pathetic jc penny and sephora< /text><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

Without fail, it’s every single Sephora inside JCP I have ever been to. If you need anything, drive the extra few miles and go to a real Sephora. They actually take care of their customers. I have spent $3000 this past year there and they wouldn’t even let me exchange a $45 foundation that I had a skin reaction to. I will never ever spend another dime in a JCP. Not for their god awful, poor quality clothes or their BS sephora.< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

I called back hours later and the same person answered the phone she still didn't know what the schedule would be, once she called her manager she said that the time I requested they didn't have anyone available to do it, I asked what would time slots they had available and she still had no idea.

Sephora employee actually raised her voice at me in front of a bunch of people to reprimand me because I opened the top of a box to peek inside to double check it was the correct shade. Even my family waiting outside the store heard her! So incredibly rude!! Never going back to this Sephora again!!<//Review>

< Review>
I came in today to this location and one other time and omg! The service is as horrible as the first time. They have the worse customer service ever the employees are snobs with no cause lol they're rude they try and sell you whatever!. Things that are not even relevant to what you are looking for. I will seriously never go in there again. If you are looking for a sephora in chula vista the one. To go to is at plaza bonita mall and otay ranch town center (if it's still there). I have never had a bad experience at either they have always given me the best customer service. This sephora was just convenient to walk in to I was walking by after having lunch with my sister but never again ugh<//Review>

Worst customer service! I asked for a sample of Bare Minerals primer, the bottle was empty and he scraped  my sample from the inner tube pump!  I told him I didn't want it and he said " ...it's the same thing..." Rude and condescending!!! I just went to the Regular Sephora store...</review>

<text>(Translated by Google) This place is a disaster there are no products stored and many you have to look for yourself in the drawers, apart from being dirty. The girl had good attention but the man who is is rude and unhelpful. I do not recommend this branch at all. Better to go to a real Sephora 📍🤨

Este lugar es un desastre no hay productos acomodados y muchos los tienes que buscar tu mismo en los cajones, aparte están sucios. La chica tuvo buena atención pero el hombre que está es grosero y poco servicial. No recomiendo para nada esta sucursal.

<Review>Mostly great experience with them for example the cooked meals, tortillas, deli, cheese of all sorts and the butchered meats.  The worst part of this place is partially not their fault, it is the produce vegetables like the cucumbers tasting like chemicals even after washing thoroughly and cutting off the skin🤢🤮, not sure who they get their vegetables from.<//Review></record>

Food is great,  but the cashiers are not honest at all. They overcharge you as adding a extra soda you didn't even have  it's not the first time they do that. 3rd time and I decide to say something,and she quickly apologized. People make sure you pay for what you bought. Do the math before paying with your Visa.<//Text>

<review>Great selections and hard to beat their prices for fresh meat and also produce. They're located on Main St. Their parking is kinda janky so just be careful! They also have a resturant attached facing main and it taste really good and authentic or as well as super affordable. Once again, prices are hard to beat.</review><user_name>Tru Hannah Robinson<//user_name>< pics>

It was a nice stop to enjoy Newport. We enjoyed the shaved ice with vanilla ice cream. I enjoyed the manjo, and others had grape and cherry.</Text>

Had a great bike ride from Huntington Beach to the Newport Beach Balboa peninsula. Stopped here to grab a bite to eat and was pleasantly surprised that they carried a New Mexico Chile hamburger which was quite good. I had their combo which added fries (cooked to a nice golden brown and had a crispy exterior with a soft interior) and a fountain drink. While this was not fantastic, it exceeded my expectations of tasteless food by a large amount. We were fortunate enough to sit at one of the benches on the grass and could view the beach, people watch as countless people strolled along the pathway. Between the food, Beach, and spectical of people watching, I was highly enamored during my visit.</text>

A little pricey but balances out when putting into consideration the real estate value and views. Enjoy some classic American fast food on cement benches while people watching and taking in where sand meets sea. The Double bacon cheeseburger hit the spot by also adding grilled onions. The strawberry shake was a sweet beverage straight from heaven!<//review>

<Text>Today, my son went to order two orders of fries. My son came back with one order of fries and I have been buying fries from them for about 1 year. My son came back with one order of fries and then I went to go back to them and the employee started lying to me that they changed the size of the fries bag and he gave me a little bag of fries as a joke too. He tried laughing in front of my face and lie too.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< gmap_id>

Had the bacon cheeseburger. Bacon was hard and old, bun was stale, meat tasted like costco food, I basically had to pick it apart. I didn't even get to the tomatoes and lettuce under the meat because it was too soggy. 8 hours later debilitating stomach cramps...ER visit. Food poisoning!< /Text>

<text>Super delicious "silver lake burger"! I asked no onions but still received lotsa onions on my phone order. (It was EMPTY when I went 130pm so I'm surprised they messed it up)

Didn't care bout the lingering onion flavor cuz it was still tasty. NO NEED for fries cuz burger is so big. Had a caramel malt with it- that's all u need for avg stomach size.

Yes InNOut is cheaper, but they don't take phone orders or offer same variety.< /text>< response>

We ordered food for a family of 4, and it took probably 25 minutes to receive our food (they were not busy at all - I think 1 person was in line in front of us).  When we did receive the food, they had messed up my husband's order, which he had made sure to repeat to them prior to ordering to ensure they had it correct.  It took another 10 minutes to fix his order (which was really only adding bacon to a cheeseburger).  I ordered the turkey sandwich with green chilies.  The sandwich looked like a kindergartner had thrown it together.  The lettuce was wilted, and the cheese had crusty dried out edges like it had been sitting in the fridge uncovered for a few days.  Very disappointing.  The burger was good once we finally received it, but overall, this place left much to be desired.< /review>

<user>110758223800379346466< /user><review>Told me on the phone they could install a steering wheel. I ordered an upgraded wheel from the dealer and brought my car in. The replacement part was identical, just going from rubber to leather wrapped.  They told me they could NOT do the job after I showed up with the non refundable part. The reason they gave me was "safety issues" and the airbag might not deploy. So you're telling me as a collision center you've never had to replace an airbag or steering wheel? If this was the case why wouldn't you just say that up front? I would have some serious concerns about the competence of this shop before having any work done here.< /review>< user_name>

This place is a scam I took my car to get repair they charge almost 3,000 dls and they could even replace the front bumper and they also charge me for a headlight and after time I notice it was yellow they just clean the headlight and lied to me about putting a new headlight, I went back to talk to them the Manager David is very unprofessional and mean he never try to help me or nothing. So customer satisfaction don’t matter to this company I will tell everyone to don’t go to this place.
I will also report them to consumers relations.
If I could give a 0 stars to this place I will do it but there’s not such thing</Text>

Update: changing it from two star to one star. Paint from where I was hit is peeling off. Out of their warranty so I have to pay this this repair.

Took my car here after an accident, it took a week longer to repair than quoted due to what they say is a back up in their paint shop. When car was returned to me, several issues were wrong. Such as loud wind noise from driver side window and bumper guard has air bubbles. Had to bring the car back for another week.< /review>

Had a minor accident and my insurance sent me here, I was initially concerned the pinstriping on my hood would not be replaced,  or would take much longer, but they repaired all the damage and had the pinstriping done on the new hood with very little additional wait. I picked up my car this afternoon and am very pleased with their work. I will not hesitate to recommend them or use them myself in the future.< /text>

I took my Mercedes there  because my car was vandalized  to get a estimate my insurance company Geico told me to go there to meet with a Jeff he took it to the back  I left it over night yes I did get a rental car with Enterprise but that is another story..
Jeff called me the next day late in the afternoon it was a Friday. I was trying to get ready to go to UCLA my daughter was sent there from here Bakersfield so I went to pick up my car They made me wait the Jeff the Geico guy was gone so I took the car home it had water dripping from the bottom the kid that gave me my car was nervous. When I got home I saw the side passenger window was cracked.. I new Jeff was gone so I waited until Monday to call him I told him about my window and the auto door won't close.. I asked him if they locked the keys in the car and used a Jim slim he nervously said I don't think so and said I check into it... well this was in June or July and I haven't heard from anyone there... I haven't called them because our daughter passed away so I haven't been myself..</review>

<Review>We went to Neira's for extensive auto repair after an accident in 2012, and they did a wonderful job. They were so friendly and accommodating to us, and completed high quality work in a timely manner. We recently had to have our shield replaced on the same car, and even though I don't think it was completely covered by our warranty, they quickly replaced it without charging us! By the way, this required obtaining the  part from the Toyota dealership, and they still got it done in less than one full day. On top of that, because we live close to the location we used, Sam offered to give me a ride home AND to drop the car off to us when it was finished! When I asked what we could do to thank them (including writing a review), Sam simply said, "Nothing, we just really appreciate your business." We couldn't believe it - it's so rare to have a business selflessly go so far above and beyond for its customers. Needless to say, we'll be using Neira's for ALL our future auto repairs, warranty or not!<//Review>< date>

I would first like to say the work done on my dad's car was simply amazing. However, when we arrived the girl at the front dest was on her personal phone and looked up at us and basically ignored us. A lady that sits in the back came from her desk and ask us how we were doing and could she help us. She was very nice and happy. That's where the good customer service ends. The girl that was on her phone was suppose to call us. She never did. When we told her she never called us. She lied and she did. She is mean and had no respect for the customers. I called for updates and she acted like I was taking up her time. When we came to pick up the car she was eating at her desk. How nasty is that? Isnt that what a break room is for? Once again the lady that sits in the back was there and help us. The work that they do is great and comes with a lifetime warrenty. But if I was the manager I would serioulsy make some changes with the staff.<//text>

My insurace sent me to them to get a quote for repairs on my vehicle.
I decided to go ahead and have them make the repairs after i was quoted.
I took it in on my scedualed day to start repairs (on a Wensday) They told me that it would be done on Friday. Dont get me wrong i know this isn't garunteed however no one called me on Friday to tell me that my car in fact was not going to be done. I called and the lady i was talking to told me that it looked like it wasnt going to be done until Monday but she would have to have somone call me back. NO ONE called me back and that afternoon I called back and they said that it for sure was not going to be done but it should be done on Monday.
On Monday I called to see what time I was going to be able to get my car and she said that it looked like it was not going to be done until Tuesday but again she would have to have someone call me back to let me know for sure.. NO ONE CALLED. I called that afternoon and asked once again, when I would be able to get my car and she said she would have to check and get back with me. She also told me that they have to submit a new quote because it was going to be more than origianally quoted which i think is BS and if it would have effected what i had to pay I would have told them to shove it! I asked to speak to her manager and when I did speak to the manager he basically said theres nothing he could do about it and unapoligetically said he was sorry nobody called me this whole time. Finally on Tuesday I was able to get my car when they were closing and I was in a hurry so i didnt look at it too much. When I was at home the next day i noticed that there was what looked like wax residue all over, it also looked as if they took it threw a drive-thru car wash which I DO NOT do or they washed it with a dirty towel. It has little tiny scratches ALL over it from that. The car was dirty when i took it in but if I knew they were going to wash it like that i would have asked that they didnt wash it. Its only 6 months old and a $60,000 Car and now it has little scratches all over it..<//text><Resp>None<//Resp><rate>1<//rate><username>Mersadies Gunter</username><gmap_id>0x80ea6aa358af6d81:0xa45f9195a51bc624</gmap_id>< pics>

Son had car repaired there, Neria's Collision Center was all about trying to milk his insurance for every last penny. They wanted to change his leather seats out because of scratches in them, except he had has cloth seats. I will never use this establishment and would definitely not recommend it, just due to the extreme length of time of them having his car let alone the dishonesty.< /review>

They got me for $9.99 after telling me my card was declined and to run it as credit (which was also declined). However, at the pump, my card worked just fine. When i noticed my pending transactions later that same day, i returned to the store and tried talking to the employee who had helped me. She started ranting and raving that I was out to get her when i asked to see the copies of both declined receipts as she had only given me one. She then proceeded to take the reeceipts out laying them down one by one. Right before the decline which i had a copy for, i noticed the previous receipt was for $9.99. I asked to see the receipt to make sure it wasn't an accidental charge and this employee flipped out. I will never go here again. A few months back the same incident happened to my roommate, same gas station but different employee. They got her for $30. It seems that this is acceptable employee practices and behavior to this Valero owner, shame on you!!!!!</Text><date>1581201744554<//date>< Resp>

Margarita was all syrup and sugar. I ordered the taco salad because it looked fresh (seeing someone else order it), but it was all mush, definitely made from canned and packaged produce. I don't usually leave reviews but I felt sick after eating here, so hoping someone sees this and saves their appetite for anything else.< /Text>

Ordered 2 of each and they'll combine them, so you'll have to separate yourself. Meat was bland but fresh ingredients otherwise. Couple of outdoor covered tables and friendly service.< /text>

We've been coming here for decades partly because of the incredible location but mostly for the food and always friendly service. Hands down the best Mexican food in the area (except for my mother's!). Plus I would take a bullet for their rice.<//review>

Friendly service and delicious Mexican food, family owned since 1967. Ordered the grilled burrito with shrimp. Chips served to start with mild chili sauce.< /Review>

We haven't been here in years ,and the food was just as good as we remember. The owners are very friendly and accommodating, the restaurant and kitchen were very clean, and the food was so delicious! We recommend the Cheese Enchilada. Enjoy delicious food with beautiful ocean views.< /Text>

<Text>We were at Capitola Beach and decided to take a chance on eating at this place.  They had outside dining.  The prices seemed reasonable for this area.  My husband and I both ordered the burrito especial and added carne asada.  The burritos were generously sized.  The food was bland and there was hardly any meat in it even though we each paid extra for it.  Where's the carne?  The so called salsa that came with the chips was more like enchilada sauce it was smooth and had no peppers or onions also flavorless.  Do yourself a favor and do not eat here.< /Text><pics>None< /pics>< response>

Stopped in to have a couple beers, bill came to $10.90. put total on credit card receipt as $13.00 even. I always write it VERY clearly on the receipt. The waitress decided she wanted an even dollar amount I guess because my credit card was charged $13.90! THIS IS THEFT!!!! Yeah it's only .90 cents but IT WAS MY 90 CENTS! i DID NOT GIVE THIS TO HER, SHE STOLE IT! If you don't want to get ripped off, don't go here! Theft is theft! I called and the manager was not in, I will update if she calls me back.< /Text>

<Rating>1< /Rating><Text>On wed night my friends and i went around 8pm for dinner. We walked in with masks, had a table in the corner, ordered and took off our mask to chat, we were chatting in Spanish and we were the only customers. The woman in the kitchen in a mean way told us in English to put our masks on till they serve our food. We had our drinks already, so that was not right! We didn't argue, but no restaurant does that and nor are mean with the costumers.
I asked the waitress to describe the "chiles rellenos" i asked cuz it is misspelled in the menu (its a Mexican restaurant) it's  #chiles not chilli she described them as the dish is known.
But when served them, it wasn't anything like that. It was a bell pepper cutted in pieces under a heavy salsa with chesse. That's it! It wasn't tasty at all, and it was $18.00 per dish.  You can get real chiles rellenos and CHEAPER at El Palomar o Manuel's.
The waitress was very nice, but we aren't going back!</Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

I was their first customer of the day, arriving before they opened at 11:30. Greeted cheerfully by the person who would be my server I was told I could wait inside if I wanted to, so I snapped a few pictures with their permission. The chef was ready to serve before normal opening time and I was able to order quickly from the server, making a couple minor requests outside the standard items that were no problem for them to accommodate. The chips were crispy, sturdy, and, in my opinion, some of the best I've ever had. The salsa, though not my favorite style, was traditional and flavorful. I informed the server that I had a coupon from the "Santa Cruz You're Invited" coupon book, ordered the ground beef chimichanga and nachos con todo with a couple drinks, for myself and partner. The chimichanga was a sight to behold, and quite tasty, though I think next time I'll upcharge to shredded beef or asada. The nachos were the best I've had in a loooooong time, and cooked in an oven without a microwave at any stage. All the food was fresh and seasoned well. Healthy portions, reasonable prices, exceptional service, positive reputation in the community, and likely my new go to for Mexican food.</Text>

Coming from San Diego, I expected more out of a Mexican restaurant, but we took family here for their birthday and the food too forever to come out and the flavors were bland, the Sangria tasted like they poured it from a bottle rather than house made - which is sad - and the salsa at the table was too spicy without much flavor... As in all I could taste was the heat, not much depth. Disappointed. And why would it take 45 minutes for someone to get a shrimp cocktail???<//review>

<rating>5</rating><review>Been a customer since the early 70's.  Consistently excellent food and service over the 45 or so years.  I recently enjoyed introducing a long time friend who is from Michoacán Mexico and her elderly aunt to El Toro Bravo.  Both my friend and her aunt complimented me and the restaurant on the authenticity, taste and freshness of the dishes we enjoyed.  High praise from people who know this cuisine.  As usual the service was top notch and the restaurant was clean.  Dishes this authentic usually come from a home kitchen, rarely from a restaurant kitchen.  Portions are ample and reasonably priced.  An excellent selection of domestic and imported beer is available as well as Sangria, Margaritas and a small  selection of wines at very reasonable prices.</review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

My Dad and I stopped by here to catch a late lunch.  In the summer, parking is challenging enough to keep me away from here but this time of year it is pretty easy to park within a reasonable distance.  We both had Huevos Rancheros with over easy eggs.  They were delicious with the eggs done perfectly.  I definitely recommend El Toro Bravo if you want a very traditional Mexican meal served by friendly staff.  Prices are friendly too.<//text>

I went there and they charged me 30$ for two super burritos one with steak and one with chicken and they marked the one with chicken with an s so long story short I spent $30 for two burritos and I didn’t get to eat cause the one I ordered was eaten before we realized they marked it wrong.<//Text>

<Review>WORST BURRITOS!  Just ordered a chicken burrito and a beef burrito to go....the food fell apart while unsrapping. My burrito was half wrapped and cold. (Out of the fridge)! Cheese not melted even.
My nephew says "it's like they put soup in a burrito."

Shame, thought it would be ok. Maybe next time...not really gonna be a next time.< /Review><userid>113161025649138849177< /userid>< time>

< Review>
Our families favorite place to eat in Capitola. Great food great service. I love the camarones am mojo de ajo. That is shrimp in garlic sauce. Onlyq thing I would wish for since i have to watch my carbs. Is to use this garlic shrimp in a large main course salad.<//Review>

<Review>I have to start this review by saying, humbly, that when it comes to Mexican food both north and south of the border I have some street cred. My first trip to Mexico was in 1959 when I was 8. During my college years I would go down in the summertime to stay with family friends. Cooking is my hobby. My avocation. And food history and food science are things I love to read up on. Additionally, I helped research and recipe test The Tex-Mex Cookbook.

So. I was curious to see how Cal-Mex differed from the Tex-Mex I know very well.

Mark Twain had a famous saying that the coldest winter he ever spent was a summer in San Francisco. Supplementing that, I say that one of the finest Tex-Mex enchilada combo plates I have ever had was in Capitola, California.

This enchilada, with its use of Monterey Jack and Cheddar cheese as a blend produced a spectacular enchilada. And the chili gravy, which was very mild, unsalty and roux-like without a heaviness from cumin was delicious.

I so thoroughly enjoyed my combo plate here that I had to write this report.

The recipes, I was told, came from the grandparents' generation. So this is historically significant Mexican food from California.

Mark Twain 's famous quote was "The coldest winter that I ever spent was a summer in San Francisco". Well, I now have a supplement to that. "The best Tex-Mex enchilada that I have ever had was in Capitola, California". It was a religious experience. And we came across it by chance.

Now, I have to explain. I am, in all modesty, sort of a knowledgeable Tex-Mex geek. I have travelled in Mexico throughout my life as we have family friends in CDMX. In more recent years, I recipe tested for a friend's cookbook on Tex-Mex. I have a collection of vintage retro restaurant menus and memorabilia dating back to the early 1900's. And am pretty comfortable around the whole spectrum of Mexican and Tex-Mex food. What I loved about El Toro Bravo was that the chili gravy was very mild. It wasn't burned. It wasn't overly cumin-y or salty. And I learned there that I truly like a combination of cheddar, Monterrey Jack and American cheese results in a very gooey, melty mess of a cheese topping. Here in Texas we typically don't add Monterrey Jack. The default is the Kwik-Melt or American or sometimes just cheddar.</Review>< pictures>

<Review>(Translated by Google) All right. In front of the beach, although they took an immensity in bringing the food. Normal prices pulling to high. We had to wait and there were not many people in the place

<text>Requiring you to pay for a membership and a day pass on top of it to skate at a "public" outdoor concrete skate move is the most Santa Monica greedy move out there. Don't waste your money there are amazing places to skate all over LA for free.< /text>< Pics>

<Review>The 2nd best skate park on the Westside of town. Rick and the staff are cool. The cove doesn't allow scooter teens like the Culver City skate park, which is good cause they don't share the same ethics and respect like skaters do.</Review></record>

<Review>I go to this skatepark with something other than a skateboard (scooter) and they guy at the front desk said that is is only for skatboards, yet the whole point of a skatepark is for all skate disciplines so if I were to choose, NEVER GO HERE for anything outside of a skateboard. I have alot
of skill of my scooter and I am pretty upset that I don't get to pursue that hobby. LA is known to scooter and BMX people as the worst place to do it. Allow scooters and bikes and you will (maybe) get a five star</Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None</Resp>< gmap_id>

<Review>The cove is not free but you can buy a 3 month pass, or a year long  pass for $150. I personally think it is totally worth it because it is big and it is safe for beginners.< /Review>< name>

I think a $16 registration fee and $5 at the door is pretty expensive.</text>

I like pools, don't like paying but when I'm in town it's perfect, open late, no scooters , bikeless too. Paying sometimes keep the bullshit rifraf out of park, stoners better blaze b4 hand, and it's next to an AA, NA group,<//review>

This skatepark is obviously for locals only. It cost $16.50 to register. Why the hell would I wanna pay that much to skate and wear pads when Venice Skate Park is only 10mins away? Screw this place.<//text>

(Translated by Google) Really cool. Right on the venice beach. Always something to see. A great place. And also perfect at sunset. The skaters big and small have what it takes.

<rating>4< /rating><review>(Translated by Google) Skatepark in very good condition. It is mandatory to wear a helmet and cover your knees and elbows (it can be with long garments). If you forget your helmet they can leave you with lost property. It is not excessively big so avoid going when there are many people. 3 bowls of different levels, a street area with a quarter.

(Original)
Skatepark en muy buenas condiciones. Es obligatorio llevar casco y cubrirse rodillas y codos (puede ser con prendas largas). Si te olvidas el casco pueden dejarte de objetos perdidos. No es excesivamente grande así que evita ir cuando haya mucha gente. 3 bowls de diferentes niveles, una zona de street con algún quarter.<//review>< Pics>

<text>(Translated by Google) An incredible place that fully breathes the Californian spirit.

I can only recommend this place, we get lost very quickly watching skaters of all ages, all styles ...

Go ahead and enjoy life!

A nice, intimate little spot to grab a drink or play a game of pool. Bartenders are knowledgeable and make a good drink, if a little strong. There is a nice outdoor patio area, and a back room with air hockey and more pool.</Text>

<review>Kind of a unique spot. It is in an old building not too far from the srjc. It is In  an old Victorian house, and the top part sells pizza and pasta, among other things. The pesto cheese bread appetizer was fantastic. At night, it shifts more into a bar scene, with the bottom floor opening up, a bar starts serving cocktails,  and it gets more lively. A fun place to stop by on a weekend night.</review>< Pics>

This is my favorite Bar! The owners and staff work very hard to make the environment friendly and accepting. They have a pretty large area outside which is enclosed and typically has heaters running to make the patio comfortable and fun for everyone. The Bartenders are friendly and pour great drinks. Security is friendly and helpful. And here's the great thing...... want some barfood? JOEYS PIZZA IS RIGHT UPSTAIRS! they are always walking around the bar and serving DELICIOUS pizza and wings! They are such a friendly addition to the staff at "the Bel"! Stop by, play some pool, and have a drink, you just might see me there!</review>

Best bar for pool and cool (people) in Santa Rosa. Staff is great, owners are cool, and drinks/food is fantastic. Many regulars and staff have stayed for over 20 years! That speaks for itself.< /Text>

Where to begin.. old fashioned pool bar I suppose. Always a relaxed enviornment at the belvedere.  Crowd can be anywhere from early 20s-x but it is always a good time. Awesome food from upstairs and a full bar will result in a good night. 3 pool tables inside of the lobby. Only place in downtown with nice tables!<//Text>

Cozy, dark bar, feels like it's mostly locals. Was able to order a tasty pizza from "Joey's" upstairs. Friendly, fast service. Nothing fancy. A few patrons appeared to have been over-served. Pool tables and a juke box.</text>

It has good vibes and great service by all the staff. The fact that it has a pizza/ Italian restaurant on top of it that you can order from while at the bar is awesome as well< /text>

People were friendly, but the service was slow and hard to come by. They don't have beer on tap, but they do have some good bottled beer. We sat outside, which was nice, but the tables were dirty. Overall, it was a pleasant dive-y spot and the pizza was tasty.< /Text>

Favorite bar, hands down. No other bar like it in town. Dark, cool, pool tables, patio and unique comfortable vibe. Plus great food and great bartenders.</text>

<review>Clean, good atmosphere, plenty of room, indoors and outdoors, friendly, feel safe, nice area, good response from employees, things to do besides just sit and drink a nice place to gather and bring friends, seemed well managed, good selection of music, casual but like a place you should dress up for. One of the better places in Santa Rosa.<//review><Rate>5</Rate>< Date>

Drinks taste right, you can smoke all night, the billiards are cheap and competitive even though the rails are all shot dead, it's a bar that has a full pizza restaurant menu and you can touch the ceiling, what else did you want?< /Text>

<Review>Awesome staff, great mixed drinks, enclosed outdoor seating with heat lamps, 3 pool tables, table hockey, bar seating with TV view, pizza place upstairs that you can order and eat from Gary's. Gets pretty busy at night, popular for the locals.</Review><time>1484593469890< /time>< UserId.>

<rating>4<//rating><review>Ohhhh, the Belv. You know what it is. It is what it is. Staff are the best here. Aaaaaand when I used to smoke it was the best place to drink and smoke, but as a non smoker now, it's hard to be here for too long. This isn't a fancy joint, but it's a great place to drink and meet with friends. Also the pizza from upstairs is pretty bomb-tastic.< /review><username>Robin Blaney< /username><response>None<//response>< Time>

DON’T waste your time! I ordered a bedroom set online in the beginning of November, supposedly it arrived damaged. I call them in January to ask where it is and get that answer they didn’t even bother to reach out to me! Here I am at the END of April, it arrives and I walk in store to schedule my delivery. At the time of scheduling NOTHING was on the schedule. Boom 1-3 on Wednesday. Clear out and clean/sanitize my whole bedroom and then... Girl at the store just called it’s almost 2pm now to tell me they’re short staffed and their only truck is in yuba city!? Not my problem! I told them to keep their stuff if I can’t get it today. Seriously just a mess. Absolutely disgusted! I can’t believe this awful experience!!!< /text>

I fell in love with a bedroom set and decided to buy it. The employees were very rude especially kayley. In addition when the furniture was delivered it was used and floor model mattress instead of the new merchandise that I purchased. They tried to swap me and make me pay full price for a used item. Needless to say I will be getting a refund and will never use this place again. Bad business as well as shady practices.</review>

<Text>This place isn't Worth the time, cause Rent A Center doesn't give your money back on returned products...
They aren't worth even one star, but had to or i couldn't rate the service
Plus tax rents our broken furniture I bought a bed and 3 weeks time it broke they are very dishonest store.
Please don't buy anything from rac.<//Text>< UserId.>

<Text>We went there for the dessert 🎂, we had heard the pink champagne, strawberries, German chocolate were pretty good, added their Moonstruck chocolates. We got few slices of the cakes. They are quite generous in size. I do agree with the hype, they are quite fancy and good. It was just a little too much dessert for one person and it was heavy dessert. We had it pack and have it over a couple of days. I didn't get a chance to try the chocolate 😅.< /Text>< Date>

Had lunch with a friend and have been wanting to eat here for many years now, so glad we finally did!! They are the only place around that offers a Monte Cristo and it was absolutely AMAZING!!

I'm a big, BIG fan of Monte Cristo sandwiches and this one very well may have been the best I've ever had, it was absolutely delicious! It had the taste of high quality ingredients while also feeling the tummy like the best of naughty treats.

I've eaten at Madonna Inn many times and, as usual, the staff are great! Friendly and courteous, very on it every step of the way. The experience of the atmosphere and decor are almost worth the trip alone, you just have to see it to get it.

Copper Cafe also has a huge following for their burgers and my friend said they did not disappoint. It was a very healthy size and she said it was definitely a very high quality and very tasty burger. The fries were top notch too!</Text>

<Name>Linda Wright</Name><text>No signs posted for Cafe or Steakhouse anywhere on the Madonna Inn property.  Just follow the aroma from the food.  Entrances are handicap accessible.  Public bathrooms are behind a circular bar with little passage room and then 2 flights of stairs down.  All first floor restrooms were marked for employees.  Food very expensive.  A coffee the size of a tea cup, and a piece of fruit pie was $14.00.  Good service.< /text><gmap_id>0x80ecf0e7be1bbf45:0xe0cd9cc95c2a9dbe< /gmap_id><response>None< /response><UserId.>110270346610510199714<//UserId.></record>

<user_name>Jeffrey Lin<//user_name><Text>This place is an overpriced gimmick. Came here with the old lady cause she wanted to taste the world famous champagne cake she heard so much. Turns out the recipe she found online tasted way better. Our server looked like he liked the place less than I did. He came by to take our order and then that was about it. The food runner have us better service than the server. Cool place I guess if you like the gaudy feel of a Vegas style themed restaurant/hotel. Otherwise steer clear.<//Text><GmapID>0x80ecf0e7be1bbf45:0xe0cd9cc95c2a9dbe< /GmapID><user_id>116223586383209687243< /user_id><pictures>None<//pictures>< time>

Our first time visiting... and we loved it! Today is my Hubby's Birthday and we drove about 5 hours here from Sacramento just for lunch. It was quiet due to all of this covid,  but we had a great lunch and enjoyed it all. Best part was his favorite Pink Champagne Cake! And it was complimentary in behalf of The Madonna Inn. ☆♡☆ And let me tell ya, it is the best one we've had ever!
"Thank You so much."< /Text>

Great place as always. I learned last night here that apparently this place was also my first ever restaurant experience, a week after I was born according to my mom so I have a lifetime of good memories here. Fantastic service, food, ambience, and pricing. Overall one of my favorite restaurants. Styled after a Swiss lodge</Review>

The grounds were lovely for spring time. We were accommodated when we called just 30 min ahead on a Saturday! And got seated at a lovely window seat. We shared the Monte Cristo, good thing, because it was Big and delicious. Everything, including the bathroom was clean and ready, even though it was clearly a busy day. Very impressive. Kudos to the staff and chefs.<//text>

Madonna Inn's Copper Cafe is a great place to stop in when passing through the area.  Service is great and food is good but on my last visit the coffee had sat in the heater too long and had a burnt flavor.  The Bakery is amazing especially the famous Madonna Inn cakes.<//text>

The service was good for a busy Easter lunch time. The servers were polite, attentive and friendly. I had the cashew chicken salad which was very tasty. The mimosa was very good. All in all, a good dining experience.</review>

I have been making this a destination stop every time I am traveling up the Central Coast. My family and I stop and get cake to go. The cafe is design is incredible wood carvings around the cafe bar to pink sugar on the tables. They have the best cake and root beer floats! Desserts are a must if you are going there. They give you a kettle of root beer, to add extra soda to your floats. Everyone is extremely nice and it's an similar experience to Disneyland. Just go, I guarantee you will love it. I take all my friends there when in the area and each of them has loved it too!</Review>

<Review>They have outside Tent Dining due to Covid. We were still seated next to a large party which made us uncomfortable so we asked to move tables and they allowed us to. The food was just ok. The coke slaw was bad but luckily they took it off the bill.  The salad was not fresh but I didn't want to complain since we already complained about the Cole slaw. The hot sandwiches aren't as I thought they would be..I was invisioning a panini style hot sandwich but instead my turkey sandwich was just turkey on two slices of bread.. not a sandwich at all. The turkey was fresh and delicious and the large scoop of Mashed potatoes that came with it was good as well. Wasn't amazing but it was OK. Husband got the chilli sandwich and liked it. Overall I think the steak dinners and breakfast menu would be better to choose from because this Cafe gave me cafeteria food vibes. Once inside dining resumes I will definitely be putting reservations in for the Dining Room.I give 5 stars because this place is gorgeous and definitely worth the drive. And we always leave with a signature Madonna Inn Glass Cup.<//Review>< pics>

I'll admit it's not quite fair to rate this place given the fact that we arrived right before closing. Most of the desserts were gone and our waitress was not too attentive.
What we did have was top notch. My advice it to get there early.<//Text>

<Review>We were there on a Friday night. Even with lots of parties, there were plenty of parking spaces. We wandered through the Madonna Inn tourist attractions and then sat down for dessert at the Copper Cafe. They were out of the deserts we wanted but the substitutions were delicious.

Madonna Inn is an incredible landmark off HWY. 101,  celebrating 60 years of bringing enjoyment and amazing accommodations to travelers world wide. The Copper Café and Bakery is part of the Madonna Inn nostalgia, offering incredible bakery goods, pies and cakes for special occasions and more. We just stopped by today and grabbed a slice of cherry pie that was to die for. While we waited, the staff were bringing out cakes that looked fit for royalty. Can't go wrong at the CC&B. Enjoy!</Text>

The food is good but the decor is why you have to eat here at least once in your lifetime if you are traveling along the central coast of California. It is as if you entered a time machine and were shot back to 1960's California. The Copper Cafe’s design and appearance is a combination of the set inside the bottle in "I Dream of Jeannie" with the interior of a train in the "Wild Wild West."<//Review>

With covid, currently ordering inside (or by phone), and self-seating in outdoor tent - which had some decorations. Guessing that prices have increased to make up for added expenses. I got the Ruben Sandwich, which was about $20... It was definitely not as good as I hoped for, but not bad (no thousand island, not particularly large, and pastrami wasn't well peppered). Chicken Ceasar salad was good. Still glad they decorated for the holidays. Have had better meals there in the past and figure it's tough right now...<//Text>

It's the Madonna Inn! It's fabulous. We love the hot turkey open faced sandwich and mashed potatoes... Is a treat year round. The salads bread and butter are a perfect starter or their soups. I really love the way the have used their parking/driveway for out for dining. But before you leave, make sure you go upstairs to the shops. We always start our Christmas shopping there. The staff are the best!!!!!</text>

Ordered steak sandwich, medium, got over cooked piece of meat on bread.  Nothing else except fries. Very disappointing for $30+.</Review>

<Review>Good bathroom stop while road tripping. Finally ate here -- Thanksgiving dinner! -- and was seated immediately at the round bar. Ordered off the special holiday menu and shared the turkey dinner with someone else -- and we were both full. The inn is a thing to experience -- I recommend just stopping by and checking it out if nothing else.<//Review><username>Renata Martin< /username>< Pictures>

<text>This pretty much historical landmark has been a staple on the 101 for many decades. The Madonna in is one of those places that everyone must stay at least wants. The restaurant has fantastic food and wonderful wait staff. Deafening tape time to walk around and see all day have to offer. Going to the gift shop and buy yourself some mango pepper jelly. You'll thank me later. Also, stop in at the bar sit on a pink swivel chair and order yourself a drink lol<//text><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None</resp><gmapID>0x80ecf0e7be1bbf45:0xe0cd9cc95c2a9dbe</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

This place is a rare jewel. Let me tell you, you won't be disappointed. With all the scrumptious cakes you can find, all in one spot!! Make sure to pre order your cake if you plan on taking a full one home a day ahead of time. You can purchase slices there. But their cakes go fast!!! As they should. The service there is always on point. Very polite and welcoming.<//Review>

We had a great breakfast at the Copper Cafe and bakery. The service was great and the atmosphere was casual and fun. I loved the different color goblets and the decor. The portions are huge and filling. It was a bit pricey for breakfast, but otherwise awesome. Will visit again!</review>

< review>
Recently dropped in to buy a cake for a friend’s birthday after being exposed to the Madonna cakes last year at a party. Impressive to say the least.

We were looking for a 6” diameter cake but they were packed and not selling whole cakes this weekend. No worries though because they sold everything else by the slice.

These slices of cake were HUGE! We got 4 which was honestly a whole small cake equivalent. Mykalya and Roxanne helped us out. Friendly, helpful and fast. We were in and out in under 5 minutes with Chocolate cakes in hand.

The cake tasted great and I’d love to see what all of their cookies taste like next time we are in town!<//review>

They are a little pricey, but the portions are huge! They have an extensive menu. I love the black forest cake and pink champagne cake.<//text>

Made reservations through their website, showed up for my time slot and they acted like they'd never heard of the term "reservations" before, thank heavens I had taken a screen shot of the confirmation! Food was blaaa, service was slow and the price was crazy high. This has done downhill...<//text>

Top quality food and service, our waiter seemed to magically appear just as we would need something. Have been going to Madonna Inn's Cafe since our wedding anniversary 30 years ago. It's still as beautiful now as it was then!</Review>

I go every year to get my birthday cake fix, not to mention spa days with my mom, sister and niece and my favorite memory of my wedding day... of course the steakhouse is my all time favorite place to sit as far as decor, but copper cafe is still great. They have a great Monte Cristo sandwich that I just can't find anywhere else around here.</Review>< pics>

I love stopping at the Madonna Inn when traveling through SLO so I can visit the Copper Cafe! Talk about atmosphere! It has been a favorite spot for me since my first visit at age 8 with my uncle who took me to see their restrooms downstairs! ( A waterwheel 'flushes' the urinal that is designed like a panning slough in the Men's Room! Ladies room has adult and child size toilets with solid wood carved doors for each stall! Lots of hand-painted Italian tiles everywhere!)

The cafe has individual hand-painted murals in each alcove booth where the seats are all tufted red leather and the tabletops are full sheets of copper with hammered symbols along the edge that match the theme of the mural (e.g. crossed pick and shovel for the gold mining mural). Same for the curved copper-topped counter! With red leather stools and hand-tooled copper footplates at each barstool that is intricately designed to follow the theme! The wait staff all dress in period outfits to make you feel you are in a stately Austrian Mountain Lodge.

Their food is delicious and reasonably priced. The sugar on the tables is pink crystals! The water glasses are heavy colored glass (red, purple, pink, blue, green and clear) with a lovely 3-D image of roses. The opulence is rampant everywhere, and is beginning to show it's age, but as they upgrade, they always go for efficiency, classic design, and high-quality. And it doesn't stop there! They have a bakery inside the Copper Cafe with amazing CAKES!

They've toned down the pink and gold that would've made Liberace feel right at home in the main dining room for a more modern feeling of an inside garden party look.<//review>

<text>I’m always so impressed with the efficiency they display at our group banquets. I’ve been attending different functions for more than 40years and they never disappoint. The servers are well trained and it shows. Calm, relaxed and caring. Just had a function in late February and I was so impressed once again for their service.
Can’t wait to get back outside and go eat. I will make the Madonna one of my first destinations.</text><GmapID>0x80ecf0e7be1bbf45:0xe0cd9cc95c2a9dbe<//GmapID>< date>

<Text>First time eating here. My wife had the Monte Cristo which came with 3 jams/jams (strawberry, boisenberry & apple I believe) and I had the Reuben with fries. Both were very delicious, flavorful and not as greasy as other versions we've had elsewhere. My only real gripe was the amount and size of the flies near our original table by the windows where we were seated. Even though we asked to move they were still annoying us and the staff didn't seem to really acknowledge it.</Text></record>

If you go for fast service on weekend don't go!
Waiting for more than an hour to pick up our order when they told us 20 minutes.
Had to cancel the order.
The inside is dark and gloomy that is why we decided to pick up our order and sit outside in the parking lot turn to sitting place, not very pleasantly, and after one hour wait when they told us another 20 min we just canceled.

Outstanding meals,
Little on the high end of cost, but if you don't like it,
Go to MickyDs and eat barf for $10.<//Text>

Champagne cake is the best for special  occasions.  The price per piece  keeps going  up and the slices are thinner than ever! Always a busy place.<//Review>

Loved it. I've always wanted to visit The Madonna Inn. My husband and I decided to stop on in and I'm so glad we did.
The bakery is right at the front door. Full of cookie and cake goodness.
The wood carving all over is great! The bar area is round and a good size. The restroom, you have to go down some stairs. It was kind of creepy. I wonder where people go if they're in a wheel chair.
All the tables in the cafe have pink napkins and the famous colored goblets. They were so cool. They have them in almost every color of the rainbow.
I ordered the chicken curry soup. It's more like chicken with gravy soup, but it was still good. Not spicy at all. I wanted to get some dessert, so I bought some cookies instead. I got the lemon and the Angel cookies. And the heart cookies sprinkled in pink and in red sprinkle. They were all Sooo good.
After we went and explored the big dining area, which leads to another bar with a huge fireplace and reading chairs. So cool. We went upstairs to the gift shop, bought some things and then headed out.
My husband said well stay next time. So excited about that.
If you are passing through San Luis Opisbo, this is a must stop, even just for a cookie. Look around, take pictures and all that good stuff. Or stay the night in one of their themed rooms. I doubt you'll regret it!!</Review>

First time eating here. My wife had the Monte Cristo which came with 3 jams/jams (strawberry, boisenberry & apple I believe) and I had the Reuben with fries. Both were very delicious, flavorful and not as greasy as other versions we've had elsewhere. My only real gripe was the amount and size of the flies near our original table by the windows where we were seated. Even though we asked to move they were still annoying us and the staff didn't seem to really acknowledge it.<//Text>

If you go for fast service on weekend don't go!
Waiting for more than an hour to pick up our order when they told us 20 minutes.
Had to cancel the order.
The inside is dark and gloomy that is why we decided to pick up our order and sit outside in the parking lot turn to sitting place, not very pleasantly, and after one hour wait when they told us another 20 min we just canceled.
Drove to downtown San Luis obispo and had an amazing time.<//Review>

< Review>
The food and service were fantastic, but man, is the decor ever dated! I've driven by the Madonna Inn for many years and on a whim, decided to try it. First impression: Like I'd been taken back in time to the '70's. Next impression: VERY nice, polite and helpful staff. Then I was returned to the modern era when their reservation system needed my cell number for a text when my table was ready. I did not see that coming.

Beyond the archaic decor though, everything was fantastic. Our hostess was a sweetheart, our server was spot-on when needed and the food came quickly and was VERY tasty!

Once past the culture shock, this is a very good place to eat! 😋</Review>

The food was solid. The customer service was solid. The place is very unique. The men's restroom is world class. Check this place out if you're sound the area. They also have a supercharger if you have a Tesla.</Text>

We stayed at the Madonna Inn for a bachelorette party. We ate at the Copper Cafe for breakfast. The cafe is pretty crowded so we made reservations ahead of time. I was impressed by the speedy service and the little Madonna Inn touches. Even the sugar was pink! The food was a bit pricey but was adequate. But who's really going for the food?<//Review>

Nice environment and old style, historic eatery. However, the food is not that great, service is slow and the prices are sky high. We'll go again while charging our Tesla but won't expect much.< /Review>

We ate breakfast at the Copper Cafe, simply because we'd traveled to the local town (5 minutes away) for dinner the night before.
Breakfast quality was good. Not great. Just good. The decor, the ambience and the fashion of the waitresses is what you go here for. All in all, my wife and two young kids thoroughly enjoyed the entire experience. Would've been five stars if the quality of food was better and in line with the cost of breakfast.<//review>

Gorgeous place. The chocolate chip cookies we got saved the road trip. The cakes we tried were beautiful and tasted awesome. I had the turkey dinner also and it was everything I had hoped for, so delicious!< /text>

Still want the kitsch of Madonna but without the price tag? Breakfast is good, and the coppertop surfaces are cute. Also... Those chocolate truffles!< /text>

Besides being a super fun place to visit with all the unique aspects to the Madonna Inn, the food at Copper Cafe is fantastic.  The Monte Christo sandwich was huge and full of meat and cheese, deep fried to perfection. The Pink Champagne cake was not only pretty in pink but really tasty.</text>

Well that you can do at the Madonna Inn copper Cafe very easily. I had a Monte Cristo sandwich I've had them at Disneyland I've had them at other restaurants and they were amazing this was like eating a limp spaghetti noodle for lack of other words it was very soggy and very messy. I got fruit instead of the French fries and the fruit was the best part of the whole lunch. I also got it piece of the toffee crunch cake back in the older days like a few months ago they used to smother it with toffee shards and on the side there was toffee shards this one here was a little dry there was hardly any cake there was mostly the whipped cream in the middle and hardly any toffee. And for some reason they put almonds on the side crushed almonds on the side not toffee. I don't believe I will go back there for food or even cake it truly wasn't that good</Review><response>None<//response>< Rating>

My parents got their wedding cake here. Let’s say it was so good my dad and stepmom didn’t have any because it was all gone. Also the cookies are amazing! Highly recommend the Almond cookie and Angel cookie. Lemon coconut is more coconut than lemon and is pretty great too, and honestly at 85 cents a cookie it’s inexpensive and totally worth it to buy each flavor to try them all and buy the ones you like best. Staff is always friendly. Kinda crowded as it’s right by the entrance, I always feel in the way when ordering but doesn’t stop me from going back,<//Text>

<Text>The Madonna is a MUST see location. If you can't afford to stay there or dine in their main restaurant, I recommended giving yourself a nice self guided tour of the place and eat at their coffee shop!

The staff is wonderful and welcoming. Exploring the venue is encouraged! Look at the bright pink main restaurant, bars, dance floor, fireplace, gift shop and don't forget the basement restrooms (a must, trust me)!!!

The coffee shop is like diner food. The food is average and it's pricey for what it is for sure... but it's worth it to sit down and enjoy the scenery. There is a book about the place they sell for $50 but you can bring the restaurant's copy to your table and check it out while you dine. It's super cool. The food is a 3, but the grounds are a 5+, which is why only 4 stars since this review is supposed to just be for the restaurant.

A MUST see!!!< /Text><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None<//Response><Gmap_id>0x80ecf0e7be1bbf45:0xe0cd9cc95c2a9dbe<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Someone said come here for the cake and the cake is what I came here for! Since were in the area and just finished dinner, we decided to come here for dessert. We got the pink champagne cake which was recommend to us and it was really good. The slice is HUGE! Totally shareable among 3 people which we had. The pink champagne cake is a white cake with Bulgarian whip cream filling. The cake was light, fluffy and moist and the whip cream was really good. There was a bunch of while chocolate shavings as well that make the cake super filling. The nice thing was that it wasn't too sweet.

Overall, good cake. Dine in for a cool decor and ambiance. I totally wanted to take one of the goblets home (but you can get them at the gift shop... of course).< /review>

Best hash browns in San Luis Obispo if you are a breakfast person. Been coming for years. Food is always fresh and well prepared. Staff friendly. For a higher end place they really should upgrade their coffee. Lots of local roasters that could supply them with some fresh ground french toast or something. FYI also a great bar- drinks are always made very well. Little more expensive than some places for drinks but you get what you pay for.</Review>

Exceptional service, beautiful quirky atmosphere, excellent meals (tri tip and chicken salad are yummy!) and cake to die for. Find out all about the Maddona family, unique glassware (and purchase one to take home if you like) and the dream come to life that is Maddona Inn. After eating, take a stroll through the complex to small gift shops and a colorful secret garden before you hop back on the highway.  Or spend the night.< /Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNFSWq1PP6QCl_tl8HG31jSV0lfTkPfH49G1qKh=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< GmapID>

Very good traditional breakfast menu. The multi-grain pancakes were moist and hit the spot. They also have a bakery on site that was pumping out some amazing looking cookies and other pastries, but did not a chance to try. I also recommend getting a biscuit.<//Review>

I got the hot beef. It was made from real tritip, not that fake deli roast beef every other restaurant uses.  The cherry pie used tart cherries, not the gloopy canned cherries.  Overall the food is fantastic,  it's a fantastic atmosphere, the service is great,  and it is fairly priced.  And you have to check out the world famous mens room in the basement of the main entrance.<//text>

Copper cafe is so picturesque! As you walk up the delightful aromas from their bakery wave at you.  The decor is reminiscent of a danish/Disneyland storybook land..The food is good and the prices are great...their service is very friendly..usually after we eat we visit the gift shop and i buy the goblets in all arrays of color! I have a collection at home.</Review>

Madonna Inn. Great food. Great service. Fast service. Best cake in the USA. Great drinks. Best Ice Tea. Great breakfast, lunch, and dinner. You cannot go wrong here. This place is what all restaurants wish they could be. The food and ambiance makes this THE place to go in San Luis Obispo County. Note they have 2 restaurants... 1 is the Copper Cafe that is more of an everyday mealtime with incredible food. They also have a more fancy restaurant best for formal dining and date night. Both are AWESOME! Same menu if you ask for it. They also have live bands many nights (blues, jazz, and other softer but sometimes boody shaking music for both young and old).<//review>

Everyone raves about the cakes and they do look pretty but it tasted like it came out of a cake mix box.

Other food was pretty good, but nothing worth remembering.

The atmosphere is still worth seeing though as it's very fun and unique.<//review>< Pics>

Meh. Arrived at 4pm. Ordered two Madonna burgers, special raviolis, and a steak dinner. The burgers and steak were ordered as medium rare, but arrived well done. The regular fries were way overcooked, but the sweet potato fries were good. Ravioli was not impressive.

Food took about 25 min, which is surprising for such an early dinner. The cafe was dingy.<//review>

<response>None</response><Review>Often times, when you return to a place of your youth, the trip only leads to disappointment. Rarely does the  modern incarnation live up to the image in our heads, softened with time.

Returning to the Copper Cafe after nearly fifteen years, I did not have that same reaction. It was great! From the decor to the service to the food, my expectations were met at every turn. If anything, the experience was better.

The corned beef hash is some of the best. And you have got to love the raspberry jam offered. Not just the plane old grape jelly in single-serve containers, but a dish of raspberry jam. Apricot too! The selection of coffee drinks and hot cocoa rival most coffee shops. Make sure to use the pink sugar!

All in all, this place doesn't just rely on gimmick, but on great food and service too. Very much worth the visit.< /Review>< user>

Who would drive 3+ hours for cake?  Traveled here from the Bay area just to have their cake, it is that good. Their service is friendly and prompt. Took cake and cookies home.  Of course we had lunch there, it is a long drive.
Their sandwich's are very good and tasty.  Go there!< /Text>

Copper Cafe has so much to offer. I love there hot turkey sandwich served open face with mash potatoes and smothered in homemade gravy. But save room because they are famous for dessert. Pink Champagne Cake, Black Forest  Cake, Lemon Coconut and many others  you won't be disappointed Madonna Inn Copper Cafe delivers every time.<//text>

Was exceptionally busy so make sure you make reservations if you can to avoid a wait. We made one same day without problem.

Everyone raves about the cakes and they do look pretty but it tasted like it came out of a cake mix box.

Other food was pretty good, but nothing worth remembering.

The atmosphere is still worth seeing though as it's very fun and unique.<//text>

Stopped at Madonna 2 weeks ago with my family for cake, just want my kid to get to experience Madonna cake. I am always enjoyed going to Madonna cafe but this will be my last time there. Lady who helped us so rude and seemed like we were bothered her for just a few questions about cake. The way, she looked at us from head to toe, we didn’t dress up because just came back from beach, just short and t-shirt. I don’t know we need to wear suit and gala dresses just to buy a Madonna cake.
I almost walking out but just didn’t want to upset my kid because we promised her a birthday cake from Madonna. Worst experienced ever!< /Text>

Beautiful place! Had the Camelot burger special with sweet potato fries. Mimosa was okay, Bloody Mary was very good. The black forest cake was dense and dry, would not get it again, but the pink champagne cake was fantastic.</Review>

<Rating>2<//Rating><Text>Meh. Arrived at 4pm. Ordered two Madonna burgers, special raviolis, and a steak dinner. The burgers and steak were ordered as medium rare, but arrived well done. The regular fries were way overcooked, but the sweet potato fries were good. Ravioli was not impressive.

Food took about 25 min, which is surprising for such an early dinner. The cafe was dingy.< /Text>< pics>

This place is hard to accurately describe... The opulence of Graceland coupled with the decor of a Brothel is probably as good a description as any. In a word, tacky. Actually in two words, VERY tacky but I digress. After your eyes adjust to the dim lighting, they are unapologetically assaulted by the color pink.

As bad as all that was, the food and service made it worth every minute.

There were 15 of us that came on Mothers Day. The place was a zoo but they treated us super! They had our table set up in no time and our waiter was right there taking drink and appetizer orders with a jovial spirit and a big smile. When we got our food orders everyone dug in and enjoyed their choices. I don't remember what everyone had but as usual I of course had the Reuben. It was just right. Tender meat, not too saucy, just enough sauerkraut and bread that wasn't too soggy or hard. I couldn't finish it and I think everyone took something back to the hotel with them.

All-in-all this was a good place to eat, don't be in a hurry, wear some sunglasses and for goodness sake, try the Reuben ;)</Text>

<Review>Although everything we've ordered at the Copper Cafe has consistently been delicious, two of the main reasons we've been coming here for three decades are their coffee (which comes from Appfel ... a must try) and the unique ambience created by the copper top tables, luminous stained glass windows and custom woodwork.

I find that this place is expensive I had a Monte Cristo it was $18 and I got fruit instead of fries it was very soggy but the fruit was good then we got a piece of cake I feel that the cake is good but it's not like it was before I got the toffee crunch cake and there was very little toffee on it before the whole side was full of toffee and the inside seem to be more cream then cake</Text>

<rating>1</rating><Text>My husband and I stopped here for a quick bite in between lunch and dinner. We both ordered salads, I ordered a half veggie sandwich. It took over an hour to get our food. And once we did finally get our orders, the bottom slice of my bread was so soggy it fell apart when I picked it up. The server was very nice when I asked her for a new piece of bread. Then to top it off, there was a hard stem from an avocado in the sandwich that I could have cracked a tooth on if I had bitten it. Luckily I didn't, and I just felt it in my mouth.  The service has been consistently slow every time we have come for dinner in the past year as well. I think we are done with madonna. The novelty isn't worth the poor service from the kitchen.<//Text><pictures>None</pictures><response>None</response>< gmap_id>

<text>I'd been craving a Monte Cristo sandwich for weeks. My last visit I got my fix. The Madonna Inn and Copper Cafe are a local treasure.  If you're travelling in or thru the area,  it's worth stopping in.  I'm a local and still I like going into the Cafe for a great brunch or lunch.  Try the black forest cake for a desert.<//text><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><gmap_id>0x80ecf0e7be1bbf45:0xe0cd9cc95c2a9dbe</gmap_id></record>

Our wait person was great. The Christmas decorations were beautiful as always. The food was acceptable. The copper cafe however was dissapointingly messy! We saw  3 visible overflowing trash cans. Food, napkins, lettuce and silverware on the floor. Exposed shelves in complete disseray and dirty dishes left on tables. I'm sure if Mr. Madonna was still alive he would not approve!<//Review>

Tonite my family and I went to the Cafe to grab a quick dessert and coffee. Yes we were a pretty large group... but we were celebrating GRANDPA'S BIRTHDAY.  Well at our arrival the manager, He was very nice and welcoming... but our server was horrible.  She was pushy, rushing and seemingly bothered serving us... i wasnt sure if it was being uncomfortable under  pressure.  I spoke with her briefly after our dessert and let her know that she woukd not be receiving a tip larger than $5 because the desserts weren't worth bragging on and her (Customer Service) was  far below ratings... then following our conversation, she admitted that she had too many tables, and this was her reason for being very unprofessional, unfriendly, inattentive and rude.  At our leaving, she and other servers gathered in a group and was eyeing us as if we were the problem... Mine own experience  at this Cafe and from all adults in our party of twenty people agreed and will chalk it up to say... Madonna Inn's Coffee Cafe has lost 20 future guest...   ~Chef Nina<//text>

Their cakes are disgusting, I really don't know what the fuss is about. You can buy way better cake at Safeway for half the price! A slice of cake costs $9. I ordered champagne cake and black forest cherry chocolate cake. Both of them were disgusting! The table I sat on was fithly, they never cleaned after the customer before me left. The employees are weird, they litterally followed me from one side of the cafe to the other and made sure that I should make a purchase. The Cafe smells like rotten milk! To top all of this, me and my friend got food poisoning after eating their disgusting cakes! Also, their coffee is terrible as well.

The Copper Cafe is inside The Madonna Inn in San Luis Obispo.  It was alot of food and very delicious.  Extensive Menu and the waitresses were very friendly.   The Christmas Decor was beautiful.</Text>

<Review>I've been buying cakes and visiting this business for quite some time (years even) and I must say today was one of the WORST experience I've ever had!   I stopped by the bakery at a  little before 2 pm and the boy at the bakery was busy trying to get one of his colleagues attention rather than focussing on the customers.  He did not acknowledge the guests and when it was time to service them, he was slow, unprofessional, and unproductive. Every time I visit this place, my experience keeps getting worse and worse.  Customer service is terrible and my overall experience was not worth the aggrevation.  I've dinned here as well and sadly to say the customer service is not good, food is sub par albeit it being pricey.  If it wasn't for their cakes, I would NOT visit this establishment at all!</Review><pics>None< /pics><Response>{'time': 1546469611510, 'text': 'Hello, and thank you for your comments, L.

A cafe unlike any other. The Monte Cristo is a must and the unique honeycomb cake is difficult to find anywhere else. From pink champagne cakes to rock candy stir sticks, the Copper Cafe must be experienced for oneself.</review>

<Review>The Madonna and and The Copper Cafe are Icons of San Luis Obispo. They are simply must see and do once, at a minimum. The Copper Cafe is quite touristy, loud and cutesy. From the uniforms of the waitresses, to the never ending wall decor, and the pink, and more pink of the whole place. The menu is simple and straightforward traditional. I have had breakfast here many times, and it is always good. On the last trip it was lunch and the club sandwich was you standard no frills, but has everything club sandwich.
The bakery that is part of the Copper Cafe has the Black Forest Cake, that is a very long standing favorite cake. To view the cake is a joy, and the chocolate on top always gets attention. Walk over and check it out, or notice them on the way in, depending on the door from which you entered.
As is the case for all who visit, tour of the bathrooms is a part of every first time visit. It has been the custom for over fifty years to my knowledge. (my first tour was in 1971)
Next be sure to visit the shops up stairs because they are there and enjoy to overview into the big dining room of the steak house.
If possible a Christmas visit is a joy to see all the decor and decorations.
This is just one of the things you do in San Luis Obispo</Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Date>

<Rating>4< /Rating><review>A friend and I stopped here on our way to Hearst Castle. We were told my multiple people that it's a 'must-see' and I can definitely see why.

The cafe (and I'm sure the actual rooms in the inn) had very ostentatious, medieval style decor. Everything from the pink glasses, napkins, and menus to the carpeting and curtains.

My friend and I split two sandwiches.

Beef BBQ: the beef was thinly sliced and very tender, albeit salty. I personally like salty food, so it was fine with me, but my friend pointed it out. Luckily, some extra BBQ sauce fixed it right up.

Hot sliced roast turkey: now THIS was the standout sandwich. More like an open faced turkey sandwich, it was topped with mashed potatoes and came with a side of gravy and cranberry sauce. It was Thanksgiving on a plate and it was perfect. Order it!

Yes the cafe is a tad on the pricier side for sandwiches, but you're definitely paying for the experience. Great service and friendly staff included! We were sad that we were too full to eat dessert, but there's always next time.< /review>< pictures>

The food is good but the bbq sauce was horribly sweet and not at all Smokey and at cheapest it's $20 per person I recommend the steak house next door it's simply better bang for your buck< /Text>

I thought this was a tourist trap and a crappy place...I was pleasantly surprised! Anne will be back next time I'm passing through slo. I I had the beef au jus sandwich and it was perfect. Highly recommend.</review>

The copper Cafe at the Madonna Inn is one of those places in San Luis Obispo that you really should see. The Madonna Inn itself is quite lovely and the grounds are well kept with lots of flowers. The copper Cafe has a  historic old fashioned carved circular wooden bar which is terrific for taking selfies and a good place for  having a party.

We went to lunch with a bunch of friends and had a festive time.  The food is what they call Casual American fare.  My wife had the Monte Cristo, I had the Ruben. Our table-mates had the shrimp Louie that had lots of shrimp, and the turkey club which looked tasty with a big pile of french fries.

We were there for a birthday and they gave the birthday gal a giant piece of chocolate cake, which we passed around among five or six people and everybody got a nice big bite or two.

The truth be known you really do not go here for the food,  it's a fun place for a San Luis Obispo experience.< /review>

<Review>The Eggs Benedict was great. The hollindaise was rich and creamy and a bit on the lemony side. The ham steak unusually thick.
The service was friendly and fairly prompt.<//Review>< Pics>

If you're coming here for the food, the best thing is the cake. The lattes and hot cocoas both come from a machine and taste very watered down. The vanilla latte tasted like water with milk in it. The waitress said all danishs were special order. (Not sure what that means) so we were unable to order any. If you want to eat in the cafe it seems the only good food is the cake, nothing else is worth the cost (very expensive for the quality). I would only reccomend visiting to see the building itself not for the food.< /text>

Love the inn and go at least 4 times a month. Service needs to be improved as lately it's been less friendly and accommodating (that's why I took a star off my rating).</Text>
