First Security Service has the most reasonable prices. Through a customized security program, they provided a program that fit my budget, and I was satisfied in the end. Am glad I found First Security Services.< /Review>

They ensure that all the employees log in their entry and exit times. The two guards ensure that our company is locked down at the end of the day and that there are no disruptions at night.

One size certainly doesn’t fit all strategy. Nobody gets it better than First Security Services. Seriously, it’s been a steady association that my business has been sharing with their team and true to that, they are simply amazing. The entire team functions as an independent entity – giving you the best security solutions at a great quote. Cheers!<//text>

And of course, provided me with the best manned guarding <//review><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None< /resp><GmapID>0x808f9e57f5b014d1:0x3c610554474905bb<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>
<text>This is an exceptional company that does exceptional work.  I have used them for securing my multiple properties across the city, they handled it all exceptionally well.

<Text>These guards are always tireless somehow. Always alert, patrolling the perimeter, giving updates even when all seems OK to me. Well, I guess that’s how they are trained. I have not experienced any break-ins or burglary since I hired them, unlike what used to be the case 4 years ago.< /Text>< Resp>

They are an excellent company to work with.  The guards are so professional, they accommodate our requests and changing day-to-day needs really well.  The management too is very kind and are usually available immediately whenever required.  We have not had to go anywhere else since we found First Security.</Text>

Issaac from Mosser was so upfront and amazing. He was patient while my partner and I looked at many places. The company is really invested in revitalizing the diverse communities in SF. I am so grateful for his patience and availability! I am counting down the hours to move into our new place. Thanks again! Patrick and Violet<//Review>

It's crazy how many bad reviews are on here. I've had nothing but pleasant experiences, but I guess I'll count myself lucky cause my ordeal has been smooth like butter.

The mosser team I've dealt with have been amazing and extremely helpful throughout my move. Moving is an extremely stressful and depleting event, and so any help is appreciated.

Nico, the leasing agent showed me a property on his day off, and went above and beyond to make sure I was happy. We saw the apartment I inquired about; he saw I wasn't completely satisfied with it and so on the fly was able to show me another one that fit what I needed perfectly.

Nelly, the property agent has been a dream to work with. I'm not sure what her client list looks like, but she answers any and all of my problems or questions with such impeccable timing; you'd think she was working only for me. That personal and quick problem solving she's able to deliver has been some of the best customer service I've ever had. She's delivered keys to me on the weekend (day off) and even answers my texts after what I assume are normal office hours. I feel a little guilty bothering her at all random times of the day, but she nonetheless makes me feel like it's no bother at all. She truly makes me feel at home here at Mosser</Review>

The best customer service you'll get is right before you sign your lease. After that, you're on your own. They're a property management company that doesn't actually manage their properties. Absolutely ridiculous.<//Text>

<Text>The worst experience of my life ever. This company is just a thief and deducted from my deposit after I moved out the apartment. The apartment was smelly and noisy, and I got the contract when I was outside of US. The agent deceived me and didn't tell anything about street noise. Once, I moved in I got the worst experience ever.

When I moved-out they charged me for unnecessary stuff, I left the apartment untouched and even cleaned everything myself the day before move out. However, they claimed for deep cleaning. They also charged me extra money for utilities and deducted money from my deposit. Please don't and NEVER approach this company, they are horrible in terms of customer services.</Text>< Pictures>

I was able to snag a great apartment (in a rent-controlled building, no less) with the help of Mosser Companies. Nelly, the assistant property manager, and Anna, who was my leasing agent, were nothing but responsive, well-informed, and incredibly easy to work with. My unit was just as described, and I couldn't be happier.

All in all, the easiest and least stressful experience I've ever had getting an apartment. Would highly recommend Mosser Companies — especially if you're working with both Anna and Nelly!

Re: the bad reviews. Take them with a grain of salt. If you're  long-time SF resident, you know *every single apartment property* in SoMa, TenderNob, the Mission, the Castro, etc. will have some sort of issue with the homeless and there will be street noise. I knew this going in — which is why I chose a unit in the back. Sure, it dosen't get the most sunlight, but it's ghost-silent inside. I literally didn't know I had a neighbor because of how quiet the building is. Got a great deal on this place, and I plan on staying for many more years to come.</review>

Absolutely terrible! They'll steal your deposit when you move out. Despite paying the prorated amount of rent for the last days I was in the apartment, they double charged me and deducted it from my security deposit. There was also a credit on my account they refuse to refund. I was also charged cleaning and repair fees despite leaving the apartment in immaculate condition after living there for 2.5 years.<//text>

<rate>5<//rate><Text>I lived in an apartment run by Mosser companies in San Francisco's civic center neighborhood. When I moved into the apartment it was perfectly clean and renovated. Had little issues during the year I lived there and management was always quick to respond.

The day time cleaner (I forget his name!) at 146 McAllister is really wonderful. He worked so hard everyday to keep not just the inside of the building clean but also the street outside which, as anyone who has been to the neighborhood knows, is not an easy task. He was always friendly to all of the residents and I just really appreciated him being there.

I had to leave SF unexpectedly due to the pandemic and was in a tight financial situation. Nelly Emiliano was so friendly, knowledgeable and patient in helping me to get out as quickly as possible and severe my lease obligations. She advocated for and followed up with me throughout the process and made a stressful situation so much more manageable. I would definitely recommend looking at one of MOSSER companies many properties for affordable housing and if you run into any issues call Nelly :)< /Text>< Pics>

No, I do and will always plan to make comments about the truths on this company because this is the one source we (tenants) have to communicate and see if there are any related issues pertaining to what's either happening at home or if it's related to a lawsuit filed against this company.

Mosser has been one of the worst companies I have ever had to deal with professionally in San Francisco.

I rented two separate apartments from them both beautifully done on the inside and in prime areas of the Tenderloin...and that was about all that was good with Mosser.

Management of this company is awful, on both a small (property management) to larger scale (accounting). Both apartments my security deposit somehow was lost getting mailed back to me (this is after sending it out after the legal CA 21 days they had). No one is likely to respond to your emails unless you let them know they are in violations of certain rights or constantly add more emails onto chains they are not replying to, and they make sure not to post any of their company info anywhere so you need to contact Mosser Hotels and ask for certain departments.

The apartments are very nice, yet cheaply redone, and overpriced. My second apartment had the oven incinerate on the first use and it took my roommate almost 3 weeks to get Mosser to replace it for us. Ash was still left on our ceiling the entire time we lived there. Work orders will get fulfilled only sometimes. Even after putting in multiple for a raised floor, the issue had never been solved upon move out.

I do want to give a shout out to Junior and Theresa, however. These are the only 2 in 2.5 years that I felt like truly made an effort to help in any way they could! They were both amazing and I hope their hard work, integrity, and honesty is recognized in this company!!!</Text>

<time>1567388175258</time><Rating>1< /Rating><Text>Avoid this property at all cost. The property management is extremely unresponsiveness. Work orders go uncompleted or half-way done, trash area and parts of the building infested with rodents (mice, and roaches). The building is not secure so if you have pets, children, or live alone, this would not be the place for you. Gates are broken, and doors are rigged to stay open allowing anyone to access the building. The laundry room here is coin laundry only but washer water is not filtered and oftentimes, the equipment is not working properly. There are no amenities on the property and the appliances inside the studio and one-bedroom and much smaller than the average stove, and refrigerator. Getting a property management company to answer the phone or respond to work orders can take anywhere for days, weeks, to months.

Pro - the price point for rent is lower than in many places in the area.
Cons - everything else. parking is a bare, building is poorly managed/kept up, there are many code violations here. I would not recommend this property to my worst enemy.< /Text>< pictures>

<Review>Where I live on California street the manager was rude to me in front of my two small kids. I made a simple mistake of not reading the post on the washing machine where it said to start washing at 9am.  I mistakenly started washing at 8am because my kids had no clean clothes to wear. One tenant who lives on the same floor started complaining the washing starts at 9am. I had already started the load and I was very apologetic but the tenant was still rude and started saying my kids were being too loud. The tenant even called the manager on me. The manager was so rude to me in front of my kids he started saying lies that I always start washing early in the mornings and that many tenants are complaining about me and that I’m very close to being kicked out of the place. The manager even said that there is laundry mat across the street and they open at 7am. I wished my kids didn’t witness this now my son is saying why the man was mean to mommy and that he’s sorry for making noise. He saying he wants to move in a a big house where he can play ☹️. There are some people here who are nice and friendly to us but as far as the manager and the tenant who complained that was uncalled for. They didn’t have to be so mean especially in front of my children.</Review>< UserId.>

<Review>Wish I could give 0 stars. Don't be fooled by the seemingly upgraded interiors of the apartments, the workmanship is shoddy (holes in random places where rodents and pests will enter) and maintenance is a nightmare. This company treats is residents as bottomless sources of money rather than human beings. Avoid renting from them!< /Review>< Gmap_id>

I cannot stress this enough - DO NOT RENT ANY PROPERTY THROUGH THIS COMPANY. They have nickel and dimed is the entire time living here. Last month they took out 100$ extra and refused to refund us. This company is dreadful and the people who work for it are borderline incompetent. This place is ran by greedy people who don’t care about their tenants. Not only will they take everything you’re worth but NO UTILITIES ARE INCLUDED. NONE.

<Response>{'time': 1581532234736, 'text': "Hi Monica,\nThank you for your comment. I apologize to hear you are encountering issues in your building, as our company takes resident concerns very seriously. We do have private security at your property, as well as a resident manager present on site, and a Property Manager for each specific building; their name and number is posted in the lobby.\nOur policy is to maintain our residents safety and security inside and on our property first and foremost. However issues around the neighborhood or in the commercial space are quickly brought to the attention of the police; and unfortunately we are all at their discretion for how quickly they can arrive or how they respond.\nAfter speaking with your Property Manager they told me that you they have been in contact Nov/Dec and you didn't mention any concerns. The PM just sent you an email so please check your mail and reach out to them to follow up on these concerns.\nPlease email me at MCsocialmedia@mosserco.com if you have any other questions or I can be of help in any way\nThank you,\nDana"}</Response><pictures>None< /pictures>< userid>

The most horrible experience ever in my entire life... I lasted 7 months out of a year contract!! Not only it’s unsafe, has mayor healthy/ homeless problem ( they enter the building) at all the times there’s no security nor management that cares ... I made a complain and my information was compromise then I started to get harassed by neighbors in the building... Mosser doesn’t care about your safety DO NOT RENT ...< /Text>

I wouldn't trust any reviews over 1 star. The only reason they get a star is because they employ an INCREDIBLE after-hours repairman named Mario Nunez. I cannot stress this enough: Mario is amazing and deserves a raise. Mario gets 6 stars, while Mosser in general gets negative 5... thus balancing out at a net of 1 star. Our building "manager" never responds to us because he's "too busy". During renovations upstairs, they knocked a hole in our bathroom on two separate occasions. Mosser did nothing. It would be unfair not to mention that they replaced the carpets in the public areas and repainted when they bought the place.<//Review>

I have to agree with all the negative comments.  Mosser has a big turnover in staff - unfortunately the people who have left recently have been the best ones to work with.   The management staff still with the company are condescending and do not exhibit very good customer service.    I am very glad that I'm vacating one of their properties</Review>

<Review>I have been unable to get a hold of anyone at the company for the past 3 weeks for the simplest questions and I moved into to my residential unit three weeks ago. I have tried every possible medium of communication (phone calls, emails, you name it, etc) and it's almost like they are intentionally avoiding their tenants needs/requests. It's ironic that they are a rental/real estate  property company and they can't address the simplest questions and requests.its a shame because their properties are nice but once you move it they are indifferent to your needs.< /Review>< time>

HORRIBLE, nonexistent management. In a 12 floor building on O’farrell and the only two elevators BROKEN for 2 weeks! Old people who depend on the elevators for access to their apartments or the outside world are trapped and no one has responded to tenant complaints despite multiple attempts at communication.<//text>

I've dealt with a lot of bad management companies in LA and this has to be the worst. Absolutely horrible communication, because there is literally no communication. They will do everything in their power to screw over and take advantage of their tenants. 0% chance your maintenance requests will ever be acknowledged. Do everything in your power to never live in one of their buildings.</text>

They are impossible to get a hold of, as a commercial renter. Months long redirected phone calls, no follow-ups, no care, little professionalism. We always pay our rent and they are simply screwing us.

Edit: About an hour after posting this review we finally get a call back, after about a month of efforts to contact them.

Edit 2 (7/9/18): We were finally able to get in touch with Mosser and figure out our situation. They had all sorts of staffing issues we were told, and were swamped with work. The new person responsible for our premises was much better in terms of professionalism and dealing with our situation and we found a more amicable solution to our problem.  For this, I added a star to the review. Care is fundamental in every aspect of life and especially in business. I am glad to see that improvements are possible and I hope this is a trend toward increased diligence and consideration of human dignity since at the end of the day it is humans dealing with humans.</Text>

Please, never contact this company. EVER. Win Chen SUCKS!! So UNPROFESSIONAL. A realtor should be on time for appointments , if not ahead of time. And what kind of realtor shows up in sweats , shirt and sneakers on an occular unit inspection?! This is not a marathon. He doesn’t even tell you the complete requirements and demands requirements when it has been emailed to him. Turns out he doesn’t open his email first before opening his mouth. And what kind of realtor doesn’t know how to open a simple password encrypted email?!. The Win is a BIG FAT LOSS. Thank you.<//Review>

BE AWARE!
This company is one of the worst in San Francisco.
They taking over the city and now even LA, they need to be regulated!!!
Very inhuman staff that all they care is money money money.
You can forget about getting any responds for your basic rights.
All the comments that you see under the reviews are just to pretend to be responsive buts its not the real case.< /text>

Great Game Stop. My son was admiring the latest DOOM game preorder sign and the cashier offered him a promotional cut out from the game. They go above and beyond here. Bought my switch and all the games for it here.<//review>

Wanted to walk in and get a game but walked out within 30 seconds, gagging. Seriously, get that smell figured out. I don't know how anybody can even work there.</Text>

<Review>Stock was minimal, and the unit was very small. The unit next door is abandoned and has a septic leak. The entire store smells like a sewage leak. It's obvious the owner doesn't care and is minimally involved. Worth the drive to Roseville if you're going to spend more than a few minutes inside.< /Review><pics>None< /pics><Response>None<//Response>< gmapID>

Decent stock. I recommend looking online for your game to see the price and location first if there is something you know you want for sure. I had a specific game in mind. I googled GameStop and typed it in. It showed that this location had a great used copy and it was in stock. Cool! I drove over and bought it. I do wish the staff was a little more regular and informative. For people who are very into gaming, we appreciate good staff and quick help. I often have questions or am looking for certain recommendations. They don't always have that. For a small location though, they are good.< /text>

Tried to get the animal crossing switch that just came out.  My local GameStop had no extras and was told to call auburn.  They said they had extras and that they will be released at 9 pm so I would have to show up early to get in line to have a chance at one.  I showed up at 6:30 to get in line and was informed that they had all been sold at 6:00 and that I was too late.  Why was I told that they are going to be sold at 9?  I called the day before they were released.  Very upsetting to have to drive an hour just because someone lied to me.< /Text>

Placed an order last night to pick up in store. Waited for email to let me know product was ready for pick up. I called  and spoke to Jeremiah to make sure it was ready and to make sure when they close since hourse have change due to virus. Jeremiah told me that they would be closing at 4pm today. I said thanks and made my way to Auburn. Coming from Folsom I was absolutely upset to get to Gamestop and see a sign that said closed for the rest of the day. I got to the store at 3:20pm. If he was planning to close early why not say so when I called at 2:20pm. A waste of an hour of my day and my gas. Please tell customers that have a pick up if you will be closing early. Now I have to drive to Auburn again tomorrow. This is the only store that has the product in stock. Hope this doesn't happen again.</Review>

For video-game and TV-show buffs in Auburn, this location holds lots of value in our lives as collectors, gamers, and fans. Great staff, easy access and identification, and moderate prices. Always great to stop by.</Review>

I bought a used game here and it had paint all over the back and did not work. Then a bunch of the paint scraped off in my wiiu and I had to clean the interior of the wiiu. I will never recommend buying a used game from any gamestop to anyone. I was also unable to return it In the 7 day return window due to some issues that poped up. Until gamestop starts checking the used disks they sell I will not be shopping there.<//Text>

Game stop is an awesome place where fellow gamers like me will enjoy the content they can purchase in the store and on the website.< /review>

<Review>So I got a phone call on the 23rd concerning my ultimate edition of red dead redemption 2 preorder letting me know that they were doing pick ups at 9pm on the 25th. Unfortunately I had to work late that night and most of the morning on the 26th. I go in today to pay of the remaining amount as well as trade in a few extra games I had laying around. Just to find out they have no ultimate editions in the store, according to the clerk none came in at all and that there was a delay in the shipment. They checked incoming emails and nothing said anything about any delays. So my question is this how did he know there was a delay if nothing was said about it? Why is it that I dropped $200+ on a preorder to pick it up the day it releases and I have to walk out of that store empty handed? Why did the 2 clerks on duty act like this is a normal thing and made no attempt to fix the situation. All was said was "I'm gonna have to write an email about this." When and if they do get ahold of me letting me know it's in the store since I wasted a trip all the way to that store for nothing, I will be canceling my preorders while I am there. Not going to take the chance of showing up again to pick up my game just to find out they dont have any to give out. This is not how you run a store or any business for that matter. This will be forwarded to the corporate level as well.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

Avalon’s pharmacist and every employee that I’ve come in contact with has been welcoming, *compassionate, not to mention very efficient, affordable and professional. Their commitment to educating clients through emails/mini lectures on all ranges of medications and illnesses is admirable.  I rarely rate businesses but these folks truly deserve the recognition. I also get the impression they value and take care of their employees. All around a GREAT business!!</review>

I love Avalon Pharmacy!  The service is exceptional!  They have gone above and beyond when the doctors office has made errors or failed to send an electronic prescription.  Five years of doing business with this pharmacy and i have absolutely zero complaints.  If you are not using Avalon, you are not getting the best customer experience!< /text>

< Review>
Avalon Pharmacy is my preferred pharmacy for several reasons. First, they hustle and get your prescription ready fast so you can pick it up in the drive thru in a timely manner after your doctor visit. Second, the staff is friendly, knowledgeable and efficient. Third, it's easy to re-new prescriptions over the phone. Fourth, the pharmacy may be small inside, but the selection of stuff they have on the shelves is very good.  Fifth, they have home delivery for medicines. I have not used this service, but think it's a good service for the local community.  I highly recommend Avalon Pharmacy in Yucca Valley.< /Review>

<review>I called my Doctors office to request a refill for one of my prescriptions, I was told I still had one more refill, so I called Avalon Pharmacy and the automated (IVRU=interactive voice recognition unit) states I do not have any more refills left. However, I was given the option to call my Doctor myself or have Avalon call my doctor,  I chose the later.  One hr. later or so, got a call from Avalon: "prescription med is ready for pickup" . OUTSTANDING!! a seamless process with availaale options to chose from. Thank you Avalon!.</review>< Pics>

I started coming to your Pharmacy, because my Grandmother needed me to help with her care and this is where she came. I lost my Grandmother in 2014 and by that time I'd fell in love with your staff and your service. After my daughter was murdered 2 years ago, I could hardly face anyone. Your staff heard about it on the news and in our local paper and everyone went out of their way to make sure that I was okay and to see if I needed anything. I can not begin to tell you that you are not only my Pharmacy, but a family to me also. Thank you for everything.<//text>< user_id>

<Text>Amit Kakar at Avalon Pharmacy is one of a kind. We’ve worked with Amit for nearly a year now and we can’t say enough good things about how he runs his pharmacy. He is compassionate, knowledgeable, and genuinely cares about his patients, staff, and vendors. I personally love watching his weekly “Minute with Amit Videos” where he shares weekly tips on everyday common questions that someone might have for a pharmacist. It’s brought a lot of comfort to my wife and I as we’ve safely navigated our way through COVID19. If you live in the High-Desert near Yucca Valley and you are not using Avalon Pharmacy, then you are missing out on receiving some of the best patient-centered care and free prescription transfer and free delivery. We highly recommend Amit Kakar and Avalon Pharmacy! Truly a 5-Star Service!<//Text>< pics>

I have been a customer of Avalon since I moved to Yucca Valley in 1998. Yes, I could save some money by using my insurance preferred pharmacies however, caring customer service is priceless and that is what I have always received at Avalon.

<Review>Avalon Pharmacy has been my pharmacy since we moved here to Joshua Tree 17 years ago, and I have never once considered taking my prescriptions anywhere else.   Everyone there is (and always has been, as people come and people go over the years) so friendly, helpful,  and knowledgeable,  and they are always willing to go one step beyond to keep their customers happy.  The staff functions well as a team,  even with Amit, the pharmacist,  giving attention to any question or situation that a customer may have, each one stepping up to help out the other if need be.  Of interest is that I worked for a local doctor a few years ago and Avalon Pharmacy was one of the easiest and most pleasant pharmacies to work with from that side as well.  If you're looking for a place to get Rx's filled, looking for information on medication interactions,  or looking for a place to get up-to-date info on the coronavirus (yes, really), Avalon Pharmacy comes to you highly recommend by me, for what that's worth. 😁👍💊</Review>< UserId.>

I get my sister's meds from Avalon, and if there is an issue, which is rare, Avalon's staff solves it quickly. I get my meds from the VA, but if I didn't I too would be a customer of Avalon Pharmacy. They go far beyond the norm to meet their customer's needs.<//Review>

Fast precisely filled orders. Customer service includes communication to Doctors office, and insurance. They even deliver.
If the doctor gives you a position that is unique and rare thy are prompt to get it to you.
The staff is wonderful and friendly. Is small town service like hey remember you name.
Now that is full service.</text>

A call in the morning often gets my delivery to me that day, and has alwsys been by the next. We have the payment charged to our card on file, and no signatures are needed since covid-19. We feel a relationship with the delivery personal and love to see them. Very convenient for us, and effidcient for them. No driving for us or waiting in line.  Great people and great service.< /Review>< Pictures>

Every person there work so well together I never worry.  They have my best interest at heart and take every question as important and not mere conversation.  When I ask for home delivery of prescriptions they get here no matter what. There is always a smile when I go inside or pull up to the drive thru.  This is a good, careful and friendly Pharmacy.<//Review>

Avalon pharmacy has always made me feel like a person, not a number. I feel like I get very personalized care at Avalon. They know my name and my prescriptions. They call me when my prescriptions are ready. I feel like I matter to them and that's a pretty rare thing in this day and age!</Text>

Love, love, love these people. They treat you like family and I don't even need to get out of the car. My daughters love opening their windows to say their hellos, while they are greated with smiles and usually a treat. If I could give this place a 10 I would. I have had no problems with transfers, or refills and they are fast.  I will not go anywhere else.< /review>

Best Pharmacy ever, the experience is exceptional, the staff are great folks, always welcoming and friendly. I only can say positive things about.

Thanks for all you

Avalon continues to give exceptional service! Always friendly and courteous, tried other pharmacies before Avalon, the employees were rude and didn’t care about your needs.

I appreciate the folks at Avalon so much that I want to give them my business instead of the prescriptions that are mailed to you every 90 days.

Avalon thank you to all of you for being the caring folks that you are!</review>

We have used Avalon Pharmacy for many years.  They have our prescriptions ready for us every month without us having to call them in each time.  They are always good about changes in medications and let us know all the reactions from them. They also have deliveries if you need it. Very professional pharmacy in a small town. You have to love them!<//review>

Avalon Pharmacy is phenomenal.  They put customer service as their priority. Even if I can’t get there to pick up my prescriptions, they deliver to your house. The staff is always pleasant to talk with.<//Review>

<review>I love this place. The staff is very  friendly and  genuinely concerned about your health.  I can get my prescriptions cheaper through mail order but I like the care I  get from Avalon.< /review><Rating>5</Rating>< name>

<Text>My husband and I have used this pharmacy for over 20 years.  The staff has always been helpful and friendly.  They also process prescriptions quickly.  Although my husband and I are usually not in a hurry to get a prescription, they  usually call to let us know that a prescription is ready  within hours of receiving the prescription, and we pick it up at our convenience usually the next day.  I think this pharmacy is the best in the area.  It is certainly better than any other pharmacy  that I have dealt with when picking up prescriptions for friends.  God bless Avalon.< /Text><pics>None</pics><Resp>{'time': 1547644912541, 'text': 'Thank u, Kim for your kind feedback. We appreciate having you and your husband for the past 20 years.

Amit and Staff are like family to me, such a wonderful group of people! They genuinely care about their clientele. And have seen me through some very serious illnesses in my life. And I always pull through!!! I am blessed to have been in their care since I was 19 years old. 30 years now as of next month 2/7! Congrats Avalon Pharmacy on the many years of wonderful and commited service! I'd give more stars if I could! I love you guys. ~Heather L. Cantu / @Cosmic_Wraith7  ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐<//text>

I like that you fill my prescriptions quickly, and if you have a problem you always notify me. And you notify me when they’re ready. And they always greet me with a smile. Something very much needed nowadays.< /review>

<Review>Avalon Pharmacy is the best Pharmacy I've ever used.  I almost never have to wait in a line or come back later.  If I do drop off a prescription and have to wait for it, it''s a 20 minute wait, not a Walmart 1 or 2 hour wait!
They can deliver to me 10 miles out of town too.<//Review>< Pictures>

Everything they advertise is completly true. I use to hate going to the pharmacy...either your stuff wouldn't be ready for 24 hours or when you showed back up you still had to wait. This place is a jewel! I never mind coming here. You guys do a great job thank you!< /review>

I’ve been going to Avalon Pharmacy for approximately 13 years now. I honestly think they are the best Pharmacy in the Morongo Basin. Friendly staff, it does feel like family.
Thank you to the whole crew for doing such a wonderful job.</review>

I would recommend this pharmacy to anyone, the service is fast with courteous staff.  I have been using this pharmacy for about two years now and would never go anywhere else.  The Pharmacists on duty are very knowledgeable and very kind to answer any questions you may have.  Please check them out and see for yourself!  I personally would like to thank the team at Avalon Pharmacy for all the great service that has been provided to myself over the past years, could not ask for a better pharmacy.  Thank you<//text>

I absolutely love this Pharmacy. They have been filling all my Rx's for the last 8 years.  I was using the other big chain pharmacies and was so sick of the wrong Rx being filled.  I can't have generic medication and every-single refill Walmart and Rite Aid would fill with a generic, I swear every time.  After nearly 3 years of this a friend suggested Avalon.  They even have drive thru. They are even open on Saturday mornings for those of use who work during the week.  I have an excellent rapport with the employees.  No more mistakes or late refills with Avalon.< /text>

I recently moved here and made a great choice in Avalon Pharmacy. The staff is exceptional, always answering my questions and keeping me informed. I have my medications delivered and no matter if it's one or more prescriptions, they make every delivery on time with courtesy. Definitely making me feel welcome and important as a customer. Thank you to Amit and his exceptional staff!!<//Text>

That out of all the pharmacies I have ever had to deal with in this lifetime?
Hands down Avalon and it's staff far exceed the norm in a phenomenal way.
I would love to be able to tell you all the many wonderful things that Avalon and it's staff have done in order to keep my life on track.
And simply put just keep everything like it should be.
Headache free.
I've always figured they must have a zero tolerance margin for error policy because never once have they made me or anybody else I know wait any longer than necessary for medication we are all usually in need of yesterday.
With most places I understand "business is business".
However at Avalon?You can feel the warmth coming off of the drive thru window before you even pull up.As Kelly or any one of Avalon's personable professionals exude from the get go.As you put your foot on the brake and shove it up into park.Because there's comfort in knowing out of the multitude of others that attempt to try and imitate Avalon's natural persona and genuine caring nature?
Ain't nothin like the real thing baby...ain't nothin like the real thing!
Thank you all at Avalon for allowing us all to be blessed with a compassionate answer when you're in need my friends. Because without the staff at Avalon?
I doubt seriously if any one of us would be able to celebrate the holidays if we weren't feeling good to begin with.
So stay warm. Stay dry  And like the folks at Avalon...stay real!
Thank you Avalon.  Jerry Wagoner< /Review>< user_name>

<Text>I have a pretty complicated medical history and really appreciate having a pharmacy where they're willing to learn about me and my health needs. They listen to my story, and because they know the healthcare scene in the Morongo Basin, they make recommendations about sources of care that are worth listening to. Having a trustworthy pharmacy is as important to me as having a trustworthy primary care provider, and I came quickly to trust the staff at Avalon. Plus, they deliver--a huge convenience for me.< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>{'time': 1550552936384, 'text': 'Thank you, Khrysso, for your kind feedback.

I’ve used other pharmacies in the area, Avalon Pharmacy is by far the best. Avalon has been my pharmacy for over 18 years they have always taken care of my wellbeing. I have several medications I must take everyday. I have more than one physician for different health issues. Which over the years has led to possible drug interactions from one medication to another Avalon has always took care of it. I totally trust the pharmacist and the staff, they are friendly, caring, and very attentive to my personal needs. I’m not just a number as I was at other pharmacies, their prices are the best in the Morongo Basin. I will and have recommended Avalon Pharmacy to others for years, I am very happy to give Avalon a 5 star review.<//text>

This is the best pharmacy I have ever used. The people are very knowlegable and friendly. They always know your name and talk to you. Your not just a customr, your part of the family. I cant say enough about everyone that works there. If you use a different pharmacy you are missing out. They go out of thhere way to make sure you are getting what you need. I recommend them to everyone.< /Text>

<rate>5<//rate><Review>I've used Canology's services twice.  On both occasions our garbage cans  came out as clean as brand new.  The second time, I prepaid but then realized I would be out of town and unable to leave the cans out for their next scheduled neighborhood visit. I was concerned about being charged for a potential non-service.  I communicated with Canolgoy online and they postponed their service without any hassle or misunderstanding. I highly recommend the quality of their services and reliability.<//Review>< pics>

They cleaned my garbage cans and did a good job. Drawback is if u use them once, and don't need them for a couple month's and don't buy one of their plans, it is pricy to do it again!!</review>

I decided to try it out for myself as my cans needed a good cleaning. I paid online and input my information. When the day came, the estimated time of arrival for my service kept getting postponed. It wasn't until after 6pm that the driver finally arrived and serviced the cans. Overall, the cans look very good and clean inside. Maybe the driver wasn't having the best day, or was just having one of those moments. I came home from errands in the middle of him servicing the cans, waved to him, both of us made eye contact and he just ignored me. After he placed the Canology tags on my bins, he jumped in his truck and took off like a criminal that just stole something out of a car. Other than that experience,  I am satisfied with the experience.<//Text><pics>None</pics><username>Noel Sokukawa</username>< gmapID>

<text>When we moved into our new home we inherited some pretty disgusting garbage cans. They were so dirty, smelly and difficult to clean, we were going to have them replaced. We happened to see a Canology truck in action on a neighborhood walk and decided to try it out. Canology is AMAZING. Our three cans (garbage, compost, and recycling) are now sparkling clean! Highly recommend using this service!< /text><pictures>None</pictures><response>None<//response><gmap_id>0x808f8fa4af4730d7:0x6909c015ead72e3e< /gmap_id></record>

They're great. All of my waste collecting bin were spotless! I got half off of my first clean and they have a range of options on how often. If I knew how good they were I'd use my half off on a reoccurring cleaning. I will be using them again. If you use this service use your half off on a better option than single service.<//Review>

Jason from Canology did a pretty good job on cleaning all the three trash cans. He arrived on time and cleaned the cans and left them right at the curbside in an organized manner. The cans were super clean and were disinfected. I recommend on using Canology for your trash can cleaning purposes.<//review>

<Review>I had Canology out to clean my waste receptacles. They did a great job based on 15 years of use without ever cleaning them. There was some residue inside my garbage can, but like I said it was 15 years without ever rinsing it out so I was pleased. They smelled great too.</Review>< pics>

<text>After 14 years, it was time to have our yard carts professionally cleaned.   The inside of our green cart started to look like a science experiment.  Our daughter used Canology;  so we decided to give them a try.   I’m glad we did.  Making the appointment was easy, and they keep you updated about everything.   And as a new customer, we got 50% off the regular price.  We paid $35 for 3 carts.  The carts look like new.  No more gunk stuck to the bottom of the carts.  We’re really happy with their cleaning process.<//text><userid>103401520942197654870<//userid>< rating>

Canology rocks! How often have I wished for sparkling clean garbage/recycling/compost bins, and then quickly realized that will never happen (because I'm not going to do it)? Canology made that wish come true so easily, affordably, and quickly. I can't believe no one thought of this amazing service until now.</Text>

Awesome concept! Yes, like others I thought that "I can just spray out my cans with a hose".  NO way, what do you do with the nasty stuff at the bottom of the cans in the water???  Pour it down the gutter??  The environment and your neighbors will hate that!!  Canology solves all that, and magically your cans are completely clean, the waste water goes away with them and your cans smell cleaner than the ones inside your house!  Everyone should use this service.< /Text>

<text>Cleaning trash cans use never fun/easy.  So finding a service which does it for you was a surprise! We booked an appointment and were given a service date based on our trash pickup schedule. Closer to the service date, we received an email with an updated date, given it was the Thanksgiving weekend! On the day of service, we received an email early morning that the cans are already clean! We checked them out and from inside they were cleaner than we first received them!! They were smelling good as well, which is not something you would associate with trash cans!! 😀 Would definitely recommend this service to anyone who is still on the fence!!</text><resp>None</resp><Time>1607315351903< /Time>< rate>

Pretty cool idea.  Trash cans looked almost new after going through the cleaning.  Most importantly, they didn't stink.  I opted for a 1 time cleaning and will do it again when I need to clean my cans again.< /text>

It is very easy and convenient. We left the bins on the curbside for them to service. We received an email in the morning before and after the job was completed.<//text>

Very great cleaning service. Cans were very gross before and now look brand new. On-time and they spent time on each can to make sure they were perfect and even dried them. Will use again!<//text>

Wow! Our cans look new inside! Thank you. The green bin was awful this summer and I cleaned it myself as usual, but I don't have your tech and your ability to do a great job. Telling my neighbors about you...thanks again.< /review>

Decided to try this company after seeing an ad on social media. We have 3 kids, 2 dogs and a chinchilla-so our garbage cans acquire lots of smells. Canology was easy to schedule. They came the following week, first thing in the morning. I came home to 3 “brand new” looking and smelling bins! Plan to use them regularly!</review>

Our cans had become very smelly, sticky, and disgusting after 5 years of owning our home. We booked Canology service, and they arrived the next week, the day after our weekly garbage collection.  Service was performed quickly and thoroughly, and our cans were sparkly clean and smelled fresh after service.

The only downside is there is not an option to have a driver contact you on arrival or shortly before to bring out your cans - they must be left along the street. This was unfortunate for us as our cleaning didn't occur until early afternoon, and I had to go out several times in the morning to remove decidedly not-bagged debris passersby deposited into our cans while they were curbside, which Canology informs you will disqualify you for service and subject you to a fee.

Overall, it was a great service, and something we'll likely do annually to keep our cans cleaner and avoid build-up inside them.<//Review>

<pics>None< /pics><text>My trash bins were filthy, so I decided to give them a try. It was so easy to book online with Canology! They send a reminder email ahead of time to remind you to keep your bins out. Then, day of, there’s even a link to track to see where they are! So, you can get a pretty good idea of when they’ll be cleaning your cans. Afterwards, they put a little tag on them to let you know they’ve been cleaned, but really, I could already tell by looking at them! And they smelled nice, too! I’m likely going to sign up for their subscription service.< /text>< user_name>

{'time': 1597675293436, 'text': "Chris,\nThe Buy One, Get One Free offer allows folks to try out Canology for the first time at a significantly discounted price. As you mentioned, you had previously tried the service at a discounted price.  I can appreciate that you were upset that you couldn't have Canolgy return to your home and clean and sanitize your cans again for $15.  Canology can not provide multiple cleanings at a financial loss. We would be unable to pay our dedicated employees a living wage or remain in business for our loyal customers.\nThe offer clearly stated that it was for first-time customers. We did respond via email and offered you a 10% discount on any of our service options. We try hard to provide excellent service at an affordable price. If you took a moment and reevaluated your one-star review, I think you would agree that it is not reflective of the service you received.\nPlease let us know if we can be of help in the future."}<//Resp>

<rate>1<//rate><Review>I received a BOGO promo offer through email. It was pay $15 for one can and get a second can cleaned for free. I signed up and paid for the service. Two days later the owner emailed me and said that offer was not meant to be sent to me and it was sent by error. It was only supposed to be for new customers and not old customers such as myself. I last had my cans cleaned from them in 2018. I understand an error may have been made but just as if you saw an item in a store priced wrong they would legally have to sell it to me at that price. In today's world businesses live and die by their customer service. It would have been very easy for him to honor the offer but instead and decided to refund me my money.  While the cleaning service on the cans is good the customer service is bad. He could have gotten 3-4 more customers off of my recommendation but instead he chose to lose a customer. The right thing to do would be to honor the offer that was sent and I paid for even if it was sent by error.</Review></record></dataset><record>

Tried this service out using a promotion. The process scheduling was easy and they were able to come the next week. They came within their time frame and did a great job cleaning out our cans. Our main concern was our green waste as ours gets dirty with pets, but it looked 100x better than before. Wasn’t something we would do/pay for monthly, but will definitely use again for a deep clean.<//Text>

Best of the services I have had. Right from booking till cleaning Jason did a great job keeping me informed. Each step of the way I received notifications via sms and email. The three Bins Jason sanitized for me are as good as new and even after days it has retained its fresh scent. I have registered for their quarterly service. Worth more than the competitive price this company offers. Thank You Jason!<//Review>

I had read so many great reviews on Livermore Rants a Raves a FB group I am a member of. Canology always had Raves. I was not disappointed, all the raves about how professional and friendly are true. Not to mention the amazing job they did. We 100% recycle our food waste, so our green waste bin was horrific! Now I don't have to hold my breath when I open it up. I took advantage of one of their promos, just to give them a try, and I will definitely be using them again!</review>

This service is awesome! It sounded a bit ridiculous and unnecessary to me at first, but my wife wanted to do it and I couldn't be happier now that it's done.

Given the affordability and ease of scheduling for either once a month or once a quarter sealed it for me!</text>

First time was a shiny charm:  As if the bins first went through a car wash and then a modern dishwasher.  The garbage, compost, and recycling bins are like new again.< /text>

Washing trash cans might seem weird, but if you have a cat, you know how your cans may wind up smelling not so fresh.< /review><user>100321001026706376778< /user><gmap_id>0x808f8fa4af4730d7:0x6909c015ead72e3e</gmap_id>< Rating>

Excellent service at a great price!  My cans were NASTY to the point where they were attracting flies and  stinking up my yard.  After Canology cleaned them they look spotless, the smell is gone, and my fly problem seems to have disappeared.  I highly recommend Canology's service and will definitely be using them again!</Review>

Canology is so worth it- not having to bend way down into the compost/greenwaste bin to clean it out, no more nasty water splashing back at me as I try to hose it down... We love using this service- they show up on trash collection day, clean the bins, put them back. It’s so seamless, and I’m thrilled to no longer deal with disgusting bins.< /review>

I live in Oakland where the sun bakes on my trash cans all summer long and my compost bin smells like death. After almost vomiting when opening the lid I looked into the best way to deal with this situation. I discovered Canology and am an instant fan. They showed up and pressured washed all the nastiness out and everything looks brand new!!! Can't recommend enough.< /Text>

<time>1565721950708<//time><review>Full disclosure: we received a coupon in the mail and are receiving a complimentary cleaning just for writing a review (good or bad); with that said, we plan on signing up for a regular cleaning at full price, we just have to decide how often.

Where has this service been? We were putting off cleaning our cans because we couldn’t figure out how to do it without making it a massive project and who wants to that on the weekend? We didn’t want to deal with the hassle, so we kept putting it off while the gunk in and around our can accumulated, making us hesitant to touch them to even take them out on trash day.

When I saw a flyer for this service in the mail, I didn’t even hesitate, and we are so thrilled with their cleaning, we don’t want even want to use the cans, they are sparkling!

Like I said, we are absolutely signing up for a regular cleaning, we just have to decide how often we need it.< /review>< name>

I got a postcard about their service and tried it out today. It's awesome. I just pulled the gross bins outside in the morning, and voila, it comes back  very clean. I have the grossest bin to compare (before and after). I will definitely use their service again!< /text>

We had a great experience with Canology. They responded immediately to my request for service, and my garbage cans were sparkling afterwards. I no longer have to wear a hazmat suit to take out the trash! This is a service I never knew I needed but will likely use again.< /Review>

Canology did a wonderful job -I have had the same garbage cans for over 20 years and had never been cleaned - the post-it on the can after a garbage pick up was informative.  I contacted them and the process was simple, complete and accurate.  I would recommend them to anyone and will definitely use them again.</review>

Absolutely loved the service. It was a first time schedule. We could leave the cans in the street per the HOA so left them by the garage easily accessible. Heard the truck pull up and decided to watch from the house! Loved how fast it was and how little water was seen dumping on the street. Pretty much only the rinse of the exterior. The bins looked amazing afterwards and had the cleanest smell for being trash bins. 2 weeks later the bins still look and feel clean as if the new grime has nothing to adhere to. I plan on using them every few months for now but will be repeat customer forever<//Text>

Garbage can become so gross over time, especially if you don't start service with new ones. The service was easy --just leave the cans on the curb after pickup day -- and the cans are better than when we moved in.<//review>

Very satisfied with the service, scheduling was very simple on their website and got regular updates on the date of service. Cans were thoroughly cleaned and sanitized and they carry all the equipment in the truck for cleaning. Will repeat for sure.</review>

Canology is like having a personal maid for your garbage can.  For years, I realized I should clean my garbage cans, but yet it never happened.  Since Canology came to town, my garbage and recycling cans look and smell like new and my green bin is no longer a neighborhood embarrassment.  The Canology crew is professional, affordable and I appreciate the text reminders.  Thanks Canology!< /text>

Folks at Canology were very friendly and responsive. Our 4-unit building had a set of quite stinky bins that hadn't been cleaned in many years and Canology worked their magic, thanks to their equipment and skill. Now, I can lift the lids without grimacing and nose-plugging. We plan on setting up routine cleanings for our bins because it makes a welcomed difference, and they can do the cleaning more efficiently than we can.<//Text>

Our bins were pretty nasty, especially the compost bin.  We were planning to douse them in bleach and spray them out when I found Canology.  For a very nominal fee, all 3 of our bins were cleaned.  They look like brand new bins...they are immaculate and there is no odor!  We'll definitely continue to use this service.  We aren't sure how often we will need it, but plan on monthly through the warmest months.  We highly recommend!< /Review>

We just had our trash cans cleaned by Canology and are very happy with the service they provided. Communication was great and the service exceeded our expectations. With dog waste and food waste build up, the summer heat had our cans smelling so bad that spraying it ourselves was not an option. Canology cleaned it thoroughly, it smelled & looked great and they left no mess behind when they were done. I highly recommend their service!< /Text>

I took advantage of a one-time cleaning of 2 garbage cans for $25.00.  It was worth every penny, and I am thinking of signing up for one of their recurring plans. The two cans hadn't been cleaned for years...but when Canology was done they sparkled inside and even smelled good! I highly recommend this service.< /text>

I was very happy with getting our compost and recycling cans cleaned by Canology! It appreciated that it was the morning after trash pick up and we simply left the trash cans by the curb. It was also nice to receive an email reminder prior to the cleaning. They are nice and clean after this service and I will likely use this company again! What a great idea to have this service, especially for the compost bin, which can get really bad.<//text>

We learned about Canology from one of our neighbors a couple of months ago, and decided to give it a shot. (I never knew that a garbage can cleaning business even existed)! We left our garbage cans out on our trash pick-up day, and the mobile Canology truck came by and thoroughly washed our 3 garbage cans! It left the cans spotless and clean!< /review>

Everyone needs this service! It is quick, eco-friendly, inexpensive and leaves no trace. Our cans are spotless and our gnat problem is solved.

We LOVE the service Canology provides!  They come exactly when scheduled and leave the cans looking (and smelling!) like new.  And we have REALLY gross cans.  We have dog waste, cat litter waste, kitchen compost, diapers plus all the regular stuff.  Our cans get so smelly.  Canology comes and in 15 minutes the cans are fresh and clean.  Totally worth the cost to me!  And bonus points: my kids love watching the whole process!</Review>

Canology keeps your cans clean and funk free!  :-)  I was wondering how well this would work, and a month after our cans were cleaned by Canology, two of the three are still pretty clean!  We took advantage of their special because we've never had our trash cans cleaned, and have been very happy with their service.  The main garbage can and recycle cans are still clean on the inside and don't smell very bad.  Again, even after a month.  Our yard waste/compost can continued to smell decent after a couple weeks, and now that a month has passed, it is starting to get the smell of old food and such.  I expected that to happen because we put yard waste as well as food scraps into it.  Because of this, I strongly suggest getting the compost/yard waste can cleaned frequently to prevent the smell and associated flies and such from finding your can.  I will certainly be calling Canology back!<//Review>

< review>
For the most part I usually clean my garbage cans as in the summer the they can get pretty smelly.  So when I saw the post it note on my door for garbage can cleaning I thought I would give it a try and see if they could do better than what I do.   They showed up on the day they promised and I watched them cleaning the cans.  It's like a big dishwasher!  They came out very clean and were done in about 15 minutes.  At the time they only had weekly and monthly plans and I told them I would be interested in something that would be done on a quarterly basis.  They mentioned that they were were coming out with that.  So when they do, I'm signing up!  Definitely a job I don't mind letting someone else do.  I would definitely recommend giving them a try and seeing if it's something that works for you.<//review>

<Review>After finding maggots in my organics can, I was so grossed out, but hated the thought of having to clean my trash cans. I’ve cleaned them in the past, and it’s not easy- what do you do with all that gunk stuck to the bottom of the can? When I read a Nextdoor review about Canology, I knew that was going to solve my stinky problem!
I signed up for a one-time cleaning of all three cans. They are only in each area of your City monthly, so I had to wait a few weeks until they came, but it was fine. A self-contained truck arrived on my scheduled day and within about 20 minutes all three cans were steam cleaned and deodorized. They took the gunk with them and went on to the next smelly-can customer! What a great service! Thanks Canology!</Review>< Rating>

We recently had a spill in one of our garbage cans that created a nasty smell.  Luckily we found Canology! Their website is easy to use, and we got scheduled the following week to get our cans cleaned.  Their communication is super clear.  They came on time and cleaned all of our cans as expected.  We definitely recommend Canology and we are considering their subscription service because we want to keep our cans sparkling clean!< /text>

<text>Excellent service both times I have visited. Quick service. This last time for a set of tires they gave me a more expensive set for the same price as quoted because my car required a different tire than it had on it when i brought it in.< /text>< Pictures>

Went in and typically have great service. Wanted to put 4 new tires on some wheels I bought (brand new in box). When I got home I noticed 3 of the wheels had scratches on them. Went back and talked to them about it and the worker said that it was “manufacture issue”.  They need to either replace my wheels or give me my money back.</review>

Ca not beat the prices. I have a 2007 Mercedes the first time I put tires on this car they were $250 per tire at America's Tire Company. (1000.00$) Then I had to replace two of them for $500 at Les Schwab. So this time I even called Costco they wanted $480 for two tires. Tire experts got me exactly what I wanted for $223 out the door so if prices are a concerne for you like it is for me check these guys out!</Text>

< Review>
Terrible shop, they didn’t balance my wheels which caused terrible shaking on the highway and is a safety hazard. When I called to ask if they had balanced the wheels, the employee LIED and said yes of course we balanced them! Not believing them I too it in to Costco and they concluded the car was not safe, and needed to have its wheels balanced. Paid Costco to do it and the car rode just fine. Do not come here! Not worth it to save a bit of cash but get your work done by liars and cheats.<//Review>

<review>Every time I come here is a great experience. They are friendly and always give the lowest price possible. One time I forgot my wheel key for my VW Passat, and they waited for me even though they were supposed to close. I reccomend this place because they are hard working people that dont mess around. So what if there's no fancy lobby like America's tire. I have saved over one hundred dollars in tires! bring your buisness here you will be happy with more money in your pocket.< /review></record>

Nearly half the cost of Les Schwab to mount and balance 2 tires that were off the car. Also, 1/8 the wait time. Superior in every way that matters.< /Review>

I must say... THEY RESCUED my car from a flat tire problem without an appointment! I literally had no hope to stop by anywhere to get my tire fixed so quickly for such a good price! Quality service which made the situation seem like a short bad dream which resulted in a working car on the road! Big thank you to the team there and  I would refer them to all who are having a flat or even need tires replaced!< /Text>

They are the best and you would be a fool not to go there for all your tire and break needs  A************</text>< pictures>

I told him torque the wheels to spec (about 85 ft lb), they proceeded to take the impact gun and tighten the lugs right in front of me. The previous time they did this they over tightened the lugs on one wheel and complained to me on this trip they couldn't get it off even though they were the last to touch it. You're better off at the Big O down the street.</text>< pics>

I have purchased several sets of tires from this store, mainly because they have the best prices.  Recently one of the tires separated, at about 50% of its service life, causing thousands of dollars damage to my vehicle.   We had taken the vehicle in two weeks before to have rotation and balance, but they did not balance the tires on the rear.  Their negligence caused our vehicle to break down placing my family at great risk. They refused to cover any damage to the vehicle, though they did warranty the tire.  I will not be returning to this store, mainly because I no longer feel that I can trust their service or product.</text>

Their prices are the best in the area, and they are usually fast. Service could be a little friendlier, but for how quick and affordable it is, they'd have to be pretty rude to lose my business!</text>

<text>I am a very loyal customer and have used this place for years as well as sent them several friends and family members. I bought a full set of tires and after installation immediately noticed my car pulling to the left and shaking. Brought the car back, they "fixed" it and as soon as I left again I immediately realized nothing had changed. I brought the car to another shop to have an alignment done, this shop refused to do one because my tires have "flat spots all over them." I brought the car back to Tire Experts and was told I can pay an additional 350$ for a set of new tires but there's nothing else they could do. Also, they are "out" of my used tire size. Just bad business and will do anything to make an extra dollar off you. Typical for these types of places, I deserve one star because I should have known better.</text>< pictures>

(Translated by Google) Very good although they take care and they give good attention the truth I recommend it to places that want to get more money. This place does not what they say is what they charge without increases and without excuses.

(Original)
Muy buenos aunque tarden arreglan y dan buena atención la verdad lo recomiendo ay lugares que quieren sacar más dinero . Este lugar no lo que dicen es lo que cobran sin aumentos y sin excusas.<//review>

Very nice gentlemen helped me but his suggestion didn't quite meet my needs. Not a super big affordable selection. I was shown a few options in the $550 range for just the Fujifilm camera with no add ons.

I ended up spending $575 elsewhere and got the Canon Rebel T7 camera, the bag, two lenses, two 32gb memory cards, three filters, a tripod and a few other items. I wanted to shop with a local business but it proved not to be the best option, not even close. I asked if there were options that came with some add-ons and was told no.

Three stars only because of their service and not their selection of items.<//review>

The guys over at Fireside Camera were so helpful in finding me a lens which was hard to come by. I called them and put down my name a month ago. They called me back today and put a hold on the lens I wanted once I told them I was still interested. Very pleasant and helpful people</text>

<text>Old fashioned in a good way.  Prices are comparable to Amazon and other good online places, so it comes down to service. They know what they're selling. Gave great advice for binoculars' price v performance trade-offs. Small but good selection of quality used equipment.<//text>< pictures>

The two machines at the back of this little camera shop that are self-service photo print kiosks are the main reason I come here, as there are few if any remaining places to go in SF where you can print yourself.  The problem for me was the attitude of the owner/manager (?) when I mentioned the over-cropping and over-yellow:  I was greeted with a lecture on how photographers KNOW to take a picture with a slightly larger frame than what they want because of automatic cropping.  I think they should FIX the machines - since most people are not expecting their pictures to come overly yellow and pictures over-trimmed.  Then, if they are nice to me, I will come back for my next camera purchase and tell a friend...< /review>

<Text>It was 2013 January 3, I was carrying my crappy cheap tripod on the way to golden bridge for a night shot. While I was waiting the bus, the tripod breaks completely. It was getting dark, I was about to miss the perfect timing for night shot. I searched this store from my iphone. The stuffs was very helpful, they recommended me the exact tripod I need. And at end, I took some nice night picture of the golden bridge.</Text>< Date>

<review>helped this traveler out!  i am on a road-trip and left my sensor cleaning kit at home.  there was a spec on my sensor, and like a dummy i tried to blow it off, then touched it ever so lightly with a clean cloth...but of  couse it smudged.  i went to mikes camera in mill valley because that's where my hotel is.  they didn't have the right kit, but said they could clean it by the afternoon.  i only had one day in san francisco.  not only did fireside have the kit, they showed me the proper way to clean the sensor, AND cleaned it for me on the spot.  they were friendly, knowledgeable, and didnt treat me like the rookie i am.<//review>< pictures>

Kashish salon is just opposite to Mandir. Nice and clean salon with quick services. All the staff members are cheerful and greet you with a big smile. Quite reasonable as well : 8 for eyebrows and $6 Upper lips.

At times parking can be a little
Problem as most of the spots are reserved by other stores.<//review>

<review>Very excellent service here at Kashish Salon. The salon is clean and spacious. I have been here twice and both times have been gentle and thorough with threading. I will only come here for my threading now. Looking forward to doing a facial and deep conditioning here as well. This is your one stop shop for your beauty services. Thank you!!</review>< Pics>

<text>I personally liked this branch better than the ones in Sunnyvale and Santa Clara. Kasish was one of the few salons open before 11am on a Monday morning. I was the first customer and she did a really great job on threading! Reasonable cost for a very good service.

<review>I was here for my eyebrows. I didn't find the staff very professional- as they were taking in other clients while working on me.

This is my go to salon for threading and waxing. Service is really good and they have the best prices. I always get my eyebrows shaped from Anjali who is great at her job, professional and really sweet in dealing with clients. I highly recommend Kashish Salon for beauty services.</text>

Service is awesome during weekdays. But on weekends,  the workers are overworked because of so many walk ins. I took an appointment well before time, so that I get served right. But the staff was tired and doing everything halfheartedly.

The owner "Kashish" needs to take care of this and not overwork her staff.
Been a regular customer for months, but now rethinking this salon.</review>

So firstly the lady ruined my eyebrows and kept saying its looking good on you, when i was constantly telling her i don't want this thin eyebrows and then talking non stop without even getting what i want then starting misbehaving and when I literally wanted to run away from there i asked her how much i need to pay she said some xyz amount less then $12 i paid through card and then i see i was charged $15. And now she says if its less than 20 u will have to pay extra $3. Wow, they are suppose tell us that before not after charging. And the attitude they were throwing was more like as if we are getting something from them for free and not paying for the service. I was there regular customer but the previous lady was amazing and these new ladies over there doesn't even know that if customer is saying something they should at least listen and not start arguing plus who does charge $3 for anything less than 20$. That is insanely. Would not recommend this place at all.<//Text>

< Review>
The woman was rude. Although I been to this store many times, my 2 regular ladies were not there and I had never seen the 2 there. She wore dark colored glasses and she was "maybe in her 20's" She had no people skills. I feel like I bothered her by walking in at 6:15 pm on a Friday evening. She took exactly 3 mins to do each eyebrow. In my opinion, she missed some. I asked her if she can clean it up a little more here and there. She said "no, those are ingrown??" I told her I dont like my eyebrows to look like this...she said "oh well u need to pay" and she walked to register.
I go to this salon atleast once a month. Her attitude was so rude.
The window said 7 dollars which is what I pay all the time plus my 2 dollar tip. This girl charged me 8 dollars and said " new charge" and pointed to paper on wall with small writing!
I should have been told that before hand.
I usually love the ladies at this salon, but because of this unsolicited rudeness, I'm not sure what to do. I don't want to go back and deal with this person ever again...she needs more training. I miss the other 2 ladies who always do a wonderful job on my eyebrows.<//Review>

<Text>Went there despite reading the reviews. The lady sounded rude. They were attending to another person when I reached. After about 10 minutes’ wait I was called for the service I booked. The women were all along making fun of the other customer whom they attended to. It was surely not in good taste. I was able to strike a conversation with them and then they were infact very nice. They seem to have had a busy day until then. My experience with waxing was good. 2 of them did together and I was out within 20 minutes</Text>< Pictures>

Great place. I would definitely recommend their services for waxing, threading and facial. I am new in town, and having found them was the best thing ever. Reading all the other reviews was helpful, as the reviews were exactly very true.. They are extremely fast and provide a friendly staff. Great client service. I would definitely go here again.<//review>

Even if there is nobody in the salon they don't provide service and ask to come some other day.
I am not sure how they are doing business. I hope their owner is aware of it.

I agree with one of the reviews below . They talk amongst themselves and make you feel uncomfortable.

I would not recommend this place.</Text>

I go here regularly for waxing and Threading.
What I like about the place is,
Waxing - Very fast service. They do the job very fast and clean.
Threading - Good job again. The price $5 for threading is unbeatable.
Facial - I do this occasionally here. I felt they were good with it too. Relaxing. There is room for improvement.
Overall, for a busy mom, it is the best place to go and get your stuff done quickly. In and Out in considerably less time.The fastest and clean service I have seen so far.< /Review>

<Text>Came here to get my eyebrows and upper lip done and the service was horrible. The person who did my eyebrows just did a pathetic job. She kept talking to other employees and didn’t pay attention to the work she was doing. When I checked she had missed to thread some portion and when I told her she got offended.
They are unprofessional and rude. I would never come here. Very very unprofessional. I would never recommend this place. Their service is horrible.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

This salon is only good for threading. Haircut is not at all worth the money. I think great clips or super cuts provide better haircut services than these guys. Very pissed off</Review>

< Review>
The new staff after this place got bought over by Kashish is friendly, talkative and do a good job. I am always greeted with a smile and they make sure that i am happy with wax/eye brows, whatever you get done. They actually make a personal connection with the client instead of complaining about the client with each other in Punjabi 😠.  The old owners used to do that. So annoying since i understand punjabi just fine even though i am not punjabi myself.< /Review>

<Text>Went by reviews. Writing this so that it helps someone out there. Went there for waxing and threading.. there were 3 Punjabi ladies not interested at all in providing the service and fighting amongst themselves as to who needs to attend to me. The whole whole I was there they were talking something in loud voices and laughing. Felt really uncomfortable and service was worst. They did not even ask me to check post waxing and just went ahead and wiped my hands( even wiping they did not do it right, my hands felt sticky from wax). Immediately I mentioned I needed no other service even though I needed threading and left the place. I am not sure how this place has 4.5 stars. Run for your lives and peace of mind!<//Text>< user_id>

<Review>Awesome service.
I got a gold facial and eyebrow threading.
The work is pretty good.
People are kind.
Facial took 1hour. They gave Very good massage for about 30 minutes. It was relaxing.
I didn't know that a coupon is available in groupon for this place. So I paid full money. Next time i would go with a coupon. :)</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

Recently I got my facial and waxing done from Harvinder and as always it was a very good experience. She is very sincere in her work and makes sure that I dont feel uncomfortable or in pain while getting services done from her. She has been my go to person since past 2 years. Thank you Harvinder and I will keep visiting you always for all of my servies!<//Text>

< Review>
Worst experience ever.First  time went there,told them I,m a new customer over here.Owner send one lady called Jyoti.She threaded my eyebrow very badly,cut 4-5 places.After coming home I noticed that .Then I told her to cut my hair in layer cut,showed her one madel photo also.She pretended that she knew how to cut my hair.every 20 sec she went another room may be asking someone how to do.She did a total mess to my hair.she cut my front bang very short.After I noticed she even don't want to agree with me,she wants to prove I am wrong ,it is a right cutting of hair.Then I called the owner ,other beautician.Then they agreed with me,the owner lady said sorry to me,the other beautician tried to correct my hair but she also admitted that it is a total mess,its not possible to correct.I will never ever go there again.Even I could cut my hair better than this.Nothing can worst than this.< /Review>

<review>I’m regular customer for Sunnyvale kashish salon, but I really liked the way Milpitas guys did the waxing(painless and very smooth👍👍). I booked my appointment around 5pm, but I went there around 6pm, they didn’t say anything but right immediately they did my waxing and threading. It was really quick and painless. Neelam, harwinder and Anjali are really friendly and I really liked the service they provided for me. Next time I will go to this salon.</review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

< review>
My experience at Kashish was just great. I got a facial which was done by Neelam and she was absolutely amazing. The top up was the shoulder massage that she gave it was just a few mins but was so relieving. Also, Harwinder did my eyebrows. I am never satisfied with how my eyebrows are and nobody brings that perfect arch on them, ever. But Harwinder did it; I love my eyebrows. Thank you guys!< /review>

< review>
I was the first appointment of the day . Started with eyebrows with Bholi and she kept my eyebrows thick as asked. Followed by waxing with harwinder and neelam they were super quick and my waxing was finished in 25mins . All in all quick and good service . Better to take an appointment so you don't have to wait as they are usually very busy .< /review>

Very bad customer service and they have messed up my eye brows. I thought probably its one off mistake and then they did the same to my friend as well. I had been the customer for Henna threading for 3 years and this new management and workers suck<//review>

<rate>1</rate><Review>Lady who threaded my eyebrows was rude. She got upset with me when I placed my hands in the wrong position to hold my brows. She aggressively fixated my hands in the position she wanted them. After she finished my brows, I went to go pay and she started snacking on something with her hands. Didn't see her wash her hands before eating so I'm not sure if she was eating before my threading and didn't wash her hands then either. She also charged me $10 when the sign outside said $5.</Review>< pictures>

< review>
My Grandsons & Son were here mastering some music & networking. While I didn't go inside, I can recount the AWESOME experience they ALL had working with producer Diamond Eye...🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
My Grandson said, "There won't be anyone else that will ever be able to do any of my project's mastering ever again, except Diamond Eye!" And the song sounded Extraordinarily AMAZING! 💯💯 BEST STUDIO EVER!<//review>

If you're looking for a professional studio with great rates, professional equipment, and a great atmosphere, look no further then Red Room Studios. I had my first session last week and it was a very cool experience. Mr. Scott was very professional and attentive to my music and the goals I am trying to achieve. I recommend Red Room Studio without hesitation. E-Stone</Review>

Look no further and choose Red Room Studios! I felt confident working with Scott for the first time because of the manner i was welcomed. He made sure i got exactly what i asked for. My experience working with Red Room Studio is A1 because i was able to get suggestions to perfect my craft. Red Room Studios is quintessential environment to professionally record,produce, edit, mix and master your music!!!!< /Text>

<Text>What a great experience, I reach out to Scott (Owner) about a month or two ago inquiring about a studio session. He was very helpful, answered all of my questions and I tend to have a lot of questions. After a month went by he reached out to me letting me know what he had available. We booked a date and was set. He also set us up with one of his producers. Everyones vibes were dope. We are pretty new to LA and it is hard to find humble, wholehearted people. & Scott and Tree were definitely one of them. Both very talented, even made suggestions about certain things as we recorded. Prices are great, & the job gets done. We really appreciate you all so dearly. My little sister flew all the way from Arkansas to record in RED ROOM STUDIOS! Definitely worth the trip for her! Highly recommended! Thank you Scott & Tree!< /Text>< pics>

Red Room Studios is in my opinion one the best studios in Los Angeles, it has great quality, from what I've heard from Rucci the engineers are very helpful. Great environment for artists to get their work done, cozy area for your section to come in and encourage and listen to your music while you do your thing. This is the go-to studio for sure!< /review>

<text>Disatified with the way they treated me as a artist I didn't feel like I was treated equal people are talking in the background in my song(s) noise gate didn't really help that's how loud the noise was! I felt like I wasn't walking into a studio I walked into a heckling party. If you a artist that doesn't normally go to this studio DO NOT GO THERE! THEY WILL NOT TAKE YOUR CRAFT SERIOUS! this is California lots of studios out here that will take you serious so don't waste your money going to red room studio. - GRIZZO_901< /text>< pictures>

<review>The owner of the studio has accomodated our needs.  The band has had 2 gigs inside of a month with schedules that conflict and we've been able to get into red room studios with ease to fit all our schedules.  Highly recommend this place and thanks again to the studio officials.   You're awesome!</review>< pics>

Honestly was a bit scared to go inside as this was my first time going to a studio, but that went away when I met Scott. Very chill and laid back dude who know's what he's doing. He's really helped improve my song. Really had a great experience and I am planing to keep going here.< /Text>

Happy to have come as a client now I work as a engineer here. The owner runs the studio very proficiently and professionally so if you ever need a quality radio ready mix ask for TEJOHN!< /text>

Scott is going to have one of the hottest studios in the city, if not the hottest, that isn't ran by a major Corp. All about business, which is what it's all about. This studio could be in the gutter and he could flip it into something crazy.</Text>

Dope setting,learned a few new things while recording there too, CJ was spot on with pasteing the hook in different parts of the track, did it in one try without me having to rerecord it, never worked with a engineer that didn't have to do it more than once. Definitely will be back ASAP<//Text>

<Text>I was recording one of my covers of beyonce songs, im Looking fowards to the next section.

Everyone was welcoming,and makes you feel comfortable to record
I'll refer everyone in los angeles area that need a great environment to record,to contact there.

The studio is clean,the people are warm hearted,and the way they make your music sound is just a magic trick.

I love love love it.<//Text>< resp>

< Review>
Got a flat next door at Kaiser and hobbled over to wheel works. They had 4 tires in my cars size (70000 mile firestones) in stock and had me in and out of there in an hour just before closing. Super friendly, fast, efficient, with reasonable prices.</Review>

<review>Steve helped me out with my tires for the 2nd time and gotta say it's all you can ask for when it comes to customer satisfaction. Professional, helpful and straight to the point. It's all I can ask for.

Wont repair broken GE stations, only one is operational, nice staff, clean restroom, but we prefer Les Schwab's work and free coverages. WE WOULD GO HERE, over Costco, they use cheap Michelon tires.
Thanks WW for good service & staffers.</review>

<review>Great service, I had a flat this morning, Ziyad was a great help. He got in the tire the same day and got the job completed very efficiently. He was extremely professional and straight forward with the whole process, strongly recommend him. It was my first time there and I was truly impressed.

I just wanted to Thank the employees there at Wheel Works for their hospitality and service. Tom was a blessing to us on a early Saturday morning, we were frantically looking for a place to service our flat tire so we could return to our home in the Central Valley. Tom welcomed us in 30 minutes before opening time and had us on our way shortly. You were truly a Godsend to this Damsel in distress! May God Bless you and your company over and abundantly!

They have a huge selection of tires, but you need to call them of visit them to find out what's available as the web site only shows a small fraction of their availability.  Or you can order on Tirerack and ship them to this location.

Get the lifetime alignment for your car.  Worth every cent.<//review>

< Review>
Ziyad was great. I had an appointment and they took me in right away. While my car was there, they did what I expected and also did their normal courtesy check to make sure the minor maintenance had been taken care of. When my car was ready, I received a call to let me know and it was within the estimated time they gave me.  Even though I planned for a longer visit, they got me out fast.

No surprises, and very respectful of my time. These guys are great.< /Review>

Great service, ten times better than at my dealership! ALL the staff was friendly both at the shop and on the phone. For those of us who don't speak "car", they took the time to explain what was going on with my vehicle and I actually understood! I would highly recommend them! Thanks for solving the mystery noise Wheel Works!<//text>

I have been to this place 5 times. I had to go back every time to fix something they didn’t do properly the first time - until I just stopped going here. 1st visit - oil change - they over filled and my car started smoking on the highway as soon as I left. 2nd visit to fix this. 3rd visit was to change tires, they mixed up front and back tires so my onboard computer started reporting pressure of rear tires as front tires. 4th visit to switch tires. My 5th and last visit - coolant leak, they said they changed the coolant reservoir as it had a crack. My car heated up again in a week - I got tired and went to a bigger dealership -  they said I have a crack in the reservoir! This was 5th and last visit to this place. To be fair - their customer service seems ok but they just don’t know what they are doing.< /text>

<text>Tom and his team do exceptional work at Wheel Works. Even though I've moved away from Livermore, I still take the extra time to drive out to see them--great rates, friendly staff, excellent speed, and they make sure I"m happy and taken care of every time.

I like wheels work but didn't get service what I always get from other wheels work locations like Dublin and Hayward. I drive with uber so when I asked for uber discounts,  he said we don't give. But  all other locations wheel works never said like. Then I complained about that to wheel works. They took action really quickly . Next day manger call me 8 am to take my discount. But I didn't go and never go back this wheel works. I always be customer of wheel works but not this location.</Text>< Pics>

I have been going to Wheelworks for 20+ years, numerous locations, and have been a customer of this location since it has been here. This is the best Wheelworks  The crew is always helpful, and trust sending my family members down wo/fear they will be taken advantage of.< /Text>

<text>I was referred to this place by another wheelwork because my car was lowered. Was told they have alignment racks that are lowered car friendly. I live 21miles away and I thought I would give them a try. I came on 4/28/2018 around 12:30PM afternoon about 6 hours before they close and hope to drop off the car. Ziyad helped me, I told them I have lifetime alignment and would like to drop off the car. He told me he cannot take anymore alignment they are fully booked for the day. I asked is there an appointment I can make for next day and he said weekends are first come first serve, Appointment only available for weekdays.

I went back the next day 4/29/2018. Ziyad was the one that helped me again. I was the 2nd in line when they are open. I told him the same thing I need an alignment and he told me it would be about 2 1/2 hours wait. I questioned him how can it be possible because I am the 2nd in line and they just open. I told him isnt it first time first serve on the weekend? He replied only Saturday. He also said because they have cars left from the day before. I wasn't too happy, I said so basically you guys are backed up every day because whatever wasn't finish will just keep on roll over to the next day. He then said because people know how busy they are and drop off car during midnight to their key drop off box. He also said "I am sorry that I cannot do you free alignment today." I got so offended. I paid for my lifetime alignment. It is not free.

I would not recommend this place for anyone. I feel like they are pushing me away because I didn't purchase my service from them.< /text>< date>

Don't go there unless you want to be lied to! My car was down on the road and towed to Wheel Work. Base on my limited knowledge about the symptom, either the battery or the alternator was the problem. Wheel Work checked and replaced the broken battery but told me the alternator was ok.  Guess what? After I picked up my car and drove about 20 mins, new battery drained out and I WAS DOWN ON THE ROAD AGAIN!!! After towed to another auto shop and diagnosed the real cause was a broken alternator!!! Really really good luck if you trust their "professional skill"!!!< /text>

I stopped for fuel on my way to work. My truck did not start after refueling. I called AAA, then called wheel works to see if they had my batteries.(F350,7.3) Not only did they answer the phone an hour+ before they opened, Tom invited me to come in as soon as I could. I got there 45 minuts before they opened and Tom went right to work. The truck was ready to go before I was done with breakfast.  I got about five miles from Wheel Works and my Power Control Modual when off line.  I called Wheel Works and asked if they have had that happen before. They told me to being it back. I had the truck towed back and they went right to work on it.  They troubleshot the system and found a hidden fuse, bad. After they replaced it, the truck ran fine. We think the short was caused by a broken button on the end of the gear shitfer.  They didn't even charge me for the troubleshooting or the fuse. I will be back.< /text>

Made an appointment for 10am to get tires rotated and oil changed.  Dropped off van before 10 and was told it would take about 1 hour. At noon i noticed the tech was just now starting to drain the oil.   I won't be coming back.</text>

Food was delicious, great prices and big servings. Definitely see why it has such a high rating. Chicken fried steak was exceptional and the french toast was yummy. Loved the sausages too! Best I had in a long time.</text>

< Review>
It came here because of the very very high rating. Quality of breakfast item is more like a 4.2. Ambiance is a 4.0 but the customer service is where they shine at a five-star attentiveness. I'm guessing their lunch items is where they get their best marks</Review>

The food is decent, we visited our first time today which is a Holiday so I'm not sure if that affected the wait time. (About an hour) They were very busy . If there's a wait when you visit be prepared to wait outside. Parking is tough as the lot is small. However, Coffee and service were both very awesome!< /text>

My husband and I tried this place for the first time today. Wait was not long, all of the staff were friendly and the food was delicious! We are definitely adding this to our weekend breakfast rotation! My husband liked it so much, he bought a shirt!</Review>

All I can say is this place is awesome! The staff is friendly.. My son wanted to meet the owner personally the owner took the time to leave the grill to come meet him.. The establishment was very clean especially the bathroom's.. Food was great! This was my first visit will be returning... Blow Denny's out the water..😊<//Review>

The food was not very good. Corned beef hash had just a little shreds of corn beef. Food was not hot. Scrambled eggs overcooked possibly made ahead of time. Was disappointed. Did not even take the leftovers. Not coming back.  Sad to leave this review.</Text>

Our waiter recommended we try their housemade habanero hot sauce it was the BOMB!! They had a nice little tent out front for seating. Everything was super clean. We encountered many staff members and they were all very attentive and friendly!! This place is a MUST try!!<//text><resp>{'time': 1617304973109, 'text': 'Thank you soo much for the great review and support.'}< /resp>< name>

This place is a hidden gem, I was looking for a good place for breakfast and stumbled on this, had good reviews so said what the heck. We got seated right away, I already knew what I wanted since the menu was online and the raves about it were awesome. The wait staff were all very nice, they came by a lot to check in and see if you would like a refill. The tipping is they have flavor creamer French Vanilla no other and the coffee it good. Will definitely be back. Prices are reasonable as well.< /Text>

Excellent kind, friendly, clean and comforting service. Especially considering how they are forced to comply with County and Covid mandates. Our burgers and friends were so delicious, mouth watering and perfect portion. Definitely coming back<//review>

I’m a first timer and I have to say....THIS PLACE IS AMAZING!! Don’t miss out on the habanero salsa! If you scared of spice make sure to get it on the side and at least try it, you will not be disappointed. The service from beginning to end was nothing short of five stars! This will definitely be my new go to spot.<//text>

My second time here and everything I have ordered has been fresh, great tasting and came with great service. They are open for breakfast and lunch only, and they get busy, but well worth the 10-20 minutes wait .< /Review>

<Text>This place is a hidden gem, I was looking for a good place for breakfast and stumbled on this, had good reviews so said what the heck. We got seated right away, I already knew what I wanted since the menu was online and the raves about it were awesome. The wait staff were all very nice, they came by a lot to check in and see if you would like a refill. The tipping is they have flavor creamer French Vanilla no other and the coffee it good. Will definitely be back. Prices are reasonable as well.</Text><username>Mike Morales< /username></record>

Still serving curbside! Best burger I've had in a long time, buterry buns, plenty of cheese and patties cooked to perfection with the right amount of sauce and veggies to round it out. Service is top notch. You will feel good supporting this business.</Review>

I TRULY CAN NOT SAY ENOUGH ABOUT THIS PLACE, I HAVE DRIVEN BY SOOOOOO MANY TIMES SAYING

"IM GOING IN ONE DAY."

OK I WASTED A LOT OF TIME NOT DOING SO AND MISSING A DARN GOOD MEAL, good atmosphere, Hometown feel, ( which I miss from my part of Texas,") exceptional service, not good,  EXCEPTIONAL!!!!
The service was so exceptional I honestly cannot tell you who my server was but in the end Mesa (My OPOLIGIES if spelled incorrectly)  is the individual server that picked up my check HOWEVER  one person greeted me at the door, another met me at my table and ask ABOUT drinks, another brought the food to the table, and upon my eating it was almost celebrity Service.

As there was constant attention of do you you need this, do you need that etc..
This day I was multitasking and I was on the phone (witch I hate to do especially while eating) my counterpart could  hear the service  and asked if I was in uniform.  (I was not)  it was just exceptional service The meal was exquisite. The service phenomenal.

Had to wait a bit, but I CLEARLY understand why.
I will start being my team, and club members to this location.

Again MESA I advised you I would add your name to my Review & and done so, You ALL were GREAT...
See you soon.< /text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP2CykRBYWnFRW_BFmhdk55OyVofITMKH72bk8_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< Response>

I am so glad that I went. Although the parking is extremely limited, parking is available along the roadside. When I saw the clientele, I knew it would be good. These were locals who live and work in the area (who could easily drive a few blocks north or south for other food), so I expected it must be good. It is decorated nicely in a fresh and comfy way. This restaurant is clean! I was very impressed with how much attention is paid to it by the owners. The food is plentiful and yummy. They had a menu with a variety of breakfast and lunch items. The service was quick and super friendly. All of our food was cooked perfectly. My mom said their coffee was delicious. I loved their homemade salsa/ sauce.</review>

Long wait once we were finally called we noticed several empty tables. We ordered coffee we had to ask for refills several times because no one was coming around with coffee plus we were missing the flavored creamer that every table had but ours. They forgot our side order of fries. Staff was not friendly. Will not be back<//Review>

On a business trip decided to give this place a try due to other reviews. I was not misled. This is a small place, if your heading north on Vineyard and catch the light to tunn on 8th you'll like drive right past. It's right at the corner, don't miss it. inside is nice and friendly and the staff is helpful and attentive. I was recommended the chicken fried steak for breakfast and wanting the best of both worlds I did the diced chicken fried steak omelet. I saved on lunch because I was still stuffed when lunch time rolled around. Everything was well prepared and not over cooked. I will say take it a little easier on the gravy over the biscuits, your biscuits are excellent and they just need about 1/2 that gravy to top them off. Also for all you business travelers they do not take Amex, yes we've all had that happen before, but I will say Johnny's was worth spending my personal money on, plus all that food is ridiculously low priced and if corporate thinks all California food is this cheap they'll try to reduce the per deim cost :-) . I'll be back....</Text>

<Text>The staff was super friendly and took great care of our party of six!

The food was wonderful,  burgers are certainly their thing and did not disappoint. I had the corned beef hash and it was among the best ever, truly.

Give Johnny O"s a try, it's a cozy joint so pack your patience and your appetite!<//Text><user_name>James Thompson< /user_name></record>

Pleasantly surprised! We had been to this site previously under prior ownership  ... it had been a typical 'greasy spoon.' Things have been elevated! Still a bucket load of comfort food on the menu but it's minus the 'greasy' part! We were here at Breakfast time while having our car serviced up the street (at The Auto Shop, a honest-to-goodness HONEST mechanic,  Al Davis). Greeting was very friendly.  Server Brian proved to be a pleasure. We decided to split the Chicken Fried Steak & eggs plate as we had heard that the portion sizes here were quite generous. As our meal arrived, it had already been split in the Kitchen onto two plates and both were visually appealing. The food was fresh and tasty. Even though Brian brought us steak knives, they weren't necessary as we could cut through they protein with our forks. The biscuits & gravy were spot on and the home fries are a winner. Can't wait to try other menu items! We'll surely schedule our next car service accordingly!</Review>

<Date>1522727636411</Date><review>This place is okay, super busy so you get slow service and kinda cramped. Potatoes were so cooked they were charred on the bottom and they don't have sour cream. Scramble was the best part of eating here. Suggest going to Zekes eatin place a mile or two down the road instead.< /review></record></dataset><record>

Words cannot explain what a wonderful time the family and I had eating breakfast at Johnny O we ordered breakfast steak and eggs French toast with strawberries everything was delicious the service was great. It's small place, but if there was a line I would definitely wait in line to eat here. Place was very clean the atmosphere was great really had a wonderful time.</Review>

<review>The hamburger steak was fantastic for brunch. On a bed of homefries with 2 eggs and a side of biscuits and gravy the combo worked wonders. The house hot sauce that came upon request was also miles better than I thought it would be. Overall I was really surprised by the quality of this place and will definitely be back to try the other items on the menu.</review>< GmapID>

Man so these guys know how to make a steak sandwich. I will be back for another pretty soon. My wife loved her pancakes but I can't talk about that steak sandwich enough. The bread was crispy, the meat was perfectly med rare and the fries were fried perfectly. Now I see what all the commotion is about with this place.</Review>

I really like to seek out nice 'hole in the wall', intimate restaurants. Nothing wrong with small town feel, I say, where the people are friendly and you're valued when you walk through the door. This was exactly my experience this past Saturday morning. Our waiter was outstandingly friendly and attentive to details. We took his advice on the house favorites and were not disappointed: Chicken Fried Steak and Meat Lover's Breakfast Burrito with chorizo added. Give this small place a try.<//text>

Awesome place for a typical brunch. It's a quaint place and standalone for a typical American food. The chicken steak omelette and the classic breakfast are those that we ordered and it was top of the world. Don't miss it.</Text>

<Review>Good customer service, very friendly but there seem to be two to cover the place so service might get stretched thin during peak times. Burgers were great! I've tried the Cali and the Western and the meat was seasoned just right for my taste. I've tried two sandwiches and they would be what you'd expect from your above average diner. Burger/sandwich plates are around $11. Breakfast seems to be popular, most patrons had that while I was there eating lunch.< /Review>< pictures>

<pictures>None< /pictures><text>This space was the perfect greasy spoon to visit on our trip to San Bernardino/Ontario, CA. The staff were friendly, accommodating, and I never had to even think about asking for a coffee top up; the coffee flowed in abundance. The home fries were perfectly spiced and if you like to decorate your food and palate, the options do not disappoint from the house made hot sauce to fresh pico de gallo. Omelettes were tasty, too!<//text>< Date>

Great breakfast cafe.
A bit on the smaller side.... but, won't make a difference unless you are claustrophobic!!
Service staff is friendly and attentive, plus your order won't take too long!<//text>

Cute little diner with the best customer service. They are not stingy with the food either! There's not a lot of seating so expect a bit of a wait time but it's worth it. A lot of stuff to choose from and it's all delicious.</Review>

Hella good burger joint, but they sometimes make you work for it with unreliable hours(closed certain days), but sooo worth it. Call ahead to make sure they're open so you don't get disappointed after driving over there. I think it's kinda part of their charm. I haven't personally eaten breakfast here, but I've heard raving reviews and it looks amazing when I see it coming out for other tables. Huge portions and really great tasty burgers and onion rings.<//review>

<Review>Great people,  food is amazing. Their chili is some of the best. Be careful portions are big. As their sign has gobble tell you wobble.Still one of my favorite places to eat,  and all of the omelettes ate made with 5 eggs.< /Review>< Pictures>

<Review>Went here for a New Year's Eve morning brunch. It's a small spot and they were swamped by the holiday crowd, but the wait staff was busting hump. Kitchen wasn't fast but it was good considering the crowd and the servers did their best to care of us while we waited. The food is classic American comfort stuff and the servings huge. The price is great. Definitely wanna go here again when they aren't getting their butts kicked but a holiday rush. Great place to go if you wanna eat alot of food for not so much money and appreciate a hard working staff. Great place.< /Review>< user>

The outside could use an upgrade but it's not too much of a problem. The inside dining area is about the size of a living room but has a lot of character.  The servers were really friendly in a way that seemed genuine. As in they were happy to be polite rather than only doing it otherwise they might get fired or something. It took a while to get my order but it was worth it and I doubt the place is ever empty. It's a bit far from where I live but if I'm in town with friends id be more than willing to bring them too.
Just keep in mind that they may not take American Express cards. Idk why but that wasn't a problem for me.

Tldr;
Pros:
- Great food
- Great prices
- Great Service

Cons:
- A bit odd looking on the outside and could probably use some form of shading for those that have to wait
- if they raise enough space maybe they can expand the building a bit to seat more people< /review>

JOHNNY O's is the BEST 1960s Diner my family and I have ever eaten at.  The Burger's are Humongous .. Delicious .. the Fries .. Tacos , Omelettes .. Melts .. Steaks ; ALL mouth watering .  Very Affordable for the portions you receive. We've been customers since day one .. BUT most importantly it's the Staff .. JOHNNY , Brian , Veronica , Randy , Jenn .. that add the icing to a restaurant you will return to over and over .. year after year<//Review>

< review>
The outside could use an upgrade but it's not too much of a problem. The inside dining area is about the size of a living room but has a lot of character.  The servers were really friendly in a way that seemed genuine. As in they were happy to be polite rather than only doing it otherwise they might get fired or something. It took a while to get my order but it was worth it and I doubt the place is ever empty. It's a bit far from where I live but if I'm in town with friends id be more than willing to bring them too.
Just keep in mind that they may not take American Express cards. Idk why but that wasn't a problem for me.

Tldr;
Pros:
- Great food
- Great prices
- Great Service

Cons:
- A bit odd looking on the outside and could probably use some form of shading for those that have to wait
- if they raise enough space maybe they can expand the building a bit to seat more people<//review>

This space was the perfect greasy spoon to visit on our trip to San Bernardino/Ontario, CA. The staff were friendly, accommodating, and I never had to even think about asking for a coffee top up; the coffee flowed in abundance. The home fries were perfectly spiced and if you like to decorate your food and palate, the options do not disappoint from the house made hot sauce to fresh pico de gallo. Omelettes were tasty, too!<//text>

Awesome! Huge portions! Quick friendly service, very attentive. Came here with a bunch of 16 year old boys and we were surprised at the portion size, even more than they could handle. All the food was fanstatic.< /Review>

<review>Great food, great service, and HUUUGE portions! My family of four went there for breakfast and everyone left happy and stuffed, unable to finish the plates. I was especially happy with the French toast which wasn't soggy in middle like many places. They were thick and oh so good. Pricing was very appropriate too. Only $26 for all 4 of us. Definitely recommended.</review>< Pics>

Very good food but poor service not enough help. I ordered coffee with my meal and had to wait for the waittres to finally come around so i asked for a coke instead and got charged for the coffee due to the poor service. It also took about 15 minutes to get our food.<//Text>

< Review>
This little breakfast joint does it right. The food is juat amazing and just as amazing is the customer service. The whole crew is on it. If you like spicy try their habanero salsa. Also their lunch is prettt good with juicy burgers and great chilli. One of my all time favorites.</Review>

<review>My phone order placement Experience is horrible .. I called (10:55am) ahead so my food can be ready within 30 to 45 mins as I was advise it will take that long . When I got there 11:35am (I literally live down the street) I still waited  5  more mins just for the cashiers to tell me they gave my food away on another pick up order .. I was really looking forward   to eat a delicious breakfast  however  just get really upset &  disappointed 😔.<//review>< Rating>
