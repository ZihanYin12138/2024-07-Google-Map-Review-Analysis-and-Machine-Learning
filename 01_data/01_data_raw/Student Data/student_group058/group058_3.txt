<Text>Don't waste your money and time! It took more than a month to deliver part of my order. After many texts, calls, and visits to the store. When they came to set it up, they were missing the hardware, one piece was broken, and they were missing part of the order. They told me to wait 2 more days. A week later they came without the proper hardware again and couldn't put my furniture together. Once again they said "wait for our call, I will recommend to my supervisor to order a new set because the thread where the screws go now are messed up because we(them) tried to put in the wrong ones." It's been more than  3 weeks, and I am still waiting for them to call me. My order was made in March 20. Now, we are in May almost June and my things still on the floor waiting for them to come to fix it.< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None<//Response><gmap_id>0x80952eb9d178dba1:0x117f0cbfed913b17< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

!!!! Would not recommend this place dont waist your money at all when i went to get some couches i was charged the supposably store price when they had it advertised for cheaper on offer up when i realized i was charged  a different amount than what the ad says i called them and  they said i was suppose to had showed  them the ad so that i could had got them at the sale price when no where in the ad does it say you have to show the ad to them to get it at that price false advertisement they refuse to give them to me at the ad price and when i got them delivered a few days later the quality is not what i was expecting bad quality of couches for the full price and the store manager so unprofessional.
Dont recommend at all!!!!!!</text>

<name>Deidra Johnson< /name><Text>I would give them a zero if I could. We put some items on "layaway"  and we had changed our minds on the items. We were NEVER told that if we canced our layaway that we would not get our money back. The general manager was just so excited to make a 4,000.00 sale from us and still did not say anything about the fine print about canceling our layaway. So now we have 550.00 in store credit that we cant use because we have already furnished our house. His last words were we do anything to make our customers happy. My last words were no you don't  because we are not happy and you could be making an exception since we just spent 4,000.00 here.</Text><user_id>100965262434875352738< /user_id>< pics>

<text>Sal was great. Found what I wanted and got it on time. Great place to get furniture from without having to worry about paying too much. As a precautionary measure one of the beds appeared to have been tampered with so much so that they feared it was missing pieces or damaged. To make sure we get what was expected, they sent it back and ordered another one. Taking an extra step to provide great quality and customer service is always a plus in my books. Thanks again Sal. I will be back soon to get some things.<//text><rate>5</rate><pictures>None</pictures><user>112526112069264354928< /user>< date>

<Rate>1<//Rate><Text>Spent thousands of dollars on a table with chairs, couches and beds and mattresses. Paid extra for them to deliver and put it together. They said it would be delivered in two days and wasn’t delivered for a week and a half. Then when they finally delivered it (at 8pm) it was the wrong table and couches, pieces of the bed were missing, no mattresses and the guy was complaining and cussing about having to put it together even though we paid for them to do that. Then got mad because we complained about them being the wrong couches and table so he left them in our living room still in boxes. We STILL do not have our furniture we paid for. There are better places to buy furniture, don’t waste your money here!</Text>< Pictures>

I got a bed 6/14/20 it's now 7/28/20 I'm still waiting on it to get here now I called every week and they dont answer. Price might be cheap and affordable reason for that you wont recieve your order until they want to send.  Dont go here do yourself a favor and go somewhere legit!</Text>

Went to buy a rug. They are a bit pricey for the size I wanted. They have a HUGE selection of nice rugs. The gentleman that was working the day I went was super nice and helpful.</review>

My second time coming here. My first time I purchased a sectional and today I went in for a mattress and a dining table. I was given a good deal on the table and they delivered it all the same day! Everything was fast and easy! Staff and helpful and supportive! Thank you! Will come in again for my next purchase!< /review>

They have good customer service but not well explained that you are leasing or renting your furniture. Some how though my phone recorded the conversation between the sales lady and I and I can not hear where she said rental or lease. JUST READ THE CONTRACT BEFORE SIGNING😬😩😳</text>< pics>

Don't believe the 4 star rating this company is getting. They are very nice until they have to deliver. Then they turn the other cheek and make u pay a restocking fee and still disassemble the product and drive it back when they did wrong on their part. And they still have the audacity to tell us it'll be some extra charges for other things.<//Review>

<text>I am new to the area & went to this place, it had roaches, the man that talked to me would not stop pressuring me to buy something
& it didn't  help that he was flirting with me "told me I was pretty" super weird and probably worse furniture shopping experience I have ever had.....
they are a cheap quality store with bad people skills<//text>< pics>

Excellent customer service, I bought my bed here it was brand new mattress and came with a 25 year warranty. I was told that they do also offer cheap refurbished, not used, mattresses, but I told them I wanted all new mattress and that’s what I was sold, and I’m very satisfied with my purchase. I will be back very soon. Ask for Abdul he’s super friendly and always takes care of me.<//review>

<Review>I was new in town and in need of furniture. I came to Rugs and Home Design. They have the best prices in town, very good section of bedroom sets, sofas, dining sets, etc. The employees are very nice and helpful, i had a certain budget for a bedroom set and they helped me find a very good quality set around my budget. They also deliver fast and setup. A very good place to buy furniture. Im definitely coming back for a sectional. Thank you Rugs!! 👍👍👍</Review>< Gmap_id>

for a small business they're very reasonable! I purchased a vanity & bed set from there. I'd have to say Sam definitely gave me the best price in town & the bed frame & dressers are sturdy, good quality.. overall I would definitely  recommend them to anyone looking to purchase furniture!< /text>

I got a sofa and loveseat. When I went to go pick it up two weeks later they were trying to give me a display set! I was upset and they agreed to order new ones which took another three weeks!!!! The only good part is that I got free delivery and set up. I will not buy from here again.</Review>

<Gmap_id>0x80952eb9d178dba1:0x117f0cbfed913b17< /Gmap_id><text>At first I thought this guy was legit. He said he sold quality Temper Pedic beds at a fraction of the cost, unlike other retailers. He said that he worked with a 15% mark up, and furniture places usually mark up prices like crazy, but not him. I believed him and purchased a Temper Pedic (like) bed from him. The bed arrived and I set it up. Then I found this orange label that stated that the bed was USED, SECOND HAND. Then the label went on saying how the bed has been sanitized correctly etc. So, this deal seemed to good to be true, and it was. This guy lied to me and I will never do business here again. There is a reason he has the lowest prices, it is used.  If you are looking to buy a rebuilt USED bed, well, you can find them here.</text><user_name>FreddyThaFish< /user_name><pictures>None< /pictures>< Time>

Once again George and team did an excellent job!  Had to replace the radiator.  No one likes to pay auto repair bills.  I must say I have always been happy with Espinoz's Prices.  I have checked aroound in the past.  Now I trust George I feel no need to check.
Want an excellent place to take your car.  I suggest

<Text>Took my LS swapped S10 to Espinoza's to have custom A/C lines made and they came out perfect. Upon completion, Jorge told me that I would need to install a thermostat switch at the evaporator given I'm using a single pressure transducer, instead of high/low pressure sensors, with a fixed displacement compressor. I'm not knowledgeable when it comes to A/C so I did some more research, and sure enough, Jorge was spot on. Installed a thermostat switch and now the compressor cycles like it's supposed to. Would recommend Espinoza's to anyone!<//Text>< resp>

This guy tried to charge me $600 parts and labor for brakes and rotors on my 2012 equinox. $600!! I called around and for the same job $300-350 tops! I ended up going to pep boys and getting the parts for $120 and doing it myself. So if you want to over pay go here, shop around people don’t get ripped off!!</review>

<review>Had some work done on my Pontiac. Espinoza's was fast, honest, and informative through the entire process. They tell you the problems and don't overcharge you or throw in needless services. Its a difficult thing to find a trustworthy mechanic. Espinoza's Automotive has filled that spot for my wife and I. We will definitely be going to them for any future vehicle issues.< /review><user_name>Westley Dingman< /user_name><GmapID>0x80dca62131de43cf:0x6cb792252dfb73e6< /GmapID>< Pics>

Excellent service, excellent people and what made me a repeat customer is that they actually sent me a thank you letter for using their business.....I mean nobody does that anymore? I will be telling everybody I know to use them for any vehicle issues, and trust I can see why they're so busy.<//Review>

<review>I have been taking my cars to Jorge for repair for over 10 years, He is very good at what he does. He make you feel that you are at home when you enter his shop. He is a profession by all means. He is a very honest man and the work that he does at is shop is superior. I would not let on one else work on my vehicles. I live in Modesto California, I still have family in Moreno Valley and they take there cars to Espinoza Auto Repair for all repairs. Jorge is a wonderful person and is one of the best if not the best Auto repair shop in Moreno Valley...< /review>< Time>

I will never do business here again ... my breaks were fix after 2 1/2 hours and I was told only a 45 min fix, but what held them up was due to them fishing for other problems that I did not ask for ... I understand and appreciate them going the extra mile but once it was understood that I was on a time limit and I would just come another day Than at that point the expectations was set from a hour in a half to 45 min. You would think for the inconvenience they will cut a break on the price .. NO ! I paid every bit of it. I understand time is money , but my time is also Money also..< /Text>

I'm extremely picking on where I get my vehicle service or worked on . So for me to leave a 5 Star rating is a extremely rare . Espinoza's Auto not only do they deserve the 5 Star but I would rate them much higher if I could . From their customer service to the quality of work they did was excellent . I would diffently recommend them.< /Text>

<text>My family and I were loyal customers... until Espinoza hired this man named Marcos or Marquis, whatever the heck his name is. This man was pushy and aggressive. When I went to pick up my car after they charged 100 dollars to “diagnose” it, the idle adjustment screw had to be loosened after they screwed it in all the way, the car sounded like it was going to explode and I could not use my brakes, it was very scary... Then they actually had the audacity to tell my parents it would take 1300 dollars to fix my 2000 Toyota Camry, we soon figured out that nothing in fact was wrong. One minor hose needed to be changed on it,they manipulated my car and made something wrong with it to make a big profit.. PLEASE BELIEVE ME AND STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE. I don’t want anyone to experience what we did.<//text></record></dataset><record>

I was looking to get a Catalytic Converter fixed. Jorge advised me to come in and let him have a look. He looked at it and told me it wasn't the Catalytic Converter it was the Flex Pipe and referred me to the right people. Honest man thank you Jorge.< /text>

Excellent customer service! Can’t beat their prices. I came late and they were very friendly and got me back on the road quickly, barely waited and they did the job right! Thank you guys, your shop is the best in town, and I’m very picky and shop around for the best prices so trust me when I say that they are the best ones in town!<//review>

<text>Definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for any car services! They are honest, professional, and provide great customer service! Raj took the time to talk to my husband and explain everything in detail. He even offered (and did) send pictures/texts to us as he made progress on the car! And you can't beat their price! We left feeling completely confident and trusting we wouldn't be overcharged- which is hard to find with car places! I would send my own family here first. Support this family owned business! We need more car shops like this!!<//text><Pics>None< /Pics><GmapID>0x809ad7c9ab49653d:0x9b2d0eb3dc062f7<//GmapID><user_name>Shelly Middleton< /user_name></record></dataset><record>
<review>This place is amazing! Been going here for years, through old cars and new. They never hose you and will actually do their best to Save you money!! A mechanic? That backs their work AND saves you money?!?

That said, don't go here. I need all the appointments available for ME! 🤣</review>< Name>

<review>They are a good group of guys who you can tell take their job seriously as well as making sure customers are happy. I thought they were a little high for a smog check ($58) but since it was a Saturday and because of covid, alot of places require and appointment so I sucked it up.</review><Name>tasha bullock</Name><user_id>106154995841841013740< /user_id></record>

<rating>5</rating><text>I bought a used tire at a very reasonable price that just happen to go flat 2 days after buying it. I went back with the thought that I had purchased a bad tire. No problem. They took it off, made sure there was no nails or anything that may have punctured it. Come to find out, my rim is slightly bent, and they show me where the air leak is at. It's at the bent of the rim. Long story short, they put some sort of seal on it, and had me pick it up a few hours later. I asked how much? They said, "No charge brother, just keep an eye on it." They also recommended a spot where they fix rims if need be. A whole week later, my car hasn't notified me of low tire pressure at all. It's been great since. Amazing people at this place. 10/10 would recommend<//text>< pictures>

<Text>Out of all my years going to different shops around Sacramento and Elk Grove, this shop tops them all. Just like a 5 star hotel, this is a 5 star shop. I am very knowledgeable when it comes to automotive but you’re always learning something knew. Raj did a superb job explaining in detail about my installation. Going forward I will take my car here for all further services! Tires, alignment etc. Name brand shops charge an arm and leg. This shop is great on pricing and puts there customers first while treating your car with care like it’s there and gives excellent customer service!< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None<//Resp><GmapID>0x809ad7c9ab49653d:0x9b2d0eb3dc062f7<//GmapID></record>

Upon walking in I was greeted with a nice lady who took my DMV paperwork to a mechanic there. He came back told me he couldn't do a break or lamp certification but recommend one for me. He then took down my information for a smog check and said it would take 30 minutes but only took about 10-15. He was really nice. It was only $50.00 flat. I would recommend going here.<//Text>

I have always been treated with respect when I have gone into the shop to get my car worked on. Sometimes as a women I feel like I get talked down to in garages and the like and this doesn’t happen at One Stop. I pop in to get an oil change and they get to work on my car as quickly as they can and their work is swift before I can get too comfortable in their waiting room. I trust them.</review>

<Text>Raj took the time to explain to me what hoses needed replacing and why. Non were cracked or broken but the wrong type of rubber.

I appreciated him for explaining instead of letting customer know it will be an extra $X.

I’ll for sure be back for any future work, thank you all!< /Text><pics>None<//pics><Response>None<//Response>< GmapID>

The most fraud mechanic in the town. Very disappointed from his repairs. Never ever go again. Charge you double for not doing proper work. Never recommend this shop for repairs. Stay away from this fraud. Even did not deserve a single star.</Text>

An awesome experience for a first time customer. Came here after reading some of the reviews and wanted to give them a try and see how it would work out and I gotta say it's been a good experience. I generally take my vehicle to the local dealer to have it serviced but this place has the same work if not better. The waiting area is clean and all the techs that works here and good at what they do. While I was waiting probably had about 5 customer walk in and out and it's amazing to see the same service for each one of them. Will be back< /text>

I went to One Stop Smog & Auto Repair due to my check engine light being on. They completed the diagnostics and even made minor repairs without charging me extra. Everyone was super friendly and even though I am not much of a car person, they gave me a detailed explanation of everything that came up. Overall a great experience and I would highly recommend stopping by if your car needs work or smog.< /review>

To start I'm not really too car savvy but I know a thing or 2 about cars. That being said I would recommend one stop smog to anyone who wants a no headache shop. I currently own a Maserati and Range so these cars require precise care. I been coming to Raj at one stop for years now and honestly wouldn't really know where else to take my car since I've had bad experiences with other shops trying to upsell stuff I don't need. Raj runs a very professional business and is always quick and polite with the service. I've done walk in and appointment and everytime it's been a easy process to get the car worked on. They have serviced most of my personal cars along with my family and friends and they all say the same thing that they're glad they found out about one stop smog. Thank you guys for always doing an awesome job.</Text>

They truly value what they do and how their customers feel. We were able to have our car fixed same day and the prices were affordable and fair. Gurpreet thank you for your wonderful customer service. We will make sure to return for our car maintenance needs. Glad our friends referred us to you guys! We will be doing the same!

<text>Very disappointing.I changed my brakes almost 5 mouths ago in this shop but there were some installation issues on my brakes when they gave it back to me . I asked them to fix it but they told me to comeback 3 months later and they'll adjust it. After 3 months I went there but they didn't fix it well and my brakes still have the problems.< /text>< response>

<Review>I wanna start by saying thank you to one stop smog for always going above and beyond for there customers. I have yet to go into any business where they don't require an appointment or a long wait for there customers. While waiting for my car to be done about an hour. I've noticed about 8-10 customers come in. Some seemed new and some old since they knew Raj or the owner it seemed like. I even got to talk to a customer whose name was John Gomes and he told me how he's been coming here for over 7 years and he wouldn't go anywhere else because of the way he gets treated and it always feels like a family vibe. Every customer said that they will be back and that's the case with me as well. Will be back and thank you again one stop for the excellent service.< /Review>< pics>

On the way home from work my tire was punctured by a small needle nose pliers. I was losing air fast. It was then I realized I was down the block from One Stop Smog & Auto Repair. They were about to close when I drove up, but realizing my situation they fixed my tire on the spot for 'Free' being that I was a regular customer. Also, in the past when I had them repair my car their prices were very reasonable. I know that because I would usually compare prices with other mechanic shops. Each time I had my car repaired they would explain in laymen terms WHAT the repair was and WHY I needed it. At times they even showed me with my own to eyes to see what part needed repaired. I'm not a gullible person by nature but I'm very skeptical. Especially when I see on TV mechanics taking advantage of customers. So, in conclusion One Stop Smog & Auto Repair EARNED my trust.  I highly recommend them for any Auto Repairs you may have.< /review>

The Google Review average is validation enough that this repair shop can get to a root cause, present a solution and deliver on the solution to the satisfaction of almost a perfect 5.0. There Sunday hours help me, like I am not able to qualify when my water pump went out on my Dodge truck. It is a common truck and a common part but being able to get my truck into a shop on a Sunday for work on Monday and have it ready by 11:00 am, was a huge relief. I would and have recommended this shop to friends and family.<//text>

Super duper pleased with the service here. My smog failed at another, smog-only location so I brought my vehicle here to have it troubleshot and fixed. They had it fixed the same day and at a third of what they originally quoted me. I was stoked enough that I had them do some additional suspension work. The repairs where quick and the cost reasonable and more importantly, I felt like they were really making an effort to minimize costs and repairs, something I much appreciated.< /Text>

Excellent costumer service! I came for oil change today without scheduling an appointment. They took me in within 20 min. Plus they checked my tires as two were low on air and added liquid in windshield tank and one more tank as both were at the low level. This is my 2nd time at this place. Thank you guys!</Review>

One Stop Smog deserves nothing but the best reviews for providing an exceptional display of service.

I was commuting this past Sunday morning from San Jose to Sacramento and ended up getting a flat tire around the Davis area. After switching out the flat for the spare, I knew I needed to find a replacement tire before heading back to San Jose that same night.

After searching online for mechanics open on Sundays, I found myself coming to One Stop at around 8:30am Sunday morning. Not expecting to receive any service yet (due to the fact that they technically didn't open until 9am), I was greeted by the gentleman running the shop who offered me immediate assistance before I could even make it into their office.

Within 30 minutes I was back on the road with a practically new Firestone tire for an INCREDIBLE price.

I would highly recommend coming to this shop!! Nothing but fast, friendly, and professional service!< /review>

These guys are awesome! They changed out a timing belt, new front and rear struts, plus full 105,000 mile inspection for my 2011 Subaru WRX and saved me over $1,500 compared to dealer quote!! I got multiple bids for this work and they were not only the lowest, but they did a great job. Even cleaned my engine! I recommend this family owned business to all my friends and family. I have spent the last couple years searching for a good mechanic and so glad I finally found the best in town!</Text>

Fast and very well priced service here!

I brought my car in to have a water pump put in and as soon as i drove up they came out to help me.  It was the end of the day and i had to leave the car overnight so they even offered to give me a ride back to my house!

Very nice people working here and very reasonable!< /Text>

These folks are great.  We are out of town customers needing truck service during a long RV trip.  They took great care of us, charged us a fair price and fit us in so we didn't lose any vacation and could make the best use of our time.  Thanks Raj and Mr. Singe</Review>

These guys do good work and are probably the most honest people I have ever met.  Lifters in my wife's van were making noise. One shop told me they could fix the issue for about $1800.  Second opinion from One Stop said he could fix it cheaply for about the same about but to do it right you would need to rebuild\replace the engine for about $3600.  He said the age of the van does not justify the expense.  Gave me tips on maintaining it and reducing noise.  Still runs just sounds horrible.  That was 2 years ago.  They will not gouge or do unnecessary work. I have met people in the waiting room who have brought their cars from 2 hours away to have this shop work on their vehicles.<//text>

I had to get a smog check for my daughters last minute so I didn't have time to make an appointment anywhere, but I called and they kindly said that I could just walk in whenever. The service was marvelous, the prices absolutely can not be beat. I recommend this place to everyone in the natomas area. Such nice people!</Text>

Been there 4 times in the last year to fix brakes. Very expensive Cheap parts and bad work. Yesterday I brought it to a real shop and my rotor just about fell off when they took off tire. Your so called inspection of my steering column consisted of jacking my truck up and looking at my truck for 30 seconds and telling me I needed a new steering column for over $1000.

You people shouldn't offer refunds publicly if you don't plan on actually giving one< /review>

Very fast and good service. Came in to get a smog And new tires. Smog was done within 20 minutes. They installed new tires and did a 4 wheel alignment on my car. The alignment was the cheapest in town. I got an additional discount on smog by just asking. Thank you very much for the service. Will be back!!!</review>

Been family shop for good 7-8 years got tired of getting different prices every time I need oil change or smog. I guess time to let my family know to stop doing business with them and go somewhere else.. you can always find quick and better service like SK.

HAHAHA FAKE REVIEWS HUH??

Had our Honda civic, toyota matrix, scion xb living on the same roof getting tires, smogs and oil change to your shop! And I don’t care if you think that this is fake. You may not remember me but it was your son or younger person that I always talk or deal with.</text>

Our prices have not really changed in over a few years and once a vehicle is serviced it receives the same prices doesn't matter about the time because we keep a full history of prices in our record data base. If you have any further question you cal call me directly at 916 922 4130 and ill be more then happy to take care of this but like i said earlier we have no record of you coming in and this seems like a fake review.

I've had the team of mechanics service my Volvo XC90 and Dodge Caravan several times over the last couple of years.  They've performed simple oil changes as well as more difficult diagnostics.  I found them to be more than fair with great customer service.  I recently took my car with A/C trouble in.  I am very familiar with automotive repair and have done a lot myself in the past, but A/C is foreign to me.  They were fast, professional and in my case the repair was very inexpensive.  They really seem to care.  If your car is giving you issue, take it in!<//review>

Mr. Singh and Gurpreet are the BEST!!! They worked on my car and they made everything easy, fast and convenient for me!!!

This shop is AWESOME!!! They are all very helpful, informative, fast, courteous and trustworthy. They always go the extra mile for their customers. Gurpreet dropped me off back to my house when they had to work on my car in their shop and picked me up when it was time to get my car back! Mr. Singh even lent me his own car just so I had a car to use as he was fixing my car!!!

They are very nice people and I will keep on coming back to them to have my car fixed!!! I also do my regular oil change with them. Great job guys at the One Stop Smog and Auto Repair!!! Keep up the great work and great customer service!!! ~Alonevi Suva< /text>

My wife of less than 48 hours and I just got to Sacramento on our first day of our honeymoon. Things were great as we had a brand new camaro convertible rental car until she lost her wedding band in the A/C vent while applying suntan lotion. Raji @ one stop smith was quick to help and reassure my visibly upset wife and was extremely helpful in comforting and promising her that he would find it. During a busy schedule he squeezed us in ASAP and returned the ring to my new wife within an hour for more than a fair price. Thanks to Raji and everyone at this shop for saving our honeymoon before it started!<//Review>

< Review>
our van broke down on ca-99  yesterday (forgot which exit it was) Btw, we are from oregon and still about 5 hours away from home. It also happened to be one of the hottest days of the year, 105 degrees. Everyone but two places were open. One Stop smog answered quickly and in a friendly way, they alao helped us with the number for a tow truck. Upon arrival they started checking the vehicle and provided a cool area for us to stay. in less than an hour the problem was fixed and we were ready to get back on the road ! thank you so much both of you, it was such a stressful day i didn't even get to ask for your names. but all i know is that they were brothers and the only two working that day. I'm so thankful beyond words for u guys! thank you for a great experience!< /Review>

Getting 'r smogged. PASSED as I expected. Prior to....
I went to local garage to get est for tune up and oil change. When I got there, my Service Engine Soon light flicked on. He immediatly told me it wouldnt pass smog and no tune up or oil change would help. He wanted to do a diagnostic for $89.
I left and the Service Soon dash light went off, I went over to my usual SMOG station and it passed.
My point is, it would have passed dispite the light. And I would have paid $89 just to find out whats wrong, plus whatever repairs he thought I should need. There is nothing wrong with my truck.
So One Stop just lost a one customer.</text>

i took my car in to them and first they were all about helping me and getting the car fixed but the next day they told me to come back another day so 3 days later still nothing then they said they didnt have the parts which is just fine but you should tell someone that your waiting on parts. the people there are rude as hell, my wife called to check on the progress and the POS manager decided that it is ok yo yell and cuss people out. really unprofessional< /review>

<Rating>1</Rating><review>Today i had a smog check. I went there because itsnclose to me, but also because it has 18 reviews and all scored 5!
Well, i would normallt scored 3, as average but seeing that 18 reviewer before me all scored 5, i decided to score 1, since this cant be simply true, so,lets start.
First impression, not professional : 1
Hygeene: 1, offices dirty
Safety for customers: 1, in the office i witnessed that a 6-7 year old boy was bitten ( mild bite, no blood) by a small dog that owners keep in the office and waiting area. Nothing against dogs, i have a dog too, but if owner knows his dog can bite ( and he knows, since he has written with big letters something like " dont touch teh dog dog can bite etc") than dog has no business in the shop.
Environment: 1, they left my car running for > 20 min, before even thinking beggiging to work on my car. I told employee 2, you would have other cutomers who do not like their car engine running if there is no need.
Customer Courtesy: 1, owner has condesending humor, secondly, my car front door was scratched, 1-2 inch small scratch,. They would not know, saying it was there already. I a not sure either, but i would not think is crazy that emloyee 2, did that on purpose after my comments on engine running for no reason.
I rarely writte a review, but could not resist this big discrepancy between google review average (5) and my experience ( 1).  So, guys, dont always trust google review, since in this case, they were mostly  fake, probably ordered or manipulatedo by teh owner. But think for yourself before you go to any shop or this one.<//review>< pictures>

They currently offer window pickup which I didn't mind too much. Thanks to Zack for giving me outstanding service I came in with no clue on what to get and he was not only very patient but also made great recommendations for me. Came in with a donation and walked out with double what would have been at other places. This is my favorite spot. Definitely one of San Francisco's best kept secrets.</text>< pics>

A colleague talked me into checking this place out and I'll just give my honest opinion of it.
I was warmly welcomed and the staff took his time to attend to my questions and gave me just what I wanted. The quality of the bud is damn superior to what I get elsewhere and the price is really worth it.
I see myself becoming a regular here 👍🏼< /review>

<text>If you are visiting San Francisco then you have to visit Blessings. Best place in the world! Everyone is so kind here. I don't think I have ever met anyone that was rude. I definitely feel at peace here. I wasn't sure at first, but now its like my second home. I have met several people through this church and I don't think other places can offer that same level of well-being as this place.< /text><username>Mr Jetset USA<//username>< Pics>

What a soul lifting and positive messages shared on Sundays💒.
It feels so good to relax after the service and have a good smoke  in a nice environment.
This place is full of kind people offering amazing services and quality weed all around
I'm a regular here and it's been great all along
I joyfully recommend Blessings Ministries</review>

I visited here a few times and really enjoyed the fellowship. They don't press religion down anyone's throat, but its nice to be surrounded by believers in the oneness Christ.<//text>

Burlington was great!!! Found what I couldn't find at 4 other stores and some extras. Including some slippers that I am now proudly wearing to help keep my cold feet warm. The store is clean and ample. Staff was helpful and guided me to the items I was looking for. Will definitely be back another time.</text>

The store is clean and organized. Plenty of room to walk about and social distance. The staff is helpful and friendly. We have always had positive experiences with their team. Found some great deals.<//Text>

<Rate>1< /Rate><Review>When my Mom and I checked out 5/16/21 close to 4pm, they called us to register 4 yet no one was there and they continued to check out others after us even though they knew we weren't being helped. We should have just left the things on the counter and left but we demanded another cashier to ring us up and she complained because she was about to ring someone after us up. We will not be returning to this location the rest of this year, maybe next year they will improve their service.< /Review>< Pics>

They need to fix that metal detector when you leave because the security litterly took everything out the bag and wasted 10mins of my life just to find out the jewelry box was the issue and when he asked the clerk to take it off she said its still gonna OFF anyways. Over there looking at the security with my eye twitching like all that for nothing and still beeps ! Other then that customer service was great.< /text>

For a coat factory they seem a little expensive. Waffled on a coat took my time came back a week later and missed my opportunity. I got some Calvin Klein oxfords I know regularly going for 89 to 119 for 29 here at B Coat. Great prices on over the rack suits too leaves plenty of room to get them tailored.<//text>

I found some 5xl shirts for good affordable prices for a friend of mine. And I also found some very wide pants in his size too. Now my friend can dress better without worrying about the prices. Burlington is definitely a place for finding men's big & tall. Highly recommend for anyone who seeks any size of clothing.< /Review>

It's a Burlington coat factory, I'm not sure what you expected, but I am reminded of the style and quality of shopping experience of any place with the word 'factory' in its title. Pizza Factory in Temecula comes to mind, though ironically enough Spaghetti Factory in San Marcos was great. This location was clean and well ordered. Good selection at great price point. Would come back to buy socks and undershirts again.<//text>

I wish I came to this place sooner.  Ryan was professional, friendly and a great guy...as well as the staff.  Had my fiancée motorcycle tank brought here for a dent repair and they removed all the dents we couldn't see.... PLUS they had the tank flushed and primered the whole thing so it was ready to be painted (which we were going to do much later)!  It looked so good that my lady wanted to have it painted by them...and we weren't disappointed.  It came out near perfect.  I suggested any motorcycle rider bring their repairs here first.  Prices are reasonable and the turnaround time was short.</review>

<text>Thank you for going above and my expectations.
It's a great feeling when someone does something for you without expecting it.

I was referred to this shop by a friend and once I went there Liz was so helpful and professional. She’s kind and a straight shooter which I love. She’s knowledgeable and a people person. My car looked great when I picked it up. This shop did an excellent job and I would recommend them to anyone.</review>

After a recent accident I was looking for a shop to have the work done. A co-worker of mine suggested Inland Empire Autobody and Paint after his car needed repairs and wasn't satisfied with the shop he had taken it to, he took it to Inland Empire Autobody and said he was really satisfied with the results so suggested I check them out. I'd visited before to get a quote on a paint job but sold the car before I could follow through. I spoke to Liz the first time and she put my worries to rest about the body work and suggested it be done especially if there was any hidden damage. I then spoke to Nick the second time and occasionally Liz, both of which had the most positive and uplifting spirits. They kept my worries extinguished and after dropping off the car I waited. Since it was being done through the insurance, it did take a bit of time but nonetheless the vehicle came back amazing and shocked me! They detailed it at a very reasonable price and removed all my scratches and scuffs and also made sure the area that sustained the most damage was fully repaired and cleaned. I'll definitely be returning in the near future to get my entire car touched up and made to look new again! If you do need any body work or detailing done I highly suggest you stop by and ask for Liz or Nick. Tell them who sent you, they're really friendly and know how to make a customer feel valued! Huge thanks to you guys for showing me how a customer should be treated! Definitely earned a lifetime customer 💕</text>

I've been in 3 accidents in my Subaru sadly, but all 3 times i've brought my car to be repaired & this shop always does a great job. Very nice professional staff Nick has assisted me all 3 times and has handled it well, good communication with me and my insurance company. Highly recommend this shop to anyone.< /Text>

Awesome place super friendly staff. I would like to thank Victor for taking care of my car and going through step by step on how they were going to repair and paint my hood with me. They went above and beyond my expectations, I was honestly blown away with the results and the attention to detail.. Thanks to all who had a hand in making my car look great.

I would highly recommend Inland Empire Autobody & Paint to anyone in need of body repair or paint.</text>

I brought my truck in to be painted mid January  of 2020, they had to take the lid off the bed to do the job. When they finally told me my truck was ready I came out to pick it up they informed me they misplaced two of the lids hold down clamps. I was told I could take the truck home and come back when they got the clamps. I had to come back two more times before they finally got the lid on properly. This wasn't finished until May 11th, almost 4 months after I paid them. Each time I drove back and forth I had to take time off of work. In no way was I ever compensated for my troubles. I will never recommend these guys to anyone. They are totally unprofessional.< /text>

One of the best places for service I have been to. From start to finish 100% excellent service started with Liz and her getting me all the info and help I needed to move forward. This is a place I will be using in the future and letting my family and friends know about the service they provide.</Text>

<Text>I'm tried of shady auto repair trying to pull a fast one. I'm new  to the area and have taken my car to numerous auto shops that just want to rip you off..I was in a bind looking for a trustworthy shop to do repair on my car. A friend told me about Inland Empire Autobody and Paint but most importantly they told me about Lucy and Iassc the owners.. They repaired my car at a price that was lower then expected and their attention to detail  was exceptional. They have great customer service, strive to meet your needs and repair you car in a timely manner..I will be taking my vehicle to them from now on. Also I will recommend them to my friends and family.. Its good to know I have a place I TRUST..</Text>< pictures>

I took my Tahoe here to have some work done and what a great experience from start to finish. They had my car done 2 days earlier than quoted. Can’t say enough about how friendly and professional the people are there, and the price was super fair.....AND they washed and detailed my car inside and out beyond belief. This is, by far, the best body and paint shop I’ve ever dealt with. Thank you Lucy, Liz and Victor!!!!<//Review>

<text>I took my car here to get fixed they had it for 2 weeks, and now I have to jump start my car every time I leave and it won’t stay started. They’re saying it’s nothing they can do because it’s not their fault, mind you I had my car for almost a year it’s a 2016 and never had any problems with it until I took it here plus my bumper what they supposedly have fixed isn’t even all they way on my car. I would advise anyone to not go here and look else where to get your car fixed because this place isn’t it. I wished I would’ve looked at the reviews before coming here I really regret taking my car here because now I’m basically out of a car and I have no way of getting around with my 1 year old daughter. This place really doesn’t care the only thing they care about is getting paid and that’s it and it’s really sad because people have responsibilities and families to take of mean while they got paid and I have to miss work and figure out what I’m going to do smh !.

Only thing positive I can say is that the customer service is good.</text><pictures>None<//pictures><response>{'time': 1574100641769, 'text': 'Hi Myesha, we do apologize you feel this way.

I had the best experience with I.E.A.P, from the moment Liz answered the phone she made sure to provide the best quality care. She made sure to answer all of my questions and keep her word. She has the best personality and will make sure to keep you smiling the entire time (EVEN DURNING THE PANDEMIC). The shop took their time making sure my truck was fixed to perfection. They have it looking like new. The color matches perfect you could never tell it was in a wreck. Thank you to the entire team for working through the pandemic and getting my truck back to new. You guys are rockstars and I really appreciate the hard work. Thanks again Liz for keeping me calm and worry free. Ohhh I forgot to mention they have the best prices in town!</Text>

I brought in my 2013 Chevy Malibu to them after I was in an accident and the minute I stepped inside the office they were so nice and respectful. Nick helped me out and kept communication with me while they had my car. They even removed dents I had on my car that wasn't caused by the accident.  They did an AMAZING job. I reccomend this shop if you want quality work.<//review>

<resp>None< /resp><text>I recently went to this place and asked for just a quote for a repair. I told them this was my first quote to see if they would be fair on the services. They told me 4100 when I was estimated at 2450 prior to. They obviously are trying to take advantage of their customer to make a profit. I had them itemize what was going to be repaired and 3 of the issues they mentioned were falsified. But their customer service was good but would be negated at the fact they lie to your face.

Inland Empire Autobody and Paint did a FANTASTIC job on my 2017 Nissan Murano.  Victor handled everything from the beginning to the end with daily updates on the parts and promised two days to do all the work. Inland Empire Autobody delivered my car in just over a day.  They matched the paint, the car was detailed and looks better than ever.  Thank you Victor and your crew at Inland Empire Autobody and Paint.</review>

<review>We love our truck but the paint was beginning to show age.  So we gave Tony a call and he said to come on by, he would give us a great deal with quality work. When we brought the truck in for the estimate we received just that, a great deal. They were caring and understanding of our needs. We felt comfortable trusting our truck here. The day I dropped off the truck to be painted I did not have a way home. Not to worry, Tony was right there to give me a ride home. Great service, caring, and kind employees, this is my kind of place to do business. When we returned to pick up the truck it was beautiful, shiny and bright, just like new. We were very pleased with the quality of the work.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

Replaced/Repainted fender does not match the car
That was painted by them originally.
Body does not line up door and fender rub when opening and closing.
I hane pits and bubbles.
Over spray on my chrome bumper and rocker panels.
Trim reinstalled poorly may fall off on the freeway.
Nuts and bolts are missing from fender.
Constantly mislead on the time of completion.
Phone calls never returned ,I always had to come in person .

When I questioned Victor  about thes things they said "Sorry theres nothing we can do"

<Review>The Moreno Valley Collision Repair & Auto Painting has done a superb job on the repainting of our vehicle and price for the work. It has a factory look and they did an excellent job of masking areas that were not to be painted. There is no overspray in the wheel wells and they did more than was required at no extra charge. They were timely and professional. I highly recommend this business for your painting needs.< /Review>< Pictures>

We took a Cadillac here for repair of lot damage that occurred while we had the vehicle in our shop for mechanical repairs. As one can imagine, both quality and speed of turn-around was of chief importance to us because we wanted our customer - the vehicle's owner - to be completely satisfied. The good guys here at Moreno Valley Collision did a superb job on the car and turned it around in no time. This was our first experience with them. They're now our go-to body shop for anything we may need and we'll recommend them to anyone in need of body repair.< /review>

<Text>Unfortunately, I had to visit here twice in the last six months for body work due to two accidents. But, the experience from Lance, Cherri, and Brian were fantastic. Their customer service and the way they completed my car both times was exceptional. Good price and good customer service.</Text>< user_name>

< Review>
After 4 1/2 long months of fighting with the other persons insurance company they finally took liability and I needed to find a collision facility. I googled and found this one. Thank you google. They were amazing and did a great job. When I picked up my car on Friday but had the car I borrowed they followed me home to drop off the car while they washed mine and got it ready for me. I had a few concerns and took my car back on that Monday and they looked right in to it. My car was a mess when I took it but now it’s back to normal. I would recommend them to anyone.</Review>

<review>I had my 02 Honda Civic painted here; a single-stage with Urethane and I have to say my car turned out BEAUTIFUL.  Much better than I actually expected. I dropped my car off on Thursday morning and had it back Monday afternoon! Not bad at all when you also consider that they removed 12 dings and small dents in addition to the prep work and paint job. Extremely professional and A+ customer service and follow-up. I couldn't be more pleased overall and I highly recommend this shop to any and all of whom are considering giving their precious rides the perfect face-lift. My car looks brand new.<//review><time>1435769549175<//time>< user_name>

<Text>I wish they would incorporate negative stars! I brought my vehicle to this location because I live in Moreno Valley. I like to help my city. But it bit me in the but. To start off, it took them a month before I had to contact them for a status. Second, they were suppose to paint more pieces of the car as agreed upon. Third, they charged me for them sanding down the ehtire car and they did not. There were pits and scratches that were still visible, I know my car wasn't in the best shape, but I work in an automotive shop and worked with body shops and know what a sanded car looks like. And to top it off they broke an emblem, they never told me of, I found it in my driver door pocket. I was so upset I didn't even want them to pay for it!<//Text>< pics>

The paint job and customers service  I must admit was great. The only reason am giving them a 3star is because the reason  I took the car there is back just less than a year after the job was done. I will go back and speak with the manager and see what he can offer me.</Text>

<Text>When I nudged a wall and dented/scratched my Honda, I got estimates from several places. Maaco Moreno Valley was the least expensive. More importantly, they gave me several options on how to save money. I ended up choosing the most expensive option and it was still cheaper than my other estimates. Dropped the car off on Monday morning and it was done by Thursday at close of business; just like they promised. They called me to let me know the car would be ready in plenty of time to arrange a ride from Hemet to Moreno Valley.

I dealt with Ruth and Bruno and they are the best! Both times I was there the office was very busy and they handled the people there and the incoming phone calls with superb professionalism.

If I should ever get in another accident I will go to Maaco Moreno Valley first to get my car fixed.</Text><Response>None</Response><user_id>116801155521129294373< /user_id>< Pics>

On a very windy day, someone's door flew open and hit my 2017 Silverado badly on the passenger's door. It hit so hard one of my letters came off, leaving a deep dent and a scratch.  I was highly recommended to take my truck to Inland Empire Auto body and paint in Sunnymead. Not only did they do the work in a timely manner,  my door seems like it was never hit,  thank you for your great job and great price. Love this place! Love these people.<//text>

You could get a better paint job for your vehicle by giving your kids paint for their squirt gun. They could not buff out the runs on the paint because the original paint would show through because of such a thin coating. Manager of building could not distinguish between Rock chipping and oxidation in the paint. I cannot emphasize enough you can do less damage with a rattle can please take your car elsewhere. I have paint on my carpet and over spray over other things that weren't supposed to have overspray. In case you're wondering how long the top of the line paint last it's four years 10 months but you have to deal with the divots and runs in the paint and I wouldn't recommend getting a Rhino liner on top of the paint because it peels Maaco paint right up< /review>

<text>I came in after a minor fender bender. They did a great job with my fender - it looks like new - and they were able to clean up a number of smaller cosmetic scratches and dents for a really reasonable price. The staff is friendly and helpful, and they work hard to provide good service for a reasonable price. Although there are other shops that are closer to my house, I will always drive the extra distance to get my autobody work done at Maaco.</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

<user_name>Anna Lujan< /user_name><pics>None<//pics><Review>Took my car in for extensive front end damage.  Was told my car would be dine in 3 days. Broke my phone and almost a week later g it a new one checked my voice mail. Not one message from these people. I had to contact them. Excellent customer service!!! Yeah right!!!!!! Then was told they couldn't reach me cuz a storm had caused their computer systems to go down but somehow they had my number, by memory I'm guessing (yeah right) was told some lame excuse about parts being ordered and just waiting on them. Then, boom!!! Nothing for days. By this time it's two weeks, still no car. About 3 days later I call and was told the "tech" forgot order the parts. What????? Wow!!! So now it's about 3 weeks and it's supposedly finished. COME ON DOWN AND GET IT! Go down, car isn't even put together. I mean really? Where did these people go to school? So another week and finally done. Horrible job!!! My hood has at least a 2 inch gap on the right side and is so close to the left it's so ridiculously noticeable. My head light keeps going out, reminder it was all front end damage. So I go in and tell the person who was I guess what you would call helping me that my hood is messed up and he has the audacity to tell me WE DIDNT REPLACE YOUR HOOD! OH YEAH YOU DID, I HAVE THE PAPER WORK. INITIIAL ESTIMATE AND FINAL. PULL IT UP NOW!!! He then proceeds to say OH YEAH WE ACTUALLY DID. YEAH NO DUH DUDE. I'M REPORTUNG TO BBB, CONSUMER AFFAIRS AND INSURANCE COMPANY. WHEN YOU DO FIX MY CAR YOUR COMPANY WILL BE PROVIDING ME WITH A RENTAL. ALSO MY DEDUCTABKE WAS 1000$ HE SAID TO GIVE HIM 500 CASH AND THE REST WOULD BE OK CUS MY INSURANCE PAID HIM WAY OVER WHAT THE ACTUAL DAMAGE WAS. BE PREPARED BECAUSE AT THIS POINT ALL ACTION IS AND WILL BE TAKEN<//Review>< gmap_id>

<Rate>5< /Rate><text>I came into the Moreno Valley location, met Lance, and received an estimate to paint and repair a small dent in my 2004 Chevy Silverado pickup. I later dropped the truck off at the scheduled repair time and picked it up a few days later. I was extremely HAPPY with the job MACCO performed on my "red" truck. My truck looked as good as the day I bought it. The paint job and small dent repair was perfect! My neighbors have commented how great my truck looks and were even more amazed when I told them how reasonable the price was for such a great job by MACCO. I highly recommend MACCO in Moreno Valley for any vehicle repair needs. Also, the Staff was very polite, professional and extremely knowledgeable. Thank you all for the best paint and repair job I could get anywhere.<//text>< Pics>

Stayed here for a men's retreat and had a blast. Cabins are a bit outdated but great accomodations. Staff made sure everything was good during our weekend and did an excellent job. Shout out to our event coordinator Caleb, he made our stay worthwhile. The views are stunning from every angle, trail hikes were fun and the obstacle course, Zipline were exhilarating! Didn't want to leave this place. Great place to visit and get away from the Hussle and bustle of the city. We enjoyed everything this place has to offer.<//text>

Beautiful location on the pond, especially gorgeous with the fall colors. Staff was wonderful. Food great too. Room we stayed in only had bunks, not ideal for couples, but hey, it's camp. And other areas near the Lake do have double beds so just ask so you know.<//review>

<Review>First off, thank you to all the staff that had helped me here when i was growing up with becoming a better person and giving me someone to talk to. Just wanted to leave a review because i grew up coming here in the 2000's to early 2010s and this place changed my life, the bridge that you walk over in the middle of the camp in particular. I sat on that thing and stared down the valley almost all of the day, the freedom you feel being here is splendid. It gave me a new perspective on life but also reminded me how short it is. Met some good friends there that i sadly no longer talk to, even my first girlfriend. I hope everyone i met here is doing well in life. I gave this review 4 stars out of five only because I feel like the quality of the experience going here to camp isn't what it used to be with the changes to certain parts of the camp, but things always come to an end and life goes on. Also some solo time here is necessary to soak it all in

if you have kids and want to build a closer bond with them i highly recommend this camp and the soul purification the beautiful surroundings have to offer. Do everything in the camp. i plan to visit again sometime for the day with a close friend just to remind myself what a blessing it was to be here even though i'm no longer religious.
Come in winter when it snows too.</Review>< pics>

Staff great, for the most part, but the beds are uncomfortable and the cabins are in bad shape.
The food used to be good but the last couple of years it also got really bad. Bland, low quality for sure. The chicken was so rubbery and tasteless I passed on it and drove 10 mile to the supermarket.
Our church has had their retreat there for for over 10 years. We switched because people stopped signing up for the reasons I mentioned.< /Text>

<Text>Great customer service. Quick to resolve issues with equipment with a smile and not over charge. Also very convenient to have an All Star rents in our area. I like getting the job done with All STAR.<//Text><time>1604981683726</time><resp>None</resp>< username>

Delivered on time, picked up in time, the lift was new, operated amazingly and did the job in 2 1/2 hours compared to a day and a half if done without it. A big savings of time and improved safety.< /review>

Called ahead, the item was waiting when we walked in the door.  The person at the counter (Kim?) was quick and and courteous.  Being new to the area the advise I received from her appreciated.<//Text>

<review>I rented a man lift from this location over the weekend to trim oak trees on my property.  As with all equipment there can be unexpected mechanical problems but I was super impressed with how both Kimberly and Lonny handled the issues I had with the lift.  Kimberly made it clear that she was available and willing to do anything in her power to be sure I got the job done.   She even made herself available on the weekend after the store was closed and was genuinely interested in having me update her to make sure I got things worked out.  She really went above and beyond to make me feel like they were there to help.  Lonny was extremely understanding when checking the equipment back in and providing me more than ample credit to offset the problems I had.  Although the equipment I rented had problems come up I was very impressed with the way Kimberly and Lonny handled the situation.  I really could not have asked for anything more from a business.  They have certainly earned my continued business.  Thanks again!< /review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

Thank you Kim. It was great having the equipment ready after I drove over 600 miles to complete a job. We had to put this job on hold until you got the truck available. Thank you for the great smiles and great service!!</Text>

<Text>When I called for renting questions they are always polite and treat me like the most important person needed help.
Lonnie who was the person who last help me when I was renting a lift was right on it and got me my equipment right on time and even called to ask did everything go ok.
I not only will be using All Star Rents in future but recommending their services to others.

Thank you

They don’t tell us that it will not work on a hill more than a 3% grade,  so it locks up when we try to position it.  They come to fix it and tell us that we cannot use it for more than a 3% grade.  They get it back to the street and ask us if they can leave it in front of our house until Monday.  Ok.  We wait all day on Monday for them because we have the keys.  They show up Tuesday and take it back to their shop.  Later they call and tell us there is damage on the back of the machine, and 6 hours of use.  Also they are going to charge us for pick up and delivery.   We did not get to use it and we did not damage it.  In the end they charged us $350 for???????   We should have charged them for babysitting their machine for the whole time!!  $350 for nothing!<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

Highly recommended location in Placerville!!!  Awesome staff that is willing to work with you.  I've rented heavy equipment 2-3 times per year from them and I have ZERO complaints.  They have what you need when you need it with no hassle.  Including no hassle repairs if necessary.  This is the place to rent from!<//Text>

<username>Linda G< /username><Text>Worst Customer service ever!!!!  Dropped of large equipment via truck.  I noted that the gas tank was not full and the employee stated that it was OK just to fill it to the same level.  When the equipment was picked up it was the same employee that dropped it off and we were standing there with the gas can and he told us that was enough and he would take care of it.  When we got the bill they charged $23 for fuel.  We contacted the company and even though there were two of us that witnessed the employee's actions the management would not reverse the charges.< /Text></record>

<Text>My experience would have been better if there had been better communication.  I was told that i would get a call back on a day that I was trying to rent a forklift.  I called twice during business hours, but no one called me back.  The next morning I called during business hours and no one answered the phone again.  Finally, I called the emergency number because I needed to make arrangements immediately and it was becoming an emergency.  I was told then that they did have a forklift available and they would be sending it out.  It did come, but when the bill came it had an extra charge for diesel fuel.  Again, communication about this charge would have been appropriate.< /Text><pics>None</pics>< Response>

<gmap_id>0x809a573d6c0aac5d:0x599e0b2a891823d4</gmap_id><Review>Very unhappy experience with renting a 6" wood chipper. I booked my rental one day ahead so that next day I pick up the equipment at 7.00AM. (The chipper was in their yard but not serviced). Next day, the equipment was not ready and the person at the desk lied to me the equipment was not returned from prior rental. I told him I saw the promised equipment the other day and he nonchalantly told me: so, ok, the equipment is not ready, we are sorry! Well, I said:  based on your promises, I booked a truck for hauling and a person to help me work the chipper. So finally, they decide they may need like 20 more minutes to service it. Finally, by 8.15AM the equipment was "serviced". I reached my place at 9.00AM and by 9.30 we started working. At noon, we had a half hour break for lunch and continued our work till 3.30 PM (Was so hot like hell and neither of us was a spring chicken). As we could not finish the work I decided to keep equipment for one more day. Next day the equipment started showing very tired. The grinding blade was not sharp any longer and wood was crushed instead of being ground,  the chipper was not performing at all. On top of all this, at about 3.30PM the equipment went dead. I call the rental office and the guy asked me to hold the line. After 15 minute, he comes back on line, says: "thank you for holding" and the next second he puts me back on holding. After another 15 minutes of waiting I decided I had enough and turned off the phone. Resuming: first day equipment worked for five and a half hours and the second day for another 6 hours, so total we had about 12 hours in two days. I returned the equipment next day and told them I could not finished my work. The guy at the desk looks calmly back to me and says flatly: you've been working on the machine for 20 hours. Another lie...
It did not seem the guy cared not even a little bit of the work I was not able to do in spite of paying the equipment for two full days.< /Review>< resp>

<review>Great rental experience.  Nic Gouda was the rep and took care of us instead of trying to upsell like some other firms.  He spent the time to understand our needs and give us exactly what was needed and not some extravagant solution.  Would be a repeat customer in the future.< /review>< pictures>

<Review>I called, I looked, I waited for what seemed like forever trying to find a full size backhoe, not a kiddy kobota, some one suggested All Star, one call and it was promptly delivered the next morning. Was I thrilled, hell yes I was. The woman who served me was real friendly, and knew what she was talkin about...a rareity these days, give them a try for your next rental needs< /Review>< username>

In the past, I've had great experiences with the rental yard, in fact for more than 40 years when it was locally owned.  The "manager" Lonnie was going to charge me 2 days rental for a 4:00 Saturday until 4:00 Monday in spite of the fact that the store is closed on Sunday.  The policy in the past was late Saturday pick-up, same hour return on Monday, and charge for one day rental.  The person at the desk was not rude, just singularly indifferent, and when confronted with the logic that it was not going to be rented late that Saturday afternoon, remained unmoved.  This is not the "locally owned" rental yard I've always dealt with.  Too bad.<//text>

<text>My washer went out and this has become my go to out of convenience. The ladies who work here do a great job of keeping the premises tidy. The customers are friendly and most seem to be regulars. I've never had a problem finding a washer to use, even on a busy day. The only reason I am giving the establishment a three is because I believe the owner could do a better job with maintenance. While the workers keep everything tidy some of the machines could use a little tune up to ensure their best performance.<//text></record></dataset><record>

I have been at this facility about three times and can't say I like it. The attendant is sitting in his room most of the time while the hand soap containers are empty. You ask for help and only stares at you, maybe he doesn't speak English. I will not go back. Oh,!!! I found a tampon attached to a dryers inside. No soap in restroom......< /Review>

Quite nice place to wash clothes. Surprised to see the Asian American guy working there use toilet for 25 minutes without face mask.
So disappointed, because, it the face mask and social distance posted . He kept going in and out without the face mask .< /Text>

Clean location. Been coming here for about four months and have never had a problem with any machine. They have 5 different size washing machines (loads) and two sizes of dryers. I've never had a problem finding a machine even on busy days. The attendant doesn't do much but hang out on the table with his phone until he's needed or someone needs help. Besides catching him staring sometimes, he's nice enough.

They have a vending machine for detergent and dryer sheets in case you forgot, and they have 4 machines to make change.

They are limited on carts. It doesn't matter to me, but just letting ya'll know.</text>

Always clean and there is always someone there, for those rare times you may run into a problem with one of the machines.. your money is reimbursed immediately. Washers are always available and come in five to six different sizes and prices .. they are a bit pricey to wash but dryers are very reasonable.</Text>

Machine ate my $5 and now they are treating me like a criminal. I literally have came here every sunday for the past year and now they are treating me like this when it was their machine that messed up.. Come on. Waited over an hour and a half for the owner to show up and he never did. While I was waiting for the owner to arrive another lady was ripped off by the change machine. This business is just ripping people off for their hard earned cash then calling the customers criminals, I will never be returning.. Good job losing a weekly customer.<//Review>

This place was a nightmare for me and a few other customers. First off if something goes wrong with anything you do not get your money back, you have to fill out a little card and hope the owner will fix the problem. He doesn't. All he does is take the out of order sign off. All fixed. In the two hours I was there, the change machine took my money and one others. Three change machines only one was doing this. A lady pulled her clothes out of a washing machine to find out they were still soaking wet. Another lady used a dryer that doesn't dry at all just spins. The washing machine I used never rinsed my clothes, just went in to spin cycle with soap still on my clothes. The dryer I used took 70 minutes to get my clothes mostly dry. When the owner showed up we all went up to him with the problems we had and he called us all liers. The water on the floor proofed that the lady with wet clothes was not a lier. After fight with the guy for about ten minutes he gave all of us are money back. Don't go here.</text>

Great service. I forgot that I didn't order cheese on my pizza, but thankfully the delivery driver reached into his pocket and had a handful of those little mozzarella cheese cubes. 10/10 will order again.</Text>

Ordered a Buffalo Chiken Papadilla, and I received a plain chicken papadilla which was flavorless, the Garlic Parmesan Bread was VERY oily.  The Buffalo Wings were Tiny and Alright. Not a great first impression.< /text>

MY PIZZA HAD SO MANY CHEESES ON IT!  I called to complain but stood corrected. The toppings were hidden under the cheeses.  Best delivery pizza I've  had in a very long time. Prompt, hot, delicious,  what more could I say.

SUPERB!< /text>

This place is small but the employees make it worth it. The pizza is freshly made from quality ingredients. Sometimes, you can even watch them toss the dough in the air like you see in movies. The staff always works to get you the best deal possible and they are super friendly.<//review>

My order was completed and paid for online only for me to be called 2 minutes later and told it could not be fulfilled due to lack of management and staff shortage. I was told I will get a refund in 24 to 48 hours. Guess my kids will eat in 24 to 48 hours. This is absolutely ridiculous. And I used to love Papa Johns but I will never, ever spend another dollar with this establishment. Pure disgrace and poor customer service<//review>

< Review>
April 3, 2020, I Ordered two pizzas and one cheese stick on line, 1.5 hours before and requested it be ready at 6:15. They hadn't even started making it at 6:15. Couldn't find the order first. Then stated it was an internet glitch in communication. The orders from the internet were being sent to the bottom of their order list to make them. Person in charge, didnt want to make a phone call to find out why. I'm not the only one. Bad business.< /Review>

Never going back to this place . The pizza there is pretty good but way to expensive and they take forever to give you your order . Went there yesterday after i placed an order at 5:32pm. Had it set to pick up at 6:30pm
I got there and they didnt it have it ready . People would walk in after me and they would have there oizza ready. Ended up leaving there till 7:15pm.
There are better places in town anyways no need to go back.< /Review>

I appreciate the taste of the pizza there, but my dad got banned here after he reprimanded an employee that she didn't wash her hands. (My dad is very stupid by the way and he shouldn't have pointed that out...)<//Review>

<text>Every time I have visited this store I have had issues. Pizza is never ready when they say it is going to be (always have to wait 20+ minutes past when it says it will be ready), they have messed up pizzas before and say it will take another 20 minutes to make a new one, they forget to have the whole order together. I wouldn't recommend the store to anyone. I'm going to start driving to Rosedale and see if I get any better service<//text><Gmap_id>0x80ea6a91eafe7acd:0x6d9ba9785af38ee0</Gmap_id>< Resp>

<Review>Really bad experience the past 3 times out of 4 ordering from here.... The last or most recent time, I ordered 32$ of food and had 40$. I handed the money to the driver after the pizza was over a hour and 25 minutes past the 30 minutes it usually takes to deliver, but after I handed the guy the money, I ask for just 5$ back, he says NO, my boss didn't give me change... And runs to his car and leaves..   WOW... I WANT THIS FIXED, I call the manager on shift, he States the driver is mentally handicapped, and has him appologize, but there's nothing they can do to make this right, my neighbors cam outside because it's 10 at night and this guy's in his car on the phone screaming like a kid... And in all this is the second time they have forgot items in my order and keep telling me they will add them on the next order... SMH< /Review>< response>

I waited for a while and wasn’t impressed with the pizza, idk when I order a topping I expect to have a little bit on each slice not 3 mushrooms and several olives for the whole pizza. I might as well have ordered a cheese pizza</Review>

I have ordered pizza from this location before and now they told me they do not deliver to my home, were not helpful or even polite the person that was rude claimed to be the manager and they told me there radius of delivery is 4 miles when I am less than two miles away this only gets one star because I can only rate as low as one star I suggest you take your pizza craving to a better serving place< /Text>

They send a coupon in the mail and I am unable to place order online because I'm not in delivery range (2.9 miles away).  We call and they say they deliver up to 5 miles but then will not honor the coupon that they sent me in the mail.< /Review>

<review>Visit this place since my friend suggest it. I like the interior design! Have a really good combination of eastern style and modern style.
Food: dumpling is good! I like it, but the rest of the food is ok, not very outstanding, look not authentic Chinese food, too oily, plain flavor
Service: 4/5 not good not bad
The restroom is really disgusting!! Not one keep it clean, which I worried about the safety and hygiene of the kitchen.</review>< Pictures>

<review>My favorite restaurant of all time. Hands down. Food is never too overwhelming with sauces or spices. Everything is right for my taste buds. Recently, I went there and they had a special menu for supporting the LGBT youth community. I ordered from them many times and nothing had ever gone wrong. They also do a lot of themes and charity events, which are great!</review>< Pictures>

<date>1549858386748<//date><text>Not a place I would recommend for authentic Chinese food. The food is Chinese fusion. I think many people go to the restaurant because of Martin Yan's name.

The interior decor of the restaurant is unique. My favorite is the big antique bell at the bar. The seating, however, is very uncomfortable. The tables are placed too close to each other, with little room for people to walk through. The dishes look & sound creative, but the taste is really unimpressive.

For the price it charges, the customer service of this restaurant is disappointing! Most staff are courteous, but they don't know how to serve. When serving the soup, the usual Chinese etiquette is to pour the soup for all the guests at the table. But the server just put the soup and utensils on the table and left. Moreover, the Latino looking woman literally dropped the bowl of sauce in the middle of the table, and didn't even apologize for her rudeness.

Overall, the service and the food don't live up to M.Y. China's name.<//text>< gmap_id>

<text>Awesome spot!!! It is truly hard to go wrong with restaurants here in San Francisco. There are so many options to choose from, especially in this area and in the mall. Very pleased with the decision to follow the Chinese craving! This is a more upscale Chinese restaurant with a variety of rice, noodle, soup, meat dishes to choose from. We made the decision to eat here simply because of how good the food looked while walking by. Presentation of the dishes was very nice and the flavors were even better!! Service was average but the food made up for it. They have some of the best chicken wings I've ever had. Noodles were also delicious! If you are looking for a good meal while at the mall, I definitely recommend checking M.Y.

I loved watching Martin Yan’s cooking show as a kid. He really inspired me and started my journey in cooking and food. Really hope this place makes a great come back. Also their cocktails are awesome!<//text>

So good. Hand cut noodles, dim sum, Hong Kong crispy noodles, onion pancakes can't go wrong.<//review>

Tasty, but fairly overpriced. The Peking roast duck and wild boar noodles were the standouts. Wonton soup was pretty bland. Ambiance is a bit strange too, given that it’s crammed in a mall. If you feel like having upscale grub next to a bunch of consumer mall zombies this is your place.<//review>

<text>If you are looking for a place with authentic Chinese food, this is not your place. M.Y. China is more suited for people with a heavy taste, hence why many dishes at this restaurant are spicy. Service was a bit slow but servers were quite friendly. They do have quite a verity of tea unlike most Chinese restaurants where they only serve you one kind of tea. The deserts were quite good. Although the green tea tiramisu did not have much of a green tea flavor to it. Overall, this is an okay place. Great for people who love spicy food though.</text></record></dataset><record>

<Review>We waited briefly at noon on Sunday before we were seated. The dining area definitely started to get more packed while we were eating.
1) tea smoked pork belly sliders: good but there is no hint of tea flavor. The bao is soft and well steamed, but the pork belly is ordinary if not slightly bland.
2) Wild Boar Scissor Cut Noodles: the wild boar is diced into small indistinguishable pieces that it almost seemed like an afterthought in the dish. The noodles and sauce were unexpectedly commonplace in texture and flavor.
3) Dan Dan noodles: thin noodles are served cold in a peanut sauce. A lot of restaurants serve this differently, and this one is of the less notable versions.
4) Mushroom with spicy sesame sauce: the mushrooms have a great meaty texture, but one could not taste any sesame. The sauce instead bordered on the glossy sweet side.
5) eggplant and tofu clay pot: would definitely recommend for the soft tofu dredged in cornstarch and gently fried. The eggplant in the dish is cooked well
6) Yang zhou fried rice: delicious but very ordinary. Easily found and replicated by many restaurants.
7) Peking roast duck: the skin is crisp and well done. Also recommended.

M.Y. China is one of the better mall restaurants but certainly sits average among the category of americanized Cantonese food. While I will probably not return due to the conventional menu and flavors, I can definitely see it as a good alternative to the less exciting options at the mall.<//Review>< Pictures>

Pleasantly surprised by this place! My friend and I were starving and decided to just walk into this place. Wasn't sure what to expect but turned out to be pretty good! Walnut shrimp and eggplant hot pot is definitely worth trying!</Text>

Located in SFO downtown inside the mall this Restaurant has good ambiance, nice design, open kitchen and serving delicious and tasty food. Food is not oily and no strong taste which is really good. Good vegetarian options are available. Spicy chicken wings were my favourite.<//text>

Top dishes: pork juicy dumplings were incredible, the salt egg yolk crab was to die for, the basic sautéed bok choy and eggplant done to perfection.

The garlic lobster was a bit overrated and definitely not worth the price - definitely go for one of the crab dishes instead.

All in all, I’ll be back here many times again.</review>

<Text>Enjoyed Happy Hour here on a Friday evening. Dim sum was excellent. The tempeh buns were very tasty. Also tried the Chow Mein and it was delicious. Lots of gravy!

Drinks are pretty good during Happy Hour. Would definitely come back again!</Text>< pics>

Inside Westfield on 4 floor.
Came for dinner on a Tuesday night but wasn't to busy (was told due to coronva virus) still was busier than any other resturant.
Food was quite decent using fresh ingredients.
It's not a typical Chinese restaurant with most dishes having a spin on traditional dishes.
Overall it's worth a spot worth visiting.<//Review>

Food is so great here. Service is great too. The server guy offered me some hot sauce and my god that tasted really good. I love their spicy chicken wings and the juicy dumpling. Honey glazed walnut shrimp is something that you should give a try to. Also their matcha tiramisu and custard egg lava bun is amazing. Though new to chinese food, they totally took me offguard with their brilliant taste. It deserves more than 5 stars. Amazing.</review>

<text>It was pretty empty both times I’ve went. If you’re in the mall and want a sit down restaurant for Chinese food that isn’t fast food like the ones in the mall dining hall, this is the spot to go to.

Food isn’t too greasy and I can easily see a repeat visit in the future for a quick bite.</text>< pics>

I cant say enough about how much I love this place. Everything is made fresh, including (and especially) the noodles. The soups are flavorful and delicious, the entrees are elegant. But one of my favorite things here is the spicy crispy tofu...I could eat that all day long! My China is on the 4th floor of the Westfield mall, so if you're having a hard time finding it, take the elevator to the 4th floor (under the dome). There is sometimes a wait, but it's usually only 10-20 mins and it's worth it!<//text>

I always forget MY China when I choose where to eat in SF. But with the horrible air quality, we decided to stay inside Westfield Mall after getting off of BART. And I'm glad we did. Sadly we missed Happy Hour (Monday-Friday 3-6PM, mostly discounted alcoholic drinks).

I highly recommend the Da Dao "Big Knife" Seafood Noodle - stir-fried noodle with generous portion of seafood (scallop, squid, shrimp), shiitake mushroom (my fav), baby oyster mushroom, pea sprouts and stringy egg. Such good work flavor! It was good to eat with other saltier dish as it was a bit bland, so I asked for some chili sauce and that definitely elevated the dish. Must-try! Eggplant tofu clay pot had pieces of soft, lightly fried tofu with chunks of eggplant. It was a soy sauce-based dish, and had some basil for flavoring; a little oily though.

Overall, great American Chinese food! But of course it was more expensive than your usual Chinese restaurant. Also they make interesting cocktaiIs. If you are a drinker, try to make it to Happy Hour.<//Review>

First of all...A-MAZ-ING experience at M.Y. China tonight.

Not knowing when I’d be here again, we ordered a bunch of dishes, and it was worth every single penny, and honestly then some.

Honey Glazed BBQ Pork, great.
Juicy Pork Dumplings, absolutely yes.
Chairman Mow’s Spicy Chicken, amazing.
American Wagyu Medallions, get.out.of.town.</Review>

Underwhelming, but not bad food. The price point seems to be okay for “elevated” dim sum, definitely cheaper than Yank Sing. We ordered pot stickers, XLB, a cold noodle dish, crispy pork buns, and lava egg buns. Would probably only order XLB again but what is unusual about them, they serve them in spoons with a cucumber under the dumpling. It was a bit strange to me.<//review>

I wouldn't go back.

First , service was super slow and did-engaged.  We sat and waited a lot and had to ask for help.  Took 20 minutes after we were seated to get our water and first drink.  And that was after asking for it twice.

Food is hit or miss.  But sweet and sour pork was super chewy.  My beef noodle soup, the beef was excellent, but the broth was meh'

Seating can be really really tight.  We pretty much had dinner with the people next to us.

For the price , and location, I would definitely recommend going somewhere else.</review>

Shopping in Westfield mall and ran across MY China, tantalizing aromas wafted through the air and drew us in for a quick bite. Lots of seating both inside and out. Ordered the hot and sour soup and pork dumplings. Prompt service and very tasty food.<//Text>

<review>Good food , ambience and customer service. If you like spicy food, Organic tofu was one of a kind with garlicky crunch.Small portions, though.<//review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNdWlKsqUpw_cM4zZNqxQztou3HUYXlX5OO1W1k=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOqQ4WS3PNC4sYT0YqXD7X_N0B07JoSJb6Vs2fu=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMsCfDzgdhTZtAJperQcMUyPM9wrF-ekc4P4bZG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPQXCmcKxW8szMahumMIeA3JvS5lThj-9VbIYxC=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNzoq3qS9ZPbVTyg1U_futa66sO0MGDzfaXAKSU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOHxawg8zuPiQO-FmUV6A89-qMyN8NMAgbT4v_a=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNv389wuS8QgY24jtsAJLsGmysodzjC8NxD9WFA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPpFacMdY26FvcFKudm3fZT5ibYeQDNgVwp1uwB=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMwx4IY5NsxYNymGua_9TMs61sRp2Dyw0fgD3m5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures>< Resp>

Actually wasn't planning on eating in the mall. Too busy, too touristy. We remembered we hadn't been to this spot and decided to come to M.Y. China. Sat at the bar and ordered Bang Bang Chicken Wings and Da Dao Noodles, amazing! We also had a Trio Juicy Dumplings, yes please!! To drink we had several, but I would recommend the Sunset at Eight for something sweet and the Moon on Bloom if you want something "spirit forward". Must go!!<//Review>

Mediocre. Slightly shameful. Very Western flavors. Hodge podge assortment of toppings on every dish. Don't waste your time and money.<//review>

Went here for lunch after a recommendation from a friend, and it was pretty decent. I had the Wonton Soup and Wild Boar Lettuce Cups. Both items were nice, but not that filling. Guess it was my fault for picking something small, but I was also trying to eat healthy, and everything on the menu seemed so high in calories!
One of my friends had the Kung Pao Chicken and the other had a vegetarian item, and both said their food was amazing, and filling too.< /text>

Best happy hour downtown as far as I’m concerned. It’s 3-6 during the week, drinks $7 and small plates $6. The choices are limited but what you get is amazing. Bang bang chicken wings are the bomb and I don’t even like chicken wings. Ditto for the spring rolls. Go!!!< /review>

Hiding in a shopping mall, M.. China was an amazing find.  As you as you get there, you know you've made a great decision as it smells fantastic.  It is very clean and contemporary.  The menu offers classics and riffs on classic,  if you want to try something new, for example taco appetizers where the flavors were all Chinese but the delivery a surprise. Most amazing mall food I've ever had.< /text>

Located in the shopping mall. The jasmine Collins was quite good, although personally I would add more of jasmine instead of citrus notes. The dumpling wrappers were delicate and thin with generous amount of fillings. The egg custard lava Bao was absolutely the star of the show: gooey, warm, sweet, silky smooth egg custard paired perfectly with the dough. The Bao dough is very good: fluffy, soft, like a cloud.
For de desserts. Tea infused crème brûlée was okay, not very strong tea flavor. Vietnamese coffee ice cream was neither strong or creamy. It was watery, sugary sweet with not that much of coffee flavor.

Overall, good place but a bit overpriced for Chinese food.<//text>

I went there since the first day they opened. The twin scallops fried rice always my favorite. And cocktail East Meets West that a tea based cocktail taste fresh and great. It actually changed. When I order those sea food dishes were always got more than now at the same price. But still worth it since they use the fresh food materials.</Review>

We have eaten here many times over the years, and the quality is always excellent.  We eat here at least once every time we visit SF (We don't have quality Chinese food where we live).  Our favorite dishes?  Chairman Mao's Chicken, Scissor cut noodles, the Pork juicy dumplings and the Sichuan Green beans are some of our favorites.  We tried the Honey Walnut shrimp this time and it was excellent as well.  We will return!!!</Review>

Let me just say that this place lives up to the hype! Definitely make a reservation or else you're going to be stuck in the crowd waiting for a while. The to-go pickup section also got pretty long but they move quick.M.Y. China<//review>

At the suggestion of a concierge, we ordered from MY CHINA. First, they delivered only part of the order. They ran out of one of the dishes and never called to ask us if we wanted another option. So, they delivered Szechuan green beans which were quite spicy. They also delivered General Mao’s chicken which was described in their menu as “crispy with Sweet and Sour sauce. In fact, it was so spicy that it was inedible. So disappointed. We’ll tell the concierge not to recommend this spot again</text>

Mysterious vibes in the restaurant, the lighting is dark. Good for parties, friends meet ups. The  waiters were decent friendly. Noted here, the dandan noodles are served cold with sliced carrots on top which is different from originals and its not so meaty, but still worth a try. The crab dumpling was placed over a pice of veggie, server with a kind of red sweet/sour liquidish sauce, the dumplings were juicy as you would expected but fairy decent taste. Would recommend it if you wanna have dumplings once a while. Also connivence location, its located on the top floor of westfield. Right next to the elevator, easy to found. Different from the open fast restaurants on the F1, it is actually a well-decorated American Chinese restaurant.<//Text>

Our first encounter was the maitre'd who rudely told us WE WERE LATE. What a greeting and welcome to the restaurant. Not appropriate for any restaurant to tell it's customers. She needed lessons in hospitality. Food and waiter service was excellent. Thank you for that.<//Review>

This is from a regular or used to be a regular MY customer. Went back last night after several months and sat at the bar as usual; same crew but they don’t remember us.

We ordered the regular (menu had not changed), food volume has shrank tremendously together with our regular martini. Although the martini glass is the same, how pathetic since martini can always be watered down.

This will definitely help cover the rent but losing regular customers like us at the same time.  Cheers.<//text>

Mr Yan greeted us at the bar last night and took time to chat about the food, the giant bell and how he got it from a rural temple in China, his amazing energy levels and great blood pressure numbers!

His enthusiasm about the food is infectious and the food self was very good as always. There is a great variety and a great amount of creativity in the offerings and we always have a wonderful meal there.< /review>

Got a table after 30 mins. Delicious food - tried various types of noodles from different regions - the closest I could get to Chongqing noodles was Dan Dan noodles served cold. They came not very spicy so I added in chili oil. Martin Yang came by our table and talked with us and ok it the different regions and encouraged my boy friend to try the chili oil. Overall good restaurant, food and drinks! Very cool to meet the Martin Yang!</text>

Ambiance is pretty nice, having the dome be part of the environment adds quite a bit to the meal. Service is quick and very attentive. Meal is largely Chinese, less Americanized than the usual fare. The price is quite high for the quantity.<//Review>

We ordered two dishes salted egg crab and wild pork cut noodle. Crab weighs 2-2.5lb. It is enough for two people sharing. Salted egg is a amazing ingredient. It can promote the taste of other ingredients. The noodle is not slender one，it is short and wide. The taste is not bad. But I cannot tell the difference of the wild pork. It is just like the normal pork. Depends on that，it is a little pricey.< /review>

<Review>This is a hidden gem for me. I found this place by chance last fall while attending a conference at the Moscone Center and had to come back while at this years conference.
The staff is friendly and helpful, the food is pretty good for 'mall food'. They have a pretty big menu and the atmosphere is great.
I highly recommend trying it at least once. You won't be disappointed.< /Review>< Pics>

Great as always!! Food / drinks / appetizers and SERVICE. Sorry I was not able to get the name of our "happy hour" waiter. First time I saw him. He's good / gladly attends "with a smile" to the customers' needs -- a real asset to MY China.</Review>

Came here from a high recommendation to show my family the art of pulling noodles. The chef was done pulling for the day, but fulfilled my request and made my daughter and very happy girl. It was nothing short of an incredible show. We sat at the noodle bar and watched them create many beautiful dishes. Our food was nothing short of spectacular. My 10 year old trying wild boar, pork belly and many incredible dishes. I ordered a number of small dishes to try and not one disappointed. And the Service? INCREDIBLE! A must visit destination.<//text>

The food here was very tasty and the service very friendly. We were here on a Saturday evening and it was super busy.  Yet they found a place for us so that we could eat. The flavors are perfect and the food is well finished. Highly recommended if you are in San Francisco and like to eat Asian food.<//Review>

This is a Chinese restaurant inside the Westfield mall under the iconic windowed dome over the former Emporium Capwell department store.  Service was good.  Portions were good.  The food was delicious.< /review>

<review>I've been here a couple of times and in general I like the food a lot. It's in a fun location, which might make it feel a bit commercial, but I enjoy coming here to eat.

The food itself is generally pretty good. Can't go wrong with the dumplings, my favorites being the pork juicy dumplings or the BBQ pork bao. You can always do yourself a favor and get the Dim Sum collection which gives you a sample of the dumplings.

The beef noodle soup is also a treat. The one item I had that I wasn't terribly impressed with was the honey walnut shrimp, which came out a bit cold. Either way, looking forward to my next visit already.</review>< pictures>

<Text>Good Chinese food. It’s located inside the mall and it’s a bit confusing to find. It’s on the 4th floor. We found our way by going through Bloomingdale’s and then walking into the common mall area. Lots of choices. We had the steamed dumplings. Quite tasty. We also had the boar lettuce wraps / tacos. Tasty as well. I ordered the roasted duck. They did a great job. Normally duck is quite greasy and messy. This duck was hands down one of the best I have had in a Chinese place. It was cooked perfectly and seasoned well. I would definitely recommend this place for a nice meal. Pricing was on par for the quality.<//Text></record>

This place is amazing. Yummy wings. All the wings are great. My favorite are the hot garlic and then the dry fried and then the salt and pepper, but everything is tasty. So glad there's a yummy Chinese food place in Haight.</Review>

<Review>Martin yang used to have a TV show on Channel 9 Public Access television she has in a blessing to San Francisco in the entire Bay Area he's so funny and the food he makes it easy for you to understand how to make it at home a lot of the recipes come from his mother he keeps a small black book with all the recipe ingredients we visited him many years ago when he had his TV show and someone misplaced his book, that show is the funniest show I've ever seen. They found the black book hear me crazy without it he's older now this must have been twenty years ago or maybe more, at any rate he's a great guy and the food he produces is wonderful he now has a restaurant in the San Francisco Centre called my China . I personally like the scissor cut noodles they make them right in front of you and serve them to you fresh it's a wonderful place and the Dome outside is stunning</Review><date>1545277939674<//date>< user_name>

I'm sorry it's in a mall and not down a picturesque alley in Chinatown, but it's simply better than almost any Chinese place in town. If you like fresh, high end, not too adventurous, but thorough tasty Chinese food. I say this not because the food is better than any number of places I could name, but because the overall experience makes this a civilized, clean experience, with a great bar, big pretty well appointed room, and a solid go-to place. (And p.s., my favorite Chinese place---well one of them is a Szechuan place out Clement Street, and it's absolutely filthy. Same with the other place I could name on Kearny in Chinatown, a gross disgusting mess with a waitress who always has on the same unlaundered seat shirt each time I go. Food is divine at both places, but honestly, I don't want to have to deal with those places most of the time.)<//text>

Loved everything about this place from the super friendly family orientated atmosphere to the scrumptious and flavorful cuisine. The female host was SO sweet that she taught my niece mandarin and made sure we were well taken care of. Also this place is very vegetarian friendly. This will now be our go-to Chinese restaurant!< /Review>

Some of the best Chinese food I've eaten. Very high quality ingredients and slightly elevated without messing with the major components of the traditional recipes. I could eat here a few days a week and not get bored.</Review>

<text>I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS RESTAURANT TO EVERYONE WHETHER YOU ARE CHINESE OR NOT.
The chef should be Chinese. He knows our tradition that eat carbs in fall. In addition, this restaurant make great Guangdong dishes. The seasonal special make me feel the rich guangdong style. This is a good example of high end Chinese restaurant. They insist on making traditional Chinese dishes and carefully choose best one that suit for the taste of both Chinese and all other people in US. This is a place not only make Chinese feel like home, but also a window make others to know the how delicious and subtle Chinese dishs can be.</text><user_name>william zeng</user_name>< Pics>

I’ve been there twice as it is across the street from my hotel. The positive stuff first. If you are a fan of Peking duck, they do it very well and it’s reasonably priced. One half portion is plenty for two people ($24). I’ve also had the house fried rice which was good but not that special for $13 (a small portion) and any decent Chinese restaurant can do it the same and even better. Now the negative. Two extremely disappointing items were the dumpling sampler ($15 for 6) and the salt and pepper calamari. The dumplings were bland and absolutely tasteless - all 3 flavors were blech. The calamari was like eating a breaded car tire, thick breading and tough/chewy. They were equally wretched ... and I don’t get to use that word often. We were planning to order one of the Market priced lobster dishes, but at $60+ it wasn’t worth the risk when two very simple dishes were disappointments. As this seems to be a mid to higher end priced restaurant, I expected better quality for the price. I will say the wait staff is nice and somewhat attentive, but overall it was a thumbs down for us and I gave it two chances. Venture down Geary St for much better quality, variety AND value. Peking Duck and service makes it 3 stars for me.< /Text>

<rating>5<//rating><Review>I love this place. Its located on the 4th floor of Westfield Mall. The best way to get there is to enter on Mission and take the elevators to teh 4th floor. Just walk through Bloomingdale. There is parking across the street at the Fifth and Mission Garage. Location wise its stunning, right under the dome. They have a variety of really fancy dishes that are almost magical.<//Review>< pictures>

<review>I was excited to try M.Y. China as it was a cold and rainy day in the city and I was really looking forward to some excellent Chinese cuisine. That said, I was really disappointed in M.Y. China. I was excited to see that many dishes could be made gluten-free and after learning that the Beef Noodle Soup could not be made gluten-free, the waiter suggested the Venison Chow Mein which I enthusiastically said yes to, having never tasted Venison. Unfortunately when the dish arrived, it came with about 5 pieces of Venison and a large amount of uninspiring noodles and bean sprouts. The Venison was good, but the rest of the dish was lackluster. I will say that the service was good; the house manager came over to make sure I had been greeted and given a menu and I was able to cool my heels there for over an hour without feeling pressured to leave. I just wish the food had been more exciting.<//review>< pics>

<text>This restaurant is located in the mall and it's a good option for an upscale meal. I went with my coworkers and we really enjoyed it. We started with some dumplings and liked the pork and crab and the pork and truffle. The knife cut noodles were tasty and had a great chewy consistency. Another favorite was the 5 spice pork ribs. They meat was tender and flavorful and the ribs were lightly fried.< /text>< rating>

Wow, what a fantastic meal!  Garlic crab and lobster... superb!  All dimsums, yummy & HOT!!  Beef and rock fish dishes, wow, so delicious.  Beef noodle dish, we wanted to order another one but we had enough food.  Unbelievable flavors and so clean.  Waiter was knowledgeable with the menu.  Super nice staff. I would come here again when we visit San Francisco next time.  Yan can cook!  Loved it!! So full!!  We're  going to live very long lives since we ate super long noodles.  Awesome meal!< /review>

Worth a visit. The food was very good and the waitress was really helpful when advising about the menu.
The portions are such that i would suggest sharing dishes.

My brother had made the reservations in advance several days earlier.  However, when one of our sisters arrived first, the tables were not grouped together, and the wait staff refused to move them together.

As a result, our party was broken into three parts, alienating one group to a round table away from everyone.

Food was okay with small portions with large prices [though the Black Ink Noodle did was the only outstanding dish, but at a high price].  It was a challenge to order more dishes as the waiter, though good, was stretched thin as he was the only one authorized to submit an order.  This took awhile since he did not make regular visits as he had four other tables to cover, and the other support staff were useless as they told us to order through him, which took as long as 20 minutes just to order!

This was even more frustrating since the dining room was half empty.

Probably better to head to Chinatown and get real Chinese food at real prices.</text>< Pictures>

<Review>I think that me and my family just found our favorite Chinese restaurant!
Very friendly greeter and server made the experience pleasant.
You can see into the kitchen and watch the cooks working(always a good sign)
The food was really tasty. I have not come across a Chinese restaurant that has a taste that you can savor.
The food is noticeably fresh and high quality unlike many restaurants (Chinese or otherwise).
I always enjoyed watching Martin Yan on TV and think that he has a passion for Chinese food and cooking and you can tell that this pride and friendly demeanor translates into his restaurant. Good Job Martin! I highly recommend this restaurant.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

Surprisingly good experience here. There can be a wait, so I recommend just reserving through OpenTable since they put priority on those with reservations (they allow same day).

If you are craving legitimate Chinese food after some shopping but are too lazy to make it to the Richmond or Chinatown, just go here!

We got the string beans, Peking duck (half), and beef noodle soup. The beef noodle soup was very good, I actually don't know where else to get this dish since sf is so lacking of authentic Taiwanese food. The Peking duck was great as well, though I wish they provided the thin pancake slices to eat with instead of the steamed buns. The string beans were pretty standard and nothing special.

The service was also really great - despite us having a seat more towards the outdoor area, our waitress Jessica was super attentive.

We are glad to have a good Peking duck option in sf, without having to trek to Berkeley.  I wouldn't mind coming back again.</Text>

<review>Pretty mediocre food. The whole wheat dumplings were good. But nothing to write home about. The crispy Hong Kong style chicken was dry and flavorless. The powdery stuff on the side didn't do much for it. The chili oil helped make it palatable.  $2 for brown rice is pricey<//review>< pictures>

There are a few changes that I would love to see. First, the servers are so busy that you don't really get good customer service, it's almost like fast food service.

Also, When checking out this place, the website said that they teach you about how to prepare the food, but they don't. which is really wack.</review>

<Review>Good quality, clean Chinese food. The bok choy with cured fish and knife cut noodles with wild boar are delicious. Prices are higher than your average Chinese restaurant, but it's worth the ambience and quality. Good place to take folks to dinner.< /Review>< Date>

Refined Chinese cuisine. I would never expect a mall restaurant would serve foods this elegant. A surprising and delightful experience that changed my view after my first visit to Martin Yan's M.Y. China. It's not P.F. Chang's. When there is only one, but not thousands of franchise location, you know they will not go midway, since M.Y. China doesn't need to. They serve dishes that heavy with the authenticity but elevated with originality.< /Review>

<Review>MUST SIT AND WATCH THEM HAND PULL NOODLES!!  The kitchen is certainly a show kitchen. You can see what Chef has recently carved out of Veggies and watch them cook the amazing food!!  The variety of hand pulled noodles are incredible.  They taste amazing as well!  Don't forget the sugar puffs for dessert!  Chef will even walk the restaurant pulling noodles so all can see!< /Review><user>113809138717931434941</user><user_name>Christy Vaca</user_name><pics>None< /pics>< response>

<Date>1562906969455< /Date><user_name>Harry Yang</user_name><review>Essentially a fancier PF Chang’s that’s a bit more on the authentic side.

Pros: nice environment, good service, a big variety of Americanized as well as classic Chinese dishes

Con: very overpriced and the portions were small. Americanized dishes were just fancy Panda Express/P.F. Chang’s, the authentic dishes were ok or worse (some were flavorless, others were dry, etc) and can be found made better in real Chinese restaurants.

Consider going to Fang as an alternative if you haven’t tried it yet< /review></record>

<review>The whole experience was just awesome.  The location at Westfield Shopping Center is super easy to get to.  We started with whole wheat pot stickers with their spicy sauce was great.  We had Dan Dan Noodles, Wok Seared Beef, Beef Hand Pulled Noodles.  For desert we had the Egg Puffs and Ginger Mousse Chocolate Cake.  This was just a great meal with great service.  Would recommend to everyone.</review>< Pics>

M.Y. China was one of the restaurants I've walked by so many times when walking around Westfield. It never really caught my eye until I ate here. I hear the counter is the best place to sit so you can watch them prepare your food and toss the noodles around, but we usually sit outside the restaurant and watch others walk around the mall. The service is usually on-point and timely. I appreciate their tea selection. The food is also really tasty. It can be a little expensive due to it's location, but I usually find it's worth it. Don't make the mistake like I did, stop in next time you're in Westfield.</review>

I could eat them every day of my life for breakie, lunch and dinner and be utterly blown away by every bite. The noodles are a must!! The chef received an award for his noodles recently - they are magnificent. Beijing Knife Cut Noodles are so flavorful with the mushroom combination, a little kick of spice and delicious pork. Bring groups of friends, family or business here for a taste of China that  is unlike anything in San Francisco.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None< /resp><gmapID>0x808580860ca8f4fb:0x170fd44206b9ead1<//gmapID></record>

<Review>The food and service was pleasantly good, I ordered Brasied Tofu garnished with Jalapeño, along with Jasmine Rice, Vegetable Spring Rolls and Spinach noodles soup with 5 types of mushrooms.
The food taste was the closest I have experienced since visiting Mainland China, the quality of the ingredients stood out the most. The Tofu was Crisp and a delight to eat, Spring rolls were extra hot and I loved them as they were not drenched in oil, the soup was a 8 out of 10 just because it was a veggie so it was missing the taste pork would typically add, understandably I had ordered a Vegan Soup!
The price was the real surprise the whole thing was $43.00 which included $11.00 in beverages alone. The service super quick and pleasant, really I’d like to give them 6 Stars. Highly Recommend this place.< /Review>< Pics>

We visited this restaurant twice in one week.  On a weekday, the service was OK, but absolutely terrible on a Saturday night.  At first, we were told it was a 20 minute wait for a table, after 30 minutes of waiting we were told it would be another 15 minutes!  Then all of a sudden, we were able to be seated straight away. Once we were sat down it took about 15 minutes for someone to take our drink order and another 15 for us to actually get our drinks.  Food is great though and worth the wait.</Review>

<review>Gotta start off by saying that we were served by perhaps the best waitress I have ever experienced. She was spot on with timing, suggestions, encouragement, and just the right amount of humor. Type of server I imagine at a much more expensive place that this. Food was really good. We picked out a few items and then our server filled in the blanks to get an awesome family-style meal. Pork tacos and the king pao chicken really stuck out as did the walnut shrimp. Decor wasn't really inviting, but the food and service was so good, I barely noticed.< /review>< Pics>

Five stars plus! Dad's 100th birthday party could not have been more yummy, 11 courses with attentive and well paced service. Highly recommend for a special occasion!
Craig Berold, the GM is is a pleasure to work with and he, with Chef Wu, created a perfect banquet menu. Consider this venue for a special occasion or just to drop in if you're in San Francisco.<//review>

This place is pricey but many of the quality of the food and the ambiance make it worth it for the most part. I went for lunch on a Friday. The shiu mai was delicious, but at $8 overpriced in my opinion. The Hong Kong crispy noodles were came with generous portions of chicken and bok choy. The noodles were crisp and the accompanying sauce was gooey but not overpowering. The wok seared beef had tender and delicious beef chunks, although the sauce was a bit too salty for my liking.<//review>

< Review>
One waitress cheated on the tip! My bill was $30.65, the printed tip of 20% on the bill was $10.86 which was actually more than 35%.  I am always generous on tips so I just blindly paid that number.  I just realized this cheating trick after I was back home but I didn't keep my bill.
Double check all the numbers on the bill before you pay it and keep the bill.< /Review>

Whole wheat potstickers are not to miss. The wild board dumplings were intriguing but a little bland though fresh. Great attention to design in restaurant. The pear salad was super flavorful. The service was friendly and attentive but they mixed up our orders, forgot a dish, and did the same for the table next to us. That being said, a host came by and served us for a bit and was very gregarious and one of the chefs came out and did a little dough twirling. The food was great and we will definitely be coming back</Review>

Fantastic setting, quiet place where you can enjoy delicious chinese food. The salad with crispy chicken shall not be missed! Recommended to anyone, those who want to enjoy a meal in peace and those who are in a hurry. The kitchen is visible to anyone and clients can appreciate the way the meals are prepared.<//Text>

<Text>The food was the savior for this place. The service was slow. It took the two of us over 25 minutes to just get water and we had to remind the waitress. We also had a green onion allergy and told them before hand and they still put green onions on the food. Pork was a tad chewy but the flavors were on point with all of our dishes. The dan dan noodles are what is pictured and was very flavorful.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

Four stars for happy hour.  Good shrimp dumplings (ha gow) and pork dumplings (siu mai) for $5 a dish. Tea house prices but in the evening and with alcohol! Two of my favorite things combined. Calamari and potstickers also  tasty. Would skip the riblets the next time bc they are too hard to eat.

Food pretty good overall but non-happy hour is too expensive (although the nicer atmosphere can be nice sometimes).</review>

<Response>None</Response><Review>We started with the best Green Onion Pancake we'd ever had: thin, hot, crispy, and flaky like a fine pastry. (We later ordered another and it was slightly doughy, but not as bad as most other versions of this dish.) Other hits: Spicy Seafood Dumplings, Black Sesame Ice Cream, Tea Infused Creme Brulee. The Tea Smoked Pork Belly Sliders were merely good.

We also liked the cocktails, including the Monkey Prince and one whose name I can't remember that had Baijiu and vanilla bitters.< /Review><pics>None< /pics><user_name>Tom O'Neill</user_name>< rate>

Nice ambiance.
Complimentary sparking or still water.
Overly priced dim sum or dishes with veggies that are presented Chinatown style.
Expect to eat small portions but pay $$$ for it.
Overall, you are paying for their rent by having small portion of food.< /review>

<review>Wonderfully delicious dinner!  I ate here with a group of about 15 friends last night, sharing many dishes, and was surprised and delighted that I loved *everything*!  Great flavors, texture, meat quality, etc.  And very attentive service!  Our water glasses were refilled frequently, the table was wiped and cleared several times, and so on.

Also, the owner, Martin Yan, came by our table to say hi, sporting a big friendly grin.  You can tell he's truly in love with making people happy with food :).

My only quibble was that the seating was a bit uncomfortable (I was pretty squished up against the guy sitting at the table next to me) and a couple of us kept getting dripped on by a condensed pipe above our heads :\.  But this situation might have been due to us trying to squeeze way too many people into a single long table and likely doesn't reflect the normal seating situation.

I look forward to returning and trying more from the super-tasty and well-executed menu!</review><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None<//Resp><GmapID>0x808580860ca8f4fb:0x170fd44206b9ead1< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Took about 40 minutes to bring our food, the food was terrible, dry, sticky, and no flavor. Love Chinese food but this was not the best at all. The service is poor. Never coming back plus the food is extremely expensive.<//Text>

The lamb chops with honey glaze was scrumptuous.

The dumpling soup was delicious.

Service was first class.

The ginormous bell in the middle of the bar was like a salvaged antique from China</Review>

Actually, it didn't even deserve a single star. The food was mediocre and the service was too slow. PLUS we ordered one dish but they forgot to cook it!

Will absolutely NOT recommend this restaurant to anyone!!!!<//text>

My parents have been watching Martin Yan's cooking shows all the time. And in August 2013, when I heard that this restaurant is coming,  I checked on YouTube for info. I can't wait to try the scissor cut noodles!</review>

The scissor cut wild boar noodles are freshly made and very,very  tasty.  I got to watch one of the chef's make the handmade noodles.  The shiu mai and the shrimp and avocado fresh rolls were equally delicious and get high marks for presentation.  This is a wonderful place to go for fine dim sum dining and fresh, well-prepared noodles.  I'll definitely be back to try beef hand pulled noodles next time.<//text>

<text>IF YOU HAVE FOOD ALLERGIES AVOID THIS PLACE!!!!!

TLDR: of the 2 dishes I ordered, they screwed up 4 times and would have given me a severe allergic reaction!

I went to My China on Wed evening with my CEO and several of his friends. I explained my food allergies of peppers, cayenne, chili powder and anything "spicy" to the waitress and was advised I could eat the fried chicken appetizer, rice and sweet and sour chicken.

The waitress brought the fried chicken wings and it was immediately obvious that it was covered in cayenne or chili powder with peppers on top of it. All of which I am very allergic to. The waitress apologized and promised that she would make sure it didn't happen again.

She brought out the order and promised it was fine as she had personally talked to the head chef and he was extra careful. I almost took a bite when my dining companions told me to stop because it had a ton of straight cayenne on it.

I waited for 5 minutes and went to find a manager, I spoke with another waitress who said she was on break and would come see me shortly and took the wings for a second time.

Our waitress came back apologizing again, and I reiterated my food allergies and that this was serious. She promised to make sure there was no more problems. She delivered the wings shortly after and the 3rd time, no spice, just incredibly over cooked. I assume the chef wasn't happy.

I hadn't received my main dish at this point while the others had been out for awhile. When it came, it was covered in peppers and appeared to have chili flake as well. The table tried it and reported it was spicy. At this point people were finishing up their meals and I was very embarrassed.  The group insisted on waiting until I had my dinner and ended up sitting there for 30 minutes until my food came and I finished it as fast as I could.

This whole experience was very embarrassing and is simply inexcusable.

P.S. The manager never came to talk to me.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Name>

Their garlic baby bok choy is really good as well.

Those are the menus that I always go for. Their tea is pretty good too, for Jasmine one. Although the milk oolong isn't as great though, it's not "milky" enough. I mentioned this mainly because I have tried a really good milk oolong, so I guess I'm just comparing it with this.

One thing that I'm missing is that I used to make a reservation through OpenTable, and now they are no longer offer it from there. Have to reserve from Yelp instead.</Text><pics>None<//pics><Response>None< /Response><gmapID>0x808580860ca8f4fb:0x170fd44206b9ead1< /gmapID></record>

Being a S.F. Native, great Chinese food is normal to me. Then there was PF Chang's, call style Chinese ....I worked there for a year, its good. Then I ate at this new spot at a casino near by. OMG  the wild boar noodles and steam dumplings "BEST FOOD EVER"
I am reviewing my parents night out I picked them up after. MAKE IT A MUST  If you are visiting The City . Uber or BART/MUNI is easiest way to restaurant. If you have to drive 5th street garage on Mission and 5th street, safest and easy parking location.</Review>

<text>Really not bad. Service was pretty decent. While it doesn't taste exactly like how I know it would taste, it comes quite close to the sweet and light cantonese fare I love. Pricing isn't too bad, only thing I don't recommend is the xiaolongbao. It isn't worth it though the flavor is decent. It was a pain to get out of the spoons and wasn't done the way it should be. Make the trip to din tai fung if you can.</text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

< Review>
After hearing Martin Yan had opened a restaurant and since I had just moved to SF, it was perfect timing. I loved watching Yan Can Cook as a child and I was excited to have the opportunity to see what his restaurant had to offer.

The wild boar scissor cut noodles are a must try. They are so flavorful and have that nice "wok" flavor to them. It can be a bit salty to some palates but it goes well with the entrees. The Beijing knife cut noodles are also worth trying. They are cooked well and are a nice vegetarian option. The beef hand pulled noodles are also good. The presentation is very neat and the broth is quite tasty. But I would recommend trying the dry noodles to the noodle soups are you can taste more of the "wok" flavor and it's much easier to share. Also, the chefs sometimes put on a show as they pull the noodles right in front of your table.

My favorite entree has to be the five spice pork ribs. Don't let the word ribs deceive you into the dish being messy and hard to eat because it's quite the opposite. The meat was so tender and fell right off the bone. The pork ribs I presume is slow cooked and then fried a bit on the outside to give it that crispy golden color and taste. It's so delicious that you must try for yourself. The lamb chops are also on the top of my list. It's seasoned with cumin and chili powder and tastes so flavorful and juicy. Also, you can give the Peking duck a try. It's not the best Peking duck but it is still good and satisfies the craving.

From the small eats, the tea smoked pork belly sliders are wonderful. They are tender and goes nicely with the bun. But I have to say I've had better as the pork belly wasn't melt in your mouth.

I've made three visits here already and have loved the food and experience here each time. It's situated right under the dome at the Westfield and it's a perfect place to grab dinner and a movie. I love this place and of course I'm planning future visits.<//Review>

<review>We had a good dinner here, but considering the price and general atmosphere something made me expect a little more than good. We had the pork dumplings which were fairly flavorful, but nothing special (and hard to eat). The tempeh sliders had a nice steamed bun and a good sauce, but a piece of romaine lettuce seemed unnecessary and there wasn’t enough sauce. The hand cut noodles with wild boar were very tasty and I liked the noodle texture, definitely a little different. Flavorful, although not particularly unique flavor and it could have been any meat really since it was small pieces. I would have like more mushroom too. The green tea tiramisu was fantastic though, I really liked the texture and there was a strong tea flavor that I really liked. Im not sure I’d go back, but good service and really an overall good meal means it’s worth a stop and certainly you’re likely to have a good meal, just don’t expect something incredibly new or different.</review><rate>4<//rate>< time>

A bit o the pricey side, but M.Y. China is known for their noodles. Skip the side of fried rice and get Da Dao Big Knife Fish Noodles. Excellent flavor and they don't skimp on the seafood! The beef rolls were also good! The fried rice was bland and paled in comparison to everything else.<//review>

It is in the Westfield San Francisco Central Mall. A friend highly recommended the restaurant. The environment is nice and the waiters are so kind. We ordered Da Dao "big knife" fish noodles, Sichuan Green beans, wok(beef, tofu and eggplant). Really delicious. You should have a try.<//text>

Surprisingly good restaurant for a shopping mall. I really like the wild boar scissor cut noodles, the spicy seafood dumplings and the Kung Pao chicken. They make good cocktails as well; I like the Nixon Visit (vodka, allspice, cucumber & agave).</review>

It's a really nice spot for a mall. Now we have three options at the Westfiled Center for a good meal and ambience. I really like the way the new-asian influence is reflected throughout the decor, with a great open bar, awesome staff and tasty cocktails. Try the MaiTai, it was really well done. We ordered appetizers and they all were super good, perfect setting for happy hour or even a quick meal before going to the movies. Great selection of drinks, food and overall a nice experience. Would come back again.<//review>

Surprisingly genuine fare and the service was impossible to complain about. We can recommend the Kung Pao chicken, the wild boar with scissor cut noodles and the non-alcoholic cocktail menu. The prices were a little too steep considering the venue and the food, but that's just a side note. Our visit was still completely satisfying.<//review>

<Text>Yes, it's in the mall but despite that, M.Y. China serves up some pretty tasty Chinese food. They've got the standard kung pao and honey walnut shrimp that are now cornerstones in most American Chinese restaurants but things like their pork dumplings (xiao long bao) and lots of their noodles are definitely on point and delicious. Very extensive menu, nice airy interior. I'd say it's a little bit more upscale too, some of the fish and seafood entrees are pushing $40 but a good meal can definitely be had for less than that.< /Text>< Pictures>

<Rating>5</Rating><review>At this elegant establishment, Chinese cuisine is elevated to a previously unimaginable level. How? It's Martin Yan's place. 'Nuff said. MUST try: wild boar lettuce cups, whole wheat potstickers, slow cooked beef & hand pulled noodles, pork & black truffle dumplings. Make reservations in advance, or risk getting buried in the throng of people waiting for a seat. This addictive restaurant can get hectic and the wait long. Great for groups or dates, though the noise level can become a hinderance to private conversations. Try to get seated at a booth if you can.< /review><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< GmapID>

I glanced in the kitchen as we were being seated and swore I saw one guy skipping rope while another was snipping a softball with scissors. The things these restaurants do these days to be different.... Turns out this is how they make the noodles. Lots of twirling in the air and snipping noodles from a ball of dough.

We ordered:
crispy springrolls - nothing special here
stir fly baby bok choy - garlic and anchovies brought it alive
honey glazed bbq pork - good but the same thing you'd get in any Chinese place
scissor-cut noodles - I liked the lumpy cut noodles
squid ink snap noodles - my favorite--delicious doughy noodles with scallops and jumbo shrimp mixed in

Plenty of food with one IPA = $67 + tip

With Chinatown a few blocks up, I'm not sure we'll be returning to the mall the next time we have a hankering for some Chinese food. But worth checking out.</Text>

I wasn't impressed. I got kung pao chicken and one of the fried rice dishes with pork and shrimp. The pork was really fatty. The kung pao chicken didn't have much flavor. For the price, disappointing.< /text>

<Text>Decided to check this place out after watching a Martin Yan episode on TV and heading to SF the following week. While excellent, I have to say the main course was the most disappointing. I started off with the drink of Tsingtao and a shot of a strong Chinese alcohol (like a Chinese sake or something) which I highly enjoyed. We grabbed dumplings and bao for appetizers which were incredible. For the main course I had Milk Oolong Tea and crispy noodles in XO sauce. While tasty, the sauce was overly sweet (I'd say Americanized) and I was hoping for something a little more authentic. Again, it wasn't bad, but I would order something else next time. For dessert I had the Lychee Penna Cotta which was very unique and much less sweet than the main dish. Overall a very good place.< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

< Review>
M.Y. China is a hidden gem in the Westfield mall in Downtown San Francisco. Its one of the restaurants "Under the Dome". Though it is located in a mall, this place has great ambiance (perfect for date night) and the food here is A-M-A-Z-I-N-G! We ordered the crispy tofu, scissor cut noodles with tofu and Kung Pao Tofu! Yes, it is a lot of tofu but we became a fan with the first bit we took of crispy tofu. This was the best tofu my wife and I have had every period. It melts in your mouth yet doesn't break that easily. The crispy tofu was perfectly crisp and nicely spiced. We will be coming here again to try out other dishes, specially the long noodles which are famous here.

Tip: if you like lychee, try the lychee panna cota dessert here, you will regret not trying it!< /Review>

<text>Amazing experience, unexpected since it's a restaurant in a mall but the Westfield does it right. Owned by Martin Yan, the menu gives you an incredible selection of dishes celebrating the many flavors of asian cuisine. That sounds very travel-brochure-speak but the experience is one not to miss. They have a soup with short-rib that was a favorite and delicious steamed buns as well. They have a special off menu siu mai that can be ordered off the Westfield mobile app only for a limited time.<//text><time>1403155168636<//time><Resp>None</Resp>< Pictures>

food is pretty authentic chinese, and less oily than what you would find in chinatown.  however, it is also 2-3x pricier.</review>

I'm not convinced that this establishment lived up to it's hype.

It is also quite expensive. Not so much by the general local prices I suppose, but still, I think it could be better spent.<//review>

Speaking of Chinese, the impression is large for a large number of people.
However, I felt that the taste was moderate.
It doesn't mean it's not delicious, but it didn't suit me who was used to Japanese Chinese food.

<text>(Translated by Google) Authentic Chinese food, but customer service was terrible. The waiter and the front personnel were extremely rude. The only reason why I am giving such high rating is because the food is some of the best Chinese food I have ever tasted.

The dishes are delicious. My family and I like Xiao Long Bao in this restaurant. But the waiter was mean.

<Review>(Translated by Google) It is a restaurant in the department store.
Like Japan, it is a familiar Chinese restaurant.
The menu is also almost the same, such as dim confectionery, sweet and sour pork, chicken wings, stir-fried chicken wings and so on.
Chicken wings were sweet and delicious.

(Translated by Google) San Francisco's rare high Chinese restaurant. In the mall upstairs, it is very easy to find, the meal is full of people. The decoration is very Nice, the details are very good, and the service is not very warm. The taste of the store is incomparable to that of the domestic ones. Better than domestic is not too oily or too salty. Sichuan cuisine is not very spicy and is suitable for non-authentic Sichuan food lovers. It is recommended Chinese food in Sancha!

(Original)
三藩Downtown 难得的高大上中餐店。在商场楼上，很好找，饭点儿人满为患。装修做的很Nice，细节都很好，服务也非常不热情到位。店内的口味和国内没法儿比，就三藩水平来看属于中上等。比国内好的是不会太油或太咸。川菜类不是很辣适合不正宗的川菜爱好者。在三藩算是推荐中餐了！< /text>
