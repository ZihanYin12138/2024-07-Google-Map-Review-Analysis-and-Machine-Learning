Great food with professional staff. They make you feel welcome too.
I love the Red Snapper. Also the fresh cooked chicken gizzards were great. Fun place with good food.</Review>

We ordered fried catfish, shrimp, oysters, hot wings, fried okra and mac/cheese. I probably won't order the mac and cheese again but the everything else was delicious!</Text>< GmapID>

I love the food but hate the location.  To many bad elements hanging out in front of the location.  Although the food is delicious they gave me the wrong fish. I ordered cat fish and it was not cat fish.  It taste alot like swai fish.<//Text>

I was Not disappointed! KFC Ain't Got Nothing On This Finger Lickin Spot. If you can handle the crowd outside. This is the place to get it! 😛🥰🤗😋😁<//Review>< pictures>

Tasty.
I bought Shrimp & Catfish.
It was delicious.
A bit pricey, a bit salty, but flavorful & served fresh out the grease.
I'll be back.<//Text>

J J's is known for their food being good... I don't eat seafood but I've been buying their food for friends, co-workers & family for years😁 they all swear by it, however, at times I'll eat their sides- greens, the lil corn pones I call them and occasionally their dessert. They're a bit pricey but they stay busy & crowded...so you will enjoy the food, just bring a book or magazine to read while you wait!😂😂😂🖐🏻< /text>

Their fish is always good, but their chicken is very plain it needs to be seasoned and their greens need to be as well. I was disappointed about the chicken. Great customer service though! I give them 5 stars because of the excellent customer service that I always receive.< /review>

I’m not sure about these 5 stars people are posting. JJ Fish and Chicken in Antioch is just nasty 🤮 food. This business  should close down, stop serving food fried in the same old grease, no favor or just straight up salty.<//Review>

The gumbo, fried catfish, potato salad, coleslaw, red beans and rice and the fried chicken was prefect Louisiana southern cooking. I’m known to be the most finicky, picky person about taste and texture of the food that I consume and rarely I’m satisfied. This food was the best. Thank you very much, and I hope that you would move to OAKLEY. 😍😍😍🌹< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

Terrible! Poor food quality! Fish was slimy and falling apart. The fries were very stale! The driver who delivered the food through Grubhub was rude. Refused to get out of her car to find my home. Made me come outside! Overall, it’s shameful that jjs don’t have a standard when it comes to their food quality, and services they provide! Bad enough the food isn’t even fresh and is highly over priced! Never eating here again!< /review>

<review>(Translated by Google) I like to hear to wash in this place since they are very cheap for me, the washing machines have 50 Lb washers at 4.50 in other laundries they have 7.50 and those that elsewhere have them at 4.50 here are at 2.50 and those that have them in another side to 2 here they are to 1 ... and apart they wash well and have new dryers. I remember it, I am going to bar here for 13 years, hee and I keep going here and I will keep going. I like it so much that. Iako from echo park because they are very expensive elsewhere.

Awful food and service. I have not eaten out for a long time, and I was craving Asian food, and it was a complete disappointment. Half the items were not available, and one of the dishes arrived ice cold from the refrigerator. The seafood soup had no seafood, just a lot of egg and spinach. They used the cheapest plastic and foam to serve the food, and a couple of the employees were arguing in the kitchen.
All in all, I will much rather stay home, prepare my food fresh and plate it in an excellent porcelain dish than spend money to feel like an animal. Unacceptable, and it cost me $60. I can make crab cakes, buy a steak, salad and a semi decent bottle of wine for that money, and enjoy them while listening to some music. I don't need the hussle of some many restaurants that use the pandemic as an excuse to serve garbage.< /Text>

<Review>4.5, I have a few favorites that I get from this restaurant. Shanghai grilled buns is one of my favorite dishes there, takes a while to cook them, but we’ll worth the wait. If you’re getting take out, eat one or two as soon as you get them, otherwise by the time you get home or work they won’t taste the same (very hot if just made and has some soup in the bun, don’t burn your mouth!)<//Review><date>1611440805271</date><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNl4zUeu7oUkF0neGw6MQBp7y-bUmIwFjNuR91N=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures><response>None< /response><Gmap_id>0x80dcdc45a7f18f5d:0xfcc5fa8b6b94986b</Gmap_id>< user_id>

When I arrived to place my order, the hostesses seemed pretty impatient. I ordered the chicken chow mein and the pork bao. They said it would be finished in about 15-20 minutes. When I returned to receive my order, the hostess was screaming back into the kitchen at the chef, and I felt completely awkward being there. I felt it was completely inappropriate. But then my order wasn't ready on top of that. I went back outside to wait for an additional 15 minutes, and turns out my order was sitting on the table next to the cash register just waiting.

When I got home, the chicken chow mein tasted adequate, but the chicken was dry. Pork bao on the other hand was pretty good. But I'm sure it would be better more fresh. It's good food, but I feel their interaction with customers needs improvement. I felt, in my opinion, that I was bothering them to order food, and I mostly felt incredibly uncomfortable being in the midst of their yelling and screaming at one another. I don't know if I'll return. I feel I could find better service elsewhere.</Review>

We had crab noodles which were ok, but the wonton soup was the highlight for soups as it had a bone broth soup base with white pepper flavoring.  The fried fosh, string beans, and fried rice were decent.

You see "Tasty Noodle House" and think yeah, that's what they all say. But for this place, the name is totally accurate! Everything except the crispy fish is in a delicious sauce, so just dip the fish in the sauce of another dish, and it's perfect. Lots of families, friendly staff and joyful atmosphere.
In Philly, we'd have to go to Chinatown for this authenticity.< /text>

<Text>This place is not bad. My kids love their pumpkin pie. You don't have to wait for a long time to be seated. For me, I like the braised pork belly and noodles with soy bean pastry. Good taste. My daughters liked their strawberry smoothies very much. That's my recommendation as well. Overall, this is a good place for Friday dinner with your family.<//Text>< Pictures>

I love this place because they had really good noodles. It smells spicy and pungent inside. My experience was good eating here. Wonton soup and ginger scallion beef were ordered. I would love to try the back pepper chow mein next. If you're looking for spice, this is an excellent go to.<//Review>

Great for a quick mid-week lunch or ordering in.  Definitely recommend going with a group so that you can try a big range of items. Everything is great!

One of the better Chinese places in Irvine. Large portions and can be split with many people. The cold chicken appetizer was very good. The wonton broth was a little watery. I liked most, if not all of the pork dishes. Small restaurant with a lean staff, usually only 1 or 2 servers.< /Text>

Delicious food? Undoubtedly. But a little annoyed with getting things we didn’t ask for.

Pro Tip - if you have exclusively English speaking customers, it might be best to have a waiter/waitress that speaks English proficiently. Now, that’s not to say our waitress wasn’t nice, but she asked whether we wanted ice water or hot tea and we said water. She proceeded to bring us hot tea but I didn’t have the heart to be mean, it’s a small mistake.

However, we asked a question about whether she recommended one soup over the other and she thought we were asking the difference (which is still fine) but we just decided to go with one of them. She then proceeded to bring us both options even though we made no indication that we wanted both. So we ended up with extra food that we couldn’t really handle eating and spending more than we intended.< /Review>

Eggplants here are either not bad or bad. Chew and spit is not good. Not sure who orders their vegetables. They should find a better vegetable supplier. Also who ever makes the house sauce needs to have better quality control over it. Sauce is always different here. Today was really strong,dark and bad. Eggplants also arrived undercooked when I asked for them to be cooked thoroughly.<//Text>

Great noodles and dim sums. I like the seafood noodle there. The only negative thing about this place is that their fried rice is not well cooked. The other day I took my toddler there and ordered the fried rice, and my little one refused to eat. I did not know it was not well cooked until I tried it myself. Otherwise this is a good place to go. The flavor is good and not too greasy compared to some other types of Chinese food.<//Review>

Not sure what's up with the 3 star average for this place. My family has been coming here for a couple years at least and so I never checked the reviews until today. We typically order a few dishes and maybe some dumplings... maybe if you only order dumplings, the experience is just so-so. Also, I think the people who work here are usually pretty nice, so not sure what's up with the bad service experiences. Anyway, here's what we ordered today:
- tofu skin with preserved vegetables and soybeans : the tofu skin is super tender and the flavor was great despite the absence of meat. The preserved veg were fresh and not bitter
- Tai Yang snake gourd- if you haven't had this savory sort of soft squash before, I guess you might be confused. Anyway they did a good job of concentrating the squash's flavor and the added bits of dried shrimp stuff on top added some food umami
- braised pork belly with tofu skin- the flavor on this was bomb! I was surprised by the use of spices which I could swear included cinnamon (I'm guessing it's some 5 spice combo?). The sauce was wonderfully complex and the tofu was soft and soaked up all the sauce. The pork belly could have been a little more tender, but it was still tasty
- cold chicken with sesame sauce - a good deal at $7 for a decent serving of chicken. The sauce is red and looks spicy but it's totally NOT spicy - more sesame-peanuty-slightly-sweet. I liked this dish but didn't think it stood out much.

We didn't have enough room for dumpling type things, but our usual go-to is the pan fried pork buns.

Oh, and as for atmosphere...yes sometimes the tables are a little sticky. Today my leggings totally stuck to the chair after sitting for a while. I guess these things don't bother me because I assume these aspects will help keep the lines short for people like me who don't mind. :)< /Text>

The place is small and clean. Shrimp noodle soup was steaming hot just the way I like it.  It was plain, but spices are on the table for ones own taste. Waitress was friendly. What more can I ask for a quick meal. Next time I will try the dumplings. Looking forward to another day.< /review>

<text>No whites allowed!

Sound racist? It is. I live right by the Culver plaza and have waited for this noodle house to open. To my surprise, both times I went here, no body waited on me.

Despite making obvious gestures and eye contact, the waiters literally looked at me and turned around. During our 25 minute wait two other parties came in, were seated, given drinks, and served. All the while, I was thirsty and starving.

What was the common denominator both times I went here? Full of Asians ordering and speaking in Chinese. Maybe the waiters don't even know English?

Whatever it is, you should not support this diner. No matter if you are African, Caucasian, Asian or Indian, you are created equal within this country.

Someone pass tasty noodle house a memo....< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None<//Response><Gmap_id>0x80dcdc45a7f18f5d:0xfcc5fa8b6b94986b<//Gmap_id></record>

Food is very good! We make it our go-to restaurant at least once a week. The only caveat is when you pay your bill via CC. I got charged twice, same day. They charged for the food bill and then charged again for the food bill with tip. So check your CC statements. Don't know if it's a glitch in their POS system.<//text>

<Review>Tony should be doing something else since serving is not in his dictionary. We arrived, seated and waited. He came over and asked for our order. We said that we just sat down, can we have something to drink first? He did not respond and walked away, and did not return.

Food here isn't bad, but the service is atrocious.  Last time I went here, we specifically asked for spicy beef noodle soup and the waitress brought out the spicy fish and tofu soup.  When we tried to ask about the order, she immediately said no you ordered the fish, I repeated the order back to you.  Look, mistakes happen, but it's kinda hard to mix up beef with fish.  We were put off by the lack of apology, and I guess the other waitress noticed and gave us watermelon juice instead (not full cups).  I really hated the hot and sour taste of the fish soup and refused to eat more. The soup dumplings were over cooked so much that there wasn't a drop of soup inside. The only thing I really liked was the fried pork bun, which is this restaurant's saving grace.  I won't come here again.< /text>

Best Shanghainese dim sum in OC and LA. Totally beats most restaurants in San Gabriel Valley. Their pan fried pork buns are the most authentic you can find in the area. Servers speak English and are very friendly. May be the service has improved since some of the negative reviews two years ago. I love this place!!!</text>

I don't understand the previous post. I was seated with speed and got great service at lunch time. I am not Chinese or Asian.
As for the food, the Vegetarian Duck is the best I have ever had.
The Spicy Soup Noodle with Prawns is spectacular.
I also tried the Shanghai Dumplings (Xaio Long Bao.)
The Dumplings were pretty darn good. Though the best in Orange County can be had at Shanghai 3.6.9. off of Euclid in Anaheim.

All in all if you are near this restaurant go there, it's good authentic Chinese food.
I'll be going back for sure.</text>

<Text>Not worth the wait or price. Came in for take out and was told it would take 10 mins. To my surprise, everyone that was sat down after placing my order were getting their food first. Not only were they getting their food first, but some finished eating, left and my noodles were still not done. Finally, 30 mins later, we get our take out and it was nothing special. It so was bland. Will not be back.<//Text>< pics>

Authentic Shanghainese food. It's a plus because they do not over salt their food. However, salt and other seasoning are available at the table.<//text>

<text>I ordered through drivethru and I get my soda on a tray and have to grab it but they don’t even wipe the top having excess of soda and spills on my passenger seat. She noticed and she didn’t say anything and asked me what kinda condiments I want and I told her what I wanted. She didn’t add no condiments lol 😆 .It has happened before and decided to stop and give it a chance, more like a gave them a last chance of spills in my car 😂.<//text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

<Text>I celebrated my birthday last night in this great restaurant. Well it was a sensational evening and the place was no doubt one of the reasons for that outstanding meeting. The stuff  participated in a graceful style, the meals were yummy and my buddies were so  glad. We shall surely return for more celebrations. thanks very much.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

<Review>My drink was less than half way full, my burger was dry. This is the third time this month that I’ve tried this location, I’m an essential worker and it’s nearest on my way home. I’ll never come her again. Disgusting service and disgusting food.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

Unfortunately, they don't have a driver's side window for picking up your food. Unless you have a passenger to assist you, it's a little awkward.<//Review>

Not sure why I came back this time. Prices are very expensive for what you get unless there is a promotion. The burgers though freshly made are very dry and not at all juicy. The soda was a little flat but the fries were freshly made and was the best tasting.< /Review>

Twice in the past few times I've been there, they have somehow lost my order. Only after 20+ minutes of waiting and me going to the counter to ask what's taking so long, does the manager explain to me that somehow my order never showed up on the screen in the back where they make the orders! Once is forgivable, things happen, technology screws up, but twice? No way! I will now be driving to the 2nd closest location to me from now on. I should note, that in both instances, the manager made it right by refunding my money, but again, only after a 20 minute wait for food and me having to track it down. Fix your ordering system, please!<//text>

The Temple City location suuuuuuuucks.
To prove my point, it took two employees to give me this side of mayo. The employee I asked (Lizeth) was shoulder to shoulder with another employee (let's name her Bertha) that "filled" this sauce container.

Update 12/17: Now this location will charge you an additional cost if you want mayo, but the shady thing is the additional charge is not on the receipt. There's no proof that it is a store requirement because there technically is not a charge made in the register. Guess the employees really need a pay raise...<//text>

Every combo costs on average $3 more compared to other Carl's Jr. And even the cheap Hamburger that's usually under $2 is over $3 here. Such a terrible business model which will make sure I never go back.

The service and food was decent which is why I didn't give it 1 star.

But realize that you make profit by selling in bigger amounts so you can have customers coming back. If you bleed them on their first visit they will be unsatisfied and never come back.<//Review>

<text>Friendly helpful staff, I was a bit disappointed with a burger with iron rings, they offered and made another and also offered a  large order of  onion rings and a large free drinks. They work hard to bring your up fresh and hot, even the manager got in involved to get orders out faster.<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures><user>115677692607751107188<//user>< Rate>

Ordered 2 chocolate shakes at the drive up window and darned near fainted when was told that would be over $10.00. I said  $10.00. He said yes, they're  $5.00 a piece. I said I don't think so. He asked me how about with a senior discount?  I said it would still be too much. I said I'm sorry,  if I'd known I wouldn't have ordered them. ( I couldn't see the price listed on the outdoor menu.)

<text>Your food tastes ugly when served by ugly people.  You REALLY need to fire the woman that works the morning shift about 6 a.m. on Sundays.
We really enjoy your breakfast menu over your competitor up the street but your employee's borderline rude and recalcitrant behavior is about as ugly as it gets.  If she were my employee, she would be long gone.
We (and probably a lot more people) will not be back while she is there.<//text>< Pics>

It's OK... Make sure you check your food before you leave.  I always ask for No Sauce and 2 out of 3 times, Get Sauce.< /Text>

By far THE WORST Carl's Jr EVER!!!   Dry burgers, incompetent and grumpy crew and managers.  The roof leaks when it rains. Don't expect to get you what you ordered.< /Text>

(Translated by Google) worst.
Coke is not coming. Cider flavor is strange.
Keta is a liquid feeling strange.
The most important hamburger patty is turning around. It looks like it's not well .....
All you can eat is fried potatoes.
The store is not clean or cool compared to McDonald's.

(Original)
최악.
콜라는 안나오고. 사이다 맛 이상하고.
케챱 액체느낌 이상하고.
제일 중요한 햄버거 패티가 입에서 돌고있다. 잘 안익은듯.....
그나마 먹을건 감자튀김뿐.
매장도 맥도날드에 비해 깔끔하거나 시원하니 않다.ㅡㅡ</text>

I had a great experience today!!  I am pregnant and due tomorrow.  I really wanted to get my hair braided but have been worried about it due to Covid19.  I found Mimi's Beauty Supply, or should I say it found me and couldn't have felt more comfortable and safe.
The owner, Roz, took a stand and not only encouraged but demanded masks due to the fact that I was sitting at the door, getting my hair braided while pregnant.  She was constantly sanitizing handles and basically guarding my safety.  I'm thankful that I found this shop and will be going back.
A customer came in who was very rude and appalled at the fact the she was asked to put a mask on before entering but Roz, the owner, stood her ground and I was impressed.
THANK YOU ROZ, TODAY YOU WERE MY GUARDIAN ANGEL!  And...my hair looks great!<//Text>

Love this place! Mimi and her staff are extremely friendly and welcoming. I purchased hair products and had my hair braided here. If you’re looking for a good braider with affordable prices, you should definitely schedule an appointment with Jessica.<//text>

Just moved to the area and was looking for a shop with braiding hair. Happened to stumble across this shop the morning of a holiday, when most are closed and she was extremely helpful! Will definitely be going back to purchase more hair. I'm so appreciative she was there with a smile 😃<//Review>

This store is organized with a great selection. There are many beauty supply stores available, but not many that offer so much! There’s an on site hairstylist, braided, Lularoe Rep, beautician, and a pretty knowledgeable staff. I’m actually impressed with all that this location has to offer. A must stop location for your beauty supply needs. :)</Text>

I can't say enough about how amazing these tacos are I drive all the way  from Rancho Belago to indulge. I have also had them cater my mom's 70 bday party for over 150 and it was flawless everything they offer drink meats to salsas to drinks are perfection!< /Text>

The al pastor tacos are delicious. The meat is thick red big and juicy. They are served w/bits of pineapple which only makes them taste better. They have cucumbers, salsas, red onions, cilantro, limes, anything you might need for your tacos that you can grab. The food truck is on Pacific and they are parked right in front of the restuarant. So you can turn on California St. to drive into the restaurant parking. There is plenty of seating space in the restaurant. Most of the staff is by the food truck. I have only tried al pastor and those tacos get the 5 stars.<//Review>

<Date>1539918462864<//Date><Rating>1< /Rating><review>I got a Cuban torta. Worst Cuban torta I've tasted. Also they messed up my order. Which all ot was was put the avocado and queso de puerco on the side. They argued with me that they didnt understand what I meant. I explained again. Well all they did was scrape a bit of the avocado off instead of making a new one. And I hate avocado. Also to find out they had also put queso de puerco on it. All in pieces. So I had to scrape the rest of the avocado off so I had to take out the beans,lettuce and mayo.  And the queso de puerco was a pain to take out all the pieces. Will not ever return here.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

(Translated by Google) Too expensive and very bad food. 25 dlls pay for 4 sopess and a quesadilla. Last time I eat in a tacos hawk. They had already made it to me once with a Milanese cake. They only accommodate a piece of meat in the middle of the bread, the rest are beans and lettuce, they see your face there ......
Last time in my life I bought tacos hawk. I said.......

(Original)
Demasiado caro   y muy mala comida.  25 dlls pague por 4 sopess y una quesadilla. Última vez que como en un tacos gavilán. Ya me la habían hecho una ves con una torta de milanesa.  Solo te acomodan un pedazo de carne en medio del pan lo demás son frijoles y lechuga   te ven la cara ahí......

<Text>Argelia is such a wonderful person. Honestly made my day which is NOT what you expect going to the DMV. This location was very efficient too. (Do your paperwork ahead of time all you one-star voters!)<//Text><pictures>None</pictures><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>

<Review>It' s really bad u can not schedule an appointment!!! 21st century! COVID!!! It shame,  guys!
There is an avarage 1.5 hour waiting line any time.
But if u come to the opening it will be twice-three times bigger.
I would come 2-3 hours before closing it is best way to catch the smallest line.<//Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNiLT6kgIU5laQqy4H7i0IlP4p4TY-Lawz3fkcp=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOEquiet7Y-XLoSxvmRJUH9yP1LPDgoVuHh6CSC=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNXzwCTgB-pFBwHAqGhlL5vpWXbLP3ubas-PhtT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNgGmSE8Wf4ofi0GQXEbVQ4tiwPpth28aZ4pL3c=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN5GIvyhp-yjp2wuNM6XCijGxb5AxKbchk6NTiE=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures>< Resp>

Make sure to check in online and get your number. The best way to go about if no appointment. Sit back and track your status on your smart phone.</Text>

As far a DMVs go, this one is well organized. They seemed to have a lot of staff available to answer questions. They seem to be in COVID compliance, taking temps and asking screening questions.
There was a very long line that started quite early even for a Tuesday morning. It's best to get there as early as possible so that you can get out as quickly as possible.</Review>

Wait time wasn't too bad, but I wanted to make an appointment. Apparently you can only make online or call in. Tried doing online and no luck.</Text>

The lines were very long, but I appreciate Ed when I got closer the staff would go outside and ask what was needed. I was able to go into another line for car registration. It took a while but at least I was able to sit inside and the place was clean and the person who assisted me was professional.<//text>

<text>Had to go in today to renew my license and upgrading it to the "Real ID." Whenever I'm doing anything DMV related, I go to the Clovis, CA location on Shaw Avenue. The line progressed very well and the DMV employees that were outside along sure we had all the correct documents did a phenomenal job.
Speedy, thorough and friendly service has always been the reason for me to drive an extra 10-20 minutes for their service. It's totally worth the extra drive.< /text>< UserId.>

Once got to enter building there was another hour wait to see a person that could assist me. Once I explained my problem, they had me complete a form to bring to the supervisor. The form was approved and it was great service.
Advise making an appointment and bringing your checkbook with you. They now charge a fee for your debit or credit card.< /Review><name>Michael Gong-Chun<//name>< user_id>

My sister failed her driver's test because she wouldn't get in the left hand lane when told to due to an incoming speeding car. She told her that she did everything perfect but wouldn't get into the lane of the incoming car. You're telling me that you are going to fail someone who took the correct safety measures and wait for the car to pass? And she did everything else right? Get that DMV worker out of there!</Review>

Just a heads up that you have to wait outside in the heat. It's a rather long no appointment line (I was there from 12-2pm). If you have an appointment then that is a shorter line that moves rather fast. When you get to the front you're asked questions about your health and well-being from the past few weeks, your temperature is taken and then you're given a number and allowed to wait inside. Then it's just like the regular DMV where you wait for your number to be called.<//review>

<review>My only advice is do NOT go by the "estimated" wait time posted daily on their website. Tack about 3-4 hours onto that. Be very sun/heat tolerant and bring water. This COVID has not put any pep in these guys step...and so very RUDE once you do get inside. I will never go to this one again.</review>< UserId.>

An appointment is a must. I was there maybe an hour whereas people without an appointment have been waiting 3 or 4 hours. The service at this DMV is really good. I've had some really poor experiences with employees that just don't seem to care but this particular office was really good, knowledgeable and took care to give me good information with professionalism and courtesy.< /Text>

Employees are nice, but not knowledgeable of how their DC unit we works.
5 visits , told different information each time.
The DC unit I Sacramento to me I did not need to pay registration on a lease end vehicle.
Clovis DMV said I had to or I might be turned in to collections.
The I was told I can always turn in a refund request.
Does this make sense.
I'm a Senior Citizen and I don't believe I was treated fairly.< /text>

Can't make an appointment. Unsure why this isn't allowed during the times of the c-bug. Wait times hours long. Unable to renew registration online because their system is abysmal. Unable to renew registration on the phone because they don't have the ability to do so. Unsure how much more inefficient a place could be but they seem to try their best to make worse.</review>

< Review>
These people are bottom feeders. In this time of Covid19 and local fires in which our family may have lost a home, dmv has zero compassion.  We had stored an older work truck for our son since about 2010. It sat in a field on the back of our property and was never on the road. We thought we filed a non op. One of our grandsons turned 16 and our son gave him this truck. DMV would not negotiate fees at all and charged us $1500 to be able to register it, mostly penalties. Pond scum.<//Review>

I got in line at 7am this morning and the dmv employee came out at 7:50  to tell everyone that they were only doing Appointment only driving test today.   Over 3/4 of the line had to  leave.  It really SUCKED that none came out to l err th us know or at least post a sign.< /text>

<response>None<//response><review>I just returned from the DMV in Clovis. After waiting 3 hours to see the teller, I was very disappointed in her service. For example, she told me to correct the name on the form I gave her. When I asked her to repeat the question, she said "it wasn't a question". Next, she said the car tags were mailed to me, however, since I never received them, I said they must have been stolen. She said, "that's an assumption". Finally,  she never made eye contact with me, as if this was a ZOOM meeting.
I recommend DMV require all tellers to indicate their name or badge number on the directions they return to customers so improvements in their customer service can made. Very unprofessional!< /review>< rating>

< Review>
The DMV is always an experience that you would rather not have to go through, especially during the Covid 19 pandemic. The lines are always crazy no matter the day or time. If you need something done in person, you have no choice but be prepared for about a 3hr or more  window to handle a car reg, transfer, drivers license prob, out of state car reg or drivers license hold issue (items that can be handled online). It's better to come alone bc waiting in the car is uncomfortable. If your disabled, you probably won't be able to manage. The lines usually go to the edge of the building. Everyone in line must wear a mask the whole time as well as inside DMV. DMV personal will check your documents when you get to the sliding door, check your temp, ask you questions about sick people, symptoms, traveling, screening, etc then you will go inside and get a number. You must then return back outside where you stand or sit and wait for your number to be called. If you come after 4pm, you will not be seen by time prob. Security cuts the line at about 415pm to 430pm bc the employees have to finish all people who get a number by 5pm. We got to DMV at 11:30am & got home at 3:20pm. They aren't scheduling appts yet. We went the Weds before Thanksgiving & security sent the line home before 4pm. Sanitizer everywhere, social distancing, 6ft apart, etc. This was the 3rd time we went there& we finally succeeded in completing our transfer& registration.<//Review>

<Review>Was on my phone and computer for six hours trying to register for my driver license. It took three phone calls to get an appointment after being told they not making appointment by my first phone call. I got appointment for the next day at 10:20 AM. I found my phone wouldn't work with DMV computer software. When I got there  nobody was in line, l got everything in needed to get my new driver license  in about 40 minutes.</Review><response>None< /response>< rating>

<Text>The website did not have current operating hours, so instead of 5pm, their desk services are closed at 4:30pm.  I had purposely got off work at earlier at 4:30pm, just to make it there before 5, only to find out, it was a waste.  Could not get my transaction done. Saturday closures do not help the working person between 8a-5pm. Which means I have to use leave time to get off from work to come back another day. Wish appts were available to ensure we get things accomplished on day we show up.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None< /resp>< GmapID>

< Review>
The DMV, like many other government agencies, has a horrible workload thrust upon it by the COVID-19, and by their overall inability to adapt to better technology to provide better services to the public. I, unlike many others out there, do not place the blame on the people who work there. Instead, it comes down to the ridiculous number of rules and regulations they must stuff down our throats.</Review>

<review>REAL ID - those of you who are told to come to appointment line, “no appointment needed” and Express Experience, you’re in for a long wait. They have combined the Express Experience and appointment line into 1 (LONG) line. I’m convinced they are not following the new guidelines, but the rude lady in front seemed pretty sure of herself. Also, the timeline for your local dmv is off, WAY OFF. Timeline says 10 all the way through 40 minutes for waiting - I was here for 3 hours and saw these timelines.</review><pics>None</pics><Resp>None</Resp>< Gmap_id>

All I have to say is the employees need to be trained better. They need to be on the same page, they all should know the correct information and be updated on all new laws so they can share the information with everyone and so people don’t have to call corporate & be on hold for 45+ min to get the correct info, just to have to go right back to the DMV, because “they didn’t do their job right the first time” (words from the corporate woman I spoke to lol).</text>

My daughter took her driver test today 11/21/2019
She missed 2 and fail,  one error is for not looking over her shoulder when told to make a right turn which she did and not making a full stop behind the line , the  instructor has sunglasses on and look like she’s having a bad day, at the driving area there’s a sign that say right turn only and she make her turn left , if that’s not breaking the rule then what the hell . It’s ok for her to violate traffic  rules but  not looking over a should when making a turn is a automatic fail
You  need to view the camera  out appointment was at 2::17 pm in a white Ford Fusion</Text>

I prefer this DMV over the Fresno location. Typically in the past, before COVID, I was out within an hour. With or without an appt. If I came or scheduled my appt between 2 & 3pm, when parents are picking their kids up from school, it was faster.
During COVID they're not doing a whole lot in person. Don't bother taking the time off work to come in and stand in line for hours until you've looked over the hand out they're giving. I've posted it here for you to look over.
We were told If you have a driver's license or registration expired or due to expire the police are not issuing citations, they have been extended through July 31st. You can pay your fees however by dropping them off in the box out front. I did not see the extension of license and registration in writing, so be sure to verify that before taking my word for it.
We were also told if you have a question you can submit a note into the box out front, with your phone number on it, and someone will assist you by phone. Example would be, you've not received your license, registration, etc. And should have by now.
I wasted my time coming and waiting here today and am writing this for you so you don't have to waste yours. Lol! Hope it helps!< /Text>

My son failed his permit test and was told to come back in 7 days. His original test was on a Tuesday, so we came back the next Tuesday. We were then informed that it's really a week and a day before you can retest and he was unable to test. If they mean a week and a day, or what would be by every average person's definition of 8 days, state that. It is because of situations like this that people dislike the DMV so much. There is always some little thing that is required but misstated, ambiguous, or the information just isn't readily available before going to the DMV. Especially since the appointment system is basically useless now because it's so backed up, and everything is back to standing in multiple long lines again if you really need to take care of something.<//Text>

Have to wait in line outside. I suggest brining a chair and a water bottle.They let only let about 20 people inside at a time. DMV STOPS LETTING PEOPLE IN AT 4:30PM. If your not inside by 4:30 you will have to come back.< /Review>

<Review>frustrating experience, rude employee at front door. website should be updated to show what services are actually offered right now. it's misleading that it says you can complete certain processes at the office, but you actually can't...so things we once thought could ONLY be done in person, like a title transfer, can now ONLY be done online.< /Review>< Pics>

The lady was so rude to me and my mom we have barely gotten to the place for a behind the wheels test and she was so rude about the paper works we were missing and continued to be rude about the whole situation and had me and my mom scrabbling to find those papers and we still were not able to take the test, which could of been prevented if she had nicely just explained to us about those missing paper works. It was on my behalf to not have those paper works but costumer service should of been better!! The dmv should invest in a customer service class for your employees because apparently they have forgotten that everyone is human and that we mess up sometimes and that HUMAN KINDNESS EXIST. Safe to know I’m never going back to this dmv and I hope that particular person learns to be a better person and there was NO REASON for her to be that rude that early in the morning.</review>

<rating>1<//rating><text>I don't understand why DMV personal are telling drivers that if their services require a in person visit they need to make an appointment.

Fact: appointments aren't available at this time

Question: if restaurants and other places are opening up how come the DMV is lagging behind in non-appointment services.

we don't know how long the quarantine will last. THE DMV IS A GOVERNMENT ESTABLISHMENT IF THE POST OFFICE IS OPEN HOW COME THE DMV IS HAVING SUCH A HARD TIME DEALING WITH THIS?</text></record></dataset><record>

We had an appointment.  We got there early. Very helpful staff. We were done and leaving shortly after original appointment time-YES!!</Review>
</record></dataset><record>
<review>Without an appointment the wait is forever! Had an appointment but the call for my appointment reminder didn't leave a time on the message. Ended up having to wait when they are the ones that never sent me my drivers license when I renewed it last year. They can at least let you know a wait time based on your number. Called every letter but B for an hour or more while I was waiting on a number that started with B 🤦‍♀️<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None<//response><user_id>110807716481240706997<//user_id><rate>1<//rate>< GmapID>

Previous experience  with clovis DMV has been very professional. Until tuesday. Accept for two angels that were not effected by the huge croud that met me when i walked in .Unorganized mess .Computers were acting up and the facilitator was like on fire moving around trying to put fires out with mixed languages asking questions that he couldnt understand. So is it because i was old looking?? ,or was it because i was from fresno? Im wondering what happened.
To dmv clovis. Chaos plus burn out. Public loses
was from fresno.</Text>

Possibly what the DVM wants is to have stone employees with no hearts.

<resp>None< /resp><text>I had a good experience at Clovis DMV today.  I was renewing my driver license with a RealID.  My appointment was at 3:20 but as I usually do, I arrived early, at 3:00.  I was done and out the door at 4:02.  Now, I had all my proper documents and had completed the application online and had the proper confirmation code.  A nice touch was an employee who was wandering the floor checking to see if customers had the right documents while waiting.  Some did not and had to go get them.  But at least they didn't have to wait until they got to the counter and get sent away.   Know what documents you need.  Do as much as you can online.  It sure seemed to work well today.

First time I came to this location and their where signs on the windows that the clovis dmv was closed. It was a Thursday day at 1pm or so and parking lot was empty and construction workers where doing their job. I asked and they said it was closed location. The parking lot had spots that were cut open so I had to be carefully while I exited the location. Had to go to another Dmv location.</Text>

My one observation is a lack of empathy. They seem to forget they volunteered to be there for employment. We are there involuntary. No choice really. Our all not a bad experience.</Text>< Pics>

Rude staff!!! Have no idea what they are doing!! Sent me to three different people for simple vehicle renew and it took over 3 hours! Absolutely pathetic. Fresno DMV is a bit more packed but I will always go there from now on. Seeing that this was clovis I was expecting better customer service. Haha! Boy I was wrong.</text>

<Text>All DMVs need to be a little more innovative in terms of services. While it might be slightly better than Blackstone branch, it’s still in the 80’s era. However, renewing cars registration is becoming easier. Good job I guess.<//Text>< Pictures>

They sent me a letter of intent to suspend because they didn't have our information on file. I called and gave them the information and they suspended it anyway and charged me a fee.  Then when I called to get it reinstated they hung up on me after waiting for 25 minutes (They said the wait would be 7 min). Expect long waits and a billion fees.< /Review>

Terrible waste of time. Make sure you go in with no questions because if you ask one they will give you a rude response. Also when you walk in you just have one lady yelling registration line here license line over here like Jesus a sign in that area would be handy so people wouldn’t stand in the registration line for an hour. Highly don’t recommend going on a Saturday they’re even ruder. They act like us customers want to spend their Saturday at the DMV with the most depressed people on the earth.<//text>

Was there get a real ID. Gave them all the information they needed. Turns out that one of the proof of residency documents could not be used because it has to be all on one page not 2 pages. So I went home and printed out my paystub, went back gave them my updated documents then they say we can’t take this other proof of residency after They OK it already! They ended my day with sorry and they didn’t know what else to do, left without a real ID.< /review>

<review>I never write reviews, but what I expirenced today was very depressing. I was trying to change my name due to getting married, I understand all the requirements and I am happy to follow and get what I need, but the way the employee talked to me was very degrading. I was assisted by 4 different employees and only the one was very rude. When I left I prayed for her to have a better day and I hope what was bothering her gets better. Thank you for reading complaint.< /review>< pics>

The wait time is long because the staff keeps gossiping with each other. When I was being helped, I was just standing there while the worker was talking to the worker at the next desk about something irrelevant. She could've at least talked and worked at the same time. I looked around and more staff was just standing there, gossiping and laughing while people were waiting to be called.< /review>

<review>I had an appointment on 03-23-19 at 10 am to renew my license and get a real ID. I arrived at 9:40 and was out at 10:15. I had all the proper paperwork and did my registration on line and had my confirmation code for the online registration. If you do ALL of the above, you will be in and out in under an hour. If you had a bad experience at the dmv it’s most likely because you are an idiot and can not follow simple instructions. And if you were treated poorly it’s probably because you had a bad attitude and were treated accordingly. It was a pleasure to deal with the Clovis dmv.<//review><pics>None< /pics><resp>None<//resp><gmapID>0x80945b944fd76265:0xa8d2edcec540ad10< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Not a nice place to visit. I was given the wrong form the first time I visited and they made me pay a second fee to get the correct form. There is no order to the line if you get there early, so if you get there to beat the line you may end up at the end any way. The lines move very slow and the employees love to talk to each other while the lines are full. No dmv is fun but this one needs help.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None< /resp><gmapID>0x80945b944fd76265:0xa8d2edcec540ad10</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<review>This place needs to act the they have some customer service skills becuase they have none. Nobody there has a smile on their face. If they acted the way they would at att store this place would not be as bad. Not one person in there wants to be there including the people that dont work there. I don't even think no one will ever care about us there Becuase we all have to be there. there is not another company to go to so its sort of like a monopoly and last time I checked that was illegal. So we could complain all we want but no one will care. Its not like they're gonna run out of business.</review>< resp>

Wish I could give this DMV negative stars. I live in a rural town so anything is pretty far. I Googled "dmv open today" now today is a Saturday. I drove 52 minutes. I get to the DMV and their sign reads that it is closed Saturday and Sunday! I don't know if it is a Google error or DMV but this has been a huge waste of my time!!! FYI hours are M-F 8-5.< /review>

<Text>The waiting time was too long. To start off my appointment was at 10:20 and didn't get to even test until 11:20. The employees are way too rude because one of the lady that was testing me told me if I was even allowed to drive because of my height. They ask weird questions as well and the service was way TOO POOR. Take it from my experience, you all should go to another DMV.< /Text>< Pictures>

<review>People already don't want to go to he DMV and yet somehow the DMV allows people to work there who make the situation much worse. Some, not all, employees clearly hate being there and have an exceptional way of making you feel like an inconvenience to them, while they are at their job that they applied for. I understand that people can be difficult, but not everyone is an idiot. Most people want to get out of there asap.</review><Response>None< /Response></record>

Horrible very horrible. Took my 2nd drivers test and the lady instructor failed me because she thought I went into the bike lane. I was away from the bike lane. And she said I didn't look at my windows when I did . As a 17 year old don't come to this DMV they're too strict and will fail you on the spot. Fresno DMV is much better and less strict.<//Text>

Some of the employees are rude and foul tempered.  I found that they tend to be a bit racist as well. After standing in line for a few hours before we even received a number, my self and some other customers noticed preferential treatment shown towards some folks of the same ethnicity as the employee doing the sorting. She became insulting and foul tempered when dealing with folks of a different ethnicity than hers. I wish I got her name i would blast her all over the web. This place definitely blows. If this site would let me give it negative ratings I would . So I'll rate that "jaina  a nagativo 100 strellas" ...< /text>

The Clovis DMV used to be much better. You could get in and out in 20 minutes or less with friendly staff, unless they screwed up or made a mistake. Now they are constantly making mistakes, pawning you off, changed to a less efficient and longer process to get seen.

I had to come in last week to get plates replaced due to theft, instead of checking me in and validating my info like they used to, they just pushed me to a different line, waited two hours, get seen, get told that due to an internal issue from November that they were aware of my insurance hadn't been reported for the vehicle and my registration was on suspension. Even though I had the proof of insurance with me, and past cards proving I had it the whole time. I was told I had 2 choices, contact my insurance to have them call the Sacramento DMV and sort it out, or pay a reinstantment fee of $14. But, could not pay at the window, either by mail, online, or at the kiosk, since local DMV doesn't cooperate with their main office, but whatever, paid it on my phone on the spot, showed the confirmation to the clerk at the window and get told that it all looks good, but I have to wait till the next week for it to clear due to processing time and for their main office in Sacramento to bounce it back to them. Because, apparently the DMV isn't the same across the state...</Review>

Very rude female at counter for ID line.  My granddaughter was on the right side of rope should hv been on left side.  Mind you rt side was for appts only but doesn’t state that.  I asked about the new calif I’d and she said that is not a passport you  can’t use it for a passport. Im an RN im not ignorant I have more education than her.   Anyhow I’ll get the new ca ID at another time hopefully with a nice person not a rude person !!!<//Review>

Rude clerk at the front door. What one question to see if the form that I had was an actual registration it didn't say. She ask did you pay. I said yes. She ask did you do the smog I said yes. She ask when. I said last year but cant remember what exact date. She rudely grabbed the paper and placed it on roughly on the counter and said NO in a rude way. I was thinking is she being rude, so I ask no its not a registration or no your not gonna tell me. She said no im not gonna tell you. I said what..  I was about to leave but I thought hell no. So I told her I just want to know if it was a registration yes or no that it. She said no it not a registration. Maybe she seen I kept my cool.</Review>

I had to get my license renewed so I made an appointment at this DMV online. I went on a Tuesday morning at 10:30 a.m. I arrived at 10:40, but they still got me checked in and gave me a number. Within 45 seconds my number was called. I finished filling out my paperwork and the woman at the window processed me within 2 minutes. I got in line to take my photo, and that only took 5 minutes. Got out of that place by 11:00.

On a Tuesday morning, there were not very many people there. Everyone was quiet and respectful. It was spacious and there was lots of available seating.

I don't know what it's like when it's busier, but my experience was a positive one for a DMV. I've been to about 10 DMVs in at least 6 cities, and this was one of the better experiences.</Text>

<text>Was waiting outside for my number to be called, didn't notice the time and they locked the doors and would not let me in. I had my number and showed it to the security guard but he said I can't come in because I was outside when they locked the doors. He got the manager for me and she was ruder than he was and lied and said they announced over the intercom that they were locking the doors, and that it says on the door they will lock you out if you're not inside before 5. I was there for over an hour to be locked out and not let back in and I had a number, she said it was policy and that if she let me in the she would have to do it all the time. If it's policy then post it on something, that if your not inside before 5 they will lock you out.< /text>< Pictures>

<Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None<//response><Text>I had TWO bad experiences when visiting the Clovis DMV this past week! A few days ago I went to renew my sales license, and the employee that took my photo was pleasant until I didn't understand how she wanted me to stand for the picture. She raised her voice at me and was visibly annoyed, but I attempted to shrug it off.
I had to return to the DMV today because I was missing a document that was supposed to be given to me on my first visit. The receptionist at the non-appointment line did not seem to believe me at first. She was very short with me, and accusatory. I felt like I was trying to avoid an argument with her and even asked at one point if she was okay!? She finally went to get a supervisor involved and come to find out, yes, they had forgotten to give me said document.
Hoping these ladies at the DMV have some better days, be more responsible for the attitude you project.< /Text><date>1530851920128< /date>< name>

The Staff is rude, the process is archaic, and the Management needs to be replaced.

As much money as Californians pay in DMV fees' Californians should be treated with courtesy, respect, and good customer service.

Most DMVs consider Californians their Cash Cows...lining up for the slaughter....

DMV equals Slaughterhouse.< /review>

<Text>I went in to DMV today to pay for my renewal registration. I was standing at the renewal registration machine trying to pay for my renewal, it asked to scan the bar code on the paper. Scanner would not read correctly. So I proceeded to enter the RIN number. A number I didn't clearly see at first. I was looking in the wrong area. (I was feeling rushed because there were others behind me waiting to use it) Instead of standing for a long period of time, I went to the :"Start Here" Line. Not realizing the line was for appointment only, Lady asked if I had an appointment, I responded with, "I have a question regarding the renewal, I'm using the machine." She tried to direct me to the Non-Appointment line. Each time I tried to respond with my question, she would just cut me off mid-sentence. Sounding more retentively anal than professional as she should with a little courtesy. After today, I found out that is just asking for too much. Next time, I'll just pay for it online. Its clear that some DMV employees do not have, or have not been trained to have common decency when dealing with customers may have one simple question about a DMV Machine that could be clearly pointed out on a piece of paper but keep Insisting that I stand in a line with upto 30 or 40 people moving nowhere fast.
A re-train of employees even at the Clovis, Ca. location seems to be needed. Dire need of improvement. I'm sure I'm not the only one who thinks so.
They could do better than give snobbish attitudes towards paying customers.
This issue happened at 1:38 P.M. on 12/26/2014

I won't be going there for a long while.<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None<//response><GmapID>0x80945b944fd76265:0xa8d2edcec540ad10<//GmapID></record>

<review>worst dmv ever.  if you dont have appointment and you get in line you get categorized into whatever what you are trying to get done.  lets say you want to renew registration.  youll have to wait at least two hours minimum because these workers are dumb and slow and becaise a ton of people are usually here for this kind of category.  blackstone and sierra dmv is awesome though. it is first come firsr serve.  wished this dmv wsd the samr insyead of cayegorizing people.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None<//Response>< gmap_id>

3 HOURS. We were there for 3 hours because SOMEONE, either the DMV or the mail, LOST my fiancés license. No explanation. NOTHING. Well, except 3 hours of time I could have not spent inside the embodiment of hell itself. And when our number was finally called? Not only was the the person 'helping' us rude, but it took like 4 minutes. 3 hours for something that took 4 minutes. God help any souls who dare to venture into this quagmire of complete ineptitude.<//review>

The slowest service ever. YOU CAN HAVE MORE PEOPLE AT ALL WINDOWS BUT NO! I see your employees just twirling their thumbs or walking around behind the counter aimlessly. I've been here for 4 hours! I have stuff to do, like go to work!</Text>

I don't know why people that are working here are so rude it's ridiculous . If you don't like your job maybe your at the wrong place . The wait time is stupid , people walking around trying to be busy and really not doing anything get it together Clovis.i will never go back to this  place ever somebody needs to take a day and see how this horrible place is ran and do something about it..</Text>

Been here since 9 AM and they haven't started calling the B tickets. There is even a long line for those who have appointments. There are a lot of empty windows with no Clerks to assist.< /Review>

< review>
We were there to get a print out of all my information on my identification card it said it would be 5 dollars and we waited in line till we got to the counter and there was a very rude lady at the desk telling me that I couldn't do this I forget the name of what the form was called but we called the DMV office and they said we could do it but this lady just wanted to sit there and say no there wasn't such thing of this paper that I could get and I just walked out</review>

(Translated by Google) I didn't like how the lady on line 16 in clovis answered me, she charged me 2 times and the bank refused because she was charging me the same bill twice, I had to call the bank to cancel what they had charged me and I couldn't get the plates of my car they should improve that is not good it is a disappointment.

(Original)
No me gustó  como me atendió la  señora  de la línea 16 en clovis  me cobró 2 veces  y el banco  rechazo  porque ella  me estaba cobrando  2 veces  el mismo  bil  tuve que llamar al  banco  para  cancelar  lo que  me  abian cobrado  y no pude  obtener las placas de mi carro deberían de mejorar eso no esta bien es una decepción.<//text>

<text>This was the smoothest, classiest, most professional experience I could have wished for. Evan kept in constant contact with me, refining his ETA to the minute. He was conscientious, charming, and made the whole process feel effortless. He was especially delighted to answer my questions about the company's environmental policies. It's not often your service technician has a college degree in environmental science, so he was able to clearly explain exactly how conscientious and socially responsible each of the company's disposal processes were.< /text><Rate>5</Rate>< Resp>

This was the most transparent and professional transaction I have experienced in forever! The web site was very straight forward and the transaction was even better. I booked an appointment around 10:00 pm on Saturday and they showed up at my door the following day on Sunday at 10 am (they did call to say they were on their way)! At 10:30 it is done and I am at this keyboard typing my most excellent review! Highly recommend!< /Text>

I can’t say enough about the service I received from Andrew today in the removal of our hazardous materials. Calling and scheduling the appointment couldn’t have been easier and I was offered a next day appointment which is pretty rare these days. Andrew was extremely communicative about and flexible in his timing and he kept me aprised of the situation at every step. The payment and calculations of waste by the pound was so transparent and convenient. It’s so worth the money to know that it’s being disposed of properly and safely and that now the garage is free of dangerous chemicals!</text>

Great service vs. having to do multiple trips to drop off used paint.  And it's for a good cause too - they donate or repurpose the paint!

Good communication.  They just need a payment portal on their site vs. using square at the door.  But 5 stars none-the-less< /Text>

From my first phone call to this company I was impressed.  They were quick to respond to my call. Sergio was very informative and set up an appointment within days.  From the call, I already knew exactly what to expect when they came out.  The technician was knowledgeable, on time, thorough and very courteous.  They did a great job! I would highly recommend this company.</Review>

Just recently purchased a home,  moved in and to my surprise found over 18 cans of paint (which included the big barrels of paint) that the previous owners left behind!  So glad I found this service.  They came by on time and removed the paint (over 240lbs of paint!!).  Service was great!  Definitely use this when you have hazardous things to remove at your house that you can’t throw out at a normal dump!< /Text>

Like some of the other reviews, we could of drove to a S.A.F.E center but to load our suv and risk spilling plus we just never made the time for it with just weekends off. We felt it was better for for us to have a professional handle the items. Had over 140 pounds of chemical waste after a remodel. Felt great to have someone carry it off responsibly. Evan was so polite and arrived right on time.  Would recommend for those who have waste laying around with little time to spare. The cash is worth it for peace of mind! Expect to more than the base price. But worth it. Don’t want that stuff laying around in the hot sun.< /Text>

<Text>I so appreciated this service.  I had several like 10-13 1/4, 1/2 gallon and at least 6 quarts of partially used cans of paint. Transmission fluid, oils, coolant jugs and pesticides that I know only had less than 1/2 of the product yet hadn't been touched in years that were in my garage.
This was so simple you register your appointment on line they call to confirm and the gentleman was so pleasant he arrived masked and gloved ready to haul.  He weighed everything in front if me.  He was gone in about 30 minutes total. And it was totally worth it rather than me load up stuff in my car and deliver to several different places.
I definetly recommend this service.< /Text><rate>5</rate></record>

I called HazAwayToday.com and had it all picked up on the same day by a very professional young man who explained what he was doing and checked in with me throughout the process and made sure I understood what to expect. I really appreciated this information as it was a big job. I would highly recommend this company.< /Review>< Pictures>

Wonderful from the very first google search.  Easy webpage, live person on the phone, Evan, who came out to our house, kept us informed if his timing.  When he came he was great!  Efficient and friendly.  He explained what he was doing while he worked, told us how different products are recycled.  A oerfect experience cleaning out our parents’ garage ( which could have been pretty cruddy!). We love you guys!  Thank you!<//Review>

We received same day services, which was a bonus! Andrew kindly explained how the procedure would go and helped dispose of some very old household chemicals. Neat, tidy work. Easy from first phone call to payment. Will definitely recommend and call again. Thank you!< /Review>

<Text>Wow! This company responded quickly, scheduled a SAME DAY appointment, communicated updates during the day, then showed up early and got to work. Evan spent hours sorting, researching ingredients, and making things safe to transport. (Our family member held onto every paint can, car repair item, cleaner & battery since he met adulthood, it seems!) This service is way more complicated than a just a pick up - he tested contents of unknown items, consulted their in-house chemist for unique risks, and packaged everything in safe, prepared containers.

A major shout out to Evan - professional, knowledgeable, kind and good natured. We appreciate his persistent attention to detail mixed with his friendly interaction. We are more than relieved to have allllll those things cleared out of the neighborhood!<//Text><response>None<//response>< name>

<Review>Total smooth and professional experience.  Booked online. Received a phone call to confirm everything. Got another call the day before to re-confirm.  Got a call morning of delivery saying they had a cancellation and asked if they could come earlier - worked even better for me!  Came masked up, explained the process, reconfirmed price and got to work.  Done in about an hour.  Showed me breakdown of items and their weight. Pls note that you need to pay attention to how much stuff you have as it effects the price.  More pricey than I thought, but I under estimated the weight of what I had.  But easier than having to load and transport on my own- don't think I could have transported that weight in my car.  Would definitely use again - just wont wait until I have so much to dispose of due to cost.  A+ service!< /Review>< pics>

I contacted HazAway Today to pick up Hazardous waste. They responded immediately and scheduled an appointment for the next day. They kept me informed of their arrival time and did come as scheduled. Our technician was Evan. He was very polite and professional. It was a very good value for me saving multiple trips to the Hazardous waste site. I would highly recommend this service.</text>

I’m so glad I found HazAwayToday! I had years worth of old paint taking up room in my garage and they had an appointment for me right away, Andrew showed up on time, weighed my paint and took it away! So easy and so nice! Thanks again!< /Review>

Found this service through a simple google search and couldn’t be happier with the experience. Within the same day I submitted a rough outline of what needed to be hauled away, I was connected with Kyle who came out for a free estimate. Everyone I interacted with was courteous, professional, and showed a willingness to work with us on our specific job needs. Would highly recommend to anyone in need of hazardous waste removal!< /Review>

I scheduled a pick up at my home to get rid of a lot of old paint that the previous owner had left. Haz Away called to confirm what was being disposed of, kept me up to date on pick up times, and were prompt and professional. It’s covid and they were wearing masks without being promoted to. I will definitely use them again and recommend them to friends.< /text>

The service is professional and fast service. They are also very accommodating, I had to reschedule 3 times and they had no issues with it. I also learned a few new facts about hazardous waste and how they process or recycle hazardous waste material. Overall great service!</Text>

<text>Daniel was the person I got for this service call. He was polite and professional. He also took the time to explain things and he handled my appointment with my best interest in mind. I would recommend this company, it was super easy. It was a bit more than I expected price wise because it’s hard to evaluate the amount of waste when it is liquid or you don’t have a scale. The fact that it was more than I expected price wise, was a non issue because of the fact that Daniel was very good, knowledgeable, great with communication, on time, and the list goes on. Overall very satisfied.<//text>< resp>

We are moving offices and had a lot of e-waste to have removed. The response time was very quick. I spoke with Sergio to set up the appointment and the driver Daniel arrived on time. Both men were very professional and Daniel was very personable. Every aspect of working with this company was pleasant. I would certainly use them again and recommend them to others.< /review>

The appointment was easy to schedule and pickup occurred the following day. The associate that assisted (Daniel) arrived on time and was a joy to do business with. The whole transaction was completed within a matter of minutes. I wouldn’t hesitate to call on them in the future.< /Text>

We were on a short time frame schedule and had hazardous waste to dispose of. Our schedule didn’t allow us to wait for the weekend to go to a permanent disposal site. HazardousAway came to our house the next day after finding their website and took away the contents of two trash bags of hazardous waste and several E-waste items. The technician was courteous and very efficient in sorting, weighing, and removing the waste. Thank you HazardousAway!!<//text>< pictures>

We had a lot of old paint and cleaning supplies that we had to dispose of before we moved.  The HazAwayToday crew responded promptly and called to see if they could show up ahead of schedule because they were in the area.  They were very professional and courteous.  We would recommend them!< /review>

We decided to clean our garage this weekend and needed to discard many half used gallons of paint, as well as many old electronics. At 11:30 we called HazAwayToday and spoke to Kyle. He was friendly and knowledgeable and told us he could be to our home by 1:00pm. He showed up exactly on time and he took all of our stuff, for a very reasonable price. We were really impressed! We are so glad we used HazAwayToday , as I’m sure you will be too when you use this great company!<//text>

The crew was prompt, early even. They were very systematic, carefully sorting and packing the different types of materials. There was a lot to dispose of and it was done very efficiently. Would recommend Haz Away Today to anyone who needs materials recycled to keep this stuff out of landfills. Great job!< /Text>

Daniel is the one who came out to my home. He kept in contact and called  letting me know when he would arrive. He was very helpful, kind , smart, and professional. Friendly, he answered all my questions, happily showed me what he was doing. Advised me on safety with household cleaning products / what not to mix together to avoid a toxic reaction. I didn't know....glad I do now! He may have saved my life!
Example... I learned
Bleach + vinegar =  deadly mustard gas!  I use both a lot....but not together now! Thx Daniel!💗☺</review>

BRANDOM SHOWED UP WHEN SAID HE WOULD (same day I called). He was very helpful and informative.  Went about his business and finished in about 40 min. I was a little shocked at the bill,  but I did have quite a bit of stuff. Probably should have taken it little at a time to free drops when they were in the area. All and all, a good experience except for the cost.<//text>

Yesterday, I gathered a random assortment of household hazardous waste materials that had accumulated over 40 years.  Not wanting to wait for the next monthly drop-off station, I struggled to find a place to drop-off the chemicals on a weekday.  Luckily, I discovered Haz Away Today.  I called them to schedule an appointment, and they were able to come the next day.   They called in the morning to confirm their arrival time, and then showed up exactly on time as promised.  And once here, the process was super easy.  The Haz Away Today representative was very nice and professional.  He sorted, weighed and hauled away all of the chemicals,  and he was diligent in not including empty bottles or items that weren’t actually hazardous waste (meaning I did not get overcharged).  All-in-all, it was a great experience and a great relief not to have all those chemicals around.   Worth every penny!<//review>

First time using service with HazAwayToday, they called before arrival, and ON time as I was given a window from 8-10 am.  Please ask for Daniel, he was very professional, courteous and knowledgeable about the questions I had about hazardous materials. He deserves recognition for providing excellent customer service, and, it’s so wonderful that they provide pick up service at your doorsteps..I highly recommend HazAwayToday, thank you Daniel!</Text>

HazAway is an amazing company ! They come to your home or business to pick up all flammable items, paint cans and they bring all the paint back and mix it up and use the paint for painting government facilities!!
So it’s a win- win!!  They are very professional and I highly recommend them!!
Daniel and team were great to work with!!
I arranged a pick up the very same day!!
The cost is very reasonable !!
You don’t have to box things up- they do everything for you!!</Text>

What a fantastic company! Everything was incredible smooth and efficient. I scheduled the pick up, they confirmed with an email, followed up a day before the pick up, and called twice on the morning of the pick up to verify that they were coming. Courteous and friendly, and way more convenient than driving out to the disposal site multiple times.  Can't recommend them highly enough!!< /Text>

Incredibly fast, friendly & professional business. So glad I found this company and they were able to come quickly to pick up the extra paint that was blocking up our storage room. I’m happy to know the paint might end up being used to paint a school or govt building and most likely will not be going in a landfill. Highly recommend this service!< /Review>

<text>Hazaway did a great job from start to finish! They were efficient and prompt in arranging pick up. They confirmed time in morning and the technician was very informative of the process they use to recycle or when necessary, dispose of chemicals in most sustainable way possible. It seemed worth the price for peace of mind knowing our household toxic waste would be taken care of properly.</text>< userid>

I recommend and will use them in the future, should the need arise.<//text><pics>None< /pics>< response>

Fantastic service! The technician was courteous and on time. He even called to give me a more specific ETA because he knew I had to pick up my children from school. He gave me a fair price and took everything away quickly. Awesome job! I will definitely recommend Hazaway to my friends and family.< /Review>

Incredibly fast, friendly & professional business. So glad I found this company and they were able to come quickly to pick up the extra paint that was blocking up our storage room. I’m happy to know the paint might end up being used to paint a school or govt building and most likely will not be going in a landfill. Highly recommend this service!</text>

Great experience working with HazAwayToday! They came and took everything that 1800-GOT-JUNK wouldn't: old paint and aerosol cans, dead batteries, those annoying energy-efficient light bulbs you can't put in the trash, you name it. The person who came to pick up the stuff was incredibly nice and helpful, and also told me about how they work with other companies to recycle paint and aluminum cans. Really great service and very reasonably priced.</Text>

We contacted Hazawaytoday to have our residential haz waste disposed.  The technician arrived on time and began working immediately after explaining the service and fee. The technician was very friendly and extremely professional.  He sorted our 300+ pounds of waste and completed the work in about one hour. We highly recommend Hazawaytoday</text>

<review>They came to me and hauled away 30+ years of old paint. The first 50lbs were free so the $damage$ was minimal. The men were efficient and polite and the transaction was complete in 15 minutes. The best part? The paint that still has a label on it gets re-used!<//review><gmap_id>0x80c2b1417ed62ed7:0x71858512f36f721b</gmap_id><response>None< /response><username>Kerry McOsker<//username><userid>113307445179252103086<//userid>< Date>

They were super fast and friendly! He even gave me pointers and tips about what can and can't be disposed of and was very informative and answered my questions. I had a lot of paint and some oil and they were able to take care of it all for a reasonable price and even weighed it right in front of me. Will definitely be contacting them again highly recommended!
Thank you!</Review>

Val, was extremely helpful when I called about picking up the old paints in my garage. She worked around my schedule. She was friendly and quick to respond.

Sergio did a very nice job. He was courteous. He too was concerned with my schedule. He cleared the paints out in a very timely manner  I would definitely use HazAway again.</Review>

Very convenient, just call them, they show up, take away the old paint and cans and pay them.   A lot better than trying to bring to dump and have it spill all over your own car.</text>

Company was on time and efficient. Daniel called me 30 minutes prior to the 2-hour window and let me know his ETA. I am definitely going to recommend them to family and friends. If you have any hazardous waste and don't want to hurt the environment, give them a call!<//Review>

Had an excellent experience with Daniel from HazAway today.
I got a same day appointment & he called to let me know how long it’d be until he arrived.
Upon arrival Daniel was friendly & professional & removed my old paint cans quickly & at a fair price :)

Would definitely recommend & would use again - great service!<//Review>

<Review>The guys that came were very nice and explained the weight and charges every step pf the way. It’s very expensive.. I was shocked at first I’m not going to lie but in the end it’s being disposed responsibly. The 2 men that came should get s raise😊 I gave  a 4 ⭐️ Simply because it was so darn expensive
Thanks<//Review>< pics>

I was faced with the problem of cleaning out a garage and had quite a bit of old paint and other hazardous materials to get rid off . I really had no idea of how I was going to do it. I was able to find HazAway through a google search , and from my first phone call and through service delivery , I have been completely pleased and impressed . The person I spoke to on the phone was pleasant , professional , and helpful. He was very upfront and clear about pricing and told me what to expect . Ryan and Shawn arrived at my location when they said they would , and both of them were also , courteous , professional, and efficient . They completed the work in an expeditious and thorough manner . I found the pricing to be very reasonable .

I would use HazAway again in a heartbeat and have already referred several family members<//review>

<Text>I had some paint left over from previous renters and wasn’t sure how to properly dispose of it. Hazaway was the best choice after a google search. Sergio took my call and set everything up so I didn’t have to lift a finger, sent someone over and loaded everything up the next day. Definitely recommend to anyone that needs materials removed that require specific handling. They were extremely informative and punctual. Sergio is the man!<//Text><response>None<//response>< Date>

<text>This is a excellent service. Daniel was friendly, informative and knowledgeable of the items I needed discarded. The price was half bad considering other locations or business took an eternity to help you out. Daniel and his company Hazmat are not only a professional and knowledgeable but are super convenient. They arrive to your home at the schedulers time and within 20 min remove all your items. Definitely recommend them to you (if you reading this) and my friends. Usually don’t leave a comment but I felt I needed to as the Service as outstanding. Thank you again Daniel<//text>< userid>

<Text>What a great service! We had years and years of paint, lawn, home and misc hazardous materials that needed disposing of. I found HazAwayToday in my quest to figure how to dispose of everything - properly.  Couldn’t have been easier - I booked a day a window online, they called the day before to confirm, called again the morning of with an update and showed up on time. Daniel was my guy and he sorted, weighed and then took it all away - all 200+ pounds and he answered any and all questions along the way. Really great service- glad they are in CA!!</Text><Resp>None< /Resp>< Gmap_id>

I was actually referred to Ryan and HazAway by one of his competitors. I was calling around for quotes and they let me know that they were busy right now, but that they actually use his services for their own disposal. That's one way to get rid of the middleman!

Overall, the experience with Ryan was top notch and highly professional. I would 100% use his services again.< /review>

<Text>After many frustrating phone calls to other companies to dispose of our household hazardous materials and being told they only have odd days to dispose of these, I found this company online.  After 1 quick phone call, I had a next day pickup at my home scheduled.  Everyone was helpful, courteous and on time.  I highly recommend this company to anyone that needs to dispose of their hazardous waste.  Skip the frustration and call Hazaway Today.< /Text>< pics>

My experience with HazAwayToday was spectacular. From the moment I contacted them, they were professional, courteous, and easy to communicate with. They gave a time for pick up, and met it easily. What a nice surprise to not have to wait till the last minute of the block of time, and then have them call and say there were late. They could teach the cable, telephone, and many other Service providers a thing or two. Each employee was a real pleasure to work with. And what a great service. When they arrived, my neighbor saw the truck, and they worked with him to remove his hazardous materials too...USE THEM...you will be glad you did and help our environment too...</Text>

I needed to have some old paint, oil and solvents removed from a property  that just sold.  HazAway came the same day I called and Sergio was great.  He was on time, very professional, quickly gave me the estimate and then efficiently removed all items requested.  I will definitely use this company again and highly recommend them and Sergio!< /review>

<Text>On short notice, Ryan cane in and cleaned out 380 pounds of paints and other hazardous materials. He then offered to clean out the remainder of our garage and haul it to the dump. He was a live saver! Ryan was professional on the phone too. He offered an estimate once he saw how much we had.
I highly recommend Ryan and Hazaway Today! Best decision we’ve made!!!<//Text>< Time>

<Review>I had several cans of paint on my balcony and realized at the last minute that the HOA was planning on refinishing the floor the next day. There were to many to take to my local paint store. In the morning I looked for a company to pick up all the paint. I called HazAwayToday.com and it was barely an hour before they had a professional at my door to remove it. Daniel came over in his big Mercedes van. He was friendly and pleasant and hauled all the paint away. In addition I had some other "junk" on my balcony and he took it away as well. I can highly recommend this company for paint disposal and any other stuff you may have.

The HAZAWAY TODAY. Helped us remove our old paint that nobody would recycle it for us. They were punctual and Daniel took care of us.
If you have a need for recycling any hazardous materials don’t hesitate to call HAZAWAY TODAY.</text>

If you don’t have time to run your household hazardous waste to the county facility or just don’t want the hassle, this company is a great way to go. Easier to get ahold of than my regular waste company, they answer the phone on the weekends and schedule weekend pickups which is very convenient.   Phone reps were friendly, professional and knowledgeable, and pricing was straightforward and easy to understand with no hidden fees. Easy to schedule pickup times. The guys who came to pick up the waste called ahead to let me know exactly what time they’d be there, and they showed up on time. They were all very professional and courteous. They even picked up the area after they loaded and hauled the waste to their truck. Would definitely recommend this company, and will use them in the future.<//text><pics>None</pics><response>None<//response>< Gmap_id>

I was going to haul many cans of paint and old electronics to the dump, but I found this great company on the internet.  I sent an email to them this morning around 10am.  They called me back immediately and were at my door at 12:45pm!
Kyle and Dan were so professional and courteous.  Kyle has recently served two years in the Peace Corps and all four employees have degrees in Environmental Studies.  Instead of taking your unwanted paint and electronics to the dump, they work in collaboration with non-profit companies to recycle and repaint homes for those who cannot afford it.
I love that our toxic substances are not going into the Earth, but are being recycled and helping others!< /review>

<review>Amazing service run by awesome people. I was stuck with years of household cleaners and hazardous items as I was preparing for a cross county move at the last minute. The woman I spoke with on the phone said that their trucks were all booked during my time frame, but she actually went out of her way to pick up the items from me personally. These people really care, and are running a super valuable service.<//review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

I just moved into a new house and the previous owner left me a gift of over 30 half used paint cans and other hazardous products spanning from the last 50 years.   My initial thought was to just throw it away, but I knew that would be awful for the environment.   I googled paint removal and Hazaway today popped up first.  From the minute I called to the minute they took away my last item it was a first class experience.    I am recommending them to anyone and everyone.< /Review>

Ryan and all the guys at HazAwayToday were awesome.  I had tried for a while with other larger and "more professional" companies to get material hauled away from my business to no avail.  After a phone call and communication with these guys pickup was scheduled next day.  Sergio the driver who came to pick up material was also very friendly and energetic.  Thank you and we will definitely be using HazAwayToday from now on.< /Review>

Best. Idea. Ever.  They arrived on time, helped me move everything hazardous from the garage and hauled it away.  If you have been wanting to clear all the old paint cans, motor oil, cleaning solvents, whatever,  this is the way to go.</review>

<Text>I’m moving and I had a small “collection” of old paint, household cleaners and othe toxic stuff to be rid of. There is no convenient drop off for these things so I look for something online and found HazAwayToday, a pick up service. I filled out a fir and schedule a convenient pick up time a week away. They called the night before and the morning of to tell me when they would be here. They sorted, weighed and carted away 200 lbs of toxic stuff! The were punctual, friendly and efficient! Thank you!< /Text>< pics>

Its aweful pricy, but as I'm physically incapable of hauling it to Dunn Edwards myself, it was necessary.  I will say the 2 gentlemen who came to puck things up were exceptionally polite and helpful.  They even helped me clean up after the paint and stuff was gone.< /Text>

<review>My highest accolades to HazAwayToday!  I called HazAwayToday to take away the hazard waste collection of 52 years; a senior citizen craftsman and hoarder.  You name it was there; roof tar, paint, wood finish, a tire, electrical wire, cleaning agents, mineral spirits, etc. etc.  Technicians Ryan and Daniel came prepared to take it all away, which they did.  They were professional, pleasant and expedient in their work.   I received a much lower price than I expected.  Thank you HazAwayToday for making it financially feasible for the consumers to be good stewards of our environment.</review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

I should have read the reviews 1st. Thank God I used my CC for the transaction. Sent an email and called 1. Number is disconnected and the other is a voicemail. Glad my purchase just says pending and my CC does have a time period, it sucks that you a company that doesn't legitimate.  Next up BBB and I call to the CFPB.<//review>

I recently purchased one of their products but was sent the wrong one. I tried contacting them by phone but it’s impossible to reach them, voicemail directs you to email them instead. I emailed them to inform them of their error and they emailed back within an hour, apologized for the error and took care of it immediately.<//Review>

Absolutely horrible!!!!

DO NOT USE!!

They charged my card and sent me an invoice saying my payment has processed and my order is “trash”. When I tried to contact them to understand the mixup I discovered you cannot get ahold of them. A week later still no contact or refund. What the heck?!<//Text>

Fair prices, plenty of options but as of 03/13/20, and probably awhile before then, the phone number listed on Google and on their website is "Not currently in service", and aside from an automated message the day of my purchase, after trying both available emails, I've received no response from the company regarding my order, ETA, or any response at all.
Not sure if they are temporarily closed, out of business or what but if there is anyone working there they arent taking care of the online side of the business.<//review>

So its 5/16/2020 i order a 4 channel Rockford amp. 165.00 on the 13th of May. After reading other recent reviews going back to February i noticed a lot of ppl saying the same thing. Ordered  status says pending, no numbers to call (that work) and no response from customer service. I use USAA bank i called them told them everything. Come Monday if status hasn't changed to shipped the bank is stopping the transaction.  Banks can do this but they dont like to and most charge to do it. 100% scam< /Review>

I placed an order on Feb 13, 2019 for an amp at a great price. Even received a confirmation email about my order. But per the email still have not received a follow up email with my tracking/shipping details and have tried 4 different methods of contacting this business and no response from any of the information they have listed via email or phone. I feel very unsettled about how this is going, so I have reached out to the BBB and hopefully I can get a response that way. This is the first time anything like this has happened to me via an online purchase and I hope this review helps anyone else in my same situation, please read reviews about a place before even considering making a purchase. Valuable lessons learned...< /review>

SAME experience as others stated in previous reviews (sadly only checked AFTER no communication from Car Audio Giants).  I ordered some JL Audio speakers on Aug 1st, 2019.  Received a payment confirmation and order confirmation and my debit card was certainly charged.  Was promised shipping info within 24-48 hours and here it is Aug 13th and I have ZERO communication back from this company.  PHONE is disconnected and NO reply to 4 different emails.

I ordered a PAC interface on 6/3/19. The Car Audio Giants website confirmed that it was in stock and promised a tracking number within 24-48 hours. After that time period elapsed, I reached out via email and phone to get an update. Come to find out that the phone number listed on their site was not in service and the vendor was not responsive via email. After several day of waiting for tracking info, I requested that the order be canceled. I receive an email later that day stating that the order was canceled because it was back-ordered with no ETA then the initial charge was reversed.  A week later the package showed up on my doorstep and my credit card had been charged again. Being that I had already ordered, received, and installed the PAC interface via a different vendor, I no longer needed this one. I have sent countless emails to the vendor requesting an RMA and pre-paid return shipping label but haven't gotten a response. I have since filed a dispute with my Credit Card company and will be filing a complaint with the BBB.< /text>

Placed an order. Was supposed to be emailed within 48 hours about status. Never received an email. Tried to call and cancel but customer service phone number was "no longer receiving calls due to high call volume". I called again at least 20 times and received the same message. Sent 3 emails to support and still no response. I would not recommend this retailer.<//review>

Absolute worst pos company i have ever dealt with   If i treated my custormers this way i would be out of business.  Been over two weeks.  No follow emails. No product. Zero replies from numerous emails and wont answer calls.  They advertise a small savings but do not deliver.  Dont waste your time or money with this company</Review>

<text>Yes, they have a lot of audio items at cheaper prices. No, they will not respond to your emails asking where your items are. No, you do not get current/updates info on your order, shipment wise, just a note that says "label created".

I purchased a Pioneer AVIC-7201NEX 8/20/2018 and received an immediate auto reply confirming my order.  Also stated in this reply tracking information would be sent within 24-48 hours.  8/23/2018 I received no tracking information.  I called to inquire about my order.  Message stated due to high call volume, they were not accepting any calls and to try back later or email.  I emailed them 8/23/2018 12:38 PM with a copy of my invoice.  I finally received a reply 8/24/2018 5:22  PM stating the unit I purchased was on back order, no time frame given, just the options to wait or cancel.   I canceled my order, I do not care to wait indefinitely nor am I comfortable with the lack of customer service and the inability to contact them by phone.  It's understandable a product is not available, however, it should be reasonable to communicate this in a timely fashion.</Text>

DO NOT BUY FROM THEM! Purchased a AV-Nex7200 from them. Got it fast and cheaply. 3 months later, the screen on the unit went bad. Got an RMA from them, sent it back, and it has been months with no info. They do not answer their phones, or emails. Do not purchase from them. Will be filling a complaint with the BBB.

Edit: Wound up randomly getting the head unit back from them fixed just recently.</Text>

Fast Shipping is actually Fast Handling. Deceiving in the advertisement to lure you to buy. The shipping was a snail pace USPS.  The product was accurate and was comparable in price.<//Text>

Next day, was wondering why I hadn't received the tracking information.   Called and found out then that the item was back ordered and wouldn't ship till the following week.   Don't know why I wasn't told that when I originally called.

<review>Don't buy here unless you are ABSOLUTELY sure that what you are ordering will work.  They do offer returns, but kill you on restocking fees. I have now spent $60 in return shipping for two different speaker sets that ended up not fitting my doors.  I spent another $68 in restocking fees.  So $128 total in fees and shipping to send them back merchandise that is in new unused condition.  Crazy.< /review><pictures>None</pictures>< rating>

<text>Like others said not good people to work with. On the direct advice of their salesman ordered something that didn't fit my truck. Tried to return it and buy more expensive speakers (extra ($400) but it was just over 30 days and they would allow absolutely no exchange for partial credit or anything. And that is with speakers that had never been out of the box yet. My install guy looked at the box and knew it wouldn't fit so they were never even opened, Spend the extra $10 and deal with a company that values customers.< /text><pics>None< /pics>< response>

<text>DO NOT PURCHASE ANYTHING FROM CAR AUDIO GIANTS!!!

I ordered a new car stereo and what I received was a correct box, but an incorrect, used stereo inside.  CAG demanded a 35% restocking fee if I wanted to return it.  Once I FedEx'd it back, they denied they received it back.
Had to get Discover involved to get my money back.  (FedEx had copy of signature when returned)

READ THEIR FINE PRINT.  If you can find it on their web site.< /text>< name>

<Text>Business not backing warranty of a $225 amplifier purchased by my sons hard earned internship money.  Unbeknownst to us that they sent a different model in 2015 upon purchase but now Car Audio Giants claims it was not sold by them.  Seriously,  this company is VERY dishonest & we learned that this business is NOT covered by BBB.  Will not make any future purchases from this company.< /Text><GmapID>0x80dcaccfc7126055:0xf148a80067f83443<//GmapID>< user_name>

Wouldn't let me return the item because it was missing a part, which made me laugh because yea obviously it's missing a part because that's how they sent it!  Car audio giants offered no resolution to this problem after I paid $199.00 for the stereo.  Yea, they have slightly cheaper equipment, but beware, they are a terrible business and will not help you if something is wrong.< /Text></record>

I ordered nearly $1000.00 of JL Audio marine component speakers form Car Audio Giants. While opening, I noticed the factory seal on one box had been cut. One of the tweeters from that box had a major defect. I emailed pictures and asked if they would replace only the tweeter to save on shipping cost and help with a timely install. They responded “We can diffidently help you. Please send us the tweeter and we will defiantly exchange it for you”. Now when I call they give me the run around, refuse to give their names and ignore my emails. Also notice The Google street view of this business is an ABANDONED MINUTE MART and the only positive reviews sound more like an ad then a real review.DO NOT DEAL WITH THIS BUSINESS!!!!!!!!!!@!!</review>< rating>

Great customer service, fast and free shipping, and unbelievably awesome prices!

I recently purchased a pioneer touch screen stereo for my chrysler 300 and got an unbelievable deal on a great product.  The product was also backed up by a 3 year warranty!  I was also able to save lots of money by purchasing the installation components through car audio giants rather than buying them through a stereo installation company.  I saved lots of  money that I can now use when I'm in vegas this summer baby wooo!!</text>

<text>Horrible experience will never order from them again. I ordered a flip screen head unit and xm module said was in stock called to double check before i ordered. Ordered then came up as possible fraud charge.  Send everything to get that fixed then they tell me my order is canceled because what i ordered was on backorder.then after my order was canceled they charged my card twice for the same purchase that they had already canceled.< /text>< Pictures>

I was on vacation in San Diego when my phone crashed. The screen went completely green and was inoperable. In a panic, I called SD Cell Phone Repair and was kindly assisted. The service repair was instant and affordable. I’m so thankful I was able to receive help in a timely manner. I highly recommend SD Cell Phone Repair!</Text>

<review>Fair prices and while I was in the owner turned away a customer and told her it would be cheaper to get a new phone rather than take her money which I thought was really decent of him. Recommended.</review>< pictures>

{'time': 1613441518376, 'text': 'Hi Shaun,\nI would like to start with an apology, I’m really sorry about your experience.\nUnfortunately mistakes happen in such business. This issue wasn’t explained to me accordingly by my new technician. He has a short term experience in customer service so please let me try to handle this situation fairly.\nI definitely understand your frustration which I agree with you 100%. I wouldn’t want to pay more than what was quoted to me especially when my device is not operating after my repair. My apologies on behalf of my company and my employees. I should have handled the situation from the beginning. We shouldn’t have charged you extra for the replacement, we should have only charged $70 as quoted. Since you are not happy with the service and the phone I would like to resolve this issue with you. I would like to give you a refund first of all. If you are not happy with the device I can try to get another device or if you want a newer device than the 6s, we can always come up with some sort of solution.\nLet me know how I can help to make sure you are satisfied with the service.\nThanks!'}< /Resp>
<text>***UPDATE***

Aydn responded to me immediately, sent me a FULL refund (immediately), and even offered a new replacement phone at a model newer than my original 6s (which wasn’t necessary but much appreciated).

I walk away a satisfied customer, and consider this matter more than resolved.

Thank you Aydn!

--

PLEASE BEWARE.  DO NOT GIVE THESE PEOPLE YOUR PHONE.

VERY SHORT SUMMARY:

They took my phone, broke it permanently, and then charged me $130 for a replacement phone.

In no way am I exaggerating.

——————————

MORE DETAILS:

—my iPhone 6s had two small cracks in it. it had been working with the two cracks for multiple years without a problem.

—they quoted me $75 to fix and 15-20 min.

—20 min later - a piece broke off when they were attempting to fix the phone (IE they broke part of the phone), it would now be $140 to fix. and they’d have to drive the phone to their other location to fix.

—FOUR DAYS pass. they let me know the phone is permanently broken. I’d need to pay them $140 for a replacement phone.

—I plead with them to cut me break on pricing, and we’ll split the difference, and I’ll pay the originally quoted $75.

—they refuse, best they can do is take $20 off.

—three additional days pass, the replacement phone is ready. it’s dirty. I pay $130 in total (only $10 off) to get a replacement 6s.

—(to compare - if I wanted any replacement 6s you can buy one on eBay fully loaded for $50-$70)

——————————

FULL BREAKDOWN

FRI 2/5
—quoted $70 for broken screen of iPhone 6s.

—hand over phone around 1130am-12pm - am told 15-20 min.

—20 min - am told a piece broke off when attempting to fix the phone, phone needs to be driven to their second location for a technician to investigate - should be an hr to fix.

—60 min - receive a call, need more time to diagnose.

—more time passes - another call, the phone needs more work than expected, cost is now $140, they’ll call back with an ETA

—6pm-6pm - another call, technician is backed up, they’ll need to charge me more to move the phone to the front of the line. I decline, they’ll call me back with an ETA.

SAT 2/6
—no call

SUN 2/7
—no call

MON 2/8
—no call

—2pm - I finally call for an update, they’ll call the technician right now and get back to me with an ETA

—no call

TUES 2/9
—no call

—1pm - I finally call for an update, it’s his day off, but he’ll call the technician now
—receive a call back - the phone needs more work than expected, it may be broken beyond the point of repair, they’ll find out

—receive a call back - the phone’s broken beyond the point of repair, here’s how that call went

THEM: I’m very sorry, but the phone’s broken and we can’t fix it
ME: what’s the next course of action?
THEM: what do you mean? we can’t fix the phone. that’s it.
ME: I gave you my working phone and it’s now broken. there needs to be some sort of recourse.
THEM: I’ll call you back

—receive a call back - they’ll replace my broken phone with a working 6s, they’ll get back to me with an ETA

WED 2/10
—receive a text - “what’s my phone’s carrier,” I respond

—no update

THURS 2/11
—receive a text - replacement is almost ready, they’ll need to charge me the full $140

—I respond - you guys broke my phone, and I’ve been without a phone for 6 days, I can get a fully loaded working 6s online for $70, can you please work with me here? let’s split the difference and I’ll pay $70.

—response - best they can do is knock off $20, their technician needs to get paid for his time, they’ll personally drop the phone off to me tonight
—I respond - unbelievable you’re still looking to make a profit off of all of this, no need to drop it off, I’ll pick it up tomorrow

—I respond again - re-state my case, essentially pleading for a discount. I now desperately need a phone, and can’t wait the time to buy a fully loaded working 6s online for $70. they have me over a barrel.

—response - he’ll ask his boss again.</text>< GmapID>

<review>SD Cell Phone Repair was both friendly and fast. I had a complicated situation where I needed to combine parts from two different i Phones to get one that worked, while also needed a new screen. They were very accommodating and I now have my phone back in working order. Am very satisfied with their service.<//review>< Name>

<review>I called to make an appointment and the owner let me know he closed his store front location last week. He told me he had a mobile office and he would meet me wherever I felt comfortable. He came to my house a few hours later, pulled up in my driveway and had my brand new screen on my iPhone X in about 20 minutes, for $165. Meanwhile, I got to eat my dinner and enjoy my evening. AMAZING!

Tim was extremely helpful and honest. Recently someone stepped on my not so durable Galaxy s10 plus phone and called this location for an estimate to repair.

I knew being a new model and phone not many places would be familiar with it.

Tim answered with amazing energy and heard me out and said he could fix but also recommended some alternatives to getting it fixed. Thanks a million Tim! We'll cross paths one day again!</review>

<text>SD came fast and he's friendly on time and super professional! I'm an elite yelper and even I think this is the best customer service I've ever seen. I have 3 dogs all of them just stopped barking because they trusted Jacob! Came, fixed my iPhone and all done with repair in less then 15 minutes! FAST AFFORDABLE AND in my opinion, best in San Diego for all SD Cell Phone Repair out there!<//text><userid>112392830720014599615< /userid><user_name>Bruce Mitchell<//user_name>< response>

High energy, hungry to help solve issues, predicts future issues, high quality products   and services at competitive prices. Genuinely a good, hard working man doing his part to fix most issues on cell phones. We need more people like him to help make the world go round efficiently. His little display of old phones is pretty cool too. Thanks 🙏🏼<//text>

I had a GREAT experience with Tim today, he repaired my cell phone and I paid much less than the competition was asking, and I called around for hours to get the right deal. I paid $100 less than i originally planned to pay. Tim is super knowledgable and WANTS to save you money, so there are options. I would most definitely refer anyone to him,  hes super friendly and my phone was repaired in 45 minutes! You MUST go to guy, you wont regret it!</Text>

It was difficult to find someone to work on my essential phone, but they were willing. They ordered the part and got it fixed. Gave me some knowledge about the phone. Very friendly and knowledgeable staff. I will definitely get more work done here.< /Review>

<rating>5< /rating><text>I went into SD Cell Phone Repair on a holiday with a dead phone. The owner explained the charging port goes frequently on the Samsung 6. He cleaned it out, charged it, and then sent me happily on my way 20 minutes later. He didn't charge me a penny. This review is a thank you for saving me today. I literally can't log into work without my phone and that was just very nice.<//text>< Pictures>

<Text>Tim is the quintessence of transparency, honesty, and customer empathy! Tim went out of his way to figure out the best, most cost-efficient solution for my repair, which was not easy for him because my phone isn't a common model! He genuinely cared about me as a customer, and he informed me about the cost breakdown at every step of the way. Moreover, Tim finished the repair even sooner than his estimated pick-up day, AND he charged 50 percent less than the last place I went for a repair (a place which I won't name, but it doesn't matter because everyone should just go to Tim!). SD Cell Phone Repair is the absolute best, and I would recommend Tim's business to ANYONE and EVERYONE.<//Text><username>Charissa Noble</username>< rate>

Phone screen cracked. Stopped by without an appointment  and Tim had It fixed with a new screen in 20mins. It works perfectly and I had hardly any downtime in my busy day. Plus he’s also a fun guy to chat with. Highly recommend him and SD cell phone Repair.<//text>

<Text>I am also apart of Steve's fan club. He was such a great help in replacing the screen on my iPhone. It was like magic watching him replace it right before my very eyes and the price is RIGHT. Steve was super cool and very friendly. I am so glad I decided to give him a try. I highly recommend him :-)<//Text></record>

<review>Amazing. I took my phone in because another company didn't glue my screen on right until it started coming off. I came here and the prices are amazing. Customer service is great. Time flew for me as I saw him repair my phone, quality work done fast. He's a very honest and straight forward guy, friendly with a great talking personality. You just know he will do an amazing job. He left my phone looking brand new with a great screen. Hopefully I'll never break my screen again, but if I was to, I'd definitely come back here and i definitely recommend this place.<//review>< pics>

<text>terrible customer service, repair wait times are basically next day or day after, even if they tell you that it will be a couple hours, had to go back in to get my phone fixed after i paid to fix it, then was charged again to go back in because they didnt fix it the first time and couldnt be any more less satisfied. there are other places way better than here and i will go there for now on.< /text><resp>None<//resp>< Pictures>

<Review>Tim does fantastic (and fast) work! I was in for a phone screen repair and was out the door fixed again in under an hour. From seeing his interaction with customers you can tell he genuinely wants to help people out and will work hard to solve your problem whatever it may be. Would recommend highly and would go back again if I needed more work done.< /Review>< pics>

<Review>THESE GUYS DESERVE 10 STARS ! COME HERE WITH YOUR BROKEN DEVICE BEFORE TAKING TO YOUR CELL PHONE PROVIDER IF YOU WANT TO SAVE TIME, MONEY AND AGGRAVATION ! After jumping through hoops with my cellphone company and the insurance company that I've been paying premiums to for 9 years (still no replacement device  after a week) I googled "San Diego cell phone repair" hoping  to retrieve contacts from my dead device that wouldn't charge.

UN-BELIEVABLY FANTASTIC SERVICE !!!!!  .... BEST DECISION I EVER  MADE WAS TAKING MY DEVICE HERE ! .... THANK YOU !<//Review>< Resp>

<Text>5 well earned stars. Came in with a cracked iPhone 7. Tim repaired it on the spot for a great price ($99) out the door. Right as it was done I noticed the color of the screen was a litttttttle different. Super small picky detail which I could have lived with. He was so cool about it though that he insisted I come back the next day when he got a new shipment of screens to try another.

Personally called me the next day to let me know they got them and swapped it out. Next one was perfect.

Super friendly straight forward shop. Best customer service I’ve dealt with in a long time. Thanks guys 🤘🏼< /Text>< time>

<Text>Walked in at about 1 PM today to get my iPhone 5s and grandma's old 6s fixed. Tim gave me a quick diagnoses of both before replacing the cracked screen on my iPhone 5s and giving me an in-depth speculation as to the condition of the iPhone 6s. Engaged in pleasant conversation with Tim during the short wait to get my phone fixed and paid a very reasonable price afterwards. After he was finished, I left with a completely fixed and refurbished iPhone 5s and a smile on my face. Definitely coming back for any future phone mishaps I might encounter. Thanks for the great service Tim!</Text>< Pics>

<Text>I rarely write reviews and even rarer than that, I rarely write a GOOD review.  I am a business owner myself and I understand the importance of taking care of customers and going the extra mile.  Tim at SD Cell Phone Repair does exactly this.  Just all around good business tactics and I wish more businesses handled things the way he does.  Quality parts at excellent prices installed on my phone to get it working like new.  Thanks again Tim!< /Text>< pics>

I had a broken screen for my Motorola Droid Turbo, my phone has been broken for over a year. I bought the LCD screen replacement. I brought my phone into the shop, what the LCD screen replacement. The guy fixed the phone right away, took him a maximum of 15 minutes. The guy does really really good work.  Would highly recommend!!!<//text>

Out there to help and do a proper job, over the phone, was able to be patient, listen, discuss my current phone problem,  confirm the issue, and tell me it isn't worth it to repair, or deal with , and to purchase a new phone. Saved me a lot of time and potentially money. 10/10 would recommend< /review>

Replaced cracked screen on iPhone 6 Plus. Tim is a cool personable and funny guy who provides fast exceptional service at very fair prices.  If you don't have warranty or insurance this is hands-down your best option in San Diego!!  So glad I made this decision instead of going to the monopolistic corporate greed path.<//text>

< Review>
Guy talks allot but is funny, does good work and charges a fair price. He thought the fix was going to be 50 until I got in and he said the replacement part was not a thing he could get so he tried to bend back into place. Thought it was still gonna be 50 but he charged 10 for the work. My phone works great now.<//Review>

<Review>Made sure everything was functional and fair price on non-common phone (not iPhone).  Had initial issue with microphone, but made this a priority and fixed the issue immediately.  I could tell he knew what he was doing and I will for sure be back (when I break my next phone), but also recommend for anyone in the SD area.  Thank you my friend.<//Review>< Time>

So my phone screen broke a day before having to leave to NYC. I needed my screen repaired asap. Luckily the guys at SD Cell Phone Repair saved the day. They didn't have the parts to repair it, so they had to go out and pick them up. All and all, they were able to get the phone repaired in a few hours... just amazing! Their customer service is fantastic. Super nice guys.

I highly recommend using their services!</Text>

<text>I went to SD Cell Phone Repair and they did a great job.  First they checked out my phone with the cracked screen then they went over my screen options.  They replaced my screen. My phone looks good as new.   I recommend this company whole heartedly.

Went in to get my sister-in-laws phone fixed. Easily the best experience I've ever had a phone repair store. We were second in line and we only had to wait 30 min for the fix. 15 min for the person in from of us and then 15 for us. Easy, fast and enjoyable, best part, affordable. I'd recommend this to any and all people who have iPhones and need to get their screen fixed.</text>

Tim is a great guy - helpful and honest and quick with an answer. I've taken broken phones and tablets to him and the results are always great. Sometimes he tells me its not worth the cost to fix it, and I appreciate his honesty.< /Text>

Super friendly guys at SD Cell Phone Repair. They fixed my daughters older Sony  android phone. (charger port was damaged). Due to a completely drained battery they couldn't get it powered in the shop, but suggested I let it charge overnight. I did and it now works flawlessly and can be charged. I'll come back next time I have a broken phone. Thanks guys.</Review>

From the time you walk in the door you get the feeling that Tim is a great guy and that he is going to take care of you. I had an iPhone 6 screen that needed to be fixed and less than an hour later I was up and running. But during that hour I chatted with Tim and he shared great business advice as I watched literally 10 different customers walk through his door. Bottomline- Tim will fix your phone at a competitive rate within a short time frame and give you a great experience.<//Review>

This guy is great. Professional, courteous, engaging, and really genuinely concerned with ensuring that your cell phone is repaired effectively and efficiently, to your satisfaction. I've been to cell phone repair shops before (they're a dime a dozen and many of them seem kinda shady) but it was just a joy doing business at this place. I came in with a cracked iPhone 6s screen. He actually said he could fix my phone in just an hour (!) but *I* couldn't be back that quickly so I just picked it up the next day. And it works like new.</Review>

<review>I never write reviews. This is one exception. My wife dropped her Nexus 5 and the screen shattered. We get off work at 5pm and did a quick google search and saw 5 star review for the guys at SD Cell Phone Repair. We give Tim a call. He says he not only has the part in stock, but that if we make it by 6:15pm he will have it done same day. We drove from Sorrento Valley and made it just one time. The building was a little confusing, but we found the shop with little trouble. We were in and out in about 20 minutes. I was floored. Not only is the phone fully restored, it was done quickly. To top it all off, the guys there are awesome people. They chatted with us the entire time and are very personable! Would give more than 5 stars if I could. You guys just earned our loyalty!</review>< pictures>

<Text>Yet another great experience at SD Cell Phone Repair! I have a Samsung Galaxy S5 that found its way into a basin of Epsom Salts water that had been used for soaking my feet. I thought I got it out in time, but the next day it refused to accept a charge. No matter what I tried, it kept saying that I was using a bad charger, and that it was turning off the charge to protect the phone.

I took it to Tim's place, and I was amazed again at how he is unfailingly helpful and considerate to every person he interacts with. He did not charge me for getting my phone working again.

Thank you again, Tim. This is the second time you have saved my phone at no cost. I truly appreciate your approach to life and other people. I wish I could give you more stars, 5 is not enough.< /Text><Name>Ray Phoenix< /Name><Response>None< /Response><date>1471112399953</date>< gmap_id>

So Awesome!!!  This guy, Tim Clerkx, is so great.  I accidentally smashed my iPhone 6 screen when it fell to the cement floor face first.  I use my phone all day long for my shop and online Art and Handmade Natural Soap business (Artful Ruins), and I was out of commission without it.  I found SD Cell Phone Repair on Google Maps, called in, he say me right away and withing an hour I was back up an running.  Thank you so much for the quick fix.<//review>

These guys fixed my phone after I'd been shut down by other  places that are exclusive to specific models of phones and nonchalant about their business/caring about makin money or not  lol ~ Tim & Chris are awesome!! High quality service paired with appreciation and honest work ethic. While I certainly hope I don't need another repair soon I can only sing the praises of this place and highly recommend for ease and convenience.</Review>

I live in Santa Fe and got the runaround from the tech company in my town saying it would take two days.  I was flying to San Diego the next day and researched on the net, made an appointment to get a new glass and protector when i got my rental car and zoomed over there.  Tim and David kick butt and I was outta there in less than two hours and all was well.<//text>

<Text>Tim is the best! I tried to fix my Nexus 5 power button issue myself, but in the process ended up making the screen go blank. I took it to Tim who tried everything possible, but the phone was beyond repair. Only If I would have gone to Tim in the first place. Tim is an honest and skilled professional. I won't go anywhere else in the future. I would highly recommend Tim.< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Rating>5</Rating><userid>102053018769930927387<//userid></record></dataset><record>

<Review>The service was great! I called in beforehand because I was worried he wouldn't be able to fix my phone, since it's not that common(zte zmax pro), and he told me to take it in so he could take a look at it. I took it in not knowing what to expect, but he calmed all my fears and made me feel welcome with his friendly banter as he made quick work of fixing my phone(I dropped it and the volume up button was stuck pressed down as a result). Then, after having to take it completely apart to fix it, he refused to accept any payment, but just wished me well. Loved the service and would definitely come back if my phone ever broke again!<//Review></record></dataset><record>

I have never seen a client so kind and caring towards  his  customers needs. Met him for few mins when I took my phone in with a broken LCD screen  and I was out in an hour with a huge smile on my face. Treated me more like a friend than a mere new customer or stranger. Highly recommended forever!!!😊</review>

<Review>SD Cell Phone Repair has successfully fixed a number of my family's iPhones over the last several years - batteries, broken screens, bad buttons, and even water damage.  But, what pushed me to write this positive review was Tim, the owner's, phenomenal service.  After Tim was unable to replace my iPhone 5 screen because he ran out of that model screen due to a holiday rush, he hand delivered and installed it the following day.at my house.  You can't beat that kind of customer service.  I'll be going back.< /Review><UserId.>100464857427880359285<//UserId.>< Date>

Tim Clerkx is the best! I had a moto x gen 1 with a broken charging port. Tim is one of the few in the SD area with the skills to work on both iPhone and Android products. He was able to fix my phone in a timely manner and as promised, very friendly service! :-) Price is great - service is solid - & he has a pretty adorable accent.<//Review>

This place is awesome. The owner can fix almost any  thing, and so reasonably priced. Owner is really honest. Fixed my Samsung S3 last year with a broken power button, and wife's Moto X1 with a dead screen. Both phones still running great. I highly recommend this place to anyone with any iPhone or Android phones in need of a repair. If he can't fix it, or if it's not worth fixing, he'll let you know. Thanks!< /text>

This place is so awesome.  I took my friend here, who shattered the BACK of her iPhone 4. Everyone I called did NOT have this replacement part, or had no idea what I was talking about.  I called Tim the day before coming, and he said "no prob! $20 and 5 minutes, it'll be good as new." YAY!

The place was a little confusing to find - it is inside a building with a bunch of other business (tattoos, massages, accupuncture - a one stop shop!).  There was a nice man sitting on the couch at the entrance who seemed to know the layout well.  He directed us immediately to Suite 2.  The whole shop is basically a closet with a work desk and some parts up on the wall.  We walked in and he was about to assist one guest ahead of us, but had remembered me from calling the day before!  My friend handed her phone over, and Tim chatted with us while he did his magic.  It literally took one minute for him to finish the job.  We gave him the $20 and were on our way!

I recommend this place to everyone with phone troubles!  It seems like he also has some accessories for sale! THANKS TIM!<//text>

Tim is simply on point with phone repairs, especially all iPhone and Samsung.  Also quick and straight forward with the pricing, might be $5-$10 more than the other place, but then again you got to ask yourself, how much does your sanity and aggravation is worth?  $5?!?!<//Text>

Dropped my LG G2, phone was useless.  I called him up, he said he needed a day to get the new screen and digitizer, came by the next day and he fixed it while I waited.  Good dude that likes what he does and it shows in his work.  I will only go to this guy from now on.</Text>

<Rate>5</Rate><text>About 4 months ago my Galaxy S3's power port stopped working, and after calling around to a few places that said they can't fix it since the power port is attached to the main board, I found this place where I was told they could fix it.

I got to watch as my phone was disassembled, and talked to Tim as he worked on my phone about random stuff ranging from what he was doing to why I got in to computer science.  It was really great getting to watch him work as he explained to me what he was doing and showed me where the problem on the old part was.  He fixed my problem on the spot in about an hour and I walked out the door with a perfectly working phone.

Last week my phone had a different problem and I came back to Tim since he did such a great job with my first problem.  After taking my phone apart and chatting for about an hour or so, he was able to partially but not completely fix my problem.  Since he wasn't able to fully solve my problem he didn't charge me, though I insisted on paying for his time and the partial fix he was able to provide.

If anyone is in San Diego and their phone breaks, I would definitely send them over to SD Cell Phone Repair.  He definitely knows his stuff and it's nice to be able to chat with him while he's working.< /text>< Pictures>

<Text>Just came back from this place after being referred from another cell phone repair shop that is much, much closer to where I live. It was totally worth the trip; I cannot say enough good things about Tim, his friendliness, and his professionalism. He was able to quickly diagnose the problem that I had with the cell phone that I brought in (I couldn't get my new digitizer screen to work). After identifying the LCD connection as the problem (not the digitizer), he put in one of his own LCDs that happened to be laying around, and left it in, free of charge. He promptly fixed my phone back to "like-new" condition, all while teaching a nice old lady how to use a smartphone from scratch. Also while I was in his shop, Tim took a call from another guy who was trying to do-it-yourself repair his own phone, and answered many of his questions about the process. After doing some quick research on parts, he advised the guy that replacing his phone would overall be more cost-effective to him than repairing it due to the parts being expensive for that particular model. Tim's prices are extremely competitive, and I couldn't be happier with the service. A+ business, and A+ human being.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

<review>Tim over at San Diego Cell Phone Repair was a great host. He fixed my cell phone Samsung Galaxy in about 1 hour. It had a broken LCD and even though I could still see the screen, it wasn't working right anymore. After the screen was repaired, everything worked as normal. Thanks Tim.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

<review>I was referred to this gentleman who I found to be very knowledgeable and knows a lot about cell phone troubleshooting.  My samsung galaxy s3 was having problems when I tried to charge it and I had to jiggle the USB cord to get it right and start charging. TIM took  a quick peek under the microscope and quickly diagnosed the problem to be a couple of loose connection pins. I said that if he had to replace the whole USB power port to go ahead and do it and he was honest enough to tell me that a simple soldering job with fix it. In and out in 5 minutes. I am glad there are still people in this world who are honest and hard working. I had gone to the cricket store where I bought the phone and all they wanted me to do was to upgrade to the s4. Save your hard earned money and go to Tim so he can salvage your good ol reliable phone.  Thanks again Tim.<//review><rate>5<//rate>< user>

Nice front desk staff.

Lovely doorman

Easy access to find parking which is seriously 300feet away from the building. AND reasonably priced garage for a 35 dollar a day.< /text>< pictures>

Good location in the financial district.  Decent area.  Nice room.  Nice view from our 21st floor room.  Because of Covid, there was no housekeeping service during our stay.  I like my bed made in the morning so I made it myself.  But the bedding was messy...lumpy comforter made it hard to make the bed.  I miss housekeeping service. ☹️< /review>

Due to COVID restrictions the room was not serviced and the restaurant was only open for in room dining with a $30 breakfast (after adding delivery and service charges). But it’s a wonderful hotel with a great location and friendly staff. Our favorite in San Francisco.2<//review>

The customer service and location of this wonderful hotel was fantastic. Stayed for the weekend and had room service breakfast. We ordered corned beef hash and super omelet with swiss cheese, sausage and spinach. It was made fresh, very fast, and it was surprisingly affordable!!! The front door concierge made our stay obsolete by allowing us to park in the front with no extra charge. I would definitely reccomend anyone to book a stay at this fabulous sf hotel.<//text>

We were given a room with a seal on the door saying COVID safe.  However, the room had not been cleaned from the previous guests as towels were on the floor and the bed was not made! Ugh!<//Text>

Amazing views of the city! Loved our patio area to have our coffee in the morning and Cali cabernet in the evening. The view of the bay bridge was stunning. The bed was so comfortable, we actually would love to know the kind of pillows used so we can buy some! The staff was so accomodating with our early check in and holding our bags after check out so we could walk the city before our flight out. I was especially impressed with how clean the bathroom was in our room. Just wished the bar was open for us a little later but everything in town seemed to close a little early due to covid. Also, really wanted to enjoy room service but with all the fees it was more beneficial to just walk down the street for some food. Other than that, highly recommend! And again, would love to know what kind of pillows were in those rooms!</text>

Positive: Hotel was in the middl of a closed financial district.... Negative: Don¿t get me started. I booked this hotel since asa five star hotel it would have a valet and parking. As we pulled into valet, we were told valet was closed as was hotel parking. We were directed with all our bags to PUBLIC PARKING! TOTALLY UNNACEPTABLE</Text>

Top notch service everytime i go see a friend. I hope to stay there sometime in the future and will inquire if they offer a reduced rate for essential workers. It's nice to find a relaxing space after my shift as a caregiver and it's location is close to work.< /review>

<Text>No fitted sheets, a disgusting amount of hair and trash in floor outlet, broken drawers, bad water pressure, and extremely rude service man. Parking across street, 35$ over night, no last min charges, but our room lacked amenities we were promised. No in-room massage as listed, no mini bar, and of course no fitted sheet. Toilet worked for the trip then began making a running water noise and wouldn’t flush. Long story short, the service guy who came up tried saying we broke their toilets pressurized system and that he is going to need to rip out the whole toilet. Toilet was fine. Sure I’m not expecting the same customer service from him as the doorman, however there’s still an expectation of mutual respect between strangers.<//Text>< pics>

<text>The room was amazing. Spacious, clean and so well kept. The bed was so comfortable and the sheets were so soft. The best thing I love about my room was the view of Bay Bridge at night with the fairy lights turned on. Front desk was very friendly and helpful. If you don't  mind walking, the location is walking distance to a lot of retail stores. Love it! Too bad I only  got to stay there for 2 nights.</text><rating>5< /rating><UserId.>118087492999557768653<//UserId.><Name>Arynne Zainal</Name></record></dataset><record>

This is arguably one of the nicest all around hotels I've ever stayed at. The location is fantastic and we had a great view of the Bay and the city from our room. It's walking distance to tons of restaurants and the Ferry Building along the Embarcadero. Service was amazing and we received free drinks and breakfast because it was our anniversary! The room was spacious and well appointed. Everything seemed cleaned and well taken care of. I can't recommend this hotel enough!<//text>

The room that was provided to me was NOTHING like the pictures on hotels.com.  It was disgusting and WAY overpriced considering the room.  This room looked like furniture from a frat house.  If I had enough time I would have packed my things, demanded a refund and booked another hotel.  Needless to say I will NEVER stay at this hotel again.< /review>

<username>Nate Hohenstreet< /username><review>Just like the city around this hotel, Le Meridien was a very welcoming and enjoyable place to stay. From the moment of arrival, the appearance and amenities are subtly extravagant. It was refreshing to have the luxury feel that didn't rely on gaudy marble or accents. A comfortable and modern lobby and lounge provided a great place for relaxing, meeting up with others, and just enjoying conversation. The attendants at the front desk were prompt, professional, and welcoming.

The Concierge deserves their own special mention. What began as a requested recommendation for restaurants, resulted in an amazing evening and memorable dinner without a single hassle. Ben offered dining options, handled the reservations for us, provided directions, and then the restaurant treated us as VIPs simply because Le Meridien had set up our reservation!

Our accommodations were immaculate! Well furnished, very clean, beautiful views, extremely quiet, and a very comfortable bed! It was a memorable stay.

No matter when or why I travel to the Bay Area in the future, this centrally located hotel will be our destination.< /review><rate>5<//rate></record></dataset><record>

Modern, upscale hotel. Great for business or leasure, it's right in the financial district with lots of bars and restaurants within walking distance. The bar in the hotel is great as well. Rooms are spacious and modern. Lots of plugs and extra seating for work or chilling, along with a large TV and big bathroom. Definitely recommend this place.< /review>

The room is pretty cool with a nice view of the city. I think I know that they are trying to be as cool as the city. Bed is comfy and the bathroom is big. My problem is.. why should I pay for WiFi?? That's very essential, I guess.< /text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMfRDHNLhDFbo7eeKHtG-82c9j5qABaYXhDPUZa=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPF2vGDFdkZdMCYNG49BqtrGucpo-nnuSVzQ880=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO2WTWrQRLPxyhdZifREb6b8BicUz2Q1ISxbZhV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNIQNoAxd2syW9ZOKveu0yLP_NYTCR66tXjh1df=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNdInpn_-7YarIW2bohu_zeZWRUTKg6JSQg9Ys_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPakDCOH0W3bl_OaQCuvmllZ5CxXAwxf21DxKew=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOlvK1x5JQlKerhByCCqgcF4D-0n46R8ugDa1bz=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOiQ43knbRmJx1NZsoL9Q0FUQ4kyNHPVERvddRz=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures><resp>None< /resp><Gmap_id>0x8085806033e06771:0x5585cb03086b5f0f</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<review>For many years now I have had the honor of hosted by the staff at Le Meridien.  Always consistently a great experience from check in to check out. They make everything looks easy and with a smile. Love the coffee in the morning and fantastic selection of newspapers. The property is well taken care of, staff ever so helpful and friendly, location awesome. It makes me happy to write a review for them after all these years of great experiences.</review>< pictures>

Wow! Color me impressed!

Our company had an event in San Francisco  and we had reservations, via the company, here at Le Meridien.

I had my printed reservation paperwork and it wasn't even needed. Miss Laura just asked for my ID, Credit Card info and to verify my phone number. Everything started out smooth.

I headed to my assigned room and the cleaning lady informed me that it wasn't quite ready yet. So I just went back to the desk and let Miss Laura know that I would be back. I'd grab some food and then go to my room. After some clarity, she just made arrangements for a different room.

The customer service here is awesome. Then again, I wasn't screaming or yelling that there was any kind of an issue. 😉

So if you are in the area or if your company wants to plan an event, reach out to Le Meridien and stay a night or two.

As a side note for those who like to sight see, Le Meriden is located less than half a mile from the Exploratorium, with restaurants, bars and shops all around. A little farther down the road and you have pier 39. Come one, come all and let Le Meridien take care of your weekend. (And/or business trip.)</Text>

The lobby/rooms were quite nice and up to date contrary to the exterior of the hotel, as a gold member I was upgraded to a Bay view room and thoroughly enjoyed my stay, there aren't any swimming pools here.  The Montgomery Bart station is walking distance as is the pier.  The entrance is on Clay street and not on Battery street in case of transportation instructions.  The room was nice although there wasn't a master switch for the whole room, so after turning on all the lights, you'd need to go one by one to turn everything off.  The bathroom although large, is a little dated and could use some remodeling to match the rest of the hotel. The bathroom products by MALIN+GOETZ were nice. There is free Illy coffee in the 3rd floor and a Starbucks across the street.< /Text>

Great hotel with memorable customer service. Chief concierge Laura Fairbanks made my newlywed accommodations amazing. From the cheese plate, to the sparkling wine, it was perfect. Would highly recommend for great service, rooms and quality.< /review>

Kevin at the front desk is awesome! He has helped us twice and both times he gave us an awesome room with a great view! I love the hotel! I think I can say this one is my favorite! My husband and I travel a lot and this hotel seems so clean compared to others!  We come here to celebrate every bday and anniversary! The last time we were here they sent cheese and wine to our room! I highly recommended this hotel! Great views and great service!< /review>

The staff were incredible and polite, so no problems there. The hotel location was perfectly positioned in the financial district, which allowed easy access to a majority of the things we wanted to do. However, the hotel was a little dated. It didn't have a smart TV like most Marriott hotels and the interior color scheme, blinds, and furniture were cool ten years ago. Overall, the service was impeccable but the rooms were not to our taste. My wife and I would visit again if the cost or accommodations were adjusted to be representative of each other.</Text>

<Review>I stay here whenever I can! The decor is very pretty and the bar/restaurant downstairs never disappoints. It can get a bit crowded with 40 and over crowd though on a Friday night. The rooms are usually great. The only time I had an issue was when the housekeeper missed an entire bag of McDonalds behind the curtain. Who eats McDonald's when you're at this place anyway? The beds and pillows are very comfortable and clean. The location can't be beat since you're at the Embarcadero Center and a 40-50 minute walk or so (speed varies!) from Pier 39 and Fisherman's Wharf.<//Review>< Pics>

The parking is ridiculously expensive. Park a few blocks away at the St. Mary's garage. It is cheaper and not far. The staff was great. The one gal at the front desk got me a table on new years eve for dinner when nothing was available! There is parking at the meters outside the bldg at night for free. Check times and street signs. Safeway is not far and lots of dinning close by. You can walk to fisherman's wharf if you want and the pier is just blocks away. My room had a balcony overlooking the bay.</text><date>1518367300575<//date></record>

<rate>None<//rate><review>Picked Le Meridien based on location for a quick stay in the city - close to restaurants, walkable to Chinatown, Columbus, Downtown and the Embarcadero. Hotel feels brand new and totally up to date. Every member of staff we interacted with was efficient and friendly - even the room staff we passed in the corridor were a treat. The room and view were stunning and the Illy coffee and Eclairs are indulgent but worth it. Lots of Bonvoy hotels to chose from in San Francisco but Le Meridien will be our first choice.< /review>< Pictures>

Large rooms by San Francisco standards and right in the centre of town a quick walk to the Embarcadero Center. The staff were very helpful.< /Review>

It was the first NYE for my girlfriend and I to spend together.  We decided to spend it in SF and when we pulled up we were greeted by very friendly staff that took our bags and valet our car.  We escorted in and given a very warm welcome by the front desk.  Chris at the front desk was very accommodating and gave us a beautiful room over looking the port (where we later watched the fireworks from our room).  Our bellman brought up all of our luggage and hung up our clothes in the closet for us.  Top notch service by a very friendly staff.  We will definitely be coming back to stay again.  Thank you Le Meridien and the entire staff for making our stay so memorable.</Text>

the front desk crew was cold.. It was like speaking to robots.. If Marriott does not care about customers feeling welcomed.. they could save them selves some extra money and put Self check in computers.. Im sure is a better experience than dealing with people that give u the vibe that hate their jobs...
Everything else was great! And you know you do not have to deal with the front desk other than to check in and check out... So do not worry to
Much about it.. and again they are very professional... just not service oriented for an expensive hotel...< /review>

Le Meridien is a fabulous hotel to stay in.
Although targeted at the business market we were a family on holiday and found the hotel met our needs perfectly.
It was quiet at night and walking distance to China town and the Italian restaurants in North Beach.
Not too far either to Fishermans Wharfe and Union Square.
Rooms were wonderful and beds were very comfy.
If you want a view ask for a room with City View.<//Text>

Spend two nights at Le Meridien San Francisco with my three children. We were welcomed with a smile even at 2AM in the morning, the Director of Sales ensured to surprised us with a nice bowl of fruit which was perfect after such a long flight.   The location of the hotel is excellent whether on business or leisure. Every single of the staff members were courteous and helpful throughout our stay. My kids had an amazing time. EXCELLENT HOTEL AND AMAZING SERVICE< /Review>

OUTSTANDING CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!! The desk clerks and maids were simply stellar. They made our stay most enjoyable.  The chocolates and rose they handed out on Valentine's day was a nice touch that no other hotel has ever done, thank you Le Meridien for making your customers feel like family. So rare ......a true gem. Love, love, love this hotel.........the staff always goes above and beyond!!!<//Text>

I dont think I would stay here again. Daisy at the front desk was not helpful. The rooms are big and updated but the service was not great. The breakfast is pretty bad and the bar service was not good either. The location is the best part but wouldn't recommend staying here.</text>

The room is nice and the staff courteous. The mini fridge is stacked. The bathroom is generous. The view leaves something to be desired, but honestly not looking out the window while I am here. Basic cable package for the TV, and if you are not a member of the hotel, internet is $20 a day.</review>

Nice people and I found the bed and the room very comfortable. One night cost $467 inc. valet parking, which alone cost $80, and not a secure garage so I had to haul in all my tech valuables. The location is good and central. The styling of this hotel is choppy and incongruent but no biggie. No executive lounge.</review>

< Review>
Great hotel and location but the staff is costing them to loose and credibility as a top tier hotel. It’s troubling that a hotel with a past littered with red flags would allow those stuck in the mud to continue to hold them down. A few members of the team stand out as enjoyable, but many have bad attitudes and lack desire to be in the hospitality industry.
The two pics of the light are a before and after from when I arrived and I cleaned it appropriately.< /Review>

Great hotel and wonderful views. Had to wait over an hour to get some water delivered to the room and wouldn't let me come down and pick it up after I had waited 30 min. So that wasn't ideal, but the staff was friendly and helped suggest some good places to eat during our stay.<//review>

< Review>
The hotel was modern.  We liked the coffee and juice shots on the 3rd floor when we got up in the morning.  The beds were super comfortable as were the pillows.  Our fridge was SUPER STOCKED with everything, so much so we had to empty it to fit our fridge stuff in there!!  The bathrooms were a nice size and the amenities were what we needed.  We also liked the location - it was handy and right where we needed to be downtown.  We walked almost everywhere!</Review>

Great location close to public transit (Muni bus stop across the street and Muni train station just under half a mile). Helpful staff. Easy and quick check-in/even easier and faster check-out. Clean room/bathroom. Worth joining Marriott rewards for free internet service. Would stay here again and would recommend to others!<//review>

For how much you pay, you are going to pay more for every little thing.  No real amenities over a regular motel.  Save your money.  We were told at check in there was water and coffee available.  Went down to the floor where it was located and was rudely told (in front of other people!) that I could "pay for it downstairs" if I really wanted coffee!  How embarrassing!< /text>

Le Méridien is our new Hotel in the Bay! It's perfectly located to everything we want to do and within walking distance. We had a great city view with the Bay Bridge in the background. Our room was stocked with snacks, beer and liquor. It had one of the most comfortable beds I ever slept in. The pillows were very comfortable also, which is a rarity for us. It had a safe to keep your valuables. See you again soon!<//review>

<pics>None< /pics><review>Solid hotel with fairly neat decor (maps on the walls- subtle!) and a convenient location to both the Ferry Building and Chinatown-- although to be fair it's a few block's walk to both places.

Views from the upper floors are terrific, and service is pretty good... as you'd expect for the price. Which, speaking of, considering how $$$ the whole area is, it's almost justifiable.<//review><response>None< /response></record>

<date>1572912000000</date><review>Built in 1989 and opened just months after the Loma Prieta earthquake this architectural juggernaut has suffered only a bit being forever overshadowed by the iconic San Francisco trans America pyramid. Like Oakland standing on the shadow of the glittering big sister princess SF, Le Méridien would ne called handsome to the beauty of the one of a kind pyramid. But don’t let the painfully obvious distract you. Look deeper within the Marriott international’s le Méridien. I try to book a high floor queen suite with the in the 19 stack. On the Highest floors the views from the almost industry wide specialty feature: a balcony with seating!! Are postcard ready. What do you say when you write back home and talk about the special place in history sf will always have?  To see it is to believe it. Go on and splurge a little. After all, you can’t take it with you, except in digital format.< /review>< Rate>

My studio suite was beautiful and spacious with a perfect view of the city and the Bay. Amenities abound in this hotel from your room to the fitness center. It’s all in the details and in the big picture as well.

The consistency of service and warm, professional attitudes across the staff is what sets Le Meridien apart, in my opinion. 

Enjoy your stay! I’ll be returning soon.< /Text><Response>None</Response><Pictures>None<//Pictures></record>

We chose Le Meridien as our 11th-anniversary accommodations because it seemed to have a great price for the location and considering it is a 4-star hotel. We were not disappointed. Check-in was so easy and the staff was so helpful. We were impressed with the chic design of the bar, lobby and other areas. We were upgraded to a suite because of our anniversary and we had every accommodation at our fingertips. The smallest touches make the difference, as seeing the genuine smiles on the doormen each time they opened the door was priceless. Our view was spectacular! The Lotus structure at the Embarcadero Center and the Bay Bridge lit up were amazing. Not to mention it was central to BART and our restaurant. So much within walking distance.<//text>

They are not clear about there policy during check-in. They leave lots of snacks and liquor in the room but do not tell you if it's complementary and later charge a very high amount. Room was clean and had a nice view.</text>

Le Meridien is a great place to be when visiting San Francisco. Its location is ideal, with restaurants, transportation and scenic spots within a few steps away.  The rooms are comfortable and updated. The lobby staff is friendly and helpful. It’s a great place to come back to after a busy day in the city.</review>

<Text>Very nice hotel, nice staff, well appointed rooms. However for a luxury hotel, it was severely lacking in accommodations. In a hotel of this caliber, I would expect 24 hour room service. I would also expect a spa with massages and such. It had neither of these.< /Text>< Pics>

This hotel is in a great location (in the financial district) and is accessible to lots of dining options (including the Little Italy neighborhood), transit (a block or two from the cable car), and various entertainment, coffee shops, etc. The valet service is a bit slow upon check in but the other staff were very kind and helpful. Definitely recommend the Bay view rooms! Beautiful view.</review>

True story, My car was broken in during my travel in SF with my family. Everything was stolen including passport, ID and hotel room card. When we came back to hotel with bare hands, the hotel staffs gave me a new room card without asking for my ID.
It might be just a little help, but it’s a little light for someone just lost everything during his travel. At least we got a place to sleep during that night. And the next day we reached out to consulate and made it back home.

Really appreciate the help from the staffs. And dont park your car with valuable things inside at SF. Especially in Japan town.<//review>

I researched hotels for quite some time before settling on Le Meridien, and so happy I did. I couldn't have asked for a better stay. The staff, the room, the comfort of the bed, the views, the helpfulness, the cleanliness...all of it was really great. Will definitely be staying here on my visits to San Fran.</text>

I received the free WiFi after they got me to sign up for Marriott Bonvoy.

I did all the steps they told me at the front desk. I never got WiFi for my phone. I eventually got WiFi for my laptop BUT every three minutes, the WiFi would stop working. I would have to disconnect and reconnect the WiFi. Every three minutes. That was for my room. The WiFi in the lobby was horrible too.

I was in San Francisco on a business trip, and I couldn't get any work done in my hotel due to the WiFi.

I had to leave my hotel room to find some WiFi when I needed to get some work done.

You won't see me here again.< /text>

< review>
My family stayed at Le Meridien for the weekend as we were attending a family wedding next door.  We had two rooms, one which was not ready at arrival but was ready within the hour.  My son arrived straight from the airport and had to immediately connect to the internet to take a college final and the internet was fine, no problems.  The rooms were clean, large and well laid out.  Staff was welcoming, helpful and every one was just as nice as the next.  The concierge did her best to find us a last minute dinner reservation for 13 to no avail as we did not plan ahead but all worked out fine. She would have kept trying until something was found but we were okay on our own.   
The following day, as we were walking out to the wedding I received a frantic call that the bride needed something last minute. I was able to go to concierge, explain what I needed and leave for wedding-the concierge handled it and upon return to hotel before reception let me know I would receive  a call to pick up item so bride has what was needed by end of night.  All done with a s,I Le on their faces.  
We wish we didn’t live so close so we had an excuse to come back!  Don’t hesitate to stay at Le Meridien, located close to Union Square, North Beach, pier 39 and the Ferry b
building.  Perfect location and wonderful staff!< /review>

My husband and I stay at this property whenever we are in the city. You can walk everywhere. There are great restaurants nearby. The staff is wonderful. We enjoyed lounging in the lounge daily.< /text>

<review>We enjoyed our stay.
We chose le Meridien based on its location and price per night

The room was lovely and quite large, that bathroom was a decent size and the bedding was comfortable. We found that we had plenty of room for storing our clothes and we enjoyed our short down time by watching tv on a huge tv screen.

Check in was easy and the staff was pleasant.

The drive up and lobby could use a little work: the drive up was filthy and dirty not to mention cold-but service was excellent-the lobby could use some pizazz and warmth.

We had one robe in the room for 2 guests.

The value was good for SF and for what we were doing that night-the location was perfect.</review>< Pics>

<Review>Well located hotel in the city near Chinatown and other attractions. Great views of the city and the bay bridge depending on what room you get.

Parking is atrocious though ($70/night) so just park across the street at Embarcadero center for half the cost or take advantage of free metered street parking after 6pm and free on Sunday’s.</Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMls8DWRdBddoKdNoBRqcs84jb69L-qIwL2izGy=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures>< Response>

Nice, large room. Excellent bar and fantastic drinks! The entire wait staff was very kind and very accommodating. Parking is a little steep but I think common for San Francisco. It is in the financial district so fairly easy to get to other areas. Would recommend and certainly stay here again</review>

What a fantastic time! Great friendly staff who took the time to ask questions.....wait....what? Asked if I needed laundry, or wake up call, or room service. Like old school hotels where people cared. Great view, great bed, great sleep. In the city! Amazing.  Had a fun time getting ready for a beautiful wedding day!< /review>

<Date>1563062400000<//Date><rating>None< /rating><text>The property is dated but clean. It is close to major tourist attractions and is at a walkable distance to the pier. Hence convenient for tourist explorations around the city. The property itself isn't very astonishing & the rooms & decor is pretty dated. 

During my stay, there wasn't a (significant) recognition of my Titanium Elite status & no room upgrades were provided. The property doesn't have a lounge and the breakfast offered at the restaurant is just meh. It was one of the "restricted" continental breakfast I had in a full service Marriott recently. 

In short, pick this property if you really need to be close to the pier and if the rates are discounted. For a full price, there are many other Marriott's in the city which are far better than Le Meridian SF.</text>< pictures>

This property used to be lovely and posh. The quality has declined severely in the past few years. It is a 3 star at best now with mismatched, cheap furnishings and amenities. Room service food was limited, laughable and absurdly overpriced. The only positive is the location and the views now. The “remodeled” lobby is baffling and a downgrade with limited public space. There are so many nicer hotels in the area for the same price.<//review>

Wasn’t but sure staying in the financial district was a goodbye idea but I was amazed. The facilities, amenities, staff, and location combined for hr perfect too quick visit to SF. We crammed in a week’s worth of activity to two days thanks to your amazing concierge. Next time we come to San Francisco we will definitely stay with you!</review>

<Text>Nice hotel with a great view. However, there is no air vent in the bathroom, and I'm not a huge fan of having a sliding door with a small gap as the bathroom door. For a room with a king sized bed, I'd imagine that someone would assume that there is more than 1 person in the room.

Other than the bathroom's design, the room and staff overall are great.</Text>< Pics>

We had neat city views with a peek of the Bay.  I loved the curtains that we had that could make the room especially dark! The bathrooms tub was not a large tub, but larger than most hotel tubs where I could have a comfortable soak. The complimentary bath products  were higher end  ones that I LOVE. I didn’t get a chance to try room service but the menu options sounded delicious. Hope I get to come back.</Review>< Pictures>

Our housekeeping was exceptional.

<Review>I stay at numerous Marriott properties throughout the year and the service, aesthetics, and comfort are generally always superb. The Le Meridien however stands out as being one of the best. The service was absolutely outstanding. Some of the friendliest staff I have encountered. I couldn't believe the room upgrade I received. I was easily able to add an extra night after our plans had changed. Even when I had initially planned to check out, no room change was required. The staff at the restaurant were excellent and food was great. I will definitely be staying here again the next time I am in SF.< /Review>< Pics>

My usual spot when traveling to SF for work. They remember me, the rooms are modern and set up to work from, usually with a view of the bay. Great gym and bar. Breakfast is good, I wish they used normal sized to-go coffee cups though.</Review>

< Review>
Stayed here for 1 night on business trip, after business was done, got a chance to explore the city. The hotel is modern, clean and I got a nice room with a great view of the bay and the bridge. The room was cozy and quiet. Room service was surprisingly better than expected. Only thing was the lobby bartenders seemed overwhelmed even though it wasn’t busy, was not attending to customers in the order they arrived. I definitely want to come back for a longer stay.< /Review>

Nice place to stay if they have your prepaid room available. It was wife, myself and our son. We were downgraded to a king room after booking a suite for July 4th.  A complimentary breakfast was given so I guess that’s something.  But squeezing 3 into a king bed was no fun.</Review>

<Text>The lobby/rooms were quite nice and up to date contrary to the exterior of the hotel, as a gold member I was upgraded to a Bay view room and thoroughly enjoyed my stay, there aren't any swimming pools here.  The Montgomery Bart station is walking distance as is the pier.  The entrance is on Clay street and not on Battery street in case of transportation instructions.  The room was nice although there wasn't a master switch for the whole room, so after turning on all the lights, you'd need to go one by one to turn everything off.  The bathroom although large, is a little dated and could use some remodeling to match the rest of the hotel.  There is free Illy coffee in the 3rd floor and a Starbucks across the street.< /Text>< Pics>

I liked the fact that the lobby was not hectic and busy unlike other hotels.  People gravitated quickly to the bar or the elevators that are away from the lobby.  I think this is a great asset.</text>

The accommodations were nice, but one staff member saw me entering the building with my hands full and didn't even offer to open the door. Even though he was front desk staff, the human thing to do was to at least open the door. Also, I was charged twice in one day for 1 vehicle. You have to do better.< /Text>

My stay was going well (it is a good hotel) until I went into the Resturant.  The staff is lackadaisical and doing everything (one person spent 5 minutes, no exaggeration) wiping down a table) and have no sense of the customer- expert at avoiding eye contact.  I couldn’t even get a refill on my coffee.  Go across the street to Peet’s.<//Text>

<Text>My short stay here was great!

I arrived late in the night after fighting flight delays all evening. I was greeted immediately and the concierge began to review my reservation and carried out his script of information - short, thorough, and simple, which was about as much as I could handle given the timing.

I was given a double bed room, which was ample for just me. I found the accommodations very comfortable and the ease of finding all the essentials was great. There was a charging port for my electronics right next to my bed, and I was able to easily access and use the iron to get my clothes ready for the morning.

The bed was firm and easy to fall asleep in. The bed was lined with plenty of blankets, and I was able to modify the temperature in the room to my specifications with ease.

In the morning, the breakfast was great - full continental! Definitely go for the russet potatoes! I added a bit of Tabasco sauce for a hearty start to the day.

Overall - the ease from checking in and checking out was the best part. I am hoping for more stays in the future!< /Text></record></dataset><record>

Aside from issue with no microwave in room and problems with WiFi connection, I really enjoyed my stay. I wasn’t really bothered with reporting the issue of internet connectivity to staff so overall, my stay was stress free and highly enjoyable.<//review>

<Text>Hard to give 5 star compared to other Le Meridien.
In conclusion, I will try another hotel near hear next time. I think I might be more satisfied in another hotel.
View was good.
Room was little small but maybe similar to other hotels in San Francisco.
Best thing is the free laundry policy that was used in the fitness center. But I think this is only for platinum elite member.
Breakfast is not a buffet. Continental breakfast is complimentary for platinum elite members, but not worthwhile.
Note that free coffee is provided every morning.< /Text>< pictures>

Honestly, I’m so glad we picked this hotel. Being in the city is one thing, but making sure you stay at the right hotel is a huge factor. This place is legit. It’s gorgous, Chic, modern and clean. The personnel working there all made our stay a great one. We loved being in the room as much as we enjoyed being out and about. The bathroom lighting is legit. And the big mirror in front of our bed, plus the natural light coming in from the big windows, was amazing for our practicing making babies sessions. Can’t wait to be back!< /Text>

Stayed at the Le Meridien while visiting family. The hotel was, hands down, the most beautiful hotel I've ever stayed in. Also, the location in downtown made all the sites San Francisco is known for very accessible. The staff was phenomenal, friendly, and knowledgeable.<//text>

This hotel was great for a weekend getaway for a birthday. Laura at the concierge desk is amazing! She gave us free drink coupons and upgraded our room for our second night when one became available and we got an excellent bay view. The hotel offers free coffee and tea in the morning on the third floor and the hotel location was great. Walking distance to the ferry building which has a lot going on during the weekends. Rooms are clean and really the staff is what makes this hotel a great stay.<//Review>

<Review>Great stay at Le Meredian San Francisco for my first honeymoon.  Was able to watch the boats come in during sunset and the fog roll in during the morning.  Highly recommend a room with a view of the bay to experience this.  Concierge team were great and helpful as well.   Don't forget to grab a cup of coffee in the morning from the restaurant.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None< /resp><GmapID>0x8085806033e06771:0x5585cb03086b5f0f< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Le Méridien is French for the Meridien and that's cool. Not sure what it has to do with a hotel, but I will say this is a higher end hotel for the city. It's centrally located which is probably the best part of the hotel.

Full disclosure, I've only been the the bar and by proxy; the lobby and bathrooms. Fun fact the bathrooms are located on the second floor above the lobby.

The hotel looks nice and the people look worldly. Hope this helps!<//Text>

I made the last minute decision to stay in SF for my company party. The price was very cheap considering a Saturday night in December in San Francisco. The hotel was in a great location and was absolutely comfortable. I didn’t want to get out of bed in the morning. I will say that the Valet parking was very steep at $75 for the night. But other than that I was a very happy customer.< /Text>

It was a "fancy" hotel. Meaning expensive and clean, but I don't think it's worth the money. If you want to overspend and feel fancy, go for it. I feel that your dollar is more valuable elsewhere. 

Room was hot and comforter is sweltering. It was a nice extensive hotel otherwise.<//Review>

I loved the room, the staff, the food, and the styling. An amazing place all around! It also has easy access to a walkway down to alot of the piers so that you don't have to wait at any street crossings. It was by far the best hotel experience I have ever had.< /Review>

You can walk to so many places.

The staff is polite and helpful.

The place is very clean.

Some rooms have a superb view. 

Thanks Le Meridien for all the recommendations your kind and helpful staff provided also for accommodating where to keep small carryon. These little deTAils mAkE ALL the difference.<//text>

Reception staff was very friendly. Evening room service from Steven, and chicken quesadilla were very good. The room had a very strong chemical smell; we opened the window to dispel as much as possible. Requested a fan and were told the hotel has five fans all of which were being used. One wash cloth in bathroom. Mattress (king) was terrible, with major dips on each side. Should have been replaced long ago. We rolled into each other. Bed did not have top sheet so we called and requested one. We were told housekeeping was gone for the day which led us to insist someone, anyone, bring a sheet. Breakfast of scrambled eggs and omelet was ok. Delivered without water and one napkin for two diners.<//review>

No amenities.  This is NOT a category 6 hotel.  It is also located in the financial district so if you are visiting SF for vacation, there a much better places to stay.  Keep looking for a different property. I cannot think of a reason to stay at this hotel.< /review>

After I left I got charged for something I didn't have from the minibar. I rang up to speak to the front desk and got told it would be looked into and they would contact me. Nobody did so I rang up again and was told it would be taken off. It has now been charged to my credit card. I rang up again and got put through to an answerphone.I now have to go through my credit card company to get the charge reversed. Deceptive and poor service</Text>

Note check in was late-ish slightly past 3PM as they were busy but they comped drinks at the bar. Avoid room 818 and adjacent as they overlook the street and are hence noisy (loud music into early in the morning in our case)<//review><UserId.>110441695624177002324</UserId.><pics>None</pics><user_name>Toots78< /user_name></record></dataset><record>

My son and I had the most relaxing and fun time in our very clean room with a view! The hotel is located in a great location and the front desk gives walking directions to wherever you'd like to go. It is important to note that there is a parking fee of $70/night on hotel grounds, but it is in and out access. We were overall very comfortable and impressed!< /Review>

<Text>Other than the view and the room layout/decor, average at best. I was disappointed that the experience did not live up to the star level. Inside the room you can clearly hear conversations in the next room, the hall and the street. The sound was not muffled it was as if the conversations were being had in the same room. The crab cakes from the restaurant/ bar were terrible. I ordered omelettes for breakfast via room service at $21 each and they were nothing special either. The original room I was in, the bathroom was dirty. Once my stay was over, I discovered I had also been over charged by $115. Thank you Agnes for resolving the issue. Overall, I was not impressed.<//Text>< Resp>

The hotel is amazing! My boyfriend and I were spending the weekend in SF and so happy that we chose this hotel. Fortunately, we got to the hotel early and instead of getting a room on the 20th floor that would have been a normal size room, we got a suite with balcony on the 8th floor (corner unit) with amazing views of the bay bridge and Oakland hills. The staff were all great and the room was huge and clean! I would definitely stay here again and highly recommend this hotel to those looking for a quiet area to stay yet close enough to local bars/lounges and great restaurants.<//Review>

My room was huge, the bathroom had a shower and tub.  Ironically the outlet/plug was on the inside wall to the toilet under the phone hanging on the wall. It's an older hotel. Staff was friendly, but when expecting 4 items via FedEx, they could only confirm 2 via phone, though they had received all 4. It's good, better than some, but not great.</review>

This place is fantastic. Great views of the bridge from the room I was in. The beds and bedding was simply exquisite. Free coffee was great too. Friendly staff as well. I stay in fancy hotels as a sport and this one is near the top as far as a room with a bed goes. Stay there and you won't be sorry.< /Text>

The long-term staff (consierge, door people, cleaners and wait staff) are first rate. The room is fine though the pressure in the bathroom sink is low (always has been and I have stayed her for close to 15 years. The bar music has gotten a bit too noisy as I have gotten a bit older. Overall, a fine place to stay in SF’s financial district.<//text>

<text>Great hotel. Seems to be well located. 1/2 a block from the Transamerica Pyramid. The rooms are very nice. The beds are comfortable. I didn't interact with the staff much but the doormen we're super helpful when asked about recommendations. There is a bar in the lobby but I didn't check it out, so no info on that. My only wish is that the air conditioning in the rooms got below 65 degrees, but that is just personal preference. Overall a great stay!<//text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None</Response>< gmapID>

< Review>
I stayed here several times and i think it keeps getting better. Last visit i had a corner suite and it was terrific. Overlooking the Embarcadero Center and the Bay Bridge. Very nicely appointed, very comfortable. Love the walk in shower. And even had a balcony.

The bar has a great vibe, though i wish they would serve food later ( I think they stop at 10). 

Morning breakfast spread is very good.

Great location at the Embarcadero Center. Easy access to North Beach, Jackson Square, Chinatown, etc.

Very nice front desk staff too.

HIghly recommend.</Review>

<Review>We spent a Labor Day weekend here and it was pretty nice.
Though there were some issues

• The parking fee is $75 a day. So we parked at the Embarcadero Center $35 a day. I mean, we drove all the way from LA to SF, and we have to pay $75 for parking while staying at the hotel, it doesn’t make sense.

• To be able to connect WiFi, you have to pay $14 or so for a day, or if you are a Marriott member, then it’s free.
I didn’t really pay attention to the smaller print under the price that it was free for a Marriott  member, so we didn’t really connect to WiFi .
We do have unlimited att service so it wasn’t a big deal. Though it is really something that I can’t understand why it’s being charged.

•Along the hallway there is a water dispenser with fruits inside, which is amazing ! I just wish they could have used normal glasses, instead of so many plastic cups there. They can do better for the environment!

Overall it was a pleasant stay, I just wish there weren’t so many extra charges for standard services.<//Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOHth2WE9HLPtm_IUKkseIvGw_ZEKaDdgp6phZr=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics>< resp>

<Text>The hotel is in a nice location, within walking distance to public transportation and with plenty of entertainment and dining options nearby. I was visiting a friend - I didn't stay overnight. The lobby was beautiful. The room was clean and updated - large, with a great view from the patio that can fit two people.</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

<review>Rooms were great and spacious, location quite convenient. Only significant problem was that our two rooms were not cleaned until 7pm the first one, and 8pm the second one. No apologies fron the front desk personnel and somewhat of a rude attitude, as the only explanation was "we had a fullly booked night yesterday". Would hardly consider coming back.< /review>< Pictures>

<Review>Le Méridien rooms are pretty comfortable, except for the couches in the suits. The in room dining is pretty good. I would stay away from the lobby bar, Bar 333. The experience I had with the server was bad, the server was bad, and the cleanliness was bad. This means Bar 333 was generally bad all around.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Date>

The room at Le Meridian was fantastic! Great views and very comfortable. The location of the hotel was also great as it is close to the BART and only a short walk to many great restaurants. Also only a short Uber to many local attractions. The staff was a bit cold upon check in and not overly friendly. That could use a bit of work.</text>

<Text>My family and I stayed at this location day after Christmas. We had 2 Jr Suites and 1 full suite reserved, all with views. We were celebrating my father's 90th birthday and had requested an early checkin. I had called in ahead of time.

- Upon arrival at 3pm (note, not even an early checkin), our rooms were not ready. The staff was less than accommodating, and we had to escalate to the manager. 
- Our suite, meant to accommodate 3 people had 1 hand towel and two bath towels, no wash clothes.
- The beds in the rooms had no fitted sheets, and just one flat sheet covering the mattress (no cover for the duvet). I called housekeeping and was told that because of Christmas, the hotel was short on linen!!!!!!!
- The pullout sofa was very uncomfortable, with minimal padding.
- The rooms had no coffee machines.
- There was NO recognition of my father's special birthday, despite several requests.
- I am an SPG (and corporate) member, but they told me because we had booked through Expedia, our rooms do not qualify for the free wifi.

On the positive side:
- The views of the rooms were great.
- Proximity to embarcadero and Ferry building was great.
- The valet staff was very attentive.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None<//resp>< GmapID>

Beautiful, modern, chic rooms with great views of the city and bay. Super comfortable beds. Friendly and very accommodating staff. Great stay! Maybe just bring earplugs in case the union protesters (who are NOT employed or former employees by the hotel, but are hired to protest non union hotels) start to picket.< /Review>

We stayed at Le Meridien for 3 days in late October. The hotel is just wonderful;staff is smart and customer oriented. The bar is terrific with drink specials every day and a great assortment of reasonably priced bar food for snacking. Rooms were immaculate ,amenities restocked daily. The location is very convenient to the Ferry Building,Embarcadero,BART,muni system and the staff can actually tell you which bus/train to take to where you want to go. I highly recommend Le Meridien for any trip to SF-oh yeah,weekend prices are very reasonable< /text>

<Review>Always great service and very dog friendly. No extra charges or deposits for your pooch. Very comfortable rooms with great views of the city. 24 hour Room Service is fast and delicious but expensive. Ask for a non connecting room or you will hear everything going on next door. Bathroom doors are all sliders which limits privacy.</Review>< Name>

<Text>The room was whatever. Could def have been nicer but I’ve been in worse. The service on the other hand was disgusting. They told us they would charge a $100 hold which ended up being a $258 on top of the room charge. When we called to find out the guy was rude and said hotels charge a hold for rooms! And then my wife called again the next day to get further information and the woman said we should be calling our bank not the hotel. We were there with my wife’s company who paid for a lot of people to stay there. I will never come here again and will tell others not to including
My wife’s company. If you don’t know how to do customer service then you shouldn’t be in the business. Thankfully we have the money to wait 3-5 days for that outrageous hold to come back to our account!< /Text></record>

My husband and I have stayed here once before and loved it, so we thought it would be the perfect place to stay to ring in the new year. Apparently, everyone else had the same idea and the staff didn't really know how to handle it well. We arrived early - around 1:30pm and asked if it was possible to check in. We were told that we could have a room on a lower floor (5) now or, as SPG members, could be upgraded to a higher floor but would have to come back at 3pm to get our room key, as the room wasn't ready yet. Of course we decided to do this and promptly checked our luggage with the bellhop. We ended up coming back at 4:15pm, well after the 3pm check in time stated on our reservation (and reiterated by the desk clerk), only to be told that our room was still not ready. While waiting, I overheard 2 other desk clerks tell other guests that their rooms were also not ready, as the hotel had had many late check out requests for that day, as late as 2pm. Long story short (ha!) we were told our room would still not be ready for another 45 minutes, yet by this point we had already recovered our luggage from the bellhop and were supposed to meet friends at 5pm. After much time spent researching available rooms, the desk clerk ended up giving us a lower room floor (6) that was less than what our reservation had stated (king superior) with no upgrades, points, or anything to make up for our wait or their lack of planning. When I asked about the wireless code, she said it was not part of our room package. The room itself was fine - no view, mediocre bathtub/shower, comfy bed - but I was disappointed in the service and will not plan on staying here again. The customer service and amenities are far nicer at the other SPG hotels in SF we love</Text>

Very friendly service at reception. I was able to check in a little early without a problem, and was given an explanation of things at the hotel. The room did not have a coffee maker in it, but one as brought to me when I asked. Room was spacious and nicely furnished with a modern decor. I was located near the elevator bay but never heard any noise.<//review>

Came here for our honeymoon. Great front desk service. Great room service as well. Very clean rooms, restroom, and lobby. The restaurant in the hotel was very up to scale! Food was good with decent prices and good drinks. The bartenders were also helpful enough to give us some good local restaurants. The only downfall was the parking. It was a bit expensive but the garage across the street was VERY reasonable! I will definitely be staying here again.</text>

<Review>We stayed three nights for our honeymoon and I can't express enough the wonderful time we had staying at Le Meridien San Francisco. 

We were kindly greeted (and upgraded!) by lovely Nica at the Reception and the hotel was superb.

Quiet rooms, stunning views to the bay, spacious. All the employees were always happy to help and the hotel could not be in a better location, close to Sheraton Wharf and the main shops of Sant Francisco near the Union Sq. Area.

We were so impressed with the hotel views, thank you so much for making this stay so special for us!<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None</response><GmapID>0x8085806033e06771:0x5585cb03086b5f0f< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

I had to cancel an upcoming stay due to a death in my family.  I actually received and have proof of the email confirmation stating that the reservation has successfully been cancelled.  Still, I was incorrectly charged in full for the stay and after my 15th email and or/call over the past 3 weeks and proof of the cancellation confirmation they are  refusing to issue a refund.  Message to management: 1) have some decency given the situation; 2) I have an actual confirmation of the cancellation ahead of the stay so my personal situation shouldn't even have to come into the conversation...  I have no opinion of the facility itself but there are plenty of hotels in SF that are ethical in the treatment of their customers.< /Text>

<review>Overall property needs renovations.  It is old and not well kept.  The housekeeping area is not proactive.  I asked numerous times about my sheets being dirty and needed them cleaned .  I did not have amenities.  The bathroom is old and there is mold on the tiles and in the bathtub.  The place looks overall run down and dirty.  Just not a place I would consider staying unless there is some major renovations!</review><pics>None< /pics><response>None</response><gmap_id>0x8085806033e06771:0x5585cb03086b5f0f< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

We are from the East Bay and have stayed in San Francisco many times before. This stay was one of our best. Le Meridien staff was friendly and helpful from the minute we stepped out of our car.
Our room was comfortable. All of our bar and food service experiences including staff that were prompt and helpful. We will consider coming back on future trips.</Review>

My first time ever at a Le Méridien and what a pleasant surprise.  Its style is what I’m into and the room was a lot larger than most rooms at other hotels. View, bed and bathroom were all great. I highly recommend and I will be seeking out Le Méridiens in the future.<//Text>

Hotel is great, the rooms are amazing. The location is great central to everything in the city. I makes you forget for a moment your in San Francisco. But still able to see the bay. Service was great the only issue was at check in the agent didn't seem interested in checking guest in. That would the only issue with my stay.< /Review>

Decided to go to San Francisco for New Years because a few friends had never been. I booked the Le Meridien and we made the drive up from SoCal. Upon arrival, the valet parking was quick and attentive. The lobby construction was still going on, but it was easy to figure out where to go for check in.

We were given the Canberra Suite which had a decent view of the bay. The room was very nice and clean.

The location made for an easy walk to surrounding areas, such as the Embarcadero.

I would definitely recommend the hotel to friends.<//text>

From the moment the car wrangler takes your car to the smooth and upbeat tone of check-in to the absolutely staggering north and east facieng views to the lovely chocolate-dipped strawberries and sparkling wine brought to us as an acknowledgement of our honeymoon travel (smoothly and graciously switched to sparkling water when they learned we don't drink the boozeahol) to the concierge helping us to decipher the vagaries of GGB toll crossings to the team effort required to load out our myriad and varied luggage, this stay was excellent. Literally every member of the staff with whom we engaged has a smile on their face and in their vice and interacting with them was a joy. I am now also addicted to the bath products so thanks for that! The bed is comfy, the room clean and delightful and this has certainly become my home in SF. Thank you for helping to make this leg of our honeymoon romantic and beautiful!< /text>

We went on an all girls getaway and two of our friends had never been to San Francisco. Thank you for making our stay so enjoyable with your excellent service and clean hotel room. Our concierge was amazing. She really knew the town well. The desk recommended the Italian restaurant E Tutto Qua and we STILL talk about our experience! It was one of the most enjoyable restaurant experiences we've ever had. During our stay, we were also scheduled to go on the Big Bus Tour. Our concierge saw the bus from inside the hotel room and ran outside to flag the bus driver down so that he didn't leave without us. I recently stayed at your hotel again two weeks ago and saw the same concierge and she remembered us! Excellent hospitality!< /Text>

Spent Christmas and NYE here with my wife and it was wonderful..  We celebrated our 1st wedding anniversary with friends that live in the area. The hotels has  clean rooms and  great service. It is about an 8 min walk to Bart . Plenty of restaurants within walking distance. Breakfast in the hotel was pricey but good. The Ferry Building has a wonderful farmers market with excellent coffee and restaurants that have almost any kind of food you like. Ask for a room with a view of the bay. The fireworks show on NYE was short but spectacular..  we would definitely stay here again..</text>

First, I would like to say the hotel was very nice and clean, but not centrally located at all. I do not have the right words to describe my disappointment in the staff and the treatment on the phone prior to our arrival. After very hectic and disappointing flight cancellations due to weather, the hotel management was unwilling to work with us on reimbursement or credit toward a future stay. Then on arrival, a day late, (after calling to talk through situation and confirm we were still coming) it was so obvious they gave our room away and scrambled to put us in an upgraded room which was right next to penthouse with screaming/partying all night long. Disappointed is an understatement. I thought someone would follow up with me after writinf corporate, but have heard nothing.</text>

I was mostly concerned with a clean and comfortable room. The executive suite on the 23rd floor delivered on that, and then some. Nice view!

I also chose this hotel because of its convenience. My fiancee and were able to easily walk to the ballpark, cruise the financial district, and then hop over to North Beach for breakfast.

The staff is friendly and courteous, they helped me out big time with a cool room and watching our things when we arrived (too early to check in).<//Text>

<Text>This was our annual Christmas weekend stay in Downtown. We are 3 couples who meet every year. When I was booking, I didn't realize that I had booked a Handicap accessible room. Josiah, at the front desk, was so wonderful. He was able to change the rooms, we were able to check in early and had a great view. All done professionally and with a great smile. Thank you Josiah!

I have stayed at this hotel a handful of times and it always has been a pleasure to stay at. They always upgrade my rooms as a platinum member and the check in is always fast and easy. The hotel bar is a great place for cocktails as the bartenders make great drinks. The rooms are very updated and have very nice décor. Its a great place to stay for business or pleasure and the location is great to get to a lots of SF hotspots. I look forward to staying here again in the future. The staff is always very nice and friendly.< /review>

PROS
- Location is close to FiDi, BART, and all the downtown areas you need to get to
- Malin & Goetz bath products
- Super comfy bed
- Nice view of the Bay Bridge
- Awesome staff

CONS
- Sound insulation in the rooms is awful (bring earplugs)
- Not a single vegetarian entree on the menu (surprising for a hotel in SF)
- Had to ask for more shampoo, etc.
- Way overpriced

Overall, it's a nice hotel. Not the best I've ever stayed in, but it's nice. I wouldn't recommend it, mostly because I think it's about twice as expensive as it's worth. But if you don't mind paying extra, go for it!</Review>

<Review>The hotel feels a little dated but it is more than made up for by a great, responsive staff. I needed to make a room type change last minute and even in a sold out hotel they were able to make it work.

<rate>None< /rate><review>I travel to SF for work frequently, and before moving to DC used to live in SF for 12 years. My favorite hotel there has become the Le Meridien. Perfect location, walking distance to both the Embarcadero and Ferry Plaza, and also Chinatown/North Beach. It's also a long but fun waterfront walk to ATT Park during baseball season, which saves the hassle of parking near the ballpark. Rooms are large, comfortable and well maintained. Most importantly, the staff at the front desk and concierge are excellent, and very helpful. Highly recommended.</review><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None</Resp><gmap_id>0x8085806033e06771:0x5585cb03086b5f0f< /gmap_id></record>

We were able to walk everywhere from this location(even with a 2 and a 4 year old.) We returned around 3:00 and were greeted by the friendly front desk staff. Our agent, Cindy, seeing that we had 2 young children, upgraded us to a corner suite with a balcony and a separate business room. Every staff member we encountered, from the valet staff to the housekeeping staff, was very friendly and helpful. I would highly recommend this hotel to both business and leisure travelers.

Probably not so good for weekend stays, unless the price is right. Nice Platinum treatment with both rooms on the reservation upgraded to suites with awesome bay views. Breakfast amenity is nice, as it covers all the cold items of the buffet, and can be upgraded for a small fee. Overnight parking rates are obscene, so I just parked my rental car on the street, plenty of options between 6PM-8AM but be VERY careful of overnight street sweeping to avoid getting towed!</review>< Response>

<time>1391904000000< /time><Text>It's been a few years since I've stayed here. I'm looking back at my review from four years ago and wondering what I was thinking. While this Le Meridien is classy and comfy, it's in need of a re-vamp to keep it on par with four or five stars.

The location can't be beat if you want to be in super close proximity to the hundreds of companies in the immediate financial district. However, like many reviews have highlighted, the area is dead at night (which may be a plus for some weary business travelers). It's also a quick 3-minute walk to the Ferry Building which, if you've never been to San Fran, is a place you're going to want to spend as much time in as possible.

Using my SPG Suite Night Awards, I was upgraded to a Business Suite which was a fairly fascinating experience. You walk in to the main bedroom--fairly spacious with a large king bed, chair, dresser and large TV. There is also a teeny balcony with a chair and great views of the bay (see photos). Occupying a corner of the hotel, this Suite also features a large full office complete with large desk, credenza and yes, A FAX MACHINE. You know y'all, I was so thankful bc I had so much faxing to do during my 2014 business trip. The bathroom is large with a huge window for plenty of light. However, it has a nasty shower/tub combination not particularly fitting of a supposed luxury hotel. The room was clean, the sheets soft. the towels worn and reminding me of ones I had seen at Motel 6. My takeaway on the room is that it's a few years overdue for a total refresh.

No coffee makers in rooms. Annoying especially bc the free coffee in the hotel restaurant is only available in the morning.

FREE SHOE SHINE!

With so many awesome hotel choices in San Fran, I'd give LM another shot if the rates were really low.<//Text><gmap_id>0x8085806033e06771:0x5585cb03086b5f0f<//gmap_id><pictures>None<//pictures>< user_id>

<text>My wife and I traveled to San Francisco for the Memorial Day weekend and found a great rate at this hotel that included parking (regularly $52.00/night) as part of the hotel package for under $200.00/night.

The hotel is very modern - very nice lobby and great location that is close to shopping. It is located in more of a "business" district - but is within walking distance (20 minute walk) to Pier 39, and a short walk (2-3 minutes) to Chinatown and Nob Hill area.

Room was on a high floor and had a limited view of the Bay Bridge. The bed was very comfortable - great TV and very nice bathroom. We did not utilize the hotel restaurant or bar.

The staff was great - valets were very helpful in giving directions/etc. Would definitely recommend this hotel.< /text>< Pics>

Outstanding stay at this property. Stayed with my girlfriend over July 4th weekend. Greeted with an upgraded room with amazing views. We ate breakfast downstairs each day and were always warmly welcomed along with a nice breakfast. I've stayed here multiple times for business as well. I look forward to return visits.</review>

Just stayed for an old friend's wedding. Le Meridien is a class act in every sense of the word. Service was discreet and highly professional. Bernadette at check-in was fantastic and savvy. Staff always smiled at me and made me feel like a welcomed guest.

My room was upgraded to a fantastic suite on an upper floor that had a beautiful balcony with sweeping views of the bay, downtown, and the bay bridge. From the bedroom reading chair, I could see the Transamerica building. From the fluffy down comforter on the bed, I could see the bay. Ahhh..... memories.

I seriously did not want to leave my room, it was so luxurious and comfortable. Hotel was close enough to Telegraph Hill for me to go on a gorgeous run through rose gardens up to Coit Tower.

The hotel staff had a big part in helping create a warm space for my friend's wedding to happen in. They treated everybody like Kings. Thank you, Le Meridien!</review>

After 3 stays here, Le Meridien has joined my SF favorites list. It's close to public transportion & local great restaurants & attractions. The room quality is beyond excellent, quiet & comfortable, very classy. The hotel staff of truly professional, courteous, accommodating, and genuinely interested in my welfare. I definitely plan to return and recommend Le Meridien without reservation. Although I have not eaten here, I assume the dining is as excellent as the rest of the features here.<//Review>

No upgrades etc.
When I inquired about wifi cost for gold status was given a bit of a lecture about booking using the correct channels (Someone else books my hotels normally) and including the number on the booking (it was on my confirmation email but not the reservation)
Lighting in the room consists of a light-up picture frame that shines in your face and several standalone lamps that are difficult to reach from the bed (I rearranged). Reading lamp would be helpful, as well as a bed-reachable switch to shut everything off. 
"desk" area is a terrible barstool arrangement - we've got three people for 5-7 nights each (about $6K) in town who need to work but can't use the room to work due to terrible stool and bad 'desk' height. 
Food pretty average and pricey.
Decent location. Good view. Decent bed. 
Still here for a couple of nights if any management want to rectify but it seems poor staff attendance is an ongoing issue based on other reviews.<//text>< Pics>

The rooms were very comfortable, clean and well appointed with luxurious bedding, towels and bathrobe. The bathrooms were well appointed, well lit with adequate space and lighting for makeup. The staff was courteous, friendly and helpful. (with the excepttion of one night manager who couldn't seem to figure out that we wanted to check in at 4:00am when we finally arrived after a delayed flight) We still rated staff with 5 stars because we assumed this guy was just sleepy.
We would highly recommend this hotel.< /Text>

Made a reservation at 2:20 on Friday afternoon for a Friday evening reservation. Brittany at the service line was helpful, friendly, warm and service oriented. She explained the room options and provided me with reasonable rates. Upon arrival at the hotel, the front desk staff were smiling, prompt (I was in a hurry) and gave me two options for a room and I selected one. I had plenty of time to check-in, freshen up and get to my next appointment with ease. Thank you for the great service!<//Text>

If you’re looking for a Bay Area staycation spot, this is a great hotel. If you’re coming to SF for a vacation, still a reasonable priced option and the location is close to the wharf , and decent distance to Oracle Park, and great shopping.</text>

The hotel room is modern, clean, and your regular amenities.  The staff is friendly.  Located within 10 to 15 minute walking distance or a quick Uber/Lyft ride to Pier 39 or Union Square.  Very close to China town but there's nothing left to see there.

The only downside is overnight parking at hotel is a whopping $79 per night, and the faucet trickles water (shower is normal).

I would definitely stay here again.< /review>

I'm a speaker/entertainer, and I'm on the road at least 100 days per year. Trust me on this...I know a great hotel when I see one...and the LeMeridien San Francisco is at the top of my "Favorites List."
I'll stay with you guys any day of the week! FABULOUS service, gorgeous room, amazing bathroom (thank you for actually having adequate vanity space! and great lighting...I saw every wrinkle on my face!), view from the 21st floor was breathtaking, delicious room service. Your bellman George was so helpful to me...I could not have met my business obligations in San Francisco without his help. He went WAY above and beyond! He should train service personnel.<//Text>

<review>We recently vacationed in the San Fran area and stayed at Le Meridien. We had an extremely busy schedule which included a rental car to be dropped off and picked up at the hotel. Steve, the Concierge did an outstanding job of checking on the car, anticipating and answering questions concerning directions, restaurants, site seeing recommendations to name a few. We travel frequently and can say that Steve represents the hotel in an extremely professional manner and truly cares about the guests. He was definitely a contributing factor to us having a great time and stay. Thanks!!</review>< pictures>

We stayed many times at this hotel.  On this trip, the room was by the elevator and very noisy.  We pre-paid for the room and breakfast.  The service in the breakfast room was awful.  Bring back the breakfast buffet and get rid of the waiters (who are poorly trained and unfriendly).  This will cost less and your guests will enjoy it more.< /text>

< review>
This hotel is the most convenient Starwood property to San Francisco's Embarcadero Center, which makes it a highly convenient location for business. It's also walking distance to lots of great restaurants.

Rooms are modern, very comfortable, and by San Francisco standards, spacious. Most of the times I've stayed here as a Platinum guest, I've been upgraded to a suite; these are huge, have great views, and have a elegant, contemporary look. This is definitely comfort over glitz.

The bar is a great place to have a drink, and the food there is good as well; it's quiet enough to have a meeting or a pleasant conversation. This is a business and upscale leisure travelers sort of scene, not a "buzz" kind of place.

The restaurant serves a terrific breakfast (a la carte), and it's a great place for a business meeting -- quiet, comfortable, service is attentive but unobtrusive. There's no particular reason to eat lunch or dinner here, though, with the abundance of other excellent eateries in the area.

The meeting rooms here are also decent, although the wi-fi reach isn't as strong as one might consider ideal.

Overall, if you're looking to stay in the Embarcadero Center area, and you're willing to pay a little extra, this is well worthwhile.<//review>

Nice location and amenities. Comfy bed. Soft towels. New TV. Powerful AC. No coffee in room but good stuff available in the restaurant. Was only loud when the protesters were out and about at 7am.

"What time is it?"
"Check out time!"

But other than that I've no complaints. Hope to return again soon.

Also good for Pokémon hunting. And close to City View dim sum which is good for a morning after drinking.< /text>

<review>Great choice for a business trip. The Le Meridien is convenient to just about everything in downtown San Francisco. Not as close to Union Square or the convention center, but not too far to walk. Rooms are nice and mine had a small balcony and separate office, which was great. My only (mild) critique would be the decor, which seems slightly dated style-wise. Not worn, just not brand new...<//review><Date>1345248000000</Date><gmapID>0x8085806033e06771:0x5585cb03086b5f0f<//gmapID><resp>None</resp><Name>JBG1973< /Name><Pics>None<//Pics><Rate>None<//Rate></record>

Over all the hotel is nice and clean. Just that the staff needs some training on how to welcome guests and don't judge them based on their decisions. Two areas to focus on would be valet parking and Room Service.<//Review>

<Text>Below was the email I sent to the hotel the last night I stayed there. After all the things they failed to meet as a SPG category 5 hotel, they yet again ignored this email. There was no apology, nor recognition of receiving it. Absolute radio silence.

Hi there,
It's my first time staying with your hotel and I feel I'd like to share my not so satisfying experience so far.

8/1
I checked in and immediately noticed the careless house keeping job done in this room. The keeper placed two bottles of shampoo and no shower gel, the shower cap box is empty inside.

8/2
I left two dollar bills on the side table for tips. When I returned, I was surprised to find that there was no refill of the the shampoo, conditioner, or lotion. The keeper has not checked and found the shower gel is missing. The tips were taken but a cup of water on the table was spilled and the keeper did not bother to wipe it. Left the water on the table and some water soaked Meridien notepads. I took the plastic cups in the room to use on my Sunday picnic and they were not filled either.

I hung my clothes in the closet and saw the SUPER DUSTY shades of the closet door as the light in the closet turned on automatically. Later on, when I brushed my teeth, I somehow got to a right angle and spotted the filthy inside of the toilet rim.

I have decided the housekeeping department is terribly managed and has no cleaning SOP, which I didn't expect from a SPG Category 5 facility. I also decided that the room is probably not cleaner with housekeeping so I declined my service for the next day.

8/3
I called to request for my water and an extra towel since I declined house keeping for the day. A 50-60 year old African American guy delivered it to my room. When I said thank you, he might be disappointed that I was not tipping him. Abruptly, he turned and walked away without giving me another look. I could't help but wonder what is happening to your hotel.

Finally, your WiFi is terrible. It is super slow for even accessing web pages. It is slower than any of the hotels I have stayed in China.This is not right to be slower than a country where internet is censored and this is shameful to have that speed in the Bay Area. I saw other people complained about the same thing. Please have it fixed.

I just had the most satisfying stay in your St. Regis Chengdu. As a customer, I saw a team working together and cared for every details of their job to be able to do it so right. As the same SPG Category 5 hotel, you are failing customer expectation and your reputation.

All the negative comments being said, I think the front desk staff is the best in this hotel. They are welcoming, quick to take action on service calls, and professional.

That was all I wanted to say and I wish you run a better hotel in the future.< /Text>< UserId.>

I routinely recieve "good" service from Hotels I visit. However, I must rethink my expectations after my stay at the San francisco Meridien. I felt like a welcomed guest and that no request was too small. From the front desk and concierge to the wait staff to the cleaning crew, they all had smiles on their faces and were especially comforting. Josia at the front desk was amazing in helping with my guests from China. Thank you, Thank You, Thank you!</Text>

< Review>
This is a fantastic hotel in a great spot! The rooms are extremely comfortable with great amenities throughout. It is within walking distance to two Bart stations as well as the Muni Metro. It was raining while I was visiting and there are complementary umbrellas in the room for use which was very helpful. The bar in the lobby stays open to a decent hour which is good considering there is not much open too late in the nearby area but the train being nearby helps in case you do want to venture out. The beds are very comfortable and the bathrooms are very nicely appointed with luxurious towels.<//Review>

Your stay begins with an excellent staff that greets you with a welcoming smile and a friendly hello.  A fast moving elevator brings you to your floor.  I'd suggest rooms 19 or 20 on each floor as they have the balconies.  The beds, bedding, pillows are amazing. We slept great. Excellent view of the bay bridge. Stocked minibar, independently controlled temperature between rooms.</Text>

<Review>This was our first time at Le Meridien in SFO and our experience was wonderful. We were allowed to check in early and upgrade our room preference. The room was large and the view beautiful. Laura at the concierge desk was enthusiastic and very knowledgeable. She was sincerely eager to make our stay enjoyable.

The location was great and we were able to walk almost everywhere we wanted to go. We plan to come back SFO and we will certainly stay at Le Meridien again.<//Review><UserId.>None< /UserId.><Rating>None< /Rating><Name>NayNay60</Name>< Pics>

Stayed at the Le Meridien for a week of holidays. The Facility has very high standards. The staff is very attentive. 

The concierge Ms. Laura gave me very professional advise and made my visit to San Francisco a total success. I was impressed with the dept of her knowledge of the town.</text>

Our stay at Le Méridien was excellent. The staff was very professional and accommodating. We were even upgraded to a bay-view room which was the focal point of our suite. The room was comfortable with artistic touches and detail, differentiating the experience from the cookie cutter hotels from the past.</text>

It is tony hotel with upscale, masculine decor (although I actually preferred the lobby prior to renovations). Rooms are nice, especially with an upgrade to one of the suites (and those with balconies and views of the Bay and Bay Bridge are spectacular). One glitch this time was that the restaurant server was quite rude, loudly admonishing us in front of everyone in the restaurant what could be eaten at the buffet with the complementary Platinum continental breakfast amenity (only bread and rolls, not cereal!)< /text>< pictures>

Room was clean and spacious and we got a high room with a great view. It was great that you could open the window partially to get fresh air while sleeping. The hotel is a short walk to the Ferry Building, Chinatown, a little further to the North Beach district, and close to one of the cable car route stops.Just be aware, being the financial district, many of the cafes/eateries are only open during the day Mon-Fri. No breakfast is included but there are no shortage of eateries close by Mon-Fri. On a weekend you may need to resort to Subway. There's a bar downstairs where we had a cocktail, they offer small bites and also there is a small adjacent restaurant for meals which appeared reasonably priced.<//text>

We didn't see that the hotel was under renovations when we booked online. So, when we arrived and realized they were in the middle of a renovation, I thought the rooms would be noisy, and expected an impatient staff. I was pleasantly surprised, and in fact, received outstanding and warm customer service. The bell man was very personable and eager to show us the shortcut to the elevator - even though I am sure he'd done it a thousand times. The front desk, even though in a make shift lounge due to the construction, were smiling, quick in checking in, genuinely upbeat. We were on the Starwood Preferred floor, with a beautiful view. The room was immaculate, and we enjoyed the amenities. We heard no noise, and slept great through the night. We both travel quite a bit for work, and typically stay at 4 star hotels and up. The most important things in our experience are 1) the cleanliness of the room 2) the ease of location / amenities 3) the service. Le Meriden San Francisco was right on spot with delivering every thing we needed to make the stay enjoyable.</Text>

We are very well traveled. Our stay here was very gratifying. Large room, well appointed decor, quite, lots of window light, sliding doors but very low noise from the city activity when closed. HVAC was also low noise, kept the room very comfortable. Updated bath, plush towels, fresh pressed robe, big bed, nice flat panel TV’s with HD programs. Well stocked mini frig. Staff was very professional.< /review>

Why do I choose Le Meridien first when I visit San Francisco?

Location: It's nestled in the Financial District, and I can walk to several great places from the hotel (City Lights Books, the Financial Building, Union Square). When I'm unsure of where to go, the concierge, valet, AND door man come together to brainstorm with me.

Service: I've always been respected and treated like a friend at the hotel. All staff I've met have been kind and helpful.

Art!: The rooms and marketing are adorned with local student art work. What a great aesthetic investment!

Amenities: The workout room has a range of LifeStyle fitness equipment that is well maintained and contemporary.

SPG: I get points for having the Le Meridien experience each time I visit. How neat is that?</review>

< Review>
Overall, the hotel was a big disappointment. For starters, I received no warning whatsoever that the hotel was undergoing a major renovation. Even locating the "front door" to the hotel (behind the construction wall) was difficult! Once inside the hotel, guests are forced to take what is essentially a freight elevator up to the second floor where you then find a makeshift checkin desk. As I was accompanied by a business associate, these conditions were rather embarassing. And things didn't get any better... Notwithstanding only an hour earlier SPG.COM reflected that I'd received a Platinum upgrade to a Studio Suite, I was told at check-in that I was actually assigned to an "Executive" room (the manager on duty rather unapologetically insisted the change was due to a need to "balance the hotel" whatever that means... Of course this so-called Executive room (1509) was directly adjacent to the elevators, included a dirty plastic cup atop the dresser, and had none of the usual amenities (not even complimentary bottled water which I thought was standard)... I had to go to the front desk to remind them to send water bottles up to the room. Would not have booked this hotel had I known of the renovation and it's pretty outrageous the hotel conceals this fact from its guests (website contains no "special conditions" advisory no any other hint of what guests can expect). My only positive comment would be to acknowledge the good customer service shown by the young woman who checked me in. She was genuinely sorry for the last minute swap from a suite to a standard room and I appreciated that she tried (unsuccessfully) to have the manager find an alternative.< /Review>

Having just stayed at the Hilton Financial District earlier in the week for work, I can easily say the rooms (specifically the bathroom) are much nicer. Once the lobby construction is complete (aware of it before I arrived) I think it will be a 5 star experience all around.</Text>< Pics>

<Text>They overbooked the hotel and didn't have a room for us when we arrived late (1 am) although I called the day before letting them know that I would be in late and was told there wouldn't be any problems. At first they wanted to comp us a room at a different hotel, but due to my planned schedule the next day it would cause too much of a hassle to lug all my luggage back in the morning just to check in again. They then upgraded us to a suite for the night and offered to move our stuff to a new room. This compromise wasn't as bad, but we just had to make sure to pack all our stuff back. Not sure why this option wasn't the first presented as the first one is nice but it was already very late and we needed to be up and early the next day.<//Text><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

Beautiful rooms and huge by San Francisco standards at 417 square feet. Very nice and helpful front desk staff. They had our room ready and let us check in at 11am! Great lobby bar with craft cocktails. Great financial district location just 5 minutes walk to the Embarcadero BART station. Just a few minutes walk to the pier 1 ferry building. Will absolutely stay here again.<//text>

WOW! I'm not the coolest person, but boy...this hotel is chic! What is really impressive is the top notch service that the staff provides. The rooms are clean, modern, comfortable and inviting. The bar (and its staff), particularly Isaac, is phenomenal!
I appreciated that Bernadette at the front desk seemed very eager to please to the utmost potential. One tip, however, save yourself $$ and park at the public overnight parking across the street.
Overall... Is there such a thing as a 6 star rating?!< /text>

I booked through a third party travel website, hoping to save a buck.  It seemed as though staff (is trained to) provided discount-quality services, hospitality or lack of, and the room felt neglected and worn with low-end furnishings. Will not return. Bottom line is..missing that "above and beyond" guest sevices vibe.<//text>

<Rating>None</Rating><Text>I work in the neighborhood but needed a hotel for a weekend in the City -- first time at this property and would definitely come back. Got upgraded to a 2 room balcony suite with an amazing panoramic view from the Bay Bridge over to North Beach!

Great location -- a bit quiet on weekends, but close to Ferry Building for Farmer's Market, and plenty of great resturaunts close by.

Staff was great, we were able to check in early. Great little business center to print out Opera tickets, and no problem getting a taxi.

The bed was SO comfortable (and I'm picky). Bedroom has floor to ceiling windows, but great drapes that blocked out the morning sun.

Only complaint -- 2 chairs on balcony would be nice, we had to drag a desk chair outside. I also would've liked a sofa in the sitting room, instead of several individual easy chairs.

Will definitely stay here again and recommend to my business colleagues when they're in town.<//Text>< Pictures>

The hotel really needs renovation. The room was tiny and was meant for one person rather than two. We did have a large terrace/balcony which was great although it only had one chaise lounge. We had to ask for another and they brought a chair. Housekeeping responded very quickly with everything that we asked for - extra towels, the chair, a coffee maker. Yes the room had no coffee maker. Easy to walk to many activities - great location near the business district.<//review>

The hotel was amazing. The hotel room was clean bright and modern. There are minor things that make the hotel excellent. The staff is extremely courteous, proactively reaching for the door to hold open and more than enthusiastic to answer your questions. The room has minor touches that exude quality such as the soft close cabinet drawers and USB charging ports at the bedside and desk. Beautiful stone surfaces adorn each counter top. I can not overstate this, this hotel is fantastic. A minor gripe is that since it is in the financial district, a lot of the restaurants near it are closed on Saturday and Sunday. However, if you're willing to walk, Union square and Chinatown are only minutes away. This is actually a bonus for me. This makes the hotel more quiet at night but is still within quick walking distance from a lot of the must see sights.</Review>

<rate>None< /rate><Review>Love the Hotel location which is right across the street from Embarcadero Shopping Center 3-4 blocks from Pier 1/2 which on Saturdays have the best FARMERS MARKET!!! 5-6 blocks away from China town and 7-8 blocks from Union Square, overall everything to me was within walking distant. If you can’t walk then there is always a doorman to help catch you a cab, but this trip we tried UBER for the first time which was great too. The Front Desk check in was a breeze, she was a little busy but gave us a great room, on a great floor with a view of the bay bridge which we LOVED! The only thing is there is 4 of us girls, and we only had 1 umbrella on a rainy weekend. When we went to the concierge desk to ask for more, they told us that it was only 1 per room and they did not have any more available, now that is hard to believe because in a city that rains a lot why would you not have more umbrellas available for your guest upon request. So we were disappointed that we could not get more umbrellas to accommodate us. Then on Sunday our checkout day, we needed extra towels so I venture into the hall to find house-keeping and their cart. I ask the lady for if I could get extra towels, not only did I get attitude from her for asking she only gave me one and told me I need to call housekeeping next time if I wanted towels which to me is horrible customer service. I would of given this hotel a 5 star but my incidents of lack of customer service ruined it for me. I would recommend the location and hope that if you book this place you would encounter a person who is willing to help because those that were not willing to help made me feel like I do not want to go back. But then again the ones that did give us great customer service like the Saturday housekeeping lady did makes you want to go back. Very torn but hope that it can get resolved internally to give a better experience to their clients.< /Review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

<Text>From the moment we arrived the staff were friendly and helpful. Check-in was quick, the concierge staff provided good recommendations and provided solid food recommendations. Our room was nice and the floor to ceiling windows that opened to a view of the Bay Bridge were a perk. The hotel location was convenient to Embarcadero Center where you can walk above street level all the way down to the Ferry Terminal. At the end of the day, though, the bed was too stiff and we were placed in a room next to the elevators... so aside from perhaps a 3 hour reprieve, we heard the elevators all night during our stay. If not for the noise and dated/stiff mattress, this property would get a solid 4 stars. But for the price, I'd expect a better sleep experience.<//Text><time>1347667200000<//time><pictures>None< /pictures>< gmapID>

<review>Classy hotel in San Francisco's Financial district. This means that it is somewhat removed from the major sights (Union Square is a 10-minute walk away), but is therefore very quiet and peaceful on the weekends. Masculine tony décor throughout the hotel (really like the color scheme and marble). As a SPG Platinum member, almost always get a nice upgrade to a suite with spectacular views of the Bay. Fitness center is well-equipped and service is also top-notch. One slight drawback is that the neighborhood shuts down early and the hotel bar also closes relatively early on the weekends, so you will just need to take a taxi to access the vibrant San Francisco nightlife (which was not a big deal for me).< /review><pics>None< /pics><Response>None</Response>< Gmap_id>

<text>My wife and I have stayed at this hotel 4 times in the past 5-6 years. We love the quietness, and location. It is literally a 5 minute walk to the Embacdero and Saturday Farmer's Market. From the desk, concierge, housekeeping, and restaurant staff are exceptional.GM Mr. Bobba was so kind to send us a nice bottle of wine, flowers, fruit, and olives to acknowledge us as loyal guests. He also assigned us a beautiful corner room on the top floor. It was just a perfect hotel experience for 5 days all around. We are looking forward to future visits at your remarkable hotel. The recent renovation of the lobby and bar are also great improvements. Thank you for your genuine hospitality !!!!!!!!</text><userid>None< /userid>< Rating>

<Pictures>None< /Pictures><userid>None</userid><Review>Le Meridien is a stylish and recently renovated property, well located at the Embarcadero within easy walking distance of the Ferry Terminal, the downtown business center, Union square and the theater district, plus countless other attractions of note. It's also walking distance from the BART Embarcadero stop, thus being easily and inexpensively accessible to SFO airport. The room I had was spacious and graciously appointed with a truly functional business desk and two comfortable club chairs to boot, with just about every amenity one could want (bathrobes, scales, fully stocked minibar with expensive but not ridiculous prices). I'd be delighted to stay here again anytime.< /Review>< Rate>

<Review>After staying many times at other SPG properties nearby I must say I'm so happy I finally stayed at Le Meridien. This will be my number 1 selection for future leisure and biz trips. I loved the staff and most of the decor and our room was fantastic. Quiet and with a great view of the Bay Bridge. The location isn't as perfect to BART but I found that to be a minimal bother as it helped me discover new places and access.</Review>< userid>

Clean upscale professional room. We got one with a view of the Bay bridge and it did not support. USB outlets all over the room, super comfy pillows, if not for the prices at the bar ($7 for tea?!) It would be 5 stars. Would still go back though.< /Text>

<Pictures>None< /Pictures><Review>Le Méridien San Francisco, while situated in the midst of San Francisco's business district, is a bit of an oasis. It provides the guest with a more relaxing atmosphere than what you might expect.

Le Méridien San Francisco is located within easy walking distance of Union Square, Market Street, Chinatown and the business district.

We were upgraded to a suite, which was very spacious and provided us with a beautiful view of the city. The check in process was flawless as was the parking. The workout facilities met my requirements.

All in all, I would have no reservation about revisiting Le Méridien San Francisco during another visit to San Francisco.< /Review>< Name>

We had to be up in the City over the Thanksgiving weekend and were thrilled to get a remarkable deal through Travelzoo. We were a little apprehensive about which room we'd be in since it was SUCH a great deal (would we be put in the boiler room?) but the room was excellent! The mattress was fantastic -- the best we've slept on in years -- and there were so many high-tech amenities we didn't even know how to use them all!<//text>

This hotel is a great place to stay. It's obvious that it's extremely well-run. The rooms are impeccable, the staff is very attentive and the location in San Francisco makes it convenient both to the waterfront and other sites in the city. I'll return here and encourage others to do so as well -- ps the room service breakfast is excellent as well<//review>

<text>Hotel was great! When we arrived, they upgraded our stay from "Classic King" to "Executive King" (still unsure why), but it was a wonderful stay and pleasant surprise! :) 

The room was cozy and spacious. The only complaint I would have is the walls are extremely thin, to where you could hear water running from the next room, and the pipes. I've never had that experience in other hotels, so I would say that is one flaw I had. Didn't get much sleep because our neighbors and folks staying above us decided to take hour long showers between the hours of 2-5am. 

Other than that, the hotel was located in a nice proximity to attractions nearby- just a short uber/walk/drive away if need be.</text>< Date>

<text>We received an excellent deal on a large, comfortable suite, and the view (with balcony) of the Bay Bridge all the way to North Beach was stunning.

The bathroom and amenities were great (even a window in the bathroom), though there was no separate shower.

The bed was very comfortable. The furniture in the room was tasteful modern, but a bit hard and unwelcoming. A plush seating area to match the plushness of the bed would have been perfect.

One strange thing, however, which I didn't even consider until I noted the number of Starwood Hotels in the San Francisco area while 'registering'. It became necessary for us to stay in San Francisco longer than we had planned, and when we asked the front desk whether we could possibly extend our stay, they regretfully told us that they were completely booked. Understandable, but that was where it ended. No checking other Starwood Hotels, not even a referral toward one or the other. It seems an overlooked opportunity.

Overall, though, very nice hotel.< /text><Name>PJG1< /Name></record>

This hotel is one that I usually choose when I have to be in San Francisco for business or pleasure.

This time I was in town for work, and before checking in that evening I already had a CRAZY day full of non-stop meetings and putting out fires on deals. By the time I got to check-in that evening, I had been up for about 15 hours already and was frazzled. The front desk staff recognized me as a Platinum member, gave me a complimentary drink certificate, and then said "Oh, and we have a really nice room for you, hope do you get some rest and enjoy your stay." I had booked a standard room, and I remembered they were pretty nice anyway, so didn't think too much about that.

Then I went to my room, and I had been upgraded to a humongous, well appointed suite -- the NY Suite! It was extremely comfortable and had great views of the city and the Bay Bridge. I had all my local friends come and hang out in my living room that weekend, and it was a blast. Really made me feel that Platinum membership had some great benefits, and that the hotel staff really cared. They honestly could have just given me the room I had booked, and everything would have been fine...but they really did manage to impress me with the suite.

I will definitely come back and recommend to all my friends.<//review>

Was in San Fran for college visit with my daughter, and the concierge (s) at the hotel were the best, most friendly women Ive ever worked with at any of the Starwood properties I have stayed at over the past 10+ years. From designing a walking day tour to our sushi reservations, it was awesome. Thank you!!!< /review>

Double charged us for parking and mini bar items, but rectified upon calling their accounting department. It was nice that they made it right but lost some trust and happy that I scanned our bill.</Review>

Rooms are very spacious for downtown. But view is limited and windows disgustingly filthy. The decor is trendy and TV is much larger than most hotel rooms. Excellent restaurants and nightlife in walking distance.< /Text>

<Text>The hotel was very nice and the rooms were very comfy. We had a great view of the bay and city. The bar staff was very nice and so was the guy who checked us in. The conceirge staff were just ok. Very close to the BART stations, great for going to a Giants game. Walkable to many shopping areas. Not much open in the evening in the area so no late night eating or sightseeing areas. Nice area to sit and relax in the lobby.</Text>< Gmap_id>

Lets be honest, its all about the room and the bed, and this place gets it. Hip, swank, great views and above all comfortable. This hotel will impress even the most persnickety guest. "The M" is my home away from home. The food is outstanding however keep in mind the financial district is dead on the weekend so be ready to cab it to a restaurant for dinner if you don't feel like treating yourself with room service.</Text>

<review>My girlfriend and I went to San Francisco for our anniversary. We were given a hotel room upgrade and free drinks coupons to their wonderful bar (333 Bar). Our room was amazing! It was a corner room with a balcony that faced the Bay Bridge. We could see the LED light show on the bridge at night and the water front as well. The only bad thing was there were protesters at 7 am one morning with a blow horn, but we were already awake. The bathroom was great too. It had a shower and separate bath tub, and the water pressure was bliss. I loved the hotel location because it was downtown. My girlfriend and I loved to walk downtown and we were only a few minutes from Little Italy and China town. I highly recommend this hotel and look forward to staying here again.< /review>< Time>

Especially the staff at the front desk, right from the check in to check out experience is such a poor customer experience. No flexibility, willingness to listen to customer and they just want to go with a book rule and very rude in responding. Definitely not coming back and won't recommend this place at all.<//review><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< GmapID>

< Review>
I'm traveling more on business, and typically requiring an overnight stay in San Francisco. Le Meridien continues to be my hotel of choice. The facilities are more "boutique" like than other hotels in the area, which tend to be too big, and have a "behemoth" quality to them. Le Meridient is cozy, while at the same time offering all the comforts of a larger hotel. On this stay, the staff "upgraded" my room on check-in, but the only difference I could notice was that the room had a narrow view of the bay bridge. Either way, I'll be coming back, and I will gladly recommend this hotel to others who need accommodations in the financial district of San Francisco.</Review>

I liked the hotel very much, your service is really excellent and I felt safe and comfortable which is always important to me when I travel on my own. Thank you very much for being so kind to upgrade me to that lovely superior room with bay view. San Francisco has been already one of my favorite places and haveing had this amazing view even more. A special thank you to your outstanding Concierge Service!!!< /Review>

Stayed at Le Meridien for vacation.
Was awoken from a nap from the fire alarm in the hotel going off and a scary message to "cease activity" and proceed to the nearest exit. Turns out it was a false alarm. I think this should have been monitored more closely and possibly stopped sooner since it turns out a non-english speaking person got confused and pulled the fire lever right near the check in counter when there was no fire. I was also awoken from angry staff/locals boycotting the hotel since, according to them, Le Meridien doesn't treat staff fairly. Who knows the truth. Point is, picketers were loud, obnoxious, and tried to stop me and my mother as we left the building and shoved information pieces of the boycot in our faces. Other than that, staff NOT boycotting were friendly, beds were comfortable, free cofee was good. The Manager comped our dinner for the inconvienience of the boycott being so disruptive. Facility was clean and concierge was super helpful and recommended some great spots for breakfast. Wished some of the breakfast items for hotel room service were more affordable because we would have stayed in more.< /text>

< Review>
Check-in during construction was fine due to front desk making sure we got a nice view. Beds are usually comfy. However the bottom sheet (non-fitted) was tattered and was the only thing separating us from the mattress. So, you move a couple of times and the mattress is exposed. Not acceptable.
The other downfall is the bar. It took 15 minutes to make 2 drinks that were not that good. Many say that this is subjective. I say, never mind the price, the french martini was overly sweet and the mojito was lacking any flavor...with a couple of sprigs of mint. Working in the industry, my column will reflect the lack of care they take on the simplest of pleasures. And let's not even get into the attitude of the server and bartender. They are evidently in the wrong line of work.< /Review>

Unfortunately the other survey only asked for constructive feedback and didnt ask for the highlights of our trip, so I will use this venue to do just that. Great room and service for the money. We were very happy withe platinum upgrades and service. Special shout out to Troy for taking care of us during our stay. We will be back the next time we visit SF this summer.</review>

We only were there one night, but enjoyed the comfortable and quiet room. We were upgraded to a high floor with a beautiful view of the bay! Liked the location near the Ferry Building and Bart station. Some good restuarants in the area also. We will definitely return to this hotel again.</Text>

<Text>Our room was beautiful. The bay view was amazing. It was my husband's birthday and it turned out to be the perfect celebration. We loved the location of the hotel--such a short walk to the Embarcadero, North Beach, Chinatown, Union Square and much more. We enjoyed the Bar 333 and the Park Grill in the hotel.
Josiah checked us in. He was so helpful and friendly throughout our stay. We credit him for our very positive experience at Le Meridien. We look forward to a return visit.<//Text><time>1410048000000<//time><resp>None</resp>< Pictures>

Greeted well by Valet. Check-in very nice and friendly. Room nice and clean...no coffee maker though. 17th floor, beautiful view. Hotel in great location to everything downtown.
Hallway very dirty, I told concierge and by the time we returned, they vacuumed it...the whole hallway. No idea until leaving that restaurant or coffee was on third floor. If I had to pay for internet or over $20 for Valet Parking, I wouldn't stay here. ($57 for parking overnight as a guest is ridiculous and these days, charging for internet service is not acceptable.)< /review>

As a SPG member I received a great room upgrade to a spacious suite from super-friendly front desk staff. The suite was beautifully decorated and modern offering two television, a kitchen and large bath room. I very much enjoyed my stay.

Hotel lobby and entrance area could receive some refurbishment though. Overall a great hotel with nice staff.<//Text>

The lobby of the hotel was nice, but for Starwood it was one of the worst I've stayed in. Again, that is for Starwood so I'm probably splitting hairs. The restaurant was awful and we left before our meal even arrived. staff was unfriendly and lazy. Felt as if we were "putting them out" in ordering lunch. Rooms are small and oddly shaped. Hotel is old and while its been updated it leaves ALOT to be desired. Stay at the Westin Market St. I know I will from now on.. its much nicer.<//text>

This hotel looks attractive, but is so poorly managed that it should be avoided.  We arrived at 1 PM and were told our 2 rooms are not ready because their check-in time is 3 PM.  Perfectly understandable.  We came back at 5, 2 full hours after check-in time and were told sorry, rooms are not ready.  We asked to speak to the manager.  Agnes, the manager on duty, came over, was very rude and said nothing she can do rooms are not ready.  No attempt to accommodate us.  We had plans for the evening and needed to get ready.  We had to wait until 6 for our pre-paid rooms to be ready.  That level of service is completely unacceptable, I certainly will never stay there again and would not recommend anyone else to.</text>

<Review>We stayed at the Le Meridian San Francisco on Wednesday, July 5,2017 while in San Francisco to celebrate our anniversary. We had reserved a room and upon arrival, Agnes greeted us and checked us in. She had a wonderful personality and was very attentive. She gave us the most incredible room with wonderful views!! The room was very large and very clean. We had a very relaxing sleep. A memory we will never forget. Thank you, Agnes, for making the visit special. We only wish there were more people like her!!<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures><Date>1499385600000<//Date><UserId.>None< /UserId.><response>None</response><user_name>pazp</user_name><gmapID>0x8085806033e06771:0x5585cb03086b5f0f<//gmapID><Rate>None<//Rate></record></dataset><record>

<review>My fiancee and I stayed here recently and we couldn't be happier. As a Platinum member, they upgraded us to a brand new suite with a bay view balcony. They're in the process of revamping all the rooms and you will not be disappointed.
We checked out for 2 days and went up to Napa, prior to leaving we asked for the same room upon returning and they had no problem giving it to us. Finally, our flight got canceled (we live in Boston) and they extended us, again without having to move rooms.
The lobby and front desk staff we're great, always greeted with a smile and they remembered who we were.
While it is in the financial district, we walked pretty much everywhere we wanted to go; COIT Tower, Fishermans Wharf, Union Sq, China Town, North Beach...ect, ect. Granted, some of these places are over a mile away so be prepared but it is a great place to stay if you're willing to take a trek (given all the great food in SF, we needed it!).
Look forward to coming back to see these folks again< /review><date>1424563200000</date><user_name>NDuzzi</user_name><Rate>None<//Rate></record></dataset><record>

The Le Meridien in San Francisco has undergone a complete remodel of their lobby and it looks fabulous. When we arrived early they had our room ready, which we had requested. The bay view room had a fantastic view of the Bay Bridge and Treasure Island. The hotel is in a great location right downtown near the Ferry Building. You can walk to many sites or hop on public transportation and see the city.</Text>

My stay at the Le Meridien was wonderful! As a platinum member, I was upgraded to a beautiful suite, which was certainly a nice surprise. Room service was fast and efficient, albeit a bit expensive. I do wish the rooms came with a coffee maker but that is the only amenity that was not covered. Kudos to the Le Meridien for creating a marvelous guest experience from check-in to check out!</Text>

I've always enjoyed staying at the Le Meridien because of its friendly and helpful staff and its proximity to the waterfront. I love starting my day with a run along the Embarcadero. The work areas in room at the hotel are superior to those at many other hotels I frequent in my travels. And although the Le Meridien is slightly off the beaten path if you don't have business in the Financial District, it's an easy walk to North Beach, Chinatown, Union Square and other destinations. I've never had a bad stay here.<//review>

<Review>We were upgraded to a 20th floor room overlooking the bay. Fantastic view and an unbelievably beautiful, and clean room. Loved it!! The staff was friendly and helpful. The only strange occurrence was after we checked in, the staff came to our room looking to inventory the bar? Told her no need to come back.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None</Response>< gmap_id>

< review>
I visit San Francisco regularly but pay a visit to Le Meridien San Francisco the first time which I also believe will be the last one...
Hotel reception or managers are just not available by email. I sent an email ahead of my stay as I had some concerns reading reviews about noise associated with demonstrations they had around the hotel. I wanted to make sure that I am getting high floor room and if possible direction which is away from the expected demonstration. 
I booked a Studio Suite with king size bed.

To get a response from the assistance front desk MGR took 3 reminders as well as 3/4 emails to SPG Platinum Customer Services.... it was very clear at this point that this hotel is poorly managed but as it was a short stay and I arrive late to book another hotel I decided to stay but would gladly share my experience with you so you may have the benefit of knowing in advance what you are to expect.

Front desk assistant confirmed a high floor room, I was allocated 14th floor ( out of 24 floors) I would not call it specifically a very high floor.
I was told that my room was upgraded - yes it was to the next category but ( and there is always a but in this property) with small queen size bed which is very small generally and specifically to a suite.
As SPG life time member I was given breakfast taken which I was told by reception can give a $30 credit. Again when trying it this morning there was a but.... I left the vouchers at the resturant as I have no intention to start my mornings with long discussion about the voucher and the small prints associated with it.... 
no need for the hotel manager to respond. He has ample of opportunities to do so.< /review>

Stayed here for a night since I had job interviews the next day.

Checked in late around 10:30pm, and they gave me a handicap accessible room since they were completely booked.

Accommodation was fine, and the room was clean. Expected some of the furniture to be a bit newer though (eg: TV, ironing board, etc.).

No free wireless, and they serve brunch beginning 6:30am.</text>

We reserved through the SPG website and were not disappointed. We live in the Bay Area and had symphony tickets on the Sat. after Thanksgiving, so decided to check hotels to spend the night for a treat. The Meridien was available and included the parking (which can be a shocker), so we decided we'd spend the night and get a jump on our holiday shopping.
Upon arrival, we were promptly greeted and given keys to our upgraded (jr suite) room with a fabulous view of the bay, Coit tower, Bay Bridge, etc. We were thrilled!!< /Text>

My wife and I are pretty critical of hotels and have stayed in some nice ones around the globe. This one in San Francisco is a nice, simple, clean hotel with friendly service and in a strategically good, but not busy location (as opposed to Union Square). Our room was nicely appointed, bed comfortable and room quiet with a nice view of the TransAmerica building and the Bay. Only drawback and reason for taking away a star on Facilities is the $60 a night parking. Ridiculous.< /Text>

We have been staying at this hotel since before it was a Le Meridien, and it has always been our oasis in San Francisco. The rooms are large and comfortable. They are quiet and the windows have both great views and great black out curtains. The staff is friendly, knowledgeable and hard working. They will go the extra mile. We will definitely be coming back.

Our only complaints are minor. The bathroom has sliding doors which compromise privacy, and the Christmas music in the lobby and elevators was way TOO LOUD. We weren't the only guests to notice this, and it led to some amusing banter in the elevators. We could retreat to our room, but this must have been rough on the staff.</review>

<Date>1379203200000</Date><rate>None< /rate><text>On Feb 20/2013, I called reservation to book 4 rooms and gave my SPG # requesting them to credit all the points to my account for I was paying for all the 4 rooms.

On May 23/2013, I called reservation to book 2 more rooms and gave my SPG # for crediting all the points to my account and again I was paying for all the 6 rooms.

On July 12/2013, I booked 1 more room and also quoted my SPG number for credit.

I specifically mentioned in each of the bookings that all the starwood points to be credited to my SPG account. None of your staff taking my reservation had ever informed me that I could only get points for 3 rooms. Had I known this I would have booked my family members in hotels of their choice to collect reward points of their own.

Starwood hotels should not limit the number of eligible SPG starpoints for family booking. I wanted my family to stay together by offerring to pay for all the 7 rooms but I can only get reward points for only 3 rooms!!! Very disappointed.<//text>< pictures>

<Review>I actively avoid properties that allow smoking anywhere on the premises, and chose to stay at this property in part because it appeared in the SPG search for smoke-free properties. On the Features page, it states "Experience a fresh approach at this Le Méridien – a completely smoke-free environment." and "100% Non-Smoking Rooms and Facilities."

HOWEVER, on the Announcements page it states the REAL policy, which is "All guest rooms and public spaces in the hotel are now 100% non-smoking. A 250 USD penalty will be charged for smoking in guest rooms. Smoking is permitted on outdoor room balconies and on the Park Grill terrace only." The room balconies is a big deal, because some rooms without balconies do have sliding glass doors to the outside, which allows smoke from adjacent rooms' balconies to waft in. It also creates the potential for guest confusion about whether the room has a "balcony" area. When I checked in, I had one of these rooms and it did smell heavily of smoke.

I e-mailed SPG and asked that they update the Features page to remove the deceptive information about the smoking policy.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

If you can get a room, this is a great hotel that does not rely upon limited availability of rooms in the city, rather than focusing on the quality of its amenities.<//Text>

< Review>
I enjoyed my stay in San Francisco but found the overall hotel staff attitude less than accommodating. The front desk and concierge staff were great. But, the room cleaning staff less so. After each visit, I had to request a face towel and wash cloth. One time I returned to the room to pick up a sweater and the woman cleaning demanded to see my ID. I appreciated her concern for security but she needs to work on her "manners." The bar tender was RUDE on each occasion I visited the bar. Finally the bell men demanded payment for helping transport boxes -- understandably they expected payment and they were certainly going to be tipped generously - but unacceptable for them to to demand payment after the fact. When asked about this "demand," their "supervisor" complained about an earlier failure to "tip" when in fact they had been tipped quite generously. While I understand the need for gratuities in a service job, this behavior seems at odds with the image conveyed by the Meridien. Members of the staff came off as a bit greedy and grasping -- not what one expects from an expensive and highly touted hotel. I live on the east coast which is often maligned for its lack of courtesy and gentility. Yet, I have not had this experience in NYC or Boston hotels. Nonetheless, it's a lovely hotel -- though a bit rough around the edges.<//Review>

The room, while sizable, was dark - carpet, walls, drapes. The bathroom was clean, spacious. The bed was comfortable. The internet was easy to connect and worked very well. The toilet's high-powered (think cruise ship) flushing system had some kinks in it and produced a piercing whistling noise that would last until I flushed it again. Five times this happened during the night. The concierge didn't appear surprised, was very kind, and made arrangements to have it fixed. The hotel is convenient to the financial district, the lobby bar is very pleasant, and the waterfront is only blocks away for a great morning run/walk. Ask for a room with a view of the Bay Bridge so you can see the light show at night.< /text>< pictures>

<text>I have enjoyed staying here before but was not made aware that the entire lobby was being remodeled. The entrance was thru a small door and then you took the elevator to the 2nd floor check in. The reception did not offer the bonus points/breakfast, I had to ask. The room had a nice view of the bay. There was only one bathrobe and two towels. The second day a throw rug was in the bathroom. The toilet made a terrible howl when flushed. My husband said we should come back. I think that with the wide choice of Starwood hotels, I will go else where.<//text><Time>1359676800000< /Time><user_name>Chris4< /user_name>< Response>

<Review>$600 per night rate. Nice rooms. Decent service. No coffee machines in the rooms. You can order coffee through room service so that you can be gouged even more. Here's the fun part of not having a $10 coffee machine in the room: You get to wander outside the hotels in the dark and either go to Peets or Starbucks. How great is that!!!

$600 a night and no $10 coffee machine.</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

<rating>None< /rating><Review>I reserved a room with 2 beds, but was told that none were available when I checked in. I was offered a rollaway bed, which turned out to be uncomfortable. I specifically reserved the room at this hotel because there were 2 beds. The room I was given, which was called a "suite", had a beautiful view which we appreciated, but it didn't make up for the uncomfortable bed. We were repeatedly assured that the rollaway was very comfortable, but it just wasn't. The staff seemed unsympathetic about our situation, with the exception of the gentleman that checked us out.

Also, we were told the rollaway bed would be delivered to our room, but when we returned to the hotel after midnight, we discovered it still had not been delivered.

One more thing, there was a dirty towel folded and hanging on the shower, that I discovered was dirty after I used it! So gross, with 2 red blood stains. I assume that if it were washed properly, their might still be stains, but not blood red.

This is a very nice hotel, and I have stayed here before on my own, but I would hesitate to return with a friend expecting 2 beds, and I will check the towels before I blindly grab and use one!<//Review>< Date>

Every inch of this hotel is beautifully maintained and impeccable. The staff was nothing but gracious, kind and responsive throughout the hotel. The location is right in the center of the financial district and is accessible to all areas of the city and just a short distance from the nearest BART station. We stayed here with our toddler (which was obviously not the norm in the financial district) but were still treated as though we were right where we belonged. We stayed a week and it was one of our best vacations. We absolutely recommend this place hands down if it is within your budget.< /Text>

<Review>We were in the city for only one night. Our room was wonderful, the view could have been better, but Le Merdian has no control over neighbors. We got good advice on a dinner location, just a block from the hotel. The staff was very helpful and gracious. We will definitely return to this property in the future.< /Review>< Pictures>

We stayed here for 2 nights and used the hotel as a base to explore the city. It was a great location and the room was very nice. Staff was friendly and helpful. The hotel is renovating the first floor, which was a minor inconvenience, but not too bad. It meant taking two elevators to get to your room. I think they plan on having it finished by January. We would definitely stay again.<//Text>

Called in about cost for parking. They told us 60. When we got there it was 70. We were then told it would be 85. Very disappointing way to start the stay. The room was nice and clean. I would only stay here if you don't have a car.</Review>

I never complain about hotels, and honestly this hotel was a nice place, but for over $400 a night, the issues I had with the internet were too much. I was there for 2.5 days and had a number of business calls. When I first arrived, i couldn't get online, and after the staff telling me for 4 hours that it was fine, someone finally told me internet service had been down for the entire hotel for a few hours with no timetable for return. They told me to go to Starbucks, which I did, and when I came back to check, someone else told me internet had been fine the whole time. When I couldn't log in again, a different person told me they were still having an issue, but would send someone to my room. That person never came, and I was never able to get on. Late night I came back one night and asked about internet, and again, the new staff had no clue and said it must be my computer, even though now multiple other staff members confirmed there were issues. Either way, I just wanted an answer, and options for a solution - which never happened. Horrible experience to be trying to log in for conference calls and having to go to Starbucks and never having a timetable for a solution. Honestly unacceptable for a hotel of this caliber, and for all of the travel that I do for work this was one of the most frustrating experiences I've had.<//text>

Our stay at Le Meridien was very pleasurable. Initially we had a handicapped accessible room (at our request because one of us had a broken ankle) but the accessibility was designed for someone in a wheelchair, not on crutches. We were moved after one day to a junior suite that was excellent in all categories.

The "business center" is minimal and parking is expensive, but other than that everything was great.</Text>

<text>When I travel on business to San Francisco, my hotel of choice is Le Meridien. This establishment has a "boutique" feel, and the staff is always friendly and welcoming.

One item worth noting: during my latest stay at Le Meridien, the bulb was not working in the magnifying mirror in the bathroom. This is minor, but I have experienced this issue before, and for such a top notch hotel, I would expect the housekeeping staff to conduct a QC check at each room cleaning.< /text></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Well, where to begin.....
This was my first stay at a Le Meridien Hotel and I was excited to experience it. Unfortunately, it wasn't a good experience. I stayed there on two separate nights while in town. The first stay we arrived early and I had a confirmed Suite Night Award for an Executive Suite.

I was given a Junior Suite, which we later found out was not entirely clean. The bathroom trashcan still had trash in it from the last guests and it was missing amenities (lotion....)

This was coupled by the fact that one of the cleaning staff walked in on us while we were changing. Needless to say I was less than pleased. I finally decided to go down stairs and speak to someone at the front desk about the situation. I was offered a two free drinks as a consolation prize and they were willing to send someone up to clean the bathroom again.

At this point, I'm presumably in a not completely clean suite that isn't the suite that I was promised and I feel like I'm two for two on language barriers at the front desk. I want to be fair and say that the staff was very polite and offered me a late check out, platinum amenity., but it is difficult when you kinda feel as though you are putting people out.

A manager did move us to the appropriate suite. She stated that she would address the issues with the room, but it honestly soured the experience. (Work/Birthday Weekend)

Round 2 Saturday night......
The same representative checked us in again and again tried to put me in a junior suite. I attempted to explain to her that I had a confirmed Executive Suite, but it fell upon deaf ears. She explained to me that Starwood doesn't know what suites they have available.....
Well, you know things never go well when you have to explain how a program works. I again felt like was imposing my will on the front desk staff. Ultimately she told me if I was willing to wait she would put me in an Premium Suite.
We waited less than 45 minutes and received a Executive Suite. I immediately went to secure my valuables and found the safe was locked. We waited approximately 30 minutes for engineering to come and unlock the safe for us. He was great, but again lack of attention to detail by the house keeping staff.

That evening we went downstairs to enjoy our consolation prize from the first night and ordered two drinks. The bartender was awesome and when I presented the card I was given, she informed me it was only good for one drink. I actually laughed out loud because when the front desk person gave it to me, he said it was good for the both of us. I told him I think they are only good for one drink, but he reassured me it was good for two. (training issue again)

It isn't the money, it's the principal that I used two Suite Night Awards to ensure we received the right room for our needs. It bothers me that I know more about Starwood than some of the staff.

Let me close with a couple of positive thoughts:
The views from the higher floors are great.
The location is great if you are doing business in the financial district.
The bellmen were great and very attentive.
The bartender was funny and made us feel at home.

I tried to be as fair as possible, but I was really disappointed.< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None<//resp><gmapID>0x8085806033e06771:0x5585cb03086b5f0f< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>
<text>I always enjoy my stay at Le Meridien. The employees are solid in all parts of the hotel. In particular, the concierges worked very hard to find a dinner reservation for eight on short notice on a Friday night. They were successful. There is nothing flashy about the rooms, but they are quiet and functional. The hotel is well situated in downtown San Francisco and the fitness center is very nice. My only criticism is the hotel feels the need to play New Age music in the elevators. It really is annoying.<//text><Date>1404259200000</Date><UserId.>None<//UserId.><Rating>None< /Rating>< Gmap_id>

Hotel was nice. Room very comfortable however I like to have coffee in my room and that was not provided. They offer free coffee on the 3rd floor but I prefer to have a pot in my room so I can have coffee while I get ready. The other item I expected was a decent hair dryer.The one I had was not very powerful.< /Text>

A luxury hotel located in the heart of San Francisco's Financial District. The staff was excellent and very helpful. The room was very clean and the bed was one of the most comfortable ones that i've experienced. Can't think of anything negative about the hotel except of the price but for the area i think it's reasonable.<//Review>

Accommodated our dog and family last minute during the Christmas holiday. Clean and quiet on the 15th floor. Wish we didn't have to park our car there as it was quite expensive ($56/night.) Valet was slow in getting our car each time we needed it. Staff was nice and polite. Easy to walk to Chinatown, Embarcadero, Fisherman's Wharf and Union Square.<//review>

We stayed in Room 2201 and the room was modern and great place to stay however there were some service related issues (1) I had a your 24 request approved two weeks before and one day before check in it was canceled (2) had to bring it up to mgr at front desk and she approved it but she didn't offer points or two drink coupons or anything for inconvenience and when I asked for drink coupons she said "I can't do that I already took care of issue " I mean come on drink coupons are 15 bucks each which are nothing. Then when I checked out (mind u at 4 pm because didn't want to stay here longer) the front desk girl asked how was ur stay and when I told her the problems I had see looked at me like deer in head lights and finally said "I am sorry" once again she could have knocked off 100 from bill or given me points and I waited for her to do that but did not do that. This all points to service related issues and management problem.</text>

I had planned a trip to SF this weekend, however, due to the weather conditions and the news reporting that air quality is the worst ever recorded in the area. I had emailed the hotel to cancel my reservation two days ago, however, I was not given a response. I called today and they said they wouldn't be able to refund because I was inside the 48 hour window and would had to have canceled in advance of that. The director of the property told me that they were "living in the area and it was fine" although I mentioned several times that news outlets have said it's unsafe to travel there right now. Long story short, he told me to dispute the charge with my bank because he was not willing to break protocol even with the circumstances. Not only was he not empathetic and didn't help me come to a resolution, he gave me attitude and made me regret even booking there in the first place.<//text>

The room was very spacious and everything worked perfectly. I had a problem with the TV and the technician arrived promptly and solved the problem in minutes. He was amazingly polite and kind. I will give this hotel my best ratings! I stay in hotels all over the country and Le Meridien was one of the very best! Thanks</review>

The room was very nice. The view of the Bay Bridge was incredible! The room lacked a few things that you would normally expect. For example, it didn't have a coffee maker or a wash cloth.</review>

< review>
We were staying in SF for a wedding and requested to check in early because the wedding started before official check in time. Not only did they let us check in early, we got upgraded, which was nice because we paid quite a bit for a room here (it was the weekend of some event too). The room was very clean, we got two keys to the room and the lock seemed a little finicky but it worked...eventually. It was a little loud when people would walk in the hallway, but all of the staff we dealt with were very friendly and professional. We did valet our car so we didn't have to worry about parking and the valet staff was awesome too...oh and 4 stars for room comfort because all of the pillows were too squishy for my comfort...<//review>

<text>Nice hotel that's close to many businesses. Good walking distance to the water. Hotel room was very nice. I got upgraded to a deluxe room and it was pretty big. The bathroom is nice and big with a separate shower from the tub. They provide a good amount of soap, shampoos, etc in case you want to do both a shower and a bath. The TV is pretty huge too, probably a 50 in. They have a comfy robe that you can put on. Overall, it's a hotel that gives you a sense that it's a bit more upscale than traditional SPG hotels.< /text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

Have stayed here twice, and it is consistently clean, comfortable and with friendly staff. Location is also good, close to Embarcadero, financial district etc. Downstairs bar and lobby have been redone and are nice. Restaurant also has great breakfast. My first choice for starwood properties in SF.<//review>

<text>The Le Meridien in San Francisco is my favorite business hotel. I travel almost every week and I get excited when my travels take me to the Le Meridien in San Fran. The staff is very helpful and greets me by name. The new workout room equipment is awesome. The most unique service offered by the hotel is they wash your workout clothes for free every day. If you turn them in on your way to work, they are clean and on your bed when you return. This hotel is fantastic and a great location accessible to all of the great spots in San Francisco!< /text></record></dataset><record>

I needed a suit pressed. I was told by two separate individuals that it could be done in the requested timeframe. I also indicated on the note attached to my suit the need to have the pressing completed by same night. Despite very clear communication with staff and multiple points I still ended up with my suit being brought back to me in its original bag. The front desk manager the next morning was of little or no use. Ironically, my input Via this email was solicited even though I wrote the general manager a specific note Relative to this extensive and systematic lack of good communication and service.< /text>

<Date>1454544000000< /Date><text>Located in the Financial District, for some reason all my Uber and taxi rides dropped me off and picked me up at the bar entrance - not the easiest to drag your luggage through.

Excellent staff and service, especially by Claudia, who is an asset to the hotel. She was able to assist me with each of the room reservations I had for a convention, deliveries, etc.

For the room, each room is designed to have a “corner window” view looking out from the hotel at the Bay Bridge - a great view, and thankfully the patio doors partially open to let some fresh air in.

I shared this room with a co-worker, and found there was more than enough space for each of us to sleep and work, without feeling cramped in a city like downtown San Francisco.

The gym is located in the basement, with several cardio and weight machines - you may be staring at a mirror image of yourself while running, but at least there is lots of TV.</text>< Name>

The first morning I woke up before 8 since there was some construction going on 15 stores below me, but the sound was so loud I couldn't get any more sleep. When I went to have breakfast I was told my room rate did not include breakfast, even though that was what I had chosen. Ended up paying $32 for it. And the construction kept going on next to the breakfast area. Luckily I got a new room for the next night, but lost the view I had paid for. And this night was even worse. There was a suite next to my room and after sleeping for an hour I woke up to the sound of at least 10 drunk people partying in the next room. I had to call the front desk three times but they never managed to make the party stop so in the end they brought me ear plugs so I could have at least a few hours of sleep.< /Review>

Courteous staff and, service is quite good. You’ll also notice the signature Le Meridien scent when you walk through the entrance (an experience they refer to as the transitional portal). The hotel, however, is really beginning to show its age and I must say could use a bit of sprucing up. On the flipside, rooms are pretty spacious, clean and comfortable.< /text>

<text>This is a nice hotel in a great part of town and the staff was mostly helpful. For all those reasons, maximum stars. Getting home, seeing the bill and realizing I was charged $61 per night for valet parking was a huge smack in the face. C'mon! I know parking is expensive in major metros, but this is ridiculous. Add that the amount wasn't mentioned and I'm finding out 2 weeks later just makes matters worse.< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None</Resp><GmapID>0x8085806033e06771:0x5585cb03086b5f0f< /GmapID></record>

Really liked the hotel. Booked the room because we got a good deal through Groupon. After we arrived we saw why it was listed on Groupon: major construction downstairs, no lobby whatsoever. But the location was terrific and the room simple and elegant. We would stay again.<//Review>

Don't  be misled by the French name and pretension.  This place is all American,  right down to the ambivalent service and no frills setting.  And it is LOUD LOUD LOUD.  The hotel is at the corner of two of the busiest streets in San Francisco,  Battery and Cole,  and the windows are not high quality enough to keep out the sound.  So you will be woken up throughout the night,  probably multiple  times.  Street sweepers at 230 am,  honking cars at 4 am,  motorcycles racing at 6 am.  The staff will give you earplugs - -  but only if you ask.  When I finally asked,  they seemed completely unsurprised noise was a problem.  There are other needlessly cheap touches.  No coffee maker in the room for example.  You can get one,  but again only if you request it. And no one apparently volunteered that information to all the foreign tourists walking across the street every morning for Starbucks.< /Review>

We have been staying at this hotel for the last 25 years (about 20 times), dating back before it was a Meridien. We have always liked this hotel. This time was different. The hotel was under renovation, and no advanced warning was provided. Our shower door was missing. I tried to use the shoe polishing service, only to be awakened at 2 AM by a hotel employee asking what time I would like the shoes back! I left a message with the general manager, who did not return my message. This ho0tel has fallen off of a cliff.<//review>

By Meridien standards, rooms tend toward bland and sparsely furnished, but mine was comfortable and fully functional. I appreciated the multiple outlets on the nightstand (this included a direct USB charger) as well as a Bluetooth-enabled radio. The Park Grill is the most inviting of the public spaces but curiously this restaurant is open only for breakfast and lunch. Dinner is confined to the very lively bar; this being San Francisco, it becomes a hardship only in the event rains return to California. A nice feature is a landscaped elevated walkway which extends several blocks to the Embarcadero; no need to cross streets. Light sleepers should also note that there’s a fire company around the corner; consider that source of street noise when choosing a room at check in.<//text><user_name>BillN</user_name>< rating>

The hotel is undergoing renovations causing for an inconvenient temporary lobby location. This in itself is fine. However, I arrived to a very long line and there was no SPG line.

The worst part of my stay was when there was no hot water running. It took quite a while for this to be resolved. As a result I was late for an appointment.

Another disappointing thing was a nap interrupted twice by phone calls, once by housekeeping and once by the front desk, about when housekeeping could come into my room. One call should have been sufficient.</Review>

Centrally located in the Financial District, close to enough good restaurants and a short walk to the Ferry building. Fantastic but pricey breakfast. Lots of great hotel options in SF but Le Meridian is a good value. Participate in SPG promos but I havent had success with upgrades.< /review>

Very nice fancy hotel. Comparable to higher end Marriotts and Sheratons. No free WiFi and breakfast like Holiday Inns and Best Westerns. Decor and service was excellent.<//text>

Super location, close to Bart, Chinatown, Little Italy and the Farmer'sMarket. Very quiet hotel. Like a boutique hotel. Karim, the Server at breakfast was very friendly and personable along with the rest of the brerakfast staff. Breakfast was always excellent. The Gm upgraded us to a Suite. Thank you. The only negative was on the last day the mgr. on duty, Heath, was grumpy, rude and condescending when I asked him to review an error on our bill. Definitely would stay here again. Pleases retrain Heath.< /Text>

<Text>What a great experience I had during my brief stay at Le Meridien! From the minute I walked in, I knew this would be a different experience. The rooms are over the top and the dining was top notch. Le Meridien is located in the Financial District making it very convenient to my business destinations as well as all the places in the City I like to entertain.</Text><Pics>None</Pics><response>None<//response>< gmap_id>

With the drilling and construction noise everywhere, the hotel did everything possible to make our stay a good one. Can't wait to go there again after the drilling and banging is over. It's a lovely site and the location is awesome. Your staff was amazing.< /review>

< Review>
Great hotel but the service and treatment ruined the experience. Initially put me in an accessible room with no counter space in bathroom and roll in shower that hit me in chest and flooded the room. Said they would move me while I was out. They didn't. Gave me new room. Keys didn't work, back downstairs etc. Had to check a bag and took more than a half hour to get it back when I had to leave for SFO to catch my plane. No SPG line and then the desk clerk waited on people who just walked up and cut in front of me and the others waiting in line. Really nice hotel with real potential but it is run really poorly!!!!<//Review>

Everything was wonderful. The balcony overlooking The Bay Bridge with it's light show, the bathroom was very large with a very large vanity, the 2 TV's were nice to have but not used on this stay and the bed was perfect!
Also, all the staff we came across was very helpful especially the Valet guys who had my car ready by 6 am before I called down.
I will stay here again.<//text>

Well located in DT SF for business travelers and tourists, it's walking distance from the Ferry Building and several large businesses. The rooms are well sized, however be aware that there aren't traditional "business" style desks in the rooms. Instead, there are high bench style desks with tall seats - making spending long hours in the room working not as comfortable as it could be. The staff are incredibly helpful, helping make sure you're comfortable and enjoying your stay. A great hotel for those staying in SF!< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

Every time we come to the city, we stay here. The hotel is centrally located in North Beach and the rooms and views are unbeatable. Because of the corner windows in EVERY room, our views were of the Bay Bridge, Alcatraz and Transamerica building. The staff is very professional and Club 333 has a good happy hour with chardonnay, cabernet, and martinis for $6. I felt the parking for $60 per night was a little pricey but it's expensive anywhere in the city.<//text>

<Resp>None<//Resp><text>The hotel was very nice and the staff was very accommodating. The only real negative was the breakfast buffet on Sunday. The food was very limited and all of it was COLD. We asked twice for toast before getting it - and then it arrived without any butter. Couldn't ever get a second cup of coffee, so had to help myself. It wasn't that busy, since most customers were using the self service buffet, but the service was not just bad, it was non existent - for $21.< /text></record>

I did like the view and location of hotel, about 20 walk to Fisherman's Pier area. The room was nice, and liked the extra office room that I used, but it's a little outdated. It was reasonably priced for SF. Again, liked it-just very average. It's probably better to stay for a company function, not a romantic get away.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

Lemerdien San Francisco is OK, but nothing more. The Financial district isn’t the most interesting place in SF, and in the evening the area is rather quiet. Rooms are reasonably sized and relatively up to date except for the bathrooms that could do with a touch-up. The noise from traffic is rather loud. Both the front desk staff as well as the waiters in the restaurant were efficient, but nothing more. The breakfast buffet is fairly limited and rather expensive so nothing to brag about.< /Review>

I've stayed here a few times and it's always terrific. This trip, Chris at the check in desk set a record for greeting me, registration, and handing me my key in under 2 minutes. Loved it! He couldn't have been nicer and to boot I scored a great room upgrade. 

If you're addicted to coffee, beware if you ask for an in-room machine. The pods they use aren't good and often leak. Better to just head to the Starbucks across the street.< /review>

I have been a repeat customer of this property (expenditure of over $10k), and normally both the hotel and staff are great!

But, during my stay on Halloween weekend, my opinion was tarnished by a night "Manager" at the Front Desk. I only had a simple request for the SPG late check-out, and it was denied due to my appearence while in my Halloween costume. In my 14 years with SPG, never has this request been denied unless there is a lack of availability. Worse, she made me feel like I was making an unreasonable request, even though my profile explicitly states that I am qualifed.

When I made the exact same request with another rep over the phone, it was fulfilled without any questions.</Text>

<Text>I've always had very good experiences at this hotel, very good location, just enough out of the main flow of the downtown SF riff raft to make you feel safe stepping out of the front lobby. The staff was ALWAYS super friendly, helpful. The rooms are VERY comfortable. My favorite place to stay in the downtown SF area for the money.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><date>1325203200000< /date><Rating>None</Rating><Resp>None</Resp><username>Ckmartinez</username><user_id>None< /user_id><GmapID>0x8085806033e06771:0x5585cb03086b5f0f</GmapID></record>

Beautiful room with a good view. Very good location in San Francisco. Courteous staff. Only negative was the outrageously priced restaurant. ($14 for toast or a bagel?!) As a result, we ate all of our meals off site.</text>

Very nice hotel. Classy, clean, friendly, well placed in the financial district. Quite room, solid wifi, in-room service was fresh and quick with good portions. Clam chowder was amazing. Big tv and AMAZING view from floor 22 facing north. Will return!< /text>

The flat sheet for our king bed was too small to adequately be tucked in on all sides. As you know, this results in the sheet wrinkling under you as you sleep. I requested a fitted sheet, but was told that they didn't have fitted sheets. They told me the flat sheet that was supplied was the largest they had. They offered to send up an additional flat sheet, but I couldn't see how that would be helpful. Other than that, our room was spacious, well appointed and very comfortable. They got all of the other details right!< /Text>

<review>In the midst of renovation (front desk), so it was hard to find the front desk. 2 elevators to the ground floor. No complimentary water as with SPG.

Lighting in room was funky. Some was out (2 bulbs including over tub), and the rest - controlled by switch at door, and as it was a junior suite, the lights in question were all the way across and around corner by window. Heating was either too hot or too cold and noisy.<//review>< Name>

My overall experience was very nice. The room was very comfortable but it was quite loud since the windows did not block as must noise as I had expected. We were not allowed to get a rollaway bed and the lady checking me in was fairly rude. Everyone else was very friendly. I would still stay at this hotel again.<//Text>

<text>Location is great for family vacationing, even though it is in the financial district.
Had a minor problem (sliding glass door to outside was off tracks, so it would not close) immediately after checking in. Night manager and staff responded quickly and fixed the problem in my suite, and also provided a room service credit for my problems.
Concierge (DK) was great in helping my family on our vacation. His help included identifying things to do, buying tickets, and recommending restaurants.<//text><Rate>None<//Rate>< gmap_id>

I got a really good deal with Priceline and my check in was very late like around midnight, but went very smoothly executed by the friendly front desk staff. Very quiet, peaceful, and relaxing atmosphere, luxurious comfortable bed, with lots of pillows, and warm down comforter. Great big flat screen TV with lots of channels I woke up on a Sunday morning and found my self watching a.premier league match which I rarely have opportunity for, so greatly appreciated that. Located in the financial district, which is an an excellent location in my opinion, better and safer area, than say Mission or Civic areas. Easy to walk to everything, north beach, union square, ferry building all very close, and embarcadero center right across the street, couldn't really ask for more location wise. Would surely love to stay here again as the need arises, highly recommend!<//Review>< pictures>

Hotel is well located, walking distance to Union square. The room was good, spacious and well decorated. 

Staff at the front desk has NO SPG recognition at all. Rude and impatient. The breakfast is terrible with very limited choices.</Text>

<Text>Upon arrival to my room I noticed the A/C was not working properly. The front desk sent a facilities person to my room to "look" at the unit. However, this did not fix the probelm. I spoke directly to the manager who said the issue would be resolved. When returned to my room at 10:30 that evening, it still had not been addressed. The front desk offered to send a fan to my room. This is not what I exepected from this hotel and I would have little reason to return.<//Text><resp>None<//resp>< Pics>

< review>
The front desk staff at this hotel was one of the rudest and most unprofessional I have ever encountered. The gentleman that checked me in greeted me with silence (and a frown) and did not respond when I greeted him. I asked specifically for a quiet room away from elevators and he gave me a room directly across from an elevator. He also never acknowledged my SPG membership in any way. 

I had the unfortunate luck to encounter him again when I checked out. Again, he handed me my bill in complete silence without so much as a thank you for staying there. They would benefit from some intensive customer service skills training for their staff. For a hotel that charges over $300 per night, I was shocked by the unprofessionalism.< /review>

<time>1512259200000</time><review>Certainly not one of my better experiences at an SPG property. I arrived early knowing the room wouldn’t be ready which was fine. After a few hours I received an alert from the SPG app notifying me that my room was ready and I still didn’t return to the hotel for another hour after that and the check in desk told me that it was incorrect and two different employees went as far as asking to see the message from the app which I showed them. They acknowledged the error and found me a room that was ready. After I got to the room we waited 20 minutes for the bags to be brought up only to find out they were not our bags. The stay ended at the park grill waiting for over 10 minutes for the waitress to even come to the table for our order. The room itself as well as the property were nice but the customer service needs some work.< /review>< gmap_id>

this was my first stay at the san francisco le meridien hotel. my wife and i arrived from a flight from honolulu early morning of the 9th of may. tried to check in but rooms were not available. mr. j . martinez was able to expedite room cleaning for our soon-to-be assigned room. after an hours wait, our room was ready. mr. martinez searched for us in the hotel lobby with our room key and escorted my wife and i took our room. it was immaculate and well appointed. i was very impressed with mr. j. martinez and his hospitality.< /text>

<Rate>None< /Rate><text>Lifetime Platinum here, FIRST review of any hotel. This hotel has protesters that come with bull horns at 7:00 AM. The hotel manager seems to be unaware of CA PC 401C, and says that they "lost in court". I got conflicting stories from different employees of the hotel, but this manager seems sympathetic to their cause, so I suspect things won't change any time soon. I am also told that "all our guests are platinum", so no accommodations will be made for you other than the bare minimum of what SPG requires. Avoid this place!< /text>< Pictures>

First time staying at a Le Meridien and I was definitely impressed. 21st floor view of the GG bridge in the distance, Bay bridge to the right. Room was more than adequate and especially thought the concierges were impressive.
I would rate this a 4.5 overall and would recommend to anyone.<//review>

If you’re considering either staying or doing a conference and/or contact with this hotel, AVOID at all costs. Let me just take a second to publicly shame the management of this hotel. The Le Meridien brand should be absolutely embarrassed to have some completely inconsiderate and non-understanding employees working for them. I hope that the Marriott parent brand sees this review and takes note of how horrific an experience I had with its employees. They consistently ghosted my phone calls and refused to negotiate, or work with me during a very tough personal circumstance I had.

Let’s explain what happened.... So I had a contract for a YEAR in advance, yes that is one full year for a room block during one of the busiest weeks in San Francisco – Oracle OpenWorld. While I had paid a small deposit, Le Meridien San Francisco then proceeded to STEAL $8,835 from me, yes again that is EIGHT THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE DOLLARS charged to my credit card for absolutely no services rendered with ONE full year’s notice of cancellation. Now, here is why they are completely unethical and wrong for doing so…. Under California state law, where a consumer enters into an adhesive contract, it is unconscionable to condition that process on the consumer posting fees he or she cannot pay. Also under of California’s Consumer Legal Remedies Act, inserting an unconscionable provision in a contract is an unfair method of competition. The hotel is in violation and it is keeping my revenue and then getting revenue it will receive for the room blocks filled during those dates.

The Le Meridien San Francisco is responsible for completely bullying me out of my $8,835 and as a large corporation should be called out and ashamed. When trying to get in touch with its legal department or someone with clout on this matter I was again completely avoided and ghosted by the hotel after calling numerous times – it’s funny how then when I called under another pretense saying I needed to book a venue and/or room block they picked up right away.

Never again should anyone reading this or anyone that enters into a contract with this hotel suffer the same kind of abuse that I went through. The Hotel staff, General manager, Marriott, Le Meridien if you are reading this please consider contacting me and making me whole for this matter or I will be forced to reconsider all of my options and how to proceed from here…. Travelers there are so many other nice neighboring hotels I'd highly recommend staying there and avoid this property.</text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>{'time': 1547130328852, 'text': 'Mr. Katzman,\n\nThe Le Meridien San Francisco team values the opportunity to have worked with you regarding your cancellation over the past week. While it is unfortunate you were put in a situation where you requested to cancel the contracted group block of hotel rooms, however we enter contractual agreements to protect all parties involved when securing group rooms or event space. We sincerely hope to have the opportunity to work together again in the future. Please feel free to contact our General Manager if our team may further assist.'}< /Response>< GmapID>

1. Staff at reception not fully aware of SPG benefits entitlement
2. The room was a major let down - decor dated back to 1970s, stationery was used by previous guest, missing what in my mind as basic (coffee/tea/kettle, slippers, bottled water)
3. Where's the art?
4. Breakfast - waited 15 minutes for someone to attend to me

But the fact that there is paid WiFi is a bit silly in the tech capital of the world and it's rather price! $13 per day! Every hotel offers free WiFi and in the year 2017, it's a bit backward that there is a free.< /Text><username>Arash Barkhodaee< /username>< Rate>

Couple of issues this time:
- spg gold Internet password did not work. Spent 30 minutes on the phone with technical support who ended up telling me only platinum applies for free Internet. Front desk then told me to just charge it and it would not appear on the bill. Final bill came with all the charges on it. Had to ask for charge removal. Just a lot of my time wasted...
- bar has a very limited wine list
- rooms, particularly bathroom, needs to be renovated
- no hbo in the room< /review><Response>None<//Response>< date>

<Review>Really loved staying at this hotel. I loved the way it was decorated. It is very modern and tasteful. Great room, spacious, clean. Had a great view with a sliding door that only budged a little but I understand that is for safety reasons. The customer service was above average, everyone was extremely nice and helpful. Great bar, everything is very clean. The reason I gave it a 4 instead of a 5. This was my first time staying at this hotel and my first time in San Francisco. Finding the hotel was easy but figuring out where to go for parking was very frustrating. The only parking available at the hotel was thru valet which cost $62 a night. There was a parking garage down the street, which was around $32 a night. Obviously if you used the parking garage, you would have to walk the street with your luggage and who knows where you would have parked in the garage. We choose to do the valet parking. When I called to confirm my reservations a few weeks prior, it just would have been nice to know the parking situations and have a heads up prior to going and finding out.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

We stayed three nights at the hotel and had a very enjoyable experience. The room was excellent, very spacious and a great view over the City and the Bay. The staff were very helpful and took the time to treat you like a person. We did the buffet breakfast on two mornings and found it to be high quality and good value. Only one complaint - please get some new bath towels. In a hotel of your standard, it is sad that on one day, two out of the three bath towels in our room had holes in them and in general, all the bath towels were thin and a bit threadbare. Time for a restock, I would suggest!< /Review>

No pool, lobby small, parking is sixty two a night.
Bed is smaller than full size vice the two queen advertised. The only good things about this hotel is doorman is extremely nice, vallet man nice, and Starbucks right across. NEVER AGAIN<//Review><username>Tourist82</username><Resp>None<//Resp>< Pics>

Le Meridien is in San Francisco's Financial District and close to the Ferry Building, North Beach, Jackson Square, Chinatown, and buses to Marin County and Berkeley. Rooms are recently updated and look like the stock photos that are shown online. Staff is nice and efficient. Rooms can be expensive depending on when you're visiting but are worth it.<//Text>

My stay was extremely disappointing. First, the room was dirty (dirt and stains on the nightstands and tables, etc.) as if housekeeping had simply made the beds and moved onto the next room. I happened to forget my phone charger, so I called down to the front desk for help—they had none. No charging block to borrow for a deposit, no lost and found I could raid for the night, and certainly no replacement cords they had on hand for this very predictable issue. To top it off, I woke to the sounds of a picket line yelling about jobs at 6 a.m. The service was subpar, and I will find somewhere else to stay when I’m in San Francisco again.<//Review>

<Rating>None<//Rating><Text>We checked in Friday and received an ok room (not overly big or small). I'm a Plat member, was hoping to get upgraded. But not a big deal.

However, what was the big deal was that we were woken up around 7am this morning with protesters outside. We didn't know what the heck it was until a little later - it was strikers against the hotel. Needless to say, not a full night's sleep. Extremely unhappy. We used cash and points to stay here last night. With the unsettled sleep they should refund back the points that we spent to stay here.

The "free" breakfast we were supposed to get, ending up costing us about $23 dollars (coffee is $5.75). What's funny is you can pour your own free at the entrance to the restaurant, but once you sit down the exact same cup is $5.75/each.

I stayed here a number of months ago, loved the property. This time I"m a little more unsettled by it.<//Text>< pics>

<review>We waited over 30 minutes for the hotel to call a cab. Valet was full and said it would take over 20 minutes for us to get our car returned. Staff was not responsive or helpful in such a stressful situation. Due to a lack of our car or the cab, we were late to dinner and had lost our reservation. At a hotel such as this I would expect better service to help accommodate us.<//review>< response>

The only complaint I have of this hotel is that every time I check out, I receive a charge after I have left for the mini-bar. I do not use mini-bars. This has happened twice to me at this hotel. They need a better system for tracking their mini-bar inventory so that they do not charge the wrong guest for usage.</text>

A group of picketers outside the hotel room, giving arriving and leaving guests a hassle about not staying at Le Meridian.

<Text>Although the lobby is being renovated, which makes it a bit difficult, everyone was so helpful. It was a bit of a pain needing to go up and down the single elevator and having the entrance moved but loved the room, and the service. Only issue was when I left. I had stored a bag and valet parked. The valet told me I would have to ride back up the elevator to have them get my bag. Not service oriented and a hotel staff member told me same thing. Once I told him it was not acceptable he went and got the bag for me. That was my only issue.</Text><date>1355616000000<//date><Rate>None</Rate></record>

Enjoyed experience.Staff friendly and location is a plus. R'cvd upgrade with minimal payment and view was spectacular. Very comfy beds. Yes parking super expensive but knew that before booking.< /review>

I live in the Bay Area and have stayed at Le Meridien in the Embarcadero many times for weekend getaways with my wife. I made a reservation online through SPG. All seemed OK until we arrived and saw that the entire lobby ground floor and restaurant was closed for construction. We had to enter a service elevator and go up to the second floor where we checked into a temporary lobby area. We did get upgraded to a very nice top floor room. When I made the reservation there was no mention of the renovation nor the issue with the lobby and restaurant. I'm not sure how long the construction will last, but I recommend anyone check with the hotel if having a nice lobby and place to eat and relax on site is important to your stay.< /text><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None<//Resp><gmapID>0x8085806033e06771:0x5585cb03086b5f0f<//gmapID></record>

<Date>1348384811903</Date><rating>3<//rating><Review>Overpriced luxury hotel. Nothing special to report. I stayed in an executive bay view room on the 16th floor. I probably overpaid because the hotels were overbooked for a conference. The facilities were good. No coffee maker in the room but I didn't mind going downstairs for coffee. Nice big closet, big bathroom and adequate working space. The TV allows for aux connections which is nice and not always the norm in hotel TVs. The service was definitely above par. I was always met with smiling faces and the concierge helped me ship some things back home on my last day.</Review>< pics>

Decent enough place. Had a bad first night: bath robe was dirty, received a call from the front desk at 2am and house keeping at 6:30am. But... They made up for it with an upgrade to a high level suite. Much more comfortable and I'm willing to believe those were a series of unfortunate coincidences.<//Text>

With over 400 nights at Starwood Properties the past 15 years, Sometimes you can get your reservation dates mixed up.

During a recent visit after a very long trip with my family, I realized I booked my reservations for the wrong day and showed up a day early.

Kathryn and Josiah made extraordinary efforts to accommodate our needs without causing any embarrassing moments for "super dad"

Starwood Properties and Staff are the best in the business.</text>< pictures>

Pro: Staffs are generally accommodating and responsive.

Con: Walls are super thin, you can literally hear everything next door- and the people staying next door weren't even that loud. There will be no privacy. Period. I was awaken several times during the night because of the noise from next door.< /Text>

The hotel was in a mostly central location for everything we wanted to do in San Francisco, and in a nicer part of town too. The staff was very courteous and helpful. The only thing that might be a complaint is that the sink water gets really hot really quick.<//review>

Only 2 staff among a few that I spoke to was at a 5 Star luxury hotel level. The guy who checked me in and the concierge was at the said level.
Others especially the other reception staff was not friendly at all.
Toiletries given are at a 3 star hotel level.
Room cleaniness was questionable.

I will not go back to this hotel.< /review>

hopeless, i mentioned to the concierge i left my prescription glasses in back of a cab and she worked every angle she could think of to re-unite me with me glasses. She went waaayyyy beyond just trying to help. It was as if everything depended on me getting those glasses back. alas, yellow cab not so helpful but wow. she took the personal interest and it did not go unoticed. She made me a firm believer in the chain and that specific location. ill be back without a doubt.</Review>

<review>My stay was nice. I liked the modern interior. It was clean and vibrant. My room was nice also. A nice bed and desk and bathroom with granite and terrazzo. Lots of hangers for putting up a weeks worth of clothes. I had a great view from the corner room too.

The only downside was the stinking protesters. They were on a bullhorn for an hour starting at 7:00 am and trash talking the hotel guests. "Don't check-in, Check-out. Hey you on the 9th floor looking out the window, you suck for staying here."<//review><username>Brian Gautreau< /username><pics>None< /pics><rate>4< /rate><user>102981415850966923268</user>< response>

<text>I stayed here for two nights (4/19 and 4/20) and was woken up every morning by protests because this hotel refuses

The hotel is dated. The air conditioning is noisy and you could hear people walking outside the door or turning on the faucets. Bottles of water are not replenished daily and I had to keep on asking for them. The quality of towels is also poor, which is not I expected from a premium SPG hotel. However when needed, the service from the staffs is kind and attentive.</review>

Nicely decorated rooms. Very clean. We had a partial water view (lol). Parking is expensive but that is expected. The valet uses the garage nearby so if you want to save a little money you can self park.</review>

Le Meridien is a good choice centrally located near the Embarcadero Center. The hotel is focused primarily on business travelers and provides all the necessary staples: a good restaurant serving a breakfast and lunch and a fairly good bar scene.  The bar presents a respectable menu (the burger was above average) and some good locals beers.  It could benefit from staying open a little later than the 11:30 closing.  The gym is above average with multiple fitness machines and some free weights.  This would benefit from a upgrade in free weights, though there may not be enough space.  Rooms are spacious and clean and the staff is pleasant and professional.  All in all, this is a good bet for business travel.<//text>

<review>usually sleep around on my hotel choices when in SF, finding the right mix of location, price, and comfort. This time required some extra space, as I wanted to host some local friends for a small New Year's Eve gathering.

Upon arrival, as a Platinum Elite Marriott member, I was upgraded to a Hospitality Suite, which sounded great but wasn't much of an upgrade in my opinion. While it was larger than the suite we booked, the sleeping area was open to the living room, view was not great, and there was no balcony. After a quick call down, we were set up in our Bay-facing balcony suite. We loved the separate room with a door, floor-to-ceiling windows, great view of the Bay Bridge from both balcony and beautiful bathroom window.

This is not a 5* property, so expectations were set accordingly. While the room itself gets solid marks, it was showing some wear in places, especially in carpeting and drapery. Service was a mixed bag. On a positive note, the front desk allowed me return unused breakfast vouchers, giving me Marriott Rewards points instead. I wish Marriott would give this as a credit to be used in any way (e.g., room service), but I digress. Some of the less desirable service interactions included a room service rep hanging up on me (to be fair, it was right before the 11am breakfast deadline.....but still); not receiving requested items on two occasions (plate set and cutlery); and just a general tone of inconvenience when calling to request anything. In-person interactions we much more pleasant -- front desk, bellmen, doorman (set up during New Year's Eve asking for key cards, which was much appreciated).

I'd stay here again if the price is right and am in need of a larger suite (hard to come by in SF...shock!), but with all the choices in and around SF, this may end up being a one-off.

Pro Tip: Eggs Benedict and Corn Flakes French Toast from room service....you won't be sorry!<//review><rating>3</rating>< name>

This stay was a little problematic. First, the lobby was under construction but I anticipate that this will turn out well. Second, I noticed small signs of wear and tear in my room.

I am sure that these will be remedied.,< /Text>< rating>

I have been to this hotel a few times and usually I'm pretty happy but this time I was very surprised at how unhappy I was with housekeeping. I came in on a Monday and did not have a do not disturb, instead I had the tag that stated I don't need housekeeping so I put that out. On Tuesday Housekeeping came to my room and knocked 5 different times to clean the room...each time I told them to come at 11:30am. On Wednesday again housekeeping came 3 different times to which I asked them not to come until later. I called to tell the front desk. They stated they would send a DND but I did not get it so I eneded up going downstairs to complain and then finally received a DND sign. On the days I did not have the DND sign up housekeeping did not even come in the room to clean or make the bed. I was not happy with all this...the first couple days I couldn't do anything to keep them away and then the last two days they never showed up!</review>

The friendly,professional staff coupled with an environment with soothing colors and hues throughout the property made the hotel experience second to none.

Hotel was great except for a few maintenance issues. The toilet ran almost non stop. In water deprived California this surprised me And a very very minor issue was a light with a burned out bulb. The staff went out of their way to be helpful. The room was a bit noisy even on the 16th floor but that was part of being downtown in a big city. I was surprised at the limited restaurant facilities but our needs were met.</Review>

<Review>Mixed review here, the concierge was excellent on Saturday Night he really knew the surroundings went out of his way to guide us, fantastic. I did not get his name.
The front desk check in was not good, the room key did not work had to come back down twice and still the key did not work. Finally they had to let us in with a master key. Was frustrating as we checked in late Friday at 11:30 pm and we just wanted to get to bed.
Should have included free breakfast.</Review></record>

<Review>I selected this hotel for our 44th anniversary, wanting it to be special and memorable. The disappointment is with the construction we were unaware of. Having to go to our rooms through a freight elevator after we transferred to the regular elevator on the second floor actually made me feel embarrassed in front of my bride of 44 years. I understand that construction might have been necessary and it was just bad luck for it to coincide with my visit but his is not the special treatment I had in mind for our special occasion.
It would have been appropriate to have been forewarned of the situation.
However, the positive reviews posted do accurately reflect the amenities but I wish we could have seen the inside of the lobby.<//Review>< time>

<rate>None<//rate><text>Suggest having a water kettle in the room for guests who may need boiled hot water as some of us we need to drink warm water or need hot water to prepare hot drinks. I requested for one but was told there isn't any but was asked to use the coffee percolator to boil water. As coffee leaves strong taste and smell it was not pleasant to drink warm water flavoured with old coffee smell.

Even if you don't put the kettle on every room, at least have some available when guests have a need of it.

Towels were old and had greyish stains (mold stains?)

Also the in room dining menu could be expanded. There were not enough choices.</text></record></dataset><record>

We had a great stay. The location was perfect for what our plans were in the city last weekend.

The only draw back was the delay with valet upon checkout. They weren't taking calls and because the lobby was under construction we had to wait out in the cold for at least 15 minutes. There were quite a few people waiting.< /Text>

This has been one of our go-to hotels for trips to SF, but lately the rooms are starting to show their age. The air conditioning system was so loud, I had to turn it off at night so I could sleep. The mattress does not live up to the typical Starwood quality - mine had a depression like it was 20 years old.
The new lobby/bar area is nice, but not enough to overcome the rooms' shortfall.< /review>

Ridiculous.....The management agreed to provide microwave in room - not provided.  The management agreed to provide drinks coupons complimentary - not provided. Worst is that the clock in the room was not corrected and it constantly showed time difference of 2 hours instead of 3 with EST.  This shows the apathy of the hotel staff.  Would not recommend.<//Review>

We came in for the 2014 San Francisco Marathon and stayed at the hotel. We fully recommend this hotel for its comfort and level.

The hotel is very close to the race start and right in the middle of downtown, which is very quiet for a big US city.<//review>

<Text>The rooms are always very clean and comfortable. Unfortunately, it seems that every time I check in during the evening, because the hotel is always sold out, I am always assigned a double bed instead of my requested King. It almost seems that I'm just given the last room available. It also didn't help that I was an SPG member.<//Text>< username>

The location is pretty close to pier 19 and not to far from market street which is popular. It offers a resteraunt and breakfast, but it isn't cheap. Other resteraunts you might rather visit will be a mile or so away. Parking isn't very essential at this hotel. I paid for over night parking since I could find any for free with the hotel. The hotel parked my car for me for the night for $62. The rooms are great and comfortable beds. Overall great hotel.</Text>

I have stayed at Le Meredian hotels but never at this one. NO WHERE did they mention that they are doing a remodel AKA jack hammering all day long. NO RESTAURANT NO BAR. SO inconvenient. They said it will be gorgeous in 3 weeks. I am not coming back in 3 weeks. I wanted a great experience today. NOT Cool. I could have stayed elsewhere during their LOUD and messy remodel.<//Text>

We chose this hotel because of its location – proximity to shopping, restaurants and sight seeing and very good prepaid rates for the 3 day stay at the expensive hotel. King size room was clean and staff is courteous. It was pretty quiet on the floor with exceptions of the neighbors slamming their doors in and out way past midnight time – everyone should be conscious of other people</Review>

We were a bit worried about staying at this property since reviews on this site and others mentioned problems. What got our attention the most was the reported poor customer service and lack of recognition of Starwood Preferred Guest status.

LET ME TELL YOU, WE HAD NONE OF THESE ISSUES!!

We were greeted cordially at checkin and our Starwood status was recognized and rewarded with an upgrade to a corner room with a balcony that was awesome, facing the bay! From every moment we encountered a staff member, we were treated like valued customers. I don't know if the hotel recently did training on this, but it seemed to be throughout the hotel that every member greeted us and asked if there was anything they could do to make it better.

However, there were challenges that were met with wonderful reactions and offers to compensate. For example, it seemed at one point (totally by our misunderstanding) that someone (employee) had entered the room without permission. The hotel's security took this VERY seriously and checked every logged entry into the room via the electronic key system at our door. They provided a detailed record of every entry since we had checked in. We then figured out our error, but the hotel STILL offered to move us to another room. They never downplayed our fears (which sounded crazy, but were merely mistaken).

My wife ordered room service that wasn't quite right (a food allergy/sensitivity issue). When she called to report it, they took the charge off of our room and sent a proper replacement. When we asked about not having a coffee maker in the room (not a standard feature), they brought one immediately. Further, due to these issues, they gave us a very generous bump in our SPG points.

Overall, I would say that the hotel has excellent customer service and perhaps has made some big changes, we did not see ANY of the "negative" issues reported previously.

We would gladly stay here again!</Text>

<Text>I arrived at this hotel after a long international flight on points and requested an early check in as I was leaving 5am the following day for another flight.I arrived at the hotel at 8AM and the room was not ready, which I understand. The front desk staff said, we have rooms available but those are for higher priority guests where we have contracts to honor their requests. Granted I am only SPG gold, I thought that was comment was not professional and not what I wanted to hear after 12 hours of travel. I feel asleep in the lobby and two hours later- a room was available. Great!

I got to my room and after writing some emails and I went to take a nap. I got in my the bed and there was a used condom on the side of the bed. Gross! I called the front desk and they seemed non empathetic about the situation. They said they would send housekeeping up but I requested a new room (which they honored, but did not seem friendly about it) The new room was fine, but was lacking a bath robe. When I called to ask for one, they informed me they ran out of all bath robes. Again, not too big a deal, just expected more from this type of hotel.

I have concerns about the hygiene and cleanliness of the hotel rooms. I am also surprised that no one followed up to check to see the new room was OK or apologize for the getting in bed with a used condom. Poor service and cleaninless will make me or want to visit this hotel again. Should have spent my rewards points on the Sheraton or Westin.< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None<//response><gmapID>0x8085806033e06771:0x5585cb03086b5f0f< /gmapID></record>

<text>The price point is way off for this hotel.  I've stayed here twice and I always feel myself ask, "why didn't I stay somewhere else?"  Needless to say, this will be the last.

The room is what you would expect from a 4 star hotel - except there are obvious signs of wear and tear that would be expected in a 3 star - peeling wall paper everywhere - and NO LIGHT SWITCHES to control the main lights of the room, which happen to be the reading lights hanging over the nightstand...poorly designed lighting all around.

This place has all of the hi-tech connectivity options with exception for the chords.  The hotel staff won't provide them either which makes most of the fancy connectivity options useless.

The valet is mixed: some are great and others didn't even help me load my bags.</text>< Pictures>

Pretty good place to stay but a bit on the pricey side. I still don't understand why they don't use fitted sheets on the bed. They always come untucked and then you're touching the mattress... Gross.< /Review>

< Review>
Major construction across street and and management was clueless or didn't care. Jackhammers at 730a sat and Sunday. Also had to jump thru hoops to make legal change to a prepaid rate even tho revenue manager agreed was within terms of rate. Said just didn't want to lose extra night. Very nice balcony in room but ours had no chairs. Not up to par at all for brand.< /Review>

<review>I’ve stayed at SPG properties 120 nights this year. This has been the worst night I’ve had this year. First of all upon arrival there were no rooms available (which is fine) but when the lady checked me in she said that three other people had checked in before me who didn’t have status. Why would you say that and then tell me no rooms are available?Being ambassador status and requesting a 12pm checkin I found it rude that the lady who was checking me in said that “I was accusing her of lying “ when I asked her to double check if rooms were available. I was never asked what I wanted me platinum gift to be. So I assume I got the 500 points ? There was no platinum line check in. When I went to talk to the manager on duty I was told to leave my number and that she would call me later. I never received a cal where I was able to voice my concerns. Overall disappointing stay and I don’t recommend his property for plats.< /review>< user_id>

Variety / selection / quality of food lacking. Park Tavern in need of significant upgrading. With so few quality destinations nearby, the hotel has an opportunity to have a "destination" spot for food but falls far short in this category.

The health club is respectable but could be bigger.< /review>

<Text>The hotel is great with a great location. The staff was friendly and the concierge was very helpful. However, the $60 per night parking charge is ridiculous. I understand that it is a downtown hotel and parking is at a premium, but $60 is gouging. However, there were few other options and did not want to park in a surface lot.< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

<time>1511071341220<//time><review>Good location. The room is spacious and clean. Now the not-so-good part: at check-in, the staff told me the room I booked was not ready. She said she gave us a free upgrade to a room that's available right away. I checked later on that I was charged 125 CAD extra for the "free" upgrade - not cool. The second day, ordered room service. The menu is already very overpriced, even for a hotel. The weather wasn't great and the kids were fussing so I had to order it. The bill came to 50 USD for a chowder + sandwich. It turns out in their fine print that they charge 10 USD for delivery and another 22% for "convenience charge" whatever that means. I know I should've read more carefully at the fine print but 10$ +22% is ridiculous. I stayed at Hyatt Regency a day before and they (a 5 star) only charge 5$ for room service with no extra charge.</review><Name>Kevin Jing Qiu< /Name>< rate>

<Text>Please stop tricking people from booking your hotel by not placing a notice on your website that it's under renovation. I booked 2 separate night stays and wasn't able to cancel the second night.

Le Meridien, you're better than that.

I enjoyed another stay in SF at Le Meridien. Room was clean and comfortable and I once again enjoyed the Lobby Bar and restaurant. I travel by myself and I enjoy the sprots TV and the relaxed atmosphere.<//Text>

<text>Attended an event at LM in the 3rd floor restaurant space. The space was well laid out with clean modern decor - grey, black and purple color theme. We jad drinks in tje bar space and then moved to the finning room for a sit down dinner and presentation. Service was awesome. Appetizer choice was difficult to eat, a phyllo bundle that left crumbs everywhere. Dinner was very tasty and well presented. The bar and lobby space are very nicely laid out and decorated. The bar was very active when I walked throuh, gave the lobby a lot of energy.<//text></record>

There is no pool and there is no wifi in the gym. Wifi should be in the gym, given that it is underground and there is no way to stream music through your phone while you are working out...very dissapointing.

Also, the balcony door did not open past a couple inches because there was a stopper. Lastly, the air conditioning was broken in my room, and it was uncomfortably hot. Coupled with not being able to open the balcony door, this was dissapointing.

TV could be bigger (upgrade to 42 inches from 32).

Service was great, as was location, but improvements can be made to the above.< /Review>

Traveled and stayed at this hotel with a number of work peers for meetings. Hotel was overpriced and even though we all booked the same way, charges were very much different. Others received lower room rates as well as free parking a savings of close to $100.00 a day. I would ask hotel management how would you explain these differences to your Internal Audit team if you were in my position?</review>

We were never given advance warning that facilities remodel work was underway. Hotel entry and exit was through a service elevator in the bowels of the building...NOT pretty or convenient! One of our two days was spent without hot water from 10AM to 3PM. We were thoroughly disappointed.<//review>

The walls between rooms must be thin, because my mother and I could hear our neighbors talking very early in the morning, often waking her up. We also invested in some ear plugs to sleep with because of the loud traffic at all hours. We were on the 10th floor and could hear traffic, honking, pedestrians yelling, etc. through the night. If you can handle some noise, it's worth it!< /review>< pics>

The actual room and location are fine -but protests begin at 5:30am and last until about 7:30am. I looked online and apparently this has been happening for years. Its very disruptive and almost impossible to miss. Will not stay here again.< /review>

<date>1392422400000< /date><Rating>None<//Rating><text>I booked a last minute Valentines Day get-away. I was contacted a few days before to confirm that my suite night upgrade request was granted. At that time I spoke with a manager (Zac) and I asked about getting a reservation for dinner on Valentine's Day. He pulled some strings and worked some magic as he was able to secure a table for my wife and I at a great local restaurant. We had a great evening. The following morning, there was some type of protest in the area. While I was checking out, the desk staff was very apologetic for the inconvenience, although it was in no way the fault of the hotel staff.
My wife and I will certainly be back at Le Meridien again.< /text>< Pictures>

<Text>The "never stop:" music experience was awful, like a torture and spoiled the otherwise nice atmosephere of the hotel. An impromptu survey of others waiting in the lobby or, espcially at breakfast, all found that it intrusive to the point that concentrating on work, newspapers, or even conversation was hard.
Also was perturbed to find that opting for the ecology friendly linen plan meant denying wages to hard working low paid cleaning staff. Not a happy choice.</Text>< Pictures>

The Meridian is a wonderful, friendly, professional hotel. The location is ideal for tourists as it is close to the Ferry Building and the Embarcadero with its shops and restaurants. The staff and the concierge were helpful in making reservations and giving directions.</review>

Once I was able to establish the rate for this portion of our stay at Le Meridien, I was generally pleased by the location and amenities. However, I continued to be dismayed by the inadequacy of the so-called business center. Of three computers, two had their keyboards locked, rendering them useless, and the third had a keyboard that skipped, making it very difficult to log in. I reported this to the staff, who explained that the computers were maintained under a contract and that repairs took some time.</review>

We didn't mind that the hotel was under construction/renovation, although it would have been nice to know that beforehand via the website or an email. It's unacceptable to not provide a coffeemaker of some sort in the room, and then offer horrible-tasting (weak) coffee at the front desk. Do you really want the majority of your guest slogging down in various states of dress and hangover, etc. to your public areas for a tiny cup of coffee? Also, the hotel accidentally charged us a nightly rate even though we booked on points. They cleared it up immediately and credited our card, but we left with the feeling that this happens quite a lot. We hope the hotel improves after its upgrade, but wouldn't recommend it at all presently.</review>

After a six hour flight, all you want is something to eat and a comfortable room to catch up your work before needing a good nights rest. This hotel offers everything to make you comfortable.</Review>

I stayed at Le Meridien for a wedding with a negotiated rate for the wedding party. The hotel / Starwood made a mess of reservations for me and my daughter resulting in a 25 minute delay when I checked in and a similar delay the next day for my daughter at check in while the front desk sorted it out.  Then, when I asked housekeeping to switch out the heavy down comforter for a blanket, they put a sad looking blanket on the bed but no top sheet. When I phoned to ask for a top sheet, housekeeping initially didn't want to give me one.  I repeated my request and five minutes later, a staff member knocked on the door and handed me a sheet!  Guess guests make their own beds here.< /text>

Was there for a Jeopardy audition. Hotel staff was very friendly and helpful. Meeting rooms were freezing and there was a lack of chairs in the waiting area.< /Text>

My family and I were originally booked in a business suite. When I called down to order a cot for my son the staff moved us to a studio in order to fit a cot. We left for most of the day touring the city at which time the staff was going to move our luggage to the new room. When we returned our luggage was lost and no cot in room. It took approximately two hours to retrieve our luggage. When I called to inquire about the cot they said they were sold out and no cots were available. No problem I understand human error. I requested a blanket for my son to sleep on the couch. I was told no blankets were available. Ummm did I miss something? You are a hotel right? I don't go to Starbucks and they tell me they're out of coffee. Sadly my son had to cover up with towels which is absolutely UNACCEPTABLE. At check out I brought the issue up and was compensated with 2,000 starpoints and an order of chicken fingers was comped. REALLY, that's hardly a way to treat your most loyal customers. I will never return to this property and am out raged with such poor treatment.</Text>

<response>None<//response><text>I had traveled all the way from India and East Coast for a company meeting at this property last week. I had an early check-in (helpful staff) and went up to 20th floor to realize that the room was not cleaned after the previous guest check-out. Needless to say it wasnt a pretty sight.
Went for a walk, returned and realized that the keys would'nt work. I accumulated about 6-8 keys against my name in 2 days with all the key trouble.
Woke up at 3 am due to jet lag and found that the room didnt have a coffee maker! There is no spot (lobby or otherwise) housing a pot of coffee...!!</text><Date>1435190400000<//Date>< rating>

I was at Le Meridien for a bachelorette party. The rooms were beautifully decorated and clean. The beds were comfortable and the view from the room we stayed in was spectacular. I would definitely recommend Le Meridien.</Text>

<review>Stayed here in late 2015. The check-in seemed a little clumsy but may have been due to the holidays - long lines, just a few people at the counter to handle.

The hotel is modern and well-kept and we were treated to a nice view of San Francisco with a balcony and living room. Don't forget about the little perks that Le Meridien provides - a free coffee voucher at their coffee bar and free admission to museums in the area. Would definitely stay here again, especially for the modern design and style of the Le Meridien theme.< /review></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
The very worst experience at a Starwood hotel! The guest service staff are very rude and do not follow through with their promise. As a platinum member I asked three times over a two day period to book well in advance of the 72 hr guarantee and could not get anyone to call me back. The staff and the manager on duty were very rude and would not consider my request. Brand loyalty is meaningless to La Meridian. Service and attitude has been questionable in the past but this is the worst! I will inform my staff and corporation of the poor service and not to book with this hotel..</Review>

I had to cancel my stay here about 2 weeks prior.  I asked for a refund, they didn't even bother to say no, they just didn't respond.  2 months later the booking agency just gave me a partial to retain me as a customer.  The "on duty" manager does not return phone calls.< /review>

I would not stay here until the construction is completed, very irritating jackhammering within the hotel itself. Also even if the hotel is completed, there is extensive noisy construction in the neighborhood that went on all night long. The hotel's location would be outstanding if not for the extensive neighboring construction.</text>

I love staying at this hotel, however was extremely unhappy with this stay because I had to wait for over an hour for a room. The employee kept giving me an excuse that he was trying to find me an amazing room with a great view and that was why it was taking so long. They had overbooked my suite and then had me stay in a smaller suite instead of upgrading me. Needless to say, I was disappointed with the staff and the way we were treated.</Review>

After numerous flight delays because of weather, I arrived at this hotel at 3 am, dead tired, having now been up for about 24 hours. When I went to my room, I opened the door and found the lights on and wet towels on the floor. I immediately thought that someone must be in the room. I went back downstairs and reported this and was told that housekeeping sometimes forgets to pick up the towels (really???). One of the staff members then went upstairs to check it out. He came back in a few minutes and had a long whispered conversation with the night clerk. I was then told that this room wasn't available and there were no more rooms. (My reservation was made as part of a group booking, so I assume it should have been a safe reservation.)

You can imagine how I felt hearing that there was no room at the inn. However, the night manager spent some time looking through the computer and came up with another room. I was escorted upstairs by a hotel staff member, and when I asked about a room key, I was told that it would be slipped under the door later that night. Very strange.

I was attending a two-day meeting hosted by a local company, who told all of us that they left gift bags at the hotel for each of us. Since there was no gift bag, I later asked at the front desk about this and was told that they would check. I never heard anything, so later I asked again. I then received a message that the host company did not leave enough gift bags, a fact that they deny. Where did it go? Was it taken by the person who took my reserved room?

Did the hotel give away my room to someone else? Did the hotel charge both me and this other person for the same room?

After spending all day at a meeting, I came back to my room to find some cheese, fruit and crackers, a bottle of wine and a note of apology for the misunderstanding on check-in. While I recognize this as a decent gesture, the food was dried out from sitting there all day, and I wasn't going to have a chance to drink the wine.

More appropriate, in my mind, was to make some kind of financial adjustment to my bill. However, because I was seldom in the room and had to leave on an early flight, I never really had time to discuss this.

The whole experience seemed wholly inappropriate for a hotel which portends to be a first-class property.<//text>

<review>I arrived late in the evening after a coast to coast flight and have an important early morning meeting so I went to take a shower directly without checking the room. The bathroom was a little bit weird already with paint smell and yellow water from the tap (after letting it run for a minute the water returned normal color). After the shower, I noticed the same paint smell in the whole room and then found a paper on the bathroom door - which turned out to be a re-decorating checklist from the construction worker and only half of the list was checked. I was shocked that the staff would assign such a room to a guest - I wouldn't expect this even in a motel room. I called the front desk and they were extremely reluctant and slow in assigning me a new room and didn't apologize at all, only saying "it happens". I got my new room after midnight and this is really the worst experience I had with any hotel.< /review>< user>

Classy hotel in the heart of the Financial District.  Got a nice deal on TravelZoo for $189 that included parking (which is normally an additional $65!).  Right next to Embarcadero Center, and a pretty short walk to the Ferry Building and Exploratorium.  Staff very friendly and attentive, although restaurant kind of screwed up our order.  Still, the hotel comped the meal, which is a sure sign that customer satisfaction is of extreme importance to them.  We'll stay again!<//Text>

Pros: modern design, close to tourist attractions, fantastic views from the room, clean/well kept rooms, helpful staff, there's a Safeway within walking distance if you need groceries.

Cons: valet is $60/day, noisy at times from all the street traffic, no free wifi

Tip: you can park in the parking garage across the street for $33/day. There's a breakfast spot within a 5min walk that has awesome breakfast sandwiches called Cafe Me.

Me and my family enjoyed our stay at this hotel during a 5-day vacation in San Francisco. We look forward to coming back soon!<//Text>

While the staff is excellent, the two beds in our room were so worn out and they sunk so deeply in the center that it was difficult to get out of bed. The fabric covered furniture was worn. I understand that the hotel is being remodeled. I hope they replace the beds.< /text>

The room has been lovely, but the bathroom hasn't been cleaned very well, which makes me worry about the rest of the cleaning. The fire alarm also went off accidentally at 6:40 Sunday morning, which isn't fun.</text>

I called to complain and housekeeping came up and changed the bedskirts. The smell remained so the next day they cleaned the carpet, but it was still there. They did try each time to fix the situation so I did feel like they were very helpful. If I had not stayed here before and had such wonderful experiences in the past, my review might not have been as favorable, but they really did try to help.

I understand that the lobby is under construction but the need to take a side elevator to the faux lobby is a terrible idea. I was frustrated and annoyed during my stay because it added more time to leave/enter the hotel. Also, I received zero recognition from the staff about being an SPG member upon checking in. The rooms are nice.< /Text>

<Review>I paid nearly $400.00 per night for a supposed "luxury" room, and was instead stuck next to the elevators and what sounded like a drunken frat party. The hotel staff did nothing to quiet the neighboring guests; when the staff consented to relocate me during the middle of the night (rather than disturb the no doubt higher-paying beer party), the room I was moved to was tiny, on the 9th floor, and certainly unworthy of the $400/night rate.

Also, the hotel did not warn me when I made the reservation that the hotel was under construction at the time of my visit. I would have wanted to know that.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

Hard to get a good night sleep when I was woken up at 6:15 or so with folks yelling outside my window. Would have been nice to know that when I checked in and agreed to be on a lower floor directly above the entrance. This was very disappointing.<//review>

< Review>
This was a shocking experience. I am a Starwoods reward member for 13 years and have stayed in SPG hotels all over the world.
We arrived mid morning and were able to check in earlier, great. We checking into the room and the small sliding glass door had cigarette butts thrown all around the small opening crack. I brought this to the attention of the house cleaner who said she would clean it up, but seriously, how is that not taken care of immediately.
When we returned to the room mid afternoon, our heads were rattling form the jack hammer construction a floor or 2 above. I called immediately front desk and was told I would have room changed. I asked to have the duty manager come up to the room to experience this terrible noise. The manager that came up to the room was also shown the filth all over the hallway carpeting from construction on a room 3 doors down. She said it was not her responsibility but would make sure this was brought to the attention of the proper manager. When I asked how a guest could make a reservation and be checked in and not told about possible renovation problems, she said she was sorry.
We were moved up to the 18th floor, which was away from the noise and a newly renovated room, which we appreciated. But this is no way to communicate with guests.

<text>When we booked didnt mention about the renovation at the front lobby. The noise was disturbing and they didnt change our room because of the noise. We had to use one elevator to go to the 2nd floor for the lobby that was always crowded (we had to use elevator because of our 4 month old baby). The room next to us was too noisy and would wake us up or keep us awake.
When we called the bell man we waited on the phone for over 20 minutes.
Also the quality of the bed was under our expectation being too soft, deepening in the middle.<//text>< Time>

The hotel staff was arrogant and provided poor customer service. They gave us the room key cards like 10 times and none of them worked at first attempt. Overall had a really ordinary experience, there was nothing special even on Christmas weekend in this hotel and would never recommend any of my friends to stay here.</Text>

<name>Buzz3750<//name><Review>The Hotel is undergoing renovation in the lobby, which required the guests to use a service elevator from the street to the 2nd floor lobby. That was a minor issue.

However, my room was drafty as the sliding glass doors did not close completely. This should have been fixed. While I like fresh air (in general), this made from some cold evenings.

Finally, a major complaint is that a SPG who is paying $300+ for a room still has to pay for WIFI. WIFI should be free, and while this is not restricted to Starwood, it is a minor issue that causes a major resentment.< /Review><resp>None</resp></record></dataset><record>

It all comes down to the experience and my last moments here tainted the entire stay. All along the staff was very accommodating, friendly and met my every need. I had even forgotten an iPhone charger and as they had several on hand, let me borrow it for the duration of my stay . Since I had to return it I decided to check out at the front desk and get a final folio from there. He was on the phone when I arrived so I waited patiently for him to be done. When I handed the iPhone charger and thanked them for letting me use it he said (with an attitude) "Oh, so that is where it has been." Then when I asked to check out he asked me if I got a copy of the folio in my room. I said yes, and before I could finish he said that is all you need. I said no, my company prefers a final bill not an estimated bill of final charges. He was starting to get on my nerves and seemed to refuse my request twice. It was 5AM and it was not like the place was busy and he had a lot to handle at the time. He finally complied with my request and did not thank me for staying. That last interaction is one that would make me reluctant to stay there again, but it is our company's preferred hotel as it is next door to the office. So I will be back in the future.< /review>

When checking out no balance was on our account, next credit card statement indicated that +$50 was owed for internet (not used) and food (questionable amount).

Room was very nice, comfortable in a great location.  BUT please check your statement!!!!!< /text>

<text>The hotel is currently under construction, so the lobby and bar were closed. In the room, it was clean an nice, but the TV did not work, no bath soap, no in room coffee.

We stay at this hotel quite often and love the location and the rooms. Breakfast is great, the other meals I feel are a bit mediocre. One complaint on our last room, please clean out the cover in the shower over the flourescent light that is full of bugs and flies, makes it feel like the room is unclean.< /Text>

Close to Chinatown, North Beach, Ferry Building and Union Square (and the Embarcadero Bart station). Comfortable and clean, friendly staff. Killer bay views from the 21st floor. WIll be back next time we visit the foggy city.< /text>

<review>I was a bit worried by previous reviews but there was no need. We had excellent service with both early and late departures. The room was clean and a good size. We did not really realise how close we were to things until the last day. It can get a little noisey being in the city but not too bad.< /review><pictures>None</pictures><Date>1336853288422</Date>< GmapID>

The view from the room was beautiful. The room was comfortable and clean. However, arrived at 4:00pm and room was not ready yet. Told they would call when ready. Went out to walk around and kill time. Finally at 5:30 decided to head back to the hotel. (still no call) Went to front desck to see if room was ready. Was told that yes it was. I mentioned that I had been waiting for a call and the front desk personnel laughed and said, "I just got here so not up to me to call." Then appologized (sort of) and gave me the keys. The thing is, she was there at 4:00 when I had checked in. She could have cared less that we were waiting and inconvenienced. Once in the room, no towels or wash cloths. Towels were finally delivered, but never the cloths. Valet service not good upon arrival, but was at check out. Room, price, location all good, but service is Horrible!!</text>

This was our last leg of our 25th wedding anniversary vacation. Although we only stayed one night, everything and everyone associated with the hotel could not have been better. The next time we have an opportunity to visit San Francisco we will definiatly try to include this hotel.< /Review>

<Text>For a hotel of this quality, it makes no sense to charge separately for so many items. After quoting a fair price for the room, at every turn we were charged for separate items. This not only made it difficult to estimate the true cost of our stay,it was offensive.< /Text>< Rating>

I was surprised for the price of the room that there was no coffee pot and that the towels had no thread left. I feel that when paying over 300 dollars a night these basics should be better quality..< /review>

<Text>Nice hotel in a great location, but I found the staff at the front desk to be pretty unfriendly. Other staff I dealt with were much friendlier and helpful, perhaps they should be the ones at front desk.<//Text>< pics>

This 4-star hotel has decent amenities and the suites are absolutely geogous. If you pay for the upper-tier room, you absolutely get what you pay for. Our WiFi and breakfast were complimentary thanks to our gold status, but there really aren't additional perks with platinum members here. Location is excellently located near parts of the warf and tons of other entertainment within a 1 mile radius. Please note that this hotel does not have a Starwood Preferred lounge anywhere on site.< /Review>

<Text>Booked and paid for a king size bed room and received a double bed room by the elevator.

You can figure out how displeased I was with my stay.

Nice facility, well located in the Fab City-by-the-Bay, but poorly run!</Text>< pictures>

Strongly encourage anyone to wait until the remodel is done. The lobby is closed and the temporary "front desk" is hidden on the second floor after taking the freight elevator from the ground level.< /Text>

Nice location and good staff but I was shocked to find that the shower door was broken (completely missing) and a shower rod and curtain was the "best" fix that could be done. The mattress (as most all do in hotels) listed to the telephone side of the bed.<//Review>

I originally booked a hotel at the Hyatt Fisherman's Wharf for a few days, but the first night was overbooked. As a result, we were sent to Le Meridian free of charge. The Le Meridian was supposed to direct bill to the Hyatt, but they did not. It was only till I returned to Los Angeles that I discovered not just one charge, but two charges to my account.

The first charge was supposed to be direct billed to the Hyatt. After several calls and speaking to multiple people, the charge was supposed to be resolved. I later check my card, and I was charged again! Two charges! The front desk manager stated she accidentally charged me again and voided it immediately, which fell off after a few days. 

The second charge that went through was due to mistaken identity. They charged me due to another guest having the same name. How is it possible that they got the room number and/or credit card number wrong and just went off my name? 

All in all, I've been promised several refunds and have yet to see anything. It's been a nightmare calling every day to sort out some new mistake from the Le Meridian. I definitely would not stay here, even if it was free again.</Text>

<text>We notified the hotel staff in person and over the phone about the following. We were able to move from the 7th floor to the 10th floor, however, we can still hear the noises from #3 and #4 listed below. Staff said they contacted the police but the police never arrived. The staff indicated that the protestors have been doing this for 20 years. The staff had contradicted their own comments because they said the protestors are protesting under legal restrictions and will most likely protest again tomorrow. The staff told us to call the cops on our own.
1) Our room on the 7th floor had mold on the windows 2) windows and walls are not sound proof 3) We could hear cars passing through construction metal plates at the street corner of Clay and Battery 4) we can hear protesters at the same street corner of Clay and Battery where the hotel is located.

We are still here for our last day since our rooms were already payed for so we'll see how it all turns out. I might give a higher rating or might drop it to a lower one. I will update in a few hours.< /text>< Pictures>

<Review>As I write this, I am still in shock as to what just transpired. I am staying for 3 days/2 nights and signed up for green choice. My husband and I arrived yesterday to 2 bottles of water, which we consumed. So at the end of a long day today we realized we were out of water so I dialed zero and asked for 4 bottles since we drink quite a bit of water. To my surprise, I was told that they can only send me 2 bottles because I was only entitled to just that number per day to which I replied that we wanted 4 bottles. Having NEVER had any issues at any Starwood around the WORLD, and as a LONGSTANDING PLATINUM guest, I thought nothing of it. I was again told that only 2 bottles could be sent. When I questioned it I was then told I'd have to pay for the other 2 bottles. I asked him to identify himself which he promptly did. Imagine how puzzled and confused I was in light of the fact that we' d be there the following day until 4:00 pm ( mind you it was already 11:00 pm). So I told this individual that it made no sense that I would not pay for 2 more bottles when I was a platinum guest and would be there through the following day. I also added that no matter what and whether they ended up charging or not we wanted 4 bottles of water. So he then reluctantly said that he would send them up to our room. He sounded exasperated with my insistence to get 4 bottles and he abruptly hung up. 2 mns later a knock on the door and 2 bottles are delivered. So I asked the delivery guy about the other two then he said " they only gave me 2" and said " Sorry you can only get two"!!! I must admit that I thought I was in the twilight zone and questioned him again about the missing 2 bottles. To which he said (as he was walking away) "no, no, I'm sorry you can only have 2. You're going to have to call for the other 2".....
I could not understand that these guys decided to ration my water request even if charging them to my room was ultimately their option. 
They then called and the purported night "manager", a woman who shall remain nameless and frankly deserves no mention, spoke to my husband and I could hear her telling him rather loudly, and combatively that he could not have another 2 bottles. She sounded upset that we challenged the delivery guy and reiterated arrogantly that 2 bottles were all we were getting. My husband reiterated our request and she then rather annoyingly and sternly stated that they would be sent but "you're going to have to pay for it". 
I totally lost my cool and headed downstairs in my PJs to question why I did not get what I asked for whether or not they planned to charge me and why this seemingly incompetent neophyte was pushing back on 2 bottles of water in a way that truly bordered disrespect or at least a lack of awareness. I was triggered and freely let it be known. I was loud, upset and made it clear I was incensed and did not care to entertain the lip service. As a paying customer I asked for 4 bottles and my expectations were that they sent me 4 bottles. The charges I would deal with on the back end. The night manager (the rudest and most CLUELESS, IRREVERENT, ARROGANT, and ALOOF woman I have met in a while) and a few unidentified guys all surreptitiously showed up as if they were all dispatched to save the day and perhaps display a show of force or unity in ineptitude. I make no bones about the fact that I was loud and equally irreverent at that stage. I reiterated my position, albeit rather loudly and sternly, that all I wanted were 4 bottles of water, that it was none of their business to question me especially after expressing their desire to charge me. 
So I asked that clueless woman manager to help me understand the logic of charging me when I had not had my 2 bottles today and in one hour (at midnight) I would theoretically be due another 2 bottles. So she said "well if that's what you want to do then do that". I then let her know that made no sense to entertain that option when she was refusing any logic associated with just letting me have 2 extra bottles practically 40 mns before to which she retorted "so does this make any sense to you?" with a defiant and tone-deaf manner that just truly irritated me. So I asked again " what happens if I don't ask for 2 bottles tomorrow? Do I then get a credit for the charges?" She then said "no, you'll get charged for 2 bottles and that's that. There won't be a credit". I then told her that her boss would hear from me about this mess and she slyly said "I already emailed him"...
I can't begin to express the swell of frustration and disbelief that overcame me for standing in the lobby after 11:00 pm arguing about 2 bottles of water that I was asking to get to my room. 2 bottles of water because we wanted to remain hydrated through the night!!!!! Just unbelievable!.......What was it to them and why this arrogance? While holding her defiant stare I firmly told her that I wanted my additional 2 bottles and promptly dismissed any additional retort from her. She just said " fine I'll send you the water and charge you". As I walked away I could hear them laughing and commenting about the incident. 
We waited about 15 mns and no deliveries came. My husband followed me down in the lobby got the succeeding Supervisor, a gentleman who swiftly said he would send the 2 bottles without skipping a beat and even thinking twice about it. 
In the meantime the outgoing crew led by this woman manager tried to be slick and sent up 2 glass bottles of water as opposed to the (plastic) Nestle ones that are stocked in the room. They charged us $14.00+ for those glass bottles. Unfortunately for her the delivery that the gentleman evening Manager promised came up right after Ashe had promised. We simply returned the glass bottles for refund and kept the 2 Nestle bottles. I have a feeling that the woman who befuddly carries the manager title, did not realize that her successor followed through as intended and as was originally expected. His easy going nature and quick agreement to accommodate was a stark contrast and exactly what one would expect. Kudos to him for doing what was right!!!! 
Never have I experienced such ineptitude and lack of connection to purpose on the account of a supposed management team. I would not have that woman manager as a trainee at a neighborhood store or a fruit concession stand let alone a prestigious Starwood hotel in San Francisco. She is not deserving of that title and completely missed the point. I am a LOYAL customer and I simply asked for 4 bottles of water. Your job is to send them to me and decide on what your policy states. If it is charging then do that and let me then deal with it on the back end. It is not for you to challenge my request and display your sarcasm and ignorance at me. It does not bode well for you or your property as I am completely rigid about customer service that is tactful, courteous, and adaptable. I pushed right back and I am sure it was unexpected. It goes without saying that I have no desire to go back there during my next visit in a few weeks. I am sure they have their filter about my intervention but I will not apologize for standing up for what I have come to know as the staple STELLAR, unequivocal, unquestionable service from Starwood. 
So with the power of "the pen" I am warning others that you need to be cognizant of the fact that your voice as a customer may not carry far at that hotel with this woman's stiff view of her beloved and golden policies. Your voice will not matter to her and some others at this property. Through her cluelessness Le Meridien San Francisco missed the mark and I will surely take my money and loyalty elsewhere....in the end the correct thing prevailed. The succeeding Manager's prompt recovery allowed us to have the extra bottles and, just like I promised this lady it would happen, I paid nothing (zilch) for the water. This is truly a stinging case of the customer is always right but unfortunately I will never again set foot at that place!!!!.... The liberating power of bountiful choices in sister properties all around frankly renders this manager-in-training and this facility irrelevant in my eyes...<//Review>< Pictures>

This is as much a complaint about Starwood as it is Le Meridien. I called twice, weeks in advance of our trip, to inquire about the airport shuttle offered on their website. The original call was to Starwood and then I decided to make a separate call straight to the front desk just to be sure. On both calls I was told that all I needed to do was to call the number provided on the website any time after finishing at baggage claim at SFO and a shuttle would be sent. However, when I called the number at 1:00am from SFO, it reported that the number was no longer in service. So I called the front desk from the baggage claim. NOW they tell me that the hotel does not have a shuttle service. I'm supposed to reserve a shuttle with one of the two companies they suggest. Then they give me a web page address for one of the shuttle companies. The web page is for making reservations, NOT for being picked up immediately. So I call the Starwoods number and they look it up and then attempt to provide me the same number from the web page that is "no longer in service". Long story short, it eventually gets sorted out that the number on the website is only open during business hours (but it still a 3rd party service). In the end I had to talk one of the shuttle drivers at the airport into giving me and the wife a ride to the hotel at 1:45am without a reservation with no help from Starwood or the hotel desk.

Also, I was told when I was making the reservation that if I joined up to become a Starwood Preferred" member (for free) that the internet fees at the hotel would be waived. I asked the front desk for the access code and they tell me that only PLATINUM members could receive the waived internet fees. So I'm back on the phone with Starwood at 2:30am asking them what the deal is. Turns out that I made the mistake of actually calling and talking to a live person at Starwood when making my reservation. The internet fees are only waived if reservations had been done online and since I've already checked into the hotel there's "nothing they can do". So I'm paying $45 just to be able to write this review when I was told my internet access would be free.

Finally, the hotel itself is a lot smaller overall than expected based on the pictures provided online. The hallway has a funky smell to it (thankfully the room does not). The walls are pretty thin though. We're on the 5th floor and can hear the street sweepers going by loud enough that it woke my wife up to ask what the noise was.

All in all, I'll do my best to avoid any and all Starwood properties in the future after this first experience with them.<//text>

<review>This place used to be my favorite. It's unacceptable to not inform guests ahead of time off the massive construction. Very unacceptable to notify a guest the night before that the hot water would be shut off. It shouldn't be s suprise to a guest and should have been informed ahead of time especially at checkin.</review><gmap_id>0x8085806033e06771:0x5585cb03086b5f0f<//gmap_id>< Rate>

<review>Hello,

I know your staff was trying to give me a larger room, possibly due to my status (?), but in the future, please do not put me in a handicap room, unless it's the last room in your hotel. There are no counters in the bathroom. I ended up putting my makeup bag and bathroom kit on the shower bench. Thank you.

<review>I arrived late, around 23:30 and they had overbooked. They did arrange for a cab to the Omni hotel but still it was a annoyance.</review><user_id>115865098989456412454< /user_id><date>1500659816083< /date></record>

First time I have ever written negative review. Checked in after 10 hours of travel. No hint of friendliness from front desk or concierge. No welcome, no smile at all. Worst welcome I have ever received at a Starwood Hotel. NOT COOL!< /text>

For the cost, our stay was unsatisfactory. Apparently the hotel has had Union protests out front for a number of months, but this was not brought to our attention until the protests started at 7 AM. The facility is nice, but our experience was much less than we had hoped for.<//Text>

I regularly attend business meetings in the second floor conference rooms. The space is nice, not luxe like Vitale, but not a Marriott either (eg, they have metal conference tables and cool glass pendant lighting). The catered food is just so-so, it's edible, but a tad overcooked, as hotel catered food is wont to be. Staff are pleasant and the internet always seems to work, so that's a bonus.<//Review>

< Review>
Was VERY disappointed when we showed up and found out the entire lobby was closed for remodeling. We meet friends in SF every year and like to try different hotels just to experience the holiday season and hang out and visit in the lobby. (especially in the Financial District where not much is open on weekends) I understand work needs to be done but for this not to be mentioned when we made our reservation with SPG directly was disappointing. We are SVO and frankly expect more.< /Review>

Generally nice atmosphere and good food, but low ceilings in meeting area makes for a crowded and cramped feeling.</Review>

I stay at this hotel 1/mo and between the construction in lobby and no water pressure, something banging constantly from the room next to me like a washing machine against the wall and the lack of management to do anything about it because they didn't want to disturb other customers- makes me really rethink about staying here. Very disappointed.</Review>

From a confusing temporary lobby layout to a hole in the bedding, this hotel is an overpriced two-star lodge. The place tries to convey style, but it is not even skin deep. The toilet in the bathroom of the room we occupied was loud, but failed to properly flush. The sink would not properly drain. The tub is so slippery that I am surprised any decent facility would take this risk of a guest slipping and falling while taking a shower. Getting a wake-up call an hour earlier than requested is not a sign of good service. Oh, and hearing a rude "at least 10 minutes" after a two unaswered calls to valet parking is not what you would expect for an almost $60 a day parking fee.</Review>

< Review>
What's in a name?

This review is my opinion of Le Meridien San Francisco, based on our stay there.  Having stayed at Le Meridien in Budapest earlier this year, we expected a similar experience here in San Francisco, but we were disappointed. The front-end staff, including the valet, are less professional, evidenced by both their  demeanor and appearance. They appear to be trained to a lower standard than their European counterparts.

We attempted to check in slightly after 3pm, the advertised check-in time, but neither of our two rooms were ready.  Consequently, one room was "upgraded" to include a view and I was asked to leave my mobile number so that the staff could call me when the other room was ready, which was to be by 3:30pm. Of course, the call never came so I ended up having to go back to the front desk and wait in line to see the clerk to inquire about the other room, which by that time was ready. I was told that the reason I was not called was because "things got busy."

The rooms are okay, though the walls let sound through so you can actually make out entire conversations your neighbors are having.  Some street noise makes its way in, even up to the 17th floor, but only the sirens are annoying. The Nakamichi CD player is a nice touch (it has an auxiliary input so you can plug in your player with a 1/4" plug). No refills on the small soap bars, shampoo, or plastic cups were provided throughout our stay, so bring your own. Our room had the banner that hangs on and describes the complimentary bottle of water, but no bottled water was ever present.

Had it not been for the fact that we were celebrating the recent marriage of my sister (one half of the other couple that was traveling with us), we would have checked into another place, where we feel more value could have been gotten for our hard-earned money.

Valet parking was a little over $60 a night. That seemed high to its. The valet directed us to park around the corner at a public parking, where we paid $32 a night.

Update: Although we never did get soap or plastic cup refills, we did finally get a complimentary water bottle in the room, on the third day. We stayed a total of four nights.</Review>

Expensive.
No wi-fi.
No coffee at the room.
No water but in the minibar.
Is not worth the money you pay.<//Text>

Walked in to check out hotel for a friend. He booked online and wondered if it was in a good neighbourhood, nice inside, etc. Although I didn't see a room, the hotel itself and lobby are both well maintained and seem upscale. Decent neighbourhood in close proximity to restaurants, coffee, and tourist destinations<//Review>

<review>Disappointed! Main dining room closed for half of
our stay. Had to call for washcloths twice, toilet paper once. Had a bar waitress that did not want to do separate checks for a party of six.
iigniting was poor in the room and at the buffet.

All concierges were terrofic, somewhat saving the day..< /review>< gmap_id>

<Text>This was a ripoff. The room was small, the view was poor, the towels were thin, the bathroom floor looked like someone had taken sandpaper to it, the shower head wasn't attached properly and sprayed water in all sorts of directions. I was not impressed.< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< date>

Staff was responsive, but did not fix the entire issue. Fixed the faucet that had horrible water pressure, but not the shower which I told and demonstrated was also a problem. Long and short...3 days with only a drip for a shower.</text>
