<Review>The products work really well. The results are immediate. I think that’s the difference between this product and over the counter products. After one day of use, I literally look five years younger.<//Review>< GmapID>

I had used this product before I bought it a few times in Europe.  I bought it again at arden mall and it was a very bad experience the saleswoman a young woman who says she is from Egypt sold me a totally different product from the one I was looking for.  The quality of the product I think has changed over the years because the product that I bought is a product that really burns my face. I do not sincerely recommend using more gold gold products.< /review>

I love this place so much it makes my face glow to the gods I get compliments every single day this place just give me amazing skin and I can just shower in every single thing that they own. My husband has even told me that I look even more beautiful after I use this product.
Even my husband uses it. I never felt more beautiful so confident in my entire life. LOVE THIS STUFF<//text>

The people that work here are super friendly! Some are also bilingual for anyone who doesn’t speak English. I went in to the store and they had great costumer service! I’m Hispanic and I was able to speak to them in my language without a problem. They don’t try to track you down and sell they actually care about the product going to the right costumer! Great place I encourage people to go here!</Text>

Purchased an exfoliating gel and eye cream from here. I’m almost positive that the exfoliating get is glue. It is so hard to get off my face that I have to scrub my face to get it off, which isn’t healthy for my skin. These fast talking sales people are super pushy and I will never go in one of these places again.< /review>

I was pulled into this store by a man with an accent. He asked me what kind of moisturizer I used and before I could answer, he was leading me to one of the vanities he had in his store. It was a matter of seconds before he had me sitting in a chair, explaining his product to me, talking my ear off with flattery and such. He showed me this cleansing gel that would immediately clean my pores as long as I used it once a week. Then, before even asking me if I had any allergies to anything, applied the gel and a cream to my skin. To sell the “magic” of the visit even further, he told me he’d throw in multiple things for free, all I had to do was buy the gel for $178 +tax. He even gave me a card for a free facial, saying he was the manager, and that we just wanted to make me happy. He called me things like “friend” and asked for big hugs. All in all, he was very friendly and made good conversation, but the biggest problem came when it was time to check out. Long story short, my bank declined the purchase because they have the store flagged as a scam in their system. So, when an attractive, foreign man at Orogold offers you a deal that seems too good to be true, don’t waste your time.</Text>

I was stopped by Olivia asking me about my tattoos,  she then got me in there store and used some cream on my hand which I ended up buying.  She supposedly gave me a deal.   As I was about to leave,  that Michael guy stopped me to show me some eye stuff.  He said it was 5.95, and threw in some free stuff. After I paid again, I left,  ended up lookingat the receipt.   Thank God I did because it wasn't 5.95, it was 595.00.  WHAT!!! I quickly returned to return the product.   They tried talking me into a voucher, but after saying no a few times, they gave me a refund.  I won't be going back to that place,  because it's very hard to get out of there, and it's way to expensive.</text>

Sitting outside watching these pushy salesmen pestering women to get them to buy stuff. One guy said to a group of women and I quote, “Are you the Charlie’s angels?”, that must be annoying. Then another guy is asking all the women who walk buy, where did you get your glasses because they look good on you, then saying Hi gorgeous! Where did you get your sunglasses from, can I see? How annoying it must be to be a woman walking by this store in the mall. Geez guys should stop being so pushy.</Review>

I was in the mall and the kind girl suggested some products that would be great for my skin and face. I came in and she gave me a free demonstration of scrub and anti wrinkle cream that would work perfect for me. They were very busy with customers and she gave me her full attention. Never did I feel pressured to buy but the product sold itself, as I instantly saw results. The store was clean and the prices are very fair! I have been using the product for 2 weeks and I can already see a noticeable difference in my skin. Thank you orogold for your hospitality I will always be a customer!!</review>

<review>Similar experience to what others have reported.  I was pulled into the store by Michael.  He was extremely sweet.  He was a touch flirty and charmingly abashed when he heard I was engaged.  He asked me a few questions about my skin care routine and then demo'ed the exfoliating gel.

I had mentioned that my skin is VERY sensitive, and he claimed the product would make my sensitivity go away.  I didn't believe that, but figured it was worth a try to try the product anyway.  It did exfoliate quite nicely, and I was seriously considering making the investment.  However, Michael kept ramping up the aggressiveness of his sales pitch.

I don't make any large purchases without talking to my S.O.  It's not an independence thing, it's a respect thing.  I am terrible with money and my S.O. helps me make responsible choices.  I also ALWAYS wait about 12 hours with new products to make sure I don't have a reaction.  But Michael wouldn't listen when I said I wanted to take some time to think about the purchase--which at that point was a "discounted" bottle of gel for $178 and some "free stuff".  He said he wanted me to be independent and empowered.  Um, okay.

I also don't tend to have large amounts of money in my account--learning responsible spending habits starts with baby steps!  I was at the mall for a specific purpose and had to make sure I had enough to cover those purchases.  When I informed Michael that I didn't actually have enough to cover the cost of the gel--even at his "discounted" price--he asked me, "How much do you have?"

I don't think a salesperson has ever been so rudely, blatantly greedy to me.  I literally ran out of the store.  I will not return, and I recommend that others approach this store warily.</review><Pics>None<//Pics>< user>

<text>I had a great experience here today.

Was shopping with my wife at the mall and walked by here for the first time last week.

We were greeted by funny and positive people who were handing out free bags and what looked like lotion packets.

At first I waited outside while my wife got her face done.
However, my wife convinced me to step into the store.

Orogold gave me some lotion for my hands when I sat down on their comfy chairs.
It smelt good but I don't usually use lotion so I'm not sure how it effected my hands.
The definitely felt soft so I figured they did their job lol.

However the mask they gave me is why I wrote this review:

We bought two masks that were on sale.
When my wife and I came home, we tried them while laying in bed.
It was sooo relaxing.
They were so good we went back this morning and bought more.

We used it today before our pregnancy photo shoot at the capital.
Definitely glad I did because my face was hella dry lol.
A great place stop at in the mall!
5/5 stars.

Awesome store and amazing people in the Arden mall.

Definitely worth the visit!!!!<//text><user_id>105289652649427409333<//user_id></record>

<rating>1<//rating><pics>None<//pics><review>If I could, I would give a negative star. When I was passing the OroGold store at Arden Mall, CA the sales man that stopped me was a manager of the store (according to his name tag). Told me he was the owner of the store and that he 6 other stores, was super pushy and kept on giving me crazy discounts. Basicly for for half the price of one bottle, he gave me 2 bottles. Kept on saying u look like u can use this and ur skin desperately needs that and so on and kept pushing me to buy things... I'm easily convinced, so I bought it and was told that I will b able to return it for full refund if I wasn't completely satisfied. Well I came home, was all excited to try my new super expensive face products that promised me so much... after a few uses, my face started getting swollen and peely. I wasn't able to use anything on my face. The skin became tight and red, I immidiately stopped using the products, called the store and was completely disapointed. I wasn't able to return it at all, they did offer me a discount on my next purchase or to bring my bought products to the store and exchange them for another product. But if I had an allergic reaction, why in the world would I want another product from the same store?? Salesmen are super pushy for u to buy, discussing customer service. Can't wait for the entire company to close down. I am using Origins and Im really satisfied.<//review><time>1431462371719</time>< user_name>

<Review>Park itself is 5*, rather new, large playground for kids of different age, an OK-sized parking lot and large green field for sport activities. There is a number of tables for picnic, as well as some shaded areas with tables (I assume requiring reservation). Public restroom - good (clean, toilet paper, soap and hand dryer). There is not much shade, but lots of space otherwise.

From the downsides - it's located next to some wild areas with rattlesnakes, so parents should pay some attention where the younger kids play. And another thing - the car entrance is accessible from a single southbound road with no u-turns in sight, which is not something to blame the park for, but the city who designed and developed the roads/park entrance. Still, a nice park.<//Review>< Pictures>

We love this park and at the time of this review have elementary-toddler age kids. This park has enough variation of play equipment that all kids are satisfied and challenged. My oldest especially loves scootering on the cement rampways and I love how it's tucked in to natural landscape. A winning park for everyone!</text>

Most importantly the park is open, there is a clear view of the play equipment. Also there is a fairly clear view from one side of the playground to the other which is useful if you have more than one child.</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

Great playground, big and plenty of variety. Only downside is the lack of shade on the play structures.</Review>

Great sports park but bathrooms could use a little cleaning. Also, have heard a lot of cars have been broken into so make sure to hide any valuables or just leave them at home.</text>

Nice park with numerous facilities, in a lovely riparian habitat. Close to San Juan Capistrano and Rancho Mission Viejo,. They also have pickleball courts that can be active at times, although I believe drop-ins are welcome even though the courts belong to the h o a.<//text>

< review>
Man this was good tea! I got the lil giraffe and my sister got the Thai tea. I was unsure of what mine would be like since cake is an ingredient. It’s essentially just cake flavored tea. No weird consistency at all! The cups are bigger than they look so the price isn’t bad either. The straws they used did have a strange taste (they’re a paper variety) so I’d opt for one of their other straw options next time. An older review on Google says they don’t have dairy free options but that isn’t true anymore. Some of the items on the menu do say they can’t be substituted. They have soy, almond, and oat milk though.

I wish I was able to get more aesthetic pictures for the review but with COVID they only allow 1 party in at a time so I wanted to grab the tea and get out. Will definitely be coming back next time I’m in SF.< /review>

Size is a bit small and wish they were more generous with toppings, but the taste and the menu variety is on point! One of my favorite boba in the city right now if I want something with good tea while still having fun with different flavors.<//text>

<review>Cute name. Easy to order. Answered all our questions They filled our drinks to the brim and it was actually spilling out bc of those types of lids they use. You can choose ice level and sweetness and type of milk you want for milk tea. And they also have the loyalty program to collect points.< /review><date>1593989173676< /date>< gmap_id>

<Review>The cups provided are very poorly insulated, so if you get a hot drink to-go, be prepared to wear mittens.  Or you can play hot potato by switching the cup from one hand to the other continuously, have it spill out, and completely scald your hand with first degree burns.  The tea tasted good though.< /Review>< Time>

A welcome addition to the Lower Haight. The space is small, but they make good use of the space with counter seats if you want to stay and chat with friends. The menu on the wall is nicely laid out and I like their white tiling.

The cake batter drinks surprised me and I’m a fan. The owner says you can literally take it and bake it if you add an egg to the batter and mix it up. There’s no egg in the batter for the drinks of course, but you get the idea for the taste. The Camouflage (matcha + golden cake batter) and Lil’ Giraffe (black tea + golden cake batter) were my favorites so far.</Text>

<text>So many milk and topping options! Unique stuff you don't see everywhere and well executed, I've never been disapointed by an order. Good place for a date because everything is so cute, you'll both feel lovely. Or if you're forever alone there are good views and people watching 🙃< /text>< pics>

<text>I love this place and the special tea drinks they offer. My hubby loves their boba (I’m not a fan but my hubby is). The only reason I give them 4 stars instead of 5 is that I’m a Matcha lover and I always in search of great matcha in this area - their Matcha is fine but definitely not the best one I had (and I tried there several different matcha drinks).
Nevertheless I do enjoy their other drinks! Also their service is outstanding! Nice, welcoming and professional staff.<//text><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None</resp><gmap_id>0x808581fdc2e7c50d:0x8eb2043c1506dc92</gmap_id></record>

Loved this place! Tea was very high quality with real taro not powder and creative flavors. A welcoming and bright ambiance with kind staff. The pink panther with crema and taro was amazing. New favorite boba spot.< /Text>

I have been to many boba milk tea places because I love boba so much. I came in because this shop looks super cute! I ordered a strawberry matcha latte with boba, and I liked it. Next time I’ll try their fruit tea with boba, or their cake tea.</text>

<Text>(Translated by Google) I ordered pearl milk tea, slightly sugar (25%), de-icing, the pearls are good, the taste is very good, not sweet pearls. I think milk tea is so-so. Overall it's ok, but not amazing.

(Original)
我點了珍珠奶茶，微糖(25%)、去冰，珍珠不錯，口感很好，不甜的珍珠。奶茶我是覺得一般般。整體來說還可以，但不到驚艷。</Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPmFq7s7eCSnQ6aHod47eLf7ClXBqvR-9BjW2sn=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOvvEWNYhLBwtGFvFswUf8pkLSydQFB8YJv3ir-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOPGl-rqmatDHClRzFxX6CHMlkuGzE8M5Ytq9Sf=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOVXNSxvR3kjkeocPSY6Dh-SfnJMohm_AZN1fYO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOFTX4rcnStFW9wG2uC3JMMG9aHOJ9ftUEGZ8u_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPcLPp8nUGKc1zd2V2f-hd1UEazKOyMtC6NWdNc=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< Gmap_id>

<Review>California Smog & Test is the best smog check station in the area! I've gotten tests at other places where they aren't nearly as nice or quick.

The first time I came to them I was brand new to the state and didn't really understand the process. They explained the system to me and the ins and outs of the law. This is my second time coming and they remembered me from two years ago, I was blown away. The staff is incredibly kind and helpful and really care about their costumers. I highly recommend getting your smog check here. Note-** I needed a star certified check this time around and they do those as well.</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None<//response>< GmapID>

Great experience, the owner was a pleasure and very professional! I came in with a coupon that they offered online so the price was very reasonable and the process was very quick! I recommend this place to anyone required to get a smog check.< /Text>

<text>Best smog check car station.
Albert was super nice. I called to find out where he was located and the price for a smog check. I was in a hurry since my registration was due in 48 hours. He automatically offered me a coupon which is on his website but he made sure to honor it even if couldn’t print it.
The work was fast and professional.
Great attitude as well

Highly recommended<//text><response>None< /response><Date>1578348847490</Date><username>ANJEZA ANGIE GEGA<//username><userid>115400910744741308288<//userid><pics>None<//pics></record>

<user_name>Kim Chang< /user_name><Time>1575843517035<//Time><Rating>5< /Rating><review>I went and had my annual smog check done yesterday. Usually, I get it done in Alhambra on Garfield Ave and Mission RD. I usually pay $30 including the certificate. Went up 4 yrs ago to $35.00. I think the original owner sold his business 2 yrs ago. Probably retired. So I was planning to go the one across from there in Alhambra. But didn't feel like driving out there since I live near Griffith PK. So I found this place on Google. They even have a coupon. So I thought I'll check this place out since is so close to my house. The gentleman's name is Albert. It seems like a good legit place, gets pretty busy. There were 3 cars ahead of me. I waited no more than 10 mins. When it was my turn, OMG!!! Within 4 mins, it was done. Now that's what I call super duper awesome service. Fantastic service and fast. Very courteous and professional. If you pay cash, you save $2.00. Albert is so nice and friendly. I highly recommend this place. Thank you, Albert, for your wonderful service. I will definitely bring my business to him again. 🙏 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ 🚗<//review>< pics>

<Review>I always use Albert for all my smog checks. He is very polite, fast, and reliable. So far, I've taken 10+ cars to him and have referred him to my friends/family. He speaks Armenian and Farsi and is a pleasure. Most tests take 30 minutes or less.<//Review>< Name>

Not sure how this could have been any easier. Fast in and out (literally about 5 minutes - I didn't even get to finish an email I was writing as I waited). Great price (coupon online). Friendly, helpful owner.

By far the best smog check experience I've had since they started in 1984. Furious at my past self for not finding them sooner.</text>

On Saturday Feb 20, 2016 I went to California Smog & Test Only in Glendale. I moved to California and need to get a SMOG for my vehicle. I went online and read tons of reviews about the different stations chosen California Smog & Test Only. I meet Albert. He was everything and more and all the positive reviews are true. Albert is the most kind, gentleman and professional. The old school and that old fashion services that we all wish we had. The service was fast, and he was courtesy. He went over and beyond and made my service a very pleasant one. Also, I need other services done to my vehicle, and he recommend a shop that will help me and provide the same service he gives at his establishment. If you are from out of the state, and need a SMOG test for your vehicle. Please go to California Smog & Test Only and ask for Albert you will not go wrong. I give him an A+++++</text>

Albert was great! I got ripped off at another place but this smog check station had me in and out for a reasonable fee.

Simple, in and out. Definitely suggest this place. Easy to find too, perfect if you're in Glendale!<//text>

The gentleman, Albert who took care of me was extremely professional and very friendly. He handled my smog check and completed it quickly!

I needed a smog check immediately as my vehicle registration renewal is the next day... I got mine done fast because of Albert!

Thank You!< /Review>

This place is always a great experience. I have taken all my cars here, and have come out happy every single time. The technician was very nice and helpful. I was out of there in 10 minutes. Fast and cheap. I have already recommended to all my friends. Couldn't be more happy<//Text>

I came in without an appointment and the wait was still very quick. The coupon I had didn't apply to my car, but the owner gave me a discount anyway. Apparently I also hadn't warmed up my car enough on the way over so he warmed it up for me to re-check. Long story short - great service, great price, fast and convenient.< /review>

<Text>This place is awesome I didn’t need an appointment and when I drove in the guy came straight out of his office and started the smog within 4 minutes of me being there. I was done with in 15 minutes if that. I definitely would recommend this place and the pricing is fair.< /Text><Date>1525884449514< /Date><gmap_id>0x80c2c0e0d455c20d:0x291d5b815b09faa9<//gmap_id>< name>

Great experience with great customer service. Albert is great at what he does and is very accommodating. I've been here twice for my smog checks and each time it has been a great experience until this recent check when my car started giving me trouble. Albert was very helpful in offering suggestions and letting me comeback for a retest. Came back and passed the next time and the process was just as fast. As long as I need a smog check, I'll be coming here.< /Text>

TIP FOR THE LADIES: He is down the street from the Americana and Galleria! So after getting your test, reward yourself and  shopping. That's what I'm doing. TIP FOR ALL CUSTOMERS: Get the Yelp discount on here - $46 for $68 regular price!!< /review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

Wow. I don't usually write reviews, especially for a smog check inspection. I live in the Glendale Burbank area and needed a smog check so I look on yelp and found this smog check station. I went in and was immediately greeted by the gentleman that was going to do the test. I literally gave him my keys, sat down for 5 minutes, read a magazine, and heard the good news that my car had passed the test. I paid a very cheap price and was out of there in less than 10 minutes. Will be back with my other cars<//Review>

I've been going here for 5 years to be exact. All my cars have been serviced here successfully. Before I have a chance to sit, Albert is done with my smog check.All my friends come here, and I guess its the go to place in Glendale/Burbank. And its the cheapest. I don't usually leave reviews, but I had to for this one.<//review>

I needed a smog check fast, not realizing my registration fees were due the next day.  No hassle at all.  I received fast & friendly customer service, even coming in late in the afternoon (after work).  I was in & out in no time.  Albert helped me out.  He is the man to go to.<//review>

Made a bunch of calls to find a well priced smog check in the area. Here, the price is not only good, the service is friendly and helpful. Next check will definitely be here.< /Text>

<review>I will never go anywhere else to get a smog test done. Albert gave me a retest after I failed my first and gave me a friendly suggestion as to what the problem may be. His hunch was right and I was able to fix the problem for way less than what a mechanic or the dealership would have charged. I took the test again and now I'm the smartest kid in school.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None< /Response><GmapID>0x80c2c0e0d455c20d:0x291d5b815b09faa9< /GmapID></record>

< Review>
Albert is nice, professional and fast acting.  He performed smog check deligently, working his way like in a line assembly.  Smog check for my 2009 Toyota Camry was done in reasonably short waiting time.  He is friendly and the price is very reasonable.  I have 3 cars.  Previously brought to him my oldest truck, now my Toyota and when my Maxima is up, will surely bring it to his shop, too.  Thanks, Albert for being in my neighborhood  See you again next time.</Review>

A very friendly owner, in and out in no time. A coupon from their website and an additional discount for writing a Yelp review on the spot brought the total down to $42. You will be hard-pressed to find better or more affordable service anywhere in LA.<//Review>

He knew that o2 sensor is not ready and still proceed with a smog check, could've just told me to drive more but probably 25$ for pointless rechecking is worth it... 1 star, not more than that. And never raise your voice on your clients, its not Armenia.<//Review>

great smog check. I live in the burbank los angeles area, and needed something right away. I saw this service in the Glendale area, and immediately went. The reviews speak for themselves. Cheap, and very fast turnaround. awesome smog test, and my car passed with flying colors. Thank you Albert!<//review>

<review>There was no waiting time around 5pm! The pricing was a bit CONFUSING because I used the $29.95 coupon. Everything was total of $42.00 at the end. Certificate cost is $8.00 plus the Electronic Transfer fee of $4.00.< /review>< pictures>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Review>The owners of this place are lovely and super friendly! This restaurant is a hole in the wall but the food they serve are so savory and delicious that you’d have pat yourself on the back for making a stop here to sample their cuisine. The entree costs are justified by the quality and taste - and the portions are very fair. We have been eating here periodically for the past 3-4 years and we are always left happy by the experience. 😋</Review><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None<//Resp><gmap_id>0x80c2c52104155ff5:0xcf4538e6dfe41349< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

This place is tasty. So far I haven't had anything bad from here. A little on the pricier side for me but worth it every so often<//Review>

<text>Sage Bistro offers great food and service. Staff are attentive and competent. It's probably one of the few good bistros in Alhambra.
Sage Bistro is very spacious, neat and well organized. I had the deviled eggs and stuffed chicken breast with veggie mash potatoes. Prices are relatively fair $$ that match the excellent food and service. Street parking is available. I highly recommend Sage Bistro for Lunch or Dinner.< /text>< Name>

This is surely one of the most attractive place in the region. Always when I go there I am deeply pleased. They manage their high  standard service and the highest level of meals  they give. You are always happy with this place. Warmly  recommended.<//Text>

< review>
In the heart of downtown Alhambra, this intimate boutique restaurant serves up yummy dishes without too much flare or overly dramatic interior design.

The parking:
Its downtown Alhambra, you got street parking, structures close by and some spots in the back of the restaurant

The restaurant:
Clean, simple decor and quiet, perfect for a casual dinner

The food:
Its yummy, I had some of my friends dishes and everything i sampled including my own dish was good.

We got cheesecake for dessert and it was also good.

Unfortunately nothing crazy, over the top amazing or bad about the menu items. Just good and sometimes good is exactly what you are looking for.

The only comment I will say is the menu is small, this could be a major plus if you feel whelmed by larger menus</review>

Poor service. Attitude with person who picks up phone. Won’t go back or recommend others to waste their money here. Managers, choose your staff wisely because they will drive people away.</Review>

<text>The food here is pretty average. If I want to be brutally honest, this place deserves .5 stars for the food. The lady's customer service was the best thing about the place, but I can't eat customer service. I should've seen the red flags where we were the only people there, the misplaced bathroom sign that leads people to believe that the world is your dumping ground. The rice was overcooked, the dessert was watery. It was for my best friend's birthday. Although she chose the place, she regretted eating here then and later that day (we only ate here once).</text>< time>

<Text>Wanda your fabulous.  The food is superb. The service unbelievably excellent. The tastes of all the food we ordered was delicious. If you want great food then STOP looking around and head to "SAGE BISTRO" ......The stuffed chicken breast is like nothing else you have ever experienced delicious, the deviled eggs scrumptious, the chicken farfelle pasta brillant!!
We will be back...<//Text>< user>

Ordered 3 dishes for take out dinner on a Friday evening. The place looks neat and cozy. The presentation was good even in the to go containers. But the food was way too salty for our taste. The beef rib, stuffed chicken breast, and the meatballs were all too salty!<//text>

It appears the chef knows what he is doing which is very refreshing. Wanda greeted us with a smile, great conversationalist and provided great service. While I was there many people started to come in apparently regulars whom know what they were going to order. It's a great find. I intend to come back and order every dish.< /Review></record>

Good food, prices are a little high, service is good too. There’s a good variety, so I’ll have to go back more to try other things. The gelato was great! I also tried the biscuits and gravy and they were dry for my taste.<//Review>

< Review>
Fantastic place.  The quality of the food far surpasses the ambience in this restaurant. If they lowered the lighting a bit and put candles on the tables you'd find yourself at a restaurant deserving of making advance reservations.  One of the few restaurants I've been to where even the sauteed vegetables are delicious.   Oh, and the owner is a delight as well!   She always remembers where my partner and I sat the previous time and how many people came with us. That's what I call attention to your customers. Thank you!< /Review>

Don't be fooled by its modest facade, inside elegant and tastefully creative concoctions of Asian sauces and traditional European dishes await at appropriate prices.<//Review>

<review>Only been open for less than 4 months and already hitting the off the chart grade point average stars, I just had to give this a place a look-see!

Parking may be difficult as it is a very popular restaurant central spot, but be patient you won't regret your decision.

The restaurant use to be an old coffee shop, so you'll notice a bit of a narrow layout with a bit of coffee shop vibe. Don't take that as small, because it can fit big parties easily. My feeling immediately was how home-y i felt, comfortable and ready to eat!

I came with my parents and they are strict vegetarian with not even garlic and onions in their diet. Usually this can be such a headache explaining the stress of how allergic they can be when touched. With such ease and comfort our servers knew immediately and even custom made some off the menu vegetarian dishes just for us.

Not only were the presentation amazing, but on first bite into our veggie steak (made from scratch- panko, mushroom and potato) with mash potato on the side clearly gave you the feeling of eating a real steak, but with a plus no poor cows were harmed !  Right off the bat you can tell the freshness of each bite, the consistency was perfect and it almost really gave you a slight feeling of ...ummm are you sure this aint meat dude? I love how they knew we probably don't go to much steak houses, so they brought it to us! Side mushroom dishes and fresh asparagus really set the mood!

I also got a generous portion of Pasta with sun dried tomato and seriously, the portion is so big I just had to pack it to go. Plus i still had to make space for some of their infamous Tiramisu!!!

Tiramisu were yum..nough said' !

Over all 5 stars and above for amazing service, great service and did I mention delicious food?!?!?!?!< /review>< pics>

<Text>The only place I have my people go to get their piercings. My two oldest daughters have been pierced and 1 tattooed here. Danny is very professional, makes sure it is in the right place, then gets it done. Pricing is good and the place is clean. Nothing but good things to say about the place and all the staff!! Highly recommend.</Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPv9QoIuLYNVX1F6Q8RdaCrdMMdWksaz_7kAEOS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPUzNouHh2U6HU-3SWsN7Q66fJMwT3wvdkMBP8p=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOuXlDCw4Sfm8eqL_6EZDQ3866YBmqn-gr0TR3F=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics>< Response>

Went in for a consultation a month ago, made an appointment and finally got to head in for my first tattoo. Though nervous at first, everyone there was so cool I felt right at ease. Jose worked on my tattoo and it came out 100X better than I thought it would. Everyone was very nice, very professional and answered any questions I had. I'll definitely be going back for more.<//Text>

Extremely professional art. My girlfriend LOVED her tat made by Jessica. I truly hope I got her name right because she deserves the recognition. Look for the girl with the colored hair. She does phenomenal art especially "cutesy" stuff like my girlfriend explained her art to me. She does other styles too of course</review>

<text>It was my second time here. The reason I came back was the first artist that tattooed me Al was great. Second time was unfortunately not. It was a simple tattoo I was getting so I assumed just about any tattoo artist should be able to do it. Never assume. I still wanted it done by a specific artist so I called to make sure he was working that day (Not Al) and confirmed. However, when I went in and asked for the artist, apparently no one knew who he was even though his Instagram stated he worked on that specific day. In the middle of getting tattooed, the tattoo artist I was originally looking for walks in. I was so upset I couldn’t even say anything. The tattoo was looking okay however I noticed the tattoo looked faded almost right after. I addressed it with the artist and he said it just needs to heal. Two weeks later, it still looked the same. The bottom half looks good but the other half looks like it needs a retouch. Overall, the place looks great and prices are decent but the artist was pretty unprofessional.

Response:
I don’t recall the artist that tattooed me but the artist I was looking for goes by Tee.<//text><pics>None<//pics><response>{'time': 1552979982105, 'text': 'Hi. That’s so weird that the artist didn’t know who you looking for.  Which artist tattooed you and which artist were you looking for?  I want to make sure this doesn’t happen to anyone else.

<Rating>5</Rating><Text>Went here with a friend for the Friday the 13th deal. $13 tattoos with a $7 tip ($20). They also had some flat rate $30 & $40. We went late afternoon so of course we waited for hours, but the artist "T" was well worth it. The other two artists did great work and the piercings went smoothly too. The front manager kept everyone informed, chill, and the flow was even. It could've been a mad house. Rich even let me use his jumper cables when my car died in front from sitting listening to music for hours. Another couple with a midnight appointment, slid next to me and gave me the boost right before getting their ink. I think I'll be back July 13th for another baby tat!</Text>< Pictures>

I got my nose pierced by Doug. I woke up two days later and the needle went completely through.  I called him to see if he can some how compensate me by sending me another nose ring (I live an hour away) because I didn't think it was fair that I had to go buy another one two days later..  He stated that they don't send them and how is he suppose to know that I would swell the way that I did. In my response,  he spoils have considered swelling while doing it.  Cool guy just bad service<//Review>

<rating>5< /rating><text>I forgot who tatt me up but I loved his artwork. I got Los Angeles on my chest. The place has cool vibes. I'm looking for more ink in my body and I know this tattoo shop will do great. Although I live by culver city, the drive will be worth it. If anyone is thinking of getting a tattoo, this is the spot.<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

<text>Made an appointment with Eddie, he called me to reschedule, I decided to cancel the appointment. When I asked for a refund, I was told it was up to Eddie. After speaking to him, he told me that since that payment was to reserve a spot with him, he wouldn't issue a refund. Yet he called me before the appointment to try and reschedule.< /text><rating>1< /rating><user_id>100144426881887658143<//user_id><GmapID>0x80c2972288ab191b:0x239115d735b1efc3</GmapID>< response>
{'time': 1502390673140, 'text': "Hello yes deposits are usually nonrefundable. If he canceled he should have refunded. Eddie only worked for us for a couple of months and he has been gone for at least 6 months.  If you'd like to call or text me Tiffanie (the owner) I'm sure we could work something out.  818-926-3536.

<review>Horrible shop, went to get a few simple bats and a cross and they really screwed me over, definitely the worst tattoos I've gotten, it's embarrassing to have people look at them. Never going back again. Word of advice to everyone, look at an artists past work before you decide to get something done by them.</review></record></dataset><record>

Terrible experience. I was tattoed by Jay and it ended up being not at all what I expected.  I asked for a dog paw (my dog’s paw, and even brought a picture of it) and at first he draws it pointy, with long claws like a cat’s paw, it looked NOTHING like the picture. I politely asked him to fix it and make it more round and I don’t know if he was annoyed by that, but the result was a extremely faded and weird-looking tatto. I was VERY clear when I said I wanted really sharp and crispy, but he just ignored my request or maybe he is just a bad professional.<//text>

<Review>Rich Ink is soo amazing, I feel right at home, every one is very friendly, and nice. I love their prizes and specials, I got tattoo by ALEX amazing artist, and I got pierced by NICK. Alex did a wonder disney piece on my arm, it came out great I love it, Every time people ask me who did it or when i went to get it... I tell them at Rich Ink by Alex. I will be coming back for more piercing and tattoos. =]
thanks guys!

The pizza was very good. All of the ingredients seemed fresh and they got all of our orders completely right. It was just on the pricey side, as for a family of 4 we paid over $100. I would recommend this place if you want to enjoy a very tasty pizza. One recommendation for them is to have syrup on the side for the breakfast pizza.< /text>

Wow, i mean wow i was greeted in the most genuinely friendly, warm, welcoming way that I've had in years.  The waitress was helpfull, conversational and new her stuff.  Good atmosphere and a beautiful madrone bar like none you'll see elsewhere.  The beer is cold and they got a slew of 'em on tap as apparently cans and bottles in the cooler.  I ordered the Supreme brick fire pizza with pineapple "yes pineapple goes on pizza" . Crispy crust and it was absolutely delicious.  If you're passing through you'd be remiss if you pass this little gem by.</review>

<review>Very authentic Italian Pizza.

We had dinner at this place. The service was friendly and helpful.
All of us had pizza and I have to say the pizza at "the Madrone" is the best pizza I had in the entire USA!
It has a very authentic Italian dough, the toppings were fresh and they offer authentic prosciutto.
All in all a perfect meal for a reasonable price.</review><date>1546578813259</date>< userid>

< Review>
The service was okay not very attentive. I got the Caesar salad it’s was okay light dressing which isn’t bad just not what I expected from a Caesar salad. The pizza has great flavor and it’s not too greasy which I love!!! However, I wished the pizza was cooked a little longer it was a little doughy. Also a little light on condiments derives ranch, peppers ect.<//Review>

Order the jalapeno poppers. Don't think about it. Just order them. Thank me later. Then choose from their pizzas. The Madrone and Humboldt Fog are crazy good. As is their tap selection. Only wish I could sit at the bar...but you know... Covid.<//Text>

This place was incredibly delicious! The pizza is fresh, and we'll seasoned, not over sauced like other places. 10/10 from me!

They have all kinds of beer and ciders on tap, but the draft root beer might have been my favorite beverage!! 😁<//text>

Love the gluten free crust! This place has the best brick fire pizza I have ever tasted. They also have great kombucha on tap!</Text>

Family friendly is correct. The menu was pizza and some salad options - felt like eating pizza you cooked at home, kinda basic but tasty.< /text>

<Text>Friendly staff. Pizza was very good - we did not have to wait too long for the food. I liked the thin crust.
Beer was excellent.
Only that if you want to eat from a plate you get a paper plate is kind of irritating. What‘s it in the US with all that throw away dishes?!</Text>< pictures>

Great rotating beer selection,  always something new to try.  The pizzas are small (they tell you this so it's not a surprise) but they sure do taste great.  Awesome dough, great toppings,  and cool combinations.<//Text>

<Text>The pizzas here are really good and not that pricey. They have a super good selection of rotating taps. I'm a cider fan and they had several great local ones. Perfect location for Eureka Farmers Market or Arts Alive side eats or drinks.< /Text>< time>

The wait was 45 minutes and only several other people were in the restaurant.
The pizza was possibly the worst I've ever had eaten. Little Cezars you have no worries.</Text>

Always tasty. Trivia nights are a blast. Now they do them on Thursdays too which was a great surprise. I was just stopping in for the wings and some chevre flatbread and woohoo! Disney Trivia night complete with Disney music. An odd though pleasant break from the metal show down the road.</text>

We're from out of state and stumbled upon this cool place. It was one of the best pizzas I've had in a long time! We got 1/2 Hawaiian  and 1/2 Italian. The Prickly Pear sparkling mimosa was really good. Great atmosphere and Ashley was a good sport even when my husband kept calling her Lisa because she looked like his cousin.  The owner is super friendly and brought the pizza out to us himself and checked on how we were doing. Definitely should check it out!< /Text>

<review>The place was great.  I had The Duke.  Very yummy.  But while I was there San Francisco lost against Green Bay by three points.  So I dunno.  My night could have been perfect.  I know it's out of their control... but, 4 out of 5 stars because the niners lost.</review>< pics>

Nice they had tv's place nicely and service was great.  I didn't care for decorations. Wasn't my taste but I think others would like it a lot.  Really cool they had a bunch of board games for family's to play together.  There was 5 family's that knew each other playing the board games while eating food.  They where having some sort of special event.  Over all nice family and positive atmosphere and would recommend  any one if they haven't stop by to stop by and check them out.

It was alright the food was good, the prices were decent. It just felt average and when it was closing time everything just sort of collapsed, lights were dimmed windows closed ect and we were ignored. We tried to leave before closing time but service took quite a while. I'd recommend the goat pizza though.< /Text>

The pizza is amazing, the beverage choices will make you feel like a kid in a candy store, and the staff will make you feel like you’re home.  If you’re in Eureka and you want good pizza, this is the place to go.</text>

When I walked in it smelled like that childhood neighborhood pizza parlor that would have all the games. It became immediately apparent that the games were the ones on tv, surrounded by good company. It was that comfortable sportsbar vibe with a clean and classy atmosphere, and at the same time family friendly. A great balance. The service was amazing with cheerful Ashley, and with its rotating wide variety of beers on the digital menu I lacked for nothing. I loved everything about it! And when it came time to e the t the pizza, it was the best part.<//review>

Great beer selection, pizza was awesome, live music was not ear-splittingly loud. One criticism is that they have one screen for the beer menu, but they need two. You'll be in the middle of reading a description and it switches to the next page.< /review>

<Review>I don't see the point of using good ingredients and then burning the pizza and obviously not sweeping out the oven properly leaving burnt bits from other orders on the bottom of our pie.
20 beers on tap but there selection was weak.
The place was clean and interesting with the pizza art and the bar tender/waiter was good.
I did grow up in the north east coast so the pizza standards are high.<//Review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

Good pizza and Caesar salad, also tried one of the specials was a chicken calzone, it was delicious. A little high priced for my budget and don't go if you're in a hurry.< /review>

<date>1562361166429< /date><Rating>3< /Rating><Review>I cannot evaluate the beers on tap has I did not have any while I was there.
I did order the Woodfired Pizza which is the reason why I came.
Seemed to take a little longer than what I would have thought was normal considering they were not busy at all. But I did not mind this as I was there for that Wood Fired Pizza.
It was not bad, but it wasn't great either so I gave them a three, which is average. I know it's hard to believe but there are other Woodfired pizzas in the area. Which I have referred to in previous post and given those places a four star. The service was average, she seemed more interested in serving the bar patrons.
The price was comprable to the pizza that I got, not overpriced or  underpriced. I guess what I'm saying with this post; is that, sure go try it on your own see what you think. Next time I'll bring some friends just to see what they think want to make sure it's just not me.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

Just don't try it!  This was our second experience eating here and the only reason we went this time was because that's where our friends were already going. The entire order was messed up. Started no gluten free pizza crust. Than the wrong cheese on 1 pizza, than sausage on another pizza, than 1 pizza they forgot to cook, the nachos were awful like something you might expect from a school carnival. And, everyone's food came at different times, in fact the last pizza was so late the waitress brought it out in a box without us requesting her to do so. At least they compted our drinks.<//text>

Bit like the TARDIS in Dr. Who. Different on the inside. Great brewery themed nights and homestyle pizza. Barmaid was awesome...but you knew that...</Review>

<text>The service was friendly. The food was okay. It was open late on a Friday which is how I ended up here. By 10pm we were the only people in the restaurant. The pizza was okay. Not a lot of flavor. But if you are ever in need of a meal late at night, this is an okay spot</text><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None<//Resp></record>

I would highly recommend this location to get your car smogged. They also welcome coupons when presented. This is the only place I go to when I need to get a smog performed.< /review>

A great family owned spot to be in and out that’s located extremely close to the Carmichael, CA Department of Motor Vehicles. Even if your turned away from the DMV for not having your smog certificate you’re able to drive down and get it Smogged before the DMV closes for the day. The do both Gas and diesel certificates.</Text>

Had both my cars smogged here. They were fast and efficient. One of my cars failed due to a bad catalytic converter, which had to be replaced. It then passed just fine the second time around. I'll be back here again.< /Review>

<review>I was there on Thursday for a foot and body massage. The young gentleman who massaged me literally gave me the worst massage I've ever had. In the 1 hr service, he got up and left at least 5 times for more than 3 minutes each time. Barely massaged my feet or back. Did no kind of deep tissue massage at all. Could say more, but I won't.

I tip very well, so It may have been just the masseuse I was paired with, but I left highly disappointed.</review><UserId.>111200181649797698079< /UserId.>< Resp>

Me and my mom go here every month as part of our self care routine. They are wonderful every time!! Usually it's very quiet with relaxing music. I'd highly recommend this to anyone who wants affordable, and wonderful massages.<//text>

I just walked out of a couples massage I was very happy with the communication from the front desk at first  the masseuse that took care of me was attentive professional and took the time to stretch out my legs thighs and arms I am very happy with the way she chose to work on my back releasing all of the tension at the end we were given a choice of a tip I had a 20 I asked for 5$ bills the front desk gave me two 10$ and I had no choice but to tip them how they wanted to be tipped my husband said his massage could of been better if the lady put some more effort into it over all I was pleased until the end that was a uneasy feeling but other than that I feel pretty good</text>

Big communication issues. The receptionist spoke adequate English. But the masseuse either did not understand me or acknowledge my requests. She rushed through the massage, rough and my wife left there worse than she went in. Will not go here again.< /text>

An excellent no frills, no thrills reflexology place. I got an EXCELLENT 60 minute deep tissue massage focusing on my sore shoulders and neck, but also included massage/reflexology on my whole body. Got the knots out and feel relaxed and refreshed. Great investment of $40+tip! :)</Text>

<Response>None</Response><Date>1457203965515<//Date><text>Great place great massage and reasonable prices. I was very impressed with the value for the service. I lived in China for a long time and could afford to go regularly for massage, but since I came back to the states I think the prices are too high and do not go very often. My sister in law turned me on to this place while staying with them in Elk Grove. Wow what a delight. The massage was a great deep tissue massage for my head, neck, feet, back, and legs. I asked for a little extra emphasis on my lower back. The young lady giving me the massage was awesome and relieved my pain in no time. I paid $40 for a 90 minute massage which was great and was so good in fact I went back the next day. Wish they had one of these by my house as I would go weekly. Love to be pampered and Chinese style reflexology is great for loosening up my old aching body.< /text>< Gmap_id>

Everytime I go here I have an amazing time and experience. I always go with the one hour foot and body massage where they spend 30 minutes on your head and feet then 30 minutes on your shoulder and back. The massages are always super relaxing and you leave the massage feeling relaxed. They have a massage level system to how hard or light you want the massage to be and during the massage you are able to ask if you want it a little harder or softer.< /Text>

This is my first time at Foot & Body Reflexology in Elk Grove. I went to this place because my favorite masseuse is now working there. She used to work at Zen Day Spa on Freeport Blvd but management decided to change a lot of the masseuses that worked there and now she works in Elk Grove. Angel is my masseuse and she is the best masseuse I have had, she knows what areas of my body that bother me and she spends a little extra time with my problem areas. A one hour massage costed me $40. Angel starts with my shoulders and upper back and then she works her way down to problematic back. She slowly massages my lower back to help loosen my muscles. Angel is wonderful always asking how I feel and is she working the right area. A true professional.  After working my back she gets hot towels and places them on my back to help further relax my muscles. Then she massages my legs. After finishing my legs she gets more hot towels and places them on my legs to relax them. She then removes the towels from my back and the cleans the rest of my upper body. She then finishes by removing and wiping my legs. Angel then ask me to turn over. She states with a face massage then moves to my upper chest and arms. All the time asking if I was comfortable. Angel then massages my feet and legs. She then stretches my feet and legs. She then tells me that she is done. I get dressed and walk out of the room to find Angel waiting for me with some water. I drink the water and give Angel her tip and said that I will see her next time. I always feel better after having a massage by Angel. She is a polite and respectful woman and I treat her with the same. I will see her again.<//Review>

The ice cream there is very good. We always go there for an ice cream cake when we are celebrating a birthday. It helps to order ahead of time so you can order the flavor of the ice cream and the kind of cake you want but if you didn't, the already made cakes have popular flavors you can choose from.< /Text>

It's a classic ice cream establishment. I just wish it wasn't so pricey, but they do give big scoops to be fair.

Tip: always keep you receipt and do the online survey (takes 2 minutes) to save $1 on your next purchase.</Review>

It's cheap but not as cheap as I assumed. Lots of fun flavors that are loaded with sugar. Again, great for kids< /Review><username>Kevin Kwok<//username>< gmapID>

Ordered for delivery from this location and they completely screwed up on the order. When I called to speak with a manager to explain, I was passed over to what seemed to be a child claiming she was the manager and that the problem needed to be taken up with doordash cuz she wasn't responsible. Since when does door dash cook the food or in this case scooped the ice cream I order? It is baskin Robin's responsibility to put together the accurate order to be delivered. Not to mention the girl was extremely rude and gave an attitude the entire phone call.  I I suggest you properly train your employees before letting them deal with your customers!<//review>

Excellent service, ice cream is delicious and plenty of ice cakes to take home. The  place is clean with plenty of seating inside and out.   Only complaint is yes a little expensive however personally totally worth it!<//Review>

I find myself going to Baskin-Robbins only when they have a deal. Most of the time I find myself at Rite Aid getting an ice cream at Thrifty's which is a hundred times better than Baskin Robbins and their 31 flavors. Somehow someway even with 31 Flavors I never seem to find the one that I want.</review>

<Rating>2< /Rating><Text>I USED TO LOVETHIS PLACE 😍😍😍 I come  here frequent me and my bestfreind are kinda like regulars I order the cookie sandwich ice cream and I always ask for double scoop and there's never a problem the girls that work here or used to are always friendly. Today I order the same thing 3 cookies 2 on each side and one in between the two double scoop. The Chinese girl kept refusing that I was wrong and she was right on how to make it when I've been having it like that every time Ive been going. She was rude and had attitude. I kept explaining her how to do it and she didn't care. Im not asking for much I just wanted a cookie ice cream sandwich done the right way.< /Text><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

Delicious as always. I did squeeze hot chilli juice in my eye and that sucked. Still worth the meal though.</review>

<rating>2<//rating><text>In n out is one of my fave fast food burgers, however, I always go to the one in Pleasanton. It was only until yesterday I went to this one and I sadly experienced not one, but two strands of long hair in my burger! I was really hungry last night and I wasn’t able to enjoy my dinner because of this. So please be careful in the back. The fries weren’t that bad tho.<//text>< Response>

I had to place a big order and they were very helpful and clarified with me multiple times to make sure my order was correct. Conner was very helpful and I appreciated them helping me carry everything to my car as well. Food is delicious and their customer service went above and beyond for me.<//Review>

Consistently serving cheap and fresh tasting hamburgers. Some of my favorite french fries, which can be made even better by adding melted cheese or having them made "Animal Style". A wonderful selection of soft drinks and classic tasting milkshakes, In-N-Out makes shame of the old fashioned rule that things cant be quick, cheap, and good tasting all at the same time. For Californians and people who have frequented the West Coast, this should feel nostalgic. For anyone who hasn't had the chance to taste it, In-N-Out will undoubtedly remain the one of the highlights of their trip to the Bay Area.</Text>

We waited over 20 minutes for our order, even though the line at the cashier wasn't long before us, just one or two customers.

When we got our food, it was already cool and not hot at all.

They didn't offer ketchup and were very slow to refill our drinks.

Food itself was normal, hence the 3 stars.

Overall a subpar In-N-Out experience. We'll try to avoid it next time we're in the area.</Review>

<Review>This is definitely one of the better in-n-out out there!! Compared to other locations I’ve been to, the burgers here are all fresh and supppper delicious! The fries were not too dry and the burgers were pretty juicy. Everything about this location was fantastic! I bet you’ll also enjoy eating here as well.

They’re also hiring right now. Starting from $17.00 to $19.50</Review><response>None<//response>< rate>

Really really good burgers. Not "Wait in line for 4-6 hours for the new place" good (what is though), but really good and wonderful service. Super clean and friendly.< /Review>

In N out burgers use all the best ingredients, which makes all the difference. I hope they switch to plant based soon. We need to save our planet.</Review>

A tremendous nightmare starting with the parking and lack of empathy for covid-19. This particular location does not care about covid-19 cases or if you get sick or not. With a rush to open their doors so quickly, it's no wonder people are flocking to this place like the plague. I've seen people go in (only once & final time) without a mask and come out coughing and panting. If that's the case, they might as well let the whole city of Tracy in and avoid the rules altogether, making it impossible for you to get into the hospital if you need to. Although they have signs on the doors, people are still being let in maskless, crowded lines and less cleaning. The parking lot intrudes on the smaller businesses around it, meaning you can't park anywhere to get to those small shops, you have to park across the street. It was also closed briefly during the pandemic to sanitize the entire store in which didn't help but only for a few days. But like all places, if someone has tested positive for covid-19, that person may or may not wish to disclose that information with the company, in great fear of losing their job. Not much they can do about it, but if you're worried about contracting the virus, you may want to opt out of fast food for awhile and this place is no exception. The lines are ridiculously long and the customers are impatient, rude and negligent. Good luck waiting an hour in the drive thru. No thanks.</text>

<Rating>5</Rating><Review>The fries here are different and delicious. The employees were friendly, cheerful, and looked like they enjoy working here. I ordered a hamburger with nothing on it except extra pickles and they put just the right amount of pickles. The place was very busy with an almost full parking lot and a long drive thru line but we did not have to wait long for our food. Even in such a busy time, the restaurant was clean.< /Review>< username>

Animal-style burger & strawberry shake were awesome as always.  I think  InO fries are inconsistent between stores and altogether meh, so I don't order them any longer.  But, InO fries have their avid fans, so suit yourself.< /Review>

Fast service, bit of wait during rush hour, burgers looked and tasted great. Friendly employees. Everything was overall a great experience that I have come to expect when visiting any In n Out. Drive thru only at the moment only because of social distancing but the wait wasn't too bad.< /review>

They got the order wrong again.  Three different people ordered the same thing at two different locations.    Stop and listen to the order . It's written correct but put together wrong in the kitchen.< /Review>

<Text>Best place to get burgers ever! Honest business, always clean (at every location I went to), food was fresh and fully cooked, plus the employees are polite and never rude. Not the normal fast food restaurant you go to.
Definitely a great place to go! Food prices are cheap as well.< /Text>< Pictures>

Yes, the service is great, everyone smiles, the food comes out on time and overall it's just a solid experience. But, the food is just average fast food type. I prefer shake shack and five guys over this in-n-out burger and the fries were disappointing. I like crispy fries and these were not that. A decent late night snack option, but I wouldn't go out of my way.</text></record></dataset><record>

What's there not to love about in and out? Oh yeah no Bacon and Green Chile lol. Regardless the nicest staff you will ever get in the fast food industry, be prepared to stay parked for a while, but well worth it.< /Text>

I moved to Central OR from CA 15 years ago. Today I was in Livermore CA visiting a relative. One of the first things I did was Google In-N-Out Burger. Nothing compares to it! It's in a class of its own from the personnel staff to the hand cut fries. Top of the line. My meal was fabulous-double double cheeseburger and fries. I wish this franchise would come to Central OR! But for now, just nostalgia.<//review>

I have liked In-N-Out Buger for a long time. I used to have to wait until I went to LA to get my burger fix back in the '80s. You can't go wrong with fresh made French fries either.< /review>

<review>I had a great experience here.
I had a custom order and Nalini did a great job! What moved me to make this review was the following. I was happy already when withi received my order, as I was grabbing some condiments, Kelsey stopped me and said to return my fries 🍟. She was not satisfied with the quality of that batch I was given. She grabbed them and gave me a new batch. This act reminded me of Chef Ramsey doing a quality control. I was very happy and felt great. Thank you guys.<//review><gmap_id>0x808fe7ace7d15f17:0xe6db0a27818c9505< /gmap_id></record>

4th time in 6+ days, super consistent, why does fountain Coke taste so good from all In N Out locations? Maybe they just follow instructions, who knows, hot chilis, just like every OG burger stand in LA used to have.< /text>

<Review>Good place for burgers, fries and shakes. I really don't care for the thousand island dressing or whatever that sauce is they put on burgers but leave that stuff out and you have a better tasting burger. Tip. Keep the dining room clean. I observed 8 messy tables with no attention.<//Review><Gmap_id>0x808fe7ace7d15f17:0xe6db0a27818c9505<//Gmap_id><response>None< /response><Rating>4< /Rating><user_id>108191007994007563921</user_id><Date>1583280183919<//Date></record></dataset><record>

Best service in town. Rarely do the make a mistake and the only time they did, they were so good about it. They also have no problem making a keto compatible burger. I can't remember what the burger is called, but they'll know.<//text>

The protein style double double is pretty much the best gluten free burger option I've come across at a drive-thru - nice crisp lettuce in place of the bun but held together well and tasted amazing. Great friendly service as always, plus the shakes are delicious!<//Text>

Ever since this place has opened up (it's been around for a decade) it has given exceptional service. Its fast food the doesn't disappoint but for once the service and people don't either.<//review>

Second oddest was that the "dine-in" tray they served the two of us had about 2/3rds the fries in one fry container and 1/3 in the other. The size discrepancy was shocking.< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

The king of fast food burgers, period! I quantify fast food as something you don't have to exit your vehicle for. Are there better burgers to be had? Yes, but there is nothing that compares for the price and availability. Oh yeah BTW, the burgers are off the hook no matter what.</review>

On my recent trip back to California I made sure that one of my first stops as soon as the plane landed was to visit my long lost animal style fries. They taste as great as I remember.

Probably one of the best burgers you can get on the West coast. Always consistent always fresh and always good tasting. I usually go for a protein style Double-Double hamburger.the only not I have is at this place always has constantly long lines either inside the store or outside in the drive through. But hey, that is the price you pay for a great-tasting, affordable, and classic hamburger.< /Text>< Pictures>

You can order it however you like raw onions cooked onions more meat extra cheese I also like that the french fries are cooked fresh they don't have a cheap fast food taste.

<Text>We frequent this In N Out a lot... The staff are always super kind and attentive to customized orders. The food is always great but if there's something you dont like, they make it again for you. The dining room and restrooms are well kept and stocked everytime we've gone. During peak hours, they can handle the rush and still are just as attentive to the specific customer. A++ service, attitude, and facilities.</Text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None</response><gmap_id>0x808fe7ace7d15f17:0xe6db0a27818c9505<//gmap_id></record>

If you are a keto eater, get the 4x4 protein style. It is super filling. Tastes great with coffee!<//Text>

Fast, clean and delicious. Took our family of five and got out of there for under $40. Service was great and they got all of our orders right. And all of this while they were super busy.< /text>

Stopped by for a quick bite to eat with a friend. We were in the mood for fries so we decided to head inside instead of the drive through line thinking it would be quicker. It was around 2:30pm and we waited 15 minutes for 2 orders of french fries only.  Overall was disappointed in the wait time, but enjoyed my food. I would probably recommend to go thru the drive thru window at this location. It's really packed on the inside every time I go and the drive thru line seems to move quicker.</text>

I've been to quite a few In-N-Outs and this one was particularly good. It's easy and right off the highway. Plus the staff was super friendly. It was almost table service. One worker came and picked up our trays without us even asking. Highly recommend< /Text>

The best fast food burgers.
If the burger is the bit you care most about, go here.
They have some weird management practices, like the bible verse citations on the bottoms of the cups and trays, but it is mostly fine. The verse cited on the milkshake cups is anathemic to all intellectualism though; maybe don't buy a milkshake.</Review>

I gotta say I've never seen a friendlier fast food place. The cashier, Michelle, helped a customer in front of me change their order way after they ordered and make sure they were satisfied. Was very friendly while taking my order. Then I saw a lady ask for a bag and what was both funny and very customer service, she was asked if she needed help by 3 to 4 employees in about 30 seconds. Food was good as usual. My only gripe is that my animal fries were put in the steamer about 5 times and were soggy. Not crispy like normal.<//Review>

<Text>Hard to say much about an In-N-Out. I find them much more consistent than any other burger chain. This one is typical. The burgers and everything else is prepared exactly as a customer would expect. Dinner was delicious and quickly served. If you like In-N-Out, you will like this one. If you like a well made basic burger, you will like this one. If you want a fancy, gourmet burger, this may nonot be what you want.<//Text><Gmap_id>0x808fe7ace7d15f17:0xe6db0a27818c9505<//Gmap_id></record>

Have you ever seen an In-n-Out without a single person sitting at a table? That's what happens when you have a pandemic. To-go orders only.<//Text>

Staff are super friendly and professional.  Wait times can be a little long during lunch and dinner rush (10-15m, 20m in extreme cases) so plan for that.</Text>

<Text>In and Out it's by far one of my favorite hamburger places and loved note just by me and my family...but by so many other people! Just check out the line of cars to go thru the drive thru!
They use fresh cut potatoes for your French fries and all fresh food for your burgers!
Hint: when you go to order, look up their secret menu online....
I always order a....
DOUBLE DOUBLE ANIMAL STYLE!

Have it "animal" style.  You can watch as the potatoes are pressed through the fry grater.< /Text>

<username>Alfred Herrero<//username><review>Great food and very fast service! My wife and I stopped in Pleasanton's In N' Out and left due to the excessive line, and parking lot traffic.

Lo' N' Behold 7 miles away lies this golden opportunity for the restaurant. Food fast fast, line was short and faster, and food is how you would expect from this organization.

We also learned that In N Out can cut the burger in quarters for our Toddler, which we greatly appreciated!</review>< time>

<Text>Who can't say no to in n out. The juicy patties with melting cheese on top along with a animal fries and a cold coke.  Love in n out. It's a must have at least once a month. Once I had in n out 20 times in a month and still tasted good each time. The drive thru here can get long during lunch and dinner but they send someone out to take the orders for a fast service. The shakes aren't bad. I like the strawberry shake. Soon I have to try a 4x4 cheeseburger. But I'm saving it for when I'm starving and craving in n out. So pretty soon..</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

Simple and quick. Exactly what I want from fast food. Even still I believe the value you get is more than what you pay. Don't expect restaurant quality but know it is a better option to it's equivalents.<//text>

This In-N-Out-burger location is always busy with drive trough, I love the burger 🍔 and fries 🍟. I mostly use the drive trough service. My only problem is the wait time, it’s mostly a long line but other than that everything is perfect 👌<//review>

This is the best in-n-out I have ever come across. The burgers were well seasoned. Fries were crispy and actually salted. They got the order correct. I didn't have to repeat myself. If I am ever up here again, I will definitely come back here.  live in southern California and they always mess up on my order and give raw meat and soggy fries. (Fyi never go to the in-n-out in industry, CA on Colima Rd.)< /text>

<review>Nothing beats an old fashioned double cheese burger. The ultimate in comfort food. At In-N-Out it's always cooked right!!< /review><UserId.>101093377549127638472< /UserId.></record>

This particular location is great and worth a review. Most In N Out's can be chaotic and difficult to deal with. This one is busy too but they are very efficient and keep the place clean. I rarely have a hard time getting a table. And the food is delicious as usual. Great staff, well ran.<//text>

Drive through line is always long but if you go inside service is much faster. The food is very good and not greasy. Everything is fresh and made to order.<//Text>

Always a fan of going to In-N-Out when I'm out west. It is something all out of towners should do. I got the double double animal style. So good and well priced. It can take some time to get your food unlike other fast food places but the wait is worth it.<//Text>

I hadn't eaten here in years. It didn't taste the way I remembered. I don't eat fast food very often so the problem may be with me.

The service was excellent as usual.<//Text>

<review>I thought In And Out was still the best after 8 years, but my most recent trip here in December made me sad. My order took about 20 minutes during a lunch rush and it was only 2 burgers with fries. What I hoped to be superb in every way turned ended up where the buns were burnt and the fries devoid of salt or oil. I honestly believe I would have a better time at wendys close by.<//review><Name>iamageek500</Name><pictures>None</pictures></record></dataset><record>

Wait wasn't very long and all the employees seemed really nice. There was one guy that smiled the ENTIRE time I was there. Literally every time I looked at him he was smiling as he walked around cleaning and giving people their food. He's pretty cool and seemed incredibly nice. He threw away our trash for us too.</text>

<text>This food chain is highly overrated. There are no options, there is always a wait. This chain features food that is fresh to death, but thats all. Fresh isn’t always enough to be tasty. The fries could really use a tastier oil and the burgers need some seasoning. A good side sauce could do the small menu some justice.<//text><Name>Devon Casey< /Name>< rate>

It's In-N-Out burger. The food is amazing. Service was fast and easy. I enjoy the classic double double. It's great having always fresh ingredients. It's a must stop!<//review>

<review>Todays dine-in experience just somehow was even more pleasant then my drive thru one a couple of days ago -
Best part of both visits =
During peak weekday lunch hours, employees were calm & collective without making you feel rushed unlike certain other so called burger joints within that surrounding area with in the same daily timeframe.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

<user>106499115020784131740</user><review>Had a tight schedule Monday morning around 11am, but wanted my children from Chicago who had already eaten to have a taste of what was suppose to be In-N-Out.
Order 2 fries, 2 milkshakes and one plain cheese burger. After watching the drive in be served for about 12 minutes I asked how long it should take for 2 fries, 2 milkshakes and 1 cheeseburger. After another 5 minutes we finally got our to go order 18 minutes later.
For any walkins expect a In-N-Wait experience.
Don't really need to go back when you've got Val's Burgers as an option...

The past couple of months my food has been burnt and fries aren’t cooked all the way. The woman working at the window giving the food is so rude and disrespectful, she completely ignored me while she was standing right in front of me, thank god some other woman behind her took it upon herself to do the other woman’s job.

I think this place needs some new employees because obviously this location is going downhill with the attitude of the employees and employees just not cooking the food properly. I’d recommend to just drive down to the Pleasanton location.</Text>< Pics>

The place to stop when you are on the road and want to take the guesswork out of what you are going to eat. Because it is travel convenient and consistent in quality, it is always busy.</Text>

I don't understand why California people are obsessed with In N Out saying it is the best burger place in the state. I have tried it twice and the burger is not terrible, but nothing special. If anything, it is a bit too greasy for me. Not even any plastic forks were provided. The fries are really bad though, not even warm and no taste to them, barely even yellow when they should be golden. And the menu is so limited, in the USA it seems crazy that there is such a place with basically nothing except fries and beefburgers to eat, not even chicken burgers or bacon burgers.</text>

Even late at night, this In-N-Out was packed. That said, the staff was friendly while remaining stunningly quick. Burgers and shakes were excellent as expected.</review>

I always go after class for lunch at 11. That is the perfect time to walk in and get a burger, before the rush. Very nice customer service and burgers are always delicious. Never had an issue with them.<//Text>

Heading out of town to go skiing with Bay Area traffic is a lesson in patience. Half our drive time was spent just getting to Livermore from the South Bay. Luckily we all had a craving for burgers and this is right off the freeway. I was hoping to wait for the Tracy one but we were just going too slow. Lucky to because when we drove by the Tracy one the car line was into the street and the parking lot was packed.
I tried out a double double animal style with green chilies off the not so secret menu and it was good but still not enough chilies. I didn't want to risk getting them chili cheese fries on a long road trip. Will have to save that adventure for a closer potty.< /Text>

I tried 2 times in n out burgers. And both times were disgusting. Not going there anymore once. The fries are 100% blend, they taste like flour and the burger steak+ bun have a very cheap taste. I guess I could have expected it.< /review>

Food was cold when we got it.  Waited 30 minutes to get it and had to ask why they took 5 orders in front of ours. They made my 86 year old father wait needlessly. We won't go back there.<//Text>

What's not to love about In-N-Out. Great fresh fries, delicious burgers, secret menus, refillable drinks (hasn't seem to catch on in Asia) and customizable items. I wish they had a chain in Asia.

One of my stops every time I go home to California.< /Text>

As a guy from New York with the only similar place being Johnny Rockets or Wendy's, the price and quality can't be beat. Best place to go for a good, quick, yet cheap burger fix.<//text>

You can never go wrong with In-N-Out Burger. The staff is always pleasant and my order is always right.  The wait may be a little long at time but it's In-N-Out so it's worth it.< /text>

<Text>Loves it. I would recommend a milkshake . they are very delicious. Very popular.Drive thru is very full most of the time I go there. The fries there are very fresh. I would recomend a using a milkshake as a dip for frys. That is a very good combination.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

<Text>This store was very crowded when we were there. That being said, they did a nice job getting our food quickly. It was loud at the outside tables due to freeway noise. Had my standard Gluten Free Flying Dutchman with fries, with an iced tea. I think the total was about $6.00 for my meal.< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< GmapID>

Everybody knows this place already. If you are from Mars this review is for you. They serve beef with raw veggies between 2 buns. Less one star for constant wait to get food, which is worth it.</text>

i think only californian natives like these place. the french fries are not good at all and the burger is decent but the line is so so so long and why do they make the workers wear those weird clothes? also when i come with my friends (which i have a lot of) we don’t fit at one table but the tables and chairs are attached to the ground so we have to sit separate. wow<//review>

<Review>Went there one night and saw a huge rats cross the drive thru lane on multiple locations. Very gross!

However, the food was good. Just didn't like seeing all the rats when trying to eat a hamburger.<//Review>< pics>

What else can I say, it's In-N-Out Burger! If you are visiting CA this is a must do -- This particular location is very typical of In-N-Outs, the food is consistent, the staff is friendly, and the wait can be long (especially drive thru).  I recommend the double-double with grilled onions (always order the grilled onions with any In-N-Out burger).< /Text>

Usually a long line in the drive through during lunch and dinner rush, but they move you through daily quickly. They're very friendly and have never messed up an order for me.< /Review>

Service is good, as are the burgers, but something is off with their fries. They always taste stale, or like the fry oil hasn't been changed in a while.</Review>

Even though this location is always busy, I always stop here headed home on 580. Their speed at getting people through is unlike any other In-N-Out I've been to (which is saying something, as they're pretty fast).</Review>

double burger, fries, and shake for less than $10 how do you go wrong. Not a big fan of the fries though, they cook them a lil too long, theyre basically potato chips. 4 stars nonetheless</review>

I don't really like in and out burger last time I had bought the classic cheeseburger with the meal fries and soda, and when I took a bite from the burger I had realized the meat was raw so instead of eating I ended up fries which was the only thing I liked< /Review>

The food really isn't that great compared to McDonald's and other fast food restaurants, also In-n-out burgers have a significantly more calories than other places too. Not a place I would go to other than to get a milkshake.</text>

(Translated by Google) Excellent burger place, fresh and of a regular size. You can ask for the option to change the bread for lettuce.

(Original)
Excelente lugar de hamburguesas, frescas y de tamaño regular. Se puede pedir la opcion de cambiar el pan por lechuga.< /text>

<Text>(Translated by Google) A decent hamburger at an inexpensive price. Because it is a famous chain, it is worth visiting. But if you need to find a restaurant because it is close to a good fast food restaurant, it is not too bad to look for other alternatives. Patty likes to add.

(Original)
비싸지 않은 가격에 괜찮은 맛의 햄버거. 원체 유명한 체인이라 한 번 가볼만은 한데 가성비 좋은 패스트푸드점에 가까워서 맛집을 찾아야겠다면 꼭 여기 말고 다른 대안을 찾아보는 것도 나쁘진 않음. 패티는 추가하는 게 좋아요.</Text>< pictures>

(Translated by Google) The hamburger was double wrapped and only half inside (feeling like a crescent) was tight, so it was hard to break down to the end and it was easy to eat. Lettuce, tomato and onion were fresh and delicious. Potato is delicious in McDonald's in Japan.

(Original)
ハンバーガーは二重に包んであって、内側は半分だけ（三日月のような感じ）きつめにつつんであるので、最後まで崩れにくくて食べやすかったです。レタス、トマト、玉ねぎは新鮮で美味しかったです。ポテトは日本のマクドナルドの方が美味しいかな。< /text>

(Translated by Google) I do not think it is a chain store delicious!
The clerk is bright and friendly and the work is fast.
Hamburgers are devised to make it easier to eat, and the taste is also good!
French fries are crisp and tasty even when time goes on. Salt is a separate attachment so you can adjust the taste yourself.
Ice tea was impressive that cut lemon was put. Everything is Good.

(Original)
チェーン店と思えないおいしさ！
店員さんは明るくて愛想がよくて、仕事が早い。
ハンバーガーは食べやすいように工夫されており、味もGood！
フレンチフライはカリッとしていて時間が立ってもおいしいです。塩は別添えなので自分で味の調整ができますよ。
アイスティーはカットレモンが置いてあるのが印象的でした。すべてがGoodです。</Text>
