Love this place, they have nice vintage/antique items. It's not thrift store prices on everything so don't expect that but reasonably priced on some. The biggest selection is clothes if that's the kind of place you're looking for.</Review>

A bit over priced. Know your vintage items and collectable.  Sometimes there are good deals.< /review>

$30 for a pair of used tennis shoes? Absurd. Salvation Army seems to have lost track of the mission here. Denim was priced around $25 - weird, nothing special. No price on the sailboat, I object on principle.</review>

Large selection, decent prices and I enjoy the daily sales - usually 50% off clothes that have been there for over 6ish weeks. I just wish they sorted the jeans by size as it can be really hard to find a good pair. Also they don’t have dressing rooms which is a bit frustrating but there’s lots of mirrors everywhere which is a plus< /review>

Made the mistake of being environmentally conscious and coming here by bike with my bike panniers. No dedicated bike parking and panniers are not allowed inside.  Definitely not leaving my $160 panniers outside in this neighborhood.</Text>

<text>The Salvation Army used to have a store out back that offered lower prices, but they closed it.  It stands to reason that, in doing so, they lost their less-well-off customers who could no longer afford their higher prices.
Additionally, they now no longer allow backpacks in their store- nor will they accommodate them behind their desk.  In other words, if you are carrying a backpack, you are not welcome there, period.
Go to the Show Love Thrift Store, a few blocks south on Park instead.  They accommodate better on both counts.< /text><name>Mitch Stricker</name>< resp>

<review>The place was very clean and the prices were okay. The only thing that really bugged me was that they didn’t have any fitting rooms to try on the clothes then they have a final sale policy. How could you not have a place where the customers can try on clothes then say “okay well if you don’t like it when you try it on at home because we don’t have a place for you to try it on here you can’t return it”? Pretty much the only thing I didn’t like.</review>< Pictures>

<date>1529723747361<//date><rate>3<//rate><review>Pros:
-Medium amount of inventory of all things.
-Lots of furniture though.
-Customer service was nice. They said hi.
-Good amount of walking space

Neutral:
-I find neither consistent nor amazing finds here.

Cons:
-Prices are kind of expensive which is why I docked two stars. A used yoga mat was $7. I can buy a brand spanking new one for $8 at Walmart!
If that yoga mat was at least $4 and another similar valued item was priced $4, I would have bought both. But instead I opted to buy neither since an individual purchase is not worth it.

Summary: I was walking with a lot of cool things I wanted to buy, but just calculating the cost in my head, I let them all go. This thrift store isn’t bad, but needs to lower their prices a bit.</review>< Pictures>

I wouldn't buy clothes from here; they're pretty pricey, and they don't have dressing rooms or a return/exchange policy. They have some really neat non-clothes items, however.<//Text>

I arrived 10 minutes before closing and was hassled three separate times, in person, and told that they are about to close. I couldn't shop in peace and the final time, five minutes before closing, an older employee came up and asked me to stop shopping and to go to the front with my items so they can close. I was about 30 seconds away from being done looking at the shirts I was flipping through and she asked again to stop looking at items and head to the counter with items. She then proceeded to turn off the lights where I was shopping while my child was in the kids book section. My three year old screamed and cried because she was afraid she was left behind and is afraid of the dark. This experience was not okay. I came to visit from Idaho and cannot believe the horrible "customer service" we received..or lack thereof.<//text>

My house burned down. I have nothing. Im living in a motel with no way to do laundry. I'm disabled and can't drive. I'm also a veteran. I just needed some clothes. They wanted to charge me four cents per dollar to use my credit card. I ask them to hold my stuff until the next day. They said No and quit holding up the line. I lefl, hurt and humiliated. Plus They're probably not up to code due to an overwhelming stench of mold<//review>

<text>I used to really enjoy going here. It was what you'd expect from your average thrift store, it's got mostly usefulness or uninteresting stuff but occasionally you find a diamond in the rough. Now, under new management, the main location appears to be closing down, and Elite Repeat is staying open. They've changed their layout, which makes it feel like there's less stuff in there. And what has earned their 2 stars is that they no longer allow backpacks. It's not unusual for a store to ask you to remove your backpack and put it by the counter while you shop, but this place now says that no backpacks may be allowed in the store at all, be they on your back on by the counter. Since I'm not sure about to leave my backpack outside, and I almost always have it with me, I will not longer be visiting this location.< /text><Pics>None<//Pics><userid>115580843842181644881< /userid></record></dataset><record>

Used them to ball several people out. Pretty cool people. Nice and they are on top of it. Usually takes about 4 hours at most and the person is out. That is really what is most important to me. The faster the better.Thank god for Bail Hotline! (Allpro bail is WHACK AF)<//review>

<text>During a very difficult time I contacted a person that I knew would help me out. Angelica Rodriguez assured me that everything would be taken care of and not to worry. Within minutes she had made arrangements for me and took care of everything. She definitely stopped what she was doing to help me and it’s very appreciated. She treats customers as if they were family and that’s what will make me use Bail Hotline again if needed.< /text></record></dataset><record>

<Text>I was recommended to bail hotline by a good friend of mine, and as it turned out it was the best customer service experience I’ve ever had from any other bail agency. I was assisted with the best help possible by Angelica Rodrigues, she had great work ethic and was very reliable in assuring I was going to get the best service any customer should experience. 10/10 would recommend to any customer!<//Text>< Pictures>

Hands down, Lylyan was the BEST help I could have possibly experienced at a company like this. Such a bright individual. I felt comfortable and knew my situation would be taken care of. If you’re thinking about heading over, make sure to check out Lylyan!!</review>

< Review>
They are very fast about getting a person released from custody, but very horrible with communication within each other in office .. every employee telling you a different story and the visalia office is open randomly. when the employees tell you they’re there but office is completely closed. Came in to make a payment but office was closed and had to leave.. by noon I had financial services harassing me saying I never attempted to come in.

And most importantly someone within the company changed the money amount I owed because of their own personal feelings about me. Thank god for recorded calls or else the situation would have never been fixed.

This business is very MISLEADING!!
They’re helpful in the beginning because they want your money and careless because they already have hooked</Review>

We didn’t know what to do or who to call. We googled some companies so we could bail our son out and decided to go with BHBB and it had to have been the best decision we ever made. Our bail bond agend (Angelica) helped us thru the whole process. She was very calm and reassuring which helped us a lot because she had good vibes. Hopefully you won’t have to go thru the nightmare of having your loved one thrown in jail but if you do and you happen to be close to Visalia, I highly suggest you contact BHBB and ask for Angelica.

this is simply one chef's opinion, however hats off to Pat and her group of workers. In a international wherein provider is dwindling and meals isn't any more than way to a financial give up, Pat has saved it because it used to be. The personnel care. they have amusing. They treated us with notable smiles and joy. Pat works the room. She is everywhere insuring your meal is spot on. I can be coming right here each danger i get when i'm inside the metropolis.<//review>

<Response>None<//Response><Review>What an amazing find in San Francisco. My business companion and I stumbled upon this place for breakfast. The only eggs and chorizo were great as was the homemade bread. If I had to offer on critique, it would be the home fries. They were very "wet;" I prefer mine crispy. However, I will definitely be back this trip.<//Review></record>

< Review>
We came here early on a Sunday morning and already the parking situation was a nightmare.  Parking is just hard to come by in DTLA.  Luckily, though, the restaurant itself wasn't busy and it didn't fill up completely for a while.  You grab a table first, then order what you want at the counter and pay.  They bring the order to your table but you have to get up to the service station to get things like cream and sugar.

We ordered a pot of Earl Grey Cream.  They use a bottom dispensing tea infuser, which was cool.  You just place the infuser on top of your cup and it drains out into your cup.  The Earl Grey Cream was fantastic, one of the best loose leaf teas I've ever had.

Their Chashu Hash Skillet was excellent but heavy on the sauce, so I do highly recommend getting the white rice.  Even then, there was just so much that I had to take half of it home just because there wasn't even rice to eat it with that much sauce.  I wasn't a fan of the potatoes.  They tasted a little stale, which was even worse as leftovers.

I was super disappointed in the Lucky Ducky.  It was way too dry.  Honestly, I had yet to have anyone do duck the right away, except for the Chinese.  Especially when it's roasted BBQ or Peking duck, you gotta go Chinese or Sam Woo BBQ.

My sister-in-law got the pancakes.  They were huge and even though she finished the whole thing, she wasn't impressed with them.  Oh, well.  Service was spot on.  Our server kept coming back to check on us.  Overall, great place.</Review>

Absolutely LOVE this place. It is tiny in size but huge in flavor!!! We've tried the regular Texas style fried chicken and waffles and the Cajun style fried chicken and waffles and both are great, but my favorite is definitely the Texas style. The chicken is juicy and full of flavor. The Belgian waffles are served with butter and strawberries and are delicious as well.< /Text>

I visited this place periodically before the outbreak and it breaks my heart that now I'm not able to sit there drink their delicious coffee and just working. It's a very suitable place to bring your laptop and study or work. Friendly atmosphere and friendly staff.< /review>

<Review>Service it great, and great vibe, homey yet modern. The style is kind of like American with Mexican and i feel a bit of Asian undertones. Very delicious pairing of omelet return choice of toast or coffee cake. Recommend when ever in that area or taking train somewhere.</Review></record></dataset><record>

<Review>We woke up and walked on over after I found it on Yelp. I loved the eggs Benedict with their very own Hollandaise sauce. Simply delicious. Along with their home fries, it was a special breakfast dish. And the coffee in their own JiST cafe's coffee LA mug was so fresh and delicious.</Review>< pictures>

<text>Cute little place that's clean, and cozy with friendly staff. We tried the shareable chicken tinga tostadas (just the right amount of spicy), pork belly breakfast, and breakfast burrito (tasty house green salsa) with mint watermelon. Will definitely be back to try other specialties.< /text>< Pictures>

Usually once a month on the first Friday & Saturday the nostalgic, community cherished, homey Chāshū Shūmai Combo from its  Tōkyō  Garden days can be ordered  from their  website.

It must  be preordered and prepaid via credit card. Pick up at an appointed hour.< /review>

<Text>Usually I don't rate fast foods but I'm going to admit it was very good! The dining place was clean and the restrooms too. The staff is okay but could be better. The price food is affordable.< /Text>< Pics>

<text>Looks ordinary, tastes extraordinary.  This small Cafe slash corner bistro is one mighty overachiever.

Coffee is fantastic, they have coffee syrup!

The Superhuge Breakfast Burrito is an excellent value, enough to serve 2 people. Inside are scrambled egg, cheese, black beans, ham, and tater tots. Outside is a fresh, slightly crispy tortilla drenched in a bright and spicy Verde sauce.

Located near little Tokyo.<//text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOdMZXUzm9ijun9i5ReH-UGFTxu_lclVLjl26OD=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNc9rkwAwyAel_-bBTDnA64-HnzIO_wdRvn7mK4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOEizlnVu8KaxhEeKC7thQ5zLhrgpwivRMSRb6E=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPl6bvVpNfyUl3bG_2ZqDFri1enAei06UHdd08I=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics><Response>None<//Response><gmapID>0x80c2c647d2e7919b:0x37c2d4d0488a1c53< /gmapID></record>

I wasn't expecting this , but I'm totally in shock on how AMAZING the food is, I didn't know that pancakes could get this good. Definitely worth the wait, but this is a must.
Tip: when you are eating at this place, just remember to breathe.<//Text>

<review>Cozy modern cafe in Little Tokyo neighborhood. Food is good and comes in good size too. The indoor seating area is small but there's also outdoor area. It's semi self served, meaning you order and pay at the counter, and get your drinks there, but food is brought over to your table. Friendly service.<//review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPlftMSr4PmU4p9YF0w9T0U79TRfGY3M9aBE-62=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP-L_TpckpvI7IZpk-9fBET4INh-_sGqpQTugtx=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPcMw_Cfv5yfESvKX4jSl-B1Y50YqJH3IOd3sSF=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM8giCEKKvlJ4BfyMVvwPc7u010mOl_gxIS9Or4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures>< Response>

My cousin was coming from out of town, landed in LAX and I took him here for a quick breakfast. Had awesome a "flat white" or otherwise known as cappuccino and some fresh biscuits centered with homemade strawberry jam. Awesome flat white! Visit this place if you get the chance.

We went down on a Saturday morning and the place was fairly packed. Ordered the chashu hash skillet with inane eggs to share and a buttermilk pancake to try. Their waffles are a weekend only special. The chashu was more towards the sweet side, I highly recommend adding rice to complement as the dish is too overwhelming by itself.</review>

This was our first stop on our vacation. We went here on 9/2 so it was PACKED with people! I'm not sure it's always this busy or maybe it was just because of the holiday. It is a plus when they open regular hour on Labor Day. The staffs were friendly and helpful. Drinks are flavorful and they have a variety of pastries to choose from.< /Text>

<Review>This is a brunch place in little Tokyo that has indoor and outdoor seating. Seating is first come first serve and you order at the front. We had the chashu hash, omurice, and salad. The chashu hash was probably the best thing but very oily and the omurice was actually really disappointing but it might be because I don't really associate bacon with fried rice.<//Review>< Pics>

Amazing first time to this cafe. Was recommended by a friend and I usually eat in the area but have never noticed this small shop. This area can be difficult to find parking, there is meter street parking in front and several paid parking structures in the area. The cafe currently closes at 2pm, so most of your food ventures will have to be within a brunch time frame, but I would definitely put this as a priority location to eat if your in the area. I ordered the Char Shu Hash Skillet, the portion is perfect for two and you will definitely not have any leftovers. The meat is marinated in a delicious sauce and the meat is very tender, served on a skillet with potatoes, two poached eggs on top, and a bowl of white rice. It's definitely not a light breakfast, but a must try!!</Text>

<name>Lori Powell</name><Review>Great little breakfast dinner by little Tokyo.  It's on the outskirts of little Tokyo so not a lot of foot traffic here usually.  Ordered the pork belly, pancake and burritos.  A lot of people think the pork belly is too sweet but I think it's perfect to my liking. Service is great and you can bring your dog here as well.</Review>< rating>

After a long hike at Runyon we came here for a little boost. Cream latte, cold brew and almond milk latte- Everything was delicious and great customer service! Although parking might be a little limited, the coffee is worth it. Definitely coming back!< /review>

Just to get the jist of it all, super trendy spot with great location down the street from little Tokyo , walking distance plenty of electric scooters to get around. Don’t walk in with coffee from another establishment I did that and they politely asked me to get rid of it so I drank it and was high off caffeine lol. But super good spot the pancakes are fire as well. Check me out on YouTube - IfAndyCantHelpYou<//Text>

Anime expo Sunday, to lazy to walk far, I yelped this place which had food reviews.

Located in little Tokyo, the entrance looks like a small shop, essentially it must have been at one point. Really right inside where you order but they have a cute wooden deck outside. Not the best tables, a little wobbly but so what.
Ordered the huge breakfast burrito and strawberry shortcake pancakes, iced coffee and mimosas. $44. Feed 3 people.
We still weren't able to finish the pancakes.

They were soo fluffy and delicious. The prefect sweetness. Fresh strawberries and whipped cream on the top.

The burrito was literally gigantic! Nothing special, anyone can make it at home but it was good.
Service was ok, it's like a pay first, grab a number, sit down and eat kinda place.
Get up get your own water and sauces etc.. the mimosa was good and worth $9, served in a small mason jar instead of a weenie champagne glass lol.

If I'm ever in the area I'd eat here again.

I ordered the vanilla bean latte with a marshmallow(titanic). The marshmallow alone made the latte way more expensive than it should be. The marshmallow is great for pictures but it doesn't really add much to the latte if anything it gives you less coffee to drink. The vanilla bean latte OHMYGOD so good!! It wasn't too sweet but still gave the latte a spark of flavor. You can see that they use actual vanilla bean bc black dots are spotted throughout the cup. The coffee is on the expensive side but definitely worth it!< /Text>

Order the right thing!  Food was good but basic for the price.  That being said I was just in off a flight and ordered the first thing I saw on the menu.  Other plates looked far more tasty than what I ordered.<//text>

<Review>Waiters were very, very nice and checked up on us even though we ate outside.

Here’s how it works: you seat yourself anywhere you want, inside or outside, and then go to the front desk to order and pay.

The food seemed a little expensive compared to what we were used to but it was very good. We got the burrito and pancakes. The pancakes were super fluffy and round, and the butter was sweet.

Very good. Would go again.<//Review>< pics>

<Text>Amazing food, especially the Pancakes! They use superior ingredients and make the food with care. Highly recommended of you want a fulfilling breakfast or brunch. The Chashu Hash is also awesome and it is a house recipe.</Text>< Pics>

<Review>I stay at the Hilton downtown whenever I visit LA for work and Cafe JiST is my go to spot. Easy walk from the hotel, quick counter service, and a unique blend of Asian American and traditional American comfort food that always hits the spot for me and gets me ready for the day. Outdoor seating a plus.<//Review><name>Thomas G<//name>< Resp>

Amazing breakfast. I am so glad I stumbled into this great joint walking around Little Tokyo. I had the chashu pork hash. Tender chunks of pork. Crispy potatoes. Pork juices. Make sure to get the rice side to sop juices. Such friendly warm service. I wish I lived in LA so I could brunch here every weekend. If I'm ever back in LA - I'll be there.< /review>

Small and quaint cafe that is located on the edge of Little Tokyo. What it lacks in size, definitely makes up for in creative dishes and amazing tea!< /text>

Obsessed with this cafe now!! Even though it’s a small place, there was still seating available. I loved my meal and had plenty to take home too! I would highly recommend the chashu hash skillet. It was so tasty! The flavors were rich and decadent, but it also was so simple.</Review>

It's a great cafe in little Tokyo.  Bulgogi sandwich and Avacado toast are A-Must try on the list. Their drink is also good. I had a brown sugar latte w/ boba, their boba is chewier than other boba shops which I really love it. Clean and relaxing cafe with good wifi connection. Definitely coming back.</review>

Service was great, food came out relatively fast and them tater tots were so good. The best dishes in my opinion were the Tokyo tater tots (melted cheese, sliced rib eye, roasted red pepper aioli & 2 sunny side up eggs) and the chashu skillet. More on the expensive side but if budget isn't an issue then definitely check this place out! Also, park at the Aiso parking garage; it only cost us $2.<//text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><text>Best breakfast/ brunch place. It's breakfast dishes with a Japanese twist. I've been coming here for years and it's definitely one of my favorites. Can't go wrong with the pancakes, which VERY filling. Portions in general are quite hefty so you get a good meal for what you pay.
There's indoor and outdoor seating. You order and pay beforehand and have the food brought to you.
While this shop doesn't have parking there's lots of parking structures around the area you can access easily, so shouldn't be an issue if you're driving here.< /text>< Pics>

<Review>My favorite part of this cafe is its decor. The food is great too but I would like to talk about the location itself. In the interior of the cafe, they have really interesting wood designs on the wall. They also placed various plants from planks extending from the wall. It adds a pretty cool vibe.

My second favorite part of the cafe is the area in the back. They have tables set up outside and you are next to a historical theater and several lovely plants. This place is definitely a hidden gem. Go check out the patio area if you decide to eat there.</Review>< time>

<rate>5<//rate><Text>I'm a huge fan of JiST Cafe. As someone who lives in DTLA, this is the go-to Saturday morning brunch spot. The Chashu Hash Skillet is very tasty but also a bit heavy - go for the Porky Omurice (sometimes on the menu, you have to ask really) if you want a lighter alternative.

Parking can be found on the street or for 2 dollars per hour at the garage across the street ( Judge John Aiso Parking Garage) which I think is very worth it for DTLA parking standards.<//Text>< Pics>

<Text>Plate we got was delicious, really enjoyed it. Didn't seem like  a lot of food but with the rice it really kinda made it a complete meal. Place has great service and attentive staff. The only downside tho this is it's kind of a small place so avoiding rush hours might be a good idea.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

Food is great, but portions are far too large. Too many tables left with 2/3 of the three pancake stacks. Seriously, the pancake order is the size of a 3 layer 9" round cake. Always share here! Otherwise, it's a chill brunch spot, good beers and mimosas, Asian fusion cooking like your Korean grandma from LA would make.</Text>

Food here was unique but yummy. I got the French toast that was super decadent, I couldn't finish. My hubby got the tres leche pancakes, they were served on a plate filled with milk. That was different, but they were very good. Sorry no photos this time, but Jist cafe is definitely a must!< /Text>

If you're dining in, you quickly order at the front and wait for your food to be brought to you. Service is pretty fast. We ordered the charsu hash, creme brûlée French toast, and a side of rice. The charsu hash was very impressive. I grew up eating charsu but never thought about having it for brunch! It was prepared so well- plenty of meat, potatoes, and a nicely poached egg! I'm usually not big on French toast, but I gobbled this one down like it was my last meal. Totally recommend this place for Asian food-lovers! The Porky Omurice May look simple and basic, but do not let that fool you!! Definitely comfort food with a major hit of deliciousness. The dish itself was very simple but tasted great, especially with the demi glaze sauce. Eggs were a bit bland and could have used some seasoning but overall excellent dish.</Review>< pics>

Great place if you are crazy hungry, slightly hungover or simply want good food. The staff is nice and inviting and their menu has plenty to choose from. Be aware that the portions aren't for the faint of heart. Once entree can easily feed two people. Given how good the food tends to be, one might feel tempted to kill an entire entree by ones self, but do this at your own risk.
The fresh squeezed orange juice is no joke. You'll spend half the time drinking it and the other half chewing.
All in all, a great place.<//Text>

< Review>
I’ve ordered from JiST literally three times in total. My first time was last year & I ordered the Huge Breakfast burrito. Fast forward to this May of 2019, I decided to try something new & outside of my comfort zone & so I ordered the Pork Belly & then I was suggested to add a side of rice on the side for an extra 2 or 3 dollars making my total about $15 after taxes. When I tasted the dish, I didn’t like how sweet the sauce was which made me glad that I got the rice to balance it out & I also just didn’t like the taste of the pork belly. So, I did what any person would do if they just purchased a meal that 1) spent their hard earned money on. 2) they didn’t like & 3) only took 2 bites out of it — I asked if I could get something else on the menu. The owner, “Caroline”, she’s an Asian woman with purple & brown hair, told me “Sorry we don’t take food back & refund for you not liking the food.” Then after of more exchanges words of me telling her that she couldn’t simply just “keep”’my money for food I barely touched, she allowed me to swap if for the Huge burrito. But there was a catch 22 — when I went to swap the food items, she didn’t do what most restaurants do: refund or take off the old order from the receipt & ring up the new item. Instead, she just took my old food & told me to take my burrito & call it an even exchange?????? My burrito was $10. I paid $15 for the Pork Belly. I told her that she could not simply take someone’s cash & try & justify it as “well we normally don’t even do exchanges so you should be happy”. Then, once I told her that I’d literally inform the state about her & how she’s running her business - she did the correct thing which is charge me for the new item. Now, I shouldn’t have gone back after that but about two weeks passed & I found myself craving a burrito. I ordered the huge burrito & the kitchen only put beans & egg in my burrito — nothing else. I figured they were trying to once again “get even” or be funny because of the previous incident. I called them back & told them the kitchen got my order wrong & Caroline got on the phone & justified them messing up my order by saying since  I “modified it w/ bacon & asked for the potatoes to be on the side, it caused major confusion to the kitchen”. NOT, “ I apologize, I’ll tell the kitchen staff to read carefully & take their time when preparing orders. The kitchen is ran by all Hispanics so I’m not sure if they genuinely struggle with reading but if so, they probably shouldn’t be working where they have to read food orders. She then proceeded to tell me how she can’t service me at her restaurant anymore bc of these two incidents. Her reasons were because in the two times I’ve come, I’ve sent back food & her kitchen messed up my order due to my modifications. This is the first time I’ve heard of something like this & I hope this review brings awareness to the horrible customer service.< /Review>

Chasu skillet 6min soft boil eggs!! Hangover omelette is huge. Cute outdoor section within the Union Center for the Arts. Difficult to find parking (meters), but its in little Tokyo area.  Its nice to stroll around after a heavy meal.  Great for Sunday Brunch!</Text>

Great place for fresh and Harry food. The best shortrib sandwich... giant piece of meet. Have Hangover killer scramble such also has a large piece of shortrib on top. The French toast is an awesome way to get closer to your diabetes goal... incredibly sweet</text>

<review>Bad experience. Small menu, overpriced, tasted off. Chicken and pig scramble was watery. Tomatoes not seared like in pics of the food found here, and bacon fatty not crisp enough. Ingredients did blend well, with marinade of chicken sausage overwhelming everything. Lots of pork in chashu hash skillet but meat has strong gamey smell/taste. $3.50 cup of Stumptown coffee was weak.<//review><resp>None<//resp>< name>

Great neighborhood cafe!  Very good food with a diverse menu (burrito, duck with pancake, braised pork belly, etc.).  Love the coffee cake as well, baked in house and they use banana for the natural sweetness taste and cut down on some of the sugar.< /Review>

<Text>Cute brunch place in Little Tokyo with plenty of outdoor seating. The chashu hash was sweet, rich and flavorful, and the 6 minute egg was cooked perfectly runny--I would definitely order this time and again with a side of rice. Don't forget the pancakes though, they're made with creme fraiche and are so soft and fluffy that even if you wanted to stop eating them...you just can't seem to put your fork down. Give JiST Cafe a try before it blows up, and you end up waiting an hour and a half for some good eats.<//Text><pics>None</pics><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

<Text>A cute little cafe with an amazing menu of wonderful breakfast, brunch, and lunch options. A bit of a Japanese/American fusion thing going on, which is just fantastic. Personal favorites include: the Lucky Ducky, Katsu Sandwich, Chashu Hash Skillet, and Fancy French - and this is just going off of memory.
The staff are all very friendly and the atmosphere is great, with the only thing close to a complaint being the relatively small size of the location, but that also means they don't have to rush too many orders in the kitchen either.</Text>< pics>

Jist is only for lunch and when I arrived on a Sunday about 40 minutes before closing time, the place was pretty empty. They have a few inside seating and a pretty big seating area outside. Their patio is dog friendly.

My friend and I ordered the Chashu Hash Skillet with rice and the French Toast to share. Both were excellent and reasonably priced for the portion. The food came out very quickly as there wasn't that many patrons in the restaurant.

I recommend getting the Chashu Hash with rice. The pork belly is heavenly and cooked perfectly. The flavor is great. The dish itself though is too sweet without having rice to offset it.

If you check in on Yelp, they give you a free cookie. I didn't quite care for the cookie since it's not soft-baked but free is free after all.

Parking can be hard to find. I was able to find free street parking several blocks down after circling a few times. There are a few paid lots in the area too if you don't want to look.</Review>

Since a friend suggested it, I came here for brunch around 1pm on Sunday. The only parking available was on the street, which took a while to find. My friend and I decided to share two dishes so we could try more of their menu. We ordered the Chashu Hash and the Curry Breakfast Enchiladas. The Chashu Hash comes with 2 soft boiled eggs in a very flavorful sauce. I would suggest ordering rice with this dish to soak up all the rice and I think this dish is enough for 2 people to share. The Chashu Hash is very heavy. The Curry Breakfast Enchiladas comes with 3 enchiladas filled with cheese and chicken sausage covered in Japanese style curry and a small salad on the side. The Curry Breakfast Enchiladas is my favorite of the two because it was much lighter but still filling. I probably would come here again to try their other interesting sounding dishes.<//text>

<review>The first time we patronized JiST it was amazing, the chasul bowl was divine and the French toast was deemed the new favorite of French toasts for my friend.
We visited twice afterwards 3 months or so apart and the last time the food was sub-par, it lacked flavor. The short rib sauce didn't say hello to my buds, the potatoes were bland and overall it was a not enjoyable.
I will return to have the chasul again, I will see if this establishment deems my continued patronage.

FYI, this is a great spot to hang out and have some kombucha and chat with friends. Awesome decor and friendly staff.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

<Text>This was my second time eating here. The first time I concluded that the food was sub-par and overly priced. Today I decided to give the establishment a second chance by trying something different off the menu. I ordered the 'Mean Lean Scramble Machine' and I was quite content with the food until I found myself chewing on a piece of plastic wrap which was accidentally cooked into the food. The business is located a block away from where I work. Looks like I will be traveling further for food from now on</Text>< pics>

I'll make this short and sweet, just like me (not the short, just the sweet)

3 Reasons Why Your Hangover Needs JiST

1) Chashu Hash Skillet & Chicken and Pigs
Monster breakfast dishes probably invented by some drunk chef with his buddies after a handle of Jack.  The most umami tasting two dishes you can ever get out of a breakfast that will leave your stomach very satisfied.  The has has a gangster pork belly chashu that will overwhelm your taste buds with two 6-minute eggs...that's 6...not 5...not 7.  Chicken and Pigs is a more simple but delicious dish with sausage, ham, and bacon in a scramble of sorts.

2) Fresh air & Stumptown Coffee
What better spot to go to than an open air patio after a long night of drinking to sit in the sun and let the alcohol bake out of your skin while you cure that hangover with an ice cold Stumptown coffee.

3) Free Cookie with Yelp Check In
I've said it 10 times and lets go ahead and make it 11, I love free stuff.  I wake up in the morning scheming on how I get more of it.  This cookie though...is mother of all cookies, perfectly baked and thin so you don't feel like a fatty.

Get the JiST?!< /Review>

<Text>What We Ordered
- Chashu Hash Skillet
- French Toast
- Super Breakfast Burrito

I would come back JUST for their french toast alone! Melt in your mouth, buttery goodness!! I didn't need the syrup since it was amazing it's own. The Chashu Hash Skillet is good to try once....and only once because after you order it, you feel like your arteries are clogging as you see all your food swimming in fat and oil. :( It was a tad salty and everything started tasting the same after awhile. I tried a piece of my friends Super Breakfast Burrito... it was good but, the best thing about it was the green salsa they put on top!!! SOO GOOD. I should have asked for some with my Chashu... I will be back..for their FRENCH TOAST :)<//Text>< gmapID>

Amazing little café located in Los Angeles that is definitely a hidden gem. They're only open for breakfast, brunch, and lunch, so don't expect to go to JiST for dinner! Hours are from 7-3 on Tuesdays thru Fridays and 8-3 on Saturdays and Sundays. They are closed on Mondays! This small café has a few tables inside the restaurant and a lot more outside next to a museum. They have a variety of fusion dishes, but also specialize in breakfast-y types of food. You order at the front, take a number and seat yourself, and they bring the food to you.

I came with my friends, one of whom has already tried JiST. She recommended the Chashu Hash Skillet and the Porky Omurice, and then I ordered the Crème Fraîche Pancakes as well.

And the dishes were so amazing! I can see why everybody likes the Porky Omurice and the Chashu Hash. Wow - the flavors are so unique, that I feel like if somebody brought it home to me without me knowing where it's from, I would still know it came from JiST. The Porky Omurice came with an egg omelet style, which made the flavors of the rice so tasty! Not salty, and the sauce was just great - a little tangy and just amazing tasting when it's put into your mouth. The rice was also very fresh tasting!

The Chashu Hash - yeah, it is a little oily and there are lots of Chashu fat inside the dish (so unhealthy, but still pretty tasty!), but after breaking open the two six minute eggs and letting the runny yolks run over the hash ... amazing! The potatoes also help keep the dish from being too savory and rich. It is definitely heavy, which is why they ask if you want a side of rice (at an extra cost). I would recommend getting an extra side of rice

And the Crème Fraîche Pancakes - comes with seasonal fruit, whipped cream, and syrup. These pancakes were the FLUFFIEST pancakes I have ever tasted. No joke, I probably could have eaten them without syrup. The dish has three pancakes, and for us, it came with apples. The syrup added extra sweetness to the dish. The whipped cream melted quickly, and since it was only on the top pancake ... the other two didn't have that whipped cream taste. But no need because it was so good!

VERY satisfied with the dining experience. The staff was friendly, and they did have high chairs for my friend's baby! They serve alcohol, as well. As for parking - well, you can find street parking or if you're lucky enough, get one of the metered parkings in front (there's just four). Or you can pay for parking at the lot right next door for $7. Food prices are decent. Around $9-$13. Definitely will be coming back!

Don't forget to check-in to get a free cookie! The chocolate chip cookie was pretty tasty! :D< /Text>

(Translated by Google) We recommend that you go to the nearby accommodations once in a while. The staff speak very comfortably like a family and the food tastes great! Try 'Chash Dash Skilllet'. (If you have eaten too much oil, it is recommended to eat something else)

(Original)
근처에 숙소이신 분들은 한번씩 가보는걸 추천합니다. 직원들이 아주 가족처럼 편하게 말 걸어 주시고 음식의 맛도 훌륭합니다! ‘차슈 대시 스킬렛’ 먹어보시길. (기름진거 너무 많이 드셨다면 다른거 드시길 추천)< /text>

<Date>1568071089515< /Date><Rate>3< /Rate><Review>(Translated by Google) On the Internet, it is a popular Tokyo breakfast restaurant, and the Japanese is open to the Japanese (but I saw a Japanese employee on the same day). Signature Department Chashu Hash Skillet, Zhongduan must have a meal 👉 Cha Department Chashu Hash Skillet? It can be understood that the meat is stewed with potato mash.
Ok! Roast meat (forked pork?) is a good taste, although it can be fattened and simmered, with egg yolk, it is really irritating 👍, 咁 嘢 嘢 嘢 嘢 咁 咁 🍚 🍚 🍚 🍚 🍚 🍚 🍚 🍚 🍚 🍚 🍚 🍚 🍚 🍚 🍚 🍚 🍚 🍚 🍚 🍚 🍚 🍚 🍚
In fact, a real department is absolutely good ok! However, the breakfast restaurant is very generous and really different, but the channel is really a brunch shop, because it only opens to two points. I have to choose, only the morning morning, the restaurant, "heavy taste", 嘢 😆
👉 The amount is a lot, the restaurant is half, and the other half is packaged for dinner.

(Original)
網上話呢間係小東京嘅人氣早餐店， 仲話係日本人開嘅（ 但我當日完全見唔到有日本員工 🤐）。招牌係 Chashu Hash Skillet ， 仲話一定要配飯 👉 乜嘢係 Chashu Hash Skillet？ 可以理解係燒肉燉馬鈴薯囉。
Ok！ 燒肉（叉燒？）係好味嘅，雖然可以再肥啲 😆， 配上蛋汁， 真係惹味 👍， 咁漏嘅嘢，咁就梗係要配埋飯喇 🍚。
其實呢個真係絕對係好 ok 嘅！ 不過早餐食啲咁heavy嘅嘢又真係比較詭異， 但佢真係一間早午餐店，因為只係開到兩點。 冇得選擇， 唯有晨早流流食啲咁 "重口味" 嘅嘢 😆
👉 份量都好多㗎，食咗一半，打包另一半晚餐食。<//Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMe-2UHmI59_Ul8rsmOHy4uREJFbAGWt-GW8XT_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures><Response>None< /Response>< GmapID>

(Translated by Google) It's cheap and delicious. It's close to Japanese food, but I also got the feel of Korean food.

싸고 맛있습니다. 일본음식에 가깝긴 하지만, 한국 음식의 느낌도 받았습니다.</Text>

I saw people of all races and ethnicities treating each other with kindness and respect. The same with staff, who knew all the members names.
I was treated with kindness and respect too.</Text>

<review>Course is in great condition. Played after heavy rains and can say the course drains really well. The greens are fast and have very subtle breaks that will make you think and walking off shaking your head

The staff is simply amazing. You can tell they really enjoy their work and are there to ensure members and guest have a great time.< /review><Resp>None< /Resp></record>

We just had our daughters 18th birthday party here and it was amazing! The whole club is very beautiful and well maintained. The staff, from Melissa in banquet sales to Dylan and all the servers that night went Over and beyond what we expected. Would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for an event place.< /Text>

My family is part of a very small percentage of the African American demographic in our city.  Unfortunately, we have experienced racism, bullying and discriminatory behaviors within the the schools. It's one thing to try to justify in one’s mind the ignorant behavior of children but when the adults begin to perpetrate the same behaviors I'm at a loss.

Tonight the San Gabriel Country Club hosted a basketball banquet where my 10th grade daughter would be recognized. Her father, driving in from out of town and spending hours in traffic, decided that it would be more important for him to be on time for his daughter's event than to stop to change his clothing. He was wearing nice Bermuda shorts and a collared plaid, long sleeved shirt. We joked, saying he looked like he stepped off of the country club's golf course. Once we were seated and engaged in conversation with the parents of our daughter's peers, a man approached him and asked him to leave the club for violating the dress code by wearing shorts. We politely refused, trying to make light of the embarrassing situation, and promised he wouldn't get up from table where his calves were completely hidden by the table cloth. Despite our attempt to remain discreet the man persisted while other parents stared and whispered.  That same man, who I believe to be the banquet manager, went on to speak to board members of the school that were in attendance as well as the only African American coach. After several agonizing moments of stares, the coach finally approached my ex husband and told him, in the presence of the other parents at the table including my daughter, “the banquet manager says that they will not begin the event until he leaves".  Feeling shamed and humiliated but not wanting to cause a scene my ex husband left. He is a 6'5" man, weighing 280lbs. He tried to find a store to purchase pants and make it back to the banquet but the local stores did not carry his size and he missed our daughter’s recognition.

What kind of society are we that allows an entity with silly rules prevent us from supporting our children??? If ever there was an exception to be made it would have been this instance. We received NO SUPPORT from school officials, coaches or other parents.

The most ironic and maddening part of this story is that once we got home, not knowing whether to cry or scream, we looked up the Country Club's dress code which states "Denim and T-shirts are NOT permitted on San Gabriel Country Club premises at any time. It is the responsibility of the member to notify all guests of this dress code policy." NO PLACE on their website does it mention shorts of any kind. The invitation we received from the school failed to mention it as well.

SHAME ON YOU San Gabriel Country Club. My advise to you in a single word is...EVOLVE!!!!<//Review>

<Text>This is a private club so unless you are invited you will never be able to experience what being a member at a top notch country club is all about.  The course has always been one of the best maintained courses in Southern California.  The course is relatively flat but extremely challenging yet playable.  I love the greens and the traps are among the best.  The service levels and food are among the best anywhere.  Luis, has managed the men's locker room for years and is hands down the best in the business.  The caddies are also among the best in the business.  San Gabriel Country Club is a bucket list opportunity!

There is a dress code for members, guests and children during banquests and events.  Please go to the webiste for San Gabriel Country Club and read the dress code requirements.

DRESS CODE & ETIQUETTE
Acceptable attire should be conservative and in good taste, respectful of the Club’s
traditions. Members are requested to inform their guests of the club’s standards. The dress
code applies to children as well as adults. (Please note that your particular event may
require a more formal dress code).
Men: Tailored dress slacks and a collared shirt, which is required to be tucked in. Dress
shoes are required.
Women: Similar semi-dress attire such as tailored slacks, skirts (No more than 4” above the
knee) blouses, sweaters, or dresses.
The following is not permitted at any time:
T-Shirts
Shorts, Cargo Shorts, or Cargo Pants
Camouflage Pants
Sports Jerseys or Clothing with large printed phrases or slogans
Flip Flops, sandals, or beach-type sandals
Caps or visors are not permitted in the Clubhouse
The club reserves the right to refuse service to anyone who is not attired in a manner
which reflects the formal nature of the club and its membership. It is the responsibility of
the sponsoring member or host to notify each guest of the Club’s dress standards.< /Text><pics>None<//pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmapID>

Everything there is fresh and delicious and the employees are so nice!  They filled a last minute order for me and did a fabulous job.  Don't go there if you are on a diet!  It's impossible to not buy something. Had to add cookies to my order :)</text>

The nice guy who helped us put up with a bunch of special requests as far as wrapping and boxing up our order goes, and even split a pastry down the middle and re-wrapped it for us in halves without even being asked-all so my mother could pack it to fly cross country with it easier. The staff was very patient and helpful. The cookies are really fantastic too!</text>

<username>L. Martinez<//username><Text>Never come here for any service relating to automobiles.  I had them mount a new $1000 set of 20" Dunlop tires on my new wheels for my Audi and they wrecked my tire beads causing the tires to go flat almost daily.  When I picked up the car there were paint chips and gouges above the wheel wells of my car and one of my side skirts was smashed in from the floor jacks they used.  These guys don't even have lifts.  When I brought these issues to their attention they just walked away.  I talked to the guy behind the counter and he just stared at me without a response.  The tires eventually wore on the sidewalls because they kept going flat faster and faster.  One finally blew out on the freeway leaving me stranded.  Stay away from these "fake it till you make it" clowns.  Apparently they can't even properly do something as simple as an oil change.</Text><userid>107835213336253416215< /userid><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOg_FS94GAXf5oDMExgn-j0j8lTipxOe-xT0n1Q=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN5bCKvIgnALcqzNSNGdp23llTdRyamT5ZBODj3=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics>< gmapID>

This was our fist experience in buying rims and tires. We knew what style of rims we were looking for but had no clue what type of tires we would need that would look nice but still offered a smooth ride. Ibrahim was very experienced and knowledgeable. I would highly recommend him and the staff at West Coast. We will definitely be returning customers.</text>

Used a Groupon deal for an oil change. Price was okay. Took longer than expected but it wasn't the issue. Got home and noticed oil splatter on my car. All over the front bumper, some on the hood and over by the drive side wheel, there was oil streaks. I wish i took more pics but I wiped it off so it wouldn't damage the paint but decided to pop the hood open and noticed oil spills everywhere. They tried wiping it up but it's kind of hard to not notice spilt oil over a dirty engine cover. Definitely won't be going back again.<//text>

West Coast was awesome! Mark, the manager, really went out of his way to take care of me and give me a good deal on a set of tires! I highly recommend this and I’ll definitely be back with all of my car’s mechanical needs. Thanks Mark for making sure I got what I needed!< /review>

<Text>I just want to say to Abraham, Lorena and the team that when it comes to conducting customer service y’all provided me with excellent service and I would greatly recommend west coast because west coast tires provides the service that the customer is wanting.
Employees are on point when it comes to getting the job done. Thank you again to West Coast Tires. And I will differently be coming again when my car ever needs service again. 🙂<//Text>< pictures>

<review>I got a flat with a bent rim 100s of miles from home. It was late Saturday night and I was stuck overnight searching for a place open on a Sunday. I went to 4 other places looking for help with the rim and no one would/could help. I almost never write reviews, but I want to sing praise for West Coast Tires. The people were so kind, so helpful, so efficient. I'm not local to Fresno, but if I were, I would absolutely go there first for tire/wheel help in the future. Thank you West Coast tire for your help!< /review><Pics>None</Pics><response>None< /response><gmapID>0x80946604a3a515bf:0xc63a3961aa080619< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

They have a really good Groupon for $39.99 for synthetic oil change, does not include disposal or filter, but it was only an extra $6. Wait was a little long but they were pretty busy for a Saturday morning. I walked to Costco across the street and got some wiper blades and they were kind enough to install them for me. Great place for a oil change, I'll definitely be back.<//Text>

You don't get what you pay for, Paid for oil change and Alignment  and after waiting 5 hours, when receiving my car back, i find out they didn't change even 1 tire, right in the spot, lucky me i noticed it and told them, i have a new car, that was its first oil change ever, now that i just made the second oil change in its lifetime found out they didn't even change the oil and oil filter, my car still had  the original filter from factory, and the oil looked  like old, really old, engine  oil  for a car that i bought with 0 Miles should be impossible to burn  like that just after the miles recommend by the car company, stay away from this shop if you want to take good care of your car ,  shady business,  this is not right,  you are all warned...hope this review helps someone.< /review>

Such an improvement from the previous owner! The changes made are apparent in sales, car presentation and care, as well as the overall appearance of the dealership. Such an incredible transformation!

The owners treat you like family and handle all business with utmost professionalism. I will be purchasing my next vehicle here. Such a comfortable and smooth process. I appreciate all you guys do! Thank you for everything</Text>

The worse place you can possibly ever go to, customer service is garbage like them!! I wouldn’t ever go back to this place I paid $400 in January for my front brakes, front rotors, and a wheel  alignment  And 6 months later my rotors go out the white guy with all the tattoos on his arm says my rotors are cracked and they are covered under warranty but I still have to pay $110 for labor when I took it somewhere else the shop told me they aren’t even cracked and I took my old ones back and took new ones from them this place is garbage I’d never recommend them to anyone!!< /text><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

< review>
I am so upset with my services from this place. I came in and told them that I needed to replace the two BACK breakpads for my car. And, they replaced the front ones istead! Now instead of a simple breakpad fix I have to replace the pads and the roaters for the back of my car!!!! They even had the nerve to ask me how do I know the back breaks need to be replaced..... my back breaks were at 20%!!!! My front breaks were perfectly fine! Not only that but it took them 3 hours just to replace TWO pads!!! And they didnt even do what i asked them to do. What a waste of my time and money. I paid them to only mess up my car! I WOULD NOT RECOMEND THIS PLACE TO ANYONE!<//review>

<Review>What a joke, cheap prices, but you get cheap parts installed. Bought a 2010 Mercedes 300 from them, yeah they try to fix it. By putting super glue on it (broken wire harness connectors to ignition coil). Check engines came on as soon as we left the freaking lot and keeps coming back on.  Took it to them twice, same damn thing every time.

No, I don't expect perfection from a use car, but c'mon, check engine as soon as we sign the freaking papers and left the lot!!!

Take your money else where, their cars and trucks might look good, but they hide their junk. No good referral and good word of mouth from me, Look else where!< /Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

<rate>1</rate><review>DO NOT TRUST THESE PEOPLE. I purchased a car from them last week in cash and agreed to pay $500 more than I was planning because the salesman, Edgar, told me he would detail the car, switch all four wheels and rims to the ones I wanted, give me an extra key FOB and I could pick the car up the next day even though I wouldn't have the full amount for five more days. The next day, I was told I could not pick the car up until I had the full amount (which I understood even though he told me different initially). When I went to pick up the car I was informed they did not switch the wheels due to a "safety hazard" and I would not receive an extra FOB because they "didn't have any". The absolute cherry on top was the quarter tank of gas in the car and the dust and grease covering every surface even after the "detail". When I questioned the owner about all the "misinformation" I was given he responded with "You're still getting a good deal" as if that made everything better. So yes, I got a good deal on a car, but I had to deal with crooks and liars to do so. Just be aware that these people WILL lie to your face just to make the sale and not show any remorse whatsoever when they don't deliver on their word.</review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

Do not trust these people whatsoever. They get scrap junk from junkyards and put them on newer trucks that have been damaged... slap a lift kit with rims on it and call it a" certified pre-owned" not to mention 98% of their staff is stoned and high on something.. buyers beware and make sure you do a thorough Carfax!!!!!</text>

< Review>
Quality of the car was not good.  1 month after having the car, needed 2  new tires and contacted them about the warped rotors.  They said they were not covered.   Then whatever was used to cover the flaws in the paint wore off after a few washes.  So in the first 2 months of having the car, i spent 700 more dollars on repairs.  So far.....very disappointed<//Review>

Con artists is an understatement when referring to these guys. Grimmest of them all. I test drove a civic with them was content cause it drove well, asked all the basic questions about the car, like last oil change, transmission flush, etc.. Guy said they keep all vehicles up to date on everything so I gave him the benefit of doubt. So first off after I made my down payment. then He tells me it still needs to be smogged (which they did illegally at their shop according to the mechanics that checked it out)Took it by a mechanic shop to get inspection after I made my purchase only to find out the oil pan bolt was stripped, oil was black as asphalt, tpms module had a malfunction, and not only that the tail light was out! Which is totally against the law for them to sell it to me like that. Took it back to them and had them fix that or I was going to sue them. . I can go on and on about these guys but I believe I've said enough to deter you from buying from them. Avoid these guys take your money else where.</text>

This place is a joke for auto sales. My girlfriend bought a truck here. First of all we caught the salesman in a lie about the lift kit on it. He said they did it but when we started the paperwork he didn't have the paperwork on the lift and he said the previous owner did it. They then charged us $100 more than what they said the dmv registration would cost when we picked up the plates. The truck got a 98% rating. The oil sensor went out a month after having it. They replaced it after giving me my girlfriend attitude about it. Maybe a week and a half later the stabilitrack service light comes on and traction control and the check engine light is blinking. We took it to our trusted mechanic and he said there is no pressure in cylinder one. The salesmen are shady and rude and they sell bad products. Oh and when it was towed the tow truck driver said he has town multiple vehicles that were bought here. Stay away, don't buy here. Go to a trusted dealer or carmax. This place is pathetic and a poor excuse of a car dealership.< /text>

<Review>My 5 star rating is for Anna. Anna is a rock star for this company. She went the extra mile for me in every aspect of my situation.  While my PCP didn’t allow me to use Nationwide and I’m visibly upset over this,,,,Anna was so helpful, courteous, steadfast in pursuing help for me in every way. I hope Nationwide recognizes the value Anna brings to this company. Thank you, Anna, for caring about your clients and putting us first.  Norma Miller<//Review>< Gmap_id>

<Rating>5< /Rating><text>I wanted to highlight all the employees at Nationwide Medical, Inc., for their unwavering commitment to our patients.  2020 has been an incredibly challenging year and as an essential healthcare organization we have depended on our people in ways we would have never imagined, and our employees have met every obstacle with sincere determination, dedication, and a level of compassion that makes me so proud to work with them.  Very grateful to have people that truly care about what they do and the impact they make.  Wishing all a happy and healthy 2021!</text>< pics>

<review>Was not having a good experience with these folks until I was able to speak with Susan. She was kind, professional, listened to my concerns, and kept her agreement about calling me back. She researched my account, explained everything clearly and restored my confidence. Susan exemplifies the very best in customer service. She is to be commended and in my opinion rewarded for her efforts and professionalism.< /review>< Pics>

Desiree is amazing. She has been such a pleasure to work with. If you ever have any issues at all this is the person you want to connect with. She's worked at the company for over a decade and will go above and beyond to ensure you are getting the care you deserve.</review>

Let me tell you... its not easy 1. to have this medical condition 2. to be able to understand your medical benefits for the services. Nationwide Medical has gone above and beyond every step of the way to ensure that I understand and am compliant (per my ins) with my PAP machine. Desiree has spent a significant amount of time with me on the phone explaining it all to me. I sure do appreciate her patience with me while I asked questions I'm sure she gets 10000 times a day. Thanks Desiree for being so patient with me.< /Text>

Desiree was incredibly helpful and an absolute pleasure to work with! I could tell how passionate she is about helping others and went well above and beyond the call of duty to make me feel like I was a priority. I am very grateful to have dealt with her and feel she definitely deserves a raise!< /Review>

Zoe at nationwide medical is amazing! At the previous company my grandmother was with I had to translate for her every time they called. To my surprise I saw that my grandmother got new supplies with out me having to get a call. She told me that nationwide medical had someone who spoke Spanish  named Zoe call her. I give props to nationwide medical for being so inclusive!</Text>

It is a pleasure to speak with their staff every time they call, they make it so easy for me to get my supplies. It’s nice having them call me every 3 months, all I every have to do is answer their call, and they do the rest. I had some questions today regarding billing and Diana was able to answer them quickly without transferring me even though it is not her department. Overall wonderful company, I would never want to go anywhere else for my CPAP supplies.</text><Rating>5</Rating>< Date>

Spoke with Susan again regarding a billing issue, as always she is such a pleasure to speak with! Seriously so thoughtful and caring about your concerns. Billing issues are not always fun to deal with at all. Wish all billing representatives were like her!</Review>

<text>The Nationwide Medical team is knowledgeable, kind and efficient. Their ability to break down information in regards to CPAP therapy, supplies, billing and insurance benefits is unprecedented. I would strongly recommend this company to anyone and everyone who has sleep apnea. Diana in the patient relations department is especially helpful.< /text>< Resp>

Great customer service - just got off the phone with Vanessa who has been trying to get me comfortable since February. She's been working hard to get a mask to fit me that doesn't irritate my nose or skootch around my face (I'm a very restless sleeper, apparently). I'm confident we'll get "there" eventually!< /text>

I’ve been getting strep throat chronically for the past year. At 67 year old I have never had this issue before. It all started after I got on a CPAP machine. No one at the previous company I was with ever told me how often I should be throwing away my supplies. I wasn’t until I spoke with Diana at Nationwide Medical until she told me that it was the bacteria that grows in the tube! I had been using the same tube since I got the machine a year ago. I got new supplies from Nationwide Medical immediately, and after doing some of my own research she was right. I’ve had this new tube for a month now and plan to throw it away in 2 more months and so far so good, no more strep throat.</Review>

Mandy, was from the start was a very knowledgeable Nationwide employee. Mandy made me feel as if he cared about the items that I needed to receive for my quarterly supply replacements but also took care of several issues that i was having with the current  Mask and  Cushions that were not working properly . I received excellent service. Thank you Mandy.</Review>

Terrible. Called my local medical supply company, was transferred to Nationwide. I select the supplies option, talk to someone, they transfer me to the options again. I chose customer service, talked to someone . They transfer me again and I get a voice mailbox. The next day I put in a supplies request on the very basic website. Get a call from Nationwide a few days later, gave my info and what supplies I need. I work during the day and don't have time to answer a dozen phone calls from these people. I will probably order from a different company.</review>

Hi

My CPAP machine was 20 years old with no humidifier or filter.  I ran into problems and red tape every time I tried to get a new one. Fortunately, a family member recommended Nationwide Medical.  Your representative, Diana Quintanar, listened to my story, asked some relevant questions, and guided me to the correct device.

Nationwide did all the legwork, contacting my doctor and insurance provider.  My new CPAP arrived promptly with supplies.

Finally, my problem is solved.

Thanks for helping me breathe well again.

Desiree has gone above and beyond helping me with my insurance denials. Medicare denied my claims and put me in a nonpayable status and I couldn't get supplies for 2 years. I got in touch with Desiree and she was able to appeal and overturn Medicare's denial. I am so greatful Nationwide has people like her on their staff.

< review>
I am revising my review to 5 stars as my frustration at my previous CPAP equipment supplier was misplaced (my apologies). Communication and service from Nationwide has been excellent, and Jason has been very professional and helpful.   At least my old supplier referred me to your company after they fell off the face of the earth for a few months. But the pandemic has been a crazy time for sure, so I can understand to some extent.

Thank you for a great job and I look forward to continuing to obtain my supplies through your company.  It’s now apparent to me that Nationwide’s staff and especially the management are head and shoulders above Advanced Sleep Med! (and better than all my previous suppliers).

The COO personally addressed my concerns and clarified things.  Appreciate his being so nice despite my previous unfair review.<//review>

<Review>We had the pleasure to be one of Nationwide business partners for the past 3 years, and I am really impressed with their persistence to create sustainable and effective solutions for their patients. And what I really admire about them is their tremendous dedication to their patients and their willingness to go the extra mile to accommodate all the patients' needs and provide all the possible solutions.
I personally worked closely with Sara Cruz, Director of Operations, and I was really amazed with how genuinely she services nationwide patients with pride as well as the professional and the personal growth of her team. it is with confidence to state that you will not find a more customer centric CPAP provider like Nationwide.< /Review><gmapID>0x80e8214c9afbe8af:0xe87b815596049e7b</gmapID><UserId.>100259906796987279490<//UserId.></record></dataset><record>

Knowing they will speak with someone knowledgeable who can answer their questions is even better. Thank you to the staff at Nationwide Medical!<//Text>< userid>

They've been extremely professional and have been very responsive, making my team collectively and individually accountable to meet the goals they set.

Sara Cruz, Sean Martin, Courtney Schiller, and Suzy Deaton are some of the leaders I personally worked with. They've been very passionate with the patient experience and keep looking for ways to make things better; with an eye for fundamental changes on how things are done and for fostering long term productive relationships.</Review>< Pics>

<review>As far as supplies, I am very satisfied with the service received.  I obtain new/replacement supplies for my CPAP around a quarterly basis which allows me to change out and keep everything fresh.

Only complain is the current website, which is very user unfriendly.  I have attempted several times to have my password changed (as required by the site) and for whatever reason, I cannot get a PW change confirmation email.  Also the site is not friendly to inquiries about the account charges.</review>< pics>

Being Told by my doctor that i need to be on CPAP was so nerve racking!. I knew nothing about this except that this was a medical device. For sleeping. Nationwide and their team contacted me to set me up with my equipment and they were so nice! They kept me in loop along the whole process, it was such a breeze. Their staff took their time walking me through all of my goodies that i get to sleep with and answered all of my questions. They touched base with me weekly and it was so reassuring to hear a friendly and supportive voice on the other end of the phone. Thank you so much Nationwide, you and your staff and truly made a difference in my life</Review>

Nationwide Medical has been a great choice for getting my cpap and supplies. Everyone who has helped me through the process has been courteous and very knowledgeable. And I believe this is the reason my transition into cpap use has been so successful. Also, I get the supplies delivered right to my door.  Heidi has been like a personal assistant who is available almost every time I have a question. It’s a fantastic place!<//text>

<Rate>5</Rate><Review>Nationwide Medical truly cares about their patients! First they coordinated with my doctor to get me just the right equipment which was shipped directly to my home. I was very anxious about using a device at night, but they had a respiratory therapist call me for a virtual visit and helped me get started. I love that they call to check in on my therapy. And when I had an issue with my bill they worked closely with my insurance to get it all sorted out. Thank you!< /Review>< gmapID>

<name>H A< /name><Review>The rating you see is accurate. A tube fot my husband’scpap split making it inoperable. They would not send me a new one, even if I paid without insurance as the guy on the phone couldn’t understand. Then he said he would send it and it never arrived because the schedule says it’s not due for 3 months. Funny but it’s been past 3 months and still didn’t arrive. We ordered it from another vendor.  It should be verified if this is an actual company or just a joke. I have called our insurance company to verify.  The 2 rating is generous. Do not use this company. We have been going through cpap.com for the rest of our services. Just send them the doctor’s prescription and they will do the rest.  DO NOT USE NATIONWIDE<//Review>< Date>

The first call I received was a hello you have an order in for the machine. It'll cost blank cost. It was a shock to hear how much I needed to pay and be in this for. After getting in contact with my dr I understood and went with it. I get my machine and mask for the first night and I try to use it. I put it on and watch some videos for a better idea. Apparently I was wearing it too tight. Well I didn't know because I didn't get a follow call to see how I was doing or how anything works. nationwide claims that i will be receiving a call to explain all of this. I had to keep calling them so I could get serviced. I went through 5 masks and that's the only thing they were good for was helping me use different masks. After enough time my pulmonologist and respiratory contacted me and asked how I was doing. I told them horrible because of how I was not getting serviced. They said come in bring your masks and let's see what we can do to help. I should also mention over the phone they mentioned from the sleep study and the machines data they said that a nasal cushion mask would be better for my fit. If Nationwide contacted me with a RT i might have received the correct mask. I show up to my Dr. with the 5 masks and my Dr laughed so hard. Saying "the masks fit but how you have them really tight to get a good seal". Within minutes they go in the back grabbing a fisher and pykal mask and tells me to try the fit on this one. They showed me how to work it and how the machine works and I'm on my way. I've been using this mask for months now and it's fantastic. The other day nationwide calls me for my replacement parts. This is the only other time they have called me outright.this is a company that will call you ask if your address, email and credit card in file is the same and send the supplies. The guy over the phone did not even ask how I was doing he just asked the question above and said fantastic we are sending a shipment. I need to be serviced correctly and know that I am with a reputable organization. Nationwide if you want to contact me and recommend or help me please give me a call. I would be more than happy to speak with you. However please make sure the person on the phone speaks English and does not sound like they are abroad. A major of my inbound calls have been with people that have thick accents and I truly cannot understand them. I am 19 years old and have a fine time hearing and understanding people but I want to resolve my issue. If you want to look me up and give me a call please do. Thank you.
12/1/2020 After speaking with Courtney and reading some of the other reviews it seems lot's of people have similar issues with the service. I believe this is a company that is very big and needs a rework on their customer service side. Once speaking with Courtney she was understanding and allowed me to voice my concerns. She did mention that the holidays and pressure to get everyone the re order of supplies before the holidays come up could have played a factor in why the initial call was so hasty in that he said he was sending my supplies. Courtney mentioned that she will be changing and assigning me a certain representative from the company so I will be contacted from an in house provider not one of their call centers. My question is why would you have an outsourced center. If this problem resolves sooner or later I will be adding one more update to my review. it is a shame that in order to be serviced I had to publish a review like this. this problem of mine does not seem to be the only one if you look down and read a little there is quite a few people that have had similar or identical experiences.  word to the wise please contact and keep in front of them. If you ask for a supervisor do not let them put you on a list, Stay on hold and make sure you speak with them or even better, Courtney is the support manager speak with her EXT 3018!</Review>< username>

Scam. Was told one all in price for equipment and them was automatically enrolled in their program that doubled my cost. Then they filed insurance anyway and still billed me. Complete fraud. I can't believe that they're in business. Avoid completely< /Review>

<text>I have been a customer of Nationwide Medical for my CPAP supplies for three years and have found their service and attention to detail to be much better than my local DME. Plus, I receive everything on my doorstep without having to go into any location. It couldn't easier! Highly recommend.< /text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

<review>I called and emailed them about my billing statements.  Their customers support responded back saying I need to talk to billing.  I left a voicemail and emailed them about all the charges. But they can’t even call me back about all of it. Within two months they charged me over $700 of things that I never received.

It’s a tough time for everyone and they are scamming their patients. I would stay away if possible. There’s a reason why they have negative reviews. It’s better to go somewhere else.

I will be emailing the bbb but we all know nothing will come out of it.

Just better to stay away and avoid them. I reallly hate leaving bad reviews, but it’s true.</review></record></dataset><record>

I am extremely happy with their efficiency and professional care!!  Recently, my sleep doctor recommended I have an Oximetry reading performed.  This is to test the blood-oxygen levels.   Nationwide Medical provided the necessary device very efficiently for the 'over-night' testing.  They even included a pre-paid return label as well as simple to use instructions to use the device correctly.  Words alone can not convey the feelings of confidence and thoroughness
Nationwide provides me all the time.  I can only say that I feel very lucky and fortunate to be in their care.
I'd like to compliment an individual, Lauren McMurtry, who has helped me tremendously on this journey.  I'm very happy with the results and look forward to seeing my 'sleep doctor' next week.< /review></record></dataset><record>

I've spent countless hours on the phone with customer service and while they said they're sending a new machine, they never actually did. They did send new parts, but they don't even fit the machine they sent. They keep charging me for this machine that doesn't work and for parts that don't even fit! Terrible customer service. Terrible to be charged for their mistakes.

Edit: they called me after this review was posted and then sent me a new machine that was promised months ago. We'll see what happens.

< review>
This company's customer service is THE WORST. I have been trying to get a bill resolved for over a year now. Customer service does nothing but give me an attitude and talks down to me. They do not answer my questions.  I had to make multiple calls asking to speak to a supervisor to be told they will call me back, BUT THEY NEVER DO. They would send me supplies even though I asked them to stop because I have so many. This made my bills add up so fast it's insane. I returned all the supplies but the amount taken off the bill does not make sense. I've asked for an itemized invoice and was told their invoicing system is complicated and can not do that. I made every attempt to pay this outstanding invoice but Nationwide makes it very difficult. I am close to getting legal assistance against this company.<//review>

I never choose this Co. They were assigned by the medical facility that conducted my sleeping test. Dishonest customer services, equal dishonest OWNERS .Trying to obtain a return label for the past 2 month and I never got it. They send Items that you don't need it and they charge twice of the regular Retail price than other companies. They playing a game together with insurance Co. and billing Co.
Authorities should be aware of this legal scams, especially on this difficult times.</review>

Nationwide Medical, Inc.  is a scam. The companies billing is incorrect. I have asked for itemized statements for 2 years.  They are charging me good s that I have never received, and I assume were also never sent. I have asked for them to shut off autopay and remove my billing information because of this, and yet they continue with fraudulent charges!  I am taking my business elsewhere and I encourage everyone to do the same.<//text>

Was sent supplies on the 15th of January and received a bill for over $230 on the 20th of February.  I asked to return the supplies due to the cost and was told by Kevin in customer service that I wouldn't have the items removed from my bill because they were shipped over 30 days ago.  When I tried to explain that I received the bill over 30 days since I received the supplies, so how would I know to return the supplies within 30 days, he hung up on me.  I called back and spoke to Max in billing and he told me to send the supplies back and once they verified the supplies were not opened, Nationwide would remove those items from my bill.  Hopefully this gets resolved and I can update my review on a positive note.< /Text>

<Review>This is a ZERO star company. If they weren't the only place that takes both of my insurances (retired military) they would never get my business. By their own words, it took them over 2 weeks to approve and ship the equipment to my home. And then, shipped it to the WRONG address. I am still looking for another source, and as soon as I find one, I will gladly kick them to the curb!!!<//Review>< pictures>

These folks are eager to ship you product and bill you and your insurance.  Funny thing is I never order or wanted the product but a Dr. who I did a sleep study with stuck me in this racket.  Eventually they sent me return labels for the unopened products but they keep sending me bills with compounding late fees.

Would give them a zero star!< /Review>

<review>This company is corrupt. They keep sending supplies that I did not order and charging my insurance despite my multiple requests to NOT send anything without my authorization and to take me off any autoship. All I order from them these days is return shipping labels so I can send the unauthorized supplies back to them. And then I need to follow up because they don't refund the charges. Save yourself a major headache and find a reputable company.< /review><gmap_id>0x80e8214c9afbe8af:0xe87b815596049e7b<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Was taken care of by the best! 🙌🏽 From the moment my Dr said I needed to go on PAP therapy, I had no idea what the process was or what I would even need. But my doctor told me not to worry because the good people at Nationwide Medical would walk me through the process. I didn’t have to go through any hassle to get setup, their super welcoming employees called me to get everything started! I was told how much it would cost out of pocket and that there were payment options available. They even helped me get fitted for a mask to my liking. I also love that I don’t have to contact them whenever I need new supplies because they will automatically ship them to my home directly when I’m due! Thank you Nationwide for always being by my side! 👏🏽<//review>

<user_id>104960196652757667359<//user_id><Review>This company is in the dark ages. It takes weeks to process and recieve an order. Not to mention that they do not tell you that there is a charge for something. You could have picked it up at Amazon . Then it takes weeks to get a return label, so they bill you for the things you have not returned and you then have to wait and fight to have it adjusted. Some employees seem to try, and others are kind on the phone, but overall the entire experience has been a nightmare. Even trying to return everything! They send the UPS label. At any other store, once scanned your refund would be processed. Not here. I am trying desperately to be finishe with them.<//Review><resp>{'time': 1581002717498, 'text': 'Hi Josh,\n\nUnlike an online retailer like Amazon, we process most claims through insurance so the process of approval can take a little longer than buying something online.  Which is beneficial to the consumer because it allows you to use your health insurance, which you pay a premium for, instead of cash.  We cannot control what UPS does or how they process returns but once we receive them at our warehouse, they are processed and scanned quickly so patient accounts and inventory are updated.

<text>I have been an independent service provider to Nationwide Medical for several years and have been extremely impressed by the way they run their family owned business.  Their number one priority is clearly their patients. From the people they hire, to the wide range of products they carry and to their focus on excellent customer service.  I would not hesitate to use them if I was a patient on CPAP or Oxygen.</text>< userid>

<Review>I have been diagnosed with sleep apnea and was advised that I would be contacted by someone from Nationwide for the past week. I have sent an email and called and left voicemessages for someone to contact me and have yet to speak with anyone. I have read the reviews concerning the lack of customer service and what I have experienced...those statements are true.

I got a quick response from their sales rep Greg Nesen when i first contacted them via their online form on Nov 7th.  He called and took down all my information and told me what paperwork he needed.  I sent it all right away and then never heard back.  I emailed for 4 days without a response.  I week after the first email I called, and they said they never received anything.  I then began the process of resubmitting.  I would call almost every day to find out something was always wrong.  A fax wasn't received, or the paperwork was wrong.  They always said they would call me back, and never do.  I would call to find out a different story every-time.  A month later i finally received my CPAP machine, with the wrong accessories.  This place is a clown show.<//Text>

<review>Horrible company... would not even give me an initial appointment for my equipment without having a credit card on file. They then put me on auto pay (after assuring me that would not happen) and auto ship without my permission and it took having the insurance calling them in order to get that stopped. They want to ship unneeded supplies based upon the earliest date the insurance will pay, rather than when they ate needed. They give you a hard time if you only want specific items,  and there is no one who knows their job well enough to tell you what your supplies  will cost.... I could go on, but I have made my point. They just want people who will follow blindly & not ask questions while they pump the insurance for max allowed charges.<//review>< Pictures>

Terrible job! Customer Service consistently gets the orders wrong. The supplies sent are ones I don't use.

<review>Unfortunately I have used Nationwide Medical for a number of years.
I am a frequent visitor to a local UPS office returning CPAP units that are the wrong type, the wrong size and I still haven't discovered how to use a 'chin strap'.  My last chat was with a major supervisor and a few days later when I received a replacement shipment, it was short the required head gear to
receive the nasal unit.

< Review>
Don't count on this company on a holiday weekend!  Providence Tarzana should've received word that this vendor couldn't serve their patients but, due to the lack of communication and follow through, my husband had to find a friend that had an oxygen machine in order to be released to come home.  Otherwise, we would've had to stay for two more nights before Nationwide bothered to call.  And by that time, the order was more than 24 hours since the testing of Blood Oxygen level.  What a gap in health service; life or death stuff people.  Thanks for not calling back when you said you would!  Providence has been notified.<//Review>

SAVE YOURSELF USE ANOTHER COMPANY
Very poor customer services, I’ve called 6 times now.  Three times to get help or guidance in setting up the CPAP machine to no avail and another three to try and return the machine back to them.  I’ve asked twice now for them to simple email me the return information for UPS, so I can post it on the box and drop it of; no email yet day two and waiting.  I’ve called my insurance carry to inform them to stop using them in their network, along with calling my doctors office as well.  I guess I’m just going to have to take the money out of my own pocket and ship it back to them with signature required course.</Text>

<rate>5</rate><Review>We have been using Nationwide Medical for more years than I can recall.  Initially I felt that we were getting too much too often, because nothing had worn out and we got new supplies.  If the folks from Nationwide called, I went over what we had at home and changed the order so we did not receive more than we needed.

Recently when we had our doctor evaulation visit (now that we are both using C-Pap) I discussed this with our local doctor.  He said that he wanted us to change our supplies at the recommended time.  What I discovered is, for our own good we are not to use individual components longer than the recommended time.  We must clean them regularly as suggested (vinegar and water for hoses, etc.), and replace as needed FOR OUR OWN GOOD.  This was a surprise to me - I wanted to save  Medicare money, but supplies really do need to be kept clean and changed when they still appear to be in good condition.  They definitely do have a plan to follow on how long each component should be used.  Now that I understand OUR responsibility I no longer feel they are trying to sell more than we need.  Keep up the good work, Nationwide.  We so appreciate you and your dedication on our behalf.< /Review>< Pics>

<Text>The employees at Nationwide Medical are great, hard working people with even greater hearts! For them to be currently serving over 23,000 patients, they are doing something right and I believe it is their amazing staff!
I have witnessed their employees like Jakki Baker, RT coordinator, go out of their way to get their patients services that they need at impossible times. They truly care about the people they service and do everything in their ability to help.< /Text></record>

<rating>1< /rating><Review>This place does not care about CPAP/BiPAP customers, they only want to get as much money as possible from health insurance companies. When my local BiPAP supply company went out of business, they sold my information to Nationwide Medical Inc. Nationwide Medical Inc. called me to introduce themselves, and asked if I needed any supplies. I told the telephone assistor that I did not need any supplies at that time. He then used scare tactics telling me that "supplies have to be replaced regularly," and talked be into letting Nationwide Medical Inc. supply me with a new air hose. I agreed. A week later I received a box full of what Nationwide Medical Inc. claims is a "year's worth of BiPAP supplies" along with an invoice for nearly $900.00. I called to complain and was told "this is covered by your insurance." That may be the case for some CPAP/BiPAP users, but I had not met my deductible for the year so this would have been an out-of-pocket expense. I returned everything except the air hose I agreed to buy. That cost $54.00 (you can buy an air hose online for about $15.00). Nationwide Medical Inc. continues to call me asking if I need any supplies, even though I have repeatedly told them that I refuse to do business with their company. They still use scare tactics to make you think you have to replace supplies regularly. That is not true. I bought a CPAP/BiPAP cleaning brush kit online for $9.00 and have used the same supplies for over three years now. The only thing I replace are the filters which you can get for minimal cost. This company is an "insurance grab" that charges full manufacturer's suggested retail price for everything. Most of their customers are probably not aware of that. Nationwide Medical Inc. is one of the dishonest companies that keep everyone's health insurance premiums so high.<//Review>< pictures>

<Rate>1< /Rate><review>I have been using this company for 4 years. This place takes 2 weeks to change a pressure setting on a machine or they don't ever. And then if you call to ask why they are rude and act like i caused the problem. The  tech support was gone on vacation for a week.  If i had the money i would sue this company for fraud, and policies and prices seem to change depending on who i talk to. They failed to cancel my acct with them and keeping me on mandatory $200 autopay for 4 months after i requested to send the machine back and they agreed. They charge my insurance  $686 for $50 worth of the wrong randomly sized supplies every few months, then pass me a $200 bill for the remainder. If you deny the supplies they will cal four times a day like a telemarketer to try and change you mind. Ive ended up paying  $2000 for the machine with blue cross blue shield ppo. I could have bought one on my own for half the price. Now i order my own supplies on amazon for $50.</review><pics>None</pics><Response>None<//Response>< gmapID>

I clean and re-use the supplies (mask, tubing, etc) - with proper cleaning, they can go far longer in use than suggested.  This saves me and my insurance company money.  I'll cancel an upcoming delivery and it will show up.  I'll delay it a month, and it will show up.  A delivery can have the wrong supplies, too.  Invoices never show what the insurance has paid -- just what i owe.  So...seventy-five cent plastic tubes probably end up costing $75.

I have been a customer of Nationwide for a long time. My experience at first was a challenge. I was in the process of getting a new CPAC unit while trying to get my old unit working properly. The Nationwide rep tried hard to satisfy me but to no avail. Fast forward I just took possession of a new unit and received good instruction from Nationwide this time around. So far I am happy with the service although still going through an adjustment process with a new style mask. The CEO got directly involved which I appreciated.

They are a major nuisance. I'm going leave these people as fast as I can run. They harass you on the phone, at least every other day. Way to much background noise on their calls, it interferes when trying to understand someone speaking broken English - which appears to be everyone there. I have told them multiple times to quit calling. They ignore these instructions in violation of Federal privacy law.  Don't use them!!!<//text>

These people have got to be a collection of the dumbest bunch of clucks I've ever had the displeasure of dealing with. Constantly shipping the wrong items, call up to correct, representative assures me they get it, and then ship out wrong item again. They are a boiler room operation, and are incapable of working with clients other than grabbing orders. I'm done with them.<//Text>

<username>Michael G</username><Text>I was surprised to see the number of negative reviews because it sounds like a different Nationwide Medical than I have been dealing with for almost ten years now and have had so few problems it's hardly worth mentioning.   When there was a problem they addressed it and corrected it promptly.   I find the customer service friendly and efficient and responsive.  The shipping of supplies is on time and done with no more than a request that I call to confirm that I want the supplies sent.   At that time they also inquire if the CPAP is working properly and if I have any problems or questions. I'm very pleased with Nationwide; much more so than the two other companies I dealt with in the past.< /Text><date>1430756035525<//date><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

I would give them zero stars if it were an option.  One of the worst companies I have ever dealt with in terms of customer care.  I decided on one machine, a totally different one was shipped.  I never asked for any supplies, a box of extra masks and stuff arrived.  No one ever told me the machine was a rental.  I got a different story from each person I had communications with.  Bottom line is that I would never do business with any company having such a low regard for a customer as they appear to have and I will never do business with them again.<//review>

<Name>Skip Mize<//Name><review>Dealing with this company has been a comedy of errors since the very first time I called them.

What a joke!

Now, since I've decided to complain to the guy who owns the company - my wife and I are getting all kinds of outrageous bills.  Even though when I first signed up with them for my C-PAP supplies they never billed me for over a year - they told me they would accept Medicare payments on my behalf to be considered "payment in full".

If they actually believe that either my wife or I is going to pay them ONE CENT, they are sorely mistaken.

I've been on C-PAP therapy for around 10-11 years.  However, just this past year my wife was diagnosed with sleep apnea and she also uses a machine at night.  Since her diagnosis - and her machine - are far different than mine is, they hired a "contract technician/respiratory therapist" to come to our home and set up her machine.  He did everything in his power to break the machine - I had to take it out of his hands - call Nationwide WHILE THE INCOMPETENT technician/therapist was in our home.

What a joke of a company!

A "one star" rating is one star too many.<//review><time>1434478627395</time><gmap_id>0x80e8214c9afbe8af:0xe87b815596049e7b< /gmap_id></record>

<review>Ben Ditzes couldn't have been more helpful!  I had a question about the electronic things in proximity to my machine.  Ben was helpful in completing our set up and professional in his comments.  I really appreciate the time he took with myself and my husband.
Getting my new C-Pap machine has been a struggle due to some kind of audit and approval or signature (I really don't know the cause of it, but I have a folder of notes from calls and re-calls-all very pleasant people, but results were hard to come by).  So when I got the machine I dreaded calling for the technical help we needed, but Ben was so pleasant and helpful that he really turned my opinion of the company around.  Thank you so much!<//review><username>Mary Nelle Connelly< /username>< Response>

About three weeks ago I got a call telling me that a shipment was coming to me. I told them a number of things that I did not need and asked if I could get new headgear. The individual said he wasn't sure it was time for one but would check and get back to me. That was the last thing I heard and have received not supplies. Not happy!<//review>

<Review>This company is totally unresponsive when trying to resolve an issue. The phone calls made to them were not returned as promised within 24 hours ( or ever) and the contact email brought no response at all. I received an automated receipt message but no person has ever contacted me via email or phone. This is not acceptable and I will not be doing business with them in the future.</Review>< Pictures>

They were assigned to me to treat sleep apnea, and have found them to be uncooperative and unresponsive. I am ready to ask my Dr to assign a different medical supplier. They sent me the equip and left me on my own to set it up and use it. Very unhappy.< /text>

<Time>1424194246300</Time><Rate>2</Rate><text>About a year and a half ago, I got my usual 90 supply only this time the air filters were different than before.  They were larger and without the usual removing tab.  It was possible, using an old tab as a guide, to  more or less cut this larger filter  to fit, but it was not as good as the original.

I first thought that it was some sort of a cost cutting measure, but later learned that it was just a shipping error.  Since that time, I have made repeated calls to have the error corrected and, although repeatedly told the error would be rectified, I am still receiving the wrong filter.  Such service is inexcusable.< /text><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None< /resp><gmap_id>0x80e8214c9afbe8af:0xe87b815596049e7b</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I got my Cpap about 6 months ago, and I gathered that Nationwide Medical was who would send replacement supplies periodically. After a couple of weeks, I realized I could not use the mask style I had been given, so I called the woman at the sleep study to inquire about another style. She said to contact Nationwide. When I called, the woman I spoke to brushed my question aside and told me I HAD to see my neurologist and tell her I was very happy with them and happy with my Cpap. I told her I knew I had appointment - just not when. She asked that I find out when and call her back. I called the Dr, found out my appt was 4 1/2 months away, and called her back and told her. I got "That will not do - you have to get in sooner to talk to her about your Cpap machine".
After that, I got at least a call a week- I told them I was NOT going to pester a very busy Neurologist for a non-medical issue. And the calls continued- we just let them go to voicemail. When the appt date came, I was and still am sicker than I've ever been (tests are being run) - and had to cancel that appt. The appt date was 4 weeks ago, and The calls have since increased to daily, now up to 2, even 3 x a day.
My daughter and I share care of her baby (under 1) and I began having to hang up on the calls, as they keep hitting at nap time and waking her- try to get her down again, another call etc. so I've growled "you woke the baby" at least a few times before I hung up. We got a phone with a "block number" feature as our service doesn't offer one - but it still rings once ( and wakes her). It had STILL gone off 2 - 3 x today and I finally called them. Didn't get past the "leave a message" thing but left one telling them never to call again and they did anyway. So I called the California office and left a message that if they ever called again - I'd sue.Worst company to deal with EVER! DO not let anyone assign you to them - they are a NIGHTMARE. Not sure how much of a language barrier there is (Obviously a call center in India) - but that doesn't excuse the callousness of how they deal with people.<//review>< resp>

<Review>Do not do business with this company. The company I used for my CPAP supplies stopped this part of their business and sent my records to Nationwide. A rep from their company called me twice on the same day asking if I needed any supplies. Twice I told them not to send me anything.  A week later I receive a box of supplies from them. I immediately called them and told them I did not order any supplies and for them not to bill my insurance. I was told they would not and they sent me a return label.  I sent the supplies back to them. They billed my insurance and it was paid out of my HSA. I reported the fraud to my insurance company. They called Nationwide and things are supposed to be reversed. We will see.
***UPDATE*** The above happened in January and it is now May 23. Still no credit. After several calls to Nationwide and my insurance company, it was determined that Nationwide was faxing the reversal form to the wrong number. After that got corrected, they faxed the wrong form so I am still waiting for MY money to be put back in MY account.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None< /response><gmap_id>0x80e8214c9afbe8af:0xe87b815596049e7b</gmap_id></record>

<review>A rep called me over a month ago. I thanked him for calling and said I would keep their company in mind should I need supplies. The end of the month I got a handful of CPAP supplies!  NEVER did I authorize him to send me anything and NEVER did I authorize them to bill or contact my insurance company!
Now I have to take the time to contact the insurance company and let them know About this company and that I did NOT authorize anything!  How dare this company try to pull some stunt like this!</review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

<text>This company is contracted  medical solutions in PV az. They I guess they supply pulmonary equipment. They called me didn't identify themselves and asked me if I needed a back brace.I didn't know a back brace is used with a bipap machine,or a oxygen concentrator. I called medical solutions asked why any medical information that my doctor supplied for sleep apnea or oxygen that I need they coud'nt explain why.I was called to pickup my equipment,no home setup I guess. They had my bipap,no oxygen concentrator,they said Dr did not order it. I have there email it tells me they have sleeping supplies and oxygen concentrator. I have know idea how these companies are contracted with Medicare,but I hope to find out.<//text>< Name>

<name>Cynthia Emmons</name><date>1467419359390< /date><rate>1< /rate><text>I would give them ZERO stars.  As a medical professional I would never ever recommend this company.  I have had nothing but problems with this company....sending the wrong supplies, overcharging, blaming me when I called with concerns.  Most recently, 2 days ago there was a message left on my voice mail stating that a shipment of supplies would be sent out in two weeks.  I picked up and listened to this voice mail that was left by "Sylvester" on the evening of June 29th.  I called and spoke with "Debbie" on the 30th and requested that they do not send out any supplies.  She said she would put a hold on any shipments and thanked me for calling in such a "timely" manner.  Today, July 1st, when I got home from lunch out with my husband, there was a package of supplies from "Nationwide Medical" on my front porch.  I called the company with concern.  Was put on hold with the recording saying it would be 6 minutes or less before a customer service rep would be able to help me.  22 minutes and 31 seconds later no one had answered and I dialed the operator and informed her of my delimma.  She said they were extremely short staffed and no one would be able to help me at this time as they were closing soon. She wanted to know why I agreed to have the supplies sent out when I "talked" to "Sylvester" on the 29th.  When I explained I had never talked to him that he left me a voice mail and that I called "Debbie" right away the next day to not send them. The operator then informed me that "Sylvester" had documented that I told him to send out the supplies. I was informed that "she does not know why Debbie did not tell me "the supplies were already sent out the day before less than an hour after the message was left that supplies would be sent out in 2 weeks!  What a mess!  .....and of course they are the wrong supplies.  My insurance has already been billed for something I cannot use.   To replace them with what I need will cost me significant amount of money.  I am not only leaving this review, I will be leaving a review with YELP.  I will be calling the Better Business Bureau,  i will report them for possible fraud to my insurance  company and also to the California Insurance Comissioner.</text>< pics>

<username>Jo Mawma< /username><review>Had to be taken away from my original CPAP supply company who was awesome and placed with Nationwide Medical after affordable healthcare act took effect. Nationwide Medical is horrible! I can never get supplies when needed. Communication is horrible, they never return calls for supply orders, or follow up on supply orders or follow up with supply shipment status. EVery time I need supplies, I have to call them....each and every time, all supplies, even filters are always on at least a six week back order. Now my CPAP water reservoir tank started leaking...guess what, six weeks wait time for the replacement part!!!! And not only for a replacement part, but also CPAP supplies AGAIN!!! Stay far away from this company!!!! One star rating is being over rated. Poorly disappointed! Contact Medicare and let them know you are not happy with Nationwide Medical and they will give you options to be placed with another supply company! Highly disappointed and frustrated!<//review><Time>1420767043757< /Time>< pictures>

Harassing company!! They are always trying to push their supplies on you.Tell them you don’t need it and they start questioning you and still trying to send you supplies, so they can charge you for them.  When I told him I didn’t need anything right now and hung up he proceeded to call me over and over until I answer the phone! I really need a new supplier!</Text>

I selected this company since they are a preferred provider with my insurance company.

So far, I am very dissatisfied with their service and lack of communication. If possible will switch to another provider.< /text>

Cassandra: I had seen her work on Instagram so when I finally decided to do Balayage, I knew I wanted her to do it. I did have to wait a while for an available appointment, as I initially called right when restrictions were lifting in CA & SD and everyone was making appointments. The other part of it is that excellent stylists do get booked up. Let me tell you it was SO worth the wait. To say that she worked a miracle on my ugly pandemic-brown shade of hair would negate the fact she has serious talent and skill. Bonus: she’s super nice and easy to talk to. I was and remain blown away by how beautiful my color turned out and have been getting endless compliments.

The salon and other stylists: The owner has done an amazing job culling top talent because everyone leaving the salon while I was there looked beyond. Not good or great, but runway-ready amazing. The atmosphere is professional, but there’s also a really good, fun, light vibe there. I also really love that the salon has an outside area, because I’m really bad at sitting and doing nothing unless it involves a pool and drink in my hand. Very reasonable prices for the quality.

Bottom line: You’re going to have a great experience and leave as your best self, no matter who you see. But if you want to see Cassandra, book in advance…I already booked my next two appointments before I left.</Review>

I came in with blonde hair and wanted to go a little bit darker. A light to medium brown. He gave me black hair. I am not even joking. It had shades of red and purple too. Then when they were fixing it the other stylist made it seem like I showed him photos that were not accurate to what I wanted. This has been a process getting my hair back. Spent so much money, so much damage to my hair. I am not someone to ever write reviews but I just had to in this case. I have felt so upset ever since.</Text>

<Text>1. Call many times to make first time appointment. Nobody pick up phone.
2. Left messages in social media requesting appointment. Nobody replied.
3. Left message on website either.
4. Finally got an appointment through a friend who was at the salon.
5. Arrived at the appointment and the stylist was not there. Waited for her 15’.
6. When she arrived she said not appointment has been made under my name. 😳 (did not check the salon agenda)
7. She took me in but saying she had a client at 10 am.
After all I just decided to have my roots done.
Left with some tincture over my forehead but she did a fair job.
The overall experience from trying to book an appointment to being there waiting was not the best.</Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

Always friendly service with high quality results. I've been seeing Molly for over a year now for highlights and trimming and she's fantastic. Compared to the NYC salon I previously frequented, Textur provides the same quality service for a fraction of the price. Highly recommend!</Review>

So the first few times I called no one answered. Ok people are busy, I get it but there is no answering machine. I called a different day and was able to get an appointment, however they didn't ask me who I wanted to be styled by and made my appointment with Ashante. This man is their barber, and although his description says "hairstylist" I don't think that should be the case. He was incredibly rough and heavy handed. I left with a sore scalp and a headache. I wanted it layered and the length evened out, as one side was longer than the other. My layers are jagged and the length is still uneven. After he was done styling it, curls were also uneven, he made me pose for a bunch of photos.
Overall it was a very unpleasant experience, I'm unhappy with my haircut and I've never had a similar experience at another salon. We are moving soon so I don't have time to get this fixed.
Bottom line, if you're not looking for a barber, don't make an appointment with Ashante.</text>

Ahsante Is beyond amazing.

I get my hair cut, colored, and styled routinely. Every time I leave I feel assured. I had to come on here today and leave a review being everywhere I go I get a compliment on my hair style and cut. I am referring my stylist/ barber all day. It’s amazing how much our hair changes our appearance and the world around us responds.   Thank you Ahsante.<//text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

I got my sweetheart a gift cert for a color and cut, and this amazing team had her very impressed with the entire experience from start to finish. Thanks for giving 100% and then some to my honey! She described how the stylist worked together as a team - and that really shows you care.</Review>

Nice vibe, complete with the option of  outdoor seating in downtown Carlsbad. More importantly, talented stylists. Everybody's very nice.</Text>

< review>
I had the best experience here! I picked this place because I hate making phone calls and I was able to schedule an appointment online and Im so glad I did because I got probably my favorite haircut I have ever had. Kaite was my stylist and she did a great job! I am super shy so I appreciated how she was friendly but didn’t make me chat too much. I am not very good at communicating what I want, but she totally nailed it! I got a ton of length taken off and she gave me some cute layers to give my hair a little bit of personality. I feel like a new me! I had to wait a little bit for her to finish up with her other client, but it was so worth it! The salon is cute and everyone in there is friendly too! Thanks Katie!<//review>

I’ve had my hair cut by 3 different stylists here and they’ve all been wonderful. Most recently Cassandra cut my hair and she did a great job! Will definitely continue to come back</text>

<Review>I love the way Courtney cuts my curly hair she is the only one I trust with my curls she is the best at what she does. I have been going to her for years. Every time I get my hair cut I don’t worry because she cuts it exactly how I want it. Won’t go anywhere else but here, they are very friendly and the shop is very clean. I just love the atmosphere best salon in Carlsbad!!!< /Review><Rating>5</Rating><pics>None< /pics>< UserId.>

Kelly is my stylist and has been for over 3 years. She is the only person I trust with my hair. She keeps me healthy and helps me achieve results without damaging my hair. I have personally never been happier as a blonde. Every time I leave the salon I am happy, and if I have ever changed my mind in the chair last minute and decided I wanted something different, she goes above and beyond to give me whatever it is that will help me to leave with a smile on my face and feeling confident. Kelly puts so much pride and effort into what she does, and she is just a pleasant person overall. I will honestly never go to another stylist. Highly recommended.<//review>

<rating>5< /rating><text>I just recently moved to Carlsbad and did extensive research on the best place to get my hair done. Not only does Textūr salon have great reviews but it was recommended by other businesses in the Carlsbad area. I personally went to Cassandra a few days ago at Textūr and she exceeded my expectations. I was shocked with the way she transformed my hair while keeping it healthy! I won't go anywhere else now, I've deemed her my new hair girl, specially for my wedding coming up in May.<//text>< Pics>

I’ve been here about 4 times and have always liked the outcome. The overall environment is friendly and hospitable, and they even give you a drink. However, this last session resulted in drastically uneven sideburns, half a beard and a choppy haircut that looked like Supercuts. 😂< /review>

I am amazed with the atmosphere this salon has to offer its clients i came on a vacation with my family and came to this salon, all the hairstylist are friendly,welcoming and professional and clean. This salon is like no other salon I've been to. They have a nice comfortable waiting area a candy section for you to treat yourself or for your kiddos to enjoy candy while they wait you can also have something to drink on their patio while your waiting if your coloring your hair. Ahsantee is hands down the best he is very easy to talk to and made me feel as i was talking to a friend that i had know for years he did an amazing job getting my hair back to life (my hair was a mess after A lot  of coloring bleaching and heat damage my hair was always frizz and always tangling up) he is a miracle worker my hair is so smooth, no frizz AND i could run my fingers through my hair without have to stop because its tangled. My hair looks healthy and I'm extremely happy with the results. The whole time he was doing my hair he was talking to me explaining everything he was doing. He also cut my sons hair and my son said he is awesome and love his new haircut. If you are in the area and looking for a new family hairstylist/barber for your family i would definitely recommend you call and make an appointment with Ahsantee if i could give him 10 stars i would but yelp only allows 5.</review>

< Review>
I saw the amazing reviews and decided to take my car for recertification of dmv smog test. I was greeted right away. Very professional. In about 10-15mins I was on my way home. Will be my go to smog shop from now. Already recommended this shop to my mom and brother since they also have first time recertification coming up. Thank you A&S Smog Check Center!!!< /Review>

<Review>Thanks you Danny for a swift and easy smog check! I previously went to a smog shop with higher ratings, but guess what! Their machine was down! Great thing because I would have never had great conversation or  great service! Thanks again pal! Highly recommended and definitely made a returning client out of me!</Review>< pictures>

Came around 5:30PM on a week night. No wait and the worker was super fast. I was in and out in no time. I didn’t quite a bit of search in the Riverside/Moreno Valley area re: smog checks. This place easily had the best price, as well as reviews to match. Service lived but to the reviews. Easy and a great deal!</text>

<Name>Robert Lozano</Name><Review>This is a Clean and Honest place. You won't find a better deal. Service was fast and at the best price I've found... and trust me, I searched. I searched through Google and Bing, flipped through pages of the Pennysaver and junk mail. I read ads and clipped coupons of places advertising what I believed as fair prices. However, once I called these ads claiming fair deals I was introduced to what we call "hidden charges". They all found ways to add to the advertised price. The final product would be what we call "raping the consumer$".
That was until I called A&S. Their ad had a price that was the same price I would pay for the service. NO HIDDEN OR EXTRA CHARGES! Test this theory pout yourself! They are the only one I found with this straight forward honest service. I was lucky I found theses dudes because I almost went somewhere else and over paid.

I wanted to leave negative reviews on the other locations that are lying and overcharging, but I figured it would be easier to leave a positive review at a place that deserves it. That way I can also recommend that you not waste your time and save your money, and allow A&S smog test center to Pass your smog test.<//Review><gmapID>0x80dca8a8d68c509b:0xf037e3c9f695c76d<//gmapID>< user_id>

<Review>A&S Smog is definitely the bee's knees! My husband and I went first thing Monday morning to get our vehicle smogged. Its a small place but kept well maintained.  We were greeted by Tony, a very pleasant individual and honest. He right away took our vehicle into the garage and started his thing. I filled out one simple paperwork and in about 10 minutes we were done! Unfortunately our vehicle did not pass smog because it "wasn't ready". The amazing Tony explained to us why it did not pass. When replacing an O2 sensor, the vehicle needs to be driven for about 40-80 miles before the vehicle resets itself. Tony advised us to drive about 40 miles then come back. 40 miles later, we return to Tony and he checked with his reader before performing the second test. Sure enough, our vehicle was ready for the test (And to think, other places would have charged up the whoohaa just to do the same thing)... final verdict: PASSED with flying colors! Not only was the price of the smog reasonable, but you will get quality, professional, honest service at A&S Smog. We will definitely be bringing our second vehicle for smog testing to A&S Smog. Thank you so so much for your service!!< /Review>< Gmap_id>

I guess he's doing his job which is to find out if the smog equipment is working as intended to by the manufacturer in the government that approved it. So part of that is he seems to look for problems. But then if there's nothing wrong he won't find anything. But it is a little bit nerve-racking.</review>

<review>I thought I already posted about this place shortly after I went there but it appears I neglected to do so while many of you might read some of my post and they're only five stars that's the only ones I'll feel comfortable posting about any one or two stars three stars are four stars I just don't want to post about I'll let others do that but this place deserve to five star it's a small little shop not a whole lot around it not a lot of dirt and hustling bustling anything like that you just pulled in you get your work done Fair honest price from a fair honest guy and you're out every time I have to have a smog check this is the only place I'll be going to< /review>< Pictures>

<Review>Ive eaten here twice, on my second visit I remembered right away why I hadnt returned sooner ( over a year). While on social media I got an add for thier pulled pork and decided I wanted to try it. I went on Tuesday and of course the pulled pork was only a special on a certain day. I wear contact's and have pretty good eyesight but that doesn't help read the menu. Its literally the smallest writing ive ever seen for a menu making paneras menu look like large font. I couod look past all that if the food was on point. But unfortunately it's not, I dont understand why an order of fried zucchini comes in a family size, and with no ranch to dip it in. I ordered 2 additional ranches assuming id have 4 of the small containers. The two I recieved didnt last long at all. More importantly I and my partner probably ate 1/3 the rest was wasted. I ordered a pastrami sandwich which was the only tasty part of my $25 meal the french roll was very soft and the meat was cooked perfectly. Thats the only reason im giving them 2 stars. Considering how large the zucchini portion was the french frys pprtion that came with my sandwich combo was measly and they were terrible not salted. I wasnt offered any salt or pepper, not even ketchup. Luckily I had some spare packets in my car. Lastly but most disgusting was the fountain drink.  I ordered a sprite but it tasted absolutely flat lemonade made with third world country tap water. This place has a great idea but they seriously need to get it together.  I dont recommend it.  I will never be eating here again or at least anytime soon</Review><name>Francie Base<//name>< Date>

<Text>So I have lived here for almost 4 years and decided to try this place finally.  The traffic is super loud where the drive thru speaker is, so it makes it a bit difficult to order, but I am so glad that I decided to try this place out.  I got the mango habanero salmon with veggies and fried zucchini.  I have tried a lot of fried zucchini because we made it growing up, and this is the first place that made it absolutely perfectly!  It's crunchy and moist on the inside and the breading is perfectly dry and not greasy.  The salmon and veggies were spot on perfection!  My daughter said her grilled cheese sandwich was the best she has ever had.  Definitely returning here to try out more food on their many items to choose from.< /Text>< pictures>

You really root for your local place to be great but this is a basic quality control issue. Not alright for a $15 item.</Review>< Pics>

I have always loved the fresh food and friendly service until today. The gentlemen that answered my phone order was nice and pleasant. The two girls in the background however were down right rude to say the least. The young girl who took over the phone call does not know the meaning of the phrase "customer service" They left the phone on the hook while they argued and complained about my order. The girl talked over me and never apologized for her rudeness and in fact was very condescending. I work close by and order from them often. Quite often these are big orders for our whole staff at work. NEVER AGAIN will I order from this place. It and the employees have gone down hill. Very sad, because like I said I have always loved this place in the past.< /Text>

I've tried this place about 3 times over the years, and every time it is a letdown. For what they charge, the food is mediocre at best. $16 for a lettuce-stuffed, burnt bread sandwich (no side) and a shake is ridiculous. Honestly, go to In-n-out down the road for a decent burger or an actual deli shop for a sandwich if you want something worth the cost.<//Review>

Good deal for the price all my friends enjoyed their meals. Fairly well priced for the quality of their food. But their burgers were pretty tasty. One thing is the atmosphere and the music in the restaurant matched. Very rare a restaurant had a rustic atmosphere with country and folk music.< /Text>

Great tasting food!, We had a carne asada burrito, bacon cheeseburger, regular burger, fries and onion rings. It was all delicious!. Service was as fast as it could be through the drive through, can't wait for all this PLANEDEMIC BS to be over so we can sit and eat inside again.

Great staff, going back tomorrow!...

Highly recommended!.... 👍</text>

<review>Three of us were looking for lunch and found good reviews for Down Home Grill close to where we were.  It is a small place with a lot of take out and shared tables.  They have a good menu with breakfast and lunch choices along with good prices.  You order at the counter, no table service.  We each had something different.  One had Fried Shrimp and Fries and had enough to take some home.  Another had Strawberry Pancakes with Eggs, Bacon and Sausage and was really happy.  I had Chicken Fried Steak and Eggs and was also very happy.  All of us would go back and might even try something different next time.< /review><gmap_id>0x80c3641f79da3fc1:0xdcea9abdc0ecac54<//gmap_id><username>Bill Joyce<//username><response>None<//response>< Rating>

< review>
Very disappointed with their food and customer service. On a busy day, employees were not organized, coursing, and blaming others for their errors. They were arguing back with customers because employees where giving away the wrong order to others. Not only did they give my order away to someone else, but their food was horrible—the fries were unhealthy and not edible. You can taste the fried chicken on their fries. Not only that, but the burnt oil on their fries were horrible. It almost tastes like they only changed the oil once a month. Also, their TBLTA was raw to the point I had to throw it away. Lastly, it took over an hour to get my food. This establishment did not have ice, soda refreshments. With their employees coursing, I would have to say I will never recommend this place to anyone or return. My recommendation to the owner or management is to close and retrain their employees and their cooks.<//review>

Today was my first time trying their food and let me tell you they didn't disappoint. I got the tri tip special which came with mashed potatoes and gravy, corn on the cob and peach cobbler with vanilla ice cream all for $13 which i think is a great deal. Everything was delicious trip tip was well seasoned, tender and juicy. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for good food thats has an authentic home made taste.. Will definitely be visiting again.</Text>

<review>Everything was fine, service was good, prices decent. We just didnt enjoy what we got. Rather bland, but I dont want to knock them completely. The fries are hard and dry, the burger and steak could use more salt and pepper, but like I said, that's just me.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None</Response><GmapID>0x80c3641f79da3fc1:0xdcea9abdc0ecac54<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<rate>1<//rate><review>Rotten food, untrained staff, unsafe handling of food, and more.

I just got off work and decided I wanted to grab some dinner, came here and issues begun at the drive thru instantly.

I ordered a Portobello & Veggie on Ciabatta Sandwich for $8 and they had no idea what I was talking about, literally told me they were reading the menu to find it, gave up looking for it and insisted that I must have meant the Portobello Burger when I definitely did not. Then I ordered a Wild Caught Grilled Salmon that comes with a salad and your choice of Friend Zucchini, Fries, Quinoa or Rice

I chose Rice and then Ranch dressing.

I have no clue what they thought I ordered because then they started asking me what side I wanted and said that the rice was an addition on the side and wanted to know what I said “no” to when the word no or even the sound of the word “no” never left my mouth...

Took 8 minutes of back and forth to explain what I originally ordered and when I finally got it all corrected, they admitted to thinking I ordered the Pineapple & Habanero Salmon which has its own special sides.

Took a very long time to get the food from the window, had to use the drive thru for safety reasons during the Covid pandemic.

Once we got our food, I drove around the corner to park so I could eat while the food was at its hottest.

First off, everything was cold, hard and stiff.

The salmon smelled off, really off, it’s cooked weirdly and they managed to make it look more like chicken than salmon. They also listed this as Wild Caught, when it clearly wasn’t, wild caught salmon will always have a national pink tint too it and farm salmon will be grey, typically dyed pink by the farmers before they send it out to stores. This salmon is white, very white. It was also overcooked and dryer than the sand in this desert.

The rice that came with the salmon definitely isn’t fresh, it was hard, stiff and clumped together into huge blocks. It was either from the refrigerator or it was cooked in the morning then put into a cooling area for hours and never mixed around. Anyone that serves rice at a restaurant knows that you need to keep the rice warm and mixed well after cooking to keep it fluffy and soft. Just from this dish alone I can tell that this restaurant is either ignoring the basics or they simply don’t care to get the proper training, the rotten fish is a huge no no also, i don’t know how anyone could serve this with how awful it smells.

The salad overall was fine, a typical basic salad, really hard to mess up, but then the dressing was like the mucus of an egg, so thick that it held the salad still while I held the container sideways, the dressing also had a terrible after taste that leads me to say that it was likely off as well, just like the salmon (picture was taken at home because I drive home right after seeing how awful the food was so I could start cooking)

The Portobello Burger which wasn’t even what I originally tried to order first off, was completely soaked this a thick mayo tasting Aioli, they had it under and above every single topping which leads me to believe that they put it on after every topping to really drowned this Burger in it. Likely they did that to drowned out the flavor of their Mushroom, it was colder than the food in my refrigerator, looked like someone had flattened it as all the spines underneath and the sides were crushed flat and mushy. The bread was so thick compared to the mushroom and honestly the bread took up 80-90% of the sandwiches size and when you take a bite into this, the bread is all you taste and feel, then you get a small sliver of ice cold vegetables.

They charged me $25 for this, honestly disgusting, they don’t know how to cook in my opinion and I’ve been working in food for years.</review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPOYuQ6ittitufEHGzt3GJGd6EILdzP_GTB-Z8D=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMNGp6cXvTeyIlJWmoq-KLE60abPcGsxoEB9f7m=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMNq-ffHwRV57j-R4WwlsUPfjWQjWjpL6yPhkJI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOUiu3KWlzdKwGVBebwWazAECYSDb8wjs2v3z0w=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPcCubNft6iXcpff3s5R00tLJhslUKA8xSZSbgg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP2cUK8_VniMLXMgyplC63vGhRBzwk1yYVq3r3d=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPVugsYBEEQgwpa2GVl0BR_McYaf_ZQtwfstCnR=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures>< response>

Pick up only because of the pandemic. The meatloaf dinner was very good. The "smoked" chicken turned out to be barbecued chicken, and really pretty dry at that. The staff did seemed to be friendly enough.</text>

Very pleasant drive thru staff. Given the wrong amount . The burger n fries were pack TIGHT in a takeout container n by the time I drive 3 miles home., the fries were soggy. The bun was smashed.
I was not pleased,  especially as it costs so much. $10.74 for 1 burger combo. Not again<//review>

Best food in town period ! Absolutely wonderful staff. Love the atmosphere and the huge table that invites total strangers to converse over a meal. Feels like home.Over time I felt like the chicken tender quality has decreased. Where when I first came they were the size of my hand. 6 GIANT chicken fingers. Now they are a decent size but about half of what they were. They still taste delicious with buffalo sauce or ketchup.< /text>

My wife and I went there yesterday I ordered a plain double cheese burger and fries. My wife ordered the western chicken salad. My burger had everything on it and some sauce that was terrible. The fries were basically raw and soggy I couldn’t eat them. My wife asked what was on the salad the girl said the normal. What is a normal salad? Every place puts different things on their salads. So my wife asked well can you tell me what you put on your normal chicken salad? She was told lettuce, croutons, chicken and olives. What they put on the salad was no croutons black beans ( I guess she thought they were olives) corn and a chipotle sauce. She never said corn, black beans or chipotle sauce. Top it off the total for this junk was $27.41. We came home and threw it in the trash. I will never go back you would think as long as you wait in the drive thru they would get your order right.< /Review>

Food is not consistent. Ordered the buffalo wrap and it was falling apart and dripping everywhere not even able to eat. Next day ordered the Ahi Salad. Came with no dressing the Ahi was rotten and soggy  and the mandarins tasted fermented.  Really disappointed because it's always a hit for miss if it's going to be good. For the price food should always be consistent and good.  Very sloppy...Extremely disappointing.< /Review>

Food was great tasting! Steak sandwich, Club sandwich onion rings and fries.  This was my first visit...during the Stay At Home orders. We chose the drive-thru option. Slightly priced higher but so worth it. There was a wait in line but I do plan on returning.< /Text>

<review>Can't say enough positive about this place.  Even though it has a drive through, it is still one of the highest quality restaurants in the entire High Desert.

Good food. Super nice employees.  And they usually have an IPA or two on tap too.< /review><Time>1547917502910<//Time>< user>

I absolutely love this place. The food is always so fresh and I like that there is a drive-thru option. Expect to wait a little while if you use the drive through, but it's only because you're getting amazing fresh food. They are also fairly priced for the quality of product that you get.</Review>

<Text>Just what I was looking for. I was able to get a Gluten Free Hamburger with fries and a drink and it all was delicious. I will be returning. Only downside was the wait time but you gotta be understanding that they have a drive thru as well, so you just gotta be patient.<//Text>< username>

We liked the food. The staff wasnt very friendly, but they weren't rude either. There was 4 cashier's at the counter but we weren't acknowledged for about 10 minutes after we walked in.

We will probably go again, we just wont expect friendliness along with the good food.</review>

Me and my wife enjoy the atmosphere here. Big American flag painted on the wall (with all 50 stars, yes I counted) the food here is delicious. Their prices are reasonable considering a lot of their menu has organic ingredients. They also have neat black pipe/Edison bulb fixtures that look really nice.</review>

< Review>
Was very disappointed when I was told they have organic food, but when I asked if any of there vegetables were organic they said no. I also asked if there turkey was hormone & antibiotic free they didn't know so I asked if they could call the owner they did and he said NO. They didn't know if the chicken was hormone & antibiotic free either , owner said Yes on chicken. Workers need to know more about the food they r preparing and serving there customers. I would like more food places in the high desert to serve organic foods.< /Review>

Food is prepared quickly.  Service is excellent.  Meals are generous.  Menu is varied but relies heavily on fried food.  Quality is good and the prices over value.< /text>

Love this place. Food is amazing, staff is friendly, and prices are good. I get the organic chicken rice bowl, and everytime I am blown away from the flavor. Their nachos are also really amazing. A must stop for fresh tasty food. And amazing staff. Seriously the staff are amazing!</Review>

Today was my first time trying Home Town Grill.  I called my order in and picked it up at the drive thru.  It was ready when I got there, and it was delicious.  $9 for the shrimp basket that has popcorn shrimp, and I had zucchini. The portions were so big that I can have two meals of it. The salad was delicious including black olives and croutons.  Everything was perfectly cooked.  Lots of dressing and cocktail sauce was included.  I highly recommend Home Town Grill if you want really good food for a reasonable price.< /review>

We love the food here and have been regulars for 2 years. Most of the staff here including some of the managers are unfriendly, so we love to come in when Melissa is working. She is so outgoing and friendly to everyone. Lots of vegetarian options with organic food. Check this place out!<//Text>

Great food and prices. Always been a good experience when I go. Friendly staff and the wait isn't too bad. The steak dinner and pastrami are our favorites. Definitely worth checking out if you haven't yet.</text>

<Review>Dirty tables, and dirty dishes everywhere. The Chicago dog that I ordered had onions and cabbage, ( not a Chicago dog) no mustard, pickle, or tomato. They completely forgot the BLT that was also ordered. They brought chopped tomatoes in a dirty container with grease marks on it, after they brought the forgotten BLT. By that time the Chicago dog was cold. Worst food and service that I have had in a very long time. I will never go back!<//Review><pics>None<//pics>< rate>

Always spotless and nicely decorated. They have a drive thru which is great when you want home cooked type food on the go. Be warned this place is popular and has extremely limited seating.<//text>< pictures>

Sorry to say, once again if you go through the  Drive thru check your order before you leave..because your order is most likely wrong. But they sure charge you correctly..not the 1st,  2nd or third other wise i would not bash a small business..Get It Right All The Time Please..<//review>

< Review>
This was the first time I went to Down Home Grill, and it was a delightful visit. It was later in the afternoon, but I wanted the pork chop breakfast, I was disappointed no breakfast after around 11a.m., but the waitress suggested the pork chop dinner which came with a salad, fresh veggies, mashed potatoes and a large pork chop. I got my meal and could barely wait to get home to eat it! It was more than delicious and all fresh ingredients. (Did I mention I used the drive thru and got fast and friendly service, they also give senior discounts) I will be back again.🤗</Review>

I took a staff member there for lunch.  Even though they were quite busy, the servers/cashiers were attentive and courteous.  I will go again.  When busy be prepared to wait for seating!  Food was great👍<//review>

<Review>Quality of food has degenerated to disgusting. My fries were soaked in oil and soggy; literally made me gag and spit the food out. My BLT was subpar.  Customer service has reduced to arguing with the customer and being condescending; refused to listen in order to resolve the problem, just arguing.  Was told that no one has ever complained about their fries.  It is obvious that they are not reading all the reviews.  Shame on you for your lack of management skills and quality control.  I will never return and will never recommend this place.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

Best menu choices for healthier options in town. We love to come to this place and eat. Some of the staff is unfriendly (Tammy) but if your lucky enough to come in when Melissa is working you'll definitely get why they call it Down home. She and most of the staff are welcoming and friendly each visit. The quality of the food is definitely worth your hard-earned dollar. It would be completely unfair to the rest of the staff to put Tammy the eyeroller ( she littery does this in front of you) completely rude behavior towards guest on them. Most of the staff go out of thier way to be kind while  she is rude and unprofessional towards guest. we have been regulars for 2 years and NOT 1 Positive experience with her. Not one visit where she was anything but aloof and rude.  This the VERY BIG downside of coming here!! We are always relieved when she is not working.< /text>

When they opened the food was great but the last couple of times I've been the food quality has gone down along with the customer service and the prices were raised. Burger is ok but the fries are always way to oily and give me a stomach ache. Better burger spots out there for the price and quality.<//Review>

<Review>Hidden Jem. Great prices and great food. Opens early for breakfast at 5am. Also has a drive through if your in a hurry but want to eat good food that's fast, not fast food that's good. Don't let the drive up window fool you, the interior is small, but clean, cozy, and charming. A big plus is that the server beer on tap, but this is not a bar. Bring your family. Oh, and the ahi salad is AMAZING, and I think it was only $10. Try it with a Hanger Orange Wheat beer, pairs perfectly!</Review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

The food was tasty a little bit on the small side. I had the French Dip sandwich, fries and a lemonaid. $12 and change.

Reminds me of the old Wendy's commercial with that little old lady saying, ... "Where's The Beef?"</Review>

Prices went up but its still the same mediocre service... Fries are always soggy and soaked in grease and the burger is hit or miss sometimes. Need to work on quality control and tightening up the staff to be a little more professional.< /Review>

<Text>Great food with great staff! I'm giving three stars, though, because they an unsolvable space problem. They're getting pretty popular, and my group of 5 had trouble finding a place to sit down and eat. Also, they can chill out a little on the amount of salt they put on their fries.< /Text><UserId.>117018143412081067697</UserId.><name>Donald Brown</name></record>

<Text>Very SLOW in the drive thru. I waited 25 minutes for a salad that I called ahead for pick-up. I wasted my lunch break in the drive thru. Ridiculous. The last time I came it was the same SLOW service inside but they burnt my food. So disappointed. Plus they raised prices alot. I will not come back.</Text>< pics>

I ordered fish tacos and an ahi tuna salad.  I anticipated a wait for fresh food. However,  the fish tacos were soggy fish sticks with lettuce and a huge gob of garter sauce on a corn tortilla. The cilantro aioli is gross and thick and tastes nothing like cilantro. Just a garlic mayo. Super disappointed. This is the third time I visit, and I've been disappointed each time. Definitely over sold and under delivered.< /review>

It's been hit and miss for us. Have had overcooked burgers with wilted lettuce and a burrito that just didn't taste right. With that being said, we tried the kabobs the other night and they were delicious. Hopeful they are picking up their game.<//Text>

The burger tasted good, but easily fell apart into a mess after just three bites.  The fries were subpar and nothing to write home about.  The service was quick and pleasant.< /text>

<review>A few weeks ago had ordered carne asada burrito. 8 bucks. Came home with it and meat was burnt and just didn't taste fresh. Called them and they replaced it with the way the food normally comes out. Great!!!! 4 stars for the team there.</review>< Pictures>

Always loved this place, this morning came in for breakfast with my wife and finally had to leave due to a large table of drunks. I won't ever return. Lots of options.<//review>

<response>None</response><Review>First time trying it this evening; my wife ordered the food over the phone. I went to pick it up, and had a great experience. The staff were very friendly and seemed to keep a nice, clean and organized kitchen. Bomb! Definitely worth stopping through if you haven't already! We got the salmon salad and ortega chili burger with zucchini. 👍👍

Aaaaaaand.... Nevermind...

As much as I hate to say... Today, for our second visit we had a terrible experience. Onion rings were very overdone and were obviously held in a hot hold for quite some time. I do realize that I came in right before closing.. But c'mon guys, a solid preclose should never compromise the quality of the food... Don't batch cook after 8. Everything cook to order. I had a great guest experience with the gentleman up front while putting in my phone order and picking it up. The cashier had to remind the cook to add bacon on my chili burger... Which I'm not joking..  Had about a tablespoon of chili on it.. It was a pure joke and disappointing experience as opposed to my first time. I bought my wife a bacon burger combo with fries.. Fries were non- existent, burger was okay.. Again with the batch cooking (in regards to the bacon).... I called to let them know that they forgot my fries so that I could come in for them... The kid told me that I could come in on another day for my (paid) French fries as "compensation".. Which makes NO sense.. After telling him that he offered one bacon burger with it... My wife is pregnant and wanted some damn French fries tonight... And I wanted a delicious chili cheese burger... This was a TERRIBLE experience.. And please, to the owner... That is serious advice to maintain food quality throughout slow business hours.. Batch cooking wastes food and ultimately lowers the quality of things. I would seriously seek more experienced cooks with higher standards for YOUR restaurant.. You've got a good thing going... Dont let your employees mess that up ever. Quality is the biggest priority always.< /Review>< username>

<Text>Claims to be organic, but mostly it's only the meat. Sodas are typical high-fructose corn syrup, salad dressings are not organic or non-gmo, orange juice has 0% juice, lemonade had a strange after taste, the French dip sandwich tasted bad, cheese on the nachos was processed cheese like Velveta. I wouldn't go again.</Text>< Pictures>

<Rating>1< /Rating><user_name>Mia A< /user_name><response>None<//response><Review>Typical of food places up here. Provide amazing food & service initially. As time goes both food quality & service drop to below McDonald's standards. When a customer asks for certain condiments you should provide them. When a customer even goes as far as to say "I'll pay for them" provide them. Don't say it's ok we got this. Don't lie at the window about it. Today wasn't the first time. Also, besides asking for condiments how can this establishment send out a salad with no dressing. Send out an appetizer without sauce. Ridiculous. When they first opened their salads were top notch. Today & few other times in the past the salad is filled with iceberg not the good stuff. 1/2-3/4 of it is the white center of the head of lettuce. Hard & huge pieces. Where there is lettuce in here a majority of it is brown. The entire salad is sopping wet with water. Disgusting!
I'm only giving 1 star because I have too.

This review was left months ago idk why it's showing up today.

This place is still horrendous & I hope they go out of business soon. My mother went there tonight. I go to cut in half a bean & cheese burrito & it smells so bad. Like dog food or feces! Maybe the beans have spoiled idk but to serve this is despicable & truly reprehensible.
Pay full price for fried olives get 1/2 a serving. Shut your doors already.</Review>< user>

Great burgers, burritos, sandwiches, and fries.  Add fries and beer combo for $3-4, which is less than the cost of the beer!< /Review>

Food good as always, crowded as always, still not enough seating as always, red chairs for customers still not comfortable. If you don't mind waiting for a seat or taking it home, come check them out<//Text>
