My puppy is not social at all because of corona virus but he did such a good job with the staff and other puppies here. He got his wispy hair trimmed and he looks soo cute. Im so happy with the outcome. I wish his nails were rounded out but its OK. I definitely recommend.< /review>

<review>I took my dog in today at Bath N Biscuit and was so impressed! I moved a few years ago and it was too far to drive back to the groomer I always took my dogs. This business was referred to my daughter so I thought I would give it a  try. I have tried to bathe Daisy but I can’t do it and she was looking pretty raggedy, I think she was even embarrassed. I dropped her off not knowing what to expect. I was very, very surprised and happy at what she looked like, didn’t even look like my baby girl! The gentleman was extremely pleasant. I would recommend Bath N  is Biscuit to anyone that needs an excellent place to take their dogs for grooming. Along with a great job, it is very affordable!  Thank you for doing a beautiful job.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< rate>

I had to find a new place to take my dog since I moved to Modesto.  I looked at the reviews then had a great chat with an employee. I was very happy with the level of service and quality of work. Thank you very much for making my first experience finding a new place to bring my lab !!!<//review>

My poor dog is bruised and cries anywhere I touch him around his neck and chest.  It was his first visit and reported on pick up that he went a little crazy.  My husband said why didn’t you just call and say you couldn’t groom him.  They said he was hollering.  He just needed a short answer dog shave and bath.  I feel horrible that my poor boy had to go through this.  He has bruises on both sides of his groin.< /review>

Our dogs love this place! They treat them like royalty and allow them to casually “visit” with other when they’re well behaved. Our precious elderly golden who needs to lie down for grooming and nail treatments is catered to with tender accommodating care. On the floor! Very high recommendation.<//review>

This place is great. The grooming is top tier for a very reasonable price. Every time I go, the staff are very busy, so there is not much time for small talk. If you are looking to be pampered and told that your dog is amazing or wonderful, you’ll probably want to go spend $100+ somewhere else. They get quite a bit of business, so you’ll have to schedule a week in advance sometimes. Highly recommend.< /Text>

This is the worst place ever! Please don’t take your dog there. I took my poodle to get groomed in the morning and they took all day long to just bathe her. The employees hung up on me when I tried calling to get an update on my dog.They didn’t do the full service I paid for. The employees had me waiting outside for so long, just for them to do their job. They had the audacity to bring me the wrong dog and tried arguing with me saying it was my dog.< /Text>

Today we brought our newest puppy to get her groomed too.  This place treats us so well, and makes the animals relaxed and not afraid of their shop like going to the vet.  We highly recommend this place for their professional grooming and spa treatment for your animal.

<rate>2<//rate><review>I’ve taken my dog here on two occasions to get her nails trimmed. The first time she had one nail bleeding a bit and they told me to take care of it at home if she has any issues. Fine.

But I took her back again yesterday and they bring her out to me... with blood streaking underneath her as she walks. My puppy is happy to see me so she jumps onto my legs, staining my pants and also getting blood on my legs. I don’t mind mud or anything from my doggies, but their own blood? It made me sick to my stomach. They obviously didn’t know what they were doing.
I told them there was blood and they took her back and dumped her nails in a tub of some lotion looking creamy stuff. (Seems unsanitary to me but I don’t know what the stuff is).

They then give her back to me telling me to carry her so that the concrete doesn’t make her nails bleed more.

This would normally be fine but I had ankle surgery and I’m not supposed to carry much more than a few pounds... and my dog is NOT light. I had to carry her to the car then from the parking lot and up the stairs to my apartment. (In 100 degree weather).

On top of that, I counted 4 bloody nails. There could’ve been more but I didn’t count before they dunked her nails in that solution.
No excuses. If anything, go a little long than HURT my dog.

Never returning. I’ll take my business elsewhere or just do them at home from now on.</review><gmap_id>0x80905694942e9f7d:0x63cc66f952a003<//gmap_id><Name>Kassidy Aksland<//Name>< response>

It was very dirty with pee puddles on the inside of the gates where they take the dogs. On one occasion my brother took his dog here and witnessed one of the workers kicking a dog underneath them. It made a lot of sense for as to why my dog absolutely dreads going here vs other groomer shops. I don’t  live too far but two blocks away and often walk my dog near here. My final time taking her here: She got overwhelmed as we approached the door and panicked her way out of her collar and ran away. To my surprise she ran home and waited for me just outside the door. That was my last straw with this place and i choose not to take my animals there anymore< /text></record></dataset><record>

I just took my Fergie girl who is a 5lb yorkie/Maltese mix in to get groomed on 10/16/18. Brandy groomed her for the first time as I have had Maria and Babs groom her before. She did a fabulous job!!! Wrote down what I wanted, we talked it over, she took her time and she called me 20 min before my girl would be done! I’m all about customer service and they do just that! I love the environment as well and they are affordable!!! My mom recommended them to me and we’ve been going to bath and a biscuit ever since! Love the environment and they all know what they are doing! My Fergie girl is always a happy girl after a day at the spa! Also if you refer them to someone and they mention your name to your groomer you will get $5 bucks off your next appointment! They take care of you and you take care of them ❤️< /Text>

<review>It was my first time going to a groomer with my pet and I was really impressed. They have a spacious and clean atmosphere. I really like the bow they put on my girl when she was all trimed and smelling good. This is defiantly my spot now whenever my pomchi needs grooming.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

I absolutely love this place!! My dog is NOT easy to handle for grooming, but they always do a wonderful job, plus, he is always so excited to go there, which gives me confidence in their handling of him! I recommend them every chance I get!</Review>

This place takes WAY to long! What is the point in having a 8am if your dogs aren’t ready to be picked up until 4pm? We were told they are only human and it depends on the day! Well this is my dogs 4th trip and it’s been the same all 4 times!< /Text>

So unfriendly today!!  Makes us wonder how are they treating our dog? Same unfriendliness ? Not one groomer spoke to us. Katrina is our groomer, love the look of our  Shih Tzu when we pick him up but the unfriendly attitudes makes us want to go somewhere else.......<//text>

Can't believe this place isn't open on the weekend! Most people don't have time during the week. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone I know. Businesses like this do a disservice to the community.</Review>

<Review>Undoubtedly THE WORST Covid test experience since the beginning of the pandemic. BY FAR!
I have had over 80 Covid PCR tests over the last year due to the nature of my work.
With these people, I got a 24-hour PCR test on Sunday afternoon for a Tuesday morning flight. Not only did I have to wait for over an hour to get tested (other places really do it in less than 5 minutes!!!) but by Monday evening I had received nothing. I called them and they said they would send the results by 11.59pm on Monday. I woke up on Tuesday morning for my 8am flight and still I had received no results.
Luckily I got a rapid 30-minute PCR test at LAX (911 COVID testing on 9600 S Sepulveda Blvd, Los Angeles, CA 90045 - USE THEM!!) and I was able to board my flight with no issues (for a very important project I couldn't be late for, by the way!).
Six days later I got an email from this company saying that they won't be able to process my test! 6 days later!!!
The fact that they offered me a refund means nothing, since they didn't really provide me with any service...! If they had offered me the next Covid test for free, I might not have written this. But they didn't... so here we are!</Review>< resp>

<text>The process was easy! Booked my appointment online the night before. The check in was simple & from there you wait for a nurse & they explain the process. The nurse I got was so nice! It was my first time doing the nasal swab & he put my mind at ease & walked me through the process. Definitely recommend! Update I got my results in less then 30 min!</text>< pics>

Wonderful Clinic with amazing staff. I was given excellent service and guided through the process quickly and easily. There was some confusion with my sample but they upgraded my test and gave me the results in record time so I could travel the next day. Thank you Nate, Carlos and team! I would highly recommend this clinic. Thank you very much guys!</review>

<text>I took 30min Antigen test but I received test result 26 hours later. They have to refund $50 for 24-48hours late report but they refunded $35 only, They're not honest organization. Strongly Not Recommended. Waste you money and time.</text>< pictures>

Thanks for making the testing a painless procedure. The young lady who helped me with the pre testing stuff was wonderful. Very nice and a big help. She was very patient with me. The results were faster than I expected and the gentlemen doing the testing were very efficient.
Thanks so much!
Cheers!,

Start off by saying that the testing aspect of this was seamless and the staff was wonderful but since then it has been the WORST EXPERIENCE EVER.   A test that should take 72 hours at the most is approaching to pass the 5 day mark.  The lack of logistics to track the out going test is insane.  After you wait at least half n hour on the phone twice you speak to a robot with no sympathy or solutions.  I had an employee take the test at dodger stadium on Friday and get her results Saturday evening while I am still waiting on my results from Tuesday it’s now Sunday.    Don’t go here when you can go somewhere else and it free and fast.<//text>

This clinic is highway robbery. My wife and I took the 72 hour test in preparation for a flight. A couple days later they emailed us that something went wrong and they lost our samples. It was then less than 24 hours to our flight and we had no option but to pay $400 each for the rapid test. If you lose someone's test sample you need to do everything you can to contact them asap. Call or text, but email is not enough. They refused to refund us. Get tested somewhere else.</Text>

The place is quick but the person that served me jammed the testing instrument so far up my nose and with enough force that it is still sore half a day afterwards. It is bad that you go in feeling fine and you leave feeling unwell. Never mind the fact that you pay a lot of money to have such an experience.<//Text>

<Review>Drove over without an appointment to see if they offered rapid testing. (I saw a crazy price on their website but it’s for international travelers) No one else was there and all I had to do was fill out some stuff on their website before getting back into line. A few people showed up but in total I don’t think I was there even half an hour. Testing was quick and not very invasive! Got my results in 20 mins and was about $150. Very thankful for everyone working hard during these horrendous times!</Review>< user>

I need to be retested as soon as possible because the technician who took my swan inserted the q-tip pretty low and I think I received a false negative as a result. My entire family has covid and my boyfriend and I both developed symptoms same time. And we both tested together in Tuesday and he got a positive and I got a negative then 4 days later I go back to same place and got tested and received a negative again. But this time i wasn’t happy with the technician who took 3 seconds in my right side of my nose and 1.5 seconds in my left side of my nose! I paid $175 for a decent test! I want a refund or have my tests Redone! Please some one get back to me.<//text>

PROS:
- Able to make an appointment for same day - 30 minutes later
- Professional and courteous help on site
- Results in under an hour
- On site personal were able to eventually accommodate me as I did have immediate confirmation of my test purchase via my Chase text alert
CONS:
- Wasn't able to get the COVID (rapid) test only. Had to pay extra to get the COVID + flu (rapid) test. $185
- Was told on site that I wasn't in the system. Had to pull over to the side in my car for 35-40 minutes while I kept refreshing my email, texts - awaiting for confirmation that never came.
- No cust. svc. number to call - only a bot. Unable to get help.
- Confirmation of my appointment via text and email finally came (5 hours after my test and 4 hours after my results).< /Review>

<Text>Made an appointment Friday night for Saturday. My problem is not with the staff. They did an excellent job. However I paid for a rapid ONE HOUR test. It’s been over 8 hours now. This is ridiculous and should not be advertised as such. I want my money back. You pay for a rapid test for a reason. Skip this place. Also, they only respond to good reviews. Come on guys, highly unprofessional.< /Text><response>None< /response><gmapID>0x80c295e25aaa81e5:0x4f89b54dd1f1111d</gmapID>< userid>

Excellent service, well beyond what would be expected. Not only did they change my tires but they also ordered and installed a new trunk gasket because my old one had torn. They ordered and replaced a missing mud flap and a damaged rear view mirror too. Amazing!!</text>

I made an appointment online and was able to pull right into the garage when I arrived. Everyone at the shop was extremely nice and took the time to explain to me pricing options, pros and cons of each of those options, as well as warranties. Living at Ocean Beach, my car has gotten pretty rusty, and the staff at the shop, in the office as well as in the garage, were able to give me some more insight on those current issues as well as issues I may need to address in the future. My experience overall was really great and I definitely plan to return in the future.</review>

Very happy with service and time spent getting oil change at Big O Tires Laurel Hill location. Friendly staff with clear communication. We strolled over and shopped at Laurel Village and the car was ready when we returned ahead of estimate. We came here unscheduled after learning of (and abandoning) a 4 hour estimate at our original scheduled location.<//Text>

It’s nice to be able to go in and get your car serviced and be confident that it’s probably going to be a pretty straightforward and painless experience.

When I had my oil changed last week using a Groupon coupon, they told me I should get new tires soon (they were pretty bald). I have a limited income, so I said it would have to wait. Well stimulus money came in so, I went to just get new front tires (I had done online comparisons and chose Big O) but they gave me a great deal on the rears and a discount on the alignment so I took it. Service was quick and people there are friendly and courteous.<//Review>

I got a quote over the phone and my fiance brought the car in the next day. She had a piece of paper with the quote on it and the details. She handed it to the man and he ended up trying to charge $70 more than the quote. I had to call him to sort it out and he claimed he didn't see the number on the piece of paper. I guess he thought he could get away with such a stunt because he was dealing with a woman. Then they tried to charge me a crazy amount for an alignment. Then they wanted to replace my front brakes for another crazy amount of money. I called jiffy lube and in two minutes I got a quote that was over $100 less expensive for the exact same service. Big O didn't even bother matching Jiffy Lube's price, not that I wanted to give them any more business anyway. They also took 2.5 hours longer than they said they would. Don't go here.</text>

The folks at Big O are so nice, helpful and efficient. A few weeks ago I had trouble pumping up my tire at the gas station, so I went across the street to ask if Big O would let me use their shop air. They have immediately helped me out, and were so nice that I came back later for my oil change and tire replacement. Their prices are very good, and they don’t upswell or waste time. Will start going there regularly<//review>

Everyone there is so helpful, and really go above and beyond. Jasmine was especially helpful. “The truck guy” is great, I wish I caught his name. I feel like every time I go they are honest and helpful. I’m not the most educated person on trucks or vehicles and they take the time to explain to me what’s going on and what I need or will need to get done. This big o is so much more then just a place to get your tires done. You can get all the work you need there by professionals that care just as much about the people that come as they do your vehicle. Pricing is good, they opt for using the best of the best which I personally appreciate because my truck is old and I want it to last as long as possible. Thank you so much Big-O on geary!<//Text>

<Text>I brought my car in to fix a slow leak in one of my tires in the morning before 10Am. Waited 3+hours and had to ask for status to find out a nail punctured my tire on shoulder side and not repairable. I ended up replacing two front tires to get all 4 tires matching to same size. When I got my car, all 4 tires air pressures were low according to the pressure sensing caps I used on my tires. All were showing red but the person who worked on job just ignore them... so long wait time and bad work quality on this visit.</Text>< Pictures>

Used to love this shop, must have been taken over by new owners unfortunately I will never ever be returning. Worst service ever. I called and asked when I could come in they said right now so I get there and they said it would be 2 hours for a tire change so I left and came back an hour and 45 minutes later and my car was moved to the street and untouched. Front desk lady was the rudest person I've ever met. I waited 2 hours and 15 minutes and left with my purchased tire in my trunk and am getting it put on by another tire shop. Do better</Text>

<text>Came here to get an oil change. Not my first nor will it be my last. Took around 85 mins in the morning so it wasn’t fast but they were thorough. They called to let me know the engine filter and battery needed to be replaced. They did not push me into getting the services. They told me what I should replace. I like that the shop does not push sales. I went to another place to confirm whether these guys said was or was not true. It was true.</text>< Pictures>

<review>I enjoyed working with Big O tires. I usually go the Mercedes dealership. But when I got a flat tire 1 block from my home, AAA filled my tire with air and followed me to Big O tires, 1 block away, to get it fixed. And I'm glad I did. I could save so much money by working with them and I look forward to working with them in the future. They were expedient and courteous. My tire was fixed quickly and for a reasonable price.< /review>< pics>

< Review>
I brought my car in yesterday, 11/25, to change out my rear driver side tire that had a large screw lodged in one of the treads. When I discovered it, I put duct tape over the screw to keep it in place and let me drive to an auto shop. I had visited another auto shop first who indicated they couldn't repair the tire due to weakening of the sidewall. I placed an order for new tires that would arrive on 11/27. However, I was planning to drive to LA for Thanksgiving and didn't want to do so with a weakened tire and decided to just replace the one tire. I explained this at Big O as the reason for wanting to only replace one tire as opposed to all 4 as is normally done. The service was done, then I departed for Los Angeles today.

100 miles in to the journey, my check engine light comes back on. I was surprised because I had my car serviced on 11/24 at the dealer. I also had just replaced my first flat tire after 50k miles and figured it was unlikely to have another literally the next day. I stopped and saw that my front driver side tire was low on pressure. I began inspecting the treads and found the very same screw as before that had duct tape over it. The one individual tire I paid to be specifically replaced was simply put back on to my car and one of my good tires was disposed of. The duct tape held up long enough that I didn't realize any of this until many miles away.

I realize this exact situation may not happen to many people, but nevertheless it's frustrating and worrying as I question driving another 300 miles with a faulty tire and paying another shop to fix this.</Review>

I dropped my car off at 8am and got a call back about my car an hour after dropping it off telling me it needed some other work. I agreed to the extra work being done then never got a call back to pick my car up. I called in at 5:30pm and the shop closes at 6pm. They said “we must have called the wrong number”, but they were able to call the right one hours before when I needed more work???!

I showed up to get my car and the woman at the front had to call to the back 3 times for my car to be brought around leaving me to wait about 30min before they brought it literally across the street.

The man who drove my car back to me did not put down any floor mats so now my front seat floor has greasy shoe marks all over the mats and I will be getting it cleaned. You dropped the ball. My money will now go to another business.< /Review>

I am so happy to be located nearby Big O Tires. They do a consistently great job and I can trust them far more than my local dealership. They fixed something for $35 when my dealership said it would cost $600 to look into. They aren’t always the fastest service but I would rather have good service than quick service. Thanks for being consistent with what you all do.</text>

<Review>I visited BigO on 3/21. Everything was good except the time it took. I had an appt but it took 3 1/2 hours. I was told by an employee that an appt was really a drop off time. That is ok but why not call it a drop time. Staff was very friendly and nice. I have been to this location probably 15 times and will go back but will think an appt isn't really an appt. All I had done was an oil change and 2 tires.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1617050653625, 'text': 'Hi Julie. We are sorry that you did not have a satisfying experience.

Big O Tires has had my back twice during this pandemic. They accommodated my schedule for pick up and drop off, created and maintained a high standard for safety and sanitization, and have been clear and concise in all transactions. Car maintenance can be stressful and costly, but they truly make it easy. Also, they work quickly and communicate effectively. The GM and Jasmine made me feel confident as a consumer! Thanks, guys!</review>

We brought our vehicle in for a flashing tire warning light.  It was suggested we make an appointment for the next day and that it would take 2 hours to complete.

We returned at 10:00 a.m. the next morning and the same person who helped us indicated the staffing was short.  I overheard an employee speaking to a customer by phone indicating there was a four hour backup, they could drop off their car with a possibility of work being completed by end of day, but no promises.

When we returned 2 hours later, we were told that the car had not yet been started. We were having a sensor replaced for the tire.

At 12:40 we received a phone call indicating that the car was completed. When we arrived 10 minutes later the same person who was helping us indicated he needed to speak to a customer my phone which took another 15 minutes.

He then made a loud speaker announcement asking that the car be brought around. After standing on the street for 10 minutes, we recgnized our car parked halfway down the street.

When an attendant came out asking what car we were waiting for, we asked for our keys so we could get the car ourselves.

We appreciate that the car was completed and at much less than what a dealer charges.  We did not appreciate not being informed ahead of time that they were short staffed and that we would have to wait an extra hour or possibly to the end of the day to have our car completed. Very poor customer service!

The reality is that they accomplished the task in about 30 minutes. They could have just done this and not caused any angst or grief. Again poor customer service!< /review>

<review>Big O Tires came through once again.
I have been using them for over 20 years.
Great service as usual. Keep in mind they are busy, specifically right before the rain season. Wait times are unpredictable. In my case I drop off wheals and tires one day, and pick up the next day. With no time waisted.
Thank you guys, I will see you soon, as I have two more vehicles coming up.< /review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

They changed my oil and engine air filter.  The price was right.  They did it in good time.  They checked other stuff without charging me.  Get there early in the morning.  The early bird doesn't have to wait as long.  They are (rightfully) popular.< /review>

They changed tires when no cars left in garage. It took 30 minutes to fix it. I got my car at 6:30 pm. 5h30minutes wasted. Worst service ever. I never come this location ever again and will let know others how worst is it. Dissatisfied and got disrespected by this location. Worst service location.

The service was fantastic!  I brought the flat tire into the shop and they were helpful in identifying a replacement tire as well getting it installed quickly.  I was very impressed.<//text>

<text>They told me 3-4 hours for an oil change, I waited for 4 hours and when I checked they didn’t even start with the oil change, it only takes 15 minutes maximum, they are putting the people who are changing tires and breaks in the same line of the people who just want an oil change, so I requested my car back because I’m not gonna waste more time, their restroom is out of order and the TV doesn’t work, so 4 hours of nothing, I realized that they don’t even deserve my business, so I took my business to valvoline where I changed my car oil in 15 minutes.

They could’ve sent me to a different location, where they don’t have much traffic but no.</text>< Pics>

Came here before, bought 2 tires and the experience was fine.  This time I came in to patch a tire, asked the tattoo Asian guy how long and the pricing, " $50.00 and a few hours."  My response, "let me call my wife to let her know" and his assumption response, "if you are not going to do it, PULL your car outside."  Great customer service!  Guess what?  Wheel Works was so much nicer, friendlier and they understand customer service!  Don't know how this business stay open with bad customer service.  Why would anyone pay for lousy service and poor attitude?  If these guys income were base on commission,  I am sure their attitude would be a million percent better.</Text>

Very professional from beginning to end. They gave me a discount on the alignment from 150$ to 100$. I guess they felt sorry for me since I’ll be 69 and looked
A little out of alignment myself. Friendly staff. I highly recommend this Big O on Geary. They even had my special tires in stock!</Text>

Poor customer service. Brought my car in early for two tire replacement.  They said come back in two hours. Five hours later they still didnt complete the job. No apologies and very unsympathetic. Turns out the salesperson who checked me in left for the day and never bothered to pass down information.</Review>

So either they overbook their appointments, or they just don't honor them at all. A whole day wasted since this should not have taken 5-6 hours. If I make an appointment, I expect to be serviced at that time, not three hours later.< /Text>< Rating>

< Review>
Recently noticed brakes were grinding, took it in to get it checked out. Turns out all 4 needed replaced with new rotars. And after replacing that apparently my brake master cylinder went out. Totaling in almost 1300.00. As soon as i drove away after everything was replaced, still grinding. And now sqeaking. Mind you it took a whole day for this to be done, and the next morning. And 600.00 in labor later. Taking it back in to see what the problem is now. We will see. So far a big waste of time and money for nothing to be fixed and only to be made worse.

Took it in now aparently they keep trying to upcharge and say we need more work. Will take a few hours to even look at it. Another day with no car. Yay.

Sincerely a pregnant lady due any day now with a toddler with a very very tight wallet. Do not trust nor feel safe with this location..<//Review>

<rating>1< /rating><Review>Unethical !!!! Business !!!!!! Beware of their tire specials !!!!!! Really deserve a zero !!!! With over 50 negative complaints against them wright on these review’s !!!!!!
On Friday July 17, 2020 I went to Big O Tires on Geary & the Mgr.wil sold us a MESA tires they had on sale buy 2 get 2 free tires for which we where charged $626.91we thought we got a good deal but as the weeks went by we noticed the tires had no grip on steep hills & that the tires weren’t gripping every time we were on a hill the tires would not grip & the vehicle would roll back because the tires did not gripmaking our vehicle skid & the same when we would brake down hill, I thought maybe the tires need to wear a little & then the tires will start gripping. My fiancée would get really scared going up hill because it just kept Sliding & happening we told our friends & family & decided to contact Big Tires on Geary & told Will the Mgr. the problem & the next day brought our vehicle back to big o tires September 10, 2020 & explained the problem that the tires had no grip & we didn’t feel safe with these defective tires that had no grip & & that we were willing to pay the deference in price for better tires with grip & instead of replacing the tires Wil said he could only refund$277 for the two tires & we where charged $626.54 with about $354 unexplained charges & gave me a hard copy quote full price $465 totally unethical to replace tire which we told them we didn’t feel safe because the tires where skidding without traction, Wil The Mgr. proceeded to tell me there’s nothing we can do & cant just replace them because the tire company won’t refund us for those tires & we would just end up throwing those tires away, I explained I was disabled & on a fixed monthly income & couldn’t afford that & that the tires had no grip at all & that I only receive a monthly social security check & that it was a huge sacrifice for me to have purchased those defective tires that had no grip & that would mean to have to wait until October 1st when I get my social security check to be able to exchange them.  On 9/24/2020 I was returning from my nephews apt I was coming down Gough & there was a lot of traffic it was moving at between 20 & 30 miles a hour I saw the pick up truck stop at the corner & when I tried to brake & tried to stop my vehicle it slid down the hill into the back of a pick up truck, only One week & a half later after I went to complain & request a exchange that I needed for The defective new Mesa tires they sold us had no grip or traction that we told the Mgr.Will about prior & went to Big o Tires on Geary specifically to complain about it. Since the accident my car has been declared total loss & my premium will be affected by these defective Mesa tires that had no grip. The Big O Tires Mgr. Will on Geary has been totally unethical un professional to what we addressed him with prior to our vehicle sliding down a hill on Gough putting our lives in danger as we clearly told the Mgr.Will prior to it happening & we will be contacting 7 on your side to report The Big O Tires on Geary & it’s unethical business practice. They have been reported to our insurance company which will be investigating this situation.< /Review><pics>None</pics><userid>103562187361576255278<//userid>< Gmap_id>

This place was so kind. I was in San Fransisco with my niece on a girl scouts trip when my tire on my f250 4x4 was going low. This place let me pull in the back door and they filled up and checked all of my tires. Never tried to sell me a thing and pretty much stopped what they were doing to get me back on the road. Great service!</Text>

<Text>After telling me it would take 45 mins for an oil change, they had not begun working on my car after the first hour. Clerk was very rude, and this location has no regard for time or courtesy. Manager apologized for clerks behavior. I would not recommend this location to anyone. Instead of being apologetic, they made it seem like I was being unreasonable and trying to jump to the start of the line. Oil changes could be conducted almost any body shop, do not waste your time here.<//Text><user_id>116064195973499681765<//user_id></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Despite a little longer service time than I expected because one of the TPSM sensors I brought in was defective, the technician and the shop manager did a great job of keeping me informed.  I also observed how thorough and patient they were with other customers, too.  All of this happened on a miserably hot day in San Francisco, but everyone in the shop just did their work and didn't complain.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

<text>I have been a long time customer of Big O for over 20 years. After my experience with Tony I have taken my business elsewhere. I took my car in for a rotation and to fix a nail. Tony refused to service my car and insisted I need all 4 new tires. I bought these tires from Big O a little over 4 years ago and only 21,000 miles on them. Tony insists they can not legally work on it because tires did not have enough tread, too old, and weather cracked. I left and checked my tires with a Quarter and could not see top of George Washington's head which is 1/8" tread on thinnest part. Using a quarter to test tread depth is a more stringent threshold than using Abraham Lincoln's hairline on  a penny. I took my car elsewhere for a second opinion and they saw I had adequate tread and my tires not weather cracked. I did decide to buy 4 new tires from this place on my terms. Big O lost a sale and a longtime customer.
Tony needs a lesson on customer service. He was rude, obnoxious and spoke in a raised tone of voice. I did not feel he had my back as a customer and that his objective is serving himself rather than the customer.<//text>< Time>

So,  the mechanics are super nice and they do quality work.  Good pricing. The waits usually a couple hours.  This is my second time visiting here. I knocked a star because at some point during my tire rotation and oil change,  the works opened my glove compartment,  probably to look for registration,  and , in their apparently mad scramble, the knocked out out a bunch of the other stuff I had in there. Wouldn't have cared or probably even noticed if they had just put it back,  but for some reason they just left it.
So I picked up my car after it was serviced, thanked the dude who gave me back my keys, and got in. Low and behold, the passenger side is strewn with the shame of my glove compartment hoarding--- manicure kit,  napkins,  old mail,  my emergency m&ms. Granted,  they couldn't have anticipated the open, half empty bag of candy would be in the compartment,  but I was honestly thrown by the fact that they just left all the mess on my floor for me to see. Just weird. Those wasted m&ms just taunted me from my passenger seat.   Anyways,  I'll probably go back again,  and just leave the registration on the seat for them.

Tl;Dr:  good prices,  good service, service might take a while.  Leave your registration/manual in an easy to reach place for the workers.</Review>

From the beginning to the end I had a perfect experience.  I reached out to several BigO Tire locations but had the best experience with the guys on Geary Street from my initial phone conversation to getting my car in the shop to the end product.  They were very helpful, pleasant and so willing to help.  Anthony was the best!< /text>

Franchise location. I had to be seen right away, since a competitor of theirs wanted to gouge me. Called and spoke to Yuri on the phone, explained the situation, and like the Price is Right, he said "come on down". Everyone was super nice and wanted to make sure I was taken care of, was able to get my car fixed right away. Said they do a lot of drop ins, no appointments needed. I would definitely go back.< /review>

I booked an appointment for Tuesday last week at 8am. When I showed up, they had tires for a Toyota Ercel, rather than my truck (which was labeled on my email). I had to return two days later so I could get the correct tires.
I had my appointment at 8 am that same week on Thursday, in hopes to get the truck out quick. But I was wrong, it took from 8am to 1:40pm just to put new tires on my car. Because of this I was late to work.
Incredibly unrealiable and disorganized, it should never take 5 hours to change 4 tires, especially when booked an appointment first thing in the morning. Never coming back.< /review>

I had been losing air in one tire and popped in somewhat late in the day. It turned out they were able to fix it so I was able to drop of the car and pick it up a couple of hours later.  The young gentlemen at the counter was friendly but also very new.  At one point he had a question about something in the system and another guy who appeared to be some sort of supervisor displayed poor behavior and impatience with the newer employee.  This is NOT professional behavior, especially that it was in front of a customer.  I was embarrassed for that newer employee, who happen to be very friendly and helpful.  It makes me consider whether I'd go back to that location.  I hope that the manager of that location reads this and takes note.  Is this how this location or all Big O locations treat they're employees?< /review>

I received an original quote for four new tires online.  When I called in advance of my appointment, I was told those tires were not in stock, which I found strange, since the appointment to install them had been confirmed.  Nevertheless, I was offered a better, more expensive tire, at the same price.  I was skeptical at first -- I always think I'm getting ripped off -- but researched the tires and found the ones offered, were, in fact, substantially better.  So, that was fantastic.

I was also told on my call that it would take about 90 minutes to install my tires.  I planned my morning around that.  When I arrived -- 10 minutes before my appointment time -- I was told it would be 2-3 hours.  In fact, it took 3 hours, plus another hour to do a recommended alignment.  That was not so fantastic.

When I came to pick up the car, I asked to see the alignment report.  I remarked that only one of the measurements was out of spec and asked if that was enough to warrant an alignment.  The guy behind the counter gave me a look like I was a total idiot and quickly brushed off my question in a way that made me feel like a total idiot.  Fact is, I am a total idiot when it comes to cars.  That's why I always feel like I'm getting ripped off.  But, I don't want to be made to feel that way.  A better approach might be for the person to walk me through how to properly read the alignment report and explain what the measurements actually mean, in addition to their implications for safety, comfort, tire wear, etc.-- things I was later able to go home and research on the internet.

Prior to that experience at pick-up, everyone had been friendly, professional and courteous.  Big O is a fine place to get your tires done.< /Text>

Terrible place, the guy behind the counter HON is a scam artist and the other one Sangeep or whatever his name is was super rude but the worst one was the older guy Anthony Leung. So I called them and asked them for a price of 4 tires providing them with all the correct details and specifications that are needed, they confirmed that they had the tires that I was looking for and quoted me for them. I asked them if they were sure they had the tires I was looking for HON confirmed he had them and emailed me the quote.  I told them I was waiting for the towing truck to tow my car  and take it to their shop and that I should be at their store in 2 hours or so. Up until this point everything was fine.

Once I arrived at the shop  with my car towed by the truck,  they took a look at my rims and tires and said that they had quoted me wrong that they had those tires but they were actually 400$ dollars more for each tire making it a total of 1600$ more than what they had initially quoted me for. I was seriously in shock, these guys work with numbers and details I was asking a correct explanation to this and they wouldn't give it to me. This is fraud they make you come to their shop and once you are there they quote for whatever price they want, hell its San Francisco right?  Everyone has extra cash and no-one wants to be stressed out on looking for another shop we'll not me. They wasted my time and my triple A service and because of this and the rude old guy Anthony Leung that told me to "shut up" when I was complaining about this I will report them to the BBB I have the email for what they quoted me for and the other that they wanted to quote, once I got in their store I'm a Senior lady on my late 60's and I feel that not only was I mistreated but also they tried to scam me. Shame on you scammers!!!<//Text>

I do not recommend this place. I purchased two new tires and they put on one new and a used one, without telling me. I noticed a day later, called them and was told I have to wait two days for my serviceman to return ro work. They offered me no explanation.< /review>

I’ve already wasted enough time and money on this place, so wasting even more elaborating on how dishonest and shady they are isn’t appealing. However, I’ll try to be concise. I came here to replace two tires with sidewall damage. I agreed to a very expensive pair of tires, as that’s what I currently had on my vehicle. After picking up the car and then leaving for two weeks, i returned to find the same two tire sensors indicating low pressure. I crawled under my vehicle to inspect, and then leaned that they had replaced my 2 GOOD tires and threw out the bad ones. Awesome stuff. I explained the situation, was met with minimal understanding and just loud, obnoxious, talking over me. After finally getting able to get a word in, I agreed to purchase 2 more tires at a discounted rate. Obviously annoyed in an unnecessary expense, but my options were limited. At the same time I needed an HID headlight, (the ones that last a lifetime.) That was 3 months ago, I’m now on hour number 2 of waiting for them TO REPLACE A HEADLIGHT. I understand there is a line, first come first serve, etc. But seeing as that they’ve been crooks, at least they could be quick about it; my own fault for expecting decent out of this location.

Tl/dr; Go anywhere else in the city for your automotive needs. I’m usually reasonable, understanding, and patient. These people are so dishonest and inconsiderate, they managed to generate enough annoyance to warrant this post. Worst garage I’ve ever been to.<//Text>

$50 to take a screw out and patch it.

AFTER telling me my tires were to worn (10k on a 60k tire, less then 5 months old!

You probably need new ball joints they said.

I did those before the tires. Followed by the alignment!

Untrustworthy thieves!<//Review>

They are efficient and very nice, HOWEVER it's always a 2 -3 hour wait anytime I go in for a rotation of my tires or to have a flat repaired.  Seems like something could be done to be a bit more effective in getting customers in and out.  I am about to the point of finding another tire dealership who can offer better ongoing service.  I have always rationalized the wait by going across the street and doing my work at the coffee shop, but now that I am retired, I don't find my having to fill that much time as amusing.<//Text>< pictures>

Unreasonable policy's used to not honor warranty's. Two times now been told I have run flat damage, but the first time I was told that, on second inspection of the tire they notice that the had a factory defect but still charged me for putting on the tire. Now they are put back on my tire without fixing the nail holes so when I got there to pick it up 3 hours later it was flatter than when I dropped it off.< /review>

<text>Extremely disappointed experience out there, two Asian guys at front desk rude to the customers, not only to me btw while I was waiting there I saw couple situations. Time frame is also horrible. If you wanna save time and money find out other locations. Otherwise it will be stressful experience for you. I will never use this shop again and don’t recommend you as well. They also can added to the final check some options without asking you so be careful and check everything before paying. I forgot to tell you something if they tell you it will take 1 hour to replace 1 tire(that what I had just one simple flat tire) u can add 1,5h or 2h to that eta.</text>< time>

< review>
Really disappointed at this place. I came in at 8:30am to get 2 new rear tires. The worker told me it would cost me around $270 and it would take hour and a half. I waited almost 2 hours and at 10:45 am worker told me they only have 1 tire for the price they told me. I asked them what are the other options. He offered me only Bridgestone tired which cost $200 per tire. I was really tired and just wanted to get over it because my tired were really bad and it was a rainy day. Luckily I me and my dad both had $100 certificates which we purchased from Groupon for $50 each. In total It came up to $480. This is ridiculous because before it was $270 and they not only wasted my time but also ruined my day. Since I had 2 $100 certificates I paid $280 but if I didn’t have those certificates, I would’ve payed $480 for only 2 rear tires. I don’t know how they keep track of their inventory, but it should not take more than 2 hours to tell me that they don’t have the tires they offered me for the price I wanted.< /review>

Really bad experience, didn't get the tires I wanted, feel like I got swindled on price and service and attention to the customer was downright awful. Don't go to this place, I never will again.< /review>

I have came this place at  pm2:00 for oil change.
Now, time is pm 5:30.
After work, didn’t put any milage sticker on window.
And parked my car beside used tire dummy.
They didn’t any mention of excuse.
And I have to clean up car inside because worker’s bad smell
Left.

Know your car, tell them what you need and they'll get it done.  I've had my run-a-round-the-block with Big O Tires, but all-in-all and definitely after some pretty major hiccups, they've done me right and continue to do me right to this day.
I feel any place other than your dealership is going to have a hard time diagnosing your car or doing work on your car even if it's a car that's well known and your only other choice is to go to the dealer where you pay dealer mechanic pricing and you wait for dealer timing to get your car back.  Will, Wes and all of their team have squeezed me in, helped me with payments and replaced my tires and other items (brake pads) under warranty without question.
I realize most people think mechanic shops and the mechanics are crooks because we don't know anything about cars as a rule, but if you get to know your car, get to know them and give them a chance they'll do you right.  I've been going back for years and they always do it right or make it right and that you cannot say about a lot of other places.< /text>

<review>We had a particularly frustrating experience at this location. We dropped off our car for a tire alignment and we were told it would take an hour and a half. We called the shop 2 hours later and they said that they had yet to get to it. If it was taking longer that expected, it why weren't we informed? They kept our car close 4 hours, and the attendant was defensive when we said that in the future it would be helpful if we had gotten a heads up on the wait. In addition, they did not place the paper floor mats for servicing.  Did not offer a discount or any reason for us to return to the location.</review>< pics>

<text>I took my car here last weekend to get a tire repaired, and overall I received fine and fair service.  There was nothing about the place that hugely impressed me.  The waiting room is just OK, and could benefit from including a vending machine for sodas and snacks.  The service people were fine and relatively easy to understand, but it wasn't all that clear where to pick up my car.  The facility is OK enough.  That said, there was nothing about the place that hugely disappointed me.  It struck me as solid overall, hence my "It's OK" rating.<//text><Rating>3<//Rating>< username>

< Review>
This store has earned my one star rating. I am very disappointed, came in did replace my 4 tires as per their recommendation and an alignment as well as a  left tie rod and i so proceeded with their recommendation. After few weeks i went to my mechanic for a regular maintenance of my vehicle and my mechanic noted that the boot in between the tie rod was completely warned out. I was in a total disbelief when I show it. According to my mechanic a "California Licensed Mechanic" with over 30 years of experience he told me that was the sloppiest job ever. You shall not do business here. In addition when i brought my car back they made me wait another 3 hours giving priority to their new customers instead. Management in this shop needs an overhaul.< /Review>

The Asian manager doesn’t know the meaning of customer service. He forgot he is doing a service business. He insulted his worker because I asked to check my tire have a nil on it or not. He just wants me to buy a new tire.</text>

<Review>These technicians work effectively and quickly, and have vast amounts of knowledge and expertise in the matter especially Tires. I enjoyed working for them during the summer and would recommend this place for their prices and great selection on tires for the most cost effective or for those willing to spend BREAD on their beloved vehicles, afterall you love your car right?

Thieves!!!! Stay away!!!!!!

I brought car in to fix a rattle and they misdiagnosed the problem, charged me $500 to fix it yet when I drove out of the garage I noticed the rattle was still there. Had to leave my car for a couple more days to get the work that I'd already paid for competed.

WORST PART - A few days later I noticed my OBD plug-in computer chip that I'd purchased privately had been removed and from under the steering wheel. The only place my car had been other than in my own garage was in these guys' hands. I called multiple times and was given the run around by Will, the manger. He told me he'd look at the security cameras and get back to me which he never did. I went in person 3 times and each time was told that there was nothing they could do and weren't responsible.

This is the worst business I've ever dealt with and I highly regret taking my car there.

Go anywhere but here.</Text>

<text>I have been going to Big O at 3040 Geary for two years. I had some trouble with the front end of my SUV (off road FJ Cruiser) due to banging it up on one of my recent boulder climbing runs. They diagnosed the problem that other mechanics had not been able to do and they quoted me a price that was very fair. The work was done on time. I have gone there 3 or 4 times since then for oil changes and tire rotation etc. Except for the most recent time, things were great. this most recent time they took 2.5 hours instead of 1.5 hours. I was waiting and it was a bit frustrating. Nevertheless I will continue to go back because they are competent, (usually) fast and they try harder.< /text>< user_id>

<resp>None</resp><Review>I'm a used car dealer owner as well as a 30 cars rental fleet. I've been going to this location for the past 7 months after expand to San Francisco. Since it's only 3 miles away from my branch. I love and enjoy working with Will Pak. I could give Will 5 stars but Moe is a real mole of this location.

So I have an account with them and Will always give me a good deal as I'm a wholesaler. However, there is an incident when Will was on vacation. And of course I still need to go for maintenance, hence I gave Moe a chance. He did help me but he did ask me for a FREE rental car for one of his customer which he somehow messed the customer car up. They keep the car for 4 days for FREE. However, they did not return me the car on time, and as a result, my GGeAround rental voided and I had to pay them a fee. I was mad at Moe because he did not keep his words, and all of sudden he throw all the bad words at me. Effing and bs-ing flying all around the air. He threaten me to beat me up, kick my b*** sacks. Ask me to go down the street for one on one. What types of service providers attitude Moe has? To me it's the real definition of un-educated and rude. He told me he's 40 years old and he ain't afraid of anything.

Lastly, I don't know what does it has to do with me being Vietnamese. He swear the whole Vietnamese community and ask he not afraid if I bring the whole community to face him. This is a RACISM act as well as DISCRIMINATION even though it has nothing to do with my RACE nor my NATIONALITY. I will escalate this matter.<//Review>< gmap_id>

When I asked the sale representative how much will it cost me, his boss asked him "If I was mad and if so charge him double" this is not cool so if you come here dont let them due any work you didn't authorized and inspect your vehicle before leaving the auto shop if you feel like you been had call the california licence office and file a complaint.< /text>

One of the managers at
BIG O TIRES
2040 Geary Boulevard San Francisco California 94118
pull out a huge bar to hit the tow truck driver with it we have to call the police just because  tow operator wasn't able to put the vehicle all the way inside his shop due to the fact that the vehicle front tire Was falling off on top of that there was not enough space to put the vehicle all the way inside please be careful if you're dropping off a vehicle because the manager might come out with a metal stick to hit you if you don't put the vehicles inside at the end we didn't want to press charges on him even he was wrong swing at someone with a sharp metal object next time we won't feel sorry and will press charges< /Text>

Terrible experience. These guys will try to charge you for everything under the sun if you don't challenge them. Tried to charge me for TPMS sensors (which my car doesn't have) and I had to look up the tire price on my phone to get them to meet the price on their own website (tried to charge me like $40 extra per tire). Avoid.<//text>

If there were more stars to score then I'll add 5 more for a 10! They work hard to making sure your loved ones are covered. A special thanks to Martha for providing care on emergency bases. Some of us don't have family to show up while us those that have love ones with disabilities and having to work. So hats down to this company, its a true blessing to being a part of the Cambrian Homecare services that they provide.<//Review>

Some of the staff at the front desk are extremely rude and they don't know their job very well. Never gives people time to speak before transferring or putting on hold, then being placed on hold for over 15 minutes.
Other than front desk infan say inhave had an awesome interaction with the employees, especially Susan, hope i spelled that correctly.<//Text>

<review>This is not a good agency. Caregivers are always canceling. Office has a high turnover. They are NOT ORGANIZED at all. Most of the caregivers are not properly trained. They act as if they do not know what to do and they wait around for the client to ask them to do something. They should just go in and do thier job. Some go in and do thier homework. Some sit on the phone all day. There was a time when one caregiver took child to work with her. SMH.< /review><Name>Linda TERRELL</Name>< pics>

This company hires caregivers that outright steal from  their clients. If I could give them zero stars I would! A caregiver came to our home and stole thousands of dollars worth of jewelry and Cambrian did nothing to investigate and reprimand this horrible caregiver. They cannot be trusted! Don't trust the care of your vulnerable loved ones to this agency! Look elsewhere.< /Text>

<review>This company needs to get checked. They keep saying I don’t have hours when I know I do cuz I keep count. Someone is stealing money from this company. They don’t even pay the right amount. 12 dollars per hour.  All the rules from this company is not right. I’ll be considering telling my boss (the person I work for) to change agency’s. Please don’t waist your time applying at Cambrian. They really don’t help you at all. Soon they will be sued by me and other people as well.<//review><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

<Text>Very low hours, very low pay for what you do. I do not recommend this job. I had a client I worked 8 hours for Cambrian sent me a voicemail saying my client had run out of hours for that day, and I was not aware or warned about, and they were NOT gonna pay me for my 8 hour shift. I don’t think it’s fair or professional they really need to step it up and be involved more with the caregivers.<//Text>< pics>

I thought this was a good company to work for,  until i realized they are greedy and only care about themselves. They push " love " your job, the clients and people. Be gentle, understanding and kind yet they aren't any of those things.

I went to training, 2 days, paid all my fees to be in the class. I took the test, passed and they emailed me for orientation. Orientation was on saturday. Friday night i went to the ambulance in a ER and missed my orientation. I called monday morning after my boyfriend explained to me he forgot to call friday.

I called ROSE YOON. thats her name. explained to her what happened and told her I have proof I was in the ER. she told me she would call me back or email me.

she emailed me back and said I no longer qualified to work there because  I missed orientation. So you're telling me I've been doing training, and waiting to work for a month just for me to be disqualified  because I was ILL?

How do you try to teach us compassion and turn around and not even care what I was going through? never once asked. I knew right there its about money with them.

Don't apply with them.<//Review>

After three years of being a recipient of the service we have learned a lot about Cambrian. We had a lot of trouble with their caregivers. One caregiver worked for us for two years. We, as the recipient of the service, are accountable. The caregivers themselves were not very accountable. Good caregiving is really hard work but most of the caregivers from Cambrian weren't good at their job with little or no experience. A few were argumentative and menacing. Good caregivers are not being paid enough or being given enough hours to make the transportation time, if on the bus, around the city sustainable. Travel time should be compensated. Cambrian is not accountable to us, as the recipient, or to the caregiver. They read the notes they have taken regarding our account to the caregiver. Do not expect privacy laws to followed by the staff at Cambrian. Largely. Cambrian fails in their duties of communicating to either recipient or caregiver. Misundetstandings happened alot because of this and Cambrian always blamed someone else for any misunderstanding.Overall, at the most vulnerable time when you need real caregivers Cambrian provides questionable service. If you have to use them go ahead and lock up your valuables. Don't expect the workers to be good at caregiving. Double check all communication between you and the caregiver. Don't leave your home unattended with the caregiver and the recipient. We were told by a coordinator at Cambrian that we weren't to trust any of their caregivers. Cambrian will blame the recipient for mistakes that their service provides. If this is a for profit company all of their resources are going into the pockets of the owners and not to the job of providing a good homecare service. It also seems as if the staff at their offices are overworked as well. This is our experience and a little advise.
Update: Cambrian entered a false statement into our medical records accusing us of having animal feces all over our floor. There is no truth to that accusation. Cambrian has proven to be completely inadequate as a provider of quality homecare services. And apparently if you complain about their services, as we did, they have no problem retaliating against you. Stay away from this home care agency.
Update: We were advised by our medical provider to try Cambrian one more time. Cambrian sent a caregiver, we believe, to catch us at something. APS was called, we don't know what the accusation was this time, but it was good because authorities could see that there was no truth to the accusations however Cambrian seems to be harassing us.We've complained and Cambrian didn't like that. If you don't have to use Cambrian Homecare service...don't. They don't help and have caused harm.</Review>

We have been with Cambrian for over 25 years. They always work hard to cover the hours we request. Their staff and caregivers have always been friendly and courteous. We can leave our adult disables daughter home knowing she's is good hands without worry.<//review>

<Text>One of the worst Respite companies! A relative of mine had their services for over 6 months and their staff and office personnel are the worst! It is so sad they only care about the money they earn. Their employees are not trained at all in fact some of them just came to "work" and only sat down and watched the family of the client do the work. That never volunteered to assist. They obviously do not know their work duties and expectations. Their scheduling department is the worst, both Veronica and Gloria are no help, they do not do anything about their employees not doing their work. When employees are constantly calling off they don't hesitate to do anything. Worst company ever. I made a written complaint with both the state and regional center. Companies like this one don't hire the experienced staff to assist families with special needs members.< /Text><pics>None<//pics>< rating>

Very unprofessional and I will be summiting a grievance.  My time and money were wasted. I am a very compassionate human. I wasn't notified at all by cambrian that I was not scheduled today to see my client. I was taken off my schedule and went to my client, and was sent home. I WAS NOT NOTIFIED THAT I WAS TAKEN OFF MY SCHEDULE M-F 1PM TO 4PM. THIS IS UNFORTUNATE!!!!!The team does not show commitment to employees and the communication is not up to par. Hr was notified by me upon me emailing my doctors note for being sick with the flu. Karina has said to ignore me and may call me back when she feels like it. I'm very disappointed as my hours are less then 10. People have BILLS to pay. I deserve respect as a caregiver because I work so hard. Finding a new position now. This is sad. I've worked here leas than a year. This is the way they treat employees.  Will not refer anyone here!< /Review>

<Response>None< /Response><review>Worst agency ever. If you have a problem they wont resolve it they only care about your money. And some child care providers (melody smith) lie about the hours they provide (add more hours) and you end up paying alot more. I called the office (kate:service coordinator) to talk about the hours and she didnt resolve anything. She said if we have prove about the hours. If im oaying for a service i expect them to be honest, i dont want to babysit them abd chexk everything they do. But dont get me wrong not all the caregivers are bad.</review>< time>

Hiring a caregiver 101. Due diligence! Caregivers are givers of care, not dealers of cash. The bare bones salary is below living wages for most people. Consider our pay a supplement to care for the family we have to support as well. That said KNOW YOUR NEEDS! Do you tell the agency exactly what you want from  your special needs caregiver?
Here's my list.
Speak English.
Safty first CPR First aid certification
Self starter
Critical thinker
Transporter
Medical assistance
Energetic
Light to medium housework EVERY TIME
No cell phone compulsives please
Kind and patient
Reliable
Do you think that for $10.50 an hour you will find all that? I'm going to say "meh" but you have a chance of finding it at Cambrian. My experience with the company has been extremely positive. If your looking for a permanent solution,  check everywhere.  Even Craig's list. Caregivers are primarily independent contractors. We enjoy flexibility, the ability to pick and choose. While you evaluate us we are evaluating you. Does your house look like an episode of Horders?!? Does it wreak of dirty diaper and rotton food? Do you provide such little support for the caregiver as to insist all parties involved are to remain trapped inside the filthy mess of your life the entire length of stay. Not even fresh air or clean surroundings?
Seriously? Many families are in a huge amount of need. I get it, my mom is 82 and I care for her as well. Cambrian respite is wonderful if you know how to manage them. Make a list, check it twice. The State pays for most of our salary, (imagine a more cold and distant employer.) The staff at Cambrian works hard to find a good fit for  your needs. As far as my experience they will not stop until you are taken care of. We have work ethic and are proud of our work. It is the commitment to care that is shared up the chain of command.
So before you judge take a deep breath, is the plank in your eye so large you can not see the sliver in your Caregivers? Yes, some of us even have morals, standards and ethics that are at least as high as yours.  Like your loved one, we have feelings too. Most of us love what we do, it is our essence. Please try not to stamp out our fire. We're the ones who will be wiping your bottoms. Cambrian is quality care, excellent service and most are professional. I am also a CNA with vast experience in Geriactric and Devopmental special needs care. I work with all types of tramatic brain Injury. Gourmet cook,life skills coach etc. Good luck and don't forget to include Cambrian on your search for the perfect caregiver. BTW be prepared because someone with the qualifying experience you want usually starts at $15.00 to  $20.00 an hour thought a private source and more for an agency.<//review>

Absolutely delicious, i was on the run so i only got the wrapped grape leaves and the Gyro sandwich. Both very delicious. But for sure next time I'll order a bigger meal for more to enjoy. The restaurant was clean and decorated so quaint, the people were so kind and respectful, and the smell from the cooking was causing me to drool.💜🍽 Can't wait to come back!</Review>

Soda was dirty. I asked the waitress to change it and she was not happy. The next drink was dirty too. I decided to eat my food without a drink! The saffron rice tasted like burned bread. And the supposedly lamb kabob was definitely not lamb. It was beef kabob. This is from almost a year ago. They may have other chefs. I have never been there since then and I'm not planning to, anytime soon.<//review>

We had this Togo. The chicken, flank steak , were tasty grilled goodness. Seasoned just right with quality meat. The ground beef consistent in flavor. Out of the three, the chicken and steak were the best. The basmati rice fluffy and nice. Served with grilled whole tomato and jalapeno. Bottom line, the food is simplistic in form and good. $$. As always  explore wherever  your travels take you...</text>

<Text>Exceptionally great food, friendly service, and lovely food presentation! Impressed with new ownership and subtle changes that make it unique to Betty's. We're previous loyal patrons of George's but are certainly happy to have Betty in town. Fresh tasty hummus pairs well with an aromatic Perisan salad over thin bread. I enjoyed a hearty plate of lentil soup which I devoured as my main dish. Spouse ordered the combo plate with chicken and beef kabobs that he thoroughly enjoyed. Servings sizes are generous, bring your appetite, or even share with a friend. Our server was charming, efficient (water glasses ALWAYS filled), and had a nice sense of humor. We are big Fans of Betty's and would highly recommend to anyone looking for a great meal in town!<//Text>< user_id>

<text>I was very hungry on my way to Bay Area. I found this place and ordered Chicken wrap. Tasted Ok. Chicken and veggies didn’t seem like it was fresh. Wrapping was done nicely so that nothing would fall off.</text>< user_name>

Just had my first visit here today. The owner was so welcoming and hospitable. Plenty of serving with the koobideh plate that I ordered; fit for two meals for me. The basmati rice was so sublime! I'm planning on giving them a phone call directly to place my take away order again very soon!<//Review>

Welll, let me start off by saying I absolutely love quality, let me repeat, quality Persian food. I have traveled hours to go to the Bay or Sac to get something decent. We stumbled on this place looking for something that wasn't packed due to it being Valentine's day and all. Ok let me also mention I’m Middle Eastern myself and KNOW good quality ethnic food.
We called to see if they are open for dine in and the woman who answered the phone was so so pleasant. Very welcoming. So we get there, nice family owned restaurant. Very quaint. The beautiful Persian music was playing. We ordered our food and sat down to eat. I have no words to describe how happy I am to FINALLY have a GREAT Persian restaurant close enough to frequent regularly. The food was superb. The kubede kabab was amazing. My husband ordered the steak and chicken kabob combo. Holy smokes. I was blown away. We ordered two more dishes to go for dinner.  I want to try everything on the menu. Oh and how can I forget to mention the Baklava!!!! YUMMMM. I had to write this review quickly so people can spread the word. Lets support this amazing spot.</Text>

<Review>The food is really superb very flavorful. I hope the owner will change the name of the restaurant because most of us thought it's just a typical American burger place but in fact they serve Excellent Mediterranean food. I will definitely come back here.</Review>< Pics>

<Review>The food here is homemade and just delicious! Particularly if you are a little adventurous with your palate or if you are partial to Mediterranean food. We had a yogurt, herb and rice soup that was just great. Of course we had the lamb and chicken kebabs and the cabbage dolmas. The owner Betty is a doll. We will be back soon!!!<//Review>< gmapID>

<user_name>Eilo Betoushana<//user_name><date>1567224555898</date><Rate>5<//Rate><review>I'm now on keto, I live in Tracy and it looks like I'll be making frequent trips to Betty's in the near future. Earlier today I told my wife that I was craving Kabobs and I really wanted to feast but didn't want to spend a bunch of money at a sit down nor did I want to fire up the grill and go through that hassle of making kabobs. A couple weeks back we passed Betty's after church but I was in a rush to get home but the smell of the Kabobs were stuck in my head since then. I called them up today and a lovely lady picked up the phone and I ordered 2 koobideh dinner plates, a skewer of tomatos, 5 skewers of koobideh and 1 skewer of chicken breasts. Let me tell you they like to add roasted jalapenos on the side for free which was an awesome bonus. All of this for less than $60!!!!! I gave them $60 and an extra $10 as tip. This much food would be well over $100 anywhere else. The owners were extremely hospitable and accommodating. I told them I would be cutting it close to their closing time and they said no worries and they waited for me. I don't think I'll ever make Kabobs at home anymore. I'll be using Betty's from now on for all my events. This is a must go to for Keto meats.< /review>< pictures>

Fantastic! A 10+. Food is cooked and prepared perfect! The staff, as sweet as can be. The chicken kabob, prefect, and the rice, yes please. The Baklava, save room to have a piece, and to bring some home. A must to visit. Betty is SO sweet!< /text>

I'd add photos if the food had survived more than a few minutes haha. Overall the food we had was fantastic. Pita is great, gyro wraps are delicious and large for $7.99 (if you're getting your food to-go I'd get an extra taziki sauce), and the hummus appetizer is an amazing value. Delicious garlicy hummus with tons of pita bread to eat it with. Definitely worth a visit if you're a fan of Mediterranean food!< /text>

We had a great experience at Bettys Kabob today! The young waiter was very friendly and obviously wanted us to have a good experience there. The food was exceptional. They make everything from scratch I believe,  so it does take longer to fix than fast food,  but it was worth the wait. Go when you have time to relax and enjoy the experience. We definitely plan to return.<//review>

We started with Cabbage Dolma and Hummus and were full when our lunches arrived. Cynthia took home her Greek Salad, but I tried to eat the Chicken Kabob Sandwich. Everything was so delicious, but I ate way too much.

<review>The lady at the counter was very nice and friendly. She made a suggestion on what was good and I like it very much. Later she came to the table and checked up on me and how the meal was. The food was great for the price and I would take my friends there to try it as well. The place was clean and a nice atmosphere. Well worth giving the five stars.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

I got some food to go. food was not good. Ordered a chicken kabob with rice. Chicken had little to no flavor. The rice tasted really earthy and was not good. I had to throw it all away. Other places in town with similar food but way better.</review>

The food is amazing, however the service is so bad that it kinda sucked the flavor out of the food. Me and my cousin went there to celebrate me getting a new job and it took over an hour for our food to get ready. We tried to ask for a refund and the cook lost her temper with us and dared to give us attitude! She was like well geeze thanksssss! What am I gonna do with all this food, and we said is been way over an hour. She said I am alone in the kitchen today. And we said that's why we were considerate but to a limit. How is that out fault? Then I told my cousin well if the food is ready we will just eat it because I don't want to waste food but she had it in to go boxes when were dinning in. We just took it to end the fight, but it really left us feeling bitter, unwanted, and a burden which is no way for a customer to feel. However the food was actually good I just wish we had a better experience.</text>

One of my favorite places in Modesto. Only gave it 4 stars because I'm used to a thicker and more robust tzazaki sauce & I don't think they salt their meat. The hummus is so good! Pita bread is so fresh. Really delicious affordable Mediterranean.<//Review>

This is Betty’s Kabob now, not George’s Burger yet this page has combined the two.  Betty’s Kabob is delicious!!!  We have enjoyed the gyro sandwich, chicken barg, flap meat kabob, koobideh, and lentil soup.  Got to sample the new falafel recipe, too!  Mmm.  Great family, great service, and delicious food!!!!< /Text>

Giant burger.  Needs more sauce and a thinner cheese. Also helps to put fixing on top of the meat so the bottom of bun isn't mush in the 5 minutes it took me to get home also decent portion of fries but under cooked I'd rather waiting 3 more minutes and receive fries that are fully cooked. was a disappointment.</Review>

The burgers rival.any of those from big chain stores. The other food available make you want to try them instead. So my son had the gyro's and I had the burger with some if the tastiest fry's (unsalted), for those if us with high blood pressure.< /review>

It has great hamburgers, not greasy and very filling. Its under new ownership and moved on the other side of town. They also have Bakalava and Giros. So you know I'll be going back.<//Text>

I had the vegaterian platter. Highly reccomend.  My husbsnd loves the burgers too and he is picky.  I like that the falafel, hummus and dolmas were made from scratch. Very enjoyable and inexpensive.</Text>

Not your average burger joint.  Walk in and... Opa!  It is actually a Mediterranean restaurant!  Authentic Mediterranean dishes along side great burger options.  Order at the counter, family-owned segment.  Great service.  Great prices.  The Pepperjack & Jalopeno burger had a perfectly grilled, quality patty.  Sitting in a freshly toasted bun with grilled, fresh jalopenos, cheese and tomatoes/lettuce/bbq sauce... plus a side of fries to boot.  A QUALITY burger.  Portions more than par for the segment.  Prices a little less than par.  A well earned 5-stars in this competitive segment.</Text>

I had an excellent experience at this location today. The staff went above and beyond to fulfill my needs, big shout out to Raven & Eli for going the extra mile to take care of me. Ive never purchased a new phone in such a short amount of time, it was so easy and painless. The store itself was clean, and pristine. I’m relieved to have found a store I know I can count on for my future needs. I would give this store 10 stars if I could. Thanks a bunch Raven!< /review>

I had to return it and was charged a restocking fee:( with no free watch :( .

Robyn was so wildly helpful! Long story short, my fiancé and I just moved and we needed to get Internet for our new home. We came in knowing zilch and was set up quick and easily by Robyn! I specifically felt compelled to leave a review because Robyn was so personable and easy going! Thanks again North Park AT&T!<//text>

She was very patient, explained everything in detail, and answered all of my questions (there were many). She is extremely knowledgeable. Often times my experiences at branches are awful, the reps are trying to sell me, they aren’t very knowledgeable, and they say the price is one thing at the store and then my bill always shows otherwise/increases. I usually hate going in person, but I’m so glad to find a location where I don’t feel taken advantage or given misinformation. Raven gives great customer service, I felt confident and comfortable making changes to my account. It’s nice to encounter honest people! I recommend going to this location and working with Raven.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>{'time': 1611684691118, 'text': 'Hi Brijette Martin. Thank you for the awesome review!

<Review>Went to this location today and was very impressed with my service. Raven was very friendly, helpful and very informative. I had purchased the new iPhone 12 Max and 2 IPhone 11s. I wish every time I had to go into the store my service was as great as it was today. I’m beyond impressed with Raven and how well she handled all my needs with all my phones. Thank you so much Raven if you see this stay sweet and keep being amazing I appreciate you!!!! 😁</Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

Came in on a Sunday long line as expected, but the store manager Ravyn, kicked but and got us all through quick. Coming in with a broken phone she helped us out getting a spanking new iPhone 12 📱 and helped us out with getting the old one fixed. Even steered us to someone that could fix my broken watch. Great customer service that always goes along way even if your coming in with a broken phone and getting bad news. I want to give a huge shout out to Ravyn!!! She was great!!! will definitely be coming back to get help with my phone issues. Thanks again!!<//Review>

<text>The customer service at this store is amazing!! I’ve had many experiences with different at&t stores and this one was by far the best. I was serviced by Julie and Raven who helped me out so much. They were very thorough in explaining everything to me ensuring I was getting the best deal. They answered all my questions making me feel 100% satisfied and confident in my choices. They were very kind and sweet as well. I did spent a good amount of time in the store, but they made sure I was comfortable the whole time. I’m also impressed how they were able to help others customers at the same time but still being very attentive to me. I loved the team work between these two!

Not very good customer service! Literally one person working and just chit chatting with 3 other people waiting and the reception I got when I walked in was like, “great another one. Well hope you are ready to wait!” And the technician continued to slowly chit chat. I understand being overwhelmed and being the only one working - that’s fine and I salute anyone who handles those situations but be courteous to others who are patiently waiting.<//text>

<Review>I never thought I would write a review for a phone/cable company but here we are. My fiancé and I recently moved to the area and had a lot of trouble trying to get our internet set up in our new home. We tried multiple times online and over the phone to get everything set up but they actually hung up on us which was incredibly frustrating. We came to our local AT&T location and I am so glad we did. Ravyn was able to get everything set up for us and made the process so easy. She was so friendly and even made the on hold/waiting time enjoyable. We will definitely be returning here for any future cable/internet/cell phone needs!< /Review>< Pics>

Came in to upgrade my phone, Ravyn helped me happily and thoroughly. Julie came in shortly after to help the process as well and the two of them made it an easy and fun transition. Toward the end a man came in and caused a scene by not leaving after Ravyn kindly asked multiple times. I thought her and Julie handled the situation so calmly and professionally after this man was being rude in the store. Happy to have come here and support this team that cares about their job and customers.</Review>

<rate>1<//rate><Review>Watch out for no disclosure of expensive add-ons to bump up the associates commission!

I went in to setup a new cell phone plan. The whole experience was odd as I never received any sort of receipt or confirmation for what I signed up for. When pressed I was told everything would be emailed later and my monthly cost would be approx $75.

I got really nervous and uncomfortable about the whole scenario and spoke with customer service the next morning. The associate had lied to me and signed me up for $20+ in monthly fees beyond the plan cost. The customer rep said that this was likely because they get a commission. For example the in-store rep said they enroll everyone in the highest level unlimited cell plan as they were all the same price (not true I confirmed with rep over phone). I also specifically stated no insurance as I was going to buy a nice case, but of course I was signed up for additional insurance.

I suggest avoiding the store rep and doing things over the phone. Over the phone the guy even waived the activation fee. Good luck.< /Review>< pics>

<review>I have been having an impossible time over the phone trying to transfer a business account to a personal one, and then adding a line.  Sounds simple, but it was really challenging over the phone, so I decided to go to this location for help.  Thank goodness for EJ, as he worked with me over two different visits and was patient, helpful, and somehow helped about 3 people at once in any given time.  FINALLY, we completed the transaction and the goals were met!  Though this company is insanely huge and bureaucratic (especially between the business and consumer sides), I will always handle my AT&T business here.< /review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

Ravyn and EJ encountered several issues with my transfer from Verizon to AT&T. But they dealt with each problem in a professional and expedited fashion. I understand dealing with difficult situations that are out of your control are stressful but they did a great job. Thank you!< /Review>

Raven helped our entire family converting all of our lines. She was very patient and went above & beyond to make sure we got what we needed.

E.J is very helpful & makes only beneficial suggestions that helps you out in the long run.

< Review>
I went in the store in the evening. Ej was by himself and there were quite a few people waiting. He was welcoming and let me know that it could be a long wait which it did end up being like a 2 hour wait. Anyways EJ was very nice and so is the store manager who I spoke with the next day because I needed help logging in. I would recommend this store because they were super helpful and very nice to work with.</Review>

Ravyn helped me so much. She was incredibly friendly and knowledgeable and got me out of the store quickly (which is always really appreciated). I have NEVER had such a SEAMLESS experience at atnt. so I felt the need to let everyone know.< /Text>

Abraham was very helpful and answered all of my questions with succinct answers. He assisted with setting up the phone, helping me make choices for additional accessories and completed the transaction smoothly. I have recommended him to my husband who will also be purchasing an iPhone 11Pro. Thank you ATT and Abraham!< /text>

They do not have a kiosk for self service bill paying, and their system is a bit slow when checking into accounts, paying Bill's etc.  Of course that's not the fault of the staff who's always been great every time I visit.< /Review>< Pictures>

<Text>I kept hearing people praising the fast speeds and reasonable price for U-verse so I decided to go for it. After failing to be able to set it up online or by calling the main sales number, I decided to head to this store. Chris & Ed were ready to help and Chris started the process. There was an issue processing my account that required them calling a division of AT&T that was closed on Sundays, so they picked it up on Monday. Chris was off, and without skipping a beat, Ed took right over. He was able to determine what actions I needed to do and I did them. Chris took back over the next day and the order was in! Install was yesterday and it is amazing! Great job AT&T!<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None<//response>< Gmap_id>

If you buy a phone from these folks reset the time on your phone. It will be incorrect if you dont. And you will also have no voice mail icon on your home screen because they feel its not needed. Pretty much a bunch of degenerates work here for AT&T which is a very shady company.<//Review>

If there was a no star option. This place is a horrible business. Illegally refuses cash payments. The manager does not care to help customers. The entire staff behaves as though they do not know their job. This establishment should be closed for business.< /text>

I been here 4 times already and those 4 times I came out with new phones since I added my family members to my line. I really recommend going to this store, I had gone to att in Plazabonita and their customer service sucked, so it feels good to find a store where I actually always feel welcome and care for! I will be back to this store and now i know where to go to get my service done! GREAT MANAGER!!!!!<//Review>< Gmap_id>

<Text>HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE !! THE STORE MANAGER SAVANNA AMES SOLD ME A PRODUCT THAT WAS BROKEN. I RETURNED THE PRODUCT THE NEXT DAY TO THE STORE AND COULD NOT RECEIVE A REFUND. SHE SAID THE PRODUCT THAT WAS SOLD TO ME WAS PREVIOUSLY OPENED BY ANOTHER CUSTOMER AND THAT ITS NOT HER FAULT FOR THE BROKEN EQUIPMENT.  I ASKED WHY WOULD YOU SELL ME SOMETHING THAT HAD ALREADY BEEN OPEN BY SOMEONE ELSE AND SHE DID NOT RESPOND. SHE SHOULD BE FIRED IMMEDIATELY OR THIS STORE LOCATION SHOULD BE CLOSED INDEFINITELY.</Text>< pics>

I got scammed at this store! Some young man talked me into renewing my contract, promising me an additional 20% off a month. It never happened and know i'm stuck in a 2 year contract paying way more than I should. ATT is expensive compared to all other new offers out there. ATT customer service is a HUGE joke.<//Text>

One person working meant we had a line but he was a pro at his job. Clean store with AC. 2 hour free parking in their lot is gold for the area so you can hit North Park after you sort out your phone.<//Review>

Went to pay my bill and guess what..... They don't have change to give me. They asked me to go to the store or bank to get change. LOL...... What kind of business AT&T is running.<//review>

One person working meant we had a line but he was a pro at his job. Clean store with AC. 2 hour free parking in their lot is gold for the area so you can hit North Park after you sort out your phone.< /review>

(Translated by Google) Great service! My lawyer secretly gave me an AT&T service phone number and it works 100%, now I will call my people to start doing business by the time I escape I will be the Chief of all.

<Review>The owners are rude af! They need to learn how to be respectful so people want to come back to shop. Other than that their employees are nice and professional and their clothing is on point.  Also i understand that fitting rooms are closed due to covid but they should make exceptions on final sale merchandise like be able to get store credit..< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

The place itself is beautiful and very clean. The atmosphere of the studio made me feel very comfortable and excited about my new art. I will definitely be returning here!! If I could give the entire experience more than five stars, I would.< /Review>< Pics>

Beto did an amazing job of bringing my idea to reality! After a year of rescheduling (literally) because of the pandemic, I was able to get in and get this piece done. Thank you so much!<//text>

<review>I've been seeing June for a few years now (both while she was in NYC and now at her new studio in Los Angeles).  She is AMAZING!!  She's done my half-sleeve on my left arm and my entire right sleeve, which is still a work in progress.  I get stopped on the street or in the gym all the time because people want to talk about my tattoos. June's watercolor effect, and her creativity, are world-class.  She's so easy to collaborate with and her work is so original.  I couldn't be happier as a client (as evident by the fact that I keep coming back to see her over and over and over again).  If you like original, one-of-a-kind, world-class tattoos, with a touch of watercolor effect, book time with June!</review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOQjN7ZHY0Db7eH_3R-zbhioOSrKWs80QlXXUO-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOW2ytAtfmElPH3R2kkb9fEZvhmpOUftv4pLeGJ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOtzPprIp8Boefp8NAZMvRWy2jf78WqClQTMEzP=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNXU4imYHJwoIT17EK7a6A4-sAXd8L0X_tSzkvI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPQV2XZHoY18QHZMb3fVLg_NDBaWcdMmE99te9Q=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPiUHUu2tBhCqMIlG9XhL1Os6SzvYklk5iFbVt3=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics><resp>{'time': 1510188234232, 'text': 'Thank you so much, Joe!

just got a new piercing (helix) and a re-opening of an old one (rook) by helena. she was so nice and VERY patient with me. the receptionist was also very sweet and greeted us and everyone that came in after us. helena kept me notified of when she would be able to assist with jewelry and pricing. when it was our turn she was very sweet,  professional and helpful. helena, thanks for answering all my stupid questions... i was a little nervous and all over the place. will definitely be back!</Review>

I cannot say better things about June's artistry! I have a 3/4 floral sleeve that was done by June in February and I am ALWAYS getting compliments on my tattoo wherever I go. June's meticulous attention to detail while maintaining a very natural style is amazing.
I chose June for my tattoo as I was looking to get a watercolor styled tattoo and I was not disappointed!
She was courteous and accommodating the whole session and I can't wait to go back for more already. They also provided clear and detailed instructions on tattoo aftercare and my tattoo healed up in a little over a week.
I'm still blown away by the vivid colors and artwork of my sleeve everyday.

If you are thinking about getting a tattoo with watercolor styles, I would recommend June any day! But be patient because she is usually booked due to demand, the wait is definitely worth it!
Thanks again, June and Rob!< /Review>

<rating>5<//rating><Text>I've been getting tattoos for 17 years and have sat dozens of times. I've been to working class street shops and glitzy parlors catering to fancy clientele.

My experience at June Jung Art was by far the most relaxing and enjoyable first time experience I've had. The shop is clean and well maintained. June and Rob are warm and welcoming.

In addition to the shop experience the tattoo quality is amazing. I sent an idea to June and when I came into the shop she had three different versions of the design ready for me. We had a quick conversation about which I preferred, and decided on color -- all without stress or pressure.

June is fantastic at what she does. The tattoo was the least painful I've experienced, placement is perfect, and it healed without a hitch.

I would absolutely recommend June to anyone -- in fact, I received a number of compliments just walking around the city in the days following. Every time it came up I immediately referred them to June's studio.<//Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMbaqWjUTIh5SqNHM9_1I5-RoGEyqU7cX0mkBIA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures><Response>{'time': 1512611038613, 'text': 'It was great experience for me as well to see you in 10 years!

My experience with June and Rob was a fantastic experience from start to finish. June's art speaks for itself, and I am thrilled to have her work tattooed. The shop is clean, relaxing, and a work of art on its own. The consultation, scheduling, and day of the appointment was simple, accommodating, effortless, and fun! The tattoo is simply amazing, and is my favorite from the three I have. I even appreciated how she incorporated touches of my mom's flowers and hand-made jewelry, as well was able to tattoo both me and my wife on the same day.

There are very few 5 star experiences in my book, and June is one of them!<//Text>

< Review>
June is an incredible artist with such a beautiful and unique style! I am so grateful to rock three of her original paintings (photos attached). Booking with Rob was quick and super convenient. Her shop is extremely clean and comfortable.

June took the time to listen to my concerns in terms of placement. She took pictures of my preferred body placements and then applied the digital image of the sketch against each placement to show me exactly how the tattoo would look on my actual skin.

For me, placement is key as the tattoo needs to flow with the contours of the body. June's fine lines and color application skills are unmatched. You won't be disappointed!

<Rate>5< /Rate><Review>I reached out to June's studio after losing one of my best friends. I wanted a tattoo that reflected two of the things we loved best...cats and books. The design process was great. I sent June, and her husband Rob who helps manage the business, a series of "look books" of images that gave a sense of what I was looking for in a watercolor tattoo. When I arrived for my session, I sat with June and she unveiled her design. I was instantly in love. I'll admit I was nervous showing up for a tattoo of a design I hadn't seen yet. But as a writer I completely get the process. My nervousness was completely dispelled when I saw how perfectly June had translated my many images into a single, perfect vision. The shop is lovely. The people are lovely. And the whole process was as painless as a tattoo can be. But more than anything I am so impressed with June's artistry. The detail is amazing! I very highly recommend June and her studio.</Review>< Pictures>

June is a TOTAL BADASS! And an amazing artist! I had dreamed of getting a cardinal tattoo for the longest time and as soon as I saw her artwork I knew she was the perfect artist for me. The meaning had such deep sentimental value for me I was almost nervous to get it done at all, but it turned out more perfect that I could have imagined. The wait time for my consultation was faster than I expected and she even managed to fit me in for the tattoo before she had a baby!! Did I mention she was adorably freaking pregnant when she did my tattoo. So awesome! Artwork-Perfect, Atmosphere-Clean & Serene, Price-100% reasonable and exactly what I expected
I recommend this shop to everyone👍🏽❤️🎉✌🏽<//Review>

This was my first tattoo and I really didn’t know what to do or how to start. I simply emailed June with some simple thoughts and what I wanted. Her and Rob emailed me back with some follow up information about the cost and other details.

We setup a consultation for just a couple weeks later. From the consultation during the actual appointment date I was so comfortable. I chatted with Rob during most of my tattoo and June was great about walking me through the process. You know... it did hurt, but only some. June put plenty of numbing spray on it and knocked it put in only 4 hrs! I was blown away with how great the piece came out. When she did the final contrast shading it all hit me with the feels. I loved seeing this amazing piece turn out.

I cannot wait to get more done by her. Her work isn’t cheap, but she is more than worth it! You get what you pay for and she could easily charge more.

She has some great original pieces and hopefully I can get one of those also.

Great work, great vision, so worth it! Thank you June!  ❤️❤️</Review></record></dataset><record>

<Gmap_id>0x80c2c1510b446465:0xc474c796b47d40db</Gmap_id><review>I got in touch with June Jung Art purely through social media and that's how I discovered them. I was visiting LA for a little over a month and was able to book a few consultations and finally an appointment to get a start on a tattoo I've been hoping to get for awhile now.

I worked with Beto as my tattoo artist. He's kind and good to work with. We had some difficulties in the beginning figuring out some detail work of my tattoo, but I'll take the blame for not having a completely clear vision on what I wanted when I walked in. In the end we decided to just work on the main body of the tattoo art first, and perhaps re-visit the tattoo again at a later time.

The work that I did get done turned out BEAUTIFULLY. I am so happy with how it turned out. The detailed fine line work wasn't easy for Beto but he rocked it out.

Robert, June's husband, was always very good at communicating with me and helping me set up times to come in for consultations and finally my tattoo appointment.

Even if you aren't in their LA area - the drive to their studio is absolutely worth it. I highly recommend!<//review></record>

<Rate>5< /Rate><review>First, I have to start by saying that this was my first tattoo EVER. It was a memorial tattoo in honor of my father, who I lost over the summer. So I was nervous, excited and very picky about who put this on my body.

Second, everything about my experience here was wonderful! A) booking an appointment was easy-breezy, Rob (June's husband) was quick to respond and to correspond any questions I had with the artist, Beto.

Third, Beto was amazing. Quite, soft spoken, and patient. Made any and all changes to my piece on the spot. The tattooing process was quick, easy and he has what I would imagine a "light hand", because the pain was pretty minor. And I couldn't be happier with the finished product!! The lines are clean and so delicate, and the pieces came out perfect :)</review>< pics>

I was giddy after being on June's wait list and hearing that I would have the opportunity to work with her.

The shop is so aesthetically pleasing. The natural light bounces off the bright walls and the windows give it a modern feel.

Everyone at the shop is genuinely excited to be there. Rob and June were very easy to speak and work with through the whole process, even as I came from out of state for the piece.

I will cherish this piece forever (obviously) and I am still speechless by June's proficiency in art as a whole. Thank you for making this memorial, beautiful.</Text>

June is amazing! Great artist, the details on her tattoos are amazing. It really is having a beautiful pairing on your skin. She’s very sweet and light with her hands. I felt very relaxed with her as she was tattooing me. Love my tattoo so much!

She’s the best! Can’t go to any other artist but her.<//text>

<text>My husband and I just got our first tattoos from June. I can’t say enough about what an incredible artist she is and tatooer. Her details, lines, subtlety are impeccable. The shop is sparkly clean and beautiful as well. Rob and staff were great to work with and so professional. We are so thrilled to have her original art forever.</text><gmapID>0x80c2c1510b446465:0xc474c796b47d40db< /gmapID>< userid>

The ‘June Jung’ Studio is probably the most professional studio I have ever seen.
Everybody was super nice and helpful.
Communication worked flawlessly.
But most importantly, Hemi, the Artist, did such a fantastic job.
Hemi not only immediately understood the idea behind what I wanted (even though I provided 2 very different types of sketches) but she made the draft and the end result so much better than I imagined!
I was truly blown away by her artistic skill. I can't thank her enough for this wonderful piece of art.
thank you!</review>

Found shop by word of mouth and then locating them online.

Originally June's work caught my eye but when I found Hemi's art work she stole my heart. Its soft, elegant and precise.

I submitted my idea and within a few days Rob emailed me and I was on my way!

Booking is easy and online. You pay an amount towards your tattoo and get a date

Parking is street parking (I didn't see a lot) but there's plenty around the shop. I parked across the street with ease

Hemi had several designed made and I liked all of them so much we collaborated to mash them together and came out with my tattoo!

Hemi is friendly, sweet, open to discussing design, even going as far as redesign on the spot via tablet (prior to tattooing)

Rob was awesome, knowledgeable and welcoming.

The entire staff was laid back and I felt incredible from the minute I walked. Will definitely be adding more and coming back!<//text>

June and Rob are both incredibly welcoming and friendly people.  The studio is clean, bright, and has a nice feeling to it.  I contacted June a few months before to schedule my appointment with a vague description of an idea and a few reference images.  What she came up with was so much better than what I had in my head.  Once we started the tattoo it was easy to relax with some music in the background.  It was a pleasure to meet them.  I would absolutely go back to June for another tattoo, her style and passion is absolutely unmatched!

Also, parking was pretty easy to find in the area.< /review>

Got my first tattoo here! I was looking for months for an artist who does watercolor tattoos well in the Los Angeles area and was about to give up and book a flight to another country when I came across June's work on Instagram. I went to a tattoo convention where there were hundreds of artists to see who else was available in the LA area. Seeing June's unique style juxtaposed with all the other artists there, I knew she was just what I was looking for!

June and Rob were super helpful and personable throughout the consultation/design process and responded quickly via email to all of my questions and requests. I gave June my concept for the design, and she took off and ran with it.

The day of the actual appointment, I was running late and didn't have time to eat beforehand. Without skipping a beat, Rob offered me and my friend that I had brought with me a selection of healthy snacks they had on hand. June and Rob did a great job of putting me at ease, knowing that I was nervous because it was my first tattoo. Also, a note about the space.... most tattoo shops are cluttered and kitschy. This place is not that. It's super open and you feel like you can actually breathe. Waaaayyyyy less stressful for someone like me who was nervous to begin with!

Here comes the best part.... the whole tattoo only took 2 hours! I've gotten a million compliments on it, and everyone is always blown away by how detailed it is. Most people assume that it took several sessions and hardly believe me when I tell them it only took 2 hours!

Tl;dr June is great.<//text>

Rob is very helpful throughout the whole process and was very quick to respond.  The shop is very clean and comfortable.  Overall, my experience was fantastic.<//Review>

Beto created a tattoo of Haku from Spirited Away for me! His style is minimalistic and modern while the owner of the shop, June, does watercolor and illustrative style tattoos. It was my first tattoo and I had an amazing experience. June Jung Art has a great aesthetic and vibe about it. Rob, June, and Beto were all very kind and I am absolutely in love with the end result.</review>

<text>Love my new artwork by June Jung!  I feel so incredibly lucky to have found her.  Literally stumbled upon her shop, looked her up on google and Instagram and I was hooked by her beautiful artistry.  Couldn’t believe it when Rob told me she had an opening the next week.   The shop is clean and well lit.  June and Rob were so friendly and welcoming which made for a great experience.  Thank you! I’ll be coming back.< /text>< Pics>

June's work is truly amazing. She approached my project with incredible verve and creativity and came up with a remarkable design that I could not have imagined in my wildest dreams.

The shop is not only in a great location, but comfortable, relaxing, and spacious as well. I also had the pleasure of meeting Rob, who assisted me with my booking. Both he and June made me feel very welcome and provided exceptional 5-star service.

It was an awesome experience, and I cannot wait for my next visit!</text>

I had a fantastic experience here!!! I will definitely be coming back for any tattoos I want in the future.

June gave me my first tattoo and my whole experience very enjoyable from start to finish.  From the consultation and communication about the appointment to the day of the appointment, everything involved in this process was easy and enjoyable.

I have known for a few years that I wanted a watercolor tattoo and after I came across her work, I knew that I wanted her to tattoo me. She does such beautiful and amazing work that just speaks for itself.

Her shop is very clean and comforting and I really appreciated the time and care that June took during our consultation. She was very patient and nice as I explained my design and made me feel like I could really take the time to tweak the design until I was really happy with it. Any suggestions that she did make were all to make sure that the tattoo could come look as good as possible.

I also love that she also took a picture of my arm and digitally placed my design on my arm so I could get an idea of what it would look like in real time.

On the day of the appointment, I was a little nervous, but June and Rob are such nice people that they really put me at ease. They answered all of my questions and made me comfortable throughout the whole process.

For the tattoo itself, June has such a light touch. I put on a numbing cream so I wouldn't be in too much pain in the beginning.  However, even when the cream wore off, it was a very tolerable experience.

This was a 10/10 experience from start to finish. I am in love with my tattoo and it has come out better than I imagined<//Text>

I just want to start by saying June exceeded any expectations I could of had .I am absolutely in love with my tattoo.I found her work on Instagram and knew instantly that I wanted my first tattoo to be done by her .I emailed her link on her website and within a day was contacted by her husband Rob who recommended we do a consultation.That really I think made the difference because I knew what I wanted just not how .The day of the consultation I walked into this great studio space with June’s art displayed .June was finishing up a tattoo at the time .Once she was done she asked about placement size and concept and started drawing away.She gave me a couple of options and worked with any input I made .We agreed on a sketch and I left my deposit and had an appointment for the actual tattoo.The best part is I left knowing that I was dealing with a true professional .Yesterday was finally the day of my first tattoo .Once June got to work  you could tell she was in her element she’s a true artist .when she finished I expected it to hurt so much more .I am so thankful to both of them they are a great duo and made my experience so great .I will definitely be going back .</Text>

<text>I am in LOVE with my new ink! June is very talented and conveyed my vision perfectly. She also works so fast and meticulously that I was in awe when the tattoo was finished.

I stumbled upon June by searching watercolor tattoo on Yelp. After reviewing her works, my decision was made. I messaged them on Yelp and got a reply from Rob within the day. The initial consultation appointment was set up via email exchanges. To help with the process, I sent some artwork/picture that are related to what I wanted to June/Rob.

During the consultation, I described what I envisioned and June did a quick sketch on her iPad with references from the artwork/picture I provided. I told her where I would want it and how big. That was pretty much it. At the end of the consultation, I scheduled the appointment for the actual tattoo.

In between the appointments, I communicated with June/Rob on further refining the idea and provided a few more pictures.

And then the big day came... when June showed me her final draft, I couldn't help but smiled from ear to ear because it was gorgeous! I knew at that instant I picked the perfect artist.< /text><userid>118105784848426552154</userid><Name>Wency Lee</Name><rate>5< /rate><Pics>None<//Pics>< Gmap_id>

I was researching a place with an artistic and unique perspective to get my first tattoo in 25 years.  I found June online, and although she was booked, I was lucky to have one of their super talented and innovative South Korean guest tattoo artists, Oddmapper, create my tattoo.  I am beyond happy with result and the incredible artistry with which he and the artists here approach tattooing.    The entire experience from a customer service standpoint was exceptional and totally pro!   They are extemely thoughtful and professional, not to mention insanely talented artists.  Their studio is stunning as well - very open and spacious and inviting with superb musical tastes in the background during the experience.  I actually cannot wait to get an appointment with June in the future for another tattoo.  Highly recommend!< /review>

Absolutely love, love my new tattoo from June! The whole process was pretty straightforward. I initially called and got my initial consultation appointment set up. Upon meeting June, she took a picture of the area that I wanted my tattoo and sketched up something really quickly to get a better idea of what I wanted. After agreeing to what I wanted, we got the actual tattooing session scheduled.

Even at the tattoo session, I was pleasantly surprised by what she came up with, and how efficient she was with tattooing the tattoo. I’m not going to lie; it was a bit painful, but I know for sure that I won’t need touch ups afterwards. I highly recommend her!<//text>

Just finished up getting my first-ever tattoo, and I gotta say the whole experience from start to finish, the initial consultation and the actual session were  incredible ! Rob and June are genuine, caring and humble people. I was a little anxious just because I had no idea what to expect, and although I had a pretty specific idea in mind of what I wanted done, I was worried I wouldn’t be able to explain or get that same idea over to an artists mind. Well with June that worry and fear diminished right away. Before I even finished fully explaining what I had in mind she had already begun drawing and incorporating her own beautiful style on an actual picture of the area on my body I had in the mind for the piece! (Talk about getting a legit preview ! ) It’s like we were on the same exact page. Any small adjustments or suggestions I had she took into consideration and altered it until I was completely happy with the work. I couldn’t stop smiling when I saw the finished picture because I had been waiting for sooooo long, years, to get my first tattoo and couldn’t believe it was a picture of something that was actually going on me.

The studio is clean, spacious, welcoming, and ridiculously calming. Chill tunes on the whole time, and felt like I was in good hands the whole time. Had my family with me at first and they felt comfortable enough to grab some drinks and food near by while waiting for my session to finish.

Thank you guys so much for making this a superb experience. I am in love with my tattoo. I know I will be stopping by again.

Hope nothing but the best for you two!< /Text>

I found Bailey on Instagram ( @needlef0x) and do not regret having her do work on my arm. I had a general idea of what I wanted, but Bailey was able to execute my vision wonderfully. Plus her vibe is excellent!! I am super stoked to continue working with her to fill out my arm!<//text>

<Text>Simply put, June is amazing. The location is clean and welcoming with plenty of street parking. When you first arrive you will talk with June about the tattoo and you can add your input for the finishing touches. She listens and makes suggestions that will bring out the best in your tattoo.

Once you are happy with your design it’s time to start the tattoo process. June has a light hand which if you are have a long session, you have sensitive skin, are nervous about the pain of a first tattoo, or you just don’t want to feel like you got beat up is an important factor to consider.

As a tattoo artist she’s one of best when it comes to watercolor and realism. She creates amazing designs that can incorporate the ideas you have for the best possible tattoo for you.< /Text>< pictures>

<text>I had such an incredible experience with June. The shop itself is beautiful and peaceful, the ideal space for getting a tattoo. June is an incredible artist. Her work is feminine, clean and above all else beautiful. Everytime I look at my forearm it makes me smile. I could not be happier with my experience. 11/10 would recommend<//text>< Pictures>

<Date>1513881933931< /Date><review>I have nothing but glowing reviews about my experience with June and Rob. From setting up a consultation, working with June on the design for my tattoo, and getting the actual tattoo itself I felt like I was in capable and professional hands. June is first and foremost an artist but I especially appreciated her ability to take my ideas and make them a reality. Her willingness to make adjustments and work with me to make me 100% satisfied with my tattoo were so appreciated. I could not be more happy with my modernized durga icon, she really made my dream come true! Thank you June!!!!! Plus you can't beat the laid back atmosphere of Rob and June's shop, felt like I was in their hyper clean and beautiful living room, equal parts comfortable, peaceful and so super clean!! Thanks for making my first big tattoo experience so amazing :)< /review><rating>5<//rating>< response>

Great experience, very accommodating. June has a wonderful studio, the stations are very clean, She and her husband were very welcoming. Take care to check your spam folder. Somehow the first of Rob's correspondence came through, but additional inquiries did not? Don't know how my e-mail filter did that. They communicated well though despite my concerns, it turned out to be an issue with my e-mail.</review>

June was so patient with me when it came to deciding the style and location of my tattoo. I am usually not such an indecisive person but for some reason it was hard for me to decide with this specific tattoo. She directed me in the right direction and I instantly fell in love with my piece when I saw it completed. I got a Korean hibiscus on my left rib area and it is BEAUTIFUL! Her work is so detailed and amazing I cant even describe in words. I was also afraid of it being super painful but it actually wasn't that bad at all. Her style is amazing!! I thought this would be my last tattoo but I am definitely going to have to come back to her for more.</text>

My entire experience with June and her studio was amazing. Her husband Rob handles business inquiries and scheduling and is always quick to respond, making it easy for me to set up a consultation and appointment. June's consultation process is great too- she took a picture of my wrist and began mocking it up on her ipad so I could see the design get fleshed out in real time.

I originally wanted a simple tattoo of my father's calligraphy, but thought it would look even better with some abstract watercolor involved. From the previous reviews on Yelp, I gathered that June would be a great fit- they said she took ideas and applied her own artistic interpretation to create beautiful tattoos. At my consultation, I talked about my idea and the mockup she drew for me in minutes was already beautiful to begin with. When I returned for my tattoo and she showed me the final design, I was blown away with how amazing it was. She took my idea and turned it into art.

10/10 would recommend June and I would love to get another tattoo from her again. Thanks for a beautiful tattoo and great experience!< /text>

June is an incredible artist and does beautiful work. I found her when she moved into our neighborhood and after seeing her instagram went in to meet her immediately. She did a small portrait of my dog that turned out incredible! Both June and Rob are friendly and professional, their studio is clean and comfortable, really you can't ask for more as far as the tattooing experience goes - from consultation to the appointment. Thank you June for a tattoo I will always treasure!</text>

Junes watercolor work are some of the best in los angeles and beto does some great black line work that stands out in the market. The only issue i have with them is that they generally have a backlog so you have to wait to get work done but that just shows the quality they work at to be in such demand.<//Review><Rate>5<//Rate></record>

First, I had my consultation with her and she was able to create a quick sketch of how the tattoo would look like. She took a picture of my shoulder blade so I could get a general idea on how it would look. Then she gave an estimate on how long the tattoo would take timewise. I liked how everything turned out, so I placed the deposit for the tattoo appointment with her. When the day came for my appointment I was a bit nervous, but her studio is really relaxing so my nerves were quickly calmed. My tattoo took about an hour and thirty minutes to complete and I love how detailed she made it. The flower is named diphylleia grayi and it's a special flower that turns transparent when it's wet from rain. She was able to make the flowers look delicate and transparent! Her watercolor skills are amazing too! I love everything about my first tattoo.</Review><gmapID>0x80c2c1510b446465:0xc474c796b47d40db</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

I got my tattoo done by Beto who blew me away with the amount of time he spent with me to perfect my first tattoo. He spent much time sitting down with me (in person) talking about the design/message I wanted to portray and turned that into a beautiful piece. Rob was also wonderful in scheduling everything and serving as the messenger between me and Beto when I had other ideas prior to my tattoo appointment. I would recommend scheduling a consultation as Beto really took his time, listening to my ideas and mocking up drafts right in front of me. Couldn't be happier with my first.
Also, it's a great location with a lot of open space and natural sunlight. Shoutouts to Rob, June, Griffin, and most importantly Beto for making me feel welcome and guiding me through my first tattoo.< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

When I went to my appointment, the place was easy to find. The studio was very clean and quiet. I met both June and Rob as well, and they were extremely kind and easy to talk to.

On to the actual tattoo! Beto was very patient and careful with the work. He was very focused and got all the small details that I had in my design. He made sure to give me time to stretch and get up for a bit (it was a 2 hour session). Also June and Rob gave me suggestions to make the tattoo even better, and it definitely did.

Overall the place was awesome. I would definitely come back for another tattoo. Everyone made the environment very friendly and inviting. I am one happy customer!

Our door dash contact was Jacklyn R. She greeted us with a smile, the food order was accurate. We recommend Jacklyn (I hope we didn't butcher your name sorry, if we did.). She has made it a pleasure to do business with Lemon Shark Poke. Thank you for the 5 star service!</Text>

Delicious poke bowls. With lots of toppings to choose from. Prices are reasonable and staff friendly. Paid around $17 for a large poke bowl, fountain drink and two egg rolls.< /review>

<Time>1595106999834< /Time><review>Very fresh. Always delicious. Had ordered delivery multiple times,  and today one of the bowls was missing the spicy tuna, it happens... called the store to let them know, because the spicy tuna is the best part of the bowl... and a member of the team personally delivered to my house the missing fish. And few extras. I really didn't expect that! Love this place.<//review></record></dataset><record>

I love Michelle and her charismatic behavior. I don't think I have ever seen her without a smile on her face. Also, I enjoy Jackie and how sweet she is. She is always cleaning something and if not, she is eager to help customer that is ready. I also love that guy with the bleached hair(sorry I cannot remember his name) who is extra informative with every item on the menu and is a definite seller of all the new options you guys have added to your menu. When we do frequent in the day, which isn't often, Brooke is a sweetheart as well. There have been a couple odd moments but nothing worth writing about. You have a great team Michelle! We are so happy to be patrons at your restaurant.<//text>

Lemon Shark Poke,located in the beautiful foothills community of Yucaipa California,
serves the freshest poke style cuisine around!
The restaurant is sparkling clean, big windows,has loads of seating inside and out and plenty of free parking!
The servers are courteous and helpful-they have a wide selection of poke choices,sauces,appetizers-I had the spam nori wrapped rice with drizzle sauce-really great!
All the signature poke bowls are great-portions are generous too!
They have "Stubborn" craft beverages on draft in all the favorite soda flavors too.
A really terrific highly recommended poke experience for lunch,dinner or snack!

They have fish that is unlabeled and they don't tell you it's a dollar extra until it's in your bowl. Most places will give you at least 2 scoops at the end such as crab, seaweed salad, masago, however it's extra if you want more than one or would like more than a very small scoop. What was extremely disappointing was how foul the spicy tuna tasted. That was definitely past it's expiration date. Also I wonder how clean a restaurant really is if they don't even have toilet seat covers.<//Review>< Pics>

<Response>{'time': 1581055841387, 'text': "Hi Victoria.  I'm sorry you did not enjoy your experience at LemonShark.  The Ahi that does not yet have a label for it is brand new to our menu- It is a traditional Hawaiian seasoned Ahi-  We just starting serving it two days ago.  I'm sorry the staff did not inform you of the upcharge before placing it in your bowl.  I will make sure we do a better job to inform the customers BEFORE the poke goes into the bowl.  Usually the staff is very good about that.  I am very sorry if you were informed of the uncharge late.  Our premium toppings do come one option for a one or two scoop poke bowl, and two choices for a three scoop poke bowl.  I'm sorry that you did not enjoy our spicy tuna, but I can assure you it was definitely not past it's expiration date.  All of our food is closely monitored and every food item in our restaurant is labeled and dated. I know the Spicy tuna was fresh, because I made it myself.  I am also sorry we do not have toilet seat covers in our bathroom, but we do clean our bathrooms every night before we close, including the toilets, sinks and floors.  We work very hard to keep our entire restaurant clean-  It is a pride to us.  Over all I am sorry you did not enjoy LemonShark, or have a good experience with us.  I hope you enjoy the rest of your evening."}< /Response><Gmap_id>0x80db5152c2df20f3:0x1569fca2ebcc1367</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Staff were very helpful and patient as this was my first visit. Lots of fresh tasty options. Bottled and fountain drinks available as well as moche ice cream treats. Restaurant seating area clean and tidy. Convenient location. Definitely worth a return visit, with high marks for taste and quality.</Review>< name>

<review>We love it! My husband and I were visiting Yucaipa to get a bed and the employee who served us was great. However, I did make the mistake of requesting too much cucumber salad (cucumber and sesame seeds in vinegar) which made my bowl way to salty to taste any of the other components! The other woman, I’m assuming a manager, checked up on us to make sure we were enjoying our food and I told her about my mistake and she immediately offered to add more rice and sauce to neutralize the sour. She also offered to put us in the rewards program and gave us a 20% off coupon for our next visit. I’m glad my husband spotted LemonShark Poke, what an awesome franchise!</review><user_id>109866742195582775369</user_id></record>

This was my first time trying poke.... and I have to say I really enjoyed it... maybe even more than sushi... and I'm a big on sushi.... my experience  was awesome...server McKenna  was very nice... and the fish was delicious... nothing but good things to say.... I will be a return customer  for sure ...If not once a week being its friendly on my wallet as well... lastly the craft sodas are delicious.... I'm not the type to normally leave reviews... but this place deserves  the five stars from me....</review>

If you like sushi, you'll love this place! I've had a few different poke bowls and lemon shark is my favorite. It's the cleanest and the yummiest! I always go spicy and throw spicy mayo and eel sauce on top</text>

Great atmosphere, encouraging and entertaining instructors. Arrived as walk-ins and we're allowed to participate in that evening's class. Good selection of drinks, and beautiful example of examples on the walls. The also offer paint-your-pet and painting for 2 classes. We had a lot of fun, plus they offer a free skills class later on if you wanted to improve that painting.< /Review>

It was AMAZING!  I thought the class would be full but it only ended up being three painters and it was great.  My friend and I were a little worried that we would not not be able to do the painting but the wonderful staff prepped the canvas with an outline which totally put us at ease.  I also want to add that Jade is a fabulous instructor and her words of encouragement got us through the process so we ended up with a pretty good painting that I can proudly hang in my home!!< /text>

Highly recommended. Casual atmosphere and so much fun! Instructor lead painting step by step :)

Traveling to CA for work, a coworker took me here for my birthday. PWAT treated me extra special for my birthday, starting with a free drink. PWAT also plays games while we paint - I won a painting and a wine bottle opener refrigerator magnet!</text>

<Review>Painting with a twist was fun. They make it as easy as possible for you to create the painting project. Staff is fun and friendly. The vibe is fun. There is no wrong or right in art and they give you the freedom to truly get creative with your painting. I will definitely return for another class!<//Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

I love that you can take snacks and my group and I had such a fabulous time that we are planning a next time. Our paintings all looked different but beautiful.

This was an activity we were able to do with our Mom. The two hours went fast. We had a great instructor in Justin. The only downside is 21 and over so no kids can participate.<//review>

While we cannot have anyone in the studio under the age of 21 due to the sale of alcohol, we have partnered with Zander's Game House, located three doors down from the studio, to offer family friendly classes.  Please check out our website to see the upcoming classes we are offering.  We hope to paint and twist with you again soon!"}<//Response>

Five stars all around! This place is amazing! My wife and I booked our spots for Valentine’s Day and it was the best date we’ve had in a very long time. All the staff are kind, fun, polite and very helpful. The set up and vibe in the studio was really nice too. They have a bar that serves beer and wine, soda pop and water and snacks too, which is a bit over priced though (a bag of cornuts was $4.00 and a Baby Ruth candy bar was also $4.00) but the service was great. You can bring your own snacks, we saw another couple bring a plate of crackers and cheese and fruit. They provide all the art supplies as well as a canvas that you’ll paint on and aprons to help you not get dirty. They play good music and have fun games in between and during the painting session, where you can win prizes. My wife and I ended up winning a really cool and neat free  painting. The instructor was awesome and fun and she has a great friendly sweet personality. She gives painting instructions on stage and she has a microphone so you’ll be able to hear her instructions just fine and they have a tv screen on the wall showing you every painting step along the way so you won’t miss nothing. The staff walks around too helping you out and giving you more paint and art supplies if you need them. Having the opportunity to meet other people was fun too. You get to sit next to others as well as the company you come with. Overall the entire art studio was amazing! The experience alone was amazing and my wife and I will definitely be coming back for another date. They have classes for every occasion and group sessions and party sessions for adults. The restrooms are easily accessible and clean. Parking is convenient and easy to find too. Come early before your session so you can get settled in and get your drinks. They have silhouette paintings that you can have fun with and put your face up to and take pictures and post on social media or to just have for your memories. They take a group picture after the class which is free and they send it to you through your email that you booked the art session with, it’s neat to have as a reminder of good times. They also walk around the art studio during the session taking pictures of everyone and everything that’s going on to have for their social media and art studio. You will definitely have lots of fun at this studio and taking home your painting is really cool too. Five stars for this art studio and everything it represents. I recommend Painting with a Twist to everyone, it is definitely something you need to experience!<//review>

We had a most incredible event to support FOOD Share! Fun!  Creative Expression, Wine and Paint everywhere!  the staff are beyond wonderful with a lot of humor and compassion for the budding artists.  The whole set up makes becoming an artist not so distant a dream..... who wouldn't want to go play in the paint shop??<//Review>

<review>This place is fantastic!!! Jessic, Heidi and Roxanne are running an amazing business where creativity and a fun night out intertwine! I have been here many many times and never have a bad time! I’ve experienced relaxed Saturday afternoon classes to Friday night girls night out classes and it’s always a good time!!!!! I’ve ditched other paint and sip places and now go here exclusively because they do such a great job at mixing up the class options, making me always feel welcome, encouraging my creativity without being critical, and most importantly helping me unwind and have an amazing time!!!! Even my hubby ends up having a great time when I twist his arm to come here for date night!!!!</review>< Date>

<Response>{'time': 1517696905082, 'text': "Thank you for your comments, Krista!  We are thrilled you had a fun time and will speak with the instructor of your class about giving more detailed steps for future classes.  You will find that our classes are less expensive than competitors because we don't charge you for a drink up front.  A great many of our customers do not drink when painting and we don't think it's fair to charge them for a beverage they don't get.  Those who do wish to drink can purchase as they go.  We take requests for music so the next time you come and you're just not digging the tunes, please let us know and we'll play something else.  We hope to see you again soon to paint one of the over 9,000 paintings in our library!"}<//Response>< user_id>

The experience was fun, but unlike Painted Cabernet, your ticket to Painted with a Twist did NOT include an alcoholic beverage. The music did not fit the crowd, but luckily improved by mid-class. The instructor was good, but not as detailed and helpful as some I've had at Painted Cabernet. Overall, it was still really fun with friends and I'd go back. By looking at the walls, there is a MUCH larger painting selection at Painted with a Twist.< /Text>

<text>Our instructor was talented and patient.  I thought the second game where you got points to "answer yes if you've ever done the following..." many of which were illegal, dangerous, or just wrong, was kind of off-putting....Needless to say, I did not win that game lol If you think you're going to peacefully paint a masterpiece while quietly sipping a glass a wine, this is not the case. The noise level (voices and music) was very high. One lady in particular was literally yelling across the room at one point. I wonder what the policy is on cutting people off the drinks? 🤔</text><GmapID>0x80e83619249db3d1:0xd01faf0a2fa011c0</GmapID>< Rating>

<text>Loved it here, helpful staff, fun environment. I personally like the more realistic painting here versus other painting places. I learned brush strokes, blending & different techniques. Thank you PWAT Camarillo

Wow this was my second time here & it was just as awesome as it was the first time.

Although Roxanne has been my most favorite artist so far.  She made the class so relaxing & fun! She was so encouraging & it didn't feel like we had to paint the exact painting, "feel free to make it your own."

I brought 2 newbies & they were already asking when we can do another one. Great job PWAT!<//text><gmapID>0x80e83619249db3d1:0xd01faf0a2fa011c0< /gmapID><user_name>Jennifer F</user_name><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPr5e3AeY7WxA8qjU-eRc4t0Qb1TpUDLzpuFwZE=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics>< userid>

Rude customer service on March 27, 2021...typical of 2.5 star hotel which should have tipped me off... when you're in the service industry it's paramount that you show and be courteous to your customers/clients... I didn't catch her name but she spoke with a disrespectful tone... upon my check-in I got finessed with a $100 deposit hussle which wasn't mentioned in my booking arrangements...I will not be returning and I definitely will discourage friends/family/strangers from future bookings of this hotel... I will say that you still have comfortable beds in your hotels.<//review>

<Review>This room was okay but it could have been way better. This room was not cleaned the way it should have been.  Receptionist was nice at check in. We went to turn the light on and there was spider webs on the lamp. I wiped down the remote things and it was filthy! If you're going to stay here id recommend sanitizing everything when you get there because they sure aren't doing it.<//Review><user>105234165734823178850<//user>< rate>

<Text>Super friendly staff.

This "extended stay" hotel does technically have a kitchenette, however they forgot a few important things like a coffee pot, dishes, and utensils. I chose to stay at extended stay hotel BECAUSE they have these things so that I don't have to go buy a second coffee pot, since I have one at home, and am not at home/can't travel back across the country to get mine.

Lots of wear and tear, and I'm pretty sure a place can't be clean, let alone sanitary with dust and roaches.</Text>< username>

Very disappointed! The hotel is more of low income housing! Kids running all around, doors slamming. Had to get ear plugs to get some sleep. The room itself floor was sticky maybe bad mop job. I could go on worst experience I’ve ever had at Motel. Also they state coffee maker and utensils for room amenities that’s a negative</Text>

<text>Clean room with the kitchen as an added plus. We stayed during a stormy night and about 2 hours into our stay we lost all tv connection. We weren't able to watch the tv until the next morning when we were checking out.

This is an awful and disgusting place to stay. The room was dirty, the sheets look like they haven’t been changed. The room smelled like someone had been smoking weed in it for years. Also, it’s is an unsafe place. Our car was broken into minutes after arriving and we had even gotten all our things out of it before it was broken into. Definitely not a good place to stay especially if you have kids.<//text>

< review>
Property was dirty and I felt unsafe for covid compliance as well as general safety. I am 64 yrs old and very concerned about covid. A cleaning staff person was getting on to the elevator with me and was not wearing a mask, so I got off. A couple exited the elevator, not wearing or carrying masks. Other people were hanging around outside my room, again not wearing or carrying masks. I never even entered my room. I turned around, went to front desk and checked out as soon as possible. I reentered my credit card in order to get the $100 mandatory deposit I was charged when I checked in. It was such a relief to leave. I stayed at very clean and safe Sheraton 4 Points, which was also closer to the Sacramento Airport. I had a very early flight and that was crucial, as I had to return my rental car.<//review>

First let me say, the front desk staff was very kind and friendly. I chose this place for the kitchen, and thought I was getting a real deal. Very disappointed. The place is showing serious wear and lack of long term maintenance. Hard water deposits on the sink fixture and mold stains in the bathroom indicate someone occupied this room for a long time without any basic cleaning. Frame on the bathroom mirror was worn away to bare wood. Floor was brand new laminate, I've got a good guess as to why. Only a small bit of toilet paper left on the roll and no spare, hair in the shower drain. No door sweep let in cold air all night with only one thin blanket and no spare. Door frame seemed a little out of place, and deadbolt seemed offset, as if the door was busted open at some point? Fire alarm went off at 2 am for about 30 seconds and I worried about my safety the rest of the night. I know this is supposed to be a long term option, but wouldn't expect this lack of care and maintenance in a Motel 6. Perhaps they cater to transitional housing for the homeless? Won't stay here again.</review>

If possible, negative 5 stars. Reception lady Angela (white lady with too much lipstick) decided to kick me out of the room because I called in and said there were cigarette burns marks in my sheets. 30 min after calling in she also sent security to check occupancy level in my room. I was alone in my room and communicated with  security. They told me that they would most likely need to kick me out since the receptionist front desk lady Angela was irritated. They said if I have friends coming to have them register with front desk. My guests did not arrive for another  hour. But in the meantime Angela called and accused me of lying to her about occupancy even though I paid for up to 4 people and that I would have others register when they arrived.  She yelled obscenities/cussed at me and hung up before I could let her know that my other occupants would come register when they arrived. When they did arrive and went to register she ignored them and refused to even acknowledge them at the front desk like a petulant child.

Don't walk but RUNAWAY from this place. If they allow a crazy child like Angela to run this place on the weekends I can only imagine HOW THEY RUN this place regularly.</Text>

Disaster, gave me 3 differential rooms all of them not clean or ac is broken bed wasn't clean or made. And I don't want to talk about the  trash on the stairs and the smell.
Place looks like a drug paradise!
And lady from the front desk was extremely unprofessional and rude!!!
Refuse to give me any other room because I was making them dirty.
When I sad that I can't make them dirty when they are already dirty she got really angry at me.
Guess truth hurts.
And she asked me to live and never come back.
Never made me happier when she returned my money and I went off of property.<//Text>

<Review>Very unkept hotel. Lot of homeless and no security to keep them out or at least from sleeping on the property went to bead early because I had to get up at 230 am to catch a flight. Around 10 pm someone was banging on my door yelling and I yelled back. They banged again and I yelled even louder. Their response was “ I didn’t think anyone was in this room”. Not much sleep after that. It’s a horrible place.<//Review>< pictures>

Not only was the room absolutely filthy, stains on everything from the bedding to the carpets and counter tops, there wasn't even a fitted sheet on the bed. To make matters worse whomever was staying above us was literally stomping and making sound loud noises it sounded like there was a construction site above us. I after next to no sleep I call the next morning to express my frustrations, was told to call back in the morning to speak to a manager about getting a comp the next day. I have been calling for WEEKS now and management STILL has no returned any of my messages. Trash hole of a place, naked tweaker loitering out front and beyond disgusting insides, that was reason enough not to come back but the service is atrocious.< /review>

Very ghetto and I called around 2:45 pm and told them I was about 20 minutes away and they said ok no problem check in is at 3pm so you should be good and when we arrived it took them almost an hour because they had a maid cleaning the room which was not even clean if you are just trying to find somewhere to sleep for a night it may be fine but I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone with kids especially these are th pic I took when we stepped in the room<//text>

Positive: Location is great-close to many shops & restaurants. Fridge, microwave, stove for cooking is a plus. Internet is available, but slow. Negative: Room was old and smelled a bit. Loud music and people hanging outside the parking lot day and night. No housekeeping. Pricy for 2 stars. Bed was small and only two pillows. Could hear my neighbors.<//Review>

Room was as advertised, but it did smell a bit like cigarettes even though it was supposed to be a non-smoking room. I called the front desk to ask for an extra blanket. The person who answered said they had none. I asked for a few extra sheets instead and she rudely relief that they had none of those either. Really?! It was quite disappointing for such a simple request to be handled in this way.</Review>

Room had someone in it when we arrived and was disgusting. We booked through Priceline last minute and I’ve never regretted something more. We arrived at midnight, exhausted from a long drive. We were told there were no rooms available however upon further review they found our reservation and gave us our key card. As we carried our sleeping toddler to the room a man was running into our assigned room, grabbed a fanny pack an then ran out. We hesitantly entered the room since we were carrying a sleeping toddler and called the front desk to ask why the heck there was a man in there. They had no answers and said they’d bring it up with the general manager in the AM. Their answer to my concern about another person having a key to our room was that we should use the bolt. Unfortunately we have nowhere else to stay tonight so we are stuck here. We bolted the door and barricaded it with the arm chair. Based on the no rooms comment we received when we got here, I suspect they were letting someone squat in this room thinking that no one was coming since we didn’t check in until late. To add to this horrible experience, the room smells like cigarette smoke despite the fact that we specifically booked non smoking. Burn marks on the sink back up my suspicions that this is indeed a smoking room. It also appeared that someone had peed on the bathroom floor - see photos. This place is so disgusting it makes me want to swear.<//Text>

<Text>I found dead cockroaches & flies on the floor in the room. The elevator needed to be swept. Blankets are thin & super light. Only two towels were provided & the wrapper to the toilet paper roll was left on the counter. The lady at the front told me that they offer breakfast but failed to inform me that it is only coffee, granola bars, & muffins. Which is a basic Continental breakfast.

The good is that there is a full size refrigerator & electric stove in in the room.

We ended up having to go to the store to buy bedsheets because their sheets was visibly dirty and had pet hair! The only 1 chair they had in the room had all kinds of stains. The carpet was visibly filthy and the cabinetry were beat up! The water pressure in the shower was sooo low that it practically just dripped! <br/>More importantly, this place isn't located in a good neighborhood. They were many homeless and low-lives hanging around the building. Some of them even hung around in the parking right outside our window which made us very uneasy! The good reviews posted for this location are either from their own staff or from people who doesn't know any better. Definitely not a safe place and would NEVER EVER recommend!!!</Review>< Gmap_id>

We checked in around 8 p.m. and went up to 319 only to find the room hadn't been cleaned. It looked like someone had just gotten outta bed and showered and left just b4 we walked in. The front desk clerk was apologetic and quickly gave us another room, but that was it. I called extended stay america's 1-800 number and reported it and they said they' get back to us in 24 hours.

This Rosin Ct. Location is Horrible ! Light fixtures are hanging off walls. The stove light doesn't work. Only the back burner works on the stove. The front light flickers and bearly comes on. Counters and cabinet edges are worn and tattered.  Trashes are over flowing. Room floors are not clean AT ALL. Door mats are dirty. Elevator is filthy. Homelss digging in trash cans. But staff is friendly.</Review>

We asked if there were any accommodations that could made for this extreme inconvenience, and the General Manager said no. That we still had to checkout at 1030 even though our stay was riddled with roach infestation and a leaking swollen ceiling. I have pictures and videos of this all and I intent to contact corporate and the BBB and housing authority. Very upset how me and my family were handled after the extreme inconvenience we experienced.</review>< pictures>

<text>Extended Stays are generally nice. They usually have great prices and very decent rooms which means high value. This particular Extended Stay is a little rough. It would be best to avoid this one unless you have time to check it out in person and it passes your test. Great ice trays though.< /text></record></dataset><record>

You can't beat the location of this hotel! Footsteps away from Union Square!!! Perfect!The hotel its self is a solid 3 star. The rooms are comfortable and clean, the most important thing. They have a great little bar in the reception area and all the staff are super friendly!! Also, the prices of the rooms are very reasonable compared to the bigger 4/5* in the area!If you are on a budget, want a decent location this is the place to stay!!!!< /Text>

<username>Joseph Tomalka< /username><text>Worst place ever. I would not give it one star but needed to write this review. First, there is trash very where, not just around the dumpsters, but piled up on the sidewalk. The trash cans in the stairwells on the weekends are always overflowing. The changed the mattresses out and just threw the sheets on the floor were I found them after working all day. When I went to get clean sheets I was give a bed spread with cigarette burns. The carpet needed to be vacuumed but was not and the person at the front desk could care less and made no effort to rectify the situation. Since work is paying the bill, I am calling my manager today and have them move me to a different facility. This is the worst extended stay I have been at, don't stay here you will want to leave like me.< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< time>

They charge a $100 deposit here. I will never stay here again. Took over a week to get my money back on my card. Had to jump through hoops to expedite refund.< /Review>

Exciting night tonight- Paid for what I thought would be a "nicer" hotel.  Whelp….
1. Homeless (?) hanging around outside,  smoking, and they all seem to know one another.
2. Desk gives me a key- I open room 214 and there's a guy laying on the bed,  old lady in the bathroom.  Just a bit unsettling.  Oops.
3. We get to an EMPTY room,  smells like marijuana,  but clean.
Guess ya can't win 'em all…<//review>

Beware of the bed bugs or fleas. I found clothes from previous guest and children's toys still in the room. I wouldn't recommend staying here. The staff was friendly that's why I gave 2 stars but this place really needs to be steam clean.</text>

We made our stay over a week in advance, we had a part to go to at 4:00 pm and were driving in and it would take 3 hours
The day of the stay we called to get an early check on and received a conformation. Cool we thought? But when we arrived after 3 1/2 hours on the road due to traffic my wife needed to you the restroom and was told they had no public bathroom in the lobby, so I showed them our conf.  number and e mail with early check in and was told by the same counter person no early check in and our room would not be ready till 6:00 pm . That wasnt going to work we had enough and call Marriott down the street got right in wint in 5 minutes  and my wife used the lobby bathroom with NO DRAMA. ITS a much cleaner hotel,friendly staff and free breakfast in the morning . Beware of extended stay hotel stay away!!!!!!!!!< /text>

<Review>So I had got a room for a week. I was informed by the lady upfront no smoking in the room. Not a problem for me since I have kids. So I step outside my door to smoke. The manager crystal had came by knocked on the door like she was the police an asked if we were smoking in the room, clearly I was eating and had my son on the bed feeding him as well. She stated that it was a no smoking room I told her I know that I step outside the door. So then about 4 hours goes by and here she is again telling my husband he can't smoke outside the door, which is fine so he said you can tell her which is me. She then asked if he asking about my husband if he will be here an how long are we going to be here. I told her till Friday. She then proceeded to tell me that she doesn't do good with attitude all due to him telling her that she can tell me. She felt that it was rude because he could of told me. Anyways she said that we can not smoke in front of the door. I said fine but did you need to come to my door twice when the first time I told you that was where I smoke. Now I feel like she is just being rude because both times she said something to my husband an got mad when he said she could let me know. First off if your going to say something to me when thats what I told you I was doing why didn't you tell me no you need to be in the parking lot the first time instead of being rude to say something again. Her response was she can't be out here 24/7. I'm sorry that's your job you didn't have to come back twice if you would of said that the first time. I want to leave but will have to wait for the check since I paid cash they wont give me my cash back and I have no other money than what I paid for the hotel. Smells weird when I came in like old food. Will never be here again would of rather wen to Roseville location.</Review><user_name>Mary-Rachael Vandervort< /user_name></record>

<text>The room was okay, I was lucky not to have roaches but I'd recommend bringing your own sheets. The bathroom was clean. Giving this place a low rating because of the area it's in. Plenty of suspicious people lurking around the property and was not somewhere I felt comfortable leaving anything valuable in the car. Other guests weren't usually the best of people either. I'd try to avoid this place, but if you can't find anywhere else along your spontaneous trip, then it's manageable. Not worth the price though.</text><Rate>2<//Rate>< user>

YUCK! COCKROACHES!!! And a lot of them. :(

The room was outright foul. :( The stained mattress was the first thing to greet me upon entering the abysmal domicile. Abstract spatters covered the ragged bedsheets and limp pillows. The dresser drawers were janky and crawling with bugs. :(

Just...ew! SO GROSS!

The surrounding area is also crawling with homeless junkies and thieves. It is not a safe area by *any* stretch of the imagination.

Definitely do not stay here!</Text>

Before entering, it took like 20 mins for someone to even be at the front desk so we were waiting outside with thousands of bugs all over the ground outside. Once we checked in we immediately got a refund and left. The room smelt so bad of cigarettes (which is not okay for my husbands health condition) and there was a bug in the sheets. The room was dirty and out dated. I couldn't bare to be in that room for longer than 10 mins it was so filthy. I've stayed at extended stay before but this location was awful. Poor area, bad management, save your money.</text>

Since I booked on Priceline, I'm told no refund. Place is dirty! Pretty bad when you have to bring your own disinfectants and clean before your stay! Some guy at the desk said his room had bed bugs! However I torn our bed apart and didn't find any. There was hieever, a dead cockroach on the floor! Come on people! I'm locked in for 4 nights!< /Text>

There was candle wax on the floor and chair in one room. Then in another room we stayed in there was a cockroach. Then in another room we stayed in it smelled like bug spray. But.. they do offer coffee with creamer and oatmeal and muffins for breakfast, that was nice.< /review>

Can't even give a star rating. 1st room we checked into the ac unit didn't work. So we changed rooms. 2nd room,  when I opened the door, the bed had not been changed from  the previous guest nor had the room been cleaned. One of the chairs was broken. There was trash under the sink,  used soap in bathroom sink and tub, dirty tub the floor by refrigerator was sticky.  The ac worked in this room but was really loud, by the way both my partner and I are death, so it had to have been extremely loud for us to hear it, and the only way to turn it off was to unplug it from the wall. So we reported to the front desk and was informed that housekeepers were gone for the night and that there were no more rooms available. We went down to the  office to get a refund for the room, the front desk personal said it would be 4 to 7 days before it would be back in the account and then mentioned that he would go up and clean the room himself while we were gone down left for an hour or so came back only to find that the bed had been fixed, but not sure if the bedding was changed or not,  the trash had not been taken out nor the bathroom cleaned and sticky floor not been taken care of and now the latch lock in the door was barely hanging on by one stripped out screw. We could tell that someone had been in the room but couldn't say for sure what had been done.  There was no way in hell I would allow either one of us to stay there.  It was a horrible experience and wouldn't even wish upon my worst enemy.</review>

My employer needed my assistance and put me up at this motel for 10,weeks.  My room was always cleaned on schedule, and the employees were great.  When i had a bad allergy attack they gave me extra tea bags and honey to help with my cough which I was very grateful and happy to receive.<//review>

<Text>This place was gross. First off I landed at about 745pm and didn't arrive to this hotel until about 8 or 830. They tell me they no longer have any king size beds only queens. I went ahead and took the queen because I was tired. The next morning, I went to the desk and I told them I had a separate reservation for the weekend, if I stayed would I get a king. They went out of their way to get me what I needed. So I moved rooms in the afternoon. It was disgusting. First they need to update their rooms. They had this one chair at the table mesh with cloth, when you turned it around it looked like some tricks were turned on that chair, if you know what I mean without being too graphic. The bedspread was old, it was clean, but it still look like it had dirt. When you pulled the bedspread and sheets off underneath the second sheet was stained with blood.  The neighbors had this cat litter box propping the door open and the elevators were trashed. So the staff was nice, that's why I give it a one star. The hotel needs to have a complete overhaul. There were other things wrong with the rooms but I am actually tired of writing.< /Text>< pictures>

Doesn’t look like anyone here works and they stay up all night blasting music and getting into fights.

This probably explains why the staff is quick to move actual clients somewhere else when asked.< /text></record></dataset><record>

I stayed on the second floor and have had numerous issues with trashy people partying all ours of the night with a front office that is too lazy to do anything about it, people smoking near my room causing me and my wife to breathe in second hand smoke all hours of the day and night. People from the third floor have spit on me while I was attempting to lean on the rail while on a business call, there are women and kids outside yelling partying and fighting until 3am on a regular basis and twice during my stay the front desk knocked on my door at 2 and 3 am while i was sleeping to tell me that there were noise complaints about me while there was an obvious party going on next door however when i called about the party the front desk said " they said they weren't making noise..... what is the point of a front desk and security that do nothing about legitimate problems? We have complained to the front office both employee AND management and they assure that the issue has been handled and minutes later the smoking and partying continues. The front desk has one particular person named Johnathan , a kid that has long black hair and looks like he is 15 that not only does nothing but he ignores the state laws as well i have personally caught him on both my floor two rooms down smoking two cigarettes in the walkway and i was forced to inhale the second hand smoke upon walking past which is not only disrespectful it is a blatant disregard of California law while on shift, in my day that is automatic grounds for termination. This Child is the reason my wife and i left and moved to a different extended stay in west Sacramento. I will never stay in the North gate extended stay ever again because of their blatant disregard for their paying customers who might i add are paying the kids wages for him to ignore us ignore the law and blow smoke in my wife's face which took everything i had not to report him, the manager and the hotel itself to the police department, heath department, and the local news for the absolute worst customer service i have ever experienced in my entire life and I'm in my 50s. at the very minimum Johnathan should be fired for violating the law on shift and blowing smoke in my wife's face, but at this point i know the management will do nothing that means they have to lift a finger or do anything out of their comfort zone. At this point i Hold the manager responsible for allowing her employee to break the law, harass me and my wife, blow smoke in our faces and spend the entire night walking around taking smoke breaks all over the building disrespecting everyone that PAID for a non smoking room which at this hotel there is no such thing because the staff AND trashy customers have no respect for the law nor the people that have the right to breathe  clean air in THEIR OWN ROOM!!! DO NOT STAY HERE YOU WILL BE DISRESPECTED IGNORED AND TREATED LIKE THE LOW LEVEL EMPLOYEES ARE TOP PRIORITY OVER THEIR CUSTOMERS WHO PAY THEIR SALARY. I have never had a worse experience and neither will you.</text><user>117937714040104230880<//user></record>

Horrible experience!!! Never will I ever make the mistake of being anywhere near this establishment again. Rented one of their rooms and woke up in the middle of the night to see cockroaches crawling in the kitchen!!! And the manager does not deserve to be in his position. He denied everything while yelling at me and even cursing at me. Hes lucky I had wasn't my usual self that day. Stay away!!!!< /text>

I like the rooms, there is a small kitchen so it's like a studio. And since alot of the people that stay here end up staying for quite some time, they don't offer room service daily. If you want your room cleaned, you have to stay there over a week in order for a maid to come and clean your room, if you are staying less than 7 days, then you don't get anyone to come clean your room you have to do it yourself. You have to bring your old towels and sheets to the front desk and they will give you clean ones and you have to put the sheets on the bed yourself and clean by yourself. That doesn't make any sense because you would think it should be the other way around but whatever.< /Text>

Filthy,floors un-mopped or even vacuumed/swept, kitchen just as if not worse. Burners didn't work, was charged $50 for my service/companion animals and when I let them know they were service animals, the girl requested my "proof/paperwork" and said thatbuf I didn't have it I was being charged anyway but I know that law states its illegal to ask for paperwork.management had yet to respond to my many complaints! Its been 6 days since my stay. Used to be nice, not anymore.....< /Text>

<Review>This motel is unsatisfactory in pretty much every category. I’ve been to a lot of hotels in many cities and this one has the poorest quality I’ve ever stayed at. When we got here, the lobby was tiny and people were crammed. The staff didn’t seem to have a understanding of how to quickly check guests in or the flow of the check in line, as two people behind us got checked in before us. After thirty five minutes of waiting we finally got checked in. When we got to our room. The bed was not made, their was staining and pieces of trash all over the floor and there was leftover food from the guests before us all around the room. Their was a few spider webs in the bathroom. So the room had obviously not been properly tended to in a long time. This motel obviously has a failed management strategy. When you arrive you’ll just have that sense, it’s not a place people go who have 1 detail in their life figured out. I didn’t list all the disappointing parts because there were simply too many but I would never come back here. If you decide to come expect a very very subpar experience.<//Review>< Date>

We assume that they cancelled our reservation so they could jack up the price for someone else to reserve. Who does that to someone? Very disrespectful!!!!

Absolutely the worst.  I didn't even get to check in before being turned off by the service. Lobby was void of personnel for over 30mins. Followed instructions for use of house phone for "immediate" service. Phone rang, with no help to answer. Watched as 4 different other guests came to the lobby and use the service phone to only be let down. Went to the Marriot for a higher cost, but worth the service and amenities.<//review>

This would of been the forth time staying their. Go to the hotel close 12am after being on the go from 10am in Vancouver BC.
She was not a happy camper, a little rude, did want help the 800 number for some reason this only booked me in for Thursday night when I told a few times until Saturday night check on Sunday at 5am.
The front desk did want Exstended my room either until Saturday. Every I stay there I got extra coffee a pot for cooking a fork knife and a can opener completely with no problems, but this it seems that she was not intended in having me there.
Very unpleasant stay, and the room was not completed at all. No totle tissue, one towel one soup. Nothing to cook with no coffee either. A complete waste of time.
My stay was one night only and the last time I will there, and am in Sacramento once a year for medical and spending money on hotel.
This is a complete waste of money.

Never again I will stay there</text>

This was the worst place I have ever stayed. Your commercials clearly do not represent this facility. Not sure how a no smoking room has stained cigarette burns all over the sink. Carpet filthy, smells like animals and all the fire alarms pulls on the floors were pulled off the wall with capped wires. Pretty sure that's against code. My suggestion...do not stop!!!<//Review>

I was rather fortunate in that my room was reasonably clean. However during the check-in process two other residents came in to complain that their room was a mess.
Stage for 3 Days the first day the AC worked sporadically the last two days the AC did not work at all. The last day I was in Sacramento the temperature was 94.<//text>

Horrible horrible horrible... No pillows in my room when I checked in... Trash piled up every where and the smell was over whelming.  You could see the cockroaches scurry across the stair steps and there were so many hookers and pimps and dealers just  walking around the property looking for customers that I wouldn't go outside without my boyfriend by my side. I would never come back to this good foresaken hotel even if it was the last place left...< /text>

This place is nasty and raggedy. First room the toilet didn't work, bedding was dingy. The second room was not the king size bed that I had reserved the fridge was dirty and burnt on the inside curtains had food on them had to turn the TV at an angle just to get it to work. When I complained about my &95.00 room I was told I given a coupon to use at any one of there places as long as they had rooms available. That was a lie. I even sent them pics of the place. I will say the front deck ppl where really nice.<//Text>

I don't recommend this place at all. Person at the front desk was very rude, he was on the phone and did not even even say hi or nothing, had me waiting for a lil while until another employee came in and took care of me. Very dirty everywhere, room floor was still wet and very sticky, there was still trash from previous guest, a hole on the wall and the sheets did not look clean at all.<//text>

This place needs serious help. I'm giving it 3 stars only because I stayed there when I was waiting for my own place to be ready. Outside sidewalks and stairs need some hot water and soap to clean. Cigarette butts need to be picked up off the ground. It looks like an astray..... Breakfast is a joke....< /Text>

My experience there was horrible. 3 weeks of torchure and the staff was not willing to do anything about the bed bugs. We showed them the bites, captured a bug and bagged it for them to see. My daughter was seen at the ER for bite infection, bit on her eye which caused swelling, and Because they personally found none at the foot of the beds during there 1 minute search, they stated that we brought them in. Before arriving there and Since leaving, we have not gotten 1 bite. There was dog urine on the stairs, trash at the bottom of the stairs which brought a lot of flies. I will never stay at this location again.</text>

<review>Tons of roaches everywhere. Woke up at 4am this morning because I managed to kill two roaches crawling on my body. There were tons of spots on the outer top sheet that had roach guts on them( did not sleep on this blanket). Room was supposed to be non-smoking, but one step in, you could smell the thick, musty smoke smell. Room was not clean. Thick layers of dirt everywhere. Will NEVER stay here again, will NEVER recommend. 0 stars.</review><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

If there was a zero star I would give it. Everything besides the manager was gross. He was helpful and friendly, found a room when they were ‘sold out’ even tho central reservations let me make a reservation. Trashed rooms, garbage overflowing etc. 1st room smelled of smoke and eggs and didn’t look clean. Second room, manager cleaned personally. Had exposed wiring and holes in the walls. 2nd hand smoke resignated through the walls. Saw ladies of the night, drug dealers and people high. Avoid at all costs. Give night
manager promotion to another hotel. Great guy.</Text>

<Text>The room was fairly poor, with sheet rock patches and a good air conditioner (only goes down to 68). Only two pillows on the bed, and they were of poor quality. The comforter felt very plastic and fake. The bed is very worn in and on the lower end of the industry standard. Furniture is rough with a lot scuffs, chips and scratches. Paid $8 to do two loads of laundry, there was a mouse in my room (I am sure one of the 'great' tenants, or possibly the maid staff before me left the door open for too long), and the breakfast was pitiful (incredibly minimal). Wi-fi was good though. This place is a hotbed for cheap rooms, and all the great things that come with it, like homeless wanders partially without clothes and such. I recommend a third-level room to avoid the wanders and rodents. :/ I must say that the staff was quite friendly though, best part about the stay by far. I would not stay here again unless the price was dropped to nearly free.</Text>< pics>

I call to confirm my reservation and arrival time and when I show up to check in about an hours drive later I was greeted with a locked office a note on the door giving the most vague information and sent on a scavenger hunt to find a phone in the opposite direction of an arrow along with a disconnected number to reach them on finally I was able to get ahold of some lady after 30 mins of standing In The cold using there phone the lady was rude short disrespectful and told me I was not going t ok get a room until later that afternoon mind u its 2am miles from home after they already charged my damn debit card. Completely ridiculous I will never use them again especially after seeing cockroaches scurrying along there side walks</review>< Pictures>

Spiders in the bathroom, no blanket on bed, bathroom not cleaned completely, have to ask for pots and pans at lobby for kitchenette, and the breakfast was abysmal. No microwave to heat up any prepared food either. It's like they don't want people to have "extended" stays arlt this place<//Review>

Worst experience ever & a total waste of money.. This is a smoking room & there are no ashtrays.. There is only one tiny waste basket in the entire room.. If you are planning on cooking, I suggest you bring your own trash bags.. The room smells like urine.. I don't think the bed sheets are very clean either, it made my skin itch.. There are cigarette burn marks all over the restroom.. There is also a hole in the door that looks to be a gunshot.. The sink next to the electric burners is clogged & the toilet seat is very loose..

To make everything worst, the couple next door is either high on drugs or drunk.. They have been fighting & yelling for the last 2 hours & is still fighting right now as I speak..

As a traveling business man, I sleep at hotels all the time.. This is the worst place to stay.. I am never coming back to this hotel.. If it were possible, I would give this place No Stars..< /text>

<review>I'd give this place a 0 if I could.  They kicked a black family out for complaining (appropriately) about roaches and rodents.  There were 2 other black ladies standing in the lobby and the reception clerk kicked them out...for just standing there.  I think she assumed they were all together because of their skin color.  Total water bottle betty situation.   I  left immediately...will not stay at placethat treats people like this.  The roaches weren't great either...< /review>< Pictures>

This place was disgusting. My smoke free room reaked of smoke. Floor, walls and sheets had stains. Black growth around the top of the shower. Every trash can around the premises was overflowing. The staff was very courteous though.<//Text>

Im only giving them 2 stars because all the office staff were nice and professional. Regarding the room and cleanliness, I wouldn't give this location any stars. The room was dirty. Fan in the bathroom did not work. I had a mouse in my room. Thank God no cockroaches. Room is extremely small! Exterior of the property needs to be cleaned up. More then with just a leafblower.<//text>

This place is very bad with reservations. We booked directly with the hotel and got an email with a confirmation number. When we showed up they said they did not have our confirmation and no more rooms available.
The lady at the front desk and was extremely unhelpful. Never staying here again.</review>

<text>I could not bring myself to stay here even though I had a reservation. Thankfully the receptionist was able refund me without any hassle. The room was dimly lit, smelled terrible and the stairs going up to it were lined with old trash bags with garbage spilling out. Felt more like a shelter than a hotel. The girls in the lobby were nice enough, thus the two stars.<//text></record></dataset><record>

<text>I was staying at Northgate extened stay  america. I wasn't too happy with place but we had gotten a good deal for how long we had planned on being there but the new manager is very rude and can be very hostile. We had told the front desk we had a dog and a cat. I was having my oldest son come by during the day since I worked nights to come walk my dog a few times a  day. Well I didn't know that we weren't allowed to have guest over with their own pets. I figure he could walk his 2 small dogs with my 1 larger puppy. She went all postal and threw me and my younger boys out. We just lost our home and we are homeless. One of my boys is autistic. Been trying to get to understand what had happened and I don't even know what happened.  Crystal needs help. She even scream at me about my son.<//text>< gmapID>

<Name>J Darcy< /Name><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Review>Worst place I have ever stayed. I'm embarrassed for myself for even booking this place. Used a third party app for a cheap and quick trip. Chipped paint, two inch gap under the door (hear every footstep outside),  lacks even the basic hotel qualities such as washclothes, hair dryer, drinking glass, there was dirt in the shower( I showered with my shoes on),  grease cover on the walls, no top sheet on a bed made by just putting a new fitted sheet on top of the old one. Yes I checked.  This is not a place for a short term traveler. Only upside is that I have a getto story to tell my friends. If I walk out of here without bed bugs it will be a miracle. Paid for two nights ahead of time, but only staying one. Blame myself for not understanding the nasty underbelly of this industry. There are families living here long term.... This is their home; as gross and crappy as it is. This place IS NOT A PLACE FOR  SHORT TIME TRAVEL...IT IS TEMPORARY HOUSING FOR THE DISPLACED.< /Review>< user>

<Review>Came to the hotel around 10pm the night clerk really didnt have the time to help. Louis the night clerk had auditing to do and it was a sunday night Christmas. The internet callcenter mad a mistake on the reservation and tried to fix it. The hotel said no they want another 15 dollars because the manager wouldnt override the transaction. Poor quality customer service. Went to room I did not want and the bed was not made the dirty sheets where still on the chair and the trash was not taken out. Room was still dirty. The room we finally got was not better the room door wouldnt fully close the heater was broken and the door knob on the bathroom door broke and was stuck in the bathroom for a good 10 15 mintues. It just was a very bad christmas coming from this hotel. Not only that the night clerk left early and a husband and wife came right before they closed to find out there already closed.< /Review><user>None<//user></record>

<text>We made reservations for one Extended Stay and even called it to verify that we will be arriving late. They confirmed that our room was ready for us, but an hour later they called us back and moved us to a different one that was further. We got there and one of our rooms smelled like weed and the other smelled like mold. We asked if we would have bath tubs and the front desk said yes, both rooms have tubs. Well the tub I had was dirty (you could watch the dirt run down after you turned the water on) and the other room had a handicap stall for a shower! Better yet, when you turned on the handicap shower, the water would actually flood the whole bathroom floor, it didn't even run to the drain correctly. The ceiling above my shower was chipped and falling apart, there was a large crack in our toilet, and one of the light bulbs in our room was burnt out. You're better off staying at a Motel 6.< /text><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None</response><gmap_id>0x809ad7a4de460a71:0xfbbb65a762bfee56< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>
<Review>It was absolutely awful, first of all, I booked the room over the phone ahead of time and when I got there they were closed for over a half an hour to do auditing and I had to wait in the car even though I had reservations and then when I got to the room it was infested with cockroaches and it was very filthy and they were enough cockroaches for me to kill many times and floor was filthy, so I asked change rooms and that room had less cockroaches in it but I didn't realize that there's a note on that all the doors saying that the fire department was going to do some checks with the new a smoke alarms between 7:30 in the morning and 5 in the afternoon and sure enough at 7:30 in the morning the loudest alarm you ever heard going off for like 5 minutes and the whole alarm thing didn't stop till after 12 noon because they fire department had to go inside everybody's room and check each one and so it would be going off like every two minutes literally do you got any sleep, or a warning for that matter.<//Review>< Resp>

I am on day four of living in a construction zone. With no warning and absolutely no attempt at making this palatable for guests, the hotel decided to repave the entire parking lot area. This involved moving my car in the middle of the night every night for a week, which is an inconvenience but not a deal-breaker. The deal-breaker is every morning at a quarter to 8am I awake to a cloud of rancid smoke that permeates the room and gives me a migraine, and enough racket to wake the dead. When I asked for a room that might be a little farther away I was treated as if this was an insane request. As an extended stay corporate guest I have two needs of this room: space to sleep and work. Under these conditions I cannot do either and management is oddly impervious as to how this might be an opportunity for them to actually resolve a hospitality issue.<//review>

<review>Paid $100 and what I was greeted with was hairs on the pillows and stains on the sheets as you can see by the photos. I stayed for about 4 hours and that's all I could bear. When asked upon checkout how it was I told them the situation and they found it surprising and offered nothing. This was by far the most run-down cand creepy hotel I have ever stayed at. Do not stay here.<//review>< pictures>

Shouldn't even get one star filthy filthy...they had to relocate us to another room. Both were unsatisfactory. Roaches in the first room...second carpets nasty...stairway reeked of urine...we were broken into in the second room. Made a police report..the follow up has been slow going... Im done with Extended stay FOREVER! .THIS LOCATION IS ON ROSIN AND NORTHGATE.</Review>

The rooms were atrocious! The first room had cigarette burns and hair all over. The second wreaked of urine and it was very obvious that the bedding jad not been changed. I left without staying a night. Not even 10 minutes after i had left they had already rented the room to another guest! I was told they could transfer me to another location, but after checking out i was told it was not possible and left standing there with my 2 year old child by myself with out a refund and no room. Needless to say i will never recommend this place.< /Review>

<Review>I am not a big fan of the extended stay for they charge $2 to use the phone for local calls and $10 extra to have your room cleaned I have to walk up to the office to get new towels everyday and if I want a muffin in the morning I had better wake up early and make it to the office before 7 or they will most of the time not have anything left from their continental breakfast Wich is weak in the first place consisting of muffins oat meal and nature valley granola bars< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None</response><Gmap_id>0x809ad7a4de460a71:0xfbbb65a762bfee56<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<review>I reserved a room at this hotel for two nights on Priceline. When I got to the hotel after driving 2.5 hours, I was told that the hotel was overbooked and that I would have to contact Priceline because, and I quote the employee at the front desk, "It's on them (Priceline), not us". I would have probably believed her if this hadn't happened to me before when I used Priceline to book my hotel room at Extended Stay. Granted I'm not 100% sure whose fault it was overbooking the hotel however, I have used Priceline many times before at different hotels and never once had this problem. Being that this is the second time I have encountered this issue using Priceline to book a room with Extended Stay I can only come to the conclusion that the problem with overbooking lies with Extended Stay. Besides being extremely inconvenienced, the front desk employee could have been a little bit more empathetic and helpful but she was neither and I do not think I will be staying at Extended Stay stay anytime in the future.</review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

<rating>None</rating><Review>While I was happy with the location and the staff was friendly, the hotel itself was pretty scary.  We checked in, went to our room and my 10 year old daughter went in to the bathroom--as I was noticing there was only one pillow, she called out to me, um mom, there is blood on the floor.  Sure enough there was quite a bit of blood on the floor, the bathtub was covered in something pink (unsure if mildew or residual blood--hoping for the mildew as the whole tub was pink) and there were no towels. I really wish I had thought to take pictures, but was more concerned with getting out of the room.  I called down to the office and was told he would find me a new room, which he did, but it was only marginally better--at least there was no blood.  Pillows were completely flat, room was very dingy, parts of carpet were wet, and my daughter had a hard time falling asleep.  Will never stay here again or recommend it to anyone.  I felt extremely bad that I had booked my daughters coach in the same hotel.</Review>< pictures>

<Text>This place is absolutely disgusting. The front desk ladies were absolutely lovely and so so helpful because they thought that they were sold out (every though I made my reservation directly through their website) so they had a room that was off rotation for repairs put back into circulation and gave me a room and just had that room fixed for a later guest. I super appreciate that since almost all of Sacramento is sold out right now! I don't appreciate boogers on the wall, hair all over everything and the comforter looks so dingy I'm scared to even sit down let alone sleep, I think I will be heading to Walmart for some new blankies 😬<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

Booked a night thru priceline and was paid in full upon arrival. Well, to my surprise, they were already booked! Even though I'd already paid for it, i couldnt get a room there and it was already 11:20p! Talk about disappointment and frustration! I called priceline too and they couldnt find a room for me anywhere from there to sac metro, even davis! Ill be expecting my money back for that but my point is that regardless of who sold it, the property should be in better communication with their booking partners so that the inconvenience of sleeping outside in my car whn, that night, the temp dipped below freezing! I was, and still, am not impressed by this service. On the bright side, it wouldve been a convenient location. Right off of I-80 and close to the I-5.<//Text>

We checked in about 3:30 p.m traveling from Georgia for a wedding, once we got into the room I noticed the shower curtain was mildewed. Shortly afterwards my grandson opened some chips and a roach crawled from under the bed. We told the manager in which he stated that it must have crawled in front outside. We did further research and discovered more under the refrigerator. They switched rooms this was a little vebettbut the carpet was dirty, the door wouldn't close and when we got a coffee pot that was dirty. This was a vad experience in the hotel.< /text>

Low budget hotel. No washcloths in the room with I arrived. The cable TV was disappointing: the TVs themselves were upgraded to HD, but nothing else was, so there was only an extremely poor picture. None of the channels were labeled or listed anywhere.</Review>

<review>Wish I could give 0 stars.. worst extended stay I've ever stayed at! I'm checking in at the front lobby and the staff was yelling curse words and slamming things due to not wanting to work or clean rooms. Very unprofessional! The room had broken cabinets and the bed, covers and pillows didn't look clean enough to sleep on! I will NEVER go back to this location!<//review>< Pics>

<Text>Price was good but most of the lighting in the room didn't work, the electronics all malfunctioned (ie. Sound coming from the tv after turning it off, alarm going off at 12 am despite no alarm being set.) The room was cold because the device to adjust the actual unit was broken. The bathroom was gross and didn't provide a hairdryer like most hotels. Was planning on staying a week but after 1 awful night, will be going elsewhere.< /Text>< rate>

I was dropping someone off her while driving for Lyft and was waiting for the passenger while a random person was on their phone about fifteen or twenty feet away. He was describing to a dispatcher how his car was broken into and how the guy that did it was someone who lives at the hotel that he deals with on a regular basis for stuff like that. Guy I picked up was nice enough, but the place seemed like it had a lot of people trying to get back on their feet or limited options for housing. Wasn't 100% comfortable going there. The one in South Natomas is a bit worse and in a really weird, put of the way kind of location.</Text>

Horrible.  Cockroachs,  room wasn't clean,  outdated, limit channels, manger unprofessional very disrespectful,  charges cards with consent adds charges and double charges. Talks about employees and guests.  Sends employees to do her dirty work and guests. Wouldn't go back even if it was last place on earth would rather stay in a box.< /Review>

Which meant we couldn't use Wi-Fi. I asked about breakfast, what time it was. The guy who was working the night time, who was very friendly & apologetic said they didn't leave him the key for it in the morning but he went to the back & brought us back some muffins.The employees were very friendly. The girl in the morning said since we checked in on Sunday, our price was less. The bed was ok, not too comfortable though.

I booked a room here for two nights and right after i checked the reviews and they where all bad I did not see a single one. So I thought I’d call to ask about the hotel just Incause it might not be all that bad as the reviews saying they are to avoid canceling and paying a fee. When I called the person who answered the phone was soooooooo rude she answered the phone saying “what is that you want” then when I asked her about the reviews and asked her was it decent and clean she told me she didn’t have to answer my question and that “you don’t have to come here” so I canceled my reservation and went to a different extended stay lol< /Text>

<text>Worst motel I have ever been to in my life. We walked in to the hotel lobby and there was a prostitute trying to get a room with cash and arguing with the hotel lobby person. We then had to wait to get into our room and it was 530pm and check in was at 4.....we then got into the room and my friend noticed a small cockroach. We killed it. We then started to look around and they were EVERYWHERE in the room. There were dead ones on the floor and live ones on the walls. It was the most disgusting room I have ever seen in my life and for $99 I would have rather sleep in my car. DO NOT STAY HERE. I would have to rate this 0 stars. I then went to the Marriot and it was beautiful as usual. We were only staying in town for one night thankfully. But once again do not stay at the extended stay unless you want to be sleeping with bugs crawling all over you.</text>< pics>

<review>Room was a good size but it reeked of marijuana smell when it's suppose to be a NOM SMOKING ROOM. Both my kids asthma   so it is an health hazard that the room smelled the way it did. When I booked the room, it was said to be a Platinum Hotel.. NO!</review>< Pics>

Rooms are average. Net works pretty good. Prices are reasonable. House keeping if you are staying for a while is crappy they are supposed to come in once a week, its more like every other week.<//Review>

Absolutely the worst experience of my life.  In 30 years of business travel, this one was the worst.  The carpet looked like the result of a crime scene.  The refrigerator froze my food solid so I had to throw it away.  Travelocity came to my aid and helped me cancel the rest of my stay and get to another hotel.  Whew!< /Text>

The Wifi is terrible here, even the paid wifi that says it is supposed to be faster. I paid the 4.85 for the faster wifi and I can't even stream videos, or music, nothing without it disconnecting or going terribly slow.  I've called front desk, and gone through the trouble shooting steps with the phone techs and the issue was never resolved.  The wifi here is almost like being on dial up.  I've stayed at other extended stays and never had an issue with the internet free or unpaid.   Staff is awesome though, I like them.<//text>

<Review>I wish I had read the reviews before I booked this room. It’s disgusting don’t stay here! I found roaches in the room and one was on me when I woke up. the carpet is disgusting and stained all over the refrigerator was dirty. There was no tissue in the room they were no face towels. Worst room I’ve ever stayed in. I booked a king size bed but when I got here they said there were only queens available and that they often overBook. I picked up phone to call the front desk to complain about how bad the room was and look how disgusting the phone was.< /Review><name>Terry P</name><user_id>103828660587840330215<//user_id><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><Time>1510763508059<//Time>< rate>

Quite possibly the worst hotel I've ever stayed in. I chose the hotel for the kitchenette but when I checked in and asked for dishes I was told that they were out of dishes. So then what did a pay for? A kitchen with no dishes? When I got to my room it was quite unpleasant inside. Housekeeping was just leaving when I arrived, yet it looked like this room hadn't been properly cleaned in months. There are stains all over the floor. Big, dark, highly-visible stains from who-knows-what. All the furniture felt sticky and grimey. There was a layer of soap scum in the tub that looked like it hadnt been cleaned in years and I found human hairs in the bed and the tub. Also, the door didnt fit in the frame properly, so there was a crack near the bottom that let in cool air and noise and light. The outside of the hotel was just as nasty as the inside. When you exit your room you are hit with a smell of refuse, garbage, cigarette smoke and reefer. So that was nice. The garbage cans on the stair wells were constantly overflowing and leaking garbage and waste for my entire stay. At the end if the first night I went back to the front desk to see if they had more dishes ready and I was told the only thing they had available was a single skillet. Just a skillet. Thats it. No other utinsels or dishes. So I wasn't able to eat a real dinnrr that night necause I used my whole budget on groceries that needed to be cooked. Using the kitchenette that I paid for you know? But all I had was a skillet. So that night I sent an email to the customer service office and told them the issue. The next day the girl at the front desk (I think her name was Whitney) gatherred some dishes for me. She seemed to be the only person here who actually cared to do her job, so thank you Whitney. Soon after the manager called me to address the email I had sent. They said they would credit me $20 for my trouble (never saw that money...) And that they would send housekeeping to do a deep cleaning on my room on Tuesday at 10:00 AM so I should put all my personal belongings in a corner so they wouldn't be in the way. I did as instructed and waited. By 11:30 I finally left to run my errends for the day. Housekeeping never came to my room for my entire 8 day stay. I had to ask Whitney for extra towels (again, thank you Whitney). After this exoerience, I will never stay with Extended Stay America again. This hotel was not worth the money I paid.<//Text>

The customer severe at this location is super! We were traveling from Texss to Seattle with my elderly mother. We had made a reservation at Quality Inn nearby but that turned out to a very nasty stinky place. So we went over to this Extended Stay with no reservation. Tavi was so very helpful in finding a way to accommodate my husband and I as well my elderly mother. This was not easy since there was no double bed rooms available and no roll away beds. We had a very very restful stay. Then at check out the next mornin Jennifer was very very cheerful and interested in helping in any way she could.< /Review>

She just works here and none of the following is her fault:  UNCLEAN! Dirty carpet, Gross  kitchen area, tiny rooms, smelly/smoky rooms (we tried 2),  limited breakfast (but at least you can grab and go), toilet lid is "chewed" up (?),  limited wifi, unlevel floor (2nd floor), unkempt grounds, unsightly building, and even the elevator seems unsafe. I expect to see roaches, but I haven't yet. Not worth the discounted 3rd party vendor price at all!  Not worth $10 a night!  I hope these nice employees can find jobs for a better corporation! There are better hotel chains down the road for $5 more a night.</review>< pictures>

If no stars was an option, I'd select it. My wife and I were here for less than 15 minutes. There was a smell about the entire property that you couldn't explain. It was dirty. Our door was wide open when we got to the room and it reeked. The sheets were stained. Go somewhere else.< /text>

Parking lot dirty and unkempt when we pulled in. Trash, cigarette butts, and vehicles with broken, taped up windows. Signs posted everywhere to lock vehicles and owners not responsible for any theft or damage. Several patrons in the parking lot looked like they lived in their cars most of the time and others seemed to be they worked out of their cars. There were even signs posted by the local authorities with warnings. The office girls were nice, but looked at us as if we were out of place. We clearly didn't fit the look of their regular clientele. If you are into illegal activities and have no sense of smell or cleanliness, this it the place for you. It got even worse once we got to our rooms. We had two rooms and both smelled of dog urine, possibly human urine, weed, cigarettes, and musty/mold. Dirty, smelly, stained carpets. Stains on the linen. Several female neighbors seemed to be soliciting their services while their male counterparts guarded the doorways. We feared we would not be able to stay the night without getting robbed, shot, stabbed, bedbugs, communicable diseases, or all of the above! We immediately called the main line to get our rooms back at the other location and deal with the issues there, but they had already given our rooms away. No idea why they sent us here other than that the management is in on illegal activity and taking advantage of suckers like us. DO NOT STAY HERE! WE ARE CHEAP, AND WE WOULDN'T EVEN STAY HERE FOR FREE!!!<//text>< pictures>

< review>
Last month I stayed there Sunday - Friday two consecutive weeks. I was a guy traveling on business without my family. It was reasonably clean and safe. Right next to the highway and next a reasonably priced grocery store. My first week on the top floor I got a good room. My only problem was that dishes don't come in the room but you ask for them. My first morning I ask and was told they would be delivered that AM. After work I had to ask again and they gave me a pile of dishes and a coffee maker to carry up so I could make dinner.

The breakfast is pretty sparse having granola bars, apples, oranges and oatmeal packets. The problem is most mornings the oatmeal was only regular flavor with nothing but the coffee sweetners to put in it. They had light roast, dark roast and water for tea or hot chocolate. No decaf but I could make it in my room when I had a coffee maker.

The second week I was on the middle floor. Still clean but I could hear every footstep above me and the recliner was broken. As I was checking in on Nov 1st I ask why they were sold out and was told it was Welfare check day and they always fill up that day. As I was unloading my cart I had a guy walking the hotel (rooms open to outdoors) offering to sell me a $10 "new" leather jacket. I almost flashed him my badge but he moved on when I said no.

I did have trouble getting dishes again. I got most the day of check in but was told there were no coffee makes available. Not a huge deal to head back to the police academy the next day with no decaf and got it the next day when I ask.  In this room I also had toilet problems that resulted in being handed a plunger from the desk at first, a visit by mantience the next day and getting to keep the plunger the rest of the week when problems returned.

That week we also had the Internet go out around lunch and it took them about 48hrs to get it up and working. Xfinity came out on that second day. At home when I call Xfinity in the evening they have fixed it that night or in the AM at the latest. I just upped the data on my cell. Cost a few bucks but with the cheap hotel price I was still ahead.

Overall I am rating it 3 stars as it was clean, safe, close to the police academy and cheap. It's no 3, 4 or 5 star hotel experience but it's an inexpensive place to stay. If you want the 4 star hotel you can pay $125/night in that area but I paid $75 with taxes and dealt with these things. I would still go back for the cost savings.</review>

My family and I have stayed at these hotels in the past and they were great, but this one is by far the worst experience we had. When we got here and checked in at 9 o'clock at night our room was dirty, and really worn down. So we moved into another room, it wasn't that much better but we dealt with it.< /Review>

One word....NASTY.  Feels like I'm in the projects.  Floor in my room was not vacuumed.  Bathroom has stains on the counters and tub.  And the corner of my dresser/tv stand was scotch taped to hold it together.  I checked out the next day.....looks nothing like the photos they post on the internet.</Review>

<Review>When we made our reservation we reserved a king room on a lower floor with our dog. They quoted me a price we agreed. When we checked in they had no king room for us put us on the top floor and charged us more for the dog. We very unsatisfied with this room and the added charges after being told a different amount.</Review>< pictures>

< Review>
The room was only partially cleaned. There was dried toothpaste and spit on the bathroom counter. There wasn't a blanket on the bed. The floor wasn't vacuumed very well. There was no microwave, coffee maker, or dishes. There was an iron but no board. There was barely any toiletries.</Review>

<Text>Cock roaches, bad plumbing, pictures falling off the wall are just the start. The clerk Travara, screws married men that stay there, another clerk provides weed to guests and a pimp provides hookers rooms to use. Pang the manager is ok with it all and even discriminates against the disabled. Wouldnt stay there again if it was free.< /Text>< user_id>

Sad that people that work here are to worried about making friends here than be professional and to do there job and be honest instead of ducking and dodging people and making excuses to not come in to work if your management isn't going in to work than your workers will do the same by your example Stacy Elliot you couldn't be me on your best day! And pang watch your back Stacy is gunning for your job!!!! 💯<//Review>

Location is okay but the rooms did not have a comfortable bed or hairdryer after checking in I came to find out that we didn't have any towels in the room besides one hand towel.< /review>

The hotel is very dirty. There are trash cans filled with garbage that doesnt appear to be emptied consistently (pregnancy tests, used condoms, etc were all seen). There were a LOT of people parked at the hotel and living in their vehicles with their pets. The rooms smell bad. We stayed in a non-smoking room and the smell (not cigarette smell) was horrible. We had to cover our nose in order to sleep. The pillows cases were wrinkled/creased as if they had just been used. There was visible stuff on the carpet that could have easily be vacuumed up. There were no towels in the bathroom and there was an open/used bar of soap sitting on the counter. I had an Expedia coupon so we only paid $30 for this $80 hotel and even then I feel that we paid too much. We checked in really late so we decided to not leave in the middle of the night but would have probably been more comfortable sleeping in our car. I do not recommend this hotel and I will not be staying at a Stay America again.</text>
