My massage was amazing my masseuse Arlene was wonderful she worked on my back where I was having most of my issues I felt wonderful after.
Everyone at massage elements was very nice and friendly the service was great.
It is nice and clean and very relaxing.
I love that you can become a member and you get discounted rates for you and a family member.
I highly recommend them I’m very pleased and happy with them.< /review>

Feels extremely safe during COVID. Love how helpful and kind the staff is. The massage therapist I had was incredible - really broke up the knots in my back and also shared some very helpful tips to help my back afterwards. The prices are very reasonable as well, especially the membership for those who need consistent massages. Great all around!< /Text>

First time getting a massage since covid. Receptionist was super friendly, the massage with Idris was exactly what I needed. Wasn’t expecting to, but became a member to take advantage of the lower rates. All in all a great experience. Would definitely recommend.</Text>

<Text>Being a professional that works long hours behind a desk and deals with customers I enjoy Elements' monthly massage program. Having a massage every month or a couple of times per month helps with decompressing the life stresses we encounter.  I highly recommend their monthly program for professionals that work long hours.<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmap_id>

Been here several times and this place is great and consistent!  Just got a massage from here today since my back and neck have been killing me the past month and I came out of the massage feeling better than I've had in a while!  Before your massage, the lady will ask what body areas to focus on and she'll massage those knots away - be aware that they use their feet quite a bit so the pressure can be quite hard for some people.<//text>

Alex, my massage therapist, is very professional and addresses all my concerns in an efficient and timely manner. She is hands down the best massage therapist I've ever had & is one of the reasons I come back to Elements. The other therapist I recommend is Arlene who is especially good at trigger point therapy.

Whitney was awesome! She is very skilled and made sure everything was exactly how I wanted it. I will definitely be visiting her again. The receptionist was very professional and sweet. She made sure I was comfortable, offered me water and asked if I needed to use the restroom before my session. The facility is clean, comfortable and inviting.< /Text>

This is my happy place. I've been a member about 3 years now. Most staff get to know you and know your needs and preferences. Request the right pressure for you or communicate what you do and do not like for the best match. If you can't get scheduled, ask to be on the waitlist for the right type of therapist.
The therapists here are very experienced and the best in Simi, if not beyond. The company must be run well enough to attract and keep very well trained, knowledge, and experienced therapists.
Thank God for this place. They've helped me heal more than physical therapy and even some doctors.<//text>

Arrived early to fill out paperwork, that way it didn't come out of my session time. Room was clean, peaceful and comfortable. Christina was amazing and crafted the perfect massage for what I needed.  I needed a mix of relaxing and deep tissue in certain areas and she accommodated any requests. The experience was wonderful and exactly what I needed. After my massage, Christina went above and beyond to teach me a few stretches to help with some of my chronic pain issues. The first two days afterwards, my body was a bit sore (expected) but now 4 days later it feels wonderful! Thank you Elements and Christina!< /Review>

When arriving I was greeted by the warm and welcoming reception ladies, the main waiting gave a relaxing feel, complete with soothing music, water fountain and complimentary cups of water for you to drink. Upon entering the massage room my masseuse was sure to be attentive, clear and always made sure my needs were met. After the best massage I have ever received I was offered a bottle of water and asked how my massage was, surely you can’t get this level of service from any other massage place. For a masseuse with soft and warm hands who knows her stuff ask for Samantha.<//review>

The massages are great!   I give 3 stars because I've always been given 90 minute gift cards,  they can only accommodate 60 minutes typically.   So, I've used 60 of the 90 minutes with the promise of using the leftover minutes.  They've never honored the remaining 30 minutes!  Don't purchase 90 minutes, it's a ripoff!</Text>

<Text>The front office people are warm, friendly, and helpful. I love that if you try a new massage therapist and it's not good, you can get another one with someone else for free.

He was complaining about how sore he was from playing basketball a couple days before and I guess I was just tired of hearing it. Cost me $50 but he received a full hour and he didn't have a single complaint. He really appreciated the fact that there was no pressure put on him or even a hint of "extra" services possibly being available. So if your with him and the other 2% of the male population, this is your spot. That was my attempt at humor. The 2% part;-)< /review>< pictures>

I was looking for a new place to reward myself with a massage. I visited Elememts Massage to try this facility out.  I have been back 3x and each time the service is great. They call you the day before to remind you of the appointment, (you can cancel as late as 7pm the day before your appointment) the facility is clean and the massage room is adequatey sized. They offer a hanger and clothes basket to place items in, along with an andes mint :)
My female masseuse that I've had is very professional, friendly and provides the right pressure in those tension spots, without making me sore the next day.
They also have a monthly program if you want to join and they will give you a discount on the massage price. They also provide aromotherapy and hot stone massages too.  I'm have been very pleased with the service I receive here.< /text>

This is the best place to get a massage in SoCal. The staff is extremely friendly, my massage always starts on time, and I don't feel rushed. The therapist are at the top of their game this is shown by their care and attention to your particular issue. I would highly recommend this Elements to anyone seeking a massage.</review>

Christina was excellent and I had the best massage I have had in many years.  I waited for less than a minute in the lobby before being taken to the massage room.</review>

<review>OMG Claudio has the magic hands I could hardly turn my head when I got there and he found the source and eliminated it. I have no brusing and no after pain today. It is as good as new he is also very concerned about the comfort level of the client and is very informative as to the advantages of Elements. Over all it was a great experience front desk staff professional and pleasant. The place is spotless and reassures you no buggyboos are lingering from the last client. I'm sure all of the therapist are as good as Claudio but I can only speak for my experience with him I will be returning again and again. Great Job.<//review><pics>None</pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmap_id>

<Text>My husband and I both had massages in the couples room.  We both felt that masseues, Desiree and  Gina were wonderful.  The massages for both of us were the perfect combination of soft and firm.  My husband stated he felt like a "wet noodle" and just wanted to go home and have a nap.  We were both amazed at how fast the 55 mins went.

The facility is beautiful and serene.  The staff are friendly and warm.   We live in Ventura (city of) and it was well worth the drive to have the massages and we have decided to make this a once or twice a month "habit" for us realizing how important it is for our mental state.<//Text><rate>5<//rate>< gmap_id>

I called to get some advise on repairing my built in oven. I had another company attempt to repair it and after spending a lot of money it’s still wasn’t fixed. I wanted assurance that they can handle the repair and would provide warranty. The person on the phone was patient and answered my questions. He completed the repair within the timeline he promised and had a working oven for turkey day. Good job guys!!</Text>

<review>George came out next day to fix my Samsung dryer in less than 15 mins. He had his parts in the truck and took apart the whole machine in 5 mins while I watched him. He pinpointed the faulty part and swapped it out. In and out in less than 20 mins. Great services!< /review>< response>

My refrigerator stopped cooling and I was already thinking I had to buy a new one. I found them on Yelp and with the good reviews it motivated me to call. On my first attempt I was able to speak with someone who scheduled an appointment to come out. He called me to give me an estimated time of arrival and showed up exactly within that time. He came in and quickly knew exactly what the problem was. He was very knowledgeable and worked very fast.  Great service. I will definitely use again if I need and reccomend to my friends.<//review>

What a nice service repair! I highly appreciated this company for providing me an excellent service and amazing technician who magnificently handles my refrigerator hinge problem. It was nice because the service they provided was thorough, and it puts back my appliance to its normal working. It was certainly a job well done for these guys! Truly efficient and effective!< /Text>

<review>Really good experiences the two times I’ve used this company, both times to repair my Viking refrigerator.  They have come out on time as scheduled, and it’s easy to communicate.

I have a condo in Irvine that came with a build in Ge monogram refrigerator. The door wasn’t aligned and was making loud noise as if it was going to fall off. I called Oc Appliance and they sent their technician right away to check out. They determined that the hinged needed to be replaced and ordered the part for me. He came back next day with the part and took care of the issue. Happy with the results. Efficient and easy guy.<//text>

My tenant called and complaining about noise coming from their refrigerator. I called and spoke to a very nice and kind lady to setup a house call to look at my tenants fridge. They arranged the time with my tenants and called me on the day of the appointment with diagnosis. Went with the repair and paid over the phone. Tenants were happy with the repair results and painless repair experience with orange coast.</Text>

<Review>Sean was our technician and he seems to know what he’s doing. Took apart our noisy dryer and found a faulty drive pulley and replaced. Cleaned out the inside as a courtesy and was on his way to his next call. Very fast and $$$ for the time spent. I guess you pay for expertise. They give 1 year warranty on their repair parts.</Review>< Gmap_id>

You know up front what the charges will be and they are competitively and fairly priced.

<text>They sent Mark to service my washer that was leaking from underneath. He couldn’t find the problem at first visit but he came back next day to check it out again. He found the pinhole leak and replaced the hose. The washer has been good ever since. Great workmanship and follow up.< /text>< Pictures>

This review is way overdue. I had used them 6 months ago for subzero repair. They rebuilt my cooling system and it seems to be running strong for almost 30 year old unit. Their princes were comparable to other companies the reason I went with them was because they had the part readily available and did the repair next day. I called box appliance and they seemed completely unprofessional and didn’t even want to take on the repair. It’s sad they’re the only company in SoCal that’s subzero authorized and they have no interest in working on 10+ year old units their loss.<//review>

George came out next day to fix my Samsung dryer in less than 15 mins. He had his parts in the truck and took apart the whole machine in 5 mins while I watched him. He pinpointed the faulty part and swapped it out. In and out in less than 20 mins. Great services!</text>

I needed someone to fix my kitchenaid refrigerator and thanks to google, I found these fine gentlemen.  They showed up right on time, gave me a very reasonable estimate which I accepted, and then fixed the fridge within a hour.  No pain whatsoever.  I found them to be very professional and would definitely use them again for any further appliance repair.  Highly recommend!<//Review>

I called OCA to schedule an appointment for my Samsung refrigerator. Unfortunately they do not work on them but they gave me advise on how to handle my issues as it was a common problem manufacturing defect with the units. I appreciate their honesty and didn’t try to send a tech to collect house call fee and say it wasn’t worth repairing.< /review>

Thank you for coming out and fixing my Viking fridge! I love my fridge and was really bummed out when it stopped working. I called around town and these guys knew how to work on my specific unit.

<text>Orange Coast Appliance continues to get 5 stars in my book. They stayed in contact while waiting for a part to come in and when the wrong one arrived, the technician  came by and jury-rigged my washer so I could use it while he waited for the right part. He has called with updates on that as well. I appreciate his curtesy and professionalism. I will not be using anyone else for my appliance repairs!< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

<Review>I found OC Appliance online and called them inquiring about potential Samsung dryer repair. The person on the phone was helpful and arranged a tech for in person diagnosis. Our tech was Mark. He gave me the diagnosis for the noisy dryer and I approved his estimate before he started. After the work was done he cleaned up after himself and even offered to vacuum inside my dryer for free of charge to prevent fires. I will definitely call them for any other appliance issue. P.s. the tech had a hard accident but he knew what he’s doing.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

In today’s age of covid with elderly parents it’s difficult to have people over at your house. I was in dire need for a technician to service my mother’s refrigerator in Laguna Beach. I called around few places online and went with them. The tech came to our house wearing mask and gloves and had shoe covers. Quickly diagnosed our refrigerator and fixed it same visit. The whole process to less than 45 mins and my parents were upstairs. Very fast workers.< /Text>

If your aging SubZero fridge has a problem, you cannot do better than Orange Coast Appliance Repair. They respond quickly, their techs have years of experience, and they locate and fix what's broken when other companies tell you it's hopeless. They charge a very fair price.  Orange Coast Appliance Repair fixed a permanently frozen drain hose which caused leaks and icing when other, larger companies told me it was the beginning of the end and to buy a new fridge.  Call them now!< /Text>

I first called them because I had used them for several years with things that had broke around my house. The gentleman fixed my dryer and left but when I went to use it the hot air filled my house so I called them and was told they would sent someone out and let me know what time. I waited for several hours and then called them back and was told they didn’t know exactly what time yet but would call me as soon as they did. I have wet clothes that sat for now two days and called another company to come and fix it. I called back and asked if they had been orange coast appliance in the past because their paperwork has a different name on it and they said yes. I also let him know that I would use him again and he didn’t even ask me why or care. I would not suggest anyone using them their customer service is Horrible along with their follow through if you have a problem.<//Text>

I called in for service this morning for emergency refrigerator repair and they were able to accommodate same day repair service. I really appreciate all their efforts to save our $400+ groceries. The price was reasonable and the tech knew exactly what was wrong with our 10 year old Kitchenaid fridge. They had the control board (discontinued) in their stock and they did the repair same day. All repairs come with 1 year warranty on parts replaced compared to other companies offering 90 days<//Review>

They are far from being professional.  In January we paid to have someone come out and fix our refrigerator, paid $175, for the call.  Few weeks later the same problem happened.  Called them back out, they came out, and assured us that it was fixed.  Couple of weeks later, happened again, said it would be an additional $100 because it was out of warranty. We paid it, again they assured us it was fixed.  Couple of weeks later, the problem happened again, this time they came out and said they needed to order a part, the part was going to cost $10, and they would contact us when the part came in.  A month later, we called them, and asked for our money back, shock of all shocks, the part came in.  We said no, we have learned to deal with the problem, and please refund our money.  Today we were told NO REFUND WAS DUE, BECAUSE THE PART WAS SO EXPENSIVE.  A $10 part, the problem is still not fixed, and now no one returns the calls.  They are HORRIBLE TO WORK WITH.  I plan on taking this complain as far as I can with the BBB, and the licensing board.</Review></record>

We had issues w our washer and dryer by LG and they took care of nicely. We have Thermador column built in freezer that had defrosting issue and seal problem. We waited 3 weeks for Thermador certified technicians to fix and they gave us run around and came unprepared after I had sent emails w photos they requested. They were supposed to remove custom wood door panel but after waiting three weeks the technician came with no knowledge of the job and said I need to call separate installer to take custom door panel off. I called Orange Coast and they came out removed door panel fixed problems with the parts I got from Thermador and reassembled nicely. I would highly recommend them.</text>

I went in for a short women's haircut. Although my hairdresser Joe was friendly, he did not consider the haircut I wanted. He didn't take the time to really look at the photos. I usually have it a bit shorter, and I curl the ends with moose. He cut nearly all of my hair away and I have something like a pixie cut now. He cut away the hair around my ears and now I have misshapen sideburns, and I expressed that I never cut the hair there. I feel so exposed and embarrassed. I am genuinely mortified at my appearance. I don't know what I can do but wait with nearly all of my hair gone. I am just so saddened by this whole experience I can't stop crying.< /review>

<Text>I hadn't had a haircut since a few months before covid, and my bangs had grown passed my chin. I finally came in and Joe did an awesome job making my hair and bangs look great. Super friendly. Thanks so much.

I also like that they did a temp check and hand sanitizer. Doing a great job with covid precautions</Text>< Pictures>

I was never a supercuts fan, but here I am writing this review.

Before me coming here, I would go to my local barbershop. Here are a couple of reasons why I switched over.

1. Long waiting line even up to 2hrs to get a haircut, although you called to book an appointment.
2. They only take cash, which is a hassle to waste time at the bank.
3. Some barbers like yapping instead of getting down to business and just cut hair.

Those are a couple of reasons why I come to Supercuts. They get down to business and charge around 20 bucks. At least at this location, when I book an appointment, I don't have to wait to get a haircut, but the most beautiful part of this is they accept debit cards which is a massive advantage for people like myself that hate wasting time at the ATMs.

I hope this helps persuade you, have a fantastic day!< /Review>

It’s fine. Good haircuts. Always in timely manner. It’s the price that bothers me. I actually can get my sons haircut cheaper with same quality elsewhere at a local barber. However their hours availability is very spotty forcing me to come here. They are dependable but prices are not competitive.< /review>

<Pics>None< /Pics><Review>Good place for a quick haircut. Price for male hair cut is 18$. They havent upgraded to a computerized listing system so a lot of the scheduling is done by paper and pencil. But they make up is speed and haircuts.

The layout looks like it needs a makeover but I dont mind it as long as the haircuts are wonderful. The feeling I get when I walk in is... Needs new carpets and brighten up the location with some colors besides neutral blue and grey.</Review><time>1545847804163</time>< GmapID>

< Review>
I've never gone to cut my hair at a salon where they didn't include washing your hair before your cut and then blow drying it after.  And all that is included in the price. Here, everything is charged separately and the guy gave me a weird look when he finished with my cut and asked if it looked ok. I said yes but aren't you going to blow dry my hair? He said oh that's extra.  So annoyed. No my hair looks greasy and gross. Thanks.  Not coming back.  And also it wouldn't hurt to clean your station before your next client and not have them step on the previous clients hair.  Just saying.</Review>

< Review>
I was satisfied, the service and cost were reasonable, and not like other barber shops who gouge their customers with outrageous prices for a trim.. My neighbor paid $45 for a trim and his hair was already short.. Let our memories remember these company's in the future and take our business elsewhere.. Covid 19 is no excuse for rip off.. Supercuts maintains good customer relations despite this pandemic..😃< /Review>

<text>Was shocked to hear that they don't let you change your subscription.
I started off with 2 units and reduce my fleet to 1.  Was surprised about my payment notice with no notification.  Overall the company was great to start with and have a good system but this not changing your subscription is why I give them 1 star.  Be careful what you sign up for.  Feels like they are behind the times and need to catch up.< /text><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

Paid upfront for a whole year, never really used it since I was working just in California I was using paper logs. Called to cancel and was shocked to find out they wouldn’t refund me back my money.when I received the device they disinterested send the Y- Cable they tried to charger me $60 to send one to me. I told them that if they didn’t send me that wire free of charger I would cancel, they did send me one.  They tried to sell me other services that they offer. Stay away from this KeepTruckin. I wouldn’t recommend this Company not even to my enemies lol....

< Review>
Zack Clutter in sales was the reason I didn't do business with you guys. He was extremely rude. The call started with good conversation and lots of information but at the end that changed. He explained and offer where I pay the $35 monthly subscription upfront for a whole year equalling $420 payment. This got me the device ($150) at no charge. When I called him back to his number to get the service, first he didn't answer my call I had to reach him by calling the sales number and waited until I got routed to him. I was ready to proceed with the purchase but wanted to make sure that after "A whole year" up front payment I could downgrade my plan to the $20... He said that he told me that it was a 2 year contract, which politely I said that he never mentioned that... He then started to get rude about it. He boasted that he record the conversation... insinuating he doesn't make mistakes. I told him to play the recording.... we listened to it and indeed he never mentioned that the offer was for a 2 year contract. He then started taking to me like if I was stupid and suggesting I "writing things down so I don't forget". Unacceptable to say to anyone you intend doing business with.  Because of Zach Clutter, you just lost a lot of potential customers in the Charlotte market.<//Review>

< Review>
The dashcams repeatedly don't work, the eld device constantly loses signal/ service creating HUNDREDS (depending on the fleet size) of unidentified driving occurrences, there is no way to edit a special driving event, there is no way to insert a past duty status if you  need to use PC Off Duty, the support team tries but are unable to help and this company has wasted so much of my time.  We have a medium sized fleet and there are problems every single day.  EVERY DAY.  Also, the trial we went through doesn't accurately reflect once you are up and running on their platform.  There are issues we didn't have in the trial that we now experience DAILY.</Review>

Even a star is a waste.
The entrepreneurial spirit is dirty.
Renewal without the consent of the customer.
When my company closes, the amount of the remaining period is not returned.
It is the company rule to receive one year's expenses at once, and the company rule not to return it even if you stop using it. Every employee on the phone promises to work unresponsibly and reply, and there is no answer.
I also emailed it, but there is no answer.
Dirty company. If the pendemic is over and you run the company again and need to use ELD, you will not use it again.< /review>

Again, zero stars.

We are very dissatisfied with their services. We cancelled our subscription, were charged for the next year (had to call and reverse that), and finally asked can we please please please never talk or speak to each other again, okay? Sure enough, a couple months later we receive a letter in the mail from a collection agency — repeat, a collection agency — saying Keep Truckin’ filed a claim against us. Turns out, their ELD boxes are leased to our company on an agreement (news to us — they’ve been collecting dust in our garage for the last six months and we’d gladly return them), but instead of Keep Truckin’ clearly communicating this to us, especially as we are canceling our contract, they chose to stay silent and wait. Then, when our credit card number was no longer valid, decided to submit our bill to a collection agency for a total lease price of more than the ELDs are worth, dragging our company name through the mud in the process. There was no warning, no phone call, no email (even though that was their excuse... “Did you get our email?”) and especially, no manners. By the way things unfolded it seems like this is their standard business model: stay silent until the former customer trashes the ELDs, then charge them for it — a nice way to boost the bottom line.

Normally, we’d refrain from writing a negative review to knock a company, however this “play dumb and be nice” way of doing business is everything our company stands against. And sadly, this story is only the tip of the iceberg. Future buyers beware — Keep Truckin’ are bad vibes just dressed nice. Two HUGE thumbs down.

Also, we returned the ELDs and called them to say please take our name off the creditor list and KT agreed and said yes. One month later can you guess what happened? That’s right — nothing. When you call, you will never reach a decision-maker. They are a big waste of our time and money. On the bright side, dealing with Keep Truckin' has reminded us how to never treat a customer, and for that we are grateful.< /review>

An email between myself and one of the Keeptruckin salesmen after I'd had enough. Mind you, I have been trying to add an asset tracker to my account via phone calls, chat message, and emails for weeks with no reply when Lukas Gates finally called me to complete the order.

To Lukas;

Yet another lie from you and your company.

On the 3rd you took my order and promised to have and agreement in my email within 30 minutes, that never happened. I had no communication for 2 days then you call and say I need to do a DocuSign ASAP. After prodding you say you'll eat the overnight if I go through with the order for the inconveniences associated with the order process. On the 9th, when I got back into town, I did your DocuSign, on the 10th you said I'd have it by the 11th. You charge my credit card for the device and overnight shipping, which I did not authorize and you personally said I would not be charged for, then, after being confronted about the charge, subsequently claimed you'd refund the charge to my card which I haven't seen yet. The device didn't even ship until the 11th and as of this email I don't have it.

You and keeptruckin should be ashamed of yourselves. Lie, after lie, after lie.

This is every interaction I've had with keeptruckin. Someone needs to learn the trucking industry about your business practices.</Text>

<text>"0" Stars if possible.  My elog company went under because of COVID-19.  Keep Truckin's sales representative Oscar contacted me and was very confusing about the actual price of the service and required a 3 year contract.  I clearly told them I did not want their service and not to call me.  Have been getting calls 2 or 3 times a day since March from them, it is now August.  Uses fake caller ID numbers sometimes too, so blocking is not successful.  They are clearly harassing and annoying.  Find another eld company, you'll be glad you did.  Garmin has "0" monthly fees.  Check them out and keep trucking, just not with these guys.<//text><username>Simione Transport, Inc<//username><rating>1< /rating>< response>

I am owner of 20 trucks , agreed with Alistair Ryle on price $45 for each truck for dash camera and ELD . For some reason Keeptruckin is charging me $65 per truck .
So we are talking about thousand dollars per year .
I called them multiple times them and every time they are saying they will find whats going on and call me back .
Nobody called me back so far !  its been almost a year !

KeepTruckin as app is good,
But as a company not so good!
If you paid full for 12 months upfront for your ELD and don’t wanna use it in the future it will be difficult to get refund for the rest of the months.<//review>

Let me start off by saying if it were a option there would be no stars filled in. The absolute professional experience. We are a small company with 2 trucks and 2 drivers. Customer service is horrible and a waste of time. They give untruthful excuses time and time again. All calls were not tracked and reported, call backs with resolutions are non existent. Finally after 6 months I received a call from our sales rep. While he did help escalate the issue for a resolution he did not do what he said he would do by fixing the logs. As anyone who is looking into these eld system knows how crucial it is to have accurate and up to date books due to the laws and regulations. I called him today 05/17/19 and asked him why the logs were updated since it has been three days and he transfers me to someone, aka their mainline to handle the issue myself yet again. after waiting on hold and specifically telling the representative what is needed and what he needed to do he still at this point could not comprehend the task being asked of him. No its not just this one person either. Every single person I've spoke to had the same issue. I feel this may be due to the language barrier, because when you call not one person speaks English. I ended up ending that phone call and calling back to speak to someone else. at this point i requested a manage as soon as the person greeted me. the manager who answered tried doing the trouble shooting and run around AGAIN! I quickly ended this and told him what he needed to do to correct the problem. He then told me the previous manager that was supposed to call me back never recorded the call so there was no record of him supposed to be calling back when the systems were back up. this is one of the many horrendous experiences with this company. for $360/ truck per year this is insane! at this point my problem still is not resolved and my sales rep is not answering phone calls.</text>

<Review>We get the service as AOBRD, their app wasn't AOBRD compatible. We just wasted money, on top of that upon multiple requests failed to provide Return Authorization so we can return all the hardware, instead they STEAL money on our inactive Credit Card.

Unfortunately I cant rate them with 0 starts. My problem with them is with the billing. I returned 2 devices, I received an email from them that they have received the devices and for the past 25 days they claimed that they have received just one devices and refund for just one is processed. Eddie Wallace was the agent I was talking with.</Text>

Eld caused my engine shut down light to come on. After loosing two days of work in the shop and $304.00 for shop to confirm that it was caused by the eld. Then a few days of talking on the phone with KT finally a new one has been shipped to me. Thinks they should pay for lost days work and the shop bill. Like the eld other than that. Want five stars? Reimburse my lost money from eld problems.  Up date as of 3/28/19 Support from KeepTruckin has turned out to be great! They sent me a new ELD and then reimbursed me the $304.70 for truck being in the shop for ELD related problem. Only thing is the new ELD as of two days ago started causing the same problem. STOP ENGINE Light coming on unhooked the ELD and it goes off and does not come back on.   UPDATE 6/25/19 Everything is great now KT paid me back for the shop fees and sent me a new eld that was made for my truck model.  Still using it now and no problems. Nice to see a company that stands behind there product and makes things right. Thank you Keep Truckin.< /text>

Terrible company! Charged me 1.50 for the decals to put on your truck, but the kicker is the 9$ they charged me to mail them to me. Then I'm canceling service because I don't need it. They want me to pay to mail their device back to them. I had to pay 12$ for them to mail it to me, now I gotta pay again to mail it back. Plus no refund on my unused subscription.  They are completely out for themselves,  don't care about customers.<//text>

The app is easy to use. The initial set-up with the ELD was a nightmare. But a few weeks later and several phone calls to customer support, we got it working. The customer service reps are really hard to understand, which makes calling them dreadful. I would recommend installing the ELD way before the December deadline.< /Review>

The Customer Support is Horrible they are an over seas company that they use to answer all the phones calls. You can Hardly understand them. The Maps on the desktop to use to watch your trucks is horrible its slow and you can not see exactly where your truck is if it goes over the same route during the day. Not to mention the ELOG changes the drivers status without him knowing with no warning at all. Called to cancel and get my money back. Ronnie on the retention team told me he would refund my money once I sent the devices back to them. So I sent the devices back to them and he told me if I did not see the refund in a few days to call back in. 2 weeks have went by and no REFUND on almost 1000.00 dollars.. I have been calling in everyday for the past 2 weeks and customer support answers and tells me everytime that they will have someone from the retention team call me back. THEY ARE LYING AND GIVING ME THE RUN AROUND. DO NOT GET KEEPTRUCKIN.

We ordered an ELD, spent over $200 for it and now it’s not showing up in our online account so we can’t use it. Customer service is horrible. They have been giving us the run around for weeks and weeks. No solutions and always say they will call us back and never do. Still can’t use the ELD and feel like we have been ripped off! Shame on them for essentially stealing from small businesses and hardworking men and women. Don’t order from them!<//Text>

We've had difficulty with the Keep Truckin application and hardware since installation in January.  The system is designed to transmit all GPS data through the driver's phone, which is unreliable.  Aside from this GPS transmission design flaw the hardware does not automatically move our driver from "on duty" status to "driving" status.  Do not use this company or application.< /text>

I would stay away.
I have been quoted different prices by two different people in the sales department.
To make things worse, they called me at 5:55am to complete and sales call.

WHO THE HECK CALLS AT 5:55am to try to complete a Sale.

STAY AWAY... they are hard up for money.
Just reading all these bad reviews now....</review>

(Translated by Google) Eld's worst company
The customer service in Spanish will call you back when it suits them if you talk to them to buy some service the first call they answer. But if you need help with an established account until they are answered. And it turns out in my case that owner operators are added to my account and more boxes are ordered and when they withdraw and you want to remove the boxes from your account they tell you that you have to pay it until it ends according to said contract. Contract that they tell you when you start the account that it is only the previous version when they rented the boxes. They want to make money at the expense of the carriers 0 recommended 👎

(Original)
La peor compania de eld
El servicio al cliente en español te regresan la llamada cuando les conviene si les ablas para comprar algun servicio a la primer llamada te contestan. Pero si nesesitas ayuda ya con una cuenta establecida asta que se les inchan contestan. Y resulta en mi caso que se añaden owner operators a mi cuenta y se ordenan mas cajas y cuando ellos se retiran y quieres quitar las cajas de tu cuenta te dicen que tienes que pagarla asta que termine segun dicho contrato. Contrato que te dicen cuando empiesas la cuenta que es solo la version anterior cuando ellos rentaban las cajas. Kieren hacer dinero a costillas de los carriers 0 recomendable 👎<//Text>

Had a wonderful experience with this company. Was looking for someone for a weekend. Even with short notice they had someone to our house the next morning. Claudia was wonderful and stayed and worked on people for 5 hours. She was able to transition between doing softer massages for our pregnant ladies and harder massages for the old men.

Thank you so much again. A++ experience.</review>

One of the best massages I’ve ever had!
I was able to book a next day appointment and Zac was every prompt in responding. My massage therapist Shannon clearly knew what he was doing as he found tight areas I didn’t know existed! He adjusted the pressure in those tighter areas as well which I appreciate. The combination of being able to receive a massage in your own home and the relaxing and calming effects of the CBD/THC oil they use is priceless. Great customer service through the entire process. I’ll definitely be booking myself another one and giving gift cards/credit to friends and family!<//review>

I had been longing for a massage since Covid arrived and am so grateful for Traveling Hands to be open now to relieve some tension and pain! I would recommend Amanda’s massage work to all of my friends and family. Having them come to me is the most convenient way to go! The massage oil used is really nice. I was able to text to set up an appointment within a week’s time.<//text>

Highly recommend! The whole process was great. Easy to book and convenient. The massage was the perfect way to begin my day. I feel so much better from it. My body can actually move freely. My massage therapist was wonderful with working on areas of my body I needed extra work on. I will definitely book again!<//Text>

Great job! I hurt my neck and really needed a massage from someone that was knowledgeable about injuries. I felt so much better after the massage. Plus, it was so great having it done in the comfort of my own home. I recommend traveling hands! Thanks so much</Text>

Zac was quick in response to setting up an appointment for me on the next day.  Erica was really great, very nice and professional. She gave a fantastic overall massage and an exceptional head massage. I highly recommend her! Having this service come to your home is the only way to go. So convenient.</Review>

What a wonderful experience! Kelsey is an amazing professional with strong but gentle hands for my deep tissue massage. She was very concerned about my individual needs for my back and neck and took the time to work on them. She has reduced the pain and inflammation in my body.

He was quick to respond, courteous and thoughtful to ask if I preferred a male or female. Shanna was incredibly respectful, kind, and fantastic at what she does!

I’ve had a few sessions with traveling hands and they always do a phenomenal job! Today I had a session with Chris and he exceeded expectations. I never ever write reviews lol but felt it was necessary. This is the only place I call for my full body / back massages. Amazing work, they come to you which I’m my opinion is great because I am in the comfort of my own home while getting a great massage. Highly recommend!</text>

This was an amazing experience. We had two lovely therapists come to our home and give us each the most amazing THC infused massages. It was great to learn they use a full spectrum massage oil. Our therapists were wonderful, professional, down to earth and masters of their craft. Please do yourself a favor and book as soon as possible.</Text>

I appreciate Zac so very much.  My 90 year old mom agreed to try a massage to help with neck and back pain.  He was able to arrange the therapist right away.  The therapist, Nedra, was wonderful.  She was helpful to my mom, understanding this was her first massage.  My mom felt the massage was so helpful she now plans monthly massages with a traveling hands massage therapist.<//Text>

His company, Traveling Hands, uses full spectrum plant extract in their massage oil which has helped my husband and I relax even more during our massages. The oil works on soothing your body as the massage helps seal the deal. Traveling Hands will work with you to find your right fit for a massage therapist and has wonderful pricing! I’m a hard case, with all my health issues and bad experiences with massage at other places, and found myself able to enjoy my massages! This company makes each and every patient feel appreciated and cared about, and even comes to you!< /review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

Traveling Hands Massage is the way to go. I've never had a company come to my home for a massage, and it's the epitome of comfort. When the massage is over, you're already home and can continue to relax. Definitely recommend Traveling Hands!<//text>

I would highly recommend Traveling Hands Massage.  Zac was fantastic is communicating with me and booking services for my mom and I and our massage therapists (Shannon and Cynthia) were absolutely wonderful and skilled.   Both therapists were extremely friendly and on-time. The CBD was such a nice benefit and made our experience perfect.  It’s also great that they come to you and their responsiveness and care made me feel valued and important.  I also thought they were extremely reasonably priced.</text>

<Text>Booking with Traveling Hands is speedy, easy, and efficient. The text to confirm your appointment, and accept multiple forms of 21st century payment.

Cynthia was my massage therapist and she did an outstanding job. She worked on some areas I didn’t even realize were an issue. And her knowledge of the muscles and cause of my pain we’re spot on. She even imparted some wisdom to keep me on the right track between massages. Thank you thank you!

Last but not least, the best part is the oil/lotion they use and not having to leave my home. Great experience all around.</Text><user_name>Serena Shoup< /user_name>< time>

My husband is not a "spa" person, but has been asking for an in-home masseuse for a few years. I finally found the perfect service! When I called, Zach was extremely responsive and patient with all my questions about "how it works." Bob just had his first massage with Erica and it was a fantastic experience for him. I just purchased a package, and I'm sure I'll add myself into the mix soon. :)</review>

Everything about my massage experience was top notch. It was one of the best gifts I could have given myself and I am so grateful that they accommodated in the most professional and skillful ways.  I’ve been working as a practitioner for over 20 years so I know my stuff and this went above any “expectations”. Can’t wait to book again!</review>

Came to OB for a vacation and was needing some work on my back w all of the walking around we did for 3 straight days. Was such a great experience and very glad I got word of them. They came to my hotel, set up shop, brought relaxing music, ensured that the pressure was nice and kept the atmosphere relaxing. Price very reasonable, the masseuse very well educated. I’ld recommend using the infused which is optional. It never altered my mind but defin allowed my muscles to feel a release. The price is very reasonable and it was an overall great experience. Wish they were local to me.<//review>

<review>First off, I just want to say that I cannot say enough about the insane level of comfort Traveling Hands has provided! I am skiddish about massages in general, but the therapists here go above and beyond to maintain a professionalism I haven't really experienced in other areas of San Diego. Every massage I have received here has been so incredibly relaxing and I would absolutely recommend this massage option for anyone in San Diego! Always on time, professional, and so incredibly accommodating that is really takes the experience to a whole different level. Thank you traveling hands!!!!!!</review>< Resp>

I want to give huge praise to this whole company, and notably to my therapist Arthur. It was absolutely the best massage I've ever received, and I think it was both in part to his skills as well as the wonderfully unique method of using CBD oil. I slept better that night than I have in months! I'm excited to refer as many friends as I can (discounts for all!)!!</Review>

Amazing experience and I highly recommend using Traveling Hands in San Diego. Stephanie did a spectacular job on the massage and Zach’s communication and customer service was unmatched.</review>

<Text>I got a massage from Brandy today and it was the best massage I've ever had! I admit, I'm cheap so I've always just gone to the place that has the best deal. What a difference it makes when you go to a quality, licensed massage therapist!!! It's definitely worth the little bit of extra $. I also love that they use CBD oil, it really does help with the pain! I will definitely be a regular customer!</Text>< pictures>

<Text>Zac and his fellow masseuse were both very professional and good at their job, which is a therapeutic massage experience. Service was prompt, professional and friendly. Definitely an anniversary splurge for us to have an onsight couples massage. I'm actually interested in throwing a massage party in Orange county. If friends are interested in getting a great massage or hosting, let me know. 😁</Text>< Date>

Zac at Traveling Hands is wonderful! He is highly professional, friendly and exceptionally skilled with his hands. I've had many massages from different therapists over the years, and Zac stands out amount the best. The various special oils they offer are awesome, or you can opt for the traditional massage oil/lotion. He comes right to my office, and by the time he's finished I always feel a million times better. Highly recommend!< /review>

I love a good massage and this was definitely one of, if not THE, best one I have ever received! Brandy was able to identify all of my trouble spots, including ones I didn't even realize I had, and adjusted pressure throughout the massage based on my body's response without me even having to say anything.  I have had massages in the past that either didn't do much or left me sore the following day, but this was perfect - relaxing, soothing, and no soreness after.  I got the massage after a big hiking and camping trip so my body was tired and my muscles tense and the oil was also very soothing and relaxing. I felt amazing for days after!  Also, with two kids, it's sometimes hard to make time for self care but having Traveling Hands come to our home made it so much easier! All around, I could not have been happier with the service or the results!!<//Text>

<text>I came to La Jolla for a 4 day convention and by the 2nd day I was having pinching pain in my neck so I decided to get a massage. I messaged a couple places but everything was booked since it was so last minute. Zac replies back really quickly and was able to direct me to the website to request a session. Shanna was my massage therapist and she was very nice! My hotel room was on the second floor so I felt bad she had to carry that huge bed up. The foldable bed was very stable and she was very virtuous of the space we had. I had ordered food before she got there so I let her know that postmates was coming, she offered to help me retrieve the food and set it on the table when they get here so I don't have to get up and get dressed and get undressed again. Which I thought it was a very nice thing for her to do. My food never came though.... I'm not much of a talked so she didn't really try to make conversation. The massage was good and I think the cbd oil really helped with the pain I was feeling because I didn't feel it for a couple hours after she left. It was my first time trying cbd so I didn't know what to expect but will definitely look into getting some for myself to use on sore muscles. Overall I highly recommend their services!<//text><Pics>None</Pics><Response>{'time': 1550156925634, 'text': 'Hey Erica, thanks for trying us out.

She found me at the little Air BnB cottage I am staying at and gave an excellent massage with the cannabis infused oil. A massage with these oils was a first for me and because I get frequent massages I know that the oils bright me to a "new realm of raxation" during the massage. I was pain free for a few hours but the relaxation I experienced lasted for many hours. I hope that cannabis infused oil for massage therapy will become more widely available. It was an excellent experience and would highly recommend it!<//Review>< pictures>

<text>Like many of you out there I was sceptical and a little nervous to receive a massage using CBD. I was pleasantly surprised to realize it's just an oil used in the massage like all other massages! Only in this massage the benefits went deeper then just relaxation. The chronic inflammation in my knee and constant tightening in my neck disappeared. I literally felt like a new person.  They were so polite and professional. I can't wait for my next massage and now that I've experienced the difference I can never go back. I found my forever massage home!<//text><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>{'time': 1502054625352, 'text': "Thanks Frankie!

<rate>5</rate><Text>Zac saved my life after I woke up with a pinch in my neck after years of holding work stress in my shoulders. I first went to my physician who prescribed nerve medication, a muscle relaxer and hydrocodone. While living for days in the fetal position, I quickly realized I could not function or run my two businesses while loaded up on drugs, and needed an alternative. I had heard about CBD from friends but had never given it a try, so I thought what the heck. I found this company online, and Zac came out the next day. In two weeks I was back to status quo. The combination of skilled massage along with the therapeutics of CBD oil quickly relaxed my nerves and well being. I highly recommend these services and Zac who is a tremendous person that is passionate about his company and his products.</Text><pics>None<//pics><Resp>{'time': 1516945248612, 'text': 'Thanks so much, Teri!

It is a little bit cold in there but they give you a light blanket to cover yourself.  There are no frills so if you are looking for luxury this is not the spot for you.< /Review>< pictures>

All the pain in my feet and legs is gone and the head and face reflexology was a delight. Will be returning soon with any friends or family I can talk into it.

My mom and I were down at the farmers market and stopped by here after for what we thought would be a quick foot massage. I was impressed as it was a lot more than expected. They put us in big comfy chairs and actually respectfully massaged our entire body. They know TuiNa massage techniques which is a traditional Chinese massage in which I’m trained. The feet soaking with the head massage was delightful. Felt great when we left! 🤗🙏 cash Only and don’t forget to include the tip!< /review>

I did a 90-minute foot body combo. It was good, but not wonderful. the language barrier with the massage therapist made it difficult to be specific during the massage. Also, many of his methods seemed a bit random and amateur. There was a lot of muscle pinching.

Customer service was good and the environment is nice inside this space. Car very likely to be broken into if parked on the street. Don't leave anything visible.< /Review>

<text>Called for a last minute reservation and they were able to squeeze me in.  $50 for a 75 minute massage.  45 minute foot massage, and a 30 minute back massage.  The first part of the massage is in an open area.  It's odd to me that you get up go into another room to finish off your back.  I usually know what I'm expecting at these kind of massage places.  Essentially, you get what you pay for.  Most massage places like this are $30-$40 for a 1 hour massage.  15 minutes more for $10-20 more was not worth it for me.  Although their customer service was fine, the actual massage itself was awful.  I had so much pain the next day.  My back was completely bruised up.  I had tears running down my eyes during the massage.  I had to tell him several times please do it softer.  The first half of the massage they did my feet, legs, head and arms.  That part of the massage was fine.  The 2nd half of the massage you go into another room and take your clothes off to get your back done.  It was pure agony and pain.  I kept looking at the clock waiting for it to be over.  Unfortunately I will not return.</text>< pictures>

Clean relaxing environment with nice ambiance. I wish I remembered the name of the woman who gave me my massage cuz I'd love to have her again. Very standard, fair pricing I only paid $35 and that's including tip. Receptionist is very nice as well. If you don't like to make simply make an appointment.

<review>Couldn't have been happier to stubble into this place. $35 for foot reflexology, back, and neck massage; 60 mins. They also had $45 for just back. There is nothing private about this space as many of the massages are done in one large room. But if you aren't looking for the spa experience and just want a good rub down, this place is the best for the right price.</review></record>

<text>I was surprised to learn the full body massage was in nude (under the towels of course ) as most of these places do full body with clothes on. But it was one of the best massage I ever had. $45 full body and I gave $15 for tip which I believe is fair given how great the massage was.</text><gmap_id>0x808f80b6f05dce6f:0xef7753614316c6e0</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>
<Review>I should have known better! *In brief: They  literally injured my spine. *Company response: We'll give you a few Accupuncture visits to help....I went for them, had some minor very temporary relief for maybe 20 minutes after each, then hurt again. *Details: I've had Chinese massages for years, and usually go to another place in Oakland.  But, sometimes for variety, I try other places.  Here at Angel Feet, the practioner used deep and somewhat painful pressure.  She said, don't worry about it, that it's healthy long-term, rather than just comfortable short-term.  So, since I'm a believer in the long-term benefits of a good massage, combined with the seeming credibly of being co-located in an Accupuncture office, I "trusted" her.  In hindsight, her move that caused my spine injury was when, I was on my stomach, she "with strength" lifted my leg, high & hard above my back.  I again said, that it hurt a lot..but she reminded me that it is supposed to.  Well, after leaving, approximately 2 hours later I was still in pain, which then continued to get worse.  The next morning, I had trouble getting out of bed.  When I stood up for any length of time, it hurt more.  This pain continued for months.</Review><userid>107175044219854752536<//userid><gmapID>0x808f80b6f05dce6f:0xef7753614316c6e0</gmapID><Name>Me W.</Name><rate>1</rate><Date>1559082317702< /Date>< response>

<text>My fiance and I always come get a massage and enjoy it every time. All the time we are there our favorite guys that we request is always gone🤦. It's very upsetting but the new guys that are there we always try but this last time we went in two weeks ago, Bruce and Michael helped us. Bruce was very good but as for Michael, my fiance said he was gone 70% of the time. He sat on the arm rest the times he so call massaged her, also he was pooting around(that's disgusting and rude). He just put pressure on her body instead of massaging. Lastly, we always give our massagers a great tip and it upset me because we gave him 5 dollars as a tip and he questioned it? First of all I did not need to give you anything but I did out of kindness. If anyone knows where Tom and Billy went, it would be nice because they we're very generous.<//text>< Date>

The prices are what brings me back, they do a $35hr. leg n foot massage thats really more than just the feet. They also offer $40 hr. back massage as well, I usually do both. Beware tho you really have to speak up about the pressure they apply as its easy to get beat up here otherwise. So tell them soft or medium and make sure to speak up if its too hard, they tend to rub on the hard side.
Also my tip is to call ahead for a reservation (big plus if you speak an asian language) and ask them where to park as they offer a discount if you park in the parking lot they work with.<//review>

<username>Matthew Strickland music 101<//username><review>It's is a relaxing environment where you can get a massage and reflexology treatment for 35 bucks an hour.  The start wit a hot foot soak and pressure point facial massage.then they do your feet ,arms,neck and shoulders
.most of the time you need an appointment but you can get walk in treatment sometimes.  The old men are the best reflexoloigists ,if it is therapy you need. The room is quiet and relaxing.  I almost always fall asleep. It is a great way to beat traffic while treating yourself to a relaxing evening. Then it is nice to take a walk through China town and have a bite to eat or do some grocery shopping.  On Friday there is a farmers market on 9th and Broadway.  There are many authentic Asian restaurants quite close . Great dim sum may be had. On the other side of Broadway near 9th and Washington can be found some tap rooms and some great eating in the Swan market complex. That market offers a butcher shop with a truly epic selection of brats and sasauges.  The fish market has some deals too.< /review><Response>{'time': 1516221000221, 'text': "Matthew, thank you!

Nexgen and team were great and were very understating and accommodative from get go .  Carlos  fixed the issue in no time and he was very good at explaining the problem and future maintenance tips. Zach's diagnosis was right on too.<//Text>

<Rating>5</Rating><Review>I highly recommend NEXGEN as they were top notch in every aspect.  I was quickly scheduled for a walk though with Zach as we discussed an entire HVAC replacement to replace the original (27 years old) that came with the house.  Zach was on time, professional, courteous, and knowledgeable.  He gave me options and explained the pros/cons of each.  He sent Gustavo to my house the following day to ensure that the install I requested, could be performed.  After Gustavo's walk through, we scheduled the install which was predicted to take 3 days.  Gustavo's team was amazing!  3 days later, install complete.  I was given a tour of the entire system to allow a self inspection.  Gustavo handed me all of the installation/operator's manuals and went over them in detail.  Final step was pairing my phone with the Ecobee thermostats that were also installed...took about 5 minutes.  System performed flawlessly and I can't even describe how much better this system is than the old system (but based on age...I'm sure you get my point).  Zach checked in with me regularly during the install to ensure things were going smoothly.  Once complete, Zach scheduled his final walk though and debrief.  NEXGEN hit it out of the park!!!!<//Review>< Pics>

<review>I am very thankful, grateful, and exceptionally pleased with NexGen HVAC & Plumbing. I ditto similar reviews with respect to their superior ability to provide quality diagnostic, assessment and estimate of the ac/heating unit on the day of their visit. Their professionalism and expertise exceeded my expectations. This Company is Outstanding.  Their employees are very polite, professional, highly skilled, thorough sales representative and technicians.  Terrence was prompt, professional, extremely efficient, thorough in assessing and evaluating my ac/heating unit. Thank you, Terrence.  Tim Eagleson was absolutely amazing, kind, caring, very professional, prompt, conscientious, extremely knowledgeable, and in doing so, thoroughly provided detailed information regarding system units specifications, warranties, options, etc... He exhibited exemplary care and concern regarding my heating AC/Heating needs while thoroughly describing the various options and specs. The AC technicians, Gustavo and Arturo also were Outstanding.  They arrived promptly, very professional, covering the floors leading to the work area, and performed quality work in installing the Heating and AC unit to include thermostat.  The AC runs perfectly distributing cool air evenly to both the 1st and 2nd floor.  What a relief!!! The AC technicians thoroughly cleaned up after the installation. I sincerely appreciated the immediate follow-up from the company after the installation was completed.  I received both a text and phone call.  I gave a rating of 5 Outstanding.  Needless to say, as you can see from my review that I am extremely pleased and happy with the work from NexGen  HVAC and Plumbing.  I highly recommend them.  Thank you again, Tim, Terrence, Gustavo and Arturo.  You're the best!!!!</review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

Recently my a/c was having some issues and i contacted NexGen to come out and check it out...my technician Zach came out and explained thoroughly what the issue was. He was helpful and took the time to answer all my questions and i appreciate that...my a/c was fixed that same day
I recommend them 100% this business is honest and reliable (which is very hard to find these days)
Thank you Zach!!! (He was a cutie too 😉)</text>

<text>I had issues with my unit. It was just blowing air ( good thing it was cold) so we decided to call Next Gen to come out and give us a quote. The tech Zach came out and explained the issue. I was impressed with the level of professionalism and knowledge. Long story short our unit is working again. Thank you Zach for all your help! Hopefully, I don’t have to call you soon :-)</text>< pictures>

I absolutely appreciated the service I received from the Nexgen Technician. Robert Ramos was professional, showed pictures and explained the entire process and the services that were completed in a  clear manner of understanding. I signed up for the membership program which will benefit me greatly to keep up the maintenance. I look forward to working with Nexgen and TOTALY recommend their services!</text>

< review>
AC went out in the middle of the heatwave. I called and schedule appointment but they were booked for the following week. Completely understandable. Finally service tech came after about 10 days. He spent a couple of minutes looking into the panels. First question to me was “Do you like fire?” I said “NO”. He said “then, you got big problem”. He gave me 2 options, the cheap way was for him to redo the wirings to the compressor, total cost $1060 BUT will not guarantee it will solve the problem. The second option was to replace the compressor, total cost $5000, that’s right, $5000. I respectfully declined both and paid the “diagnostic” fee.
Called an independent tech (his own boss). He came out the next day. It turned out the contactor relay needed to be replaced. He left and came back within an hour with the new part. Total cost for his service $36 for parts and $133 for labor. The total was $170 and change. I know we’re in a middle of a pandemic and businesses have to make money, and taking advantage of the heatwave but that was brutal. PLEASE SHOP AROUND BEFORE YOU AGREE TO DO ANY REPAIRS< /review>

I was having issues with my heater and was recommended to call Nexgen. Called and received an appointment to have someone come take a look, not only did I get the evaluation done, service was also completed by the end of day. Great service and amazing turn around time!<//review>

Recently had Nexgen Air come to replace our furnace, install a new thermostat, and provide maintenance for our AC unit.  The technician that helped us was Sal, and he was great!  Very responsive to our calls, provided different repair options based on our budget, showed up on time, and very professional.  I would highly recommend Nexgen Air!  I will definitely use them in the future for AC and heating needs.<//Text>

The service gentleman that came over our home for regular A/C maintenance Marcus was brilliantly informative and very professional. He gave us great suggestions, options and offered great plans to choose from. We are looking forward to a great relationship with Nexgen. They are absolutely a company to call when you need quick service and professional service.< /review>

George "Guido" was fantastic! He spent a lot of time thoroughly explaining what needed to be done in order to fix the problems I was having. After his diagnosis, he provided me with many photos of his findings and presented me with several options to solve the problems. He was not pushy for a sale, he just helpful me to make an informed decision.

George was on time, very friendly, and extremely knowledgeable. He cleaned as he worked and everything was spotless once he was finished working. He  walked me through each step of the process along the way with photos. When he was finished he went through everything one more time to make ensure that I fully understood the services that he had provided. He also informed me of what I could expect in the future.

I work from home and even while working with the large machines, I was not disrupted from my work. He was very quiet and courteous. He practiced using COVID safety precautions - never taking off his mask, and wearing fresh gloves and shoe covers at all times.

I will definitely be requesting George at NetGen for all of my future HVAC needs!

Thank you!< /Text>

Called on a Friday and they had a technician out by Monday. On Monday the tech was running behind on his job and they called 45 minutes before my appointment to ask if they could push it back an hour, and then the tech called when he was on his way with an ETA. My tech, Brian H, was very professional and friendly. He gave me tips on how to handle my unit and made sure it was running properly before leaving. Over all I’m very satisfied with my experience with both the customer service and in person interactions! Highly recommend. Don’t know about price comparison because if the service is good I’ll pay to have it done instead of shopping around.< /Text>

<Date>1594874371511<//Date><Rating>5</Rating><review>My AC went out completely in my house and I needed new duct work because there was asbestos covering my old ducts. I called Nexgen because 1. I’ve heard their advertisements on the radio and tv a lot and thought they must be doing something right if they can spend all that money on marketing & 2. They have a lot of good reviews online on both Yelp and Google. When I called them, they came out the same day and I was greeted by a sales rep named Zach Negrette. Dude was straight forward and didn’t BS me or try to upsell me at all. He showed me pictures of how the work would look when completed and that is exactly how it looked when it was done. The installers Hugo and Julio did a great job at my house installing everything. They cleaned up after themselves each day they were here and made sure I understood everything that they were doing. I have dogs as well, so they were very patient with me while I put them in different areas so that they could work. I would highly recommend NexGen to anyone needing HVAC work done. Even after the job has been completed Zach has been responsive to my texts and phone calls with the questions that I have had after the install. Sales men (especially car sales men) usually don’t answer or provide good customer service once the sale is done, but this is not true for Zach or anyone from NexGen that I have dealt with so far. If I could give this company 6 stars I would.</review>< Pictures>

I was most impressed by the whole experience with Nexgen.  First, the process for booking an appointment was so easy.  I got a call back and firmed up a time on the same day.  The representative was very professional, courteous, and showed some hustle as he went about his work.  He listened well and presented options thoroughly.  Great service!.< /Text>

Sal came out to assess my broken 16 year old furnace.  He quickly determined the problem and showed me the faulty part.  The price to repair it was excellent as other companies in the area charge $100 more for the same part.  As a result I replaced the upstairs furnace part as well as it was on the verge of going out and also 16 years old.  The new part is a boosted version of the old part so also more efficient. He then explained ways to extend the life of the equipment and how to get better airflow throughout the house. He replaced the filters before he left.  All in all I was very satisfied and rate Nexgen and Sal a 5 out of 5.< /Review>

I got 3 estimates from other companies which included Nexgen.  Tim Eagleson came out to provide me with an estimate to replace both our 17 year old units: one for upstairs and one for downstairs. We live in a 2004 built home in San Bernardino County and had natural gas heating systems like most people do.  So, all other contractors gave me estimates for keeping like for like (natural gas heating and traditional cooling).  Tim Eagleson gave me not only like for like but also a different option that will gain us more energy savings and indoor comfort by doing a VRV system.  None of the other contractors brought this to my attention. There is also a California Clean Air Rebate that is available!

We absolutely love our new system and we are so happy that it's quiet, super comfortable and the air is filtered by a great filter system.  We highly recommend Nexgen and Tim Eagleson for being so helpful and professional throughout this big project.  Also, the installers did a magnificent job! Gus, Ivan, Christian and their helpers are artists at what they do.  Thank you NEXGEN!<//review>

<Review>Very professional, very knowledgeable. Zach's  crew came on time, worked clean and were very patient with us trying to keep dogs out of their way. They were very polite, worked well with each other, and answered all of our questions, and left our home CLEANER than it was when they started!!.

Instead of just pushing a lesser air conditioning system on us to fit our budget, they gave us an awesome, higher quality, very quiet unit at a great price we could afford, with the opportunity to receive a LIFETIME WARRANTY (which I will definitely take advantage of). AND...they moved everything into attic, fixed, cleaned and upgraded our very poorly installed ductwork, replaced all of our attic installation and are coming back to finish the closet our old unit came out of...yeah!! New closet space!
Oh, they did everything in less than 2 days!!!

Next Generation air conditioning looked at us as a small family, not just as another contract. We are retired on a fixed income, so we have been without air for almost 3 years, while we tried to rebuild or credit after my husband became ill in 2015. Next Generation gave us a wonderful system at a cost we could afford on our retirement without nixing our dream of having a trailer to travel with our doggies and see America.

DON'T GO TO ANYONE ELSE..
GO TO....Next Generation air and heating!
Thank you Everyone at Next Generation</Review>< Date>

We were very impressed with Sal Salcedo who came out and gave us the estimate and also was available when we needed him. The guys came out not knowing any additional service we requested and were only told to clean the ducts. We called Sal and he explained the process and even came out to help the guys. They were all very professional and cleaned up afterward. We were told we were getting a hospital filter and got something less. Sal paid himself for another filter and had it delivered. We will definitely refer this company.<//Text>

The Technician called and said he would be there by 9:15 a.m. He was right on time. My appointment was for an Air Conditioner inspection. The Technician, found some minor issues, but he did say, for as old as the system is it is in good shape. The technician was able to get the parts he needed and fixed the issued today. I thought he would have to come back on another day. My Technician was Pedro Ortega. He was very polite and knowledgeable. He went right to work and after he finished he went over the issues and answered any questions I had. I definitely would recommend Nexgen. I saw their commericals on TV. Good company.<//review>

<review>From the moment I called, they understood and appreciated my emergency need regarding my air conditioning not properly cooling. Even though they were heavily booked during a Summer heatwave, I received same day service....on a Sunday!!!! My technician Sal was super friendly, professional and extremely knowledgeable. He was thorough, documenting everything he did and saw, including taking photos of everything with his cellphone. One important footnote. I only wish I had originally purchased my HVAC system from NexGenAir. They have a lifetime warranty on their products!!

Recently purchased a home and called Nexgen to perform an HVAC and plumbing inspection prior to closing escrow. Customer service is excellent and very professional on the phone. We set up a day and time and both technicians called beforehand, arrived early and performed very thorough inspections in a timely manner. I got detailed reports emailed to me and was able to see any issues which put my mind at ease. I’d recommend Nexgen for any work you need on your home!< /review>

<Review>I had gotten an estimate the previous week for a full replacement. That monday the unit went out and I called Zach to see how soon I could get a new one installed.

The technician Gino was very good.  He was very professional, courteous  and a nice person.  My family appreciated he fixed our system .  He has a good personality. It's very important for having someone representing the Nexgen Company like him. Thank you  again<//Review>

<Date>1596252320849<//Date><rate>3<//rate><Text>I think it's way overpriced. My bad for not getting estimates elsewhere. I chose them co'z they have pretty good review but you can pretty much get free estimates elsewhere. Nexgen charges $88 to diagnose & give estimates. They will waive the $88 so long as you use their service. The tech, Joel Chavarri was very good, professional, knowledgeable, and informative.

Bottom line, ask other companies that don't charge just to give estimates. If you think they're expensive, you can ask another company but you won't lose anything.</Text><Pics>None</Pics><response>None<//response>< GmapID>

Excellent service. The workmen did their job well and communicated with me along the way. I would recommend NexGen to anyone wanting to upgrade their system.< /Review>

Sal was very professional.  He even installed a part that was missing which improved the performance of my AC unit. He explained everything and showed me the improvements.  He was even earlier than service window.< /text>

Our technician, Zach, went above and beyond for my family!!!  Excellent communication and did more than what I can ever ask for.  He made sure that my family and I didn’t go another HOT day/night!  He went out to his truck to see what he had in order to fix our unit!  He originally came out here to give us a quote on a new unit.  We will definitely be buying a new unit from them very soon!!  The owner was just as amazing, I made sure to tell him about the excellent service we received from Zach and the owner said to make us comfortable!  Love this company!!!  Thank you for taking care of us!!!< /text>

I called Nexgen and they made an availablity next day for me which I greatly appreciated during the certain state our country is in. When the technician came, He (Paul) was very friendly and helpful. Paul informed me of everything that was wrong with my ac system and devised a plan that could work for my budget. I was genuinely happy with my service.</Text>

Scott Cole, whom we spoke with on the phone, and Andy Mercado (the awesome technician who serviced our A/C unit) were wonderful people to work with! They were very knowledgeable and professional in all of our contacts with them and made us feel like our comfort was the most important thing to them. We will highly recommend them to our family and friends and not hesitate to call on them in the future. . They did a great job!

Nexgen was one of several contractors considered for my 3 TON ac replacement project. The sales advisor was kind and professional. Nexgen was also the lowest priced bidder (even for the better middle tier equipment / warranty packages). They would have won the bid if not for a competitor willing to compete with them on price for this middle tier package. The competitor also offered better special financing offers. (Nexgen's bank also offered 12mo no payments and interest, but afterwards converting to a 120 month loan at 27%---you need to find a better bank Nexgen, they cost you this deal). My only other criticism of Nexgen would be for them to reconsider their bottom tier labor warranty, as 1 year is well below par and going to cost you more business in the long run.<//Text>

<review>Brian Hawkins, our service tech, was the most honest service technician we have EVER encountered. He knew his HVAC; he cleaned out the bottom of the condenser, checked the HVAC in the garage; gave us one recommendation to bring up to code and said our system was holding freeon, was already at the most current requirement and installed our new thermostat that we couldn't be more excited about. We would recommend Brian any day and every day. We were so impressed with his knowledge, polite manner and explained everything to us. We will insist on Brian coming to our home any time we require HVAC service!</review><pics>None<//pics><Response>None</Response>< Gmap_id>

<Review>The technician was great and actually arrived early.  The reason for my rating is the pricing.  My A/C had a coolant leak in it and needed to be fixed and totally recharged.  I was charged $83 a pound for r410a refrigerant which is excessive since their wholesale cost is less than $5.00 (five dollars) a pound. While I realize they need to mark up their services for a profit, I was also charged $247 to fix the leak.  I am posting this as a warning for people who need service.  Their pricing is at least a few hundred dollars higher than it should be.  Again great service, AWFUL pricing.  I don't know if this is their normal pricing, or if they were simply taking advantage of people during a heat wave.  Either way, you probably want to call somebody else.

To the owner who posted a response:  Despite great service from your tech, I have lowered my rating to a 1.  The reason for this is that despite posting that you would contact me AND my filling out your internal review stating I would like to be contacted, you have FAILED to do so.  It seems that you posted a response to simply make it look like management cares what customers think to others who read these reviews.

I am changing this review again.  Management finally got back to me after about a month and made every effort to make me happy.  Again, the technician service was great, I am leaving the rating as a four due to the length of time management took, but I am happy with their service.< /Review><response>{'time': 1564180113828, 'text': 'Hello Scott, Thank you for your review.

I had Nexgen come in and gave me a quote on a new AC and furnace. As soon as I had signed the contract, they went ahead and took out the old units and had them hauled away. The next day they were at my place at 8 am and started working and 4 hours later they were done. I am very happy with their job.They are really good at what they do. I will definitely recommend them.< /Review>

Experience with the technician was great.

Only reason for 4 star is that I never got a call confirming my appointment and they called when in route which caused my wife to have to scramble to be ready.

Overall- will use again.<//Text>

<Text>Started off slow. Was supposed to be here between 8-9 Monday morning. At first i was thinking "OMG, what did i get myself into?". I texted Jeff, who then had Jessica call me. They apologize they had two crews at 1 job, so they sent 1 of the crews over to my place. Got to my house by 11am! The 3 gentlemen showed up, were cool dudes, sociable to anything I asked nice guys, cleaned up their mess, and told me they would return Tuesday morning to finish up. They showed up on time, got the job done, keep me in the loop of things, showed me how everything works. Wouldn't mind having the same crew back if i need anything in the future! Jeff was a cool funny dude. Glad I went with Nexgen. They beat prices I got through Costco, Burgesons, Smart choice, and Sanborn's. Thanks again!<//Text>< Rate>

<Review>Our air conditioner went out yesterday in 90° weather with a 1 year old baby in the house. I called Nexgen as the reviews looked good. Said they could be out in about 2 hours. Received a call stating they could be out sooner which was great. Our technician Roger Cuadra came out and had it going in no time. He also took the time to do a quick inspection and let us know the condition of our ducts in the attic. Not once did he act like a pushy salesperson! Thank you Roger for a great job and your friendliness.</Review><username>Eilee Calva<//username>< gmap_id>

<Rate>5</Rate><text>We had guests arrived to stay with us for a few days and in prepping the guest house we discovered that the AC had gone out. I called Nexgen and they had Andy at our house in less than an hour. He throughly inspected all facets learning then replacing the burned out switch, within 2 hours if contacting Nexgen, and because of Andy's professionalism and extremely nice demeanor we had ice air within 2 hrs.
Andy then helped us with his shop vac to blow up a giant circus ball we had gotten for our guest's little boy, that is more than just good service that is a great community member.
Highly recommend Nexgen, in fact we joined their monthly club as it allows special services year round to keep AC/Heat, plumbing, and water tanks running efficiently all year round.< /text>< pics>

The team at Nexgen made my AC replacement as painless as possible.  They started removing my old system within an hour of signing the contract, and were done by the end of the following day.  Permits, inspection all managed well.  Today it is 90 degrees outside and we are nice and cool inside!<//review>

Zach Negrete was very helpful, knowledgeable and answered all my questions before making a decision. Juan Rodriguez and his team were also very professional and got the job done in a timely manner. I’m rating them a 4 star only because the mess was not cleaned up properly after replacing the air vents. Also one vent was not changed.

Amazing and professional every step of the way. Scheduling was a breeze, no pun intended. I was actually a bit surprised that I was able to get a next day A/C diagnostic appt at a time that fit MY schedule. The phone rep was even cheerful and upbeat.
Axel, our technician, was also awesome. He was super patient with my curious hands-on 7 year old and with my misreading his name which was clearly printed on his ID badge. Oops. He was thorough in checking out every part of the AC system and answered all of the questions we threw at him. Once the diagnosis was complete, Axel explained what he believed to be the issue and how to address it. As a courtesy, he even swapped out the old dirty filter for a fresh one (he said he was worried about my kiddo's health and said it would also improve the air flow slightly).
All that said, I have to give a full 5 star review for my entire experience with Nexgen Air and I would highly recommend calling them for all your heating and ac issues.</Text>

Very professional company with outstanding customer service!  I needed the NEST doorbell installed and I was able to get an appointment within a week.  The gentleman was prompt and courteous as well as the company calling to confirm and notify me that he was in my driveway.  Not many businesses run so efficiently  any longer but Nexgen impressed us incredibly.  It was raining and the installer did bring and use shoe covers entering my home.  The entire job took under an hour and he went through the settings & operation of the devise to ensure we were happy.  I would most definitely call them again!<//review>

After calling four other companies, we settled on Nexgen based on customer feedback and quick response. Called on Wednesday for a servicing appointment for Saturday, service call was smooth and efficient. Our tech Roger was not only kind but extremely professional. Because we had such a positive experience, we went ahead and set up another appointment and will use Nexgen for our servicing and repair needs.  If Nexgen’s tech’s are all like Roger, you won’t go wrong. Thank you.</Review>

My service to my Furnace and Air Conditioning systems, was completed by Jonatan Dimas. Mr. Dimas was very professional, knowledgeable, thorough with his evaluation and explanation regarding the maintenance of my equipment and he was very personable. He is very well trained and polite.

Great company with great rates and prices. They’re financing helped a lot and there $15 a month service plan is 2nd to none. We’re glad we went with Nexgen for our new AC unit.< /text>

I called Nexgen to see about servicing my struggling AC system. The gal who took my call was friendly and accommodating and scheduled a service call for the very next morning.( Something a local competitor could not do.) Zach was dispatched and arrived promptly as scheduled. I had a good idea of what the issue was and Zach quickly came to the same conclusion. No BS, just the facts. System is now running at optimum efficiency. Though he followed his company policy by offering additional services, he did so in a friendly, no pressure, informative manner. I still may take him up on a few. While he worked we chatted a bit, and I discovered that Zach is a Veteran, something I greatly admire. He just continues to serve. Good work son. Semper fi<//Review>

They came just for a water leak diagnosis, and they ended up breaking a shower faucet. Water exploded out; this had never happened before until they touched it. Then they estimated a $2k+ amount for an immediate fix for something they broke. The valve was already old so I understand why, but it was still ridiculous. I went with a temporary fix (that they said wouldn't work, but it did). Fortunately everything went smoothly and the guys were really nice about it and explained everything well.<//Review>

Great team, all of them from zach n. ( great guy)Who sold me on the comfort  system ( not the most expensive central heat&ac system nexgen sells) plus Jorge and the men on his crew the installation Was done in 24 hours, maybe a bit less than that and the installation is beautiful, looks 100% nicer than the old one. Now I’m just waiting for my first electric bill so I can really begin to appreciate the energy savings that come with the newer , more efficient equipment, plus plus by my figuring the system will pay for itself in savings in four to five years an overall good investment no matter how you look at it( plus it’s already got my wife smiling) yay!< /Text>

< Review>
I saw Nexgen’s billboard off of the freeway and the first thing that caught my eye was the Stars and Stripes. Then something unexpected happened. My AC stopped working. Nexgen was the first company that came to mind. I called and was impressed at their level of Customer Service. They wanted to help and were very sincere. Then I saw Axel G. pull up to my house in no time. Axel walked in and diagnosed the problem right away. He was completely transparent with pricing and what work needed to be done. That is very rare in this industry. I knew my home AC was in expert hands. He explained everything in detail and helped me better understand how my AC system works. The price was lower than all of the previous quotes I had received. I thank you and my Family thanks you Sir. He informed me of the X Protection Plan and explained all of the details. I was sold. $14.95 a month to protect my HVAC with tuneups and plumbing? It’s a no brainer. Thanks Axel for your second to none Customer Service and thank you Nexgen for being a Company that cares for its customers.</Review>

Outstanding service and staff! From the moment of contact, each person was friendly, courteous, knowledgeable, professional, and immediately proactive in resolving our hvac issue. Kelly and Liz scheduled us promptly with warm and friendly follow up reminders. Benny was impeccable!! Arrived promptly and was incredibly helpful. He also provided us with helpful advice and tips. Truly a pleasure to work with him. Highly recommend calling #NextGen and requesting Benny Batiz. Superior service, resolution, pricing, and attentive follow through. We’re very impressed.

This company is beyond amazing in service and they truly care.... it starts at the top from the owner.... truly a family with caring heart!  I called for a friend who has a son that  was ill.  Their son is a transplant survivor and went through a biopsy procedure. The procedure went well but he had a terrible reaction and they had to bring him back to the ER. Their AC went out just as their son was reaching nearly 104 temp!  I called and explained the urgency to NexGen and they were able to get their AC up and running in a matter of hours, all for the cost of a service call of less than $100!!  Did I mention this all took place during a severe hot spell on Labor Day Weekend!!  I can’t tell you how impressed I am with NexGen....their honest service is what makes them GREAT.  My friend will likely need a new AC system as their unit is quite old and they will be calling NexGen when that time comes!  This is a prime example of why NexGen is the best.  When you find a company with great service AND one that is honest.... no need to look any further!  NexGen will be my “go to” for all my Air Conditioning, Heating and Plumbing needs forever!  THANK YOU for caring and providing EXCELLENT and HONEST service!<//review>

< Review>
NexGen called me to alert me to the  free service I had coming on the two systems we installed last April, and wanted to make sure I scheduled it before the 1 year period ran out.  I had actually forgotten we had this benefit so I definitely appreciated the follow-up call.  Andy, their Tech, came out (on time) and went over the service with me and asked if I had any questions or would like him to perform anything special on the system.  I DID want to check the balancing and be sure about which units were operating which thermostats.  We had a thermostat, and return ducts and controllable venting installed for each of the 3 bedrooms, in addition to the two new thermostats controlling (1) the master bedroom and 2(2) the family room/ kitchen living area.  All thermostats can be remotely controlled with the Honeywell iPhone app, which is a real plus when returning from a trip and you want to have the house cooled down before you arrive.  Andy checked the entire system's ductwork in the attic and the compressor units outside and mad adjustments that I asked him to on the airflow in the master bedroom and bathroom.  He even gave me a chart the he drew up for me letting me know which thermostats (6) are operating on which of the 2 systems.  Our system required heavy duty filters and Andy doesn't normally carry that size (5" thick) in his truck, so he went to the supply house and picked them up, and came right back and finished up the service call.  Andy covered all of my questions and adjusted the system at no charge on his routine service call.
NexGen, and ALL of their Tech's (like Andy) are extremely professional and knowledgeable; and very well trained on providing exceptional customer service.  I would recommend them to ANYONE looking to repair or update their heating and air conditioning systems.  We spent a considerable amount of money replacing bot systems, plus adding a garage unit, but it has been worth every penny of the investment and the service has been beyond what we expected.< /Review>

After 16 years in our house (home is 25 years old) time to get a quote on replacing our leaking HVAC unit, typed in for a A/C and Heating company in Googled it and the company NexGen was at the top of the list. They quoted a service call quote and would apply that to the replacement price if we decided to purchase it. We asked for a sale technician to give a free estimate for a new unit, a very pleasant phone conversation  led to sending out a salesman for a 9:00am appointment, which he (David) arrived at the scheduled time. We spent time getting to know one another and was very impressed with his years experience and knowledge of the Industry and his competitors. He inspected our unit and explained everything that was to be done. Just as he was going to install it himself, he explained why he recommended out of the 3 different products, Lennox, Trane and Daikin, we chose the Daikin brand, which is the Goodman company out of Texas, Lifetime warranty, Hi-Efficiency, competitively priced, (estimates from last year where higher than his quote for this year, also, after our lengthy questions and answers,  3 hours later, we decided to go with the estimate,  realizing the expense we where going to go thru,  the salesman offered his company to buy the interest down that was better than our credit union with no money down and an affordable monthly payment, with a transferable warranty.
He also said he could have a crew of 4 this afternoon to tear out the old heater and A/C unit and once we decided to go with his company, he made a phone call 1/2 hour later 2 vans from NexGen showed up knocking on our door, talk about service, The crew got started at 12:00 removed and replace the system by 5:00 and the next morning another crew in 2 nice  NexGen  vans arrived at the time they where scheduled. t           This crew did all the equipment hook up electrical and finished rebuilding sheet metal work and insulating the attic, Wifi Thermostat installed. all was completed in 8 hours, cleaned up like no one was there. They all wore booties on there work shoes and covered the floors with canvas.
I give NexGen a 5 star out of 5, personality, professionalism, even the installers are very courteous and enjoy the company they work for. I've been in sales, manufacturing, retail and wholesale over 50 years and retired 1 1/2 years, at 75 its nice to know there is a company like NexGen to service customers the old fashion way, a pleasant voice, a smile and a handshake with your employees saying, thank you for you business.
I wanted to acknowledge all the men that did the work at my house, names where mentioned and wanted to give them recognition for a job well done, all of them where busy from removing the old heater and A/C to the crew that came out and finished the job, a job well done.
From the project manager David (salesman), Gustavo, Omar, Albert, Arturo. This was the second crew that finished up the installation the next  day. The 1st crew where in the area from Palm Springs, did the removal and installation, I don't remember their names, please thank them.</Text>

<Review>Saturday morning veggie and fruit market with good selection of standard, asian, Indian, south east asian veggies. Was able to find some unique items like methi (fenugreek leaves), arbi, karela (bitter gourd), saag (mustard greens), etc. One of the stalls is family run (Lee farms) and will do special orders if you ask them in advance. I was able to get a large batch of full lemongrass plants and leaves. Only one of the stalls is certified organic and has a wide range of vegetables. Fresh egg vendor, a couple stalls that sell small plants and orchids, and one stall that sells local honey. Great spot to get seasonal fresh items. Check it out!</Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None</Resp>< Gmap_id>

<Text>Really nice place to pick up your vegetables and stuff on a Saturday. SATURDAY ONLY! They have everything from fruits to bread to vegetables to organic eggs. Asian vegetables like bok choy and yuchoi here are much nicer than what you will find in asian markets. Come early for the best items! Parking is a bit rough , try to park around Millbrae avenue</Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPKM2akEAFtQCZwy1_xlAna0kpVR0k-U9Jhnngx=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics>< resp>

Easy parking, lots of different veggies and fruits. There's also plants and flowers, focaccia bread and honey! Not as big as san mateo but pretty good for local<//text>

<text>Excellent produce at amazing prices. Less expensive than grocery stores, which pleasantly surprised me. They provide free plastic bags. Sometimes prices are posted, sometimes you have to ask for the price; depends on the vendor. Fruit samples are yummy!< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

Most of the vegitable are certified organic and sold at the reasonable price. You better be there early since some vender carry only limited volume.< /Text>

The no-frills and super affordable farmers market for fresh produce! Not very big but good for regular weekly shopping. Normally 6:30/7 am - 1/1:30 pm on Saturdays!< /review>

<review>Good farmers market with a lot of vendors every weekend. We went earlier this weekend and it was much better than when we go around noon. It's a fun thing to go see and look around on a Saturday morning.< /review></record></dataset><record>

Smaller market with a stall selling focaccia, multiple stalls with produce, a honey stall, an egg stall and a stall selling several varieties of orchids, more than the now common phalaenopsis.  Avoid buying prebagged 10 pound sacks of oranges, despite lower price per pound.  We got stuck with several spoiled ones.<//text>

Good place to pick up local produce at a good price. Unlike a lot of other Bay Area farmers markets, this one doesn't have prepared food or crafts.</review>

< Review>
First time here and they gave away my pizza or lost my order! But eventually  they gave me one that came out the oven to replace it, I guess! Pizza is not that bad, it has a unique taste to it! Saturday night and it was super busy! Parking is a little tight. They have great daily deals that you can't miss out on!< /Review>

The food is great! A little expensive. Really long wait times Everytime. Call ahead if you don't want to wait 30-45 minutes for a pizza. Make sure you don't call the Hanford location<//Review>

I ordered online went in to pick up. First, the young lady working was rude. Second, they forgot to put one of my pizzas in the oven, so I had to wait there an extra ten minutes. Third and last, they messed up on the pizza they forgot to put in the oven and as usual that was the pizza for the picky eaters!! Over all this place is definitely not worth it.<//Review>

Delicious steak and cheese sandwiches. A must stop when traveling through the area. An extra hour on my trip but worth it.< /Text>

<review>Definitely a hit or a miss with this pizza place. If you have the older gentlemen making your food, then it will be phenomenal! However, if you happen to get the young guys preparing your food, then they may be stingy with the toppings and the food will not taste that good. The owners need to realize that the older more experienced employees should be making the food, while the younger less experienced employees work in the back...
Also, the customer service could be a little better and the facility could do with remodeling and cleaning...<//review>< name>

<rating>1</rating><Response>None</Response><text>It's become too much of a hit and miss. I implored some visiting family to try some and was horribly embarrassed. Undercooked all around and considering all the ingredients (boston special i believe) its insulting how undercooked it all was. Only thing salvageable were the pepperonis and crust pinched while deciding next meal.. can be good.. but at 20 something dollars a pop I cannot risk the disappointment. Tried frying it up on the stove.. still gooey and ruined. It is what it is.<//text><Name>Haze<//Name>< Date>

The past couple years, new staff hasn’t been the best but the pizza has always been good. Up until today. Ordered a pizza and it seemed a bit mushy. Wasn’t as hot as it always is and I lifted up the cheese and seen it was still undercooked. Thus the reason for the mushiness. I’m a little disappointed on the direction things have been going with the business. Not trying to be mean, just giving an honest opinion.< /text>< userid>

<Review>Not a good location. I prefer the Hanford location as they are consistent with how they make their food and the service in Hanford is much better. Tonight just a bunch of kids just standing around and talking were working tonight. As someone had pointed out in another review, if there's an older gentleman working the food tastes better as for the younger people working it wasn't good. Tonight I happened to have the younger people. I ordered the steak special and the steak had more tough bits in it this time. I've only been to this location once this being that only visit but in Hanford I never had an issue with the steak at all. Overall I think I will stick to the one in Hanford and I'll pass on this location. If it's a hit or miss like this everytime it's not really worth going back to in my opinion. Having grown up in Hanford, I used to frequent Boston's a lot so I knew what i was getting everytime but this location or the employees working tonight couldn't keep up with what the folks in Hanford are doing. This is my treat I get everytime I come back to visit family and friends but sadly I was disappointed this time around. I don't recommend this location if all of the kids are working. For those who are passing through the valley and may still consider eating here; the popular items from this restaurant are the chicken kabob salads, the steak special sandwich (basically a cheesesteak) and the garlic bread which is a cheese bread made with locally made sandwich bread from Basque; the same as the one used for the steak special. So it's the sandwich bread topped with what the restaurant calls mayo or I call it 'garlic aioli' call it whatever you want, finally topped off with their pizza cheese. It's a very simple garlic bread but it's very tasty. Those are their specialty along with their pizza which all of them are pretty good. They cut their pizzas into squares so that's a pretty unique thing about this place too.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None</Resp>< gmapID>

Tonight's order was not the business. Maybe because the crew working didn't seem to want to be working. Prayer's for you all. My pizzas were undercooked and my sandwich was supposed to have extra mayo and had none. Spent $80.00 and had to find something to make for dinner anyway.<//Review>

<review>Last evening we ordered a pizza and a couple of sandwiches. We were told it would be 30 minutes. An hour later we called and were told it's on the way. Another hour passed by so out of curiosity, I called them again.This time they told me the order is sitting on the counter because the person who took my order didn't write down the address or my phone number. I found that unrealist. They offered to deliver it now, I told them no thanks as I ate my McDonald's burger. Won't be calling you guys anytime soon.< /review>< pics>

I ordered a pizza over the phone to pick up and was told it would take 20 minutes. Gave it 35 minutes and went over there to pick it up and they didn’t even have my order. That’s the third this happens. The food is good but their customer service SUCKS.<//Text>

<date>1539744498947<//date><Rate>2<//Rate><review>The Boston House of Pizza has some problems, but they are problems that can be easily fixed. Upon entering the store front, one can't help but notice the horrible decor. The decor actually proved to be a distraction from the meal. However, the acoustics are good. The place was about half full, but conversation was not drowned out by other patrons.
I ordered a calzone with sausage, meatball, olives, mushrooms, and minced garlic. My friend had a pie with chicken, sausage, and meatballs. The chicken was quite dry and tough to swallow, as was the crust on my calzone. The crust was cooked properly though, and had the right crisp on the bottom. The mushrooms were right out of a can and devoid of any flavor that should have been present with sausage and marinara sauce.
Speaking of sauce, it is basically ketchup with a little dry oregeno sprinkled in. The sausage (where found) was good, had proper fennel flavor.
The calzone was topped with cheese. While this helped the crust go down, it was way too much cheese for the little amount of other flavors. It was served with the flimsiest plastic wear that broke before I could finish the meal.
In general, my impression is that this place used to be a great, a little gem in an otherwise small town in the San Jaoquin Valley. It probably built up a loyal, local following over many years of great service and food. But, they let their standards fall by the wayside, and now can't afford to bring it back up to their former standards. This is evidenced by the missing 'B' on the front marquis sign and the dark arcade games near the bathrooms. It is kind of a shame, actually. Towns like this need a shining place to meet family and friends. I suppose though, to be fair, I will give it 2 stars because it was good enough to take back to the hotel room for tomorrow.< /review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOJmWcw_xLCkLRg_QdPZmM2uBUDc3rnTKT0ufV7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics>< Resp>

Probably the worst customer service ever, went in with my family. My sister ordered and I was up next to order and this tall lady named “Camila” told me rudely “what do you need” like I can’t understand the level of unprofessional she was. After I ordered I was sitting down on my seat she had the nerve to yell at me telling across the restaurant to tell me I had forgot my drink. After we ate we got up to leave asked the cooks her name and obviously they told her that I asked for her name and my sister was still inside at the restroom. As she came out she told me she overheard this loud Camila girl saying she can’t wait to see my yelp review as she’s staring me down through the window. I’ve never had bad service here before until Thursday 7/11/19 and I will never step foot in here again because of her.</Text>

<Rate>1</Rate><review>Sitting in the diner now as we wait for our order to be prepared and it has been well over 30 minutes to prepare.

Several other customers has walked in and placed their orders both for dine in and takeout (I’ve counted at least 20 people) and we are still waiting for our takeout order of only two small items that should’ve taken no more than 15 minutes or less. Every 10-15 minutes we get up and ask, we’re told just 5 more minutes. Honestly, I don’t even think our order was ever put in because there’s no way it should take over 35 minutes ((update!)) to prepare our food.

We keep getting up and circling around and asking and no one has the decency to at least notify us of our wait time.

Service can definitely be improved.

Never returning to this location again, not worth your hard worked for earnings or time. Please be advised and take your money elsewhere. You’re better off at another more efficient and great quality business/service.<//review>< Pictures>

We just moved to the area and was looking for a nice pizza place. We ordered from here once and the food was alright undercooked, little flavor, watered down marinara, and missing a topping one one pie. Being an understanding person i am I wanted to give them another chance. Maybe the first time they were understaffed or really busy. Unfortunately this second time was worse. They were over half an hour late from the time they said they would deliver. They forgot our sides (they did remove from bill), forgot the extra marinara, put the wrong toppings on my calzone. I'm glad people have good experiences, I'm just not one of them so I wont be returning.</Review>

<Text>This is the boston pizza in Lemoore. I had to go to West hills to get my college transcripts. I met a friend and we decided to have lunch. Boston pizza is right by the school.
I go their for the sandwiches not the pizza.
They have the best steak sandwiches in hanford or Lemoore, in my opinion.
Today was no exception the food was Fantastic!! The only thing I would say is that ....
If you are going in for a  quick lunch then it might be better for you to just go through a drive through. This is a sit down restaurant, and a steak sandwich takes about 30 minutes? 35 minutes? I think it's well worth the wait!! Ok that is all</Text></record></dataset><record>

My family used to go there 24 years ago, and we went yesterday and the the flavor in their pizza is the the same. We had the large combination with jalapeños. It brought back memories.<//Text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Text>We've been in Lemoore for 20 years. It was the first pizza place we tried and is still our go to restaurant for pizza and sub sandwiches. I just don't get the other chain pizza parlors in town. There's no comparison to Boston.
As for the service I don't get whoat others have said about their bad experience. Yes sometimes we wait a bit but maybe I'm on small town time. We don't feel the need to be in a hurry. No they are not overly friendly but they are normally busy with no time for small talk. And they have never been rude to me. The interior was remodeled a few years ago and is tastefully done with a cool tin ceiling and stained glass pendant lights over the tables. Oh... and the "area" is not a bad neighborhood!  I feel very safe when I go to pick up food. The parking could be better but it is what it is.
Pizzas are good. Especially the Boston Special. Chef salad is great with little pinwheels of meat and cheese. I love the Steak sandwich  The meat is so tender.
Can't say enough about Boston Pizza. When I tell my daughter and her friends I'm getting a pizza from Boston, their immediate reaction is, "YES!"<//Text>< Pics>

<review>Food is great but the service stinks. My first experience was dreadful.  My order was given to another customer since we had the same name.
I then had to wait another 30 mins for them to remake my order.  Also  when you call and order the person on the other end does not use proper phone edicate.  They are rude and act as if they don't like their job!  Really sad because the food is delightful.  Lastly I have some concerns on how they speak to the older gentlemen Toni.  Especially  In front of customer.  He will ask a question to help address concerns and the abrasively tell him to stay out of it. It's not a big deal they will explain later.  With that said I believe an overhaul of staff or retraining should be done for the ladies that are the front runners of this business.  If you don't have good customer service your business will fall short!</review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

My husband always gets the meatball sub and I prefer the steak and cheese. Add some jalapeños, and it's just perfect. Sometimes the meat is a little gristly, but either wolf it down or pick around those 1-2 pieces. Probably just the nature of the meat. And always allow about 25 minutes for pick up! At least.

A small pizza joint with decent pizza. The meatballs on the pizza are not good. The sauce is so so. The place is a little run down and the wait was a bit long for food. I asked for no onions on my salad and the onions were piled high.< /text>

Fast service, their Steak Special Sandwich with everything and a couple of Jalapeno slices is excellent.  Make sure to have it toasted. If you haven't had one you are missing out.</Text>

It's not just great pizza, they have awesome calzones and delicious subs. Their service is a bit slow but the food more than makes up for it. So if you stop for a quick bite for lunch or dinner your not going to get it here but then again great food doesn't come fast.<//review>

Wow! It's been about 23 years...the food is still great and consistent. As soon as I walked into the restaurant,  it brought me back to memory lane. I worked at the Lemoore store as a young man. Thanks for the great memories and of course the GREAT FOOD! :)< /text>

<review>The wait to receive your food is too long. 30+ minutes at times, which is absurd to receive some pizza. On good terms 20 minutes is the minimum. It’s been 2 occasions where an employee messed up an order of mine over the phone. The second error, the employee was having some temperament issues over the phone which was not the case when the manager was there during the first occasion. Overall, terrible experience with customer service. Food is ok, but it’s not worth the wait nor communicating with discouraging employees doubting that they messed up the order. Whoever hires employees here needs to revaluate their decision making.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

I only ate here once. What I can remember is that the pizza was super thick on the sauce and the dough was way too much. It was more like Chicago pizza than Boston pizza. It was over priced for what I paid. Be warned this restaurant is in a BAD neighborhood so watch your surroundings.< /text>

Compared to the other pizza places in Lemoore I guess it's good. The dough has no taste to it, the cheese fastest like low grade processed to the max cheese, the marinara sauce has no flavor to it, the toppings though good felt like the only part of the pizza that had some flavor, the crust was just crispy with zero taste. This is the least flavorfull pizza I have had. But I guess relative to other pizza spots in Lemoore it's good.< /text>

<text>Terrible terrible terrible. Beware of this business. I called ordered 2 large pizzas, I was told it would take 45 mins 2 and a half hours later still no pizza so I called them back. I asked if I could speak to a manager of course convienently there was no manager around. I asked what happened they said that they didn't have my number even though I gave it to them. So I asked what kind of contingencies they have in place in that situation ( like do they refund my money if I don't receive my pizza) they said they have none. So I asked if they would be making me fresh pizzas instead of the now 3hr old pizzas they said they couldn't even do me that courtesy. I'm absolutely disgusted with the service I have never in my life dealt with such incompatence. Save yourself the castle and go somewhere else.</text>< response>

<review>Should have paid attention to other reviews.  Pizza was bad.  Ordered with white sauce.  I believe they literally spread mayo on the crust and called it a white sauce.  It was really bad. All but a few bits went into the trash.< /review>< pictures>

< review>
Calling in a pizza has always been 15-20 minutes for as many years as I can remember, and their pizza has been consistently good for just as many years. Quick, simple, easy, and I've had great service whenever I picked up my pizza.<//review>

<Text>The pizza there is a little bit more expensive than other places but that's because they use quality ingredients they are a little bit more expensive but it is worth it and if you're not in the mood for pizza they have some of the best Subs & salads you've ever had try the Greek with the feta cheese!!< /Text><GmapID>0x8094bf5d1247daeb:0x40c58fa20048b259</GmapID><user_name>Harold Oversen.<//user_name><pics>None</pics></record></dataset><record>

They got my entire order wrong. Ordered a chicken kabob sandwich they gave me an italian drenched in mayo. Ordered a peperoni mushroom and olive pizza they gave me a peperoni sausage and olive pizza. Not a big deal but when i bit into the pizza i damn near broke my tooth because of the olive pits that they left on my pizza.<//Review>

<review>This is my second time using Storquest and I will never use any other storage company! storquest is top of the line when it comes to cleanliness, customer service and unit prices. Cindy, the manager of the Gardena location gave me a tour of my unit and was very informative and super professional. I was able to get the first month for only a dollar, and I also like how there is no commitments—it’s month to month!
I will continue to use them as a I am now a lifelong customer!!! Thanks again for everything,
you guys rock!< /review></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Cynthia has been amazing to work with! I've been planning a long distance move with lots of last minute changes and throughout the entire process Cynthia has been incredibly helpful and willing to take my many calls. Prior to this, I spent weeks looking for a storage unit online. Storquest stood out to me because of their friendly customer service, transparency on pricing and clear interest in the customer.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

I am giving Cindy 5 stars for her customer service. She was very patient as I am one of those indecisive customers and I also appreciated the fact that she was very knowledgeable with the facility and aspects of the business. Cindy is very courteous and considerate. I think she genuinely takes pleasure in helping her customers which definitely makes your experience all the better.</review>

Today was my first time visiting a storage place. And it was a complete pleasure. Starting with customer service over the phone to the person who greeted us at the door. Coury was great. Super friendly.
Place is new and super clean.
Made me feel safe and secure. I would highly recommend this place.</Review>

The ladies were exceptional. Wendy left no rock unturned. She treated us like she was welcoming us to her home. I plan on doing my visits to my storage when she's working. In these times having someone with that wonderful attitude is a calming experience.

Also, went to rent an additional storage today and Destiny was wonderful. She was so helpful with great suggestions. I spoke to Jose on the phone who assisted me in a way that bought pure comfort.  I love this staff.</Review>

I leased a storage unit from this location for over a year and had a pleasurable experience with the staff and the facility.

When It was time to terminate my lease Destiny was a very helpful and pleasant. The manger Cindy was accommodating to my needs and full of positive energy!

This StorQuest location is a great . Clean and they have a great team.</Review>

The site is impeccably clean, and the staff is courteous and helpful. The building is new, and access is convenient. My one main complaint is the payment system, not about this location itself. Instead of having a payment portal on the website, they send you a payment link via text. If you are late, which I have due to job loss because of the pandemic, you have to go into the office to make a payment. I don't know any businesses that still operate like this, especially when we are trying to reduce in-person contact. I had to make several calls to escalate this issue, then sign and fax a form to get permission to pay over the phone...in 2020. StorQuest really needs to update its payment system.</Text>

Cindy and Mallory were very polite and professional. They were both very informative and answered all my questions and gave nothing but excellent customer service rather than just take my money and get me out the door. They were dry knowledgeable and helpful.< /text>

<Review>Destiny was absolutely great with showing me around the facility and helping me pick out a unit. Destiny went above and beyond to ensure the unit I was interested in suited my needs.  Destiny’s patience with me really impressed me & places her in the category Creme de la creme. Thank you again Destiny!!!!

<GmapID>0x80c2b5884a991f61:0x46f781393e64fc5a</GmapID><review>My mom and I were looking for a convenient air conditioned storage unit and checked out several local options. We ultimately decided to rent from StorQuest in Gardena, CA. Before we visited the location my mom spoke with Couri who was great and answered all of her questions and made an appointment for us. We worked with the manager, Cindy, when we visited the location and once again we received excellent service. I’m glad we decided to rent here and highly recommend StoreQuest.<//review>< Pictures>

Jon was very helpful in helping me find the storage space that I needed.  No pressure at all and very professional.

The location is clean, secure (has cameras everywhere), climate controlled, and covered loading/unloading area.

Note that access is only open from 9am-6pm.< /Text>

Went in on a Saturday afternoon and a nice woman named Katrina helped me look through the different storage options and helped me find what I needed just by explaining what items I was going to store. She was friendly and thorough in explaining the different price points, insurance, rent increases and promotions. She made my visit quick and painless. So glad she was there to help me out!< /text>

<review>It's good to know there's another storage close by. That means I can easily access. It's 9am to 6pm now but will be 6am-6pm once they get they key locks.  The facility is brand new and alot cleaner than public storage nearby, which I have a unit already. will transfer here when i have time.< /review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPbLibpfwKw3BRU4mSDUBUL2v8YvoKDR71vm24y=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics>< resp>

I went to StorQuest self storage in Gardena because this particular location is climate controlled and new.

I was helped by Chris N. who patiently showed me various units on two different floors. Both Chris and his colleague, Pati were courteous, helpful and pleasant during my sign-up process.

The facility is clean, well kept, secure and I saw that the ceilings were amply covered in fire retardant material.

I looked into several storage businesses and decided on this one because of quality, pricing and location.

Note: When signing up for storage rental, if you have renter’s or home owner’s insurance, be sure to bring a copy, otherwise you’ll need to purchase their insurance ($12 a month and up).</text>

This is a very clean place. The restrooms can be a lot cleaner at times it seems like the staff isn't cleaning the restrooms. also if you need to throw anything in the trash they have no garbage bin to throw any necessities in. The staff is very polite and are willing to help you. The pricing is very reasonable as well based on promotions.<//text>

<rating>4< /rating><Text>So glad we found this place.

It's further away than our Previous Storage facility we had, but now so much more affordable as well as climate controlled.

Place is new, and the staff is great!.

Fingers crossed it stays this way for years to come.<//Text>< Pictures>

Update: 9/25/20 yes I’m still here 2 years later! Downsized 3 times however and today finally graduated to the small tiniest space now! Destiny really helped me out today, she is great 👍🏼 I just have the most important things pics and memories stored now! Still wonderful customer service after all this time.

2 years ago:Jeremy and Christian were both awesome.  The service here is great. The climate control units are a plus and good pricing.< /review>

Chris was a great manager. He assisted me over the phone and in person handling my bill payment and storage concerns. He is personable and warm. I am so glad that I decided to rent a locker storage at this location!</review>

Cristian and Jeremy had been helping me for several weeks with all my moving needs. In addition, they have put boxes together for me and assist with all my questions and moving needs as I've been preparing for weeks out. Thank you Jeremy and Cristian for going above and beyond. You guys have been super patience and amazing each and every time.
Thank you for your diligence and support through out everything.</Review>

< Review>
I was disappointed initially because I had reserved a storage unit before I went down there to move my stuff in but when I arrived & was taken to the unit that was supposed to be reserved for me, THERE WAS A LOCK ON IT & IT WAS ALREADY IN USE. I then was lead all around, by the attendant on site, the the 3rd & 4th floors for like 30 minutes in an attempt to locate an available storage unit. When I finally received a unit after about 45 minutes, I was told that I would not be charged for a CYLINDER LOCK that was needed to lock up my unit to make up for the inconvenience and for slowing down my moving in my belongings, but this was not the case. EVEN THOUGH I CALLED & RESERVED A UNIT I HAD TO LITERALLY WALK AROUND THE FACILITY FOR 45 MINUTES WITH A CLUELESS ATTENDANT WHO KEPT GETTING LOST & THEN WHEN I DID FINALLY FOUND AN AVAILABLE STORAGE UNIT I WAS LIED TO ABOUT NOT BEING CHARGED FOR A CYLINDER LOCK & THIS IS HOW I WAS TREATED AS A BRAND NEW CUSTOMER AT THIS ESTABLISHMENT! The Manager made no attempt to rectify the situation nor did he issue an apology for the INFERIOR service. & ALSO THE WAY THEY HAVE THEIR LOADING & UNLOADING DOCK IS STUPID & NOT CONDUCIVE TO BEING AN EASY TO MOVE THINGS INTO & IT'S VERY STUPIDLY DESIGNED!< /Review>

I ABSOLUTELY recommend Storquest GARDENA Location. It’s all new, ALWAYS CLEAN 🧼 and importantly 5 Stars STELLAR AWARD winning CUSTOMER SERVICE. This location is “SECOND to NONE”. Everyone is so Pleasant with a smile 😃

Screaming “THANK YOU” to “CHRISTIAN” !
My experience working directly with CHRISTIAN has been AMAZING! He has gone above and beyond nothing LESS! What an ASSET to this company! 😀😀😀😀😀😀😀

If you want an immaculate storage company you can trust to store your most precious belongings. Look no further this is the place for you!<//Text>

This is a very clean facility, climate controlled as well. The staff are great and very friendly I would recommend to anyone who needs to store your extra stuff. I had a big crew and everything went great working around the other customers because there elevators are huge and fit everything we brought in .  Thank you to the manager cristian. Got me the units I needed for the job I was working on while in Gardena ,ca he is a great person And does a great job helping out the customer....thank you again for the great storing experience at your Gardena location ....</Text>

<Text>Reserved unit 4215 was not available because the facility keeps there building material. The manager did not honor the reserved price since the only other unit was larger. Since I arrived with workers and a loaded 20' truck had no other choice but take the larger unit and pay extra.<//Text>< pictures>

Buyer beware. This building is often left unattended and it's difficult to get in-touch with staff for assistance or questions. The loading area is always trashy and putrid smelling. Also, be prepared for a severe price increase of 15%-20% on your monthly payments after a few months.<//Review>

We were at the location in Gardena and had the pleasure of working with Raeann. She was absolutely amazing!! She was the only one working that day and it got a little busy. She was able to handle everyone professional and with a smile!! Although the place closed at 6pm we weren’t quite finished moving our things in, she never rushed us, and when we came to her at around 6:30 and apologized she just smiled and said “it’s ok”. To make matters worse, not only did my sister lock herself in the parking area, and she had to come get her, but after she locked the doors my sister realized that she had forgotten her phone upstairs near the unit, and Raeann with a smile said no problem, and walked her back upstairs to get her phone!!!  Just a perfect example of great customer service!!! Thanks again Raeann, YOU ROCK!!!👋🏽👋🏽😃😃<//Text>

I originally had an appointment on Jan 20th. I stopped in the store and asked if I can do all of the computer work the day before. Chris and the other young lady (I forgot her name please forgive me) was very pleasant, funny and  welcoming. And the couch is not just cute but soooooooo comfy. I recommend this facility<//review>

< Review>
The office people are friendly and helpful.The storage facility is clean and has loading from indoors which protects the renters from bad weather.
Security cameras are every where.This company offers real value as compared to a Public Storage facility. there units were about 20% less expensive than a public storage uunit just up the street. We has a bad experience with the last Public Storage unit my wife and I rented. It was broken into and our things were stolen.In addition, it seemed that homeless people were living at the Public Storage facility and we never felt safe going to our unit. The Storquest facility feels safe.

Every time I go there the staff I see the staff treating people like their in prison. If I try to enter into an already open door the guard stands there blocking the entrance telling me to input my access code. I’ve been a customer for years and year by year it gets worse. There are no trash cans and they call your phone and make threats to charge you for the clean up. There was 2 restrooms 1 on the first floor and one on the second floor but for some odd reason (prior to covid) they shut the 2nd floor restroom down. So if I am clearing some things out of my storage, I have to go all the way downstairs and hope there isn’t someone already in there. Which is usually the case. They got some rude employees</Text>

This storage facility is a plus for the residents & the city of Gardena, it's clean, there are security cameras throughout the facility and as a customer, my security concerns was addressed by their staff Liz, she's professional, friendly, not to mention she is so nice to customers, the male staff is also kind, I highly recommend this storage facility.<//review>
