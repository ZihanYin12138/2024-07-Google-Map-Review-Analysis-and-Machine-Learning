Pre pandemic I used to go there all the time. This time I went it was disgusting. Food all over the counter. Puddles of sauce everywhere. I stood in line waiting my turn for about 30 minutes not once did anybody attempt 2 clean the mess.< /Review>

<Text>I love coming to any Mongolian bbq place! The food is always so delicious and since you create it you really can't go wrong! There was a bit of a wait and honestly I think they need a bigger location as they are pretty busy! The staff are very friendly and attentive!

I always enjoy the opportunity to have some GK Mongolian BBQ bowl. I have ate at most of them in the valley from Stockton to Manteca to Tracy. This one unfortunately lacks leadership. I know it opened not long before Covid but the customer service is just not there yet. This past visit one of the guys left the grill to stand at the end of the counter and talk for about 20 minutes to a girl he knew. It left one guy on the grill and slowed down the whole process. The time before that we could not get a drink refill to save our lives. When I Grubhub it in a few weeks ago it tasted like that added Lobster sauce which I hate and I was not able to eat it. This location needs some TLC to get up to par with the rest of the GK's.< /review>

It was my first time going to this place & I must say it was a delight! I was a bit caught off guard w/ preparing my own bowl at first but you have the option of them doing it for you also. Overall my experience at this spot was great & hope to be back soon :)< /text>

Very disappointed in service from this restaurant today. I ordered through door dash and they dropped my food off on time. The order had everything that I ordered except the ingredients of my two dinners were completely wrong. I would've eaten it if it was good but it wasn't.  When I made my complaint to door dash, I received a $6.60 credit to my door dash account. 2 dinners alone is a little more than $20-.  I called the restaurant and they are adamant that door dash made the mistake. He kept saying that they must have grabbed the wrong bag. My name is Jim. The name on the bag is Jim. The gentleman I spoke with also accused my of lying about getting only a $6- credit. I paid $50- and was able to eat the potstickers. Guess ill just have to go to the Modesto restaurant from now on.< /Text>

Mongonlian BBQ is a very quite place just to eat some Chinese food. It's big enough to eat with family or friends. I like this place a lot because you can serve yourself as much as you want in your bowl without a limit, just for a small price! I recommend to those who are their first time coming here to eat!</Review>

Been going here for 3+ years. After new management took over, it's been much cleaner and more organized. The staff is friendly, and the food is so good! Use minimum 8 scoops sauces and 3 scoops oils. And always garlic powder :)</Text>

I would give this place 5 stars but last experience almost makes me want to not go back. Ive been to this spot several times and this was unacceptable. The cook who made my food was extremely rude. After handing him my bowl which I agree is bigger than most, he immediately threw half in the trash stating I'm not cooking that, while cooking he purposely knocked food on the floor even grabbing noodles and throwing them on the floor.80 percent of my dish was ruined. I was never asked for extra sauce, or garlic powder. I emailed the chain and have not gotten any response to the incident.

Updated. I decided to return and found out that person was fired  turns out I was not the only one with this experience from the same employee. . Management was very
Apologetic and happy to see a returning costumer. It's now my favorite spot again.  Five stars and more if I could. Great job staying clean during these Corona times.</text>

Came in a few weeks ago during the weekend, just came in the other day, and I gotta say, it gets better and better every time. good food,  better service. Ive been in the restaraunt business a long time and I really take pride in good customer service. I can remember when It was really busy, but the cook and waiter were fantastic, along with the rest of the crew. Kudos to Aaron, Andrew, and the rest of the team back there, keep it up</review>

Today was Mine and My family first time at GK Mongolian BBQ. Right off the back Danielle had great customer service and was very descriptive on how dinner works(all you can eat, first bowl you can take home if you don't finish, childrens bowl are $3.20 age 4). I'll end by saying my family and I will be coming back for lunch or dinner in the near future!<//text>

<Review>The food was not that great.  The cook dropped slot of the vegetables that I selected while cooking.  The place was unclean.  The floors were dirty.  They did not have any carbonation in the soda fountain and none of the staff was friendly.   It's a shame because this used to be a great place.<//Review>< Pictures>

They really need to consider getting cup carriers. Everytime I go, I usually buy more than one bowl to take out and I have to struggle with their drinks because they do not provide cup carriers. The cashier lady in charge has always been nice enough to cut a box open to help accommodate my drinks to go. Owner should really consider cup carriers. They're not expensive. Steal them from McDonald's or something.< /text>

<Text>Love it! You decide what goes in the bowl and you select flavors for seasoning and how hot or mild or bland as you want. Staff was very friendly and helpful with suggestions.  We opted for a healthier route by not using any oil and they were very accommodating. Space is upscale casual. Definitely a nice addition to Turlock's restaurant scene. Vegan/Vegetarian friendly.<//Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNvXCYQinO6xc9xsMPKUuFxOqKQtvzOaOhFEWb9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures><resp>None< /resp>< gmapID>

Good food. Something I did not know you can pay extra and get shrimp. If your going for your first time do not mix the meats also. The food in your bowl will shrink once cooked so you might want to put a little more in your bowl.<//Text>

Elegant, upscale restaurant, with very nice ambiance and a great staff. Mayra was very attentive, and very helpful for a family of first time visitors. The restaurant is very nicely decorated and fits the motif well. Lunch was very flavorful and satisfying. Areas needing improvement and recommendations: Remodel the restrooms, the restaurant is too beautiful for the state of repair of the restroom. I would change the music to play actual Mongolian music. The country music throws off the effect of in a Mongolian grill.< /Text>

Omgoodness how my family loves driving to Turlock to eat at this restaurant!!! We found GK Mongolian BBQ in Stockton about 30 years ago and have been eating this tasty fare ever since. Just very glad that they branched out to Modesto, then Turlock!! I hope that Merced is a part of their expansion plan. This place cannot be beat or replaced by another Mongolian fare. And the owners, and every staff we have ever been served by in all the 30 years of visiting GK restaurants, have been kind, personable, and professional! Do yourself a favor and go treat yourself to a GK meal soon. You can thank me later!< /text>

My favorite cook is never there anymore.. its good still, never a complaint about the food. Don’t go in the mornings or else you’ll be put in a booth by one of the workers kids. It’s a restaraunt, not a funhouse.<//review>

For anyone that's been to any  Other GK locations they know that they're in for a treat when they go.  This is A large location with plenty of seating for the whole family.  It's a great deal especially for all you can eat dinner.  I like that I can put in lots of vegetables and it's probably in one of the healthier buffets is in that regard.<//text>

. Frequent 2-3 times per month. Food is delicious without question. However, the last 2 times this past month, Soup was cold- requested replacement.Last week the soup & rice bowl were only 1/2 full. Only 1 server on Sat. night- need more help for better service.< /text>

<Review>One of my new favorite places. All you can eat. You make the bowl yourself and someone else cooks it. If you don't like it, there is no one to blame but yourself ha.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

I love Mongolian BBQ and I am so happy to have GK in Turlock. The staff is always friendly and the food is delish. Anyone who complains the food isn't great has nobody to blame but themselves since you make your own bowl. Kinda random but the carpet could stand to be replaced and the floor gets sticky but that's because people drop food when building their bowls, step in it, and then track it everywhere.< /Text>

This place is absolutely family friendly, I like to bring my kids after Brazilian Juijitsu on the other side of town, they love it. The staff always brings the best customer satisfaction, and the manager is always making us smile. Great tasting food, amazing environment, and always clean. Thank you guys, for always making our experience amazing.

Good food, but a bit pricey. They really need to have more staff in the evening though. I went in with a party of 5 during a busy time and it appeared there were only 2 servers so we were left waiting for the occasional service for long periods of time despite asking or waving our server down for questions.< /Review>

<text>This place is full of good memories and good food. It is like the subway of meat noodle dishes! Great for dine in or takeout. Grav a bowl, pick your foods, and hand it to the nice chefs who will grill it while you watch and probably drool slightly over the smell as you wait. Food is always amazing and they have a wide variety of fillings and sauces to choose from. If you can dine in, prepare to be treated to a playlist that is like a living meme, as the sounds of All Star, Psy, and other forgotten musical legends anoint your eardrums.< /text>< user>

<Review>Finally, something different in Turlock!! Been going to Mongolian BBQ in San Jose since 2000... Awesome that we have one here now.  The soup was absolutely delicious- I got a couple pints to go.  Excellent ingredients everything is fresh as it should be!

Only comment I would make about improvements would be the addition of other more exotic meats like lamb or goat and maybe a sign or two with formulas for the sauces.

Otherwise glad that you guys finally you're here thank you keep up the good work!!<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

Love to create my own bowls! I've been to the Modesto and Turlock sites. I've had the dinner here in Turlock and both times it's been phenomenal. Lots of good food for a fair price. When they ask you if you want garlic powder, always say yes :)<//Review>

Food all over the counter & floor. With 1 or 2 customers, this area should be clean! I tried to use the restroom. 2 stalls, 1 had no toilet paper & 1 had a broken lock. Very disappointed!! If the cleanliness doesn't improve, I won't return.< /text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

Don't waste your money! This location is awful. The food is bad and the staff clearly do not want to be there. The containers of food were empty and they were not being refilled. Don't look up at the ceiling because you will loose your appetite quickly. It is dirty and the vents are covered in filth. Very disappointed.<//review>

couple weeks ago, my kids wanted to go see the avengers premiere and my son wanted to go to Mongolian bbq before the movie. waitresses were below average. either they bother us too much or dont check on us enough. the old cooks were great, but the new cooks are so, so. your experience depends on the cook. and the cook acted like he couldnt hear me when i asked for hot sauce on my bowl, and when i went up for second one,  i waited a few minutes before he finally noticed me.</text>

I was in around 330pm and starving. Nobody else in the place.  Two guys inside and two outside and no one cleaning.  I tried to eat half of my bowl and then left because it wasn't even tasty.

Super pretty trail with a nice view both up and down. It's an out and back so you can make it as short as you want. There are a lot of spots to stop and rest along the way and just take in the beautiful view.

It's a pretty easy hike. There's a steady incline on the way up and going down is quick and easy.

There's a free parking lot right at the head of the trail and some street parking if the lot is full. I came on a Saturday afternoon and there were still several spots when I arrived and the lot was almost empty when I left.<//text>

I came on a Tuesday afternoon around 5:45PM, not many cars in the parking lot. The trail was fine, no shade and goes steadily uphill for a while with decent views. I came across a snake on the way up and waited for it to get out of the way. Came across a few people but not crowded by any means.</text>

Little steep it might hard for beginners, but very good leg workout. At end of 2 trees trail there are so many trails , it also connect to M and C trails.its a short and sweet trail. Give it a try. #Noshade #steep< /Text>

<text>Nice short, steep hike. There was more green than I would have thought (though still not much in August) and even a creek with running water and a bit of an oasis a third of the way up the hill. Would recommend it.< /text><username>Warren S</username>< Rating>

<text>Great trail with great views! Relatively easy hike with some steeper parts here and there but it was fun. Trail goes on for quite a bit but you can turn back anytime. Parking is limited at the entrance to the trail but you could probably park around the neighborhood. Would definitely  recommend and go back again.</text>< Pictures>

Oh and watch out for incompetent people who think that it’s the LAW to have to cover your face while hiking when it’s not the LAW. It’s a recommendation. Keep your six feet and Be respectful of others space and all should go well.

Quite the leg workout going up but the views are more than worth it. Tons of wildflowers were starting to bloom up the mountain and it felt like you were in a much different place than Riverside. When you get to the road up top keep going to reach the March 'M'< /text>

DON'T PARK AT THE TRAILHEAD (during the pandemic, and maybe even otherwise). Numerous cars have been getting broken into with smashed windows. Just park elsewhere in the neighborhood. It's a beautiful trail btw. Hawks, Granite Spiny lizards, Encelia farinosa, classic Riverside stuff.</Review>

That being said, don't expect anything like Yosemite national park or big sur, but relatively it would earn this five star rating most of the 365 days in a year<//Text></record>

<text>Gem of a hike that's perfect for a quick activity. In the Summer is gets very hot, but absolutely beautiful when it's cooler. I love to bring visitors up here for sunset, the sight of the city lights stretching out below you with the sunset is perfection. If you're lucky, there's a stream in the Spring and sometimes you can even see wild Burros wandering around.< /text>< pictures>

If you want a hike, this is it with beautiful views of the city. Take a good pair of hiking boots and your friendly four legged family as they too will enjoy running thru the brush. I encountered coyote, rabbits, donkeys and owls.<//Review>

<review>Hidden little gem of a hiking trail. Super easy free parking in a dirt lot right off the end of the pavement. Only about 10 spots but I've never seen more than than 4 taken at any one time. Trail starts 50 yards from the lot. Park closes at dusk.</review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

Its a perfect place to eat but It gets full very quickly so come early. You a can not bring food or drinks inside. their is a lot of tables  and chairs and tv's and so many  food options. And if you go there enjoy your food.</Text>

<review>(Translated by Google) I liked the food, and the cleanliness, the only thing that outrages me is that people do not understand the Pandemic and it showed us that it is not a game, so why not keep social distancing and continue to wear face masks.

<text>Marvelous pasta restaurant! From their front desk, Art accommodated my inquiries right away. It was a nice experience for me for the first time. The quality of service they provided was amazing compared to other restaurants. I will definitely be giving my entire Five stars all the way for them. Awe-inspiring and breathtaking service!< /text><response>None<//response>< gmap_id>

<Text>Wings are juicy. Sauce is good. Takes about 5 min to get your pizza. Price is fair. Crust is thicker than places like Blaze Pizza or Mod Pizza. It's a pretty big size portion for their "Publish Your Own Pizza". Comparable to like a large Mod Pizza. Lines are very short. Soda is $2.50. Personal chicken wings ($7) we're 6 pieces. Pretty tasty. All the workers are friendly and nice. Feels like a family run store.<//Text><Response>None</Response>< name>

Came here on my honeymoon with my wife for a quick yet filling bite to eat. We we’re greeted by a courteous staff who helped accommodate my wife’s dietary needs. We each built our own  pizzas which were delicious. The pizzas were on the pricey end but we made two meals out of them so I’d say it’s worth it. Overall the place looked pretty sanitary and was accommodating for dine in.<//Text>

Very soft doughy crust. Fresh tasty ingredients. Not as many toppings as similar build your own pizzas. Greater variety of tap beer. Bathroom wall decorated with newspaper  ads from the 40's. Friendly staff. Place opened 8/24. Still have new look. Uses small pizza wooden pizza flipper to serve. Ample parking.<//review>< pictures>

<Review>Looks like a great place. Looki forward to dining in here one day. In the meantime, pizza is great. Do try making your own. Lot of taste.

Only negative was that the restrooms were closed. I have seen some places keeping restrooms open and some keeping it closed during these days. I think that restrooms should be kept open, allowing customers to freshen up, wash their hands and remain clean.<//Review>< name>

They also have their menu should you not wish to build your own pizza. Your pizza would be ready with 10mins. I hope they can open a few stores in my are.

It's a fun idea and the staff kids are efficient, but the pizza sauce is sweet and one of the least favorite salads I've had for the price. Presentation in clear plastic to go container was also not good for the price. Clean, adequate, but with so many delicious places to eat in a high concentration, you'll have to work harder to get a repeat visit. Hope it doesn't go the way of the printing press.< /Text>

The pizza was good, the root beer float was awesome and the garlic cheesy bread sticks were so so satisfying. In addition, it was a very fun experience and the staff was super friendly and engaging, despite us being there pretty late in the evening. I noticed they also had beer, and the bone e is cool, so I think this would be a great place to hang out with friends.</Review>

This place.just open up at Eastridge Mall.  The small pizzas (11 inch)  are about $10.  I got The Tribute for $10.50.  Their craft beers are pretty good.  I got Lost Coast tangerine Wheat for $6.50.  Tastefully decorated and a good place for casual dates.  You can catch a movie at the AMC  theatres after the pizza.</Text>

I loved the service. The place gave a welcoming vibe. The owner(I presume) came to our table and thank us for coming to the restaurant. Is this a restaurant chain?< /text>

Don't get the kid's pizza, you're better off getting a regular. The kid's order is literally half of a regular, plus juice and a cookie. (We generally don't care for the juice/cookie) Now that we know what to order we will keep coming back!<//review>

< Review>
I took my lil basset hound in to get spayed. They were extremely friendly and did an amazing job, a couple months later and there is hardly even a scar.

They sent her home with clipped nails and the vet called a couple days after to make sure that she was doing well. After a week I took her in because she had a bit of swelling and they looked it over without any hassle. The swelling was not an issue.

Overall it was the best experience I could have hoped for, especially for someone who was as worried about sending his pup in for surgery as I was.</Review>

Sad circumstances, but, when we called for emergency services and told them we were on our way last night, there was no hesitation. They were at the facility when we got there with our dying wolf-boy. Thank you Myrtle Ave Vet for your professionalism and the sensitivity you showed for our Faelan and our grieving kids.</text>

Myrtle ave clinic was the on call office for emergencies and my dog ended up having to have surgery. They were so incredibly kind, professional, and quick to act. An other vet even came and assisted. The next morning when I was concerned the staff answered all my questions and made me feel comfortable and again just so incredibly kind.<//review>

<review>I love my little dog, Jojo, more than I can ever explain. That’s why Dr. Richardson of Myrtletown Vet Hospital is the only vet I completely trust to treat him. Here’s why..... I took Jojo in on an emergency and found out he had chronic pancreatitis. Things didn’t look good and my husband and I were scared. Scared because we were afraid that this vet doesn’t know us and how much Jojo means to us. We were sitting in our truck quietly crying when Dr. Richardson came out and said “I know Jojo is your little man and I can see how much you love him. So I want you to know that I will do everything I can to save him for you. I will love him and treat him like he is my own”.  I knew that moment that he would fight for Jojo. Not only did he save our little love but he quoted us a price and didn’t charge one cent over that even the Jojo was in the hospital 2days longer than expected. I can never say thank you enough. The entire staff is exceptional. From the minute I check in until I check out everything runs smooth. I never have to wait because the schedulers are good at their jobs. If I have questions (which i do)they never make me feel like I’m a bother.  Dr. Richardson always always calls me back the same day.  I’ve never walked out of that office feeling like I just got screwed for unnecessary services  like I have with other vets. I would and do highly suggest Myrtletown Vet Hospital.  I’ve heard nothing but good stories about the other Vet’s that work there</review><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None< /Response><GmapID>0x54d3ffb3da2ad371:0xd36a2de8716eb82c</GmapID></record>

I've only been once, but the vet techs I was able to see were great and made it so my puppy was calm and collective for her second round of shots. I have an appointment for an actual vet visit coming up in September, and I look forward to hopefully boosting this up to 5 stars.<//text>

<Review>We had to go in after hours for an emergency. Staff was friendly and efficient. I appreciated the way they approached treatment of a beloved pet and cost. I know people can have that anxiety, and their customer service skills in that regard were exceptional. On top of that they were obviously busy and in the middle of a surgery when we first called and when we got there. They didn't let that show, and appeared to prioritize their patients appropriately. We truly appreciated them.< /Review>< Resp>

I would've given 5 stars, but the staff didn't get my pups vaccine right and then never gave me his flea medication that I paid for. Over all, the staff was apologetic and professional. I did have to buy his flea medication twice for a single dose.< /Text>

This place is amazing. Honestly, one of the best vet clinics I've been to. Dr. Richardson helped me save my cat from a diabetic crisis and kindly kept my limited budget in mind the whole time. I have not met many doctors like him that is so willing to go above and beyond to help a pet. Also, they're vaccine clinics are awesome just be prepared to wait a little. Do yourself a favor and take your pets here.</Text>

< Review>
Terrible, terrible experience with Dr. Ninekirk. I took my cat in because of concerns, about why she was not eating. I was told by Ninekirk, that Grace was "hissy", and would need to be sedated for an examine.  I was not told of any risks. I agreed. Grace suffered a stroke, that caused neurological damage, as well as blindness, and ultimately her death. I contacted Myrtle Avenue Veterinary Hospital, about my disbelief on how Grace's care was mishandled. They have chosen to ignore me.</Review>
<Pics>None<//Pics><Response>{'time': 1595361143635, 'text': "Losing a beloved pet is always hard;  however, sedation of an aggressive cat is sometimes necessary in order to obtain further diagnostics.  Cat's can be very good at hiding any sickness until it has become too late for treatment.  Unfortunately,  this was the case with Grace. You  had reached out to management after normal business hours, which was relayed to Dr.Robinson the next business day. There has been open communication with you up until this point,. Including the two times Dr. Robinson has tried to call  you (she even  called you on her day off).  Your concerns of provided care have been addressed with all staff members who you have expressed concern with.   We are truly sorry that you have lost your beloved Grace, and that you are emotionally upset; however, your accusations are not accurate, nor are they fair to place all blame on our facility.  We wish you many days of healing with Grace now that her ashes have been returned to you.\n\nSincerely,\n\nMAVH Staff"}< /Response>< gmapID>

<Review>I spoke with Melissa this morning; their desk clerk, who refuses to answer the phone for the first hour they opened today. I even sat outside and WATCHED her ignore the calls. My dog is injured from an attack from a vicsous pitbull two days ago and not even the Humboldt County Emergency line can offer any help. Not even a cleaning of the wounds. When I spoke to Melissa this morning I was welcomed with an absolute rude tone and no effort to help my situation. This is supposed to be my regular vet but since "the corona virus" pandemic nothing seems to work correctly anymore. I called fortuna vet and they were equally as horrible and ingenuine. All I wanted was my dog to be seen but instead I get, "try your luck every morning at 8 we don't have appointments until next month" This is BS!

*Edit* ~ *Reply to Owner's Response*
You have the wrong person in mind you must be having problems with multiple customers. So this is a complete lie. You weren't willing to see me at 11:30 and I haven't returned since. Also, your reply is just plain heartless. If you really wanted me to delete my comment you would have called me back and cleared things up with me directly. This is my baby I don't have time to be seen a month out, my request was simple and urgent!< /Review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

LOVE this vet hospital!! Brought my dog in for a severe skin issue and the staff was able to work me into their schedule to see us- I appreciated their concern, fast response and ability to adjust their schedule. The vet was caring,  very knowledgeable and professional.
My dogs skin cleared up right away and was so grateful to the vet’s diagnosis and successful treatment.< /review>

Myrtle Ave Vets are the only place I take my fur babies. They are caring and professional while working with my cats and also in explaining all the details to me. I have had to go there for 3 of my fur children who needed help for end of life over the years. The vets there were so kind and gentle with not only our furry children but with us. They are worth the drive if you need veterinary assistance. They offer Saturday shot clinics. So convenient!  Also there is a pretty well stocked pet store next to it.</review>

<review>Took my cat in for an appointment today which I made three or four weeks ago.  I did not realize that they required payment at the time of the appointment until I saw a sign in their office saying as much, so I told them I would not be able to pay for a couple of days.  I did not anticipate being completely broke from having to pay for car repairs when I first made the appointment a month ago.

Despite having been a paying customer in good standing with them for years, they forced me to reschedule to come back in another 3 weeks.  Evidently it is okay with them to let my cat suffer for 3 more weeks in an attempt to avoid taking a tiny risk of not getting $65.  They won't even be able to schedule someone else for my original appointment time, as I was already in the office, so what is their motivation here?

If I had known how callous they would be, I would have kept my mouth shut and dealt with the consequences after the appointment for the sake of my cat.  But instead they will now punish my cat for my honesty.  How classy and compassionate.

Called around and found a vet that is taking new clients, didn't make me schedule an appointment a month in advance, and charges less for a standard visit.  I will not be giving my business to Myrtle Avenue Veterinary Hospital again unless I absolutely have to.< /review>< Pictures>

Friendly and caring staff and doctors. Dr. Robinson was extremely supportive when our 5 year old lab was diagnosed with cancer. We decided to try chemo treatment and Dr Robinson took a personal role in helping us. Unfortunately we had to say goodbye to Bella and Dr Robinson came to our house to euthanize her. She was very caring and supportive during this difficult time.

Dr Richardson is another superb doctor... He is genuinely caring and even calls after hours... He is currently assisting us with our 5 month old kitten that is experiencing severe seizures. We wouldn't take our furry family members any place else.< /review>

<review>Super disappointed. I took my dog here cause he was super sick acting. After they looked at him, I received a quote for $2400.00, to maybe fix the issue but that it looked like gas. I asked to pick him up and that he be given antibiotics, as I did not have that kind of money. I told them that I would rather wait to see how he was feeling the following day and was going to take my dog home. A second vet asked to speak with me to clarify a few things before I took him. she informed that she thinks it may be something majorly wrong and not just gas. She convinced me to let him stay for further review and he should stay the night and that she would call in the AM.  I was quoted that the highest amount would be $1600.00 and that I could do payments. I told her that I wanted to save cost anyway possible as I have a family of 5 and was the only income. Long story short, it costed me  $1,800.00 for gas. They also told me he would have a small incision it was not (the incision was the length of his stomach) they did not relay any information to front staff of the payment plan. The front staff lady told me it was (and I quote) $17.75 as she handed me a handful of dog food, which I thought was just for the dog food. When my dog came out, I was waiting for someone to pull me aside to figure out the cost/payment plan. When I asked the tech what about payment, she said I had already taken care of it.  I pulled out my receipt and seen that they ran my card for $1,775.00. I then asked to speak with the front staff lady and said this is not what I agreed to. I spent the entire weekend dealing with an over drafted account that cause numerous other transactions to bounce. I am beyond mad to say the least. If they would have done as I requested originally I would not be in this situation. The front staff should have clearly stated the amount.<//review><user_id>117027988125344879355</user_id><rating>1</rating>< gmapID>

Our manager reached out and offered to pay for the bank fees incurred as a result of this oversight, but we have not yet heard back.  In regards to your dog's surgery, all tests and observations including the fact that your dog had been known to eat objects such as socks was indicative of a possible blockage.  If the decision was made to do nothing, and a blockage was present the result could have been much worse, possibly fatal.  The fact that nothing was found is actually a good thing, and from what we have heard it sounds like your dog is recovering nicely.  The charges incurred included the surgery for $1600 as well as treatment and hospitalization from the previous day which is where the discrepancy seems to be."}</resp>

Although my cat is going great, it is horrible to get you cats records. I no longer live in the area and moved across country and was trying to get my records send to the veterinarian and myself. I spoke to two girls who one told me would send it (never received it) and the other one said she couldn’t.

The girl I had spoken initially agreed to send me records of my pet and send it to the current vet, but when calling the current vet they only had on file two vaccinations. There was no record on his neutering paper work or all his vaccination making me feel like maybe they didn’t vaccinate him, because unlike any other veterinary I have been with other pets,  myrtle takes them to the back to give them their “shot” and doesn’t do it in front of the owner (1 st mistake).  If you’re trying to pull the records of your pet from the online portal, the owner who has access to this only has access to the pets future vaccination and not the previous (2 mistake).

Also if your pet has ear mites they won’t detected it, you have to let them know. (3rd mistake)

The second girl I spoke to got the angry mom asking why the records that were sent were incorrect and why I hadn’t received them. To find out they couldn’t send them to me and would resend to the current vet. I am sorry but I shouldn’t be calling twice for something that could've been done correct in the first place.

Please adjust your online records, and make this a better experience for future animal owners because this is ridiculously frustrating. Any owner should have access to there animals record available, online or in file.</review>< userid>

When I went to pick up my medication for my sick cat I was given three bags of kidney food for my cat. He has kidney failure. When the veterinarian's at this Hospital!! when Bobo needed 14 teeth pulled and they knew I didn't have the money they only charge me 550 entire procedure< /Review>

I cannot say enough wonderful things about this vet. When my dog passed away, they were incredibly kind and let me stay as long as I needed to, making sure to check in on me and see if there was anything they could do. It truly took one of the worst moments of my life and made it more managable. I've taken several pets here throughout the years and have always been treated with respect by all.< /text>

They were sweet hearts. They helped me above and beyond my visit. The receptionist Emily helped me save $100 with a voucher also. This place is just all around great. There's a receptionist there that might not be the most understanding, but if you have this problem ask to speak with someone else.<//review>

Am traveling from Los Angeles to Oregon. My Pom got a tick. I’ve never had to deal with them before. The staff had me come in even though I’m not one of their clients. Not only did they remove the tick for me, they showed me how to do it myself and gave me a tool to remove any more she might get. The cost? Nothing. If I were to be staying in this town I would have found my new vet. Thanks guys!</text>

<Text>See below for original post.

Good news test results came back negative. The office manager was very responsive and immediately contacted me after this review. She said she would educate Dr. Ninekirk and all other staff on proper procedures regarding vaccine boosters when animals come into contact with wild animals. I appreciate their responsiveness and I’m glad that my dog is going to be okay. That being said this should be common knowledge for a trained and licensed medical professional especially since we live in a rural area. I’m glad the staff was so responsive and apologetic, but I wouldn’t feel comfortable taking my animals here again in the future.

My dog got in a fight with a raccoon. Both environmental health and web searches on the internet told me that the rabies vaccine was supposed to be boosted right away. I did not look into this until 3 days after the fact. My usual vet was busy at the time and I trusted this clinic to take care of my dog. I am just hoping and praying that the results come back negative and my dog is okay. I am extremely upset and frustrated that the veterinarian (Dr. Ninekirk) did not offer or mention this when I took my dog in. I consider this malpractice and I hope that my dog and everything is okay. She is up to date on her vaccines so I hope this is enough to protect her, but they are supposed to boost it and they did not even mention this during the visit.</Text>< Pics>

Our dog had a serious injury that was difficult to treat.  All the staff at Myrtle Ave. Vet were helpful and caring. Dr. Richardson was excellent!  He certainly went "above and beyond" to care for our dog. He is a kind, thorough, highly skilled professional that truly cares about his patients. We feel very fortunate that he is our vet.< /Text>

Hey everyone just wanted to let you know what happened to me tonight took my kitten to myrtle avenue vet at 4 pm vomiting up blood.  They wanted 120 dollars to see him plus all other cost to help him. I didn't have all that money. I had been able to pay it off on payday as late as October. Now just so you know I have been going there for over 30 years and spent  well over 100 thousand dollars very little of that on payments. So Thank you myrtle avenue vet for caring more about the money than the animals you are supposed to. By the way my kitten died before I could get him to Arcata  merry Christmas  myrtle avenue vet.</Text>

It’s impossible to get your pet seen in an emergency. And please stop telling me to call right at 8:00, I start calling at 7:59 and try again every 5 seconds (yes, literally. I count). Then you’re put on hold for 5-10 minutes. I guess I’m just going to have find somewhere else. My dog has open sores on her head that are getting worse from some kind of skin infection.<//Text>

Always helped us with our pets.  On Saturday, they have the Vaccine Clinic 12 - 1PM, cheap and fast way to get your pets shots up to date.  Better get their early to get in line, but it's still fun (and covered) waiting with everyone's pets.< /text>

I LOVE Betsy Ninekirk; she was amazing with both of my cats. This office is very busy, and appointments sometimes one week out, to long for some ailments. Also, the lobby used to smell weird -- to the point I wanted to switch vets -- buy they did some remodeling and it's much better!<//review>

No compassion, no care at all!! When I asked the receptionist if she could just give me some hope that my cat was ok by the description of his symptoms, I could wait till the next appointment available on the 26th. I explained that having worked in that environment she should be able to aleast have some knowledge because at that point all I needed to know was if it was an emergency situation. She is apparently not a educated person and learned nothing in her feild on top of having no social skills and a heartless idiot. I doubt anyone has pride in her! My daughter a lead in the Coast Guard could teach her a few things. You made a big mistake on your treatment and I hope your office reaps what you sow!
Do not respond to this message! Nothing you say can convince me of what is truth and recorded. To do so will be used to prove the truth of this matter. Take your 1 star for at least knowing how to answer a phone.</Text>

Insulting our receptionists who are just trying to do their job is mean and unfair. They can only try and determine what is and what is not a true emergency.

<rate>5</rate><Review>We adopted a cat who's owner had passed, and who was a current patient of Myrtle Avenue Veterinary Hospital - so essentially, we adopted them too.  They've always been helpful and nice.  Last week, our other kitten had an accident and we took him in right away, no appointment.  They took him right back and gave him a shot for pain, outlined their plans to help him, and kept in touch throughout the morning until the end.

We received a "Deepest Sympathy" card from the Hospital today with signatures from all the employees.  Service like this is rarely seen anymore.  All our pets are now patients for life!</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

The vets themselves and the front staff are very polite, skilled,  and hardworking. Maybe they used to be the best but there's huge communication issues on their end- I think management is to blame, so maybe that's the change lately. I had to make half a dozen phone calls and confirm several things in person just to get the most basic of information on pricing, appointments, and vouchers, even after giving them a second try after my initial review. All that trouble was very triggering for my severe PTSD, especially the way they misrepresented me to Humdogs and here as someone more interested in getting a spay done than my dog's health. That sort of behavior is not only very petty, but a highly inefficient  use for everyone's time. I will definitely be shopping around in spite of my gratitude and kudos to the vets and staff. There's a bad apple in management and such a thing isn't readily glazed over.</Text>

<review>Bad practice! They dont know their breeds! They almosted killed my english bulldog! Stop pushing vacinnes to create profit! I didnt approve of the vaccine in the first place! Do you get a flu shot? You need to close your doors! They havent heard from me yet, Im still taking care of my dog!

*REPLY* - Yeah just like I said lady, Close your doors or find a real vet to work for your office! And do some research, its now very clear you dont know know what your doing! Do you just hand out vaccines at customers request? Yeah ill take some of that and a little some of that! Come on! You dont give an english bulldog the kennel cough vaccine!! One he wasnt around any other dog, except your office! cough! cough! And he got sick after you gave the vaccine! cough! cough! Call me we can talk if you want to talk, otherwise just shut down shop! If I wasnt in the hospital you would of never have seen my dog! Just because every other mixed breed mutt that comes through your door survives it, doesnt mean its ok for every dog! How much do you make off each one of those vaccines?<//review>< pictures>

A reaction to the vaccines would occur within 24 hours, not 10 days later.  We do not push vaccines on anyone's pets.  You brought your dog in to us to receive required vaccines prior to boarding, something which all boarding facilities require."}< /resp>

We thought it will be difficult and take time as its not easy to keep baby still while haircut  but Ajeet was done in 15 minutes and it was awesome. I will recommend this place if anyone is looking  for baby mundan.</review></record></dataset><record>

I find Ajeet very adamant and arrogant. I went for mundan and he just started without asking anything and did trim full head before head shave. I went for the ritual of my grand mother death and had to keep head pony tail ... But he cleaned full.. His was too adamant and blaming me only telling that he never seen person needing pony tail... Very arrogant person... Just beware if you plan for his service...</review>

Yes, there is pandemic out there and Yes I got my hair cut done nice, clean and more importantly safe.

From scanning body temperature, to, only one person service at at time, to, using plastic sheets and sterile scissors - Ajeet took care of every aspect in-terms of cleanliness and safety.

I would highly recommend this place.< /Text>

Ajeet was excellent with my 2.5 year olds mundan ,done at our house.He was very friendly,patient and worked according to my kids comfort.I was very anxious about my kid not cooperating with him but his friendly approach put my kid at ease.He was very gentle ,calm and confident with his work,going through tricky areas with ease.I highly recommend Ajeets services for kids hair cutting /shaving.He was also very professional in keeping up with safety precautions in view of the current situation.<//Text>

<Text>If the fact that walk-ins are not possible was communicated during the first interaction, I wouldn't have troubled you. But to know that half way in, was really bad customer service.

I am glad that I found Ajeet barber shop. He is pro in this domain and very friendly. Because of his good service he gets super busy with customers so plan your visit properly, specially if you are planning to go over the weekend. In weekends, you have to check-in there in person as early as possible. Hopefully he come up with some alternative where we can checking by phone/app/website etc. But if you don't want to come there and wait, then you can take reservation in weekdays.

He is that good that people don't hesitate to wait to have super nice haircut and other services he provides.

Prices are very reasonable. For my hair cut he charged 20$.<//Review>

Ajeet is very skilled and a professional barber. I really liked the hair cut and the beard lining. This is my first time here and I was very much satisfied with his treatment . Best thing about him is that there is very good communication between me and ajeeth about the best style which suits my face cut .

Thank you<//Review>

<rate>1</rate><review>Will be leaving one star for how my haircut was handled. Came in on Sunday as a walk-in hard to find a place as I just moved here three weeks ago. He tells me people are ahead & writes my name & number & will call me 15 minutes before for when it’s my turn. Which is fine, cool I have no problem waiting for my turn. But he never called me, not even to say he couldn’t do it or reschedule me or anything, totally unprofessional. If that’s the impression he gives to new clients, then I don’t want to come here.

Update: No you wrote my number down, my friend was there when I gave it to you. I gave the correct number same one I’ve had for 6 years. That was your mistake, your fault not mine. Had you just had me sign in myself it wouldn’t of been an issue. Which is a shame as you had good reviews. But will have to look elsewhere most likely as the customer is being blamed.</review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>{'time': 1541392226239, 'text': "I did call you and someone pickup the phone and he said wrong number I wait for you till 7.30 PM I thought you coming again, I have call recording when I Call if you want text me your number I send you call recording,with your number that you writes,if you put phone number wrong that's not my fault\nYour# number is wrong\nI call my every single customers"}<//Response>< gmap_id>

<Review>This is the best barbershop in Fremont. Had one of my best haircuts here. He actually suggests you good hairstyles that suit your face and patiently listens to what you want. I am extremely satisfied with his designs. He actually waited even after closing hours because I told him it was an emergency. Very flexible and definitely knows how to take care of his customers.< /Review>< Date>

Took our son for his Mundan to Ajeet who was very good at his work. The place was Very clean and well attended by other customers. Ajeet made it a point to triple check on our appointment and was super helpful with keeping the kid engaged with cartoons on his Mobile screen while he worked. Also this was a Sunday morning 7am appointment and he was already there waiting for us. Definitely a well deserved 10 stars!< /review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMYvsnkNVB3AYvT4MKuScNEh8YHN7NtcwZ1EbKO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics><resp>{'time': 1528260206638, 'text': 'Thank you'}< /resp>< GmapID>

Was happy with the service (mundan) offered for my 1 yr old. Was very professional and offered directions on how to move around the baby when he was shaving the hair. Happy that he informed how busy he gets and offered to come in earlier than his business hours. Would have given 5 stars if there was a way to distract kids via some videos instead of having to use my phone. Overall, happy.</review>

<text>Ajeet is very skillful in tackling kids to shave the head. He has all equipment ready includinf i pad to divert kids. He is very very patient, tactful and very precise. My son is usually fussy if we touch his head and we were nervous but Ajeet did the shave extremely well and directing us parents to distract the kid skillfully.

It was my first time going to this barber shop, and I did not know that his barbershop goes by appointments. But he was extremely considerate to still give me a haircut, and then told me to come a bit later for my beard trim due to the appointments. When I was getting my haircut and beard trim he was approachable and whatever style you want he would do it exactly like that. So, the service here is amazing. In terms of quality of the haircut and beard trim. It was also great. The haircut didn't take too long and was how I wanted it to be. It was my first time ever getting a beard trim and he did such a good job. I didn't look much in the shop but once I took a good look at home, he really cleaned me up. Thanks!<//Text>

Ajeet is one of the best barber in the Bay Area for not just adults and minor kids but he is definitely a specialist for Mundan(haircut for new born babies). I recommend making an appointment but he always accommodated me even when I walked in without an appointment. Thanks 🙏 Ajeet you are the man.<//Review>

<Review>AJEET is best barber in town I bring my kids for Mundan , Ajeet who did the shaving of hair or known as the Mundan or Mottai in India. When I decided to do the mottai thing, my husband, my mom, and many others were not sure about the need or how we would find someone here in the US. I really wanted to keep the tradition and avoid doing it in India at all costs cuz i could not stomach the hygiene factor. Though the temples offered a mundane service, it was not a proper tonsure like they do in India. Thanks to my fellow Indians who subjected their poor children as well, I found Ajeet Mundan & Barber Shop and we walked away happy customers. Ajeet was really friendly and super sweet to accommodate us even though we were late. He did an excellent job and I felt it was a better mundan than ones done in India. He is super patient with the babies and takes his time to be extra careful and thorough.

It is a shop for kids mundan in fremont and it gets very busy quickly. This seems to be the spot to go if you are looking to do a proper mundan. With that said, the barbers are nice and the place is relatively clean. NoTE-This is perfect shop they have a kids cartoon character on wall it’s look great

Here are some good tidbits to consider:

1. Prepare and plan. You will definitely need two people other than the barber himself. It depends on your kid. Usually mine is Dennis the menace but we were lucky to see the baby go before us to know what to do and what not to do.

2. Make an appointment. If you are going by auspicious times (like my mom forced me to) Ajeet was nice enough to offer to come in at opening but we could not make that time. When we got there, there were already 3 people waiting for him including a baby and it was only 9 am. BE ON TIME and aim for a day that you can get an appointment.

3. Take distractions like an iPhone or iPad (ask for the wifi ahead of you sitting in chair), a friendly grandmother, a clown, whatever to help keep your child distracted.

4. Wear clothes that you don't care if hair gets on them. The baby that went before us had a melt down just at the start of the cover Ajeet tried to put on the mom. Forget covering the kid- its not worth it.

5. Process: first ajeet will buzz off the hair with an electric buzz- it will get to pretty close shave. Then he wets the head slightly and then goes over the head with a sterilized straight razor.

6. Brace yourself. Decide who is going to hold the child. It is best to get someone who the child has best temperament and one other person to hold head (more like put it on lock down) if needed.

My son who was 17 months old surprisingly didn't fuss much, to my surprise. The baby before us screamed for mercy- so again it depends on your child. During the straight blade part, Ajeet suggested not to hold head to see how he reacts and honestly he just sat watching Moana (for the 10935935 time

7. Once Ajeet is done with the straight razor, he put powder on the head and covered any missing spots. bring a large zip lock bag if you want to take it back to donate to the temple, etc.

9. We changed our son and wiped him down in our car. I brought a big sheet to catch any hair that may fall. It took him some time and he was missing his long hair

*bring cash- if you use CC- then its Extra $ charge*

Don’t Fear,You're in great hands!< /Review>< response>

When we showed up, we stood there waiting for 15 mins before she even came to help us, and right off the bat she gave us attitude for no reason, treated us as if we were bothering her. On the phone she said 20 minutes, so we showed up 25 mins later, and she hadn’t even started making our order yet. I asked if I could speak to the manager, she said “I’m the owner”, then she told us “you can wait, I’m not in a rush” and walk to the back. Worst experience I have ever had. We left</text>< Pictures>

<Review>Customer service is the worst here, the female who claims to be the owner has the worse attitude and claimed that i went in there with an attitude bcuz she did not like how i placed my card on the counter during a pandemic while she was working on my pizza, which by the way were already 10 mins later then the time she told they would be ready by. I use to love this place and hadnt been here in years due to the change in the pizza recipe, never was the same since the new ownership and now to have to deal with employees like this, no thank you. Oh and she refused to make my order. It didnt start here, just how it ended. I think she was offended when i asked for the prices of the pizza when my total came out to $81 for 3 XL, gave ME attitude as she broke it down and asked if i still wanted to place the order. Smh i dont understand how small business owner behave in this manner during a time where small business are not surviving due to the pandemic. In my opinion go to Chicos in lynwood, way better pizza and even better waaay better service. Never had a bad experience at Chicos!!!< /Review>< userid>

Last week was our first time we came to that good restaurant. But It is no doubt not the last. We had a good time with the courteous service, with the superb  food and fine drinks and with the comfortable charge. We will definitely visit there again.</text>

The pizza is good. All their food is very tasty but I do have one issue. They use canned mushrooms. Ugh canned mushrooms are so gross. I understand why they choose to use them. It's difficult to keep fresh mushrooms stocked but canned mushrooms are still nasty and rubbery and taste yucky. Other than that, I haven't anything to complain about. It's a good, well priced pizza joint.<//Text>

<Text>It use to be the best pizza in town but now theres no cheese on the pizza. When i called to advice that our pizza did not have any cheese, the rude girl that answered the phone told me that they measure all their ingredients and there was nothing she can do about it. You would think that they will like to please their customers but not them.</Text>< pictures>

<rating>2</rating><Review>There's nothing original about the food since the original owners sold out in the 80s, food is far from Italian with sub-par ingredients being used. Canned Mushrooms on the Pizza? What the hell ! Also You don't use pasta sauce on a pizza, they're two different sauces for a reason. If you don't know what REAL Italian food is then go to Giullianos in Gardena still Family owned and operated by the Son's of Italian Immigrants, the real deal.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None< /Response>< Gmap_id>

The establishment looks dirty and not well taken care of. Only two employees working on a sunday afternoon. I ordered a meat lovers pizza to get only two pieces of meat per slice. This set me back $22 dollars. WTH!!!!</Text>

<Text>Spotless place to live, green lawns, friendly people, who know, everyone and are concerned for all. The only thing that was missing was to watch neighbors in their robes, bunny flipflops strugling to reach over the white picket fence to hand over the cup of sugar

<text>Well, it's in the mall, which luckily for them during a pandemic, means they have outdoor seating (and not a bad location for it either). The Bento box lunch filled me up. I think I like my tempura cooked just a tad longer, as some larger pieces were between gooey and gummy against the veggie skin. Otherwise, service speed, and overall presentation and flavor was excellent 👌.</text>< pics>

<Review>This is truly the last resort sushi restaurant for us. The service here is, at times, careless. If you're not a sushi fanatic, the food is fine. Overall, more misses than hits.< /Review>< response>

< review>
2 spicy Tonkatsu ramens, one with chicken and one with pork belly. This place has the best ramen I've had in a restaurant. Every restaurant I've been to had bland ramen, but sake sushi hits those taste buds.
I've had the shuyo and miso ramen as well, but It has been a while.
The pork belly is tender, with a bit of fat on it; it has a really good flavor to it. The chicken has no flavor but its still good with the broth. The noodles are PERFECT, not aw mushy, they are a perfect al dente. Overall this place always hits the spot, even on a hot day lol.
If you like ramen and find it hard to find a really good ramen place, THIS place can definitely fill the craving.< /review>

<review>I LOVE it here! I would eat here for lunch at least twice a week. The staff is delightful. The food is delicious, and the service is always super quick. Granted I would usually go in the middle of the day on weekdays. Regardless, it would definitely be worth a wait!< /review><user>117345641669287052949</user><rate>5</rate></record></dataset><record>

I walked In and was greeted with friendly service. I ordered a rainbow roll and it was delivered to my table in like 60 seconds.  So amazing. Very tasty. Was asked multiple times how everything was and if I needed anything. Place was clean...  I really like this place for quick friendly service and acceptable quality rolls.< /Review>

On out roadtrip in West USA, we wanted some sushi. Sake sushi is part of a shopping mall. The staff is very friendly and the sushi was excellent. For 8 big maki with crab the price is around 7 dollar. Sushi was fresh and the rolls where also very good. I would definitely recommend this place for a quick sushi stop.<//review>

Wow, I'd give them 0 stars if possible. Here's the scenario,  we walked in were told to sit down. We sat down waiting for menus and a drink order so did a pair of gentlemen. Then three people showed up there was no place for them to sit. They arrived after us and the gentlemen.  They proceed to clean the table for the three of them, the other gentlemen left. I was fine till they came back with menus for the three that arrived after us and the other gentlemen. I got so piss ed off we also left. Here's a tip for the manager who wasn't there. Teach your employees that you attend to people as they arrive. First come first served. Not serve as you wish. YOU LOST FOUR OTHER CUSTOMERS TO ATTEND TO THREE. LET'S DO THE MATH? 4 $17.00 MEALS SERVED OR THREE. HOW ABOUT SEVEN. HIRE NEW MANAGEMENT AND STAFF OR YOU'LL SOON GO UNDER AND WONDER WHY.</Text>

For this location, the 3 others rate much lower, as the website says subway is one of the places which accept EBT cards, this Subway does, the others don't, yummy sandwiches and large, large sized drinks<//Text>

I go there most every 30 days for my doctors appointments.  Small comfy store with seating and tables. Never had a bad service or meal from there.  The 2 girls are wonderful and likeable.<//Review>

What happened to the $5 footlong? Not the promotional ones they sometimes do now, but I’m talking about the good ole days when all footlongs were just $5. Did you guys get greedy or did the costs actually go up that much? All I know is I’m paying more for a sub that did not increase in size or quality.< /review>

I know you shouldn't expect much from a subway store bit this one sucks more than any others. Employees are consistently unhappy and they have the guts to sell sandwiches with breads from yesterday. Even heating the bread doesnt help as it becomes stone hard. Will never make the mistake to step in there.< /Text>

Service was alright, but the place was in a bit of disarray. Only one person behind the counter and most of the veggies were not fresh, indicating this place doesn't do a lot of business.</Review>

Justin was fabulous but you definitely need a new phone person !it’s your calling card and that gentleman fails big time ! My grandfather started our Chevrolet dealership in New York just over 100 years ago, curry chevrolet , which is still family owned with other dealerships of course so I know something about the business ! You have to respect your calling card which is your operator so I suggest you do something about his ineffiency’ it makes you look and sound bad! Had I not used you for the last 10 years I would have hung up and gone anyplace else!< /review>

The gentleman at the counter was very helpful and professional. The only complaint I have was the mud inside my car and on the tires and some on the car. My vehicle had just been detailed 2 days prior and to see all that mud on the bottom door panel and carpet, well I want to happy about that.</Text>

Michael is a phenomenal salesman. As expected it is a fairly long process when buying a new car. Michael made it a wonderful experience. He found me the exact truck I wanted at a great price. I have looked at dealerships all over the internet and no one beat your price. Michael and the sales manager were able to obtain the payments that were affordable for me. Also, the computer signing was a breeze. Great job LaQuinta Chevrolet, you have my business for life! More importantly, I love the truck. Kudos to the GM designers and thanks to all the great people who made buying a new car a pleasurable experience especially Michael who never left me just sitting there. He always checked to see if I needed anything and kept me informed through the process!< /Review>

Asked Ilene to confirm the price and financing options, which she did.  Although the dealership closed at 7PM and we weren't planning to make the purchase until the following day, we were in an out in practically no time at all.  In fact the test drive took longer than the paperwork.  That's a first for me and outstanding service.< /Text>

Your team, Carlos and Christian treated us real well and we enjoyed working with them. When I first called around looking for certain car with a certain color they we're the only ones that responded with photos and details. We have bought several vehicles locally in the Imperial Valley and found it worth our while to travel to your dealership. You can be proud of both Carlos and Christian and the gentleman in finance who's name I can't remember.</review>

I brought my chevy cruze in to switch from lease to purchase and a wonderful young man named David helped me. VERY personable and informative. He even went out of his way to get my husband a better chair. They gave me a great deal and were patient with my questions.

<Review>Nice clean deal, sales staff excellant, I had a good experience and would recommend this dealership.  Note: have all your ducks in a row before you sit down to deal,  value of your trade-in, what you will pay on the new vehicle, and expectations you have for incentives.  Makes things go faster when both sides know what to expect.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

< Review>
I had a appointment for Tuesday 11/10/20 for 10:30am.  I arrived at the dealership at 10:12 am and was greeted by a gentleman and asked if I had a appointment.  I told him I did and provided my name for verification he then asked if the keys were in the vehicle and I told him yes.  I asked where the restroom was and he told me where it was.  He then asked if I would be waiting for the vehicle i said yes.  He told me I could wait inside.  At 10:30 I noticed my vehicle wasn't in yet and I assumed they were probably running behind.  At 10:45 the same gentleman came into the service waiting area and told me I need to have the service writer write up my service.  News to me as he never said that when I got there.  I went to the service writer and had him write it up.  He then asked if I would like a car wash and I said yes.  He told me my vehicle would be ready about 1hr 15 minutes.  So I figured it would be ready about 12.  At 12:15 still nothing so I walked outside and noticed they were still working on the vehicle as the hood was up.  I went back in to the waiting room until 12:30 and still wasn't done so I went outside again and noticed someone was washing the vehicle.  At about 12:45 I was notified that my vehicle was ready and just sign here.  I was then told that my vehicle was parked outside the waiting area.  I got on my vehicle and went to the store and when I got out the roof of my truck was still dirty and not washed or even touched.  How do you wash a vehicle without washing the entire vehicle.
If you note from the time of arrival to the time of departure it was 2 1/2 hours.   Not one person said anything to me.as to sorry about the delay or sorry about any confusion.  NOTHING
I'm from a different state and thought I would use them for service because of the reviews.  Boy was I wrong.  I've been a Chevrolet owner for over 30 years and have never been treated like this anywhere.< /Review>

When you have people like Henry Hodges helping you he makes you feel relaxed. The guy is a great guy to have assist you. He explains what's going to happen with your vehicle and what he tells you he means it. He helps you with what he can in a professional way but still by the books. A person having this kind of service to offer I will return to have my cars serviced with his team.< /text>

<text>Upon arriving I stood waiting for someone to acknowledge I was there for about 10 mins over my appointment time. I was advised later that day that the mechanics couldn’t figure out what was wrong with my truck so they contacted gm and would keep me updated. I didn’t hear anything back that day and they kept my truck overnight without advising me. I had to call to get a status in my truck the next day at 2pm. I was then asked what module was underneath my dash that the mechanics found. They had no idea it was a gps for low Jack that was installed by chevy. I was then told they still couldn’t figure out what was wrong with my power steering and to come pick up my truck. They told me to drive it around and if my power steering went out again to just bring it back. Pretty unprofessional in my opinion also dangerous since in 2015 Chevy trucks had this problem and were causing accidents. When I arrived the second time to pick up my truck I again waited before having to walk up to a random employee and ask if I could be helped. Overall not pleased.</text><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>{'time': 1615340594981, 'text': 'Michael,\nWe would like to apologize for not meeting your expectations. It is noted about your arrival and departure waiting to be addressed for help and we are sorry about that experience. GM supported repairs due to take longer due to process.

<rate>5<//rate><text>On Sunday 1/31/21, Shortly after leaving on a 500-mile trip from La Quinta to Lake Tahoe with my dog and young granddaughter,  I had a “check engine” light and message come on relating to the exhaust Fluid System.  Knowing the truck would shut down after so many miles I returned to La Quinta to have La Quinta Chevrolet check it out on Monday morning.  I was the first customer arriving in Service and was greeted by Scott Coletto.  I explained my situation to him, and he was extremely sympathetic to my issue and advised me he would get it right in for a diagnosis.  Within a few hours Scott called and advised of the findings, Nox Sensor and Exhaust Temperature sensor.  He assured me it would be fixed by the end of the day which it was.  Scott was extremely professional and committed to helping me get back on the road.  Thanks to him my stress level went down quickly.  Scott is a great asset to La Quinta Chevrolet.

<Review>It was a good experience; would have wanted more variety of cars to choose from, but we still found what we wanted. Ilene was nice and she followed up with us after the purchase, it was greatly appreciated; made the experience more personal. That’s going above and beyond; the extra mile that people remember and want to come back For future vehicles. Would recommend to others.</Review>< Pictures>

The actual guy that I had spoken to was not there to finish the transaction cause of a personal issue.  Like any sale it takes hours to get out of there.  But all in all it was a good experience!! I had actually posted a bad review earlier but after I was schooled about buying a car, I understood I was wrong.  But they do need to explain the actual value of each of the extras you add to your purchase not how much you payment goes up!!! That’s what threw me off and thought I was being hassle.  The credit guy was a nice guy and he was doing his job and explained each extra but not the actual price of each extra.  Only how much your payment would go up! But all in all I do recommend this dealership!!

Went here because I seen a Buick Lacrosse that was certified. When I got there me and wife were greeted by Miguel Flores. We went on test drive after we returned to do paperwork. Miguel was informed that the car was already sold. So we decided to test drive an Impala. But did not like it.
We thanked Miguel for his time and left. About a week later I would see the car for sale at the dealer using gm certified pre-owned website. I called Miguel to setup an appointment to buy the car. He informed me that he was going to be off the next day. But one of his co-workers would help me and wife out. Wife and me drove out there Sergio was helping us out this time. Wife did credit application Sergio said best apr was 4.99 for 60 months. I informed him that was higher then what we wanted. He informed me what apr was I looking to get I told him 3 percent.
He informed me that not even on new cars he would do that. Bs gm has at the time 0.9 apr on new cars. I told Sergio that for about 40 dollars. More of payment I can get a new Toyota Camry 2020 with 0 apr for 60 months. Me and wife walked out.  Also wife's credit score is 826.
Two days later we walked to our local Toyota dealer an got a new Camry. Thanks to Sergio.
But Miguel is top notch and a great guy. Would recommend him.I guess they would rather send the car to the action block.</Review>

We brought in our Yukon Denali for shaking at low acceleration speed.  Henry our service advisor was amazing to deal with a world of expedite and knowledge.  We had tried several times to fix the same issue and all other dealers had charged us over $1100 each time only to have the same issue again.   He was extremely knowledgeable and found a bulletin that is a common issue with this make and model.  He even went above and beyond and contacted GMC to warranty the item and not only we didn’t have to pay anything we got a $1100 REFUND ! I I have worked in this industry for over 27 years and have not ever received such great service at any dealership even though we have dealt with many luxury brands.   We highly recommend La Quinta  Chevy and Cadillac be sure you ask for Henry if you are planning to visit La Quinta Chevy or Cadillac.    Thank you team for such amazing experience specially Henry and Gus.  We will service our cars here and will purchase our vehicles here as well and recommend all our  friends and family as well.</review>

Best customer service I have EVER had. Sergio Aguilar our auto dealer was very knowledgable, honest, and really showed he cared. Helped me get the truck I've always wanted for the best price possible. We will be doing business again thanks to Sergio. Anyone in the market for a new car, truck, SUV, I definitely recommend shopping here.<//Text>

Joshua is one of the better salesman I have delt with. He's so good. In fact, I bought another vehicle from them and could not be happier with the vehicle or the service from this dealership.</review>

<Review>This dealer not only has a great inventory, but a sales and sales management team that respects its customers. I drove from San Diego because of their professionalism, and would buy another vehicle from La Quinta without hesitation. Job well done, Chevrolet and GM need to be on top where they once were, and make America Great Again...<//Review>< Pics>

< review>
I had an amazing new experience at La Quinta Chevrolet.  My past experience in car buying was always such an inconvenience and such a hassle.  Josh was truly a great help and a great salesman.  His concerns for customer satisfaction were amazing.  I never in the past had such a helpful salesperson.  His dedication in setting up my On Star on my new vehicle as well as making sure everything in my new vehicle was taken care of.  They really did give me the best possible deal they could based on my credit.  I was truly surprised at their dedication and smoothness of my transitioning into my new vehicle.  A week later I am still impressed and truly amazed.  Thank you for keeping all your promises and the extras I received.   I love the rewards you offered and I feel as if I came out like a champ and feeling proud to be a Chevy Owner.  I am already and definitely recommending this dealership to everyone,  in the market to making your new vehicle experience a great experience.  Thank You La Quinta Chevrolet and Josh Bott for all your professionalism and making me feel like a Queen.< /review>

The people were nice. The showroom was also very nice.  It is frustrating when you have to teach the salespeople about the cars they are trying to sell you.  Maybe that is why Tesla is doing so well.< /text>

<date>1554855311441<//date><Text>This dealership is completely satisfactory. I have been talking to Michael Kingsbury about the 2012 Kia Sorento that I bought in Kia dealership at Cathedral City that I went underwater due to big drop of value. I also have bad credit and only have $500 to put down. After dealing with alot of different dealership in Cathedral City Auto Mall including Kia dealership that don't even try to qualify me and they all just turn me away. Michael ask me to come in and he will work with me. The day I came in for my appointment, Michael happen to be off but his there attending other customer that was ahead of me, so he hand me over to Carlos Castillo and right away Carlos did his work and got me testing driving the vehicle I want. Unfortunately it was way above my limit. But him and his boss didn't stop there, his boss quickly go on a hunt and find something that I could qualify for and he did. My wife and I went home with a 2019 Chevy Equinox thesame model in just a lower trim submodel. This dealership went above and beyond and I was super super completely satisfied with the service and hospitaly. The owner of this Laquinta Chevrolet Dealership should be proud of his team. Thank you to the owner, Carlos Castillo, Michael Kingsbury and Dominique in finance and to the lovely smile of the receptionist. You guys got my loyalty and will not go any where else for as long as the people here in this dealership stay this way helping people like me...... THANK YOU GUYS!!!<//Text>< userid>

Received a notice from Chevrolet concerning a recall for my vehicle. I made an appointment for an inspection, which revealed that the lower control arms were defective. I made an appointment to return the car for repair under the recall. I checked with the dealership later and was told that the parts were not ordered because I had not correctly set up the recall appointment. I was advised that the parts were on indefinite back order. One nice thing is that the dealership provided me a loaner at no cost.<//Text>

Scott in service was very good and friendly. He went out of his way to help me. However the computers were down and  lost 30 minutes in waiting time for them to come on line.. Also I made an appointment on line and when I got to the service dept. there was no record of my appointment for 10AM. I'm sure my next visit will be better<//Text>

Been taking my truck there for oil changes. I purchased the 3 package deal twice already. Every time ive taken it back been great service. I thought because I bought a deal i would be treated inferior when I came for the next change, Not all. Great service.
I had a different ABS light come on when I left. I called them and they said bring it in. I have yet to bring it in so ill update.  But id recommend.</text><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

While it took quite awhile (as it does at any dealership), we were able to drive away in the car that we wanted, for the price that we wanted, and they were even great with the kids while we were busy talking numbers and all. Joseph took time to actually play with our 3 year old that was getting restless and bouncing a ball through the dealership! Wonderful people, and they work hard to get you where you need to be so you can drive home in the car you want.< /review>

Michael Kingsbury and some guy named “Raul” used aggressive sales tactics that did not comport with what Michael Kingsbury described as a “family-owned business” that is always willing to “work” with customers.
Maybe next time, Michael Kingsbury and “Raul”, you can take the time to listen to, understand, and, if you’re really interested in getting better reviews on Google and elsewhere, educating a potential customer as to how the whole process works given their unique situation.
The condescending and pompous attitudes you both exhibited are shameful.

<review>The service here was excellent.  They described all issues with my vehicle and didnt try to hard sell or pressure me into making the recommended services.  Justin was excellent in detailing the issue with the left front wheel hub as well as other recommendations.  I didnt have to wait for my vehicle all day -it was done within 3 hours! Just fabulous!<//review>< Pictures>

<text>I am very Pleased with the People and Services at LaQuinta Chevy. I highly recommend them. I have a new 2018 Equinox and there are some paint chips in the body of my new car so I bought a Paint Pen to touch up the areas, but the color didn't match so they refunded my money that I paid for the Paint Pen. They did a good job on my first Oil Change and Tire Rotation.</text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

<Review>Went into this Chevrolet for the first time since I’m new to the area for a oil change on my boyfriends corvette and as soon as we walk in  we got no greeting, no anything period. Mind you there is 3 employees in the building and we aren’t even sure whom to speak to. After standing there for 5 mins my boyfriend finally speaks out can someone help us? When these people are no more then 5 feet in front of us. One man answers us VERY RUDELY to the point I don’t even want us to help us anymore. Didn’t apologize for having us wait there like we were like if we were bothering them with our business.  They made us feel So welcomed. CUSTOMER SERVICE IS EVERYTHING! Will not be returning.</Review><gmap_id>0x80daf8fe8e6e54d3:0xca3d2b3cf1cb1515< /gmap_id><rating>1</rating></record></dataset><record>

<text>My family went in to purchase a vehicle for my daughter. We were pre-approved through Bank of America and they're the only Bank of America approved dealer near us. We found a vehicle, I gave them my pre approval number, purchased the vehicle, reiterated 2 more times I wanted my financing through B of A, and 3 weeks later I find out that we were financed through a different bank (small print). I went in to have the contract revised and I was refused and told to refinance through B of A. The finance person texted the B of A rep for the dealer and when she called back he silenced his phone. I filed a complaint with the Bank of America Escalation supervisor last week. This week I am buying my wife a car and you can guess where Im not going.</text>< Rating>

Best experience I've ever had at a dealership, got the car I wanted at a very reasonable price. I told them what I wanted and how much I could spend and they made it happen. I would highly recommend this dealership to anyone! I drove all the way from Twentynine Palms and when the staff heard I am a Marine everyone went out of there way to ensure my family and I were getting taken care of, even bringing toys for my 2 year old daughter to play with. If you are military this is the place for you, well worth the drive and you know your getting a great car at a great price.< /Text>

It is always a pleasure to work with this dealership. I have owned other new vehicles and experienced other dealers. However, Chevrolet Cadillac of La Quinta is by far the best. I can make an appointment easily and get my 2010 Traverse LTZ into the shop where I feel that my car is getting the best care available. My car is always returned to me clean and in good working order. The staff at the dealership is very professional, friendly and pleasant.<//text>

My experience with La Quinta Chevrolet is exceptional. Cindy and I met Joshua Bott when out looking for a quality used car. We stopped by after visiting other dealers. Upon the first interaction with Josh we knew we were in the right place. His customer service is beyond amazing. He was friendly, honest and made our experience very pleasant. I've worked in customer service over 20 years and know extremely, exceptional, customer service, and Joshua Bott is providing that type of customer service. His approach to selling and making the experience easy is tremendous. Everyone we met at La Quinta Chevrolet provided excellent customer service. I highly recommend them. We'd also like to mention Erik Gonzalez. Outstanding customer service. Erik is always available and provided us with first class service. We felt very comfortable with everyone on the staff. The entire experience was very well received, we are appreciative of the remarkable service this dealership provides. Thank you for your dedication to us and again for the quality customer service.< /text>

Was up for diagnostics the forth of July week.  They found a so called oil leak that the guy acted like I should know about, doesn't exist and when they sent me the service card, it became plural oil leaks.  Checked the engine, where I park my car in the garage and work and oddly enough there was no oil  from this leak.  It also has a recall for the ignition switch, which as long as I  own the car will not be fixed.  My Husband doesn't want it done, yet it was supposidly discussed, but not one word was said about it when I dropped the car off.  Was on the service form.  So, in other words, make sure you read that before you sign it, they'll slip extra services in on you.  In closing, I have owned a Chevy for the last 33 years and this place and company has turned me off so badly that my next new car won't be one of theirs, nor of the chevolet  brand</review>

<Text>Chevy La Quinta is the only place you should shop for your next vehicle, friendly and very considerate of what you bring to the table! Honest and very big hearted people who aren't there for the paycheck, consumer minded and personable. Thanks Chevy for the latest addition, now I can cruise around in style.<//Text>< Pictures>

< Review>
Have had multiple problems since taking my vehicle in. Vehicle is worse then first going in.  Back pillars are still wrong and now scratches on bumper and doors caused by the dealership.  AC still doesn't feel right.  Straight edge razor blade was left in the vehicle, which I have 3 kids, one being two years old and loves to play in the vehicle.  The first time screws were left in the back and now that?  Ugly oil marks on inside of car.  Car has been to a dealership three times within 4 weeks of ownership.  Needs to go back the fourth time to fix the things this specific dealership did.  On top of that my 2017 Tahoe still isn't right. Make sure you inspect your vehicle before going home.  Good times... Thanks for asking< /Review>

<date>1507682672877<//date><rating>1</rating><text>Went in for an oil change and was told it would take 1 to 1 1/2 hours with the car washed. I do believe the oil change was done quite quickly, however it took an extremely long time for the car wash. I've seen 8 year olds do a better job at washing cars. The truck doesn't even look like it was washed, there is mud on the tail gate and bumper, dirt still visible on the sides, tires still dirty, and the hood has streaks of dirt across the center. Perhaps they just sprayed it with water for looks. I had to go find the service manager to get my truck back due to the length of time it was taking.< /text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

Very difficult to reach a service advisor by going through the automated phone system. Once I had spoken with someone and got my request rolling, the communication was good. The estimated price for the repair needed was very high. I ended up having the work done at a local mechanic for approx $1000 less than was quoted by your dealership. That is the reason I would hesitate to recommend the dealership for service. My situation was unique in that I was traveling and had to work with the dealership by phone from approx 80 miles away. I do appreciate that I was allowed to leave my vehicle on the lot for a few days until I could return and pick it up.<//Text>

I get to the dealership. I go to Justin's office. He was not there. The young lady that seats by his side. Said Justin will be right back. I waited for almost 10 minutes. Why didn't she page him and tell him that i was waiting in there? When he walked in after 10 minutes smelling like a ashtray. He walks right by me no good morning, no how are you today, sorry for the wait, nothing. I have been in customer service for many years this is not how treat a customer. So anyways he ignores me completely. He gets on the phone and calls another customer skips me. He can just check me in real fast i have appointment after all. Then he his on the call for another 5 minutes. Still not even acknowledge me. He is acting like my money doesn't even count. I have bought 3 cars thru you guys. Then he gets off the phone and starts to help me. Then my dash board cluster is very dim. The car only has 58k miles on it. 2017 Chevrolet traverse. He wants to charge 140 dollars to look at it. Then he wants to charge me nearly $600 dollars to change 2 tire sensor's. Somebody slashed my tires, So spent 800 bucks on 4 brand new tires, 80 bucks to change a cabin air filter. filter is just 5 bucks. Then car took almost 2 hrs to complete, he knew i was waiting in the dealership for the car.. I asked Justin what was taking so long. He said there just behind. It was waiting for 10 to 15 minutes for a wash. I have it on camera.  I just bought 2019 Chevrolet traverse. I don't think i will own another Chevrolet again. You guys have terrible customer service. I fill like a just a number. I know how i should be treated. I fill like not even going back ever again.<//Text>

<date>1470077674239< /date><Rating>1</Rating><Text>This happened a while ago. I drove my truck out here to get it checked out before having to make a drive all the way to the east coast. I'd had no previous trouble with the truck. The service guy -JOE GUTIERREZ- tells me that my transmission is ruined and won't even get me back to base (29 palms) an hour away. Insists that I replace the whole thing for almost 4k. This was not an option as I was leaving town less than a week later. So I drove it back to base (successfully), then across the country (successfully), then I used it every day for about 3 months. Finally I took it in somewhere else to get it looked at, and the guy tells me I can EASILY get another 10,000 miles out of my transmission. So take my advice and get a 2nd opinion, then maybe a 3rd cause La Quinta is shady. Oh, and JOE GUTIERREZ is a turd. 0/10 would not recommend.< /Text>< Pics>

<review>Called in and gave info promised everything was fine with a vehicle on Sunday and previously for a week. Went on a Monday my day off. When I arrived after driving an hour and a half. Supposedly the car was sold the night before. Wasted my time from 1230-6:00pm. To find out all the promises and assurances over the phone before I went and he didn't even let me know about the car being sold before I left that morning after he called me saying everything was fine. Horrible service. They don't know half of whats going on in their own dealership. Promises galore. Nobody wants your friendship just a vehicle.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

<review>I wish they would've kept the ownership the same.  We Met Josh Isbell, the owner's son and he told us that he would help us out and take care of us we went on a test ride of the vehicle and he was very egotistical. Since he was young we Looked over that trait. We went back today to finish up the deal,  he was working at the dealership, we were there for over three hours, and he never came over once  to help. The service we received was awful. This would've been the second time I purchased a vehicle from the dealership. Sad to say I will never go back there. They should've stayed in Simi Valley.  There is no place in the desert for service such as this.</review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>{'time': 1547171945893, 'text': 'Marcella,\nWe are disappointed by your feedback as well as respect for our ownership. When you question our integrity and competence on first test drive demonstration due to our age or history, it is quite disrespectful. We don’t condone talking down or profiling anyone. We were nothing but transparent with your quotes. Credit was not pulled out of respect for your privacy. Yet you claim we weren’t working to get you the best deal? This is very disappointing to see disrespect in a simple test drive and now yelp. Please be nicer to the representative on any test drive you do at any other dealership. We wish you the very best on getting someone to meet your standards when you treat people with this level of respect. If you wish to deal with us direct, we will be happy to hear from you.\n\nThank you,\n\nLa Quinta Chevrolet Cadillac Family'}</Response>< Gmap_id>

<text>Great cars, friendly salesmen but when I totaled my car and went to ask for a refund on extended warranty and gap insurance I had to keep bugging and it took them 4 months to give me the check even though the check was dated 2 months earlier.

<Text>I came in on a scheduled appointment at 0830 didn't leave until after 1300!!! For an oil change and to replace a serpentine belt; which the old one was never found and given to me!! Jose Herrera was more concerned with the fact that the pizza they ordered had arrived and everyone was "busy" that's why no one was able to locate the old serpentine belt!! I will never go back!! It's a shame because I had taken this same vehicle to MyChevrolet of Salinas, California and had never had a problem!!

Couldn't get a hold of anyone all day in the service dept even after leaving several messages until the receptionist picked up due to no one answering in service dept. Was told the driver was on the way back to dealership and would be right over to pick me up. 45 mins l later I had to again call the dealership as driver never showed up and I was told oh there was a problem and they would now send driver to pick me up.

<Review>Update: I would like to change my rating after the new owners made the situation right. I spoke with the new owner which he was onsite when I was dealing with this issue. He reassured me that he would take care of it and did. My truck was damaged when the previous owners were in charge and they wanted to fix it their way but after the first attempt looked horrible, I wanted to choose my own body shop. This business is now family owned and operated and they service my personal and fleet vehicles. They do an amazing service job and Henry is the best! I referred my father to them and he purchased a new 2500 diesel LTZ from them.

Stay away!! I brought my 2017 Chevrolet 2500 Silverado for a simple oil change and they damaged my fender! They tried having it fixed but it looks like a 6 year old tried fixing it. I have spent 2 weeks calling Dan their service manager and he finally called me back after 2 weeks and calling corporate and he wants me to take it to their repair facility. He said the dealer wanted to keep it off insurance and they would pay cash for it. After the body work their guy did I don’t want anyone they have touching my 60k truck, I will take it to the repair facility of my choice now. The service advisors at this location are great but the management here is complete garbage! I would expect this type of service from jiffy lube, not a reputable Chevrolet dealer. I cannot believe they would risk losing a customer over a couple hundred dollars. Please, if you’re considering a dealership or a repair facility, I recommend you save yourself some headache and use another one.</Review><Gmap_id>0x80daf8fe8e6e54d3:0xca3d2b3cf1cb1515<//Gmap_id><Resp>{'time': 1545510106577, 'text': 'Rose,\nWe would like to apologize for your negative experience in the past.

<Text>We were about to get service for a lost key and keyfob while we were traveling they made room for us and assured us everything would be ok, they were even going to give us a discount, right before they were to start working on our issue, the hotel called us and stayed they had found the key the night prior. So we canceled just in time the staff there were very professional and understanding, after talking with one of the members and asking how could I clean a huge greas mark let by another Chevrolet dealer in Tucson (Watson) he had one of his detailed look at it and the cleaned up 90% of the stain the other 10% was too far embedded bu Watson Chevrolet, yet it looks very clean compared to before. Next time I stop in Palm Springs I will visit just to say hello, over buy my next vehicle from when I'm ready.< /Text>< Pics>

<text>I gotta say I usually don't leave a review for a car dealership, but I'm pretty darn happy with our company's truck purchase and with La Quinta Chevrolet. Our real estate company bought a Silverado and drove it off the lot with equity in it, according to Kelley Blue Book. Our sales rep was Ilene and her manager Eddie did what they could to fimd the right truck. 5 stars as far as we are concerned!<//text>< pics>

Took the Cadillac in  on Dec 3 for a clunk on driver side. Picked it up Dec 8 now clunk on passenger  side. Took it right back over. You kept it for almost a week and were unable to offer us a loaner. We had to wait longer for warrantee insurance inspection. CAR WAS supposedly repaired ,took it back next morning Saturday.  Joe said no loaner so take it home for weekend . On Monday took Cadillac in and got loaner. Picked up car on Wed and problem still not corrected. Being that I took it in 3 times and they worked on I don't feel your techs are qualified. Called 6hours ago to Joe and manager Dan today and no return call.<//text>

Towed in my Chevy Malibu 2015, due to my battery completely dying at the lights on my way from work.The cust serv rep wasn't aware my car needed a "special kind of battery" which cost me almost $400 to replace, misquoted at a difference of $90 plus $100 extra for the technician since it was a "complicated battery". Prices outrageous for a simple replacement. Don't even want to imagine how expensive other parts might cost....wouldn't have purchased this vehicle if I had known this.</text>

<Review>Service writer Val was prompt about letting me know cost to my repairs, but when I called 6 times to leave messages that I need to be picked up and is my car ready no one will answer and transfer me to a generic voice mail, spoke to Anthony GM very helpful to explain it Hqrts has a new phone service implemented so for some don't expect a call back if you get that generic voice mail. :/</Review>< name>

<Review>Called Cadillac of La Quinta and scheduled an oil change for 11 a.m. this morning. Arrived at the dealership at 10:53 a.m. The service adviser wrote up my car and after signing the paperwork, he let me know that it will be a couple of hours. Sounds odd for just an oil change... Looked at the paperwork, and to my surprise, the date promised said 12/22/2017 - 6:00 p.m.

In whose right mind is an oil change supposed to take 7 hours to complete??? I've worked in service before and can tell you that it shouldn't even take an hour. And what do you expect me to do in these 7 hours? Sit in your crammed waiting room that barely had enough seats for all of your WAITING customers? I had an APPOINTMENT! I mean, it's not like you are going to give me a loaner for an oil change, so why make customers wait 7 hours on their car after a scheduled appointment? This place makes no sense.

And don't get me started on the price, $54.00 for a NON-SYNTHETIC swap, as per RO. The owner's manual for the 6.2L recommends a BLEND; but just FYI, you can get Mobile 1 FULL-Synthetic Dexos Certified and a premium filter for less than their price at your local auto parts stores. I don't mind paying, but at least be reasonable and offer a positive experience.

When you buy and expensive Cadillac, you would expect a certain standard beyond the showroom and the warranty life of your car. Just because I didn't buy my car here, doesn't mean that I'm worth less than the customers who did. If the service is on par with my expectations, I would definitively drop my money here and have work done. Sadly, that isn't the experience I had today. I ended up leaving before my car even left your service drive.< /Review>< Pictures>

I went today to get a new key ordered it through the phone about two days ago sent in got it but to my surprise the key wasn't cut and when I asked they said yes walked to the back came back 2 minutes later told me they couldn't cut it so now I'm stuck with a worthless key. Told me to go try a locksmith the key itself was $4 and $22 for cutting which never happened so I paid for nothing.< /Text>

I had a great experience at Chevy of La Quinta.  I came into the dealership and was looking to possibly trade in my Tahoe.  After working with the internet manager as well as Manny, both employees were the most honest car salesmen I have worked with here in the desert.  They gave me advice on what to look for when purchasing a car as well as suggestions on what to do.  In the end, I kept my Tahoe and they still treated me with respect even thou I didnt purchase a vehicle with them. Very impressive! If you are looking to purchase a Chevy, definitely give them a try :)</text>

Bad service, Slow Service, Terrible communication,  This establishment
talks the talk, but does not walk the walk.  Sadly, there is no leadership rolls in the management.  Whoever owns this company might want to send in an undercover boss to see what EXACTLY is going on.</review>

<Text>Reps do not respect your valuable time. The entire so called team is pretty terrible. How can one drive off with a car after negotiating for 5 hours of my time and 3 weeks later be told. " The deal cannot be done, need to give the car back" Told them from the very beginning not to waste my time. Would not recommend at all... similar experience also happened 2 years ago at the same place as well.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

This place is terrible.  If they can't find the problem, they invent something to say.  They blame the customer.  They overcharge.  Have had my truck in to them 3 times for a problem that Chevrolet admits to (we got a letter) and the STILL have not fixed it.  Done with them forever.<//Review>

But after a few hours, not only did he deliver on his word to get me exactly what I asked for, he also provided me with even more gifts with it than I even imagined. The whole chevy team was friendly and patient and gave me the time to sort what I wanted. I promised that if he got me a good deal I'd recommend.

<Review>I have purchased a car from almost every dealership in the Coachella Valley and this was my first time visiting and dealing with La Quinta Chevrolet. To say that I'm impressed with their customer service would be an understatement. Their professionalism is outstanding, and their curtesy to customers is unparalleled. My salesman, Joshua Bott, was kind and knowledgeable, patient, and most importantly he was not pushy or overbearing. I felt I made an informed decision when I purchased my 2017 Cruze from him just this past weekend. I'm loving my new car and I am a new fan of La Quinta Chevrolet. I will be recommending them indefinitely. Thank you, Josh and LQ Chevrolet team! I'm one happy gal.

Took in my 2012 Sonic for  full diagnostic. Thought there were boost leaks. They tell me my turbo is cracked intetnally, which made sense, these cars have turbo issues. So for close to $2k. They replace that, both cam acuators (even though only one was bad; he didn't tell me he was doing both either) and a water outlet. Car was driven well over 100 miles because 1/4 tank of gas was gone. Not to mention it was reading 33mpg which is only possible if you drive the piss out of it. So I drive to Riverside and on the way back my CEL returns with the same code and my turbo isn't spooling. Get home pop the hood for the first time, yes they installed the new parts, but I notice lots of dangling line that weren't routed correctly. I am fuming!!! I don't spend the money to take my car to the dealer to get ripped off. I have never had a problem in IL, so come on get it together. The only reason you guys get 1 star is because Henry the service writer is a nice guy and helped how he could. I'll be in there today to get this taken care of, because now I'm losing more money becauwe I'm forced to miss work. The techs clearly don't know what they are doing. Once this problem is fixed I will never go to this location for service and probably will never buy another Chevy.<//Text>

<Review>Brought my Chevy 2500 HD into the shop for service. Planning for a trip. Left truck overnight so no rush on getting it done. Picked up truck the next day after receiving a excellent report on truck. Parked in my driveway and noticed oil dripping from oil filter. Then crawled under truck to see what was leaking and discoved that truck was never lubed. Took pictures and called dealship to talk to service manager. Service manager was on another call so I spoke with a lady concerning my problem with services not done, but paid to be done! Took truck to different lube shop to have it inspected and lubed. I have pictures after the service from different lube shop. Very dissatified with this dealership. Wondering how many other customers experience this and don't even know they are not getting what they pay for.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

We turned in our 2011 Black SRX in June 2014 and leased a new 2014 Black SRX.  We are not from the Desert, but were pleased with the price and experience.  However, at the time of the sale we were told that the dealership would "take care of everything" and turn in the Release of Liability form immediately.  Within  a few weeks we started getting notices from "Fastrak" that are old car was running through without paying the proper fees.  We attached the appropriate forms that showed we no longer owned the car and sent it into the proper authorities.  WE HAVE TRIED CALLING SO MANY TIMES TO LA QUINTA CADILLAC AND IT HAS TO BE THE WORST PHONE SERVICE AND SERVICE IN GENERAL.  I am on the phone once again to them and have been transferred five times so far.  We have left messages for the General Manager and he never calls back.  This dealership is horrible.  After receiving 4 more notices of FasTrak violations we went to DMV and refiled the Release of Liability which we would have done ourselves originally.  We think someone there is driving our old car and just wanted to get to the bottom of this problem.  Now the dealership has me on hold again...let's see so far it has been 7 minutes!< /review>
