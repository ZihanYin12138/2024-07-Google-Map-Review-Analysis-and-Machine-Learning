<Review>Best chicken parm I ever had. It was quite moist and pefectly crusted with the right amount of marinara. I asked for extra garlic bread and they gave me a whole to go box full. The interior was definitely a sign of the times but that isn't their fault. When things change I will dine in more often.</Review><user_id>112036133081096825148< /user_id>< Resp>

Heard good things so was kind of disappointed.  Maybe COVID hurt this place?  No dine in still. Got to go and it was okay.  Only one guy working, not sure if he made the food too, he was gone awhile?  Nobody came in there while we were waiting. Kind of made us go hum?  Hope this pandemic didn't hurt this place.  Good luck.</text>< pics>

<Text>I went in because I was craving mashed potatoes. They were out of the pork chops but let me substitute the mashed potatoes with the grilled chicken. The chicken was so dry I had to stop eating it. The only thing that had any flavor was the mashed potatoes and they were kind of runny and the tomatoes that was on the chicken tasted like a came straight from the can and I had to heat up the rolls myself because they were straight from the bag. It was terrible and I'm not going back.</Text>< gmapID>

Thoroughly enjoyed this restaurant. The wait staff were prompt, attentive and helpful. I requested a substitution which they had no problem in doing. The food was excellent and reasonably priced. I would recommend this restaurant and plan on going back.<//text>

<Review>I'm sorry to say not good. I have been in Manteca since 1984. This place has been an Italian restaurant the entire time. We loved it when it was Pietros enjoyed it when it was Dave and Sylvia's. During this time Manteca obtained many more options and the restaurant in the Cardoza Center fell off our radar. We were in the neighborhood looking for a place to eat and decided to give Angelenos a try. We both had pasta dishes Chicken Parmesan for myself Shrimp and scallops Alfredo. The chicken was not pounded and the sauce had no flavor. My dish again flavorless and completely lacked the richness you'd expect from an Alfredo sauce. The decor is exactly the same and was out dated in the early 80s. Our server was attentive enough since we were the only ones in there but he was dressed in Jeans, flannel shirt and a baseball style hat. We probably will not be back.< /Review>< user_id>

<review>The place isn't fancy but the quality of the food is good,  large portions, good prices. Friendly and attentive wait staff.  I tried the eggplant parmesan with meat sauce, was very tasty & my wife had the prawns and scallop with garlic cream sauce special- both were $11.99 and was quite impressed. Came with warm bread and soup or salad for another 2 bucks. They feature local Delicato wines that are good quality and affordable @ around $20 a bottle. Well be back.</review>< pics>

The gluten free rotini was as good as regular pasta.  Disregard any negative reviews and go have the best Italian food in Manteca!! I'd like to throw in a compliment for Daniel.

<Rate>1< /Rate><Review>Take others' advice. There is better food around. Their mozzarella sticks are literally from Costco. I know because I frequently buy the Costco ones. It's the same one as Angeleno's. Also the food does not meet expectations. Honestly, the service was friendly and the place was clean, but ultimately you're coming there for the food, and the food was so awful, I went to McDonald's afterward and it felt like a 5 star meal in comparison.
With that being said, if you're looking for a place to take your secret boyfriend/girlfriend, angelano's is your place. The lighting is dim and you can barely see anything. It's perfect for secrets</Review><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None< /response>< GmapID>

I ordered spaghetti with meat sauce and a slice of walnut cake.  Both were fantastic. With my take out they also included some bread that was very good.  It would have been better had they put in some butter, but aside from that, I would order from Angelano's the next time I find myself in Manteca.<//text>

First it took 15 mins to offer something to drink, then it took 30 mins for someone to bother and take my order, 25 mins later food shows up. I had clamchowder soup and chicken Alfredo, soup was horrible, saw no clams, potatoes or anything, seemed like a cheap can soup. Pasta was bland, just alfreado sauce, pasta, chicken and Parmesan cheese, nothing special, guess I was expecting something better, wife had chicken Sherry, it was OK, give it a 6 out of 10. My kid had meatball pasta, it was OK. Besides the food being below acceptable and slow service, the decor is outdated. The only positive comment is the prices are very low, but guess you get what you pay for. I was so disappointed, it ruined my night. Olive garden seems 5 star after this place.< /text>< Rate>

<username>Carrie Harris< /username><Text>Absolutely the best customer service and SUPER YUMMY food!!! This past weekend my son's 3rd party was scheduled to be at a local park, because of weather we were forced to move the party indoors. I already had 60 RSVP's so I didn’t want to have it in my home. Angelano's allowed us to use their private room, catered the event and their customer service is impeccable!!!! I was so impressed, they are very thoughtful, they arranged the room so there was enough room to move around, room to play games, they allowed us to decorate and were thoroughly accommodating. The food???? OMG the food was sooooooooo good! The put out a yummy salad bar so everyone could pick what they wanted on their salad (perfect for little ones), I had suggested spaghetti with meat sauce and fettuccini Alfredo for the pastas and the owner made penne with meat sauce and spirals with alfredo and chicken (MUCH better for little ones) AND he surprised us and made some mac and cheese too!!!! Their bread was AMAZING and I was just so impressed overall. I will definitely be back for their food, I'm a foodie, I LOVE FOOD and it takes a lot to impress me. Their food was fresh, flavorful and delicious.  I heard they make a mean burger too. If you are having a party in Manteca / Lathrop / Ripon check out Angelano's!!!! They will put together a menu that is affordable (surprisingly). Thank you Angelano's you have a fan for life!</Text>< pics>

Very reliable, quick, amazing Doctors and staff. super helpful and professional. Thanks for quickly getting us in and fixing my daughter’s ingrown toenails immediately. She’s already almost fully recovered after a few days and finally back on her toes. Wish I would have found you guys sooner. Thanks so much.😀<//review>

This was only my first appointment with Dr. Nejat, but I was impressed.  I felt very comfortable and well taken care.  His staff is also very friendly and efficient! I think it's important to connect to your heath care givers and this was easy at Podiatry Institute of Southern California!</Review>

I was really impressed with Dr. Nejat. He is really personable and welcomed all of my questions. He also explains things very clearly and doesn't try and talk above you using words that you don't understand. It's and old school doctor feel with a new age experience.  His staff is super nice and very helpful. I am telling everyone about him!  Thank you so much!!!<//text>

<Review>Dr. Negat is an extremely personable and knowledgeable physician.  My experience as a patient was wonderful in every way. Making an appointment was extremely easy, and his office is very clean and organized. As a Registered Nurse of many years, I can definitely recognize excellence when I see it in a physician, and Dr. Negat is top notch. I highly recommend him if you are looking for a podiatrist.</Review>< username>

<review>Dr. Nejat is a healer!  Incredibly warm and professional. He tells you exactly what he is going to do to fix you and then he does it. He has now fixed 4 feet in our family and I find myself looking forward to my next foot problem just to be healed again. Wonderful service and I can’t recommend highly enough.< /review>< Pics>

I had a great visit with Dr. Nejat! I arrived to my appointment a little early and was taken back to the exam room right away. The gentlemen at the front desk was welcoming and efficient. Dr. Nejat did an excellent job treating my severe in grown toenail. It was quick and nearly painless. He was also very nice and fun to converse with. I will definitely go to Dr. Nejat for all my podiatry needs!</text>

I've seen Dr. Nejat for eight years. During the last visit he aired his crackpot conspiracy theories about the president and vice-president while using a scalpel on my foot. I keep hoping there are still situations uninvaded by politics, and keep getting disappointed.<//review>

<text>Dr. Nejat explained my issue in layman’s terms. He visually showed me the source of my foot pain in a 3D image on a monitor. He took a 3D image of my foot to create custom insoles for my shoes. Years ago I had to have molds made of my feet for this purpose. The visit was quick and most, importantly, safe in regards to COVID precautions.<//text><pics>None< /pics><resp>{'time': 1598466005122, 'text': 'Thank you for the very kind review'}</resp><gmapID>0x80c2ba2945cab263:0x22fc722569b3e035</gmapID></record>

<Review>Dr. Nejat is an excellent doctor. What I like about him is how calm and patient he is. He helped me with multiple issues, and he did not seem to my mind that I had multiple questions to ask. For example, I had lots of questions about different shoes that were bothering my arch, and he patiently looked at the arch supports for many different pairs of shoes. Even though he had a lot of patients present, he did not rush me at all. He made small adjustments to orthotics for me that have been helpful. He is sort of like a craftsman in that regard. Very talented with his hands. He has helped me for the last 2 years with various foot issues. Every time the experience is the same. Friendly front office staff, amazing doctor, better foot care. I have nothing but praise for him. He is an old fashioned doctor wrapped up into a young friendly shell :) I happily drive far to see him.<//Review><user>117910228866612038162<//user><username>Leo Treyzon</username><Response>{'time': 1571331017559, 'text': 'Thank you so much for the very kind review.

< Review>
Dr Nejat and his staff are wonderful!
I injured my foot while out of the country and he made time to see me
at the last minute on a Friday.
He is very kind, thorough and attentive and answered and explained  all of my questions.
He has a lovely comforting sense of humor and is a most attentive Doctor  who will also respond
very quickly to,any phone questions.
Thank you Dr Nejat!
I highly recommend this Doctor.</Review>

It's hard to trust a review for any medical professional but I'm a Dentist myself.  Dr. Nejat is a guy that's very aware, generally well informed about everything and seems to be a knowledge seeker.  He didn't stop learning after residency.  Furthermore, he has built a network of care providers including pharmacies and other auxiliary services to manage the cost of care and give the patient the best experience he can control.  If you need a podiatrist, this is really the guy or at least type of guy you want to see.  Dr. Nejat is an extremely knowledgeable professional.< /text>

<Text>After a year of suffering from discomfort from (what I thought was) a tiny object embedded in my sole, I decided to take action. Impressed by Dr. Nejat's Yelp reviews, I thought I would give his office a call.  Turns out what I had was a seed corn, which he promptly removed.

He also gave me a regimen for athlete's foot (which I didn't know I had) and for toenail fungus. I was impressed that he took the time to write out the six steps I needed to take, and at how much time he spent with me, patiently answering all my questions. When the medications he recommended proved too expensive for me (being without insurance), he prescribed alternatives.

For foot problems, I would  definitely call Dr. Nejat again!</Text></record>

< review>
A foot doctor I'd like to hang out with! Dr Nejat was super professional and had a great personality at the same time. Dude knows what he's doing. Highly recommend. I came in with a pain thats been happening for a few months and he knew exactly what it was within less than a minute. Go see him if you have any pains whatsoever in your feet! 😄< /review>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Text>Dr.Nejat and his staff are wonderful! I called and was able to obtain a new pt. appointment very quickly.When I arrived at the office, I was greeted right away and with respect. The intake process was fairly easy although the device used to in-put personal data was a bit awkward to use.The office is clean and bright,and I got the sense that the staff is very efficient.They were very pleasant which leads me to believe that it is a good work environment;this certainly makes for better patient care.I did not have to wait long to see Dr.Nejat; he is very pleasant,respectful and answered my numerous questions,while doing a thorough exam.He confirmed what I thought I was experiencing (i.e.plantar fasciitis in both feet),and provided a detailed treatment plan that did not include a steroid injection,which I would have refused anyway.I have been implementing his plan for the past 6 days and although I have not been on my feet as much as I had been previously(he told me I needed shoes with better arch support,which I have yet to buy),I feel about 90% better.Also,much more hopeful.The only thing I regret is not going sooner to see Dr.Nejat.Thank you,Dr.Nejat and staff!< /Text>< pics>

<text>Dr. Nejat was very kind and seems to be extremely knowledgable about the issues I could be experiencing. He played no guessing games and immediately issued blood work and an MRI to get to the real root of the issue. So far so good. Quite happy I found him on Yelp.</text>< pics>

What a life saver!!  My grandmother was visiting from out of town and required immediate care today. Dr. Nejat and staff were so professional, accommodating and friendly and took us in on a last-minute, end-of-day, end-of workweek, Friday afternoon appointment! G'ma is now at 100% and ready to enjoy her weekend at the beach before heading back to Iowa! Thanks again Dr. Nejat!</review>

<userid>106492645185947610764< /userid><Text>So, for years, I have been dealing with drop foot and a callus, or what I thought was a "tailor's" bunion, that had moved in under the pad of my small toe. Every step I took felt like I was stepping on a sharp object. Custom insoles, orthotics, pain medications, lotions and creams provided some relief, but the pain always returned within a day or two - sometimes within hours. Now, sixteen weeks after back surgery to address my drop foot, my gait has improved along with the redistribution of weight towards my big toe. However, the pain under my small toe pad has remained. That was until I saw Dr. Hejat. After a Q&A consult, he took a look at my foot and quickly identified a thickened callus that was the cause of my pain. After gently removing it, he moved on to my shoe insole. He noticed I was using a "ball of foot" gel pad as a cushion and quickly cut a pressure-free relief zone out of the gel pad before reinserting the insole into my shoe. After putting my shoes back on I took a few steps and was completely pain free! No surgery, no injections, and no up sale or talk of needing custom orthotics or insoles. From beginning to end, check-in to walk-out, a great experience and an even better result!</Text>< Response>

Dr. Nejat performed Lapiplastic bunion surgery on my foot. The proceedure was very successful. I had very little pain, and my bunion has been corrected. Most importantly, I have never had a Doctor give better care than Dr. Nejat. He answered phone call and questions. He and his staff wen above and beyond to help me.</Text>

< review>
If I could give 10 stars I would. Dr. Nejat is the ONLY and BEST Podiatrist to go to. When my plantar fasciitis was becoming unbearable my Primary Care Physician referred me to a different Podiatrist. After a few weeks of short and unsuccessful treatments the Podiatrist that my PCP referred me to told me to "tough out the pain". That's when I knew I had to get second opinion. I was looking up Best Podiatrists and I came across the excellent reviews from Dr. Nejat's Patients . I am so grateful for the online reviews because it helped me find a Doctor that will give the best treatment and care.
Dr. Nejat never told me to "tough out my pain" and treated me with utmost respect, care and professionalism. Dr. Nejat took the time to listen to all my concerns. He went in depth discussing my condition and picked up on other factors that I was not aware of. This means that he is top notch and very knowledgeable in his profession. The other Podiatrist that I went to did not discuss not even half of what was going on with me and treatments that was best for me compared to Dr. Nejat .
Thank You for listening to me and for your excellent care</review>

It needs to be updated and health inspected and they help the homeless but the facilities are run down and had bed bugs. I went to get free meal and to stay overnight which was helpful during this pandemic of covid-19. The people are nice and one woman kept bothering me about using my phone in church when I was using it to read the Bible. She kept bothering me about it so I had to change the row I was sitting in.</review>< pictures>

When donations come so do two women with a van or truck and start taking all the Good food and leave the week old donuts brown bananas . The church let's it go on.
If I have said anything that is not so I'm sorry and I apologise and see for yourself. Don't let one of the three stooges be there they retaliate sheep don't talk. This is my my opinion<//text>< Pictures>

You can't expect perfect service from a place who is serving, loving and providing for the least of these. This church allows hurting people to work and serve there so of course you may come across someone who is rude or unprofessional. They are learning how to serve and be responsible. The church is giving them a chance. People aren't perfect. This church is doing more than most churches out there. I was so impressed with how they don't use their donations to make the place look good and instead they invest in the people which many churches could learn from. We were treated with care when I took a mom and kids I met escaping from a bad situation. Very welcoming. Food and a warm place to lay! I'm very thankful for the work this church does!< /Review>

And if you do not show up, you are out. I think maybe, just maybe prayers and meditation might do the job much better. I WONDER how many people got fired or were kicked out from this nonsense. I know one Catholic homeless person that never went back. She now sleeps in her car. SAD.< /text></record>

<user_name>Debbie Alvarez< /user_name><text>The head pastor is like a lion but really is a nice man who just wants to run a tight ship and keep people from disrupting the overall wellbeing of both church and refuge for tbe homeless keeping a balance by his ruff tuff persona  perhaps he's  just keeping the peace in the sanctuary because im sure people can not keep quiet during service and needed to be reminded to be quite during service which should be taken serious a place of worship. And i double children are being taken away due to any fault of the church.  People shouldn't say things like that if they do not have all the facts or listen to gossip or hearsay THERE IS ALWAYS TWO SIDES TO EVERYTHING!!!   People SHOULD never assume and g o around making accusation so lightly or especially so publicly with no real merit ...

Okay i said my piece ...

I had a good experience volunteering here..
.thank God for this place and the man who runs it!!!

Keep up the good work you do for the community and those who need this place ..<//text>< Response>

The food served here is home cooked by Brenda the kitchen manager.
There are beds available for Men ,women and a few for families.
The requirements are only that you attend church services 3 timed a week , abide by the 9 pm curfew(10 pm on friday and saturday) and that you help yourself find a job during the work week.

<review>Wiley Drake is an embarrassment to all Christians especially Baptists, he's an embarrassment to God's children of other religious traditions, and he's an embarrassment to the human family. He is what Jesus called a wolf in sheep's clothing- one who is outwardly innocent yet deadly within. He reduces the one, holy, living, and loving God of all people and turns God into a tribal deity aligned with his own prejudices and insecurities. He claims to love God and yet hates a sister or brother. He distorts the Biblical narrative to accommodate his overblown ego and interests. He doesn't acknowledge the clarion call of the prophets to  "do justice, love mercy and walk humbly with God", to "let justice roll down like waters and righteousness like an ever flowing stream"  It disturbs me that a clergy of any religious tradition would misuse their pulpit and status to pray for the death of anyone. I pray that Almighty God will cleanse Wiley Drake of his hatred, and injustice, that he will begin to see the divine spark in all God's children, and to become a co-creator with God in transforming the human race into the human family, of realizing the Kingdom of God in our midst- the reign of justice and inclusion, where God's love and compassion prevails, where no one is a stranger, where all are welcomed at the heavenly feast. Father, forgive him, for he doesn't know what he does.< /review>< Pics>

<Review>Course needs more work to be done but I enjoy playing Golf there. They also had a great burger, fries and a beer for $10.00 deals that was before the Pandemic of Covid-19. 😔  I still play there a lot with friends and family.

<Review>Not sure what to call this place but a golf course is not appropriate. The greens resemble the landscape of moon with deep craters that make your ball bounce all directions. The carts have so so little charge they have to be pushed up hills which is dangerous and annonying. The coup de gras was the pin stuck in fairway of hole 12, the green was so bad they shoved the flag into an arbitrary area making the hole the wrong distance and unplayable. Speaking of distance, good luck finding a marker..you will find yourself guessing distance on nearly every shot.
We were terrified crossing the bridges on this course for fear of death and dismemberment. If you are hurt clearly there isn't enough money to cover your injuries. God forbid you might even become the owner!

Play at your own risk...</Review>< Pics>

<Text>I’m sorry to say that this course is in very bad shape. Apparently the owner doesn’t even golf so he doesn’t understand what it takes to manage a golf course. Has a lot of potential! It would be much more worth it at $20 not $65. Hopefully they can turn it around but until then this course should not be played.</Text>< username>

It was a nice pitch & put course.  In a pinch it worked out perfect.  We did a leisurely 18 in 3 hours. They are all par 3. But remember there is in par 3 at 175 yards.  Bring a 3 or 5 wood.</review>

This is a fairly run of the mill course. I found the fairways to be in decent shape, but the greens were pretty beat up. The traps were well manicured, but the sand was rather hard. It’s a pretty long course, but not overly challenging. The facilities - bathrooms and such - are pretty beat up. That said, I only paid  $25 and I finished in about 3 hours. Staff is friendly though. Below average course, but great value.< /text>

Don't listen to these drama queens posting reviews. The course is great! Yes there are a few holes, especially 12 that have greens in rough shape. Very long course with some great challenges. Overall I was worried after my buddy booked us here and reading the reviews. Just be prepared for a few greens in need of some work. Cost us $55 for cart and 18. Decent rate for San Diego.  Overall awesome experience. We will be back. Thank you Castle Creek for a great Sunday.< /review>

<review>Greens are not playable. Chipping is the best route to the hole, even from on the green in most cases. It’s not worth $56, and I think they charge even more if you don’t get a GolfNow deal. It’s just a sad place. I imagine it was nice at one time, but is suffering severely from neglect right now.< /review>< pics>

Bummer conditions especially for the price.  $55 bucks when it was worth about $25.  Went because me and my bro use to head there together back when we first started playing.  Pro shop was in bad shape, starter, couldn’t remember our names after asking 3 times, fairways were bad, around the fairways forget it, greens ok, and finished it off with the cart guy asking me to move the cart I returned about two more feet over.  Seems to be on the closing end of its run.  Unless this is all covid related...sorry for the bad review but people got to know it isn’t worth it.<//text>

The greens were in poor condition and the fairways were dry and thin.  The bummer is that they knew of the conditions and still charged full price.

Had a great time on this course the fairways were a little brown but the greens are getting worked on, the plus side it wasn't packed with golfer so we weren't rushed on our game. I had a good time and will come again and play some more golf here. Ps so far this is the only golf place that was iced water around the course witch is awesome because its vary refreshing!</review>

DO NOT PLAY HERE!!! I can’t stress it enough. This place hasn’t been mowed in months. There’s craters all of the greens. The guy at the front desk was very rude. We asked for our money back after the first two holes. It was $60 and it wasn’t worth $10! We should have had our entire money refunded and they would only refund half.

<text>Course is in very bad shape. Fairways are extremely unkempt. The greens are in terrible condition with bald spots everywhere. Tee boxes were uneven and gouged. This course needs to fix itself if it wants to justify $40 a round. You couldn't pay me to play here again.

Additionally the front desk clerk could care less about the customer. Barely acknowledged my existence and quickly went back to playing on the computer. All the course bathrooms are closed and the one that is open at the main building is absolutely filthy.<//text></record>

For the price very disappointed. Was my first and last time playing here. Plenty of other amazing courses for around $50 in north county. Greens where the only green part of the course and where in bad shape ball bounces all over the place. Fairways had some ok spots mostly dead grass. Hate to say it as I almost never write bad reviews but spend your money elsewhere.< /Review>

<Time>1592863918269<//Time><Pics>None<//Pics><review>This has always been about the worst kept golf course in the area, but the the prices were affordable.  Now, since coming out of the lockdown, the course is in even worse shape than ever and they are asking $45 a round with no 9 hole rate.  No one is going to pay that to play at Castle Creek.  That is the green fee at Pala Mesa which is a world apart from Castle Creek.  Only explanation is that they are intentionally putting themselves out of business.  And another North County golf course bites the dust.< /review><gmap_id>0x80db89b739d910d7:0xc3df2f566536b807< /gmap_id></record>

<Review>Only green grass on greens. Even the greens have very little green grass. No sand in bunkers, only dirt. Cheap price reflects playing conditions. They need to update their photos on their website. They also gave us a cart that died during our round. On the positive side, the burger and fries were delicious.</Review>< Pics>

10 greens were under water. It’s a pathetic excuse of a golf course. I’ve played courses in the heart of Detroit that had wild pitbulls lurking around that I would recommend over Caste Creek in Escondido. I wouldn’t play here again if management paid me 50 dollars to do so.

<user_name>John Murphy< /user_name><Pictures>None</Pictures><review>Pros: wonderful young lady in pro-shop on Sat. 3.24! Great price $35 Sr rate. Great food special for lunch: pint of beer, loaded cheese burger & fries for $10 + tax & tip.
Cons: greens are beyond damaged with loss of cover and disease. Fairways not too much better.
Overall know what you’re getting for your $ and don’t be disappointed 😀< /review><Response>{'time': 1522103984702, 'text': "John,\n\nThank you for your review!

<Review>I come here often with coworkers since it's just down the street from work but there is a girl here by the name of Olivia and she decided that she would serve everybody at the table but me. The only thing I could honestly think of is that I'm a nice pretty girl and some how that may of offended her. After finally receiving a drink I realized it had nothing but water in it and asked if she could top me up. She refused and turned her back. The next time I came in I was told that because I did not tip for this outstanding service she refuses to serve me because I did not tip. I have worked in the hospitality industry and fully understand that they work for tips. But it's also understood that in order to make good tips you must give good service. She gave me the card to her manager Leeann and when I called her I was told that legally she can refuse service to whoever she wants. I told her that I hadn't done anything to deserve this and the manager informed me she would give her a call. I then was able to purchase a drink but only after making me wait 10 min. She slid me my drink and said "give me your card!" Never have I been treated so badly in an establishment. In combination with the staff and how the manager treated me on the phone I would not recommend this place to anyone. On top of everything it's in very poor condition.  I will also be reporting this discrimination to the BBB and will no longer be bringing my business here.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None<//response><GmapID>0x80db89b739d910d7:0xc3df2f566536b807<//GmapID></record>

Course was in excellent condition, even in the middle of summer. Read some negative reviews in the past but we had a great time golfing here. Staff was friendly, newer carts, course in great shape, highly recommended. Was a little busy at 8 am on Saturday morning but pace of play was good. Course looked to be wide open after 10 am.</text>

<text>course was challenging, but very fun. mature trees and tight fairways on some holes make for a very enjoyable round of golf. good conditions considering the drought and greens were nice and smooth. rex was very helpful and greeted me with enthusiasm. would recommend this course to anyone and cant wait to come back and play again.<//text><Pics>None<//Pics>< GmapID>

<review>Made for a great Monday afternoon golfing trip. They offer military and senior rates so the price is doable if you don't want to have to pay too much for a solid round of golf. Employees are cool, they'll get you out as soon as possible. The greens were in good condition, not too fast and not too slow. Some holes were more difficult than others but it was still a great place for any level golfer. On top of all this, I got one of the best hotdogs I've had from their snack bar.< /review><name>Alex Sidney< /name><GmapID>0x80db89b739d910d7:0xc3df2f566536b807</GmapID>< Pics>

Course seems a little rough. High grass, greens look bad. I understand this is under new management. This is great. The layout of the course appears that at one time, this was a great course.</text>

This place is not as advertised. Not a championship golf course. The only green that wasn't rashed up was the 1 visible from the main intersection. There is no real discernable difference between the fairway and the ruff. Its ruff all over... The grounds keeper was 1/2  a hole ahead of us watering all the greens in the middle of the day. We will never be back. I wish I could post the pictures I took.< /review>

<Text>Disappointed and angry at how far this course has fallen in the last decade. Greens were TORE UP, fairways were over watered/ inconsistent cut (cut like rough). Dead grass spots everywhere. Facilities looked run down... besides the greens being so messed up, if you have a clear shot through chunks of grass missing they rolled out nice.</Text><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

<userid>104917798203340905639</userid><review>They're rolls were very delectable! They had a unique flavoring. I had the rising sun roll, it had citrus flavoring that mixed well with the raw salmon on top, the fried salmon in middle brought a fulfilling wholesome end to the tail of the flavoring that brought it all together. My date had the ultimate shrimp with crab but held the spice. Also a very delectable roll, the sauces on top were sweet with just a little bit of tang that created explosion of flavors on the palette with the fried shrimp. It was the best of all worlds! The service was very prompt and friendly. The whole staff were very friendly in fact. The reasutrant was downtown in a beautiful area with nice shops and saloons adorned by trees with lights strung about. Parking was easy during the holiday season, shouldn't be a problem the rest of the time.<//review></record>

<review>My family and I love this place!! This restaurant is newly opened so we decided to give it a try. They had a variety of sushi, soup, and desserts!
Once we were finished, the waitresses were extremely kind and gifted my family a complimentary waffle as dessert! Amazing place, would definitely recommend!</review></record>

UMAI Sushi fish is not fresh enough for sashimi purpose. The fish itself is also too thick. Only upside is it is a bit cheaper<//review>

Terrible experience. Their hours online said they were open. Their hours on their door said they were open. There was a customer eating in front of their restaurant. We stood there waiting to be served. After saying hello, the chef went to check down the alleyway and came back saying they’re closed. Later when we walk past there’s another customer seated on a table.</Review>

Mervyn's bar is awesome. At first it seems like a 'hole in the wall' *I mean, it is* but the crowd is great and the music is awesome, especially considering you can choose it through the AMI app.< /Text>< pics>

The tempura was pretty bad. The vegetable ones are not crispy at all, and the coating tastes just like bread. The shrimp ones have totally different coating, and I think they are not entirely made by the restaurant, more like purchased. I noticed the table next to us left over a lot of tempura as well. They provided some free dessert at the end though.< /text>

Amazing, high end and not expensive.
Highly recommended.
The grilled whole squid (ika) is great,
Both nigiri and sashimi combinations are chef's choice, and excellent.
I'd recommend the salmon, tuna, hirame, yellow tail and albacore.<//Review>

<Rating>2<//Rating><Review>Take out order. Fish was not fresh, was mushy and mealy. Tuna/jalapeño dish was not executed well, the “shavings” of pepper were actually thick slices of pepper, way too overpowering for sushi. I cannot have wasabi, so I specifically said no wasabi but they packed the ginger in a tiny cup WITH wasabi, so I could not eat it. Still can’t get over how much better the sushi (the actual fish) is at home in land-locked Colorado than this was. Fish was mushy and mealy, gently squeeze it between your fingers and it disintegrated, and the flavor just wasn’t there either... so disappointed.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None</resp>< GmapID>

<Text>Good karaoke ruined by rude bar staff who were complicit and possibly actually assisting a patron trying to steal my backpack. I caught the thief before he left premises. Bar waitress refused to call 911 and says perp was her "friend and a regular patron"  and "he would not do that". I persisted and said I will call 911 myself. She then called the manager who came from out back and played us back surveillance video that proved the thief deliberately stole my bag.   Glad I was keeping an eye on my bag and didn't lose anything. This bar not only looks like a criminal den, it is one.</Text>< pictures>

My favorite bar in Mountain View, been about 10 times, we always do vodka with grapefruit.
Service is super fast,
it's quiet so you can talk without shouting.
Bonus points for bar having a soft edge, so it's comfy to put hands on.<//review>

Great Dive Bar, yet it's a crapshoot as to how much drinks will be,
1st round $7.oo each
2nd & 3rd round $6.oo each and Stronger!

This place used to be cool, before they added the lame bar in the front. Now they encourage you to buy an over priced draft beer in a setting that's sterile and far from "hip". If you want a decent beer, go to the beer garden down the street.<//Text>

One of the last bastions of Old Mountain View. Happy to see this place hasn't changed much, if at all, over the years.</text>

You like dive bars because they don't have much selection, it smells funny, people leave you alone, and - best of all - there aren't a lot of people to begin with. So if you rate it highly for being all those things... but it's not good to smell funny or have poor selection. And if you rate it highly, too many people go. So.... 3 stars. It's a dive.</Text><Name>Brian Bulkowski</Name>< Time>

Don't get me wrong I love dive bars, but they could update this place in a major way. Layout is stupid, no tvs for sports, all furniture is old and rude employees is the norm.</Text>

The back room at Mervyn's is basically a dive bar. Nothing more, nothing less... This is not something you'd expect to find in downtown Mountain View.</review>

It's a dive bar for locals. Don't expect anything but that, and you'll have fun. Expect a booth, any mixed drink, some level of respect or service, and you're gonna have a bad time.< /Review>

We stopped here during our self guided hike tour & the customer service was amazing! My favourite part was the wine tasting at the tasting bar which was just $10 for 5 different wines! I also loved my salted caramel with nuts ice cream. Very rich & appropriate after a long bike ride. The only downside was my spinach ravioli. There was barely any seasoning or flavouring. We went here on a Saturday afternoon and it wasn’t even packed. Made it the perfect pit stop. We ended up covering it in pepper to make it taste better. Other than the ravioli, everything was great!<//Review>

The offerings of this store are awesome, the coffee is top notch. The wine shop has a great selection of local wines. Everytime I go there they have a great selection of gifts & unique items. I love the greeting cards they have as well, very dry humor. The last time I was getting coffee, the young lady making my coffee was so friendly & genuine her name was Hannah. Another great thing to get there are their sandwiches & a great drink selection. I can't wait to see what they have on my next visit...❤❤❤❤<//review>

<rating>5< /rating><Text>A cute little deli/market whose defining characteristics are great espresso from Flying Goat Coffee and a wine tasting bar/shop with a curated selection of imported wine that you won't find anywhere else in Sonoma. It's slightly off of the beaten path, and a great stop on the way to wineries in the northeast part of town.<//Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOvBiauKAbiK5Rut0gJgWAKKaXFF8PmknqfMppN=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics>< resp>

<rate>5</rate><review>As someone trying to learn more about wine, I can't say enough good things about Todd Jolly and his Tasting Society platform. His wine selections are fantastic and the notes he provides for each bottle are invaluable. It is clear that Todd takes the time to carefully review and select bottles, rather than simply throwing random bottles together. If someone wants to enjoy the best wines in Sonoma and from the Old World, I would highly recommend getting in touch with Todd.<//review>< Pictures>

My wife and I stayed here for three nights in cottage number four. The cottage is very comfortable. Bed was comfy. Excellent kitchenette and some nice goodies to welcome you. The place is well located near Sonoma. We'd definitely recommend it.< /Text>

I like this place. You can get coffee and sandwiches. There is wine tasting for a very reasonable $10 for 5 wines. You can also get good large draft beers for a very reasonable price. Enjoy.<//text>

<review>We prefer Sonoma’s Best Wine Club to any single vineyard because of the amazing selection of thoughtfully-curated local and international wines. The tasting room is more like a bar (you can get a full pour versus tiny taste) with friendly, laid-back atmosphere filled with fun, interesting locals. The adjacent cafe is also delicious. All of the staff is great—shout out to Todd, Myron, and Joanne for always making us feel welcome.< /review>< Response>

The gift shop is interestingly good, I check prices of anything that appeals to me and I always find something that is priced very low for it's value, the rest medium to high.<//Text>

If you are looking for artesian products, most locally made, with a cool comfortable vibe, then stop here.

It’s perfect for a picnic, to get your rations, from cheeses, meats, spreads, crackers, to a bakery, espresso, to a deli for salads, sandwiches and drinks. They offer a large selection of unique wines as well.<//Review>

This was the cutest one stop shop. Deli, ice cream/ gelato parlor, small wine tasting room and Espresso Bar all in one. It's has a little but of everything. Will definitely make it a place to stop on all my trips to wine country.<//Text>

<Text>Only came here for the food. Some of the things we're obviously microwaved frozen foods that were quickly prepared. Sandwiches that were made seemed like an afterthought. Lines weren't particularly long, but was very slow, followed by an even slower wait to actually get the food to your table. Can't speak to the stay and rooms, but I would not recommend the food.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

For locals, the main reason to stop here was the coffee. Sadly, the quality has plummeted lately. Not sure why. My last cup tasted like a barbecue grill.  Won't be back.< /Text>

<review>I was quite disappointed with the service here.  We ordered sandwiches to go and it took about an hour to get our food because they mixed up the order of the tickets.  We noticed that all the parties who came in after us were happily enjoying their meals and we asked when our order was going to be ready and they responded "yours is next" without even checking our ticket.  We proceeded to wait and then inquired another time about our orders and they finally started making them (after waiting almost an hour).  When we addressed the wait time with them, they didn't apologize - the server who took our order actually rolled her eyes at us.  The sandwiches were delicious but I don't think I would return based on the wait time.  We actually missed a scheduled wine tasting because we were waiting for so long and the sandwiches were quite expensive.  They were tasty, but there are plenty of places who will make a delicious sandwich in less time and with better customer service.<//review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

Cozy, but vibrant. Wine tasting with sports on the teli ( you can also enjoy a beer). Wonderful little deli with cold salads a wide of cold drinks to accommodate most tastes. For me I had the Sonoma Veggie sandwich ( see pic). They also have a full coffee bar. Located at East Napa st & Eight St just a bit outside the town square. Friendly staff full of energy and smiles.

Indoor & outdoor seating
Services animals allowed
Handicapped accessible
There is a ramp to the outside patio as well as seating at the bar for wine tasting.
WIFI

You can sit in comfort enjoy great wine, feed your soul with good conversation and take care of that rumbling tummy. You feel like your visiting old friends.< /text>

Perfect place to stay in Sonoma. Cottage with a kitchen, a store with breakfast and picnic fair out front for the day, and a "locals favorite" wine bar in the afternoon to get the lay of the land and have the perfect happy hour.  The manager, Todd, had An amazing selection of wines from the region and the world. All within walking distance of downtown Sonoma.</Review>

<Review>Just stopped in for an Americano. Barista asked if I wanted room for cream. I asked for room for cool water instead. She put the water in for me and it was perfect, not too hot and not too cool. Awesome tasting coffee as well. We now have a new pit stop and place to stay. Deli looked delish as well.</Review>< Pictures>

Great little lunch spot while you're wine tasting in Sonoma. If the weather is nice, take advantage of the adorable picnic tables out back. Makes for a beautiful, relaxing meal.< /Text>

Our server was very friendly and generous, and a great deal to try 6 wines for $6. Paninis were also delicious at the deli, especially the prosciutto mozzarella panini for $10.< /Review>

Smoked pork bbq special was incredibly tender; sauce was excellent too. Nice little touches like horseradish in the cole slaw and mustard seeds in the cabbage. They also have a la carte, olive oil tasting, cheese samples, wine, and they sell art. Lots of friendly people inside, both customers and workers. Will definitely be back.< /Review>

Long time community resource, now under private management.  Like many community pools, this is primarily used by Palo Alto residents, but is open to all (residents get a modest discount for some, but not all usage).

This is also the largest site for one of the bigger age group competitive swim clubs, Palo Alto Stanford Aquatics, who use the 25 yard pool year round for practices for enrolled athletes from 5-6 year olds, all the way to college swimmers on break, and the occasional professional swimmer.

The pool is nestled in Rinconada Park, a sparsely developed space in the heard of residential Palo Alto.  Consisting mostly of open space, tennis courts, a newly built fire station, and the local public elementary school, this is always a pleasant area top stop by.

There is also a substantial community center and library on either side of the park, so anyone that lives locally is likely to visit this location for a variety of purposes, and having the pool here just gives you another reason to treat yourself to a little pool time.< /Text>

Came here on a sunday evening when the pool was pretty full. As soon as I got there I noticed there was NO toilet paper in any of the stalls in the women's bathroom and notified the front desk. 2 hours later, when I come back still no toilet paper. Went to the front desk and the guy in charge says they don't know where toilet paper is or have the ability to change it! I told him too look for it and that I would place it in the stall myself. 5 min later he gives me a bunch of rolls and "thanks" me for doing his job. Will never come back. The folks who run the place clearly didn't care.<//text>

Nice pool, especially for toddlers. Its pretty popular in the summer. Not much sitting space (shady spots fill up quick), needs more grassy area. But still, a lot of fun for little ones + parents.<//Text>

<Rate>4< /Rate><text>Downside: The hours are a bit limited and lines at the moment it enters are a bit long. Upside: this place is great for young kids. The wading pool is large and has a max of 3 feet so 5 year olds can easily roam around before they swim. The fountain at 1.5 feet is wonderful for toddlers. There's also a slide that works for toddlers through elementary school.

Note also there are small lockers outside changing rooms that are free.< /text>< pictures>

< review>
Pool itself is OK, but there're some very rude people.
I was there on a cold Thursday night, and when I began swimming, an old woman said she rented nearly all the lanes except 3, if I continue swimming here I need to pay her extra $10. I was shocked about that because it was not mentioned by the frontdesk or the website. I asked her why and she refused to talk, just kept on shouting "get out" to me. Eventually I had to get out of water in the cold weather, though most lanes were empty I can only swim in 3 of the lanes, which were crowded.
I don't know if the woman belongs to the facility, if she is, it's unfair to charge us without notifying us when we pay at frontdesk. If she's not, please abandon her from the pool, she has curly hair and blue down jacket that day. Extremely rude.
I won't come again but anyone first time coming to this pool please be aware of her.</review>

Visiting from London! Have to say this outdoor pool is fantastic. I was expecting the pool to be chilled but it was warm and pleasant. I really wish we had something to this standard in London. I'd love to use this morw often and shall certainly be coming back when in town. The showers are good with a large changing room. I swam fairly late in evening so the toilets were a little messy but on the whole it was a pleasure to swim in.< /text>

Palo Alto Swim and Sport at Rinconada Pool is proud to be one of the few full functioning public facilities that offers a wide range of aquatic recreation, conditioning and instruction in our area.  Our goal is to serve as many community members as we possibly can in a very safe manner.  As the summer progresses and our youthful workforce expands we will be able to serve more aquatic enthusiasts.  We are currently limited in the number of people we can serve at a time and stay within safe lifeguarding ratios.  We are currently very busy and have been for months, recruiting, certifying and training safety staff and we look forward to meeting the high demand at the wonderful Rinconada Aquatic facility.'}<//Response>

Terrrible. I recommend this pool for people who like to stand outside in the sun for 2 and a half hours. They staff is horrible, they keep everyone waiting outside and only let a few people every 20 or 15 minutes so. Best place to swim worst place to go.

Alright so I promise myself I wouldn’t return by some how I ended up swimming here with my family, I added two starts because this time there was no line, and someone was taking cash from outside the door and the deep end of the pool was empty so it was pretty much to myself👌, just wish the diving board would be open longer.< /Review>

The facility is nice but when it’s at capacity they just close it for hours on end instead of doing a ‘one-in-one out’ which would actually keep the line moving. Ridiculous and lazy. Who manages this?!</Text>

Love this pool for lap swimming because there are about 13 lanes so you rarely need to split lanes or circle swim.
Bring your own towel, but you can use the buoys and kickboards provided onsite.<//text>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Review>I swim here with the Rinconada Masters team.  The people and the pool are great.  For masters workouts, the lanes are hardly ever crowded.  I live in San Jose and work in Mountain View, and despite my schedule making it hard to swim at this pool, I still make time to go there because I like the people so much.

My only negative comment is that the water is occasionally over-chlorinated.  But most of the time the water is fine.<//Review>< gmap_id>

I'm giving this pool a low rating because it's open so infrequently. The hours for this pool are horrible. Opens late, closes early, not open for many parts of the week and parts of the year. Compared to Menlo Park's pool, the Palo Alto pool has embarrassingly lame hours.<//review>

<text>(Translated by Google) Honestly, I think the baked beans pushed me to 5 stars. Just perfect. Sweet and salty. It was at 4.5 for meat. I think I prefer a little more smoky taste in my ribs and my chest. However, they cooked slowly to perfection, with a lot of texture, but they detach themselves from the bone with faci¡ xxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxx dxxxx xxxxxx xx xxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxx loved it

<Text>I am traveling through the area and needed a hair cut. I chose Fusion and Selena because of the great reviews and was pleased I did. Selena asked great questions to make sure she knew how I wanted my hair cut. This morning I styled my hair the way I usually do and it turned out fantastic. That’s a great cut! And I enjoyed my visit with her as well. A delightful and talented young woman. Cheers<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

I called on Monday to see if they could get me in on Wednesday or Thursday and they were able to get me in Wednesday with Angie. I was kind of nervous never being to this salon before but as soon as I met Angie I felt a million times better. She's so sweet and really listened to what I wanted/needed from a hair cut. She did my eyebrows too and I am beyond happy with it all. My hair is amazing and my eyebrows are fantastic! Thank you a million times over! I will absolutely be coming back!< /text>

Got my hair cut today at the Gosford location. I showed the lady pictures of what I wanted, front, sides and back. It's nothing like the pictures and nothing like I wanted! I seriously can't believe I paid $30 dollars for this! The lady was nice and pleasant, but now I'm stuck with very little hair, and crying. Ugh</review>

Disappointed and not sure if I'll go back. I really like most of the ladies there though. I'm using my phone and it wont let me respond to the owner. I sent a email a while back with the first incident but i have never recieved a response. The first time was a wax from cheeks down to chin. Usually im charged 8$ this last time i was charged 25$. Then i went in for a hairstyle but i was quoted 30$ and it was written on a card with my appointment date. I had showed the stylist the style so i didn't understand why i was charged 45$. Maybe because i mentioned to her that it was for my wedding. Either way i feel it wasn't right to be quoted 30$ and charged 45$.< /text>< pics>

I haven't had my hair colored in 2 years and had an idea what I wanted but left the overall color up to the stylist, Selena. I'm so happy with my new color and hair cut and got compliments on it as soon as I left the salon. The staff is so friendly.<//Review>

<Rate>1</Rate><Review>I visited this salon because the good reviews they have on google. Unfortunately, my experience was not the best. I visited the salon on a Saturday afternoon, and they very busy. One young girl was taking all the walk-ins, and she seem very eager to finish all the clients quickly with out listening to what I really wanted. She chopped my hair here and there and in a few minutes she was done ready to take the next client. I was very disappointed. They may have better hair stylist there, but this young girl is surely not a good one.< /Review>< pics>

If you would like your hair redone by me, just call 834-0525 and set up an appointment with Jennifer. That way I can get a close look at what went wrong so I can redirect the stylist that cut your hair, and you will get the haircut you want.'}<//Resp>

<Review>Angela was amazing. I came in for a particular haircut and she did an amazing job. She could tell I was a little apprehensive and kind of talked me through what she though would look best. If I didn't live out of state, I would for sure be her regular.< /Review>< user_name>

<review>It's the first time in a while that I've come out of a salon this disappointed.     The girl that cut my hair paid little attention to me.  And when my hair wasn't quite looking the way I expected at the end, she said try styling it the way you like at home. "  It's looking better.  But damn.  Service bad.  And I still tipped..</review>< resp>

They're good. I mean I never liked the atmosphere of any Salon because I always fell like the people who work there are stuck up but there was this one girl who was relatively new & she was so nice & I felt as though our conversation was real & not forced. She did a great a job on my hair.
It's also interesting to hear the ladies conversations amongst each other & their drama, it's like a mini soap opera. It's not eavesdropping if I can hear them loud & clear without trying.

I have been going there for cut and color for a while now. The service is great and a very friendly staff. I love to do bright vibrant colors and funky cuts and they have given me a great Hairstyle and always get the right shade of red. I recommend this salon to everyone I know, I recommend it to you all also.</review>

I also felt uncomfortable because as she was cutting my hair the other girls that work there were making faces and laughing at the haircut she was giving me, I just wanted to get out of there I was so embarrassed and upset and I paid $18 for a haircut that I did not ask for. I had to go somewhere else to get it fixed never again will I go into this place and I do not recommend.< /text>< pictures>

I went in at 6:15. I understood there was a wait so I did wait and did not mind. What I didn't appreciate was one employee had a  customer "appointment" so she took him before me which ok whatever. But the fact that she had said "every one decided to come in last minute at the end of the day" and the man saying "just say sorry kid you gotta go" in front of me was very rude. I was going  to be a paying customer.I should have been treated as any one else.< /Text>

I went to hair fusion yesterday 02/27/15 and got the Tape in extensions, I was so excited to have long hair again. Today I was still excited because I liked them. Well that was until after I took a shower. I used a shampoo and detangling conditioner that is made for hair extensions and I bought a brush that was also made for extensions. After my shower I let my hair dry a little and started brushing the extensions and one fell out, I let it go because it was only one. I put my hair in a loose braid and watched tv for a while. I stood up and touched my hair and 3 more were hanging. Needless to say, my hair now looks stupid and since they are closed tomorrow I have to wait til Monday to go back and get a refund. I am extremely disappointed because they should of lasted longer than a day!< /text>

I love there selection of clothes. They have a bunch of awesome hoodie's to choose from. The prices are not too bad and the quality is nice. I would definitely recommend checking out the place if your looking for jackets, jeans, and i almost forgot to mention they have a nice variety of exercising outfits too. Also my favorite place when i need a new mask! They have the best masks...so comfy and cheap too. I got a 5 pack on sale for $1. Great deal 😷😁👍</Text>

I fell in love with this store and its manager Pat today. I was with my mom who was visiting from out of the country and did not know her correct US size. Despite the fact that the store was relatively busy and there were not too many sales associates available, Pat went out of her way and helped us to choose a perfect pair of jeans. She was such a pleasure to work with. No wonder the store looked like it ran smoothly! Employees seemed happy too! We will definitely be back!</Review>

Personal service if you request it. Stylish jackets, coats and vest available in women's  men's and children's section. I just purchased an interesting winter jacket for $20. I wear a light weight jacket underneath. Friends and family throughout weekends, November believe.< /Review>

<Review>From outside, I saw the beautiful display of  the blue  tunic length, so I came in  to take a  closer look. The lady sales  assistant greeted me, and I asked her where the rack for the said tunic length is. She directed me very kindly towards the women 's section.  That lady must be "big"( who cares!)but she is dressed very appropriately and looks very professional,  and above all,  her  Customer Service is PERFECT !
THANK YOU, I got myself 1 white and another blue which were both on  sale. Thank you again.</Review></record></dataset><record>

Given that this is the only Old Navy store in the city, the store has a wide variety of products. I believe they have everything old navy offers. The service is fine, pretty much what you'd expect from an Old Navy, you have to go up to the sales associates if you need anything tho some of them might come up to you and check it. On the register sometimes might be a line but the check out process doesn't take long as there are always plenty of people on the registers. Getting here is easy as it is located on market street and right next to the Powell street station, Don't ever think about driving here tho. Overall a nice store experience.</Review>

This store is awesome! I'm a closet lover of skulls, dark clothing and funky jewelry, and this store delivers. They also have lots of funny books, accessories and t-shirts. Their lingerie/corsets are not badly priced, and they seem to be of high quality. It's a fun store to shop.<//text>

<text>For casual wear this is the best store for everything but jeans. The quality is alright and there is a large variety in regards to men's clothing when compared to other retail locations.

The trick here is to not buy anything full price. There is always a coupon of some amount, if you really plan it you can get close to 70% off sticker.< /text>< userid>

Loads of selection here, big store with multiple floors and tons of sale racks all over the place. If you come with some time on your hands you'll find some amazing deals on basics, casual and business casual wear.</text>

This is by and far the best Old Navy in the area. Bot only because it's the biggest, but because the staff is so nice and attentive.  There is always someone there to answer a question, find a size, or do a price adjustment when your email pings a huge coupon 2 days after making a ginormous purchase.  Real talk, if you're going to shop at Old Navy, come to this one because they'll be helpful and kind. It's nice to go into a store and be treated well. The Serramonte and Tanforan locations do not have staff half as friendly as Market/5th st SF.<//review>

Sale prices are great, especially with supercash & the employees are helpful to. But the only thing i don't like is all the fluorescent lighting by the cash registers, feels like a sauna when your waiting in line.</review>

I love this place! Right now you can get 10.00 credit for every 25.00 that you spend
That means that this weekend is the perfect time to buy some more clothes with the money you gained by spending 25.00. Have fun.< /Review>

<time>1420955968593</time><user_name>Victoria P.<//user_name><Text>I'm a fan of their athletic wear.  The athletic clothes are durable and stylish.  The prices are competitive, and when they're on sale, then it's a really great deal!

As far as the other clothes are concerned, it's hit or miss.  I find that it looks stylish on the hanger, but not so good when I wear it.  Their clearance section can be a mess, only because there are a lot of people shifting through it.  If you have the patience, you might find some really good deals.

I found the staff to be really helpful and friendly.  And I like how there are places throughout the floor to try on something quick so you don't have to roam around the store and wait in line for the fitting rooms.< /Text>< pictures>

I needed to use the restroom walking down Market Street and I walked into Old Navy and asked staff if they had a bathroom. They were super nice and showed me to the restroom. I ended up buying some pj bottoms on sale for $7 which I think is great deal. Despite the long lines and holidays, the customer service is friendly and quick.< /Review>

<username>King Of Ahola Tarot, Not a Fan of His< /username><text>I've been to a lot of Old Navy stores - this is the flagship store so it's the biggest one I've even been in.  The clearance section rocks!  I've seen everything from UC Berkeley sweats to water bottles to shoes to dresses to coats - just about everything.  This store has a humongous selection.  If I remember correctly, this store has four stories worth of merchandise.  Men and women have their own stories.  Just be in the mood to shop.< /text>< resp>

Close by the MTA stop, three floors not making the store looking crowded.

Was there with a sale, some very nice prices. Selection of clothing is also nice. Their sports section has improved.

When I was looking at jeans for 15 minutes no staff came to help sadly.<//review>

3 floors jammed pack with clothes. Staff was friendly. They had a p/u option for online orders, which was nice. The bathroom always stinks though<//text>

<text>This must be the flagship Old Navy. I think it's 3 stories of Old Navy goodness with cashiers on every level.  Its good for a quick trip when you come to SF in the summer and realize its really cold and you need a sweater and don't want to pay for an overpriced souvenir sweater that doesn't keep you warm<//text>< name>

They have jeans of all washes for petite, regular and long; curvy, not so curvy, not curvy at all. Denim authorities may find the denim here to be of inferior quality to the $200 and up brands, but that's also the beauty of Old Navy jeans. You can break them in, yet they are durable, and if you still don't like it, it only will have cost you about $12-$35.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

<review>A nice big Old Navy (though, not as big as it used to be) with plenty of great deals. Even if there isn't a good sale happening, there's a big clearance section with some good finds at great prices. Checkout can take a while, though, especially with some registers closed on a whole floor or something.< /review><user_name>Nicolo T. (Nymo)<//user_name>< gmapID>

The store is very busy and not many staff on the floor or behind the counters. When I went to pay for my items the staff member processing my sale missed removing two metal tags from shirts. Then when the tags failed to come off easily he smashed it against the counter and tried again to remove it, he repeated this process multiple times. The shirt then had a large hole where the metal tag had pulled at the fabric. Not impressed.<//Review>

Perfectly positioned in the heart of SF. This store is unbelievably big, and has a huge variety of men, women, and children clothing. The staff are welcoming. If you don't find what you're looking for, you have all the shops in the world within a couple of minutes walk.</Text>

Three stories of Old Navy. The departments are not clearly separated, so you have to visit all three floors. Associates visible throughout the store. I was approached and offered assistance. Great place to pick up vacation extras.</review>

This Old Navy is conveniently located right next to the Westfield Shopping Center and almost always had a sale going on! The product quality is slightly hit or miss - even picking items of the same type and size, occasionally there are significant differences in fit.</review>

Every time I go in there they are very obvious about telling their security to keep an eye on me because I wear a backpack. It's rude. Once, maybe twice. But every time? They make a point of being so obvious it's offensive. So much that I hate going in there  when I desperately need clothes (and I like theirs even though they shrink a lot).
The line is painfully slow every time. And there's always a high pitch tone at the check out that is not good for anyone's ears. Especially those that work next to it all day. Line is so SLOW.<//Text>

A good store where you can get good deals when they have sales & you have coupons. Their clothing tends to be colorful. They are related to Gap so you get points & discounts with purchases from their sister stores.<//review>

I really like the quality of the clothes here, its not too pricey it's at an okay range and there is also cute clothes, I would say for children, it really is good to shop here if you're looking to buy birthday clothes, or for cristmas. The customer service is decent, they offer you help and are very nice to help one.<//Text>

Good prices, nice clothes but you have to visit more times to have lucky to find clothes of your size.</Text>

As a guy, I hate shopping. This Old Navy is very navigatable. Mens department is on the third floor, jeans are in the center, none of the employees are pushy, and they have a large selection of items to choose from. All the checking out I've ever done has gone very smoothly, and all in all, if I have to go to an Old Navy, I don't mind going to this one.<//Review>

<Rate>4<//Rate><text>Oh the temptations of $10 tees and $20 jeans. Old Navy has the cheapest clothes PERIOD! Sure they wont as long but you can buy cheap clothes and then throw them and buy more cheap clothes! Isn't that a better deal than buying expensive clothes that you have to keep wearing for much longer?
They have Two floors for females and one for males. There are more than fitting rooms for you to tryout the clothes and 364 days of the year, they will also have sales/promotions going on. Parking around market street is impossible so find a garage and dont forget your bags unless you want to pay for the bag.</text>< Pics>

<Review>Well I was basically just going in there to look for a backpack and nobody even came around to help us. Luckily, I wasn't alone because my mother was with me and the black lady tried to walk right through us when I didn't see her at first. She came in front of me and said, "excuse me" in an almost rude way while she was escorting the other customer. Of course I didn't say anything to her. My mother was trying to ask her something about the backpacks and I told her that we should look elsewhere. Until I got fed up with this store that didn't have a selection of backpacks I wanted to buy, we left the store feeling totally invisible!  It was just ridiculous that no shopping stores had any backpacks (which is what I really wanted). On the way out I hear that annoying retail lady standing in front of the doorway saying, "thank you have a nice day" "come back soon."  I mean to me, it almost sounded like she or "it" was antagonizing me just because we were both leaving the store with disappointment and feeling a lil invisible.<//Review><Rating>1<//Rating><user_name>Myra D< /user_name>< pics>

Lots of selection, but staff are variable- sometimes helpful, sometimes they seem overly suspicious because I'm dressed too casually</review>

(Translated by Google) I have been ordering old nevi from the site for a long time, I hit the store for the first time. I liked the clearance - it’s convenient that in one place you don’t have to sort out the hangers, as in the opposite of Forever 21.
I really liked the consultants! Polite and pleasant, sincerely want to help - my English is very bad.

(Original)
Давно заказываю олд неви с сайта, в магазин попала в первый раз. Клиренс понравился - удобно, что в одном месте и не надо перебирать вешалки, как в фореве 21 напротив.
ОЧЕНЬ понравились консультанты! Вежливые и приятные, искренне хотят помочь - мой английский очень плох.< /Review>

<review>(Translated by Google) Great clothes shop on Market street. If you are on vacation in San Francisco, definitely give us a lift. The prices are absolutely competitive. Take the time to shoot it all because the distribution of the products follows a particular logic, so the products you are looking for could be anywhere.

(Translated by Google) I went to look for some leggin and I found some denim pants with thermal lining inside, especially for cities with low temperatures, they are difficult to find and at a very good price. The store is three stories, you have to go ahead. For children they have sweatshirts with original prints on the city of San Francisco, CA.
