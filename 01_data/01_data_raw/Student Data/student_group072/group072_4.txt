This food is the best seafood around here. It is a bit spicy, but it's worth it! My family and I always get take-out and it's always on point. The staff is always really nice and helpful too. Always coming back.< /Text>

I have been hearing a lot of great things about this restaurant and had to check it out for myself. My girlfriend and I are super foodies and tried out this place a month ago, and we have been going back once a week. The hype is definitely real, food is amazing. Don't believe me, go try it for your self. You'll thank me later !< /Text>

Not only is the food delicious but the staff there is very welcoming and friendly! You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu! The Birria is best! The quesabirrias are 🔥 the sushi is never a miss! I recommend the baby face roll, the war roll, and the licenciado 👌🏼 my favorite appetizer are the humming birds, you can never go wrong with a stuffed jalapeño! Lastly, don't get me started on their mariscos 🤤🤤 tostada embarazada Is a must!!!< /review>

<Text>Came here after being recommended by my friends to try it. “Try the hot Cheeto roll.” they said. I immediately thought about how gross chip inspired anything is and cringed at the thought of it. I had a rather unpleasant experience with sushi the last time I ate it at Victoria Garden’s so I wasn’t too keen on eating sushi again any time soon but on a whim I decided to stop here on a pass by. I’m glad I did. The hot Cheeto roll was the best roll I’ve had in my life. It was pricey at 15$ after adding salmon but it was so delicious. The girls at the counter were very kind. The wait was a bit long at half an hour but that can be slipped by calling ahead. 10/10 would recommend.<//Text><UserId.>109747661051449369393< /UserId.><pics>None<//pics><time>1610346829506< /time></record>

<Resp>{'time': 1617287863349, 'text': 'Hi Anna, our sushi is not that of a typical sushi place. Our California roll carries ingredients no other place offers, therefore it will be higher price. Fresh foods and unique flavors is what sets us apart.'}</Resp><Review>I will start by saying that they do have tasty food "Buuuuut" they charge $7 for a six piece California roll 😲! That is the most I have ever paid and they charge xtra for eel sauce too! Not good, California rolls come in 8 to 10 pieces every where else I've ordered them at, but Sumabi gives you six and at a higher price.

Absolutely recommend this place. Everything is made fresh to order and the flavor is unique, from their sushi to their tacos and mariscos. If you’re ever in Colton it is a must try! I give it a 10/10 one of my favorite places.< /text>

Lady at the front counter amazing customer service rest of the staff arrogant and rude, I purchase a tostada embarazada ! not bad, not the best.Sushi rolls extremely small!  jasmine tea was amazing.

I’ve been living in the IE for about a year now and this place is by far the BEST in sushi, seafood and birria. It’s a MUST try.< /Review>

<Review>Great ambience and easy location to get to. For the people aren't familiar with this type of restaurant, they serve sushi, mariscos (seafood) and birria... Hence the amalgam. Very authentic and delicious taste. I suggest trying their fresh sushi. You can tell they use great quality fish and take their time to serve you top quality food and service. Will definitely come back again!

PS. Their drinks are amazing too!</Review>< pictures>

The food is overpriced and tastes bland and to top it off they gave me a bad avocado as you can see in the picture. The wait time to get our food was over 30 minutes, took too long.</text>

<text>Food was good just very overpriced for a little big plate with little bit of . Service was so bad I ask 4 different girls for “tostadas” none of them brought it till I was finished and I asked again to my main server. Just needs to improve on food and price ratio.< /text>< pictures>

An amazing place where you will be mesmerized by the huge tall trees. You can just wonder how can these trees grow so huge. The drive to reach the trail head is also as amazing as the trail. It's is a little tricky but absolutely worth it. Drive safe there. Posting a video of the drive to the trail head.<//review>

<Review>Nice and quiet in early April. Lots of incredibly large trees. Road to the trailhead still had a bit of snow in a few places and sure enough a big pickup was stuck in it. I parked at the main road and hikes the extra 2 miles.<//Review></record>

Great hike with great views to the east and west! The big Sequoias are so magnificent along the trail! Well worth the drive and price of admission! Get the annual pass to the Parks and you can come back over and over to see this amazing place!</Review>< pictures>

One of the largest Sequoia groves, nice scenic trail, certainly not crowded. Road to trailhead could use some maintenance but plenty of parking and has pit toilet available.< /review>

Absolutely incredible hike(s). Trails are shaped like heart 💓 with additional trail splitting the heart in halfs and trailhead located at the bottom of the heart. You can hike right side (6mi) only or left side (7mi) only or whole heart (13-14mi). If you do right half that go counterclockwise for easier hike and clockwise for more intense hike. And if you do left side and then go clockwise for easier hike and counterclockwise for more intense.
And one more VERY important point: to get to trailhead you will need to go on dirt road and in couple places you might need people to get out of the car to get better clearance. But if you go slow and pay attention then this dirt should not be a problem.</text>

Red Mountain Loop- a fairly easy overnighter but one of the only places I've heard of where you can actually sleep among the giant Sequoias, even the groves themselves are worth the day hike (plus views of Kings Canyon). There are some excellent little established sites for camping if you keep hiking towards Big Spring. Crowds at the entrances of both loops, but hiking just a few miles yields decent solitude.< /text>

Beautiful and totally empty (no tourists in flip-flops!) park. A lot of sequoias, super quiet with a creek at the bottom of the valley.<//text>

Two medium loops or one big loop from 7-11 miles or so. Good area if you’re a trail runner and want to stretch out on a trail with fewer people. The road to the trailhead is a little bumpy and narrow- I’d be nervous if it was icy. More of a natural area to view big trees with deadfall and burn scarring.<//Review>

Hiked the Sugar Bowl then up Redwood Creek as a loop through this area by suggestion of a Forest Ranger. Ended up climbing a mountain with the most amazing views but the best part is the many groves of trees and solitude. Once you get to the furthest point before going down to the creek you see Sequoias as big as the tourist areas.  There is bear poop along the trail so I’m sure there would be a lot of sightings. Some parts of the trail are overgrown with poison oak and ivy present so wear long pants if you are sensitive. I would hike this again but use the Hart trail on the way back.<//Review>

I can see how it could be buggy in the summer, but in the beginning of November it is perfect! The trail is almost completely shaded. While there are only a few overlook spots, the entire hike you are surrounded by sequoia trees. In the fall, the leaves change colors, and it's absolutely beautiful. Not very strenuous and has a few streams and a little waterfall.<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< user_id>

<text>Check for fire activity during the summer months before heading to the trail head. Only 2 miles of the trail were open along the ridge when I went in July, due to a control burn. The trail is quieter than most other trails in the park though. Bring bug spray, lots of mosquitoes and other bugs.<//text>< pics>

<Review>Amazing hikes, giant sequoias, creeks, and Vistas. Great place to enjoy nature and the experience. The trails are definitely moderate to strenuous in difficulty. Bring loads of water, healthy snacks. And first aid. You may want to consider appropriate hiking boots, gear, and clothes. The canyon and the rest of the park is littered with caves although thier locations are unmarked, undisclosed, and closed off which if your a cave enthusiast it's kind of a bummer but moving on. Still want to find Lilburn cave.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None</Resp><gmap_id>0x80956ef121d3fd39:0x67849ee9e1441ac<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

My nephew made me drive him from Orcutt downtown to get his hair cut here. I see why. They did a great job and their prices are on point. The staff are friendly and they shop is clean. Great barbershop.</review>

Visiting in town and needed a last minute cut.  Called and they said they were taking walkins and to come through.  Jose put me in his chair right away and did my fade & line up clean AF. Clean shop. Worth my money.<//Review>

I was very impressed with my cut, and will be calling to set up an appointment for next week.

The process of getting set up for aligners was easy and the staff was super friendly and helpful. My daughter wants to get rid of crowding that happened from not wearing her retainers for a few ears after regular braces. We got a blue light teeth whitening system as part of the package, too. Price is way lower than regular ortho. We’re happy!< /review>

I had been contemplating on setting up my appointment for almost 6 months. I finally went online and setup a same day appointment. I was welcomed in by Jamie at the Redwood city store. She was very polite and communicated everything that I would be doing at my appointment. She made me feel very much as ease. She made sure that I Express  my concerns during this one-time 3D scan visit. That to me was very important because at first, I was a bit shy but she knew how to make me feel at ease. I would recommend Smile Direct Club to anyone who is looking to brighten their smile with people who really care about you.</review>

This was so much simpler and quicker than I could have guessed. I was debating whether I should go into the office or do the molds myself and I’m soooo glad I went in. All the ladies in the office were super sweet and Lisa who walked me through the whole process was phenomenal. I’m super happy and pleased with my decision and the experience as a whole so far.</review>

It was an easy and enjoyable experience going to the Smile Direct office in Redwood City. Gayle explained the program and process thoroughly and I left feeling like I finally found a great solution for my teeth at a competitive price. Again thanks for making it so easy.

I had an easy, quick experience at Smile Direct in Redwood city. They just ask you a few questions and then take 3D prints of your teeth which is pretty cool to see the true position of your teeth. My smileguide Stephanie P. was super nice and walked me through everything and made my experience better by making me feel comfortable jumping into straightening my teeth in a more convenient way (plus I got a free whitening kit).</Review>

<review>Wonderful experience.

The staff is very helpful and informative and they made me feel welcome from the moment I stepped in. The 3D scan with Gayle was a quick and easy process and was very cool to see!

I definitely recommend this place for anyone needing a good place to start and is looking for cheaper alternatives. They double check everything and make sure you’re set to go before you leave, answering any/all questions you may have.

10/10 highly recommend!</review><resp>{'time': 1565209208915, 'text': 'We are loving your enthusiasm, Nicole! This means the world to us -- thank you so much'}< /resp>< rating>

<date>1566429267397< /date><text>Such an amazing experience from booking, to my appointment, to receiving my aligners. Thank you so much to Gayle for providing the best customer service and having such a thorough knowledge of the Smile Direct aligners. Gayle answered all of my questions and was really patient with me as I was kind of nervous about the system. I've had past troubles with oral care as a kid/teenager so as an adult I was a little scared to try something new. Gayle made me feel supported and honestly really excited to start this new smile journey. Thank you again!

There were 3 appointments that were scheduled at the same time and only one dentist available. The team was proactive and called before hand to try and get me to come in earlier which I appreciated however I felt rushed in the chair during my scan. I was already committed to the purchase but if the prices didn’t go up after 5/31 then I would have for sure asked to come back another time when they weren’t rushing to get to the next person.< /text>

They couldn’t/refused to tell me about my gum recession problem, and my periodonist told me their 5-month treatment plan would only worsen my situation. I even sent them the letter and report from periodonist. He said if I carried forward with the aligners my situation could be disastrous! Smiles Direct Club asked me to ship back aligners for a refund but refused to be responsible for shipping costs because it’s their “policy”. How could they justify having customers pay for shipping back something useless and harmful? I called many times and they failed to provide me with a helpful response. Today I reached out to their dental team and they honestly told me their scans are actually incapable of detecting other dental issues, and that my case really shouldn’t have been approved.< /Text>

I originally walked past the store but its actually located in 'Sola Salon Studios' which is a kind of mall for multiple beauty businesses. It is very clean and welcoming inside.

I was assisted by Gayle, who was very warm and friendly. I actually work for a dental lab so I had alot of questions that she was able to answer or was able to direct me to a way of finding my answer.

The procedure was easy and quite fun, actually.

I was there maybe a total of 20 minutes.</text><Time>1564285265551< /Time></record></dataset><record>

Please do yourself a favor and consult a real orthodontist!  I had a terrible experience and unless you have very minor corrections needed, would not recommend a mail-order service.  You will NEVER get a chance to speak to the actual dentist/orthadontist working on your case. So all questions go through a 3rd party support that is outsourced outside the country. I had problems with bite after treatment and never received the aligners in an attempt to help.  Waited now 3 months and the outsourced customer support is very unhelpful with repeated mistakes. Also, despite what the website claims, no insurance accepts them, so if I would have gone to a "real" orthodontist it would have been the same cost.  Truly a huge disappointment on all aspects.</Review>

I was very impressed with the experience I had visiting this Smile Direct Club location. The staff was kind and prompt and even used the opportunity to share some insights and information about the technology the company uses to scan and create molds.

Overall I was really surprised at just how quick the 3D scan of my teeth was. I was in-and-out in less than 15 minutes and got to take home a teeth whitening tool and some other goodies.<//Text>

Very thorough explanation of the entire process and it felt better for me to go to the office rather than do it by mail.

I gave four stars because the technician brushed over two of my concerns 1 that I detected a change in her voice after she put her trays in (I use my voice for a living) and 2 I talked about my concern with what I’ve heard about not so great customer service and she brushed it aside. She seemed really nervous, I assume because she’s new or relatively new.

Other than those two things she did a great job!<//review>

<Review>Pros
1) Very cordial, informative, helpful dental assistant who walked me through entire process.
2) Modern hi-tech 3D scanning done in minutes.
3) They accept HSA, FSA
4) Payment options available.
5) Nice, clean place
6) many before and after photographs available
7) I am going to get video of myself before and projected AFTER
8) 6-8 months treatment
9) Warranty on aligners
10) Licensed orthodontist inspect the progress every 90 days

Cons
1) I had to wait 20 minutes after my appointment time due to rush. May be because I did not confirm my appointment using link they sent me previous day.</Review><username>Neel Valame< /username><date>1553376109217<//date>< pictures>

Great experience with Marisol today for the scan. She took me on time, was very knowledgable and very sweet. She did a great job explaining the process and asking if I had any questions. The place was clean. She was gentle and respecting the hygiene practices too. Thank you.</text>

<text>#1,Manager now is "Jamie", not  "Janette" listed on emails. Tsk tsk, sloppy.

#2,Had to call twice(2 call centers, somewhere) to get address of free on Saturday for 90 min parking, public garage around corner. The address is "830 JEFFERSON" for your GoogleMap navigation.

#3,Had to call to see if AmEx cards accepted. Should list accepted forms of payment.

#4, Was told I would receive side by side pictures of old crooked teeth and new graphic design in "72 hours"/3 days. Did not happen.

#5, lots of emails before visit, but not to local store and Manager, "Jamie", but to headquarters in Nashville. So way too many redundant emails and none to the local store and Manager I was to visit.

#6, tablet contract was hard to sign on the bottom edge without a desk and better e-pen.

#7, When I arrived, the office was empty. Understaffed?
I pushed a button on the counter to "check-in". Odd.
Sat and waited, early for appt. Am I expected??
Then manager Jamie(not a Dentist)showed up and had me fill out a too tiny tablet form and told me she got "none of my email replies." Odd.
The office is in a building of lots of barbers and other skin care tiny stalls, so you have to search once inside the main door, not the front to the side service entrance door.  Oops! It should be signed, "SERVICE ENTRANCE ONLY". I avoid RWC and the rude jury duty or greedy unjust traffic court so don't know it as well as other Peninsula cities.

#8, I was told my aligners may be for only "6-12 months" instead of "2 years" as my teeth aren't so bad. But my dentist says "Slower is always better than faster for aligning teeth with braces or clear plastic devices."

I'm 'a bite' worried, but paid with my AmEx card.< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

Visited the SmileShop in Redwood City today.   What a great experience.  The team working there were very nice and welcoming.

After filling in some personal info on their iPad, it was off to another office for the 3D image of my teeth and smile.  Quisa, a dental assistant, was efficient, friendly and fast in doing the image.  She answered all my questions.  The technology is amazing.

Once the 3D image was complete, we talked about next steps and the payment plan ($1895 or $250 down and $85 month for 24 months).  This is about the third of the cost for regular braces.  And on average, takes about 6 months of wearing aligners all the time except when eating and drinking.

I am not yet sure that I will order the aligners but I highly recommend checking out the SmileShop in Redwood City.<//Text>

Everyone was very helpful, clearly explained the process, and were great representatives.
I would recommend you get various lip spreaders as the one used bruised my lip.< /Review>

From our first phone conversation that we had with Eli at SES builders, I understood that this is a different company that work differently from all the other ones. Eli really understood the value of the relationship that must have when a remodeling project is achieved and he understood clearly our expectations. During our meetings at our that house, Eli didn’t relied just on our personal design concepts and more than that, his design process started with our design preferences and included additional solutions to several items that we wanted to have but unfortunately they couldn’t be implemented. One of the ideas of Eli was to take down one wall that separated our kitchen from the rest of the house and we loved that idea because it made the house with a much larger open space. The remodeling went fast and Eli made sure that the crew will work at the house on a daily basis making sure that the daily tasks will be accomplished. While the work was in progress, Eli went with us to several vendors in order to select the right materials for our remodeling. We are very happy with everything they did for us and our remodeling present how professional and knowledgeable this company is as well as thorough and original.<//text>

<Review>I was looking for the best or nothing. When I saw the Ideas the Designers at SES brought up, I was blown away. It was different and beautiful. The fact that I also got to explore the proposed kitchen in 3D and now in real life is just amazing. They took extreme care to flesh out all the perks and designs. The cabinetry and countertops are magnificent and the colors are just so lively. Joe and his team nailed my ideas to the T. I would use their expertise again for any other job. They are worth every penny. Superb😀😯</Review>< gmapID>

<Review>Eli did a great work with our renovation project! he was able to include all the ideas that we asked for and still to work within our budget. The house now looks like a completely different house. Modern look, beautiful high end with a great budget.. It wasn't expensive compared to the result. Definitely add more value to our house. During the remodeling, Eli came over each day and worked with the people. He made sure that everything in the kitchen, bathrooms will be installed correctly and that no mistakes will accord. We do recommend Eli and to hire him for projects such this. My mom decided to renovate her home as well now since the result was beyond amazing. It's a reliable company with a great and experienced team.<//Review>< pics>

He was very happy with the work that they did and he recommend them to anyone he knows that looking for a contractor regarding to any remodeling project. The bathroom that they did at my house have a complete new look and is now more functional and easy to use. While they were working, I noticed how clean, neat, pleasant to talk to and helpful. My remodeling project was to expand the bathroom into the laundry room and guest bath while keeping the laundry as well but in different shape. Eli was able to provide original and reasonable results while keeping it on budget.< /Review><Response>None<//Response>< user_id>

I have been contracted by a former SES client to inspect work done. The workmanship was horrible!

Contractors State License Board investigation has been initiated, Bond Complaint and investigation has commenced. They will not get away with overpricing clients and delivering such a horrible finished product.<//Review>

SES builders was the company that we hired to remodel our old kitchen, creating a new design of the kitchen, cabinets, wood floor and counters. Eli and his team of workers were very flexible by going with us step by step in everything that was included in the designing and building the new kitchen. All the coordination of deliveries and orders including the deadlines and installation dates was very good, even though a lot of workers and people were involved in this project. Susan was the designer and she was able to incorporate all of our ideas and needs and she was professional, knowledgeable, supportive and pleasant lady to work with. I had some ideas that were too much and she rolled with it, even though I know she would have made other choices. The kitchen, which was very old, was demolished to the ground and was rebuilt. At the end, we ended up with Diamond cabinets that Eli recommended us and because all the additions that we could add even after the kitchen was completed and they are beautiful and sturdy. The travertine tile for the floors and the granite counters came out perfect. We felt more and more comfortable with each stage that the workers from SES builders did to our project. They were uniformly prompt, courteous, and pleasant and did a good job. They interacted well with our local builders. Nice work</Text>

After my research for a good company to remodel my kitchen and to replace the floor at the dining room area, I decided to hire this company for the job. My decision was made after my meetings with several contractors and compare what they offered me. Eli from SES builders, was able to give me the most things in the estimate and my meeting with him showed me that he can do the job on the best side without me worried about if he will completed it or not. After my meeting with him and reviewing all the documents, Eli start to plan and setup a schedule time frame for the work. The workers start to show up at the house and preforming what they need to do while Eli is monitoring the work on a daily basis. The remodeling took close to a month and I don't recall any problem during the work. I noticed that the workers arrive each day and that the materials are being delivered to the house. Eli and his office staff used to inform me about any delivery that should arrived and he also joined me to select the final materials such as Faucet, tiles, lights, floor etc....
This remodeling project was as easy as it could be for me. Eli heard all my comments and some of them he even adopted and made sure that the workers will implement them. Excellent 😀</review>

My experience with SES builders was more than wonderful. I recently purchased a house that required a lot of remodeling and updates to the bathroom, living room and the kitchen. After heavy online research and negotiations, I decided to hire SES builders for that heavy work. The price that I got from Illy was reasonable and fit to my budget (and the online research that I did on them was very good too) so I decided to give them a chance and to work for me. They completely remodeled my living room by:
-	Replacing the floor
-	New paint
-	Installing new baseboards
On the kitchen part, they did basically everything and the same in the master bathroom. The work that they did was to my opinion - high quality and it was also a pleasant work. I always receive a new compliment at how great everything looks now! Thanks again for all of the help SES builders Team!</Review>

We just completed our remodeling project with SES builders. From the very first meeting, we knew they would be able to make our visions and needs come true. Our remodeling project was not an easy task with new design of the existing layout of the kitchen and bathrooms. With the help of their designer, they were able to generate an amazing open floor plan. I must mention that during the work, we were always able to get a hold of Roi when we had questions or loud thoughts. Weekly updates were given to us about any progress of the work and when and problem came up with a relevant solution. With this expansion of the space, the conversion of the kitchen to the living room was just an amazing thing to do and the house look much bigger and brighter. The work was completed in 6 weeks only and Overall, we are very happy with all the people from SES builders team that were part of our remodeling and we are in love with every aspect of our new look of the house.</Text>

<Resp>None<//Resp><Review>Eliram and his team are legendary. They took my home from zero to a hundred real quick and without breaking a sweat. I highly recommend this SES Builders to anyone. The craftsmanship, level of commitment, customer service and actual delivery time will knock your socks off. Although the project involved a ton of different things the fact that they were able to finish in the proposed time is worthy of note. I love the new look; the furnishing and finishing are superb and the light retouching of the landscape is worth the investment. Recommended.</Review>< user_id>

Last month we renovated our pool and 2 bathrooms. We didn't have any ideas in mind. Shira was helping us choosing tiles, matching it to the entire house and helped us find good prices.
She was always available to answer our calls and respond to every question we had.< /Review>

I contracted SES Builders to add a room to my House and for a kitchen remodel also. It was a complex job that involved extending the kitchen with the added room and remodeling it. I was very picky about choosing a contractor but after comparing prices and weighing the value of each one I picked SES as the winner. Looking at my remodeled kitchen now I am just so glad I made that choice. They did a wonderful job with the addition and then the remodeling. At first, it didn’t look like much but when it all came together it was magical. The customer reception is great and the staffs are friendly as well. Great job.<//text>

He was asking all contractors for referrals and the only one that were really positive were for SES and thats why he picked them.
After making all the payments and finishing the job and signing a certificate of completion, we had a small issue with the faucet that be bought. Even though is was not SES problem, and eventhough the project was over, they came back to install us a new faucet at no charge!

We had a fantastic experience with Beni and his crew of workers. I wanted to paint my house but I didn’t have an idea of what colors to use. Beni with his knowledge, he was able to provide me with some color samples of how he would paint the house and my selection was pretty easy after I saw them. At the end, his selection of colors came out great. His crew were very polite and professional. Beni even did some extras tasks for me like change out the a/c filter and generally looked around and gave me opinions about house projects that might need to be done. I thought his price was very reasonable as well. Definitely recommend for renovate paint and/or design!<//review>

<Text>I hired SES builders to remodel my kitchen because of their seemingly spotless reputation online. My experience with them ended up being the WORST I HAVE EVER HAD with a contractor.

Final cost was way above initial quote. Craftsmanship was so poor that many aspects of the job had to be redone by them, or in many cases, myself to get it right.

They never completed my job, though we’re paid in full. They avoided me until I filed a report with the State Contractors Licensing Board. Only then did they contact me, promising to return and complete the job within a few days. They never showed up and never responded again.

Let my experience serve as a warning for anyone that would consider hiring such a deceptive, and completely unprofessional business. The employees I dealt with were Eliram (owner) and Eran who directly oversaw my project.< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Rate>1</Rate><user>110317231228749302488</user>< GmapID>

We hired SES builders to remodel our kitchen. The work was managed by Eli and his crew of people. Eli came over the house during the whole time of the remodeling making sure that the work is going as planed and that there are no issues or problems with the work. More than that, he went with us to see and select the cabinets, counter tops, back splash and the rest of the items for the kitchen. The work that he did took close to a month in which there was no problem with any of the people that did the actual work. At the end, Eli came over and did his own inspection before telling us that the work is done and before asking for the final check. We are very happy and we will hire him in the future.</Review>

Ad part of our research for a contractor, we got a reference from a friend that SES builders is a great construction company that deliver a great work and that we will be will happy with them. From the early meetings that we had with Eli Susan to go over our requirements and financial plan, to the completed work, there was never a time when we felt that we did any kind of a mistake by hiring him. We our remodeling project included several parts on our home, we knew we wanted to have someone who we would be comfortable with, honest, quality person and who knew his skills. Eli Susan was our guy! SES builders installed new windows throughout the house and completely remodeled the master bathroom. He walked us through the inspections, helped us with truthful advices, was detailed in his work and highlighted places to buy products to stay within the budget. We truly can’t write bad things about anyone from the crew and sub-contractors. They were on time, very nice guys and always cleaned up before leaving for the day. We can say they enjoyed what they did and took pride in their work. Eli Susan was very professional, quick to respond and stopped by nearly daily to check the progress of the work. Issues and concerns were handled immediately which was a big relief. A huge thank you to Eli Susan and all the guys. We highly recommend SES builders!< /Review>

Our first meeting was with Eli and it went really well, he explained to us the process in detail and gave some really good design ideas we ended up implementing into our remodel. Using the closet space to create a large master bathroom was his idea. Their bid was reasonable as well in comparison to others. We picked Eli for our project because we felt like he fits the most with his positive energies and the extra design assistance he extended to us. Once we signed a contract Eli created for us a 3D design of the bathroom, it looked very realistic and showed us in clarity what the new bathroom is going to look like. Following our approval of the design, Eli took us shopping for tiles, vanity and fixtures, this type of assistance was not offered by any other contractor and was extremely helpful. The planning took us about two weeks, the construction work took a total of 5 weeks including all the inspections we needed to pass. Eli was on top of everything all the time! Other than doing a good work and passing all inspections, he also gave us daily updates and kept our home as clean as possible within the limitations of construction. Having this work done on our house and having only one functional bathroom, with a working husband and two kids, was not easy. Thanks to Eli we went through it quickly and now we have a beautiful, 5 star hotel looking, bathroom to call our own. Thanks Eli and SES builders!<//review>

SES builders was the company that we hired to remodel our old kitchen, creating a new design of the kitchen, cabinets, wood floor and counters. Eli and his team of workers were very flexible by going with us step by step in everything that was included in the designing and building the new kitchen. All the coordination of deliveries and orders including the deadlines and installation dates was very good, even though a lot of workers and people were involved in this project. Susan was the designer and she was able to incorporate all of our ideas and needs and she was professional, knowledgeable, supportive and pleasant lady to work with. I had some ideas that were too much and she rolled with it, even though I know she would have made other choices. The kitchen, which was very old, was demolished to the ground and was rebuilt. At the end, we ended up with Diamond cabinets that Eli recommended us and because all the additions that we could add even after the kitchen was completed and they are beautiful and sturdy. The travertine tile for the floors and the granite counters came out perfect. We felt more and more comfortable with each stage that the workers from SES builders did to our project. They were uniformly prompt, courteous, and pleasant and did a good job. They interacted well with our local builders. There were a couple of small issues after the kitchen was completed Eli came over a week after and took care of everything. Overall, for us, this was a very positive, successful process and we love the result.< /review>

<Text>We had a lot of contractors that came to give us an estimate. We were searching for long time. We wanted to do a complete home remodeling, but had to make sure we choose the best company to do so. SES builders have been nothing but exceptional! Roy is a brilliant advisor. He was original, comprehensive, bright and loving. His wide knowledge is particularly helpful when it comes to decisions making. The company  was able to create a perfect result to our house. SES finished of time and very quickly for any design changes and patiently took as much time as we needed during the design meetings. Eli the owner was always on top of our remodeling. Before the design was approved, he personally came over to confirm the drawings. It has been few months since the remodeling project got completed and we are still impressed by how our new house came out including its beauty and design. This project was completed on time and within the budget we had agree.<//Text>< Pictures>

My Wife and I just had SES builders upgrade the bath tub and floor in our bathroom. We meet Eli and found him very honest, funny person, helpful and a person with great advises as to what works will best in the small bathroom.  We were happy with the estimate that he was able to give us and he sent out his expert tile man, Marcus who did an amazing job!  To see the space and what can he do there too? Marcus was on time every day and he had to redo the foundation and floor, as it was very old. In addition to that, he had to rebuild the space for the bath tub prior to the new installation of it and floor. We couldn't have been more pleased! Eli did expert work, very cleaned and detailed. They worked up daily and they were so nice and pleasant people.  We are so thrilled with this bathroom.  We had no idea it would look so nice... I can't recommend this company enough. SES builders is the one stop shop place... they provide everything that you will need for the job.  If you are looking to upgrade or remodel your bath or kitchen, go with them!< /review>

<text>Eli of SES builders is definitely the best contractor we have ever worked and dealt with! This was not the first time we hired him but the second. We have been totally happy in both remodeling projects. Eli was well organized, professional, and honest and always answers or returns our calls quickly. When we met with him, we noticed how patient and helpful he is with everything from listening, understanding planning and handling changes that came up during the work. His crews arrived to the house on time each day and they worked efficient with quality. Our latest remodeling included major repairs/remodeling after a flood that happened to us while we were in a vacation, and we decided to live in the house while the work was in progress. This difficult time was with as less stress as possible thank to Eli by getting the work done on time and with personal attention and concern for our relief. Eli was even able to finish the work earlier than expected. We are completely satisfied with SES builders, and that is why we will keep hire them in the future!</text><user>101868418491211338984<//user></record>

<text>This is the third time that we worked with SES builders and with Eli. The first time that we worked with him, Eli and his workers remodeled the living room and bedrooms and bring a new life with new and efficient painting, crown molding, new carpet and some custom closets and they were remodeled some houses our friends and the comments that we got from our guests, just proved us exactly what we were looking for, and Eli delivered. So, after that great experience, we decided to have Eli, Marry and their workers that worked at the house at the first time, to help us by reforming a complete bathroom at the house. Eli and Marry from the office, took the time to hear us and to understand what we would like to do and helped us figuring what we want to do or can do with the bathroom. To be honest, we thought that we knew what we want, but after several great discussions and meetings with Eli, we came up with a different layout of the bathroom, and it worked out perfectly.  We truly love our new bathroom. Eli is the person that you want when it comes to any project that you want to do at your house. He put a lot of attention to details, he know how to listen to you and all he wants, is to see you happy and pleased. He is always responsive with his communication.  Any question or concern that we had, he respond with an email, phone call, or even text within short period of time. Many thanks to Eli, Marry, and the people that worked at the house team and for the extra steps that they did for us and to make sure that we got what we want.</text><date>1513635396430</date>< pictures>

<review>Several months ago me and my Husband were thinking of doing a complete remodeling for our kitchen and living room because we felt it is about time to get new energies at the house. Our kitchen and living room were outdated and the paint needed to get a fresh coat and some repairs too. We knew what we liked but we didn’t have any idea how and what do to. We called SES Builders after we got their information from a friend who lives in the bay area and hired them for his house and apparently they did a wonderful job there. After we spoke to their office in Los Angeles and we scheduled a meeting with their rep Eli. During our meeting, we explained Eli what we like, what we have in mind and what our budget for that project is. Eli came up with a perfect kitchen and living room design which looks like he read our minds and put it on a paper. The work went without any problem, no delays and no stress. We love our kitchen and living room area and we will definitely recommend them and hire them again.</review>< Pictures>

After meeting with 3 different contractors, we decided to hire Eli to remodel our master bathroom and kitchen. In addition to that, we also wanted him to knock down a wall in order to expand the master closet and updated the master bedroom. This was the first remodeling project that we did for the master bedroom since we purchased the house. Our decision to hire Eli was because his knowledge, his experience and behavior and mainly his previous remodeling projects that did match our vision ideas and the quality of the finish projects. During the remodeling, Eli involved several sub-contractors and all of them were very dependable, trustworthy & they made sure to clean-up after each day of work. Each one of the ‘in house’ workers was a specialist one, so we knew that work will be top notch. After consulting with Eli on the actual remodeling and what we are expecting to get form him, we can write that now when the remodeling is done, Eli was able to meet all our expectations. Eli considered what we want and he offered several suggestions to deliver all the changes we asked for. My husband and I would certainly hire him again if we have any more projects on our house.
The work that was done in master bathroom was:
a.	All the old tiles, popcorn ceiling and wallpaper were removed.
B.	Few walls were removed in order to extend the shower area with glass to brighten the room.
C.	A new bath tub with jets.
D.	The toilet wall was also moved in order to make it wider and bigger.
E.	New cabinets were installed with a frameless big mirror.
F.	New marble tiles 18”x18” for the floor and stone tiles on the walls
g.	New paint on the walls.
H.	New kitchen vent and ducting.
i.	New doors that match the closet.
J.	And of course new fixtures for the kitchen and bathrooms and sink, medicine cabinet and shower areas.
K.	All the appliances (Dishwasher, Refrigerator, Stove and trash compactor including the microwave.
We are more than happy with everything that Eli did for us and we feel lucky to have a contractor that can take a vision and turn it into a reality. Thank you Eli and all the people that did this remodeling.<//text>

<Review>After a while of extensive research in finding for the right contractor or construction company to upgrade our kitchen, we decided based on several reasons to go with SES Builders and we are so glad we did. The reasons that made us hiring this company were: We felt during the meetings that this company is honest, reliable, focus on making the best decisions for the clients and mainly their passion about what they do and provide. Although the results of the remodeling that was done by SES Builders has far exceeded our expectations and goals. Gilli is professional and experience among with his artistic vision was truly amazing. From the moment of listening to what we really want to achieve to the end of the remodeling of the kitchen – not even one item was left uncovered. My favorite feature in the new kitchen is definitely the breakfast area with the gorgeous energy efficient windows including the seating area that overlooks our pool and back yard area.  We really could go on and on with lots of more details and explanations about the attention to detail and amazing design that was done completely by this company, but we rather leave it for others.   Our main recommendation about them is that if you think of hiring someone to remodel anything in your house… Than do yourself a favor and hire SES Builders.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics><date>1522083921383<//date>< GmapID>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Review>We moved back into our home after it was rented for several years. Before we decided to move, we needed to remodel the kitchen, bathrooms, bedrooms and a complete coat of paint on top of a walk in closet. We felt that this remodeling is a big project for us and we wondered who will be the best fit for this work. A friend of us recommended SES builders. During our phone call with Eli, he was able to explain me everything we needed to know about this work and how they work. He then met with us and saw the house and start to come up with his vision of what we can do and how to lower price so we will be within the budget. After we came up with our plan, Eli got his crew and team of professionals together for our big project. During the work, we had weekly meetings with Eli. This ensued that we knew exactly the status of the work and what problems came up and how were they solved. We are happy we made that call to Eli with SES builders. I would most definitely recommend SES builders.< /Review>< pics>

<UserId.>100746315468547871784<//UserId.><Text>I have so many appreciations to SES builders for renovating my back and front yard. Eli and his team of professional have done several remodeling projects at my house before. One of them was demolishing the old driveway and installing a new one at the house, remove old concrete from the back yard, installing a new drainage system and plant 2 trees and lights. From the first meeting with Eli, I had a good feelings that I’m in great hands. Eli is a quick thinker and he understood our goals and what we want to achieve, he was able to take it from that vision and to bring it to reality. While he was at the house during the work of the construction phase, we noticed how important this project was for him and that everything needed to be in perfect finish which this was the main reason why we are satisfied with the final work. When it came to the estimate and prices, Eli made sure that it is very clear and that there are no surprises or hidden items which added so much confident from our side.<//Text><rating>5</rating></record></dataset><record>

<text>We had a great experience working with SES builders! We cannot speak more highly of this company. We wanted to deal with a contractor who we could trust, someone that can guide us through the entire process of the remodeling. We are lucky that we were able to work with Eli as our project manager!! From the moment we met him at our house for the first meeting, he impressed us with his professional and great knowledge. We had the feeling that we will be in good hands because Eli actually care more about his clients and love to help. Eli have a designer's view, so he was an amazing sounding board for us to figure out what we want to remodel and how we would like to see our floor, Kitchen and bathroom. Eli made himself available to us during the whole remodeling process and he always made us feel like we were his top priority. During the work, Eli took an entire day to drive with us to find the wood floor, vanity, tiles, counter tops, appliances, lights and all the hardware for the kitchen. We had no problem at all to reach him via phone or text and always got back to us less than an hour. Eli is a fantastic project manager and he comes with a great team of workers – The foreman Luis was a fantastic. He and his guys worked so hard and so fast, we are so grateful for the amount of care and attention they put into our house. When it came to permits and dealing with the city, SES builders team, Eli got involved to help and expedite everything so there will be no delay in anything. We had a tight timeline of just 1.5 months to complete this remodeling and Eli and the team stayed behind their word and were able to complete it on time! During the remodeling, we added more small things to the remodeling, but we never felt pressured by SES builders or by Eli to do more than we could afford. They were extremely honest about costs and timing and gave us lots of special discounts and threw in extra bonuses to help us out. We are so thankful to SES builders for everything!! If we ever need to do another project, we will definitely work with these guys again!!!<//text><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><GmapID>0x80c299fb55041b21:0x5ee55356f899a668< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Review>I found SES Builders when I was google searching, back in that time they didn't have much reviews but I still decided to ask them for an estimate, since they had amazing pictures of projects they have done. We have finished the project 5 months ago and I have to tell you that this company is just great!!!!! from A-Z, i had 0 concerns and I am so happy with the result I will definitely choose them again in the future when I would like to convert my garage and add an addition to my house.< /Review>< pics>

< Review>
Eli and the crew at SES builders are very professional at what they do!! We had hire them to replace our existing roof and to install a new one in less than a week of daily work. Our roof was in a bad shape and we needed to either replace it or repair it. At the end and after talking to several companies… we made a decision to hire SES builders for that work and more than that, because we were very happy with what we saw… we took another decision and to remodel the kitchen at the house. Eli managed our 2 projects in a very professional and experienced way and he always kept us updated on the progress of the work and also on any problem what came up during the work. There was not even 1 time where we were left thinking what or when anything was about to be done. Perfect communications, service and quality work!< /Review>

After several months of working on a daily basis with Eli and his professional team, I decided to write this review and to express my happiness. Our complete home remodeling project is now completely finish and we could not be happier. Our 4 bedrooms home had a small kitchen and now it become with 5 bedrooms and an amazing Kitchen that we don’t know how we did before this remodeling.  At the beginning, we had only a vision and a small drawings in hand. We had several interviews and meetings with several other contractors. Eli took a quick look at our designs and made a tour at the house in order to see what can he do that will be either better than the designs. At the beginning, Eli shared with us few great ideas that according to him, will improve the overall look of the house. This approach was extremely important and valuable because we wanted the remodel to have some unique features, and his ideas, just did that. We felt that Eli had an instant ownership of our remodeling and he cared a lot about our input and thoughts, but also gave a great direction based on his experience and knowledge. We appreciated that Eli was not bashful about steering us away from a possible bad design decision. Eli kept the remodeling project going and going fast. He made sure to visit the house often and he had a good control on all the work that his workers did. When we reached out with questions and concerns, Eli was very responsive. I was able to be involved in the workmanship of Eli’s team because I spend a lot of time at the house. Eli had a collection of master craftsmen that take a lot of pride in their work and possess great attention to detail. From the first step of demolition, framing, tile installation, kitchen cabinets, painting and all the finish touches, we appreciated the great work that they did. Not only did it feel like Eli’s team worked well together, it helped tremendously that Eli’s team was very courteous and respectful during the 6 month project. We highly recommend SES builders to anyone who wants a unique and well-designed home. We are very proud to say that Eli remodeled our home. Thank you to Eli and his team for helping us re-invent our home.< /Text>

<Review>Perfect quality work for a great price ... and a pleasure company and painters to work with! We hired SES builders to paint the outside of our house last month. The paint work wasn’t an easy project because the house had several cracks and a lot of repairs on the exterior walls and some windows had leaks and needed to be replaced as well. We received several quotes from 5 different companies and SES builders was the best estimate compare to the others. We were very impressed with Eli when we met with him. He was direct and straightforward with lots of knowledge in regards to construction and paint work. So we decided to go with them and we are very glad we did. Because of the problems of the exterior walls of the house, we wanted to take the opportunity of having the scaffolding up to have a contractor check out the front of the house and have all the additional work done as well. Eli told us that he will do that as well without any problem. The windows that we needed to replace, required to remove the old ones, and install a special paper all around and to make sure that they will not leak again. The workers (4 in total) did an awesome work. Eli’s guys worked each day and they made sure that everything is perfect and without any problem. 2 weeks it took them to complete the paint and to install the new windows as well. There was no down time. We were very happy with the quality of SES builders Painting's work. The house looks great. Eli is a pleasure to work with. In addition to having to halt the work for the repairs, we changed our minds about the color of the paint several times and Eli was relaxed and easy going about it all. And the price was right.<//Review>< pictures>

They told me the project would take between a month and a half to two months and initially I expected it would take much longer because a lot of work had to be done. The workers came every day on time and worked very hard. The job was done in literally a month and one week! I still cannot believe how fast it came out and not to mention the amazing job they did! I will never go with another construction company other than SES builders because they are sincere, honest, and most importantly care about the customer's wants and needs. I truly recommend anyone who needs remodeling to go with them!!!!!!</Text>< Date>

<review>Firstime here . Already got price quoted over the phone and brought my wheels and tires to get mounted . Got there early , I was greeted by Eric when he was pushing bikes outside . He was professional and told me rough estimate time . Job it self wasn't hard job , I likes the fact that he came over and ask me if I want them in specific psi . Wheels came out not damaged or scratched . Was in n out in 40mins . I mostly do my own work , but , I will get to share my experiences with my friends and definitely recommend this shop .< /review>< pics>

<Text>Very fast, professional and polite. Called these guys on the word of the owner of quickshift motorsports, after calling four other places that were similarly closed or didn't do tires. I was in and out in around half an hour.

Total charge was $60 for new tires installed, as well as disposal of the old ones and a new valve stem.

I did already have my tires dismounted, so I can't speak as to any price difference if you were to ride up.

Will definitely be returning!< /Text><Gmap_id>0x80dd29c9ef84fd0f:0xe3f1da8aec3978ff<//Gmap_id><resp>None</resp><time>1609885162092<//time>< user_id>

I went there to slap some new skins on my bike, and they didnt fail to mention what my bike was gonna need in the near future, as a heads up! Oh!

< Review>
When I bought my first bike I didn't know what to expect. I blindly bought the first one I saw because of how excited I was. When I started riding I knew I had made a serious mistake. I felt as if my motorcycle wasn't functioning correctly. I went over to Socal Superbike and they took care of me right away. They took a look and gave me their honest opinion. I followed their advise and it felt like a brand new bike. I couldn't believe the change, I felt as if I took a bike off the lot from a dealership. These guys work hard to get your mods and repairs done. Effectively and efficiently. I felt as if I didn't have to worry about anything. Everyone here is honest and I wouldn't think twice to bring it over again. Lifelong customer for me. They care a lot about their people. Every time I come by I get greeted like a friend. I appreciate all the hard work. 10/10 cookouts, nothing but good vibes.< /Review>

<review>My son got his motorcycle serviced here. He was told it was going going to take about 5 hrs it was done is less time!  Alex explained everything he had done  to the bike and what he changed out. He went above and beyond! I highly recommend getting your bike serviced here.< /review><Pics>None<//Pics><gmapID>0x80dd29c9ef84fd0f:0xe3f1da8aec3978ff</gmapID>< Resp>

If I could give them 6 stars it still wouldn't be enough! The staff is very friendly, very knowledgeable and extremely helpful! In my encounters it has been rare to find a mechanic who is more concerned with helping you out than they are with the bottom line and it was a very refreshing experience :)< /Text>

Kinda stumbled upon this place when I needed a new chain/sprocket urgently. I think I made a great choice, definitely returning in the future. Out of my experiences with five other shops in Orange County, I think this place is my new favorite.

I recently got into a pretty bad motorcycle accident and I’m really glad I could turn to this shop. Alex was able to tow the bike from the tow yard to his shop and is working with insurance. Definitely gave me helpful guidance since this is my first accident ever. Really means a lot during these confusing times. Once I’m back on two, I’ll be returning to this place!</Text>

My new go-to place!

Love the atmosphere and what SoCal SuperBikes represents. would definitely take my super bike here, and any bike for that matter, as they have good people that know what they're doing working on your bike with great prices! These guys are truly professionals with experience on street and track and won't try to upsell or push anything you don't need.

The shop is easy to find in an alley with plenty of parking for cars and bikes. lots of little spots nearby to eat and kill time while they work on your bike too.

Will definitely be back for service and anything else I need, or even to come hangout and learn with these guys. Definitely recommend!! Thank you guys.</text>

<Review>This place is a joke... I will never give them my business again.

The guy I talked to said he was an owner.. this frightens me. And the main technician I spoke with tried to sell me parts and a service I JUST had done! These guys are crooks!

Never again...< /Review>< name>

Wow what a great deal and fast shipping! Ordered a full exhaust and a Brembo RCS Corsa Corta. Both came in right before COVID hit and arrived fast and as described. The owner Alex was great to deal with on the phone and I found out he was an Army Veteran which was great because I always try to support small local shops and Veteran owned businesses as much as possible. I know this shop just opened up a month or so ago so they are probably still figuring things out, but very happy with the products I got.</review>

Went for dinner, it was very good.  Our server was very friendly and super helpful.  They have a good well rounded menu with something for everyone.  I loved the garlic bread that was offered for the table a nice touch instead of just plain bread.  The servings were a good size and came from the kitchen poppin hot!  I love to support local businesses and this is a family restaurant that is doing it right.  The menu pricing was very reasonable.  I would definitely go back. Just so you know my 4 star is very very good (I believe 5 star is perfect)</text>

Absolutely delicious! Their lasagna is my absolute favorite. Also, the main item we visit for is their pizza dough! If you’re making your own pizzas at home, head to Nicolino’s to get some of their pizza dough. A size medium is more than enough for two individual sized pizzas and it makes the best pizza’s!!! So delicious!!<//text>

The garlic bread was all oil.  The worst I have ever had.  Yes I have been to Italy... However I have had amazing garlic bread here in the states.  This... wow it’s horrible.  The antipasto salad... well it didn’t come with what it’s said it did.  I feel like Mc Donald’s has better salads... and I do not like Mc Donald’s.  I got iceberg, mushrooms, and a mystery shredded cheese. Almost 30 total... This is not good food.< /text>

Visited on a Thursday early evening. Food was fast and fantastic. Had sauteed mushroom app and a 10 inch pizza. Nikky Special, I think. Mind blown. Service was friendly and attentive. If I'm ever in town again, I'll definitely come back!</text>

OH MY!!!!! The red sauce was, was, was....I have no words of how perfect it was. The garlic bread with the sauce what a combo. I could have stopped at the bread and sauce. What an amazing place.</Review>

Husband and I ate on a whim here last weekend.  We ordered to go and ate in our car. Quite literally the best restaurant Italian I've ever had! We had the spaghetti with the sausage. Already told my husband we have to stop here again when travelling!</Review>

Service was excellent. Mozzarella sticks and garlic bread really good. Fettuccine alfredo was bland. Chicken parmesan was good. Pasta served as side dish was dry. Overall, a decent day but will be apt to try other italian restaurants in the area.<//Text>

<Text>(White) Knight in Shining Armor!

New in town and was tired of cooking.  Found this gem online and am so happy I did.  I ordered the White Knight pizza and it was amazing.  I have been looking for a really good 'white' pizza and they sure delivered (even though I went to pick it up!)  Staff was very friendly and constantly disinfecting the restaurant so I felt safe.  Can't wait to enjoy Nicolino's for a night out once things come back to new normal.  Mangia!</Text>< pics>

<Review>Great food,  excellent service, wonderful charming ambiance! I really enjoyed my meal here! I'll be back,  for sure! Reasonable prices and fantastic food! Outside seating available.  Live music (Wednesday thru Saturday) in the bar area lent to the ambiance. Can't wait to try it again (and again)!< /Review>< rate>

<text>My hubby and I decided to try this place based on the good reviews.   We arrived for an early Friday dinner and the place was busy.  We had the calamari, meat lasagna, 3 course eggplant manicotti dinner and a side of meatballs.  Pros: Good selection and price value for their summer menu.  Their salad, eggplant and sauteed veggies were very fresh and tasty, lots of cheese on their dishes, homemade whipped cream on the strawberry shortcake, and the service was good.  Cons:  Calamari was not fresh but heavily breaded and overcooked, the marinara sauce lacked taste, fresh spices, diced or pureed tomatoes, the Thousand Island dressing was too sweet, garlic bread used oil and not butter, and the meatballs were not homemade but a frozen type.< /text><Date>1561924007492< /Date><Gmap_id>0x80db02d3b6df4277:0xf999d9a151573691</Gmap_id>< rate>

<Text>The ambience was great. The entertainment was great. The food was awful. Coconut shrimp overcooked.  The calamari was overcooked and way too much batter. Supposed to be golden not dark brown. The veal piccata  was soggy and mushy with no lemon piquant.  The waitstaff was amazing. I would get rid of the chefs.</Text><Date>1574136772659<//Date>< UserId.>

Very good food.  Service could be better.  Salad and soup were not served.  When our main course was brought to the table,  we asked about the soup and salad.  Surprised it was not brought out and asked if we still wanted it.  Surprised when we said yes.  It was not included with the dinner price.  Also, water glasses never refilled.  Waitress was very nice but that type of service is not out of the normal for there.</text>

Service and food was superb! My sister and I shared the Florentine with Penne and it was delicious. Very creamy. My husband got the meat lasagna and parents shared the seafood linguine. They all enjoyed their food. I also ordered the Cesar side salad, it was too much dressing for me. My sister ordered the house salad with dressing on the side (better option). And my nephew loved the minestrone soup. Also the garlic bread was yummy. We also ordered a carrot cake and supomani ice cream. Both I highly recommend.< /text>

This place is amazing. The staff greeted us as soon as we walked in. Friendly, calm, and quiet atmosphere. We ordered Friend Mozzarella as an appetizer, it came fast and I've never had such an awesome appetizer before. So so tasty. My wife ordered Spaghetti with meat sauce, I ordered a classic burger with fries. Both of our meals were perfect. I don't have a picture of the burger, but I assure you it was top notch. My wife loved the spaghetti. Their garlic bread is on point as well. I would recommend this place to everyone I know. Thanks to the employees for a great experience.</text>

<Review>Front house is a bar with a dining section and the back is the dining room. The front is totally open and there are booths and tables in the back but they are not positioned to allow any privacy whatsoever. You feel like the wait staff and other customers are watching over you the entire time.  Its not the chef's table!

Free lasagna was pretty good also not homemade by any stretch of the imagination the tiramisu was delicious but for the price expect to pay 75 bucks for two people at lunch.< /Review><pics>None</pics><resp>None< /resp><Gmap_id>0x80db02d3b6df4277:0xf999d9a151573691</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

< review>
A little pricey for a restaurant in Cathedral City, but I'm pretty impressed. Big portions, good food, and friendly service is what I experienced on my first visit and I'm going to come back and try it again. The decor is homey and Italian looking, but a bit worn. It could use a remodel, I think. I don't mind though, I'm here for the food, it the ambiance.</review>

<Text>Just left after waiting two hours and not getting any food. Do not go to this restaurant. Owner Mark recommended we go up the street to Denny's. We have never been so insulted.  Service & attitude is insulting  we had reservations so there was no excuse.   DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AT THIS POOR EXCUSE OF A RESTAURANT!!<//Text>< Pics>

I've been going to Nicolino's since 1997 and Nick makes the best Philly sandwich with the Auju, omg it is the best. Being from Chicago I can't  wait to go back for my birthday on October 18th. It'll be good to see friends of many year's. Can't wait. Glad to hear Nick is back.< /Text>

Smelled great every time I'm here for the chiropractor, so I ordered the god mother sandwich I've heard alot about.... wasnt impressed could get the same "italian" sandwich at the grocery store. Also ordered the nicky special pizza.... also not impressed mediocre at best. I wasnt a " regular" so service was lacking. Save your money and just enjoy the great smells.<//text>

<review>Went here for a quick bite at the bar before going to theater.  Service as great.  Bartender was son of another worker who had been w/Nicolino's for many years.  Pizza was excellent and house wine more than good.  A comfortable local spot with fair prices and good basic fare.</review></record></dataset><record>

Its the most amazing little italian Restraunt in town. I love the atmosphere here. The lighting is very romamtic, the service is superb, and the food is to die for. I had a house salad and pizza. They make their own sauce and dough and they cook it to crisp perfection.. This is highly recommended! Local favorite too!< /Review>

An excellent spot for locals and travelers alike. As a person who travels for work, it's nice to walk into the "local favorite" and instantly be greeted by a smile and excellent service. Obviously the food speaks for itself, but the attention to detail and picturesque charm are really what make this a must.<//review>

I don’t ever give reviews.. but this was over the top- BAD.. I feel compelled. Worst spaghetti ever. Weird diced up sausage that chewed like hot dogs.. I’d give this zero stars if that was an option.. how do you mess up spaghetti? I felt like this was thrown together by some guy that had never been in a kitchen before. Was super disappointing. Sauce was weird too, like spicy and too sweet. Was just the weirdest grossest ever.</text>

We had to ask for water, waited over 20 minutes for our appetizer to arrive, and then the waitress gave us attitude when we asked to have our food boxed for take out (I wasn't feeling well and told her that).  The manager was very friendly and did her best to correct the issue; however, the damage was already done.  Customer service from the waitresses needs work!</Review>

You have to try hard to mess up Italian food and try hard to make it exceptional. They don't try hard! Service slow and inattentive. Prices fair. Decor jaded and in need of refurbishment.< /Text>

I had lunch in Cathedral City with a friend of mine and was excited about how good the food was in the restaurant. I had the meatballs in a bowl and they were light and fluffy and well seasoned. My friend had the spaghetti and it looked fresh and inviting. The feel and taste of the food brought back memories of Old Italy in New York and their restaurant is rustic. They have bistro tables in the bar for those of us with issues getting out of those beastly low chairs. I left happy and talked my partner into ordering a pizza from them for our dinner that night. He got a ham & pineapple pizza and I got their #2 Calzone. When they arrived and we got a look at them the crust was mushy and wet as though it had not been in a hot enough oven. I tired to make excuses like it must of sat on the line before you picked it up, but he had  to wait for it. Then I tried well it must have been the box and the ride home. But, being a chef I know when something isn't cooked correctly. We were highly disappointed with their take away pizza and calzone. I ate half of mine and just heated the other half up in the oven for lunch. Admittedly with a little more heat it tasted much better and wasn't as mushy as the first go a-round. I'll hesitate ordering a take out pizza/calzone from them in the future. I'll visit for lunch and see if they can kick-start this relationship again. They have been a cornerstone of the community for 40 years I believe I read. Common guys! Pay attention and don't take advantage of the love we give you.<//Text>

We waited 1 hour for our food.  They forgot half of our food. We eat there often. This was the worst experience.  And it was our daughters birthday. And when we talked to the owner she did not care and was having a drink at the bar. We will not go back and we will not recommend to other people.<//Review>

Decent food, but they messed up the spicy level on my wife's dish and left the spice out of my dad's, and the dinner moved a little slow overall. +1 for Sinatra as the bg music.  And +1 for very friendly staff.  A good, red sauce kind of Italian restaurant. Thinking about the meal honestly, I will probably pick other places to try before returning here the next time I'm in town.  So going with 3 stars.  Had the order come out exactly right, and a touch faster, I might have gone to 4.<//text>

<review>Love Nicolino's and have been coming here for about 20 years. Food is consistantly good. Was a bit disappointed my last visit as I ordered chicken parmigiana and recieved veal. Didn't bother sending it back as there were four in our party and I didn't want to hold everyone up.<//review>< Date>

If you want to dine and/or hope to enjoy hearing Bill Lohnes serenade you on a Saturday evening, you seriously might want to have a reservation booked the Wednesday before. The food and service are wonderful as well and I won't be surprised if one has to make a reservation earlier.</Text>

Terrible calamari--severely breaded and straight from the freezer.  Burnt lasagna.   Seriously over-priced wine.  Although--surprise, surprise--the music was very good.</text>

<Review>Go to Mario's for a much much better deal. Food was pretty good but the portion sizes OMG. Spent $18 on chicken picatta and the chicken was separate from a TINY side of pasta. Maybe 5 bites- literally. I ordered carrot cake for desert ($6.50!) and it was TINY. Literally an inch wide at the crust. It looked good but I couldn't pay almost $30 for a meal that left me HUNGRY so I just told them I didn't want it. Bread took forever that waiter kept making different excuses for. Drinks were flat and again, everyone's plates were tiny portions. A male in our party was very upset. He ate his plate, filled up ok bread, my daughter's entire children's plate and another children's leftovers just to get his fill. I was expecting a plate of pasta (I know, how dare I) but instead got a high bill and no food. Two thumbs down.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

I had heard great things about this place. I've eaten here once before this visit and the food was satisfactory and the service spotty.  On this occasion I called to place an order for a hot sandwich to go.  The girl/woman who answered the phone had no idea what a meatball parmigiana  sandwich/hero was and I needed to explain it to her.  After the suggested 15 minutes I went in to pick up my order to be told it hadn't been sent to the kitchen yet because nobody knew what I wanted. Perhaps calling the phone number I gave would have been the correct thing to do?  I explained it AGAIN and it was given to me 10 minutes later.  No apology for the delay, no thank you for my business.  On tap of that it took another 7 or 8 minutes to get someone to run my debit card.  I got home and had a sausage and pepper sandwich (without any cheese, not that it mattered at this point)!  I just gave up and threw it away I was so pissed off.  There are Italian restaurants around run by non-Italian owners and staff that afford me much better service, pay attention to their food orders and care about their customers.  I wouldn't go back if they offered free food for life.  HORRIBLE experience.<//Text>

it's been around for a long time, and the food is ok.  Sometimes they have pretty good deals.

I went here again and the food was horrible and I was treated very rudely...all i asked was for them to reheat lasagna because it was super cold in the middle (so ridiculous)<//Text>

This is a nice place to come to get your hair cut. There’s so many people that come here it’s on the walk in basis. So I’m your name inside and wait they only take cash< /review>

<text>Been coming here in and off since I lived in the San Mateo area. I recently moved to San Jose and have recently come back during the pandemic to get cuts here and it's always worth the extra drive. Gloria is very professional and very easy to talk to. It's a relaxing environment and she makes you feel very comfortable. Even during the pandemic and all the strict guidelines that are presented, she follows them in accordance and makes you feel safe. Highly recommend to anyone near or far!</text><pics>None< /pics><resp>None<//resp><gmapID>0x808f9e7a7e58a53b:0x315dd494b9d4c98e<//gmapID></record>

<Review>FANTASTIC experience. Walk-ins welcome so they are great in a pinch, do require cash only but it's fine because it's what I do normally anyways. Gloria always makes sure you're comfortable and happy and has the best time you can. I don't know the guy's name but if you're going to get a haircut from All Star I would recommend not getting him. Works way too fast and doesn't pay attention to details. Love this place and will be my future barber :)< /Review></record></dataset><record>

Disappointing is an understatement. It was a Saturday and I was in urgent need of a trim. Unfortunately my regular barber was unavailable this weekend and I had to settle for an alternate. One stylist with a walk in basis is how this barbershop was functioning on Saturday evening which was just not efficient, but I decided to wait and take the plunge.

I requested for a fade on my sides with a one and two clipper while the top to have the hair length from a three clipper with more hair in the front for styling. Nothing was achieved . The haircut was bland and for 30$ there was absolutely no styling, no fading , or any sharpness in the cut. Might as well gone to supercut or similar.

The other thing which irked me was the way the clippers, scissors, brushes, etc. were not sanitized between clients. They are all kept in a bunch on the table behind the barber who takes and uses as needed. I had a beard trim along with the haircut and hair from the clipper went into my eyes, only god knows whose hair that was. Also, my beard trim resulted in removal of most of my beard, which was clearly adding salt to an already badly injured wound.

Wish they have more barbers/stylists or provide appointments which would be more efficient. Also, wish sanitary standards are not compromised!

2 stars only for the hot towel at the end.

Not going to head here again but thankfully it's just hair and it will grow back!<//Review>

<review>Say hello to Gloria while she cuts your hair. She is friendly, upbeat and does a great job as a barber. After your haircut she places the warm moist towel on my head which is a nice way to end it.</review><GmapID>0x808f9e7a7e58a53b:0x315dd494b9d4c98e< /GmapID><rating>5</rating><Time>1573457092428</Time>< name>

Great place to get a haircut and beard trim. The wait is usually short too.</Review>

Gloria has been cutting my hair now for about a year. She does an excellent job. I have sent my friends and family members here and everyone loves her. Good quality and only $20. I will keep coming here and will keep promoting her business because it's probably the best barber shop in the peninsula do to the price and my sexy hair cuts I get every 3 weeks. Come on down ladies and gentleman, you got to meet Gloria. Great barber and person.</review>

<text>Gloria is great - fast, consistent haircuts, at a reasonable price. She also does straight-razor shaves, which I treat myself to from time to time.

I've moved a few miles away, but haven't been willing to roll the dice on a new barber.

Cash-only, so I have to remember to hit the ATM before I go.<//text>< pics>

The last and only place I will get my haircut!  The best cut in the peninsula, worth the short wait & price.  I've had $50 and $10 haircuts at other places which I regret.  Even when I change my style here they won't let me leave with a bad haircut...simply the best.< /text>

one barber 4 customers. on a friday you know you will be busy why not have the right coverage. hair cut was basic. i  think the price was not worth the haircut. 25$ for a fade. dont understand the people rating this place so high they must never never been to a true barbershop. just because ypure store front says barbershop that doesnt make you one. it was more like a supercuts.</Text>

<text>I went in to get a haircut l. Had to wait for 2 hours. Thought it was worth it but it was not. I was trying to get a clean/professional cut. She was not taking her time with my hair. Guess she was in a hurry. I don't blame her though, she's the only one working there. Left long hairs all over. Tapers were horrible. The fade was the worst. Uneven fade; one side was higher. The other side had a bump. If your looking for a clean/professional cut, this is not the place to go to. Not worth the $25.</text><gmap_id>0x808f9e7a7e58a53b:0x315dd494b9d4c98e</gmap_id>< Date>

Friendly barber, with authentic conversations when you want them, and nothing else when you don't. Parking is a struggle sometimes, so plan accordingly.The foam, shave and hot towel at the end doesn't hurt either :)

To sum it up for you: Cash Only, Walk-in friendly, $20, Good folks!<//Review><resp>None<//resp><username>Tyler Harding</username><UserId.>110357160824479158301<//UserId.><Pics>None< /Pics>< Date>

I took my 1 year old for her first dental appointment and it was an awesome experience. The office was recommended by neighbors on Next Door app. The staff was fabulous and the dentist was so great with my daughter. They had a lot of great advice and gave encouragement as well. They also explained everything that would be happening. My daughter especially loved the Princess room she was placed in. I’m glad I went and will be using this office for all my daughter’s dental needs. I wish i had a dentist like that growing up!< /text>

We had such an amazing experience at Smile Kingdom. From the billing coordinator at the front counter, to the dental hygienist, to the Dentist himself - everyone was so professional, kind, helpful, and caring. I just transferred my daughter from another kids dentistry that had a really cool playroom and playground, Smile Kingdom definitely had cool elements for kids, but no playground. I was worried my daughter would be disappointed about not being able to play after her visit, but instead she said she loved this dentists office and the people so much she didn’t care about the playground. This was also my little guys first trip to the dentist and he loved it too! He left with a big smile and can’t wait to come back. My daughter even woke up today and said she felt what the dentist told her was true, and she needed to make more of an effort to brush her teeth at night. I was shocked! At the end, they even gave me a couple recommendations for adult dentists in my area. It’s hard to tell after just one visit, time will tell if this is standard for Smile Kingdom, but as of right now - I am hugely impressed and would recommend Smile Kingdom to anyone - especially to those with kiddos that fear or have anxiety about going to the dentist. They really have a heart for kids - and you can’t fake that.</Text>

We had a great experience here. Brought our 4 year old daughter for her first dental visit. She was very nervous but the staff did amazing with her. Explained everything and let her touch the instruments and see how they get before they used them. She did so amazing and it was all because Dr J and the staff were so gentle and sweet to her!<//Text>

This was the best experience my kids could have at the dentist. All the employees were great with children, communicate well with adults, and really showed care and pride in their work. We were thrilled with the service we got and my kids were asking to go back to the dentist.< /review>

<Text>I have taken all three of my little ones here and it has always been an amazing experience. Dr. J was incredibly patient with my 2 year old, and explained what he was doing in terms she could understand. With my 10 year old twin boys he explained what was going on directly to them and then discussed options with me. I love that he doesn't push to do more treatments than necessary and that he is strong on preventive care. My one son did need a couple of fillings, which ended up being a positive experience for him, which is fantastic! The kids love going to the dentist and my little one often asks to go see the dragon doctor!

I also have to mention that the front desk help is amazing, they are always polite and very caring!< /Text>< Pictures>

Took our daughter to her first dentist appointment and we definitely chose the right place! Walking in to the office was like walking into a fairy tale 😀. From the flying dragon, treasure chests and different rooms w/in the castle.

They did a geat job balancing a fairy tale theme and modern day technology to help your child feel at ease. I must say, my daughter's first visit was a success!

The staff is very warm and friendly. Dr. J is very patient, kind, knowledgeable and professional. I highly recommend Dr. J and his staff at Smile Kingdom!< /review>

<review>I'm really grateful for the time that was put into my son's care by everyone in this office. He had fallen while walking his bike and knocked one of his front teeth out. Since my son is two, I was a wreck! It will literally take years for a new tooth to grow in and it was a painful experience for him.

Dr. J literally was my first choice. We had seen him at iFest and his balloon animals were memorable, but his reviews speak for themselves. He was the quickest Doctor to get back to me personally and set up an appointment. With the help of his wonderful staff of course! He was more thorough over the phone then the ER doctor was in person, right after the accident. We were in good hands. Same for our visit today. I'm so sad for the outcome (one less tooth), but I'm thankful that Dr. J talked me out of getting an expensive replacement that wouldn't work out in the end. This office is not out for your money. They are there because they are passionate about caring for children.

Getting the best care is number one to me. Respect for children comes in second and everyone we came in contact with loves and respects the kids that come into their office. Nothing was forced and nothing was rushed. Everything was on my son's terms and if something didn't work, we tried something else so that my son could feel comfortable. He cried tonight when bedtime came around because we couldn't go back to Dr. J's castle until next month.

It's not just a fun place with balloons, toys, and decorations... (Although that made it so fun and it was really beyond cool!) It's quality care and I'm so glad we got the help we needed. I know my son is in great hands and we already scheduled our next appointment. Thanks so much!</review>< Pictures>

Dr. J and his staff are excellent with kids! My son has white coat syndrome and was very mistrustful of anyone touching him. I appreciated Dr. J’s slow approach to gain trust before doing any work. We are half way through the treatment and my son is actually looking forward to his next appointment! I highly recommend Smile Kingdom!

Adored our visit here!  My kids have had some really rough and honestly traumatizing experiences with their previous dentist.  Dr. J and his staff are all so kind, patient, and sincerely caring.  They explained everything to my very nervous and anxious 4 year old, took everything at her pace, and were so sweet to her.  It’s obvious from every aspect of my interactions with this office that they care a lot about children.</review>

Excellent staff and Dr. J  is so patient and provides gentle care.  We have worked with Dr. J for may years and refer many pediatric patients for dental care to Smile Kingdom. My nephew sees Dr. J, he is 3 years old and loves  the office, it is very kid friendly. I would recommend this office without hesitation to all families looking for a top notch children's dental office.<//text>

My daughter was deathly afraid of the dentist after multiple bad experiences at another office. I warned Dr. Juarez and his staff, and they COMPLETELY turned my daughters outlook of the dentist around. Even with getting some heavy dental work done, she was giggling through it. They take the necessary time needed with each patient, we feel welcomed every visit, no wait time, after each visit we get a call to check on the patient and won't go anywhere else!<//Text>

<Review>We've been to Smile Kingdom twice now and love it. My kids love going there- ages 4 and almost 2. A very kid-friendly and fun environment. Dr. Juarez is patient and kind and when my toddler was feeling uneasy and uncomfortable, he sang to him during the entire cleaning. My 1 year old, who normally strongly protests having his teeth brushed or even looked at, even let Dr. Juarez scrape off some tartar build up with the scraping tool, all the while being serenaded by the doc. A very positive experience, we highly recommend Smile Kingdom.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

I had an emergency with my grandson who is eight years old.  The Dentist called me back after hours and had me in the next morning.
Pulled the tooth and fixed the problem
He was so caring and really wanted the best for my grandson
I highly recommend Smile Kingdom</review>

On January 18th, 2019, I had an appointment for my 4 year daughter at 2pm. We arrive a couple minutes early, and my daughter was so eager to get inside she couldn't wait for me to park. My daughter never liked doctors or dentists but last time when she went here at age 3 and a half she was SOOOO good. She sat in the chair and let the dentist do whatever he wanted, I even have pictures. My daughter had a very normal morning and didn't exhibit any moodiness to me. I however am 38 weeks pregnant with Hyperemesis and recently had a fall so I gashed open my toe and split the skin open completely. From the day of the appointment I was walking around 3cm dilated and was scheduled to be induced 5 days from that Friday. Im nauseous and limping without a shoe on trying to wrap my foot, and they dont ask me if I'm okay or if I need anything. An overly "energetic" employee comes out and asks my daughter for a picture and that's when the meltdown begins. My daughter knows that they take pictures and they check teeth, after all she's done this since she was 1, but for some reason she was upset (go toddlers!). We go back to the chair and the unnecessarily high pitched employee keeps talking to her like how id talk to my dog, and it visibly made her more and more upset. I at that point was ready to just reschedule, I was unsure why my daughter all of a sudden got so upset and I am currently dealing with a lot of physical issues so I didn't have the time or patience to deal with it. What I wanted for my daughter was to be removed from the situation that's causing her frustration and harm (The dentists office and employees) and just try again another day. They decide to take her back to some "princess room" without asking me or my husband, and I'm hesitant to allow this to continue because I know my own daughter, she was not going to just be okay with the situation and I had no way of fixing it because I was not sure exactly what was wrong, but I knew that the employees are the ones that initiated her tears and her being upset. We get to the room and she's just clearly not having anything to do with these people or having them check, she is old enough to explain herself and let me know what's going on but clearly didn't feel comfortable with them and I was about to reschedule when the doctor cones in. My husband is holding her down in his lap as directed as they chant over her while she's screaming bloody murder begging to be "helped" and promising shell "listen" if they stop. At this point the whole situation was completely abusive and I had trouble even sitting there listening to it. I mean with a toddler in a position she's in while people are chanting over her, it really felt like a sacrifice or a cult ritual, yes--it was that bad. So he says he checked her teeth and she has no cavities, and our disaster of a visit would have been over, except Dr. J decided to put me and my husband down as parents. He decided to tell us, inappropriately and without permission, that he believes her behavior was "completely okay" and essentially told me how to parent my child and justified his reasoning because he "has 4 children" and that means he's all of a sudden a god? I kindly let him know that I appreciated him checking my daughters teeth, but that he has crossed a line and did not need to mention anything related to my parenting, and I also let him know that he has no idea what its like to grow a child, as I'm sitting here trying not to vomit with my gashed open toe and having minor contractions on and off. When I told him essentially that his opinion on my parenting was unwanted his facial expression changed and he was angry.

Her first visit at smile kingdom dental was so exciting she wanted to dress up like a princess to match their theme and the entire staff were just amazing and kind and they helped her have fun.  From picking her favorit flavor of tooth polish to haveing fancy pink sunglasses to wear during her exam!  They have baloones as a prize and Dr J even made her a baloon animal on one of her visits. We a very lucky to be right down the street from them but I would travel a long way to get the wonderful care we receive every time we come in.  My daughter was so excited to earn a gold coin for not having any sugar bugs to use in their great prize tower too!  Her only compliant is that she has to wait 6 months between visits! I would and do recommend smile kingdom dental to my friends!<//Text>< pics>

We always enjoy our time and meals here. My son and I used to come here twice a month after music class until covid hit. Glad we're able to support this amazing establishment again. Highly highly recommend, and the owner has always been meticulous about cleaning and providing excellent customer service. I felt very safe dining here<//review>

Hope I can take more pictures there, too many people. I ordered a cup of coffee latte with chocolate croissant. Coffee has a rich flavor such as hazelnut, and the croissant is really good if it could be reheating will be better.<//Review>

< Review>
Food: 4 Stars
Ambiance: 4 Stars (Casual but clean)
Service: 2 Stars...the owner is really friendly and attentive but I've found on numerous occasions that the staff are just slow and somewhat oblivious. Despite the fact that it's a small cafe and not too many tables to serve, consistently see that they seat people slowly, miss bringing menus, don't refill coffee or water...the list goes on and on.

Would I come back? Yes, for the food and the owner and the fact that it's the only spot within walking distance of where I get my oil changes and tire rotations.

However, I really wish the owner would address the staff's lackadaisical attitude. In a way I can't fault the owner since it seems it's just hard to get good help these days.</Review>

I use to frequent this cafe (same business name with different owner) on a weekly basis during the late 90's, this establishment use to serve the best omelets and sourdough bread/toast.

So fast forward to today we went in with low expectations but somehow we still left disappointed. Service was subpar, unenthusiastic waitress whom didn't bother to refill our tiny glasses of water during the entire meal. Food was terrible, if an American cafe/diner is incapable of preparing a simple omelet or canned corn beef hash or pancakes.... it's time to close the doors or revamped the concept and menu.<//Text>

This is a fairly average diner. The service was pretty good, but the food is fairly nothing special. I've only tried a couple of the breakfast dishes. If I were in the area looking for breakfast, I would go here, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it.<//review>

<response>None</response><date>1523136061449</date><text>A favorite place for breakfast for my wife and I. I go here more often on my way to work for the delicious breakfast burrito. To me, it's huge, so I can have half for breakfast and the other half for lunch. If I don't get take out, I would usually order the Hillsdale omelette. It's so good, you don't want to add condiments to it. My wife enjoys their 2 egg with linguica. She can be very critical of how linguica is made and gives this place a thumbs up!

The staff is always very friendly, welcoming, and accommodating. The place is always spotless too! With all that said, I'm glad it's always easy to find seating here. Absolutely recommend!< /text><name>John Mangahas</name>< UserId.>

Food is good slow pace so if your in a hurry or don't have time to stop and smell the roses you may want to go somewhere else.
But if you need to chill and relax definitely this is the place.</Review>

< Review>
Patio Coffee Shop is a favorite of locals.  It's not fancy, but it's comfortable and the people are always friendly, staff and patrons alike.  I appreciate that it's one of a kind and not a knock-off of every other coffee shop around.  Parking on 25th can be dicey at shopping hours, but there's always plenty on the side streets. The restaurants and retail shops here project a similar idiosyncratic but quality character.  25th Avenue is one of San Mateo's oldest and most genuine neighborhoods, with a warm ambience that reflects the homeyness of this part of town.</Review>

Went there expecting a good meal came out with buyers remorse this was by far the worst meal I ever had in my life. I would never go back to this place again. I ordered a ham and cheese omelet there was little to no ham and the portions were lacking and it tasted heavily of alcohol and the coffee was terrible. To top it off the service was lacking as well. I don't understand how these people are still in business with such terrible food. oh well maybe I just went on a bad day but I'll never try again I hope other people have better luck.< /text>

First time trying this place out, called to get a quote and the quality of the customer service on the other end convinced me to come in.

Good value and service, although I'm a bit disappointed they put in regular oil instead of full synthetic without asking. I assumed they'd ask what you wanted, but I guess that's my fault for telling them explicitly...<//text>

Shop it self was really slow workers and dirty I went to get my oil change and my car had oil spills everywhere not to mention the mechanics do not pay attention or importance who is coming in or letting u know that they will be with you in a minute. I waited for a really good amount of time until  some one talked to me.

For me service was 2 out of 5. For some one that worked in your company before its really disappointing how management is on this store.</Text>

I could tell I was getting a quality experience from a team with interfaith from the moment I arrived. And given that I left an oil change with a book recommendation, can honestly say I had fun.

< Review>
Hit and miss here. Had good experience prior 5 months ago but last time,  6 weeks or so ago, miserable experience. Had to wash the grease off my truck straight away. Lead told me, after providing my own fluids, I  was a 1/4 low and should add. Turns out he meant 1/4 below oil limit. Employees make or brake the business in the service industry. I initially gave them 4 stars. 2 trips, 50/50, I now believe they're a solid 2.< /Review>

———

Went there on Thursday for an oil change to my Audi diesel, came out this morning to my car on the minimum amount of oil and it’s leaked out all over my garage floor. I almost slipped trying to get to the front to look at the dip stick level.

Thought I’d give them another try but will never go there again. Last time, before this, I went for an oil change and a few weeks later took my car to the dealership to have them fix an oil leak problem ... ended up being the oil cap being broken from this place! We had to spend $780 since they had to take the entire engine out to find the problem!!!

We are definitely going back tonight to get our money back, have them fix the leak they created and more oil put in since we’re out!!!< /text><rating>5<//rating></record>

Quick and easy. Stayed in car.
I just needed an oil changes they also said I needed powered steering fluid so they ripped it off. They answered questions I had about fuel additive.

Fist time here and I have to say I was very impressed. Very good communication the whole time and no hard upselling going on. It's a very transparent process  as they tell you everything they are doing along the way. There was only one vehicle ahead of me and the wait was only about 10 minutes before they had me in and were working on my car. You sit in your vehicle the whole time the service is happening,  it couldn't be any easier.  Also took advantage of the carwash they have there as well.

Because of all the smoke that we had in the air I decided to get the cabin air filter changed as well. Glad I did the old one was filthy!</review>

<Text>A friend of mine takes her car there regularly.  The last time they changed the oil the guy didn’t thread the plug in correctly.  Lots of oil leaked and her car never leaks oil.  They told her it was normal wear and tear.  The only way oil leaks from the plug is if they damaged the threads on the pan.  It’s not hard to thread the plug in correctly unless you’re in a hurry to get the next car in.  Now they won’t take responsibility for their mistake.  So far they haven’t accepted responsibility to replace her oil pan.  You can’t just put in a bigger plug.  This from a place that changes oil for a living.< /Text><pics>None<//pics>< response>

A friend of mine takes her car there regularly.  The last time they changed the oil the guy didn’t thread the plug in correctly.  Lots of oil leaked and her car never leaks oil.  They told her it was normal wear and tear.  The only way oil leaks from the plug is if they damaged the threads on the pan.  It’s not hard to thread the plug in correctly unless you’re in a hurry to get the next car in.  Now they won’t take responsibility for their mistake.  So far they haven’t accepted responsibility to replace her oil pan.  You can’t just put in a bigger plug.  This from a place that changes oil for a living.</text>

I've been going here for a while. Good service. Sometimes there's a backup of cars during popular times of day but they move along quick and are always helpful. =)
Update: so this time I went in because my car was reporting my tire pressure was low and I was due for an oil change anyway. As it turned out, my cute tire valve covers with the paw prints on them had rusted and fused with my tire valves. (Only use plastic covers, I had no idea) One of the valves broke when they tried to remove it requiring me to use a spare until it was fixed. They switched to my spare for me, filled up the pressure on my spare, and are getting the tire fixed at Firestone no charge to me. The guy noticed there's a screw in that tire so it was the reason for the low pressure. He's having that fixed too and I can just pay for it when getting my tire back. They're making a frustrating situation very easy for me. I had to reschedule my plans for the day because I was about to drive an hour and a half which I can't do on a spare but I also wouldn't have wanted to do that with a screw in my tire and that's my fault for going in right before a planned long drive anyway. ... Anyways, good job guys.</review>

<Review>Took my car there for an oil change. The only nearby place that was open on a Sunday.

The cashier asked me whether my car uses synthetic oil or regular and i told him that it’s regular so he gave me a quote for that. While getting the oil changed they checked the brake lights and filled up the fluids.

I asked the dude if he could fill up the windshield wiper fluid since my car is showing a warning for low wiper fluid and he said he will.

When i got the bill i noticed that i got charged for synthetic oil even though they put regular oil and i explicitly told the cashier that it’s regular oil. Maybe an honest mistake so i didn’t mind.

While waiting for the dude to correct the bill i noticed that the windshield wiper fluid warning light is back on even though he said he filled it up. I brought it to his attention and he was sure he filled it up and it must be a “leak”. Anyway he filled it up for me “again” and it’s been a month and it hasn’t shown me the warning again. So i assume the “leak” fixed itself.

Overall it was a mediocre experience and i wouldn’t go back unless i really wanted an oil change on a Sunday.<//Review><gmap_id>0x808f7a341de92a7d:0xfca1ba3d9880396c</gmap_id><Pics>None</Pics>< user_name>

<text>Great and fast service. Best place in the bay. These guys are efficient and I didn’t even have to make an appointment. They took the time to explain other concerns I was having with my vehicle too. I really recommend this team if you’re looking for a place that’s reliable and thorough, and doesn’t make getting your regular car upkeep a tedious adventure.</text>< Pics>

I like that its like a really drive through, you stay in your car while they work on your car.  They show you how much oil is at your car, they check your breaks, lights, and adjust the air on your tire.  Super quick, it took about 15-20 minutes.    I would definitely come back here again.  I don't feel like I'm being rip off and they just give you their suggestions without feel any pressure or attempt to buy extra items.  Great honest customer service.< /review></record>

Not only was the staff friendly and efficient, but they offered advice about fluid, air filter changes, etc. without trying to up-sell me.  Being able to stay in the car makes the whole process comfortable.  Even driving to this location was a scenic experience.  Next time I need an oil change, I won’t put it off until it’s overdue—I look forward to returning.<//Text>

I have been coming to this Oil Changers for approximately two years.  Knowledgeable staff and they do a great job.  This evening my check engine light came on.  Despite the rain I was told they could assist me.  Michael and Rich hooked a diagnostic tool to my car and gave me the code which is a huge help.  Outstanding service.  This is why I give them my business.  A big shout out to Michael and Rich.< /text>

These guys are simply the best. Total professionals, and they get it done. Friendly, funny, hard working. Good communication between service members, and totally efficient in their work. No wasted time or movements. Always straight up, never trying to pull a scam or get extra money. What you ask for is what you get. I had 2 cars in front of me, and I was still out in less than 20 minutes. I brought in my Ford Mustang and these guys took care of the rest. Never going to Speedy Oil Change again. These guys are faster, nicer, and total professionals. For a simple oil change, it was quite the pleasant experience. Whoever hired these guys created an excellent team. I don't do reviews, but these boys deserved one. 💪 -Miles</Text>

Excellent service by Kareem and Lorraine (I believe that is her name). Lorraine did an excellent job explaining everything that she was doing throughout the oil change.  She also explained everything in detail for the other services that were recommended for my car.  She was very professional - so was Kareem.  I highly recommend this location.<//review>

This place by far supersedes other fast oil changing places. Quick service, educational, professional and very highly motivated personal. Prior service will be proud. My van at 9ft tall cleared height restrictions. Has a pit, rather than a lift.</Text>

My experience regarding my oil change was as it usually is.  Prompt attention paid to both myself and my car.  All questions answered & issues addressed.
After all was taken care of, however, an incident occurred when trying to remove the notification of "Change Oil Soon" which was still showing up on the Instrument Panel.   Michael, was extremely helpful, positive, calm & researched the problem at hand.  He along with the rest of the crew solved the situation with courtesy & patience.
For this I am extremely grateful & send out a huge amount of applause to all who were involved.<//Review>

Awesome, affordable and efficient service. These guys know their stuff. Came in for a huge service interval consisting of: crankcase fluid change, oil change, multi point inspection, fluid top off, filter changes and inspection. Usually a standard jiffy lube wouldn’t know what the heck they are doing but these guys know their stuff.

Come by and enjoy their awesome service you won’t regret it. They take your requests and needs for your vehicle maintenance seriously.<//Review>

Everybody who works here are completely professional and hardworking. I’ve never seen a team work so hard to get people out fast with excellent customer service during the process. They are very friendly and get the job done! The manager who runs the store must be doing a very good job because that is one of the tightest shops being run in that whole area. Thank you Oil Changers!</text>

Professional, Fast, friendly, and knowledgeable. These guys are top notch and worked great together as a team. I felt like I had my own pit crew as they checked the tire pressure, changed the oil, air filter, cabin air filter, and safety check of all the lights.  In and out in a flash!</Text>

This morning I went to Oil Changers, and it was fast and efficient. Great staff and knew what they were doing. They helped change oil, air filter, and wipers upon my request. Great! Great! Great! Surpassed expectations!< /review>

Please be aware that although you go in for an oil change they will offer you other services that they find May benefit your vehicle. I like this place better than the speedy franchise because the latter Cuts corners and you not always get Quality.<//text>< Pics>

Came here because of the reviews and these guys lived up to the hype! In the service industry it's either you get disgruntled d-bags or what I got from this place - professional and on top of their game. Lots of communication between the team... great synergy. Very thorough and helpful. Highly recommend!< /text>

Quick oil change, friendly staff and you don't have to leave your car! I gave 4stars because I often have to wait in line for about 20 mins before getting my in the service bay. But since I'm in the car, I'm relatively entertained, so it's not so bad. Also have an automated car wash on site.< /text>

<Review>I was really impressed at how quick and efficient these guys are. They are also very orderly which I admired. They verbally go over every single thing they’re checking on your car with you as they are checking it. The oil changes are pretty pricey but I prefer being in the car as they are working on it as opposed to just dropping off the car and wondering if it was ever touched.</Review>< Date>

These guys are Great! I went in with my son’s  vehicle, I couldn't find the lights or how to open the hood but, they were very helpful and very kind. We just purchased this vehicle and the previous owner used to go there they explained that the vehicle was very well taken care of. They were so sweet when I didn't know my left from my right as well. We will be continuing to service our new vehicle here because of the great service. Thanks guys see you for our next service!< /text>

Stopped here really late... (1/2 hr before closing), and these guys had the best attitude for being the end of the day. They took me in and got me out in 30 min, which was GREAT! They’re very thourough and never pressured me into buying extra stuff. They did suggest that I pay attention to future services that my car would need which was very helpful. The location is great and I loved the Price too. Thanks!</Review>

<Review>Will not be using this service ever again !!! they made a huge mess  under truck by pressurizing with a loose oil filter , then spilled oil all over engine compartment and didn't even attempt to clean it up (everyone laughed )
HAHAHA now the truck is dripping so it looks like there is a leak but i do not trust you and will have to pay another shop to change filter and do another oil change  HORRIBLE

Doing so in a polite manner even when I said no to everything was appreciated.  The best part they had enough employees in the middle of the day to get me in and out in no time.  I would recommend going to this location in the middle of the day to reduce wait time to a minute or 2.<//review><gmapID>0x808f7a341de92a7d:0xfca1ba3d9880396c< /gmapID>< user_name>

<review>A crew of three dynamic, energetic and friendly guys completed an oil change on my car this afternoon. I felt like I was in some kind of drill, but a friendly drill. They checked all fluids, filters and lights as they whirled around my car. Discovered terribly clogged air filters, remnants from the horrendous Camp fire in November. I was still breathing that air. They replaced them in seconds. Outstanding service! You guys were fantastic.< /review>< Pictures>

I love that you stay in your car since I usually have my dogs with me. Prices are fair and the guys working there are very nice and friendly. Their services are limited, though (have to special order air filters and can't change a headlight)<//Review>

Been coming here since I got my first car, and they have been okay, but they consistently put different types of oil in my car everytime I go in, it's never the same kind twice in a row. Which isnt exactly manufacturer recommended. This most recent time I went in, it seems like they lost one of the caps for a fluid reservoir, and instead just put a rubber glove on it before sending me on my way.  It's now bone dry and my car is not running normal, so probably never going back.< /text>

The crew at this location is solid (now, as of today and also in the distant past). They are very thorough, detailed and professional. These guys are very clear about what their services are, what they need to do and what they will be doing once you decide what you're going to need for your car. They are also incredibly transparent about what the prices are for everything. Also, if you don't choose to get a car wash after your oil change, they clean all your windows for you! I have been a customer here for almost 15 years, bringing several different makes and models of vehicles for services. These guys do a terrific, consistent job EVERY time and always give the best customer service. No bad attitudes, or rude behavior EVER. And to top it all off, they are FAST! Not rushed and sloppy, but super quick and efficient! They will upsell other recommended services, but are not pushy at all. I will certainly be back when it's time again. Thanks for always doing a great job, Oil Changers crew on Westborough!< /Review>

<Text>I was told that there were a bunch of kids that work here and don't expect too much, be wary of them tightening the drain plug without a torque wrench and snapping off the clips to your air filter.  Yes, a bunch of kids work there, but they used a torque wrench, and didn't break a clip. They were also courteous, professional and did the job quickly. I'll go back, but I won't go late on a Friday afternoon, after all a bunch of kids work there... doing excellent work.< /Text>< user>

They are so fast, friendly, and polite. They put air in my tires cleaned windows and refilled my fluids that were low without even asking. I got my oil changed transmission fluids replaced and cabin and air filters and fuel system serviced and coolant all replaced and it only took about 30 minutes!!! HOW AWSOME WAS THAT!!!! My car that has 167k miles now drives like a brand new car! I will definitely be back soon. And the boss Kareem is so awsome with such a professional crew! Thank you oil changers.<//review>

Location and layout is inconvenient, employees are polite and efficient but are slightly undertrained (had to reset my own oil light and show them how to find my transmission fluid) and they can't do the transmission fluid on some vehicles. You should definitely skip the car wash unless you're sure there's not much of a line, as the parking lot is not suited to accommodating a line of any length to speak of and they are unable to refund you should you change your mind.< /Review>

I'm not a car expert, but I also don't like having someone swindle me just because I don't know much. I switched to Oil Changers after a hefty, unexpected price tag at Jiffy Lube on King Drive in Daly City. After switching to Oil Changers, I come back every couple months to basically get an oil change. The last time I was here was last month and service was excellent. Not only did they change my oil, but they also pumped my tires and refilled the wiper fluid reservoir. They also tell you everything that they're doing on your car and inform you of any fluids/filters you may/may not want to change.< /review>

We got an oil change around 11am Sunday our 2004 BMW GRAY oil was changed by Jacob. I don’t know what he did but after he changed our oil our car started sputtering & also wasn’t accelerating. I’m guessing they overfilled my oil. It was very busy but no need to rush our service especially since we pay more seeing since we drive a foreign car. Also found that he broke one of my clamps that holds down the box to cover over the oil filter. My car is also making popcorn noses. Now I’m afraid to drive my car cause the engine could lock up leaving me with no vehicle and my fiancé has to get to work tonight. It is such an inconvenience to me as I have a 2 & 3 year old that ride in the back seat! I will be complaining and they need to fix what they did! I believe the guys name was Jacob!< /Text>

$70 for a 3.5 quart synthetic oil change. 5 quarts costs $25 retail on Amazon. Ridiculous. For a 10 minute service that's a $250/hr service charge. Oh, and I drove away with 2 missing tire stem caps. Go figure.</Review>

Literally had three people cut in front of me while I've been sitting here for over an hour waiting for an oil change... other than that it went smooth but come on I thought this was first come first serve? Whatever, I'll continue doin it myself. And yes, this was my first time here<//Review>

<pics>None< /pics><Text>Efficient, fast service. I really appreciate how committed they are to to calling out tasks as they are completed to verify with each other. Reminds me of operating room nurses doing the sponge count after a surgery. I don’t have to worry that I’m driving off leaking fluids because a cap wasn’t replaced. If I could change anything, it would be to ask them to please launder their American flag. The place proudly hangs flags in their shop from branches of the military as well as Old Glory, and the guys also have flag patches on their sleeves. So it’s clear that they care about the significance of our flag. It just made me squirm to see the US flag look so grimy.< /Text>< user_name>

<Rate>5< /Rate><text>Oil Changers in Pacifica definitely 10/10.  Workers here are friendly and helpful, service is done in a timely manner, price is fair and cheaper than Speedee and the Ford Dealership in Serramonte and done in 1/2 the time.  Best part is being able to sit in your car while getting your car serviced.  I’ve been here about 8 times and no matter what worker I have they all give great customer service.  Anthony helped us out today with our oil change, wipers change and coolant drain and he was awesome.  Thanks again Oil Changers Pacifica for your help, hard work, and keeping my car running smoothly.< /text></record>

< review>
agree with all the negative reviews. staff are friendly as you come in. said they topped off all fluids and check tire pressure and lights. after oil change i drove 5 miles and steam was coming out of the hood - coolant was spilling everywhere. when I took it back - they will not admit to any wrong doing. and then said they did not top off the fluids!!! so were they lying the first time?</review>

I will never go back here. They are terrible oil changers. They break things without telling you, over fill and under fill, and lie about topping off if you don't check while they do it. These guys are cheaters and will do anything to have you come back so they can say it's not there fault. The ruin cars. Many of my friends and I myself have agreed to never go back here because they aren't good and have ruined some of our cars.<//Review>

Why you shouldn't visit them: everything else

I went in for a oil change and came out with a flat tire all of a sudden. I mean extreme flat tire! Spent one minute waiting in line for a car wash after getting my car manhandled by C- graduates from Sequoia Institute and i had a complete flat tire. 35psi to 0.

These bros working there broke the tire valve nozzle on my back right tire and claim no responsibility.

Thanks to their ridiculous unprofessional attitude, and refusal to address the problem they caused, I've decided to berate them publicly and remove them from my businesses I stand behind.< /Review><Rating>1</Rating><Response>{'time': 1459274019540, 'text': "Brandon,\n\nPlease let me know if you haven't been contacted about your above concern.

<rate>5<//rate><text>I just went to Oil Changers on the top of the hill where Westborough turns into Sharp Park Road. Overall, I was very satisfied.

They let me bring in my own oil and filter. (Some places want to make you use their products which are sometimes not as good and over priced) I handed them the oil and the filter and they got to work right away while I waited right there in my car. Meanwhile, they also checked the tire pressure, lights and fluids and topped off whatever was low at the same time. They even brought the dipstick so I could see what the oil level was at before I left. I was in and out in only 15-20 minutes.

The fact that they were very friendly, kept me informed as they worked and did all this for $44 bucks, I would have to give them five stars for value, attention to detail and great customer service.

I will certainly be referring them to my friends.< /text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

Man in charge was very rude when I complained 4 cars in the bay next to my wife’s VW ( simple oil change) went through

It took nearly 50 minutes to change the oil on the VW Bug

I will never use or recommend this place I actually will tell people my experience too< /review>
